This study investigates the variability in operations across the global BF fleet and its impact on CO2 emissions. Using plant-level data from 2011 to 2021, we find that variation in the composition of inputs results in emissions ranging from 1.20 to 2.08 tons of CO2 per ton of hot metal (tCO2 tHM−1) globally, driven by differences in fuel and reductant consumption. Our estimates suggest global emissions could have been lower by 2.8%—and up to 9.6%—if each furnace operated at its historical or national minimum CO2 emissions intensity. We use furnace-level data to find even greater variation within and across individual furnaces at the national level, estimating potential for CO2 emissions reductions of 5.7%–15.5% in the United States. These findings suggest substantial latitude to incentivize plants to reduce CO2 emissions without new capital investment, by up to an estimated 1.35 billion tons of CO2 cumulatively across the global BF fleet from 2011–2021. It further underscores the limitations of relying on ‘best available technology’ or country-specific emissions factors in policy and planning efforts."

China, as both the world’s largest emitter and a region of rapid ecological change, plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. Yet uncertainties in atmospheric forcing datasets remain a significant source of uncertainty in land surface model simulations and are rarely assessed systematically. Here, we assess China’s terrestrial carbon budget (1979–2014) using the Community Land Model (CLM5.0) driven by three widely used meteorological datasets: CRUNCEP, the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3), and the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD), and evaluated against more than 800 FLUXNET site-months and nine eddy covariance towers. Forcing choice strongly alters the magnitude and trend of carbon fluxes, and China’s terrestrial ecosystems acted as either a weak carbon sink or a net source, depending on the forcing. GSWP3 performed best overall in simulating gross primary productivity (GPP), CRUNCEP relatively poorly, and CMFD best in high-altitude and cold-dry regions. Total ecosystem carbon storage was estimated at 86.30–90.00 PgC, primarily in soil (84.1%) and vegetation (15.9%). Interannual GPP variability was mainly controlled by precipitation (29.4%), followed by temperature (17.2%), while shortwave radiation had negative effects (11.5%). Shapley additive explanations analysis further showed that moisture-related variables (precipitation and humidity) dominate interannual GPP variability. By combining process-based modeling and machine learning, this study shows how uncertainties in meteorological inputs affect terrestrial carbon dynamics. These findings underscore the limitations of single-forcing simulations in Earth system modeling and highlight the need for improved meteorological inputs to support robust carbon budgeting and climate neutrality goals."

Despite abundant water sources, Nepal faces persistent water security challenges driven by extreme seasonality, rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and rapid land-use change. In this review, we synthesize current evidence on anthropogenic drivers of hydrological change in Nepal and draw lessons relevant to other data-sparse, high-mountain and monsoon-influenced regions. We find that warming-induced glacial retreat, altered snowmelt timing, and changing monsoon dynamics are intensifying wet-season flood risks while heightening dry-season water scarcity, patterns increasingly observed across the Himalaya, Andes, and other mountain systems. Human activities, including urban expansion, agricultural intensification, hydropower, and extraction of sediments from rivers, further modify river flows, reduce groundwater recharge, and increase vulnerability to extremes. Yet major uncertainties persist, especially concerning high-elevation hydrology, permafrost dynamics, sediment extraction, and the cumulative impacts of expanding infrastructure. Nepal’s pronounced topographic and climatic gradients limit broad generalizations, underscoring the need for region-specific hydrological monitoring and modeling. These challenges mirror global limitations in mountain hydrology, where sparse observations and rapidly changing conditions constrain predictive capacity. By identifying key knowledge gaps and highlighting cascading impacts on agriculture, hydropower, domestic water supply, and aquatic ecosystems, this review emphasizes the urgency of strengthening monitoring networks and integrating uncertainty into water management and climate adaptation strategies. Nepal’s experience offers broader insights for countries facing similar pressures at the intersection of climate change, development, and fragile mountain water systems."

Chloroform (CHCl3) is a prominent VSLS with poorly constrained anthropogenic sources that include its unintentional production when wood pulp is bleached for paper production. Recent assessments of the global CHCl3 budget have relied on emission factors (EFs) for the pulp/paper (PP) sector derived some 35 years ago when industrial practices were markedly different. Here, we analysed data from the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers of the USA, Canada and Japan. Combined with data on the national number of pulp mills and bleached wood pulp production volume, we derive plausible lower and upper limit EFs. These factors show a downward trend since the early 2000s, which we attribute to a continued phase-down in the use of ‘elemental chlorine’ bleaching in favour of ‘elemental chlorine free’ bleaching. The derived mean EFs for the period 2000–2020, expressed as the mass of CHCl3 per air–dried tons (adt) of bleached pulp, are in close agreement for the regions considered: USA (39.8 ± 32 g/adt), Canada (38.6 ± 29.8 g/adt) and Japan (30.1 ± 8.6 g/adt). Assuming these factors are broadly representative of other world regions, a mean annual global CHCl3 source of 3 (1–6) Gg yr−1 from the PP sector is estimated for the approximate 2000–2020 period. We conclude that the sector’s contribution to the global CHCl3 budget has likely decreased considerably since the 1990s and that the use of older EFs to calculate present-day emissions should be avoided."

Simultaneously, several other jurisdictions across the Global North are at various stages of implementing their own CBAs. With CBAs transitioning toward real implementation, it is vital to understand their implications for potentially vulnerable trading partners. To this end, we review the current literature on the economic and geopolitical impacts of the EU CBA mechanism (CBAM) on the Global South. Through taking stock of peer reviewed and grey literature, we conclude that the EU CBAM will lead to trade disruptions in the Global South, with some Global South countries particularly vulnerable to potential welfare losses as a result of these disruptions. The likely decrease in trade between the EU and parts of the Global South, and the associated economic impact, may in turn have wider implications for the international climate and trade regimes. Although the EU CBAM regulation does not exempt the world’s poorest states, the current upheaval in global trade presents an opportunity for EU policymakers and others considering CBAs to revisit exemption policies or explore alternatives for vulnerable trading partners. We conclude with outlining gaps in the current literature and propose directions for future study."

Yet mine-level inventories remain uncertain because publicly available measurements are sparse, outdated, and inconsistent. We assemble a 2011–2023 mine-level database of methane emission factors (EFs) by integrating the national coal-mine gas assessment with provincial disclosures and other sources. We harmonize definitions and impute missing data (10%–30% for key predictors; 23% for relative gas emissions) using a random-forest multiple-imputation framework incorporating geological and operational predictors and propagating uncertainty. The database reveals pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity, with a 92% reduction in small mines despite broadly stable national capacity. National production-weighted EFs declined from 5.39 kg t−1 in 2011 to 4.24 kg t−1 in 2020 as de-capacity policies retired high-emission mines and operational upgrades reduced intensities, and then rebounded to 4.78 kg t−1 in 2023, mainly due to higher production in provinces with above-average EFs, with a possible contribution from deeper mining. A persistent north–south gradient remains, and provinces dominated by coking coal exhibit systematically higher emissions. Selective non-disclosure by high-gas mines may introduce non-random missingness and bias the upper tail downward. Uncertainty analysis shows larger absolute but smaller relative errors for high-gas mines, with total uncertainty dominated by model generalization. The integrated dataset enables targeted mitigation at mine and provincial levels and provides a transparent basis for prioritizing high-emission and high-uncertainty regions. It highlights the need for standardized reporting, targeted measurements, and continuous updates to strengthen China’s coal-methane governance and NDC-aligned policy design."

This enhancement allows the model to ingest two dimensional fields of grid aggregated roof albedo and fractional rooftop area availability for HMS implementation. By incorporating these spatially varying inputs, the model overcomes previous limitations that relied on idealized scenarios. Using Austin, Texas, as a testbed metropolitan area, we assessed the realistic potential for cooling the city by reducing the 2 m air temperature (T2M) and universal thermal climate index (UTCI) through various HMS. Specifically, we evaluated cool roofs, green roofs, and solar photovoltaics under two scenarios: (i) complete roof area coverage and (ii) realistic implementation based on the available flat (non-pitched) roof area. Additionally, we implemented urban gardens and street trees and assessed their effectiveness in reducing T2M and UTCI. All experiments, including a control scenario without any HMS, were conducted during clear-sky days in August 2020, which was one of the hottest months recorded in Austin. The results indicate that while cool and green roofs are effective, their effectiveness is obfuscated in the city-wide mean T2M and UTCI reduction. Further, the realistic implementation of HMS had a negligible impact on city-wide mean T2M and UTCI. Nevertheless, these realistic rooftop simulations demonstrated potential for localized cooling in some areas of the city. Combining realistic rooftop-based HMS with urban gardens and street trees similarly resulted in limited city-wide cooling while yielding noticeable cooling in some grid cells. Street trees showed a large potential for locally reducing UTCI. These findings have direct implications for urban planning and heat mitigation approaches, as they highlight the need for evaluating HMS based on local (e.g. urban-block-scale) impacts using realistic implementation constraints, rather than emphasizing city-wide reductions in T2M or UTCI."

Karydis,Global perspectives on nitrate aerosol dynamics: a comprehensive sensitivity analysis,"Nitrate aerosol has become a dominant atmospheric component, surpassing sulfate in aerosol composition. However, its simulation remains challenging due to complex formation processes and regional variability. We use the EMAC model to assess key factors in nitrate predictions. Increasing grid resolution, reducing dinitrogen pentoxide hydrolysis uptake, and refining emissions improve model performance, although seasonal and diurnal discrepancies persist, requiring further refinement. 
 In recent years, nitrate aerosols have become a dominant component of atmospheric composition, surpassing sulfate in both concentration and climatic impact. However, accurately simulating nitrate remains a major challenge for global models due to complex formation mechanisms and strong regional variability. This study investigates key factors influencing nitrate aerosol formation to improve simulation accuracy in polluted regions. Using the EMAC climate–chemistry model and the ISORROPIA II thermodynamic module, we assess the effects of grid resolution, emission inventories, chemical kinetics, thermodynamic assumptions, and aerosol scavenging processes. Model predictions are evaluated against PM2.5 and PM1 nitrate observations from filter networks and aerosol mass spectrometer campaigns across Europe, North America, East Asia, and India. Results show that PM2.5 nitrate is generally overestimated, especially in East Asia (up to a factor of three), while PM1 nitrate is underestimated, particularly at urban-downwind sites. Higher grid resolution, adjusted N2O5 uptake, and updated emissions (e.g., CMIP6) improve PM2.5 predictions but do not consistently enhance PM1 accuracy. Seasonal and diurnal biases are most pronounced in Europe, where the model fails to capture observed nitrate variability. Sensitivity tests show limited impact on the total tropospheric nitrate burden (within 25 %). A combined configuration using high grid resolution, reduced N2O5 uptake, and the HTAPv3 emission inventory improves PM2.5 predictions in low-concentration periods and U.S. networks, but PM1 biases persist regionally. These findings highlight the difficulty of achieving consistent improvements across aerosol size modes and diverse geographic regions."

Using the new European EarthCARE satellite and its advanced laser instrument ATLID (Atmospheric LIDar), together with ground and balloon observations, we tracked how these particles doubled levels in the tropics and spread into both hemispheres. The study shows ATLID’s power to reveal how eruptions can affect climate, clouds, and ozone for more than a year. 
 The Atmospheric LIDar (ATLID) instrument of the ESA's Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite mission launched in May 2024 provides high-resolution vertical profiling of aerosols and clouds at 355 nm. Fully operational since July 2024, ATLID has been witness to a significant perturbation of stratospheric aerosol budget following the eruptions of Ruang volcano (Indonesia) in late April 2024. Using ATLID together with limb-viewing satellite instruments (OMPS-LP and SAGE III), we quantify the stratospheric aerosol perturbation generated by the Ruang eruption and characterize the global transport of volcanic aerosols. To evaluate the ATLID performance in the stratosphere, its data are compared with collocated ground-based lidar observations at various locations in both hemispheres and overpass-coordinated balloon flights carrying AZOR backscatter sonde. The intercomparison with suborbital observations suggests excellent performance of ATLID in the stratosphere and proves its capacity to accurately resolve fine structures in the vertical distribution of stratospheric aerosols. Using various satellite observations, we show that Ruang's eruptive sequence in April 2024 produced eruptive columns reaching 25 km altitude, and resulted in a doubling of the tropical stratospheric aerosol abundance for several months. The eruption timing in austral Fall and its high-altitude reach fostered efficient poleward transport into the southern extratropics during austral Winter 2024. By the time of the austral Fall 2025, the sulphate aerosols from Ruang have spread across the entire Southern hemisphere and were most probably entrained by the 2025 Antarctic polar vortex, potentially enhancing the polar stratospheric cloud occurrence."

By integrating field observations with thermodynamic modeling, we show that ammonia and aerosol water dominate acidity control under typical conditions, whereas sea-salt cations prevail during typhoons. These findings reveal that extreme weather can alter the governing mechanisms of aerosol acidity, with implications for air quality and climate evaluation. 
 Aerosol acidity plays a crucial role in multiphase atmospheric chemistry, influencing aerosol composition, gas-particle partitioning, and the oxidative capacity of atmosphere. However, the mechanisms governing aerosol acidity in coastal areas under extreme weather remains challenging due to the complexity of atmospheric transport. Here, we investigate aerosol pH in Shenzhen, a coastal megacity in China, by integrating field observations with multiphase buffer theory and ISORROPIA simulations. Our observations captured both a typhoon episode and typical non-typhoon periods with two contrasting regimes: during non-typhoon periods, aerosols were consistently buffered by the NH4+/NH3 pair, with relative humidity serving as the primary driver of pH variability, enabling reliable predictions using multiphase buffer theory. In contrast, during a typhoon episode, nonvolatile cations derived from sea salts emerged as the dominant drivers, violating the charge balance for NH4+/NH3 buffering and leading to poor performance of buffer theory. ISORROPIA simulations under the assumption of constant aerosol water content reproduced the observed pH more reliably, highlighting a compositional rather than meteorological control. Our results provide direct field-based evidence for regime shifts in aerosol acidity regulation in coastal regions and underscore the need for chemical transport models to account for composition-meteorology interactions to improve acidity predictions under extreme weather events."

This study has three objectives, (1) to evaluate HPR retrievals, (2) to exploit the combination of dual-frequency (DF) space-borne radar (SR) and dual-polarisation (DP) ground-based radar (GR) observations for estimating HPRs based on SR DF observations and (3) to further improve HPR estimates based on DP GR observations. 
 Conventional radar-based hydrometeor classification algorithms identify the dominant hydrometeor type within a resolved radar volume, while newer techniques estimate the proportions of individual hydrometeor classes (hydrometeor partitioning ratios, HPRs) within a mixture. These newer algorithms (HMCP) are based on dual-polarization measurements from ground-based radars (GR), while to date no comparable algorithms for space-borne radars (SR) with dual-frequency capabilities exist. This study (1) further improves HPR estimates based on GR dual-polarization measurements, (2) exploits the combination of dual-frequency SR and dual-polarization GR to introduce HPRs based on dual-frequency observations only, and (3) evaluates GR- and SR-based HPR retrievals. To achieve these objectives, dual-polarization measurements of NEXRAD's GRs are matched with those of the dual-frequency precipitation radar of the Global Precipitation Measurement Core satellite. All matched volumes are represented by averaged dual-frequency and dual-polarization observations and several hundred GR sub-volumes classified with standard hydrometeor classification. The latter are used to calculate quasi-HPRs (qHPRs). qHPRs and averaged dual-frequency and dual-polarization variables of the training dataset are used to derive covariances and centroids for each hydrometeor class. They serve as the basis for dual-frequency and dual-polarization based HPR retrievals within HMCP and are applied to the test dataset. The ensuing evaluation of HPR retrievals is performed with the qHPRs of the test dataset. HPRs show for most hydrometeor classes high correlations with the qHPRs and confirm the overall good HMCP performance. However, dual-polarization based classification performance is superior to dual-frequency ones. Both underestimate snow, overestimate graupel, and result in low correlations for big drops."

This study shows that surface-based spectral irradiance combined with deep neural network models can accurately estimate PWV under various atmospheric conditions. Models using global, direct, and diffuse irradiances performed best, while even global-only data gave reliable results. 
 Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a key component of Earth's climate and hydrological systems, yet its accurate and continuous observation under varying sky conditions remains challenging. This study demonstrates the strong potential of surface-based spectral irradiance measurements for PWV retrieval across a range of atmospheric conditions using deep neural network (DNN) models trained on water vapor absorption bands. Global, direct, and diffuse spectral irradiances observed at water vapor absorption bands of 929.0–997.3, 800.9–840.5, and 708.1–744.6 nm by a spectroradiometer (MS-700; EKO Instruments Co., Ltd., Japan) equipped with a rotating shadow-band system were used as test data, while PWV observed by a microwave radiometer (MP-1500; Radiometrics Corporation, USA) served as reference data for model training and validation. Models incorporating global, direct, and diffuse irradiances achieved the highest accuracy, exhibiting minimal errors and closely capturing seasonal PWV variations. Notably, even models using only global irradiance – an easier and more accessible measurement – maintained high predictive performance, with low errors and robust seasonal tracking. In contrast, models trained solely on clear-sky direct irradiance with substantially fewer samples than those under all-sky conditions showed relatively higher errors and weaker generalization, underscoring the importance of data volume and diversity in DNN models. These results highlight the effectiveness of spectral irradiance-based approaches for continuous PWV estimation across a range of atmospheric conditions. Future research should incorporate additional spectral bands sensitive to constituents like aerosols and ozone to expand retrieval capability."

 Climate change and extreme weather events pose challenges to food security, emphasizing the need for reliable and timely monitoring of crop and rangeland conditions. For this purpose, long-term consistent Earth Observation datasets on vegetation conditions are typically used in early warning and crop yield forecast systems. However, the near-real-time (NRT) production of high quality datasets and the need to guarantee long-term records present various challenges. To address these, we present a NRT global dataset of Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) at 500 m resolution, optimized for agricultural applications. Our dataset combines MODIS-FPAR (Collection 6.1) and VIIRS-FPAR (Collection 2) data, ensuring continuity from 2000 to well beyond 2030.  We applied a robust filtering approach based on the Whittaker smoother to produce reliable FPAR estimates in NRT, accounting for sparse and irregular spaced observations due to cloud cover. The dataset is composed of two 10 d filtered timeseries: (1) MODIS-FPAR for 2000 to 2023, being the reference dataset, and (2) intercalibrated VIIRS-FPAR for 2018 onward. While several methods can effectively smooth and gap-fill FPAR data (i.e., using observations before and after the estimation date), our method is designed for optimal filtering in NRT (i.e., using only prior observations). Our approach yields six successive  estimates of the same FPAR data point with increasing quality: an inital estimate immediately after the 10 d reference period, four subsequent estimates every 10 d using new observations, and a final consolidated estimate 90 d later. The implemented filtering ingests the available FPAR observations and their original quality assessment (QA) layers. To avoid unrealistic extrapolation when observations are sparse, we impose constraints, season and location specific, to FPAR estimates.  We then intercalibrated the VIIRS-FPAR with the MODIS-FPAR filtered timeseries, using a mean difference correction approach, to ensure consistency between both series. This paper describes the filtering and intercalibration method used, the quality assessment of resulting timeseries, and details the obtained products and the corresponding QA layers. The NRT FPAR dataset is publicly available through the Joint Research Centre Data Catalogue, https://doi.org/10.2905/1aac79d8-0d68-4f1c-a40f-b6e362264e50 (Seguini et al., 2025)."

Over the course of the time-series, multiple measurement methodologies, sampling frequencies, and sub-site positions have been used for different periods. Resulting from this, two separate datasets have been created and publicised for usage, the quality controlled full-resolution measurement dataset (https://doi.org/10.20393/85D35444-2FB3-4791-A977-AE29BB3B3CFC, Marine Institute, 2025b), and a standardised daily average dataset (https://doi.org/10.20393/314DE8E2-79F0-4D36-B2BE-EE2A7E5590E2 Marine Institute, 2025a), the latter of which has undergone various processing steps, including removal of a diurnal signal. The standardised dataset creates and will continue a valuable, longstanding continuous time series which allows for more simplified long-term trend analysis compared with observation collections, which differ in measurement types and frequencies. The Malin Head sea surface temperature data, alongside a co-located tide gauge dataset are instrumental in understanding coastal ocean climate change in the region. Both datasets included are made available through the Marine Institute's Data Catalogue, have been assigned DOIs, and are made available from the Marine Institute's ERDDAP service."

Airborne and handheld laser scanner now map 1,194 of these sinkholes in one basin, showing they have quietly swallowed 345,000 t of soil. The open dataset gives the world its first high-resolution case study for mapping and managing loess sinkholes, proving that this soil-piping process deserves urgent attention, not neglect. 
 From the perspective of the world, the basic mapping and investigation of the loess sinkhole is far less extensive and in-depth than that of the karst sinkhole survey. To some extent, this hinders people’s understanding of the morphological characteristics, development rules, and formation mechanisms of the loess sinkholes. Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) has the most typical loess landform in the world, and tens of thousands of loess sinkholes have developed. However, due to the lack of high-precision and high-resolution survey data, the identification, characterization, and quantification of sinkholes in the Loess Plateau are basically blank, which seriously hinders the in-depth study of loess sinkholes. We investigated a typical watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau using photogrammetry, airborne laser scanning, and handheld laser scanner. Based on previous studies, this paper proposes indices and methods for the morphological quantification of loess sinkholes and constructs the first dataset of loess sinkhole morphology containing 1194 records at the basin scale. On this basis, we completed the spatial mapping of loess sinkholes, analysis of distribution patterns, morphological analysis, size-frequency analysis, fitting analysis of different parameters, estimation of subsurface soil erosion, in-depth investigation of typical sinkholes, and quantification of the contributions of different factors to sinkhole development. These efforts provide rich information for a deeper understanding of the morphological characteristics and causes of loess sinkholes and offer data support for comparative studies with sinkholes in other regions. More critically, we preliminarily assessed that the subsurface soil erosion triggered by sinkholes in the study area amounts to as high as 345,000 metric tons. This finding makes it increasingly clear that loess sinkholes are not only a geological disaster process but also a serious soil loss process, highlighting their undeniable significance in regional soil erosion studies and laying a solid foundation for subsequent research and disaster prevention efforts. Moreover, we believe that the integration of airborne laser scanning and handheld laser scanning may represent a new trend in the detailed investigation of sinkholes in the future. The dataset is available from Zenodo platform (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14000267)."

The dataset reveals a 45.87 % expansion of Chinese oases, mainly driven by cropland expansion and grassland restoration. The consistent, high-resolution OasisMap30 dataset provides a valuable basis for investigating oasis landscape dynamics, socio-ecological responses, and sustainable development in dryland regions. 
 High spatio-temporal resolution maps of oasis land cover are valuable for understanding ecological and societal development processes in dryland regions. However, the relatively late development of oasis research, combined with the highly fragmented structure of oases and their frequent land cover transitions, has made it challenging to construct high spatio-temporal resolution land cover datasets for oases. As a result, dedicated data products of this kind are still lacking. Here, we developed a framework for annual 30 m land cover mapping that integrates Landsat satellite imagery, machine learning, a temporal segmentation approach (LandTrendr), and principal component analysis. Using this framework, we produced a 30 m resolution annual land-cover dataset for Chinese oases (OasisMap30) for the period 1987–2024 on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Accuracy assessment based on more than 6,300 visually interpreted samples demonstrates high accuracy of OasisMap30 (overall accuracy >90 %). In cross-product comparisons based on visually interpreted and third-party test samples, OasisMap30 exhibits considerable advantages in terms of classification accuracy and error reduction. Moreover, in comparison with several 30 m resolution thematic products for impervious surface, cropland, and surface water, we found an impressive consistency between OasisMap30 and these datasets. Using OasisMap30, we investigated the changes in land cover patterns of Chinese oases. The results show that oasis area expanded by 45.87 % (+7.75 Mha) between 1987 and 2024, primarily driven by cropland expansion and grassland restoration. Specifically, 4.04 Mha of desert were restored to grassland, and 3.19 Mha were converted from desert to cropland. In addition, OasisMap30 reveals the expansion of impervious surfaces (0.58 Mha) and surface water (0.35 Mha), as well as conversions among land cover types, such as the conversion of 3.12 Mha of grassland to cropland. Overall, the consistent, high-resolution OasisMap30 data can substantially support studies on the evolution of oasis landscape patterns, socio-ecological responses, and spatial pattern optimization, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of oasis regions.

Harrington,"Earthquake Catalog and Continuous Waveforms from a Two-Week Distributed Acoustic Sensing experiment on Kefalonia Island, Greece","This study uses two weeks of new distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data with permanent seismic stations to construct a detailed catalog of small earthquakes around Kefalonia Island (Greece). The analysis revealed thousands of tiny events, many clustered offshore northwest of Kefalonia. The publicly available dataset, including the catalog and continuous DAS waveforms, supports testing of new DAS methods and analysis of complex seismic sequences. 
 This work presents a high-resolution earthquake catalog for the Kefalonia region, Greece, built from the analysis of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data recorded on a telecommunications cable between 1 August 2024, 23:00 and 15 August 2024, 23:00, together with open-access seismic station recordings. The DAS data consist of continuous strain recordings on a 15 km-long telecommunication optical fiber connecting northern Kefalonia and Ithaki. We use a semblance-based detector on the DAS waveforms to identify 5,734 earthquakes within ~ 50 km of the fiber origin. We jointly locate 284 high-SNR events with DAS and seismic stations and calculate their local magnitudes from seismic records. We then apply waveform cross-correlation to match unlocated detections with the most similar template events and estimate relative magnitudes from amplitude ratios to enhance the constructed catalog. Enhancement adds 2,496 earthquakes, resulting in 2,780 events with assigned locations and magnitudes. Most events (2,718) cluster within a ~ 5 km radius offshore northwest of Kefalonia, where seismicity rates reach >100 events per hour. Our dataset provides a detailed spatio-temporal view of seismicity in a region with limited station coverage and demonstrates the value of integrating DAS with conventional seismic networks to monitor intense earthquake sequences. The combination of high seismicity and open-access data from the Hellenic Unified Seismic Network makes this DAS dataset particularly valuable for the seismological community. We provide a 2-week-long catalog, the full detection list (local and distant events and false detections), and two weeks of continuous DAS recordings. The aim is to provide a resource for researchers to test, develop, and benchmark DAS processing algorithms on tectonic earthquakes and to investigate the physical processes that drive complex seismic sequences."

It demonstrates robust performance across a wide range of conditions, capturing spatial structures in an intuitive and physically meaningful way. This new metric offers researchers an improved tool for evaluating and inter-comparing climate models. 
 Developing and evaluating spatial efficiency metrics is essential for assessing how well climate or other models of the Earth's system reproduce the observed patterns of variables like precipitation, temperature, atmospheric pollutants, and other environmental data presented in a gridded format. In this study, we propose a new metric, the Modified Spatial Efficiency (MSPAEF), designed to overcome limitations identified in existing metrics, such as the Spatial Efficiency (SPAEF), the Wasserstein Spatial Efficiency (WSPAEF), or the Spatial Pattern Efficiency metric (Esp). The performance of MSPAEF is systematically compared to these metrics across a range of synthetic data scenarios characterized by varying spatial correlation coefficients, biases, and standard deviation ratios. Results demonstrate that MSPAEF consistently provides robust and intuitive performance, accurately capturing spatial patterns under diverse conditions. Additionally, two realistic but synthetic case studies are presented to further evaluate the practical applicability of the metrics. In both examples, MSPAEF delivers results that align with intuitive expectations, while the other metrics exhibit limitations in identifying specific features in at least one case. Finally, as a real-world application, we rank global Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) model data according to their skill in representing precipitation and temperature using the four different metrics. This application highlights that the MSPAEF rankings are most similar with Esp with a normalized absolute ranking difference of 2.8 for precipitation, and 3.8 for temperature. These findings highlight the added value of the MSPAEF metric in evaluating spatial distributions and its potential to be used in climate or other environmental model evaluation or inter-comparison exercises."

In this study, the anaerobic degradation of carbon tetrachloride (CT), chloroform (CF), trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) and TCE was assessed using S-nZVI at seven S loadings ([S/Fe] = 0.01–0.303). S-nZVI0.01 yielded the highest degradation rate constants for CT, 1,1,1-TCA, and CF, which were 1.77–10.9 times higher than those of nZVI and other S-nZVI. In contrast, S-nZVI0.075 yielded the highest rate constant for TCE. S-nZVI0.01 provides the most rapid electron release, and because CT, 1,1,1-TCA, and CF have higher electron affinity than water, their degradation is the quickest at this [S/Fe]. TCE degradation was faster only at higher [S/Fe], where S-nZVI reactivity to water was diminished and S-nZVI0.075 provided a 20-fold enhancement in electron selectivity to TCE over H2O. Although TCE was completely dechlorinated, the other CHCs were only partially dechlorinated. The degradation products dichloromethane and 1,1-dichloroethane were dechlorinated in the presence of their parent CHCs and at specific [S/Fe], although they were not dechlorinated as sole compounds. The results demonstrate that dechlorination rates and extents of CHCs can be optimized by tuning the sulfidation dose."

Here, we developed a 14C-nanotracing platform integrated with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to achieve subpicogram sensitivity for organ-level quantification of inhaled PM. 14C-labeled black carbon PM was generated via pyrolysis of 14C-n-hexane and introduced into a controlled inhalation chamber. ICR mice (n = 7) were exposed to short-intense (1 h, high concentration) and long-mild (3 h day–1 for 7 days, low concentration) protocols to represent acute and subchronic exposure conditions. Quantitative AMS analysis revealed systemic translocation of carbonaceous PM, with organ burdens following the order lung > liver > kidney > brain. After short-term exposure, 360 pg accumulated in the liver, 120 pg in the kidney, and 4.8 pg in brain tissue, whereas prolonged exposure increased these burdens by 3–6-fold, reaching 15 pg in the brain. These findings indicate substantial retention of PM across multiple organs including neural tissues of the brain. This 14C-nanotracing approach enables a quantitative framework for linking inhaled PM exposure to systemic burden, supporting toxicokinetic modeling and evidence-based air quality regulation."

In this study, we applied a bespoke geochemical framework to samples collected from 401 Canadian nonproducing wells and determined methane origins for 112 samples originating from either surface casing vent (SCV) or wellhead emissions at 100 of these wells. We found that the presence of thermogenic methane at the SCV is a good indicator of high-emission wells, with average emission magnitudes  500 times higher than those of microbial sources. Our results also show that half of the studied wells emit a mix of thermogenic and microbial methane. Compared to previous estimates, our percentage of wells emitting microbial methane (∼23%) is three times higher, and the associated median emission rate is 1000 times greater.

In this study, machine learning-based regression models were integrated with the mobile–immobile water (MIM) model for solute transport to develop a data-driven framework for deriving site-specific AF values of As in the vadose zone. The regression models were applied to rapidly estimate MIM modeling parameters related to the transport and fate of As based on readily available soil properties for the vadose zone. As transport was simulated by considering infiltrations controlled by both retardation and remobilization induced by wet–dry cycles. When applied to 21 sites across South Korea, the framework yielded AF values of >1 at all locations with substantial variability (3.56–24.38), which highlights the buffering capacity of the vadose zone and the necessity of site-specific assessment. This scalable framework offers a practical alternative to conventional reactive transport models that facilitates reliable risk assessments of As groundwater contamination by the infiltrates through the vadose zone."

Integrating CDMS as a biocathode significantly boosted power output, achieving 24.5 ± 1.5 W/m3 volumetric and 2.5 ± 0.2 W/m2 areal power densities at the steady stage, with advantages persisting despite degradation due to cathode performance being the principal determinant of MFC functionality. Comparative analysis indicated that both CDMS and carbon brush cathodes played indispensable roles in sustaining dual-cathode MFC high-performance and stability. The bifunctional CDMS in dual-cathode MFC established a self-reinforcing cycle of substrate limitation, oxygen allocation, and electron transfer optimization, fundamentally addressing the stability-performance trade-off in the MFC system.

The framework further integrates coastal geomorphological and tidal characteristics to account for the regulating effects of natural processes on plastic emissions. To systematically characterize pollution severity, we proposed the Coastal Plastic Pollution Index (CPPI), which classifies coastal input sites into four levels (I–IV) based on estimated emission. The model estimated global coastal plastic emission in 2019 between 15.32 and 59.18 Kt, with per capita values ranging from 2.17 to 8.38 g.

The quantification of the impacts of extreme events on crop yield has predominantly concentrated on individual events like drought or heat. Numerous instances have showcased the destructive effects of compound extreme events on crop yields, surpassing those of individual events. However, their influence extent is region‐specific and not fully understood in Australia's crop belt. Using a biophysical‐statistical modeling approach, we quantified the individual impacts of drought, heat, frost, and compound drought and extreme temperature (DET) events on wheat yield variations in Australia. We first developed indices for these different extreme events during the wheat reproductive period based on the APSIM (Agricultural Production System sIMulator) model and then used these indices in multiple linear regression models to quantify their impacts on wheat yield variations. We found that, during 1990–2021, drought, heat, and frost events explained 48% of yield variation, while the percentage increased to 54% after including DET events, with some regions even up to 86%. In extreme low‐yield years, the relative importance of DET events surpassed the sum importance of individual drought, heat, and frost events, reaching 52% in years with yields below the 10th percentiles, respectively. Our findings highlight the need to factor compound extreme weather events into climate risk management to inform the mitigation of yield losses or crop failure."

 Modern computing powers applications from data analysis to artificial intelligence but now faces limitations. The slowdown of device scaling and the bottleneck between memory and processors motivate architectures that unify computation and data storage. Convolution is a core operation in learning, vision, and signal processing, yet its conventional implementation incurs high energy, high latency, and limited scalability. Magnetic systems that host spin textures, such as domain walls, offer dynamic behaviors that enable computation beyond traditional logic. Here we introduce a compute-in-memory platform that performs convolution by sequentially shifting magnetic domains and sensing the resulting signals. Information is written directly into domain patterns, processed through controlled motion, and read electrically, forming a nonvolatile structure suited for convolution tasks. This approach supports applications including Fourier analysis, neural networks, and image processing, achieving 103 to 105 improvements in area, energy, and throughput over existing technologies, marking a concrete advance in spintronic computing.

 Wind power is widely recognized as a key component of future net-zero energy systems. However, substantial variability among current wind resource and power simulations used for wind farm deployment limits the reliability of siting and system integration decisions. Therefore, we present a transparent, open source, validated and evaluated, global wind power simulation workflow for the renewable energy simulation tool ETHOS.RESKit. As the first wind simulation workflow using the new Global Wind Atlas 4 and the fifth iteration of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis, it is capable of simulating time-resolved energy output of wind turbines with high spatial resolution and customizable designs for both onshore and offshore wind turbines. The tool has undergone an extensive validation and calibration process using over 18 million global measurements from meteorological masts for wind speed bias correction and 8 million measurements from wind turbine sites across 6 countries during 2002 to 2021. In comparison with measured energy yield from wind turbine sites, we achieve a global average capacity factor mean error of 5.6% and Pearson correlation of 0.844. In addition, we evaluate its performance against annually aggregated energy production data from operational wind farms and country-level wind power generation statistics reported by energy agencies, demonstrating its accuracy across multiple spatial and temporal scales with a mean error of only 0.6%. Additionally, a final calibration step ensures alignment of the simulation with real world statistics. The release of ETHOS.RESKit is a step towards a fully open source and open data approach to accurate wind power modeling by incorporating comprehensive simulation advances in one model.

Here, the authors show that IL-36 agonists are systemic inflammatory factors released from aged skin to promote senescence in joint cells and aggravate OA progression. 
 Age-related inflammation plays a pivotal role in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis, but the mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we identify decreased IL-36 receptor antagonists (IL-36Ra) in epidermal keratinocytes from a premature-aged skin mice model, aged mice and patients. Decreased IL-36Ra leads to increased secretion of IL-36 agonists to serum and joints, which activates proinflammatory signaling and promotes senescence in chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts, thereby aggravates OA progression. Deletion of IL-36Ra in keratinocytes exacerbates, whereas intra-articular inhibition of IL-36R signaling effectively attenuates OA progression in male mice. Moreover, we also generate microneedles loaded with mouse recombinant IL-36Ra protein or spesolimab, insert them directly into skin to sustainably inhibit IL-36R signaling, which both clearly attenuate OA progression in male mice. Overall, our results reveal that IL-36 agonists are age-related systemic inflammatory factors released from skin to joints and contribute to OA development, and targeting IL-36R signaling in aged skin with microneedles represents a promising disease-modifying approach.

Here, the authors show that feedback shifts risk-taking by changing attitudes rather than through learning. 
 Decision-making under risk is often studied with fully described lotteries, where normative theory predicts that post-choice outcome disclosure (feedback) should not influence preferences. However, previous empirical work has generally shown that feedback does affect risk-taking, yet, without reaching a consensus on the consequences of feedback or the underlying cognitive mechanisms. Here, across seven behavioral experiments, we disentangle two competing accounts: the learning hypothesis, where feedback alters subjective values through experience, and the attitudinal hypothesis, where feedback changes preferences in anticipation of outcomes. We find that feedback does not improve maximization but consistently increases risk-taking. Fine-grained temporal analyses reveal that this effect emerges before any outcomes are experienced, ruling out learning as the primary driver. Moreover, the increase of risk-taking in partial feedback seems to be driven by curiosity, while in complete feedback by anticipated regret. Our results indicate that feedback can bias decision-making primarily through attitudinal rather than learning mechanisms. Normative theory predicts that feedback should not affect decisions under risk, but past findings disagree.

 Cortical implants are a proven clinical neurotechnology with the potential to transform our understanding of cognitive processes. These processes rely on complex neuronal networks that are difficult to selectively probe or stimulate. Optogenetics offers cell-type specificity, but achieving the density and coverage required for chronic, high-resolution modulation remains a challenge. We fabricated 100-element μLED arrays (200 μm pixel pitch, 2 × 2 mm2 footprint) coupled into chronically implantable systems for optogenetic stimulation of the mouse cortex. The μLEDs remain stable for over 300 hours continuous operation time in vivo, allowing for months-long chronic experiments. Simultaneous electrophysiology recordings confirmed robust neuronal responses at low μLED drive currents (< 5 mA), minimising thermal effects. Here we show that our device can be chronically implanted in freely-behaving mice and drive behavioural outcomes from spatiotemporal, patterned, optogenetic stimulation of auditory cortical circuits.

 Pneumonic plague remains a high-consequence respiratory disease, highlighting the need for vaccines that induce durable lung-localized immunity. We show that intramuscular prime-boost vaccination with Alum-absorbed OMV46-LcrV (OMV46-LcrV/Alum) is safe but provides limited long-term protection against respiratory Yersinia pestis challenge in mice. To enhance lung immunity, we deliver an adjuvant-free intranasal LcrV “spike” following IM OMV46-LcrV/Alum priming. This “prime-spike” regimen is well tolerated and confers complete short- and long-term protection against high-dose pulmonary Y. pestis challenge. The approach increases lung resident memory B cells, including antibody-secreting cells, and resident memory T cells with elevated Interferon-γ, Interleukin-17A, and Interleukin-4 production. These localized memory responses contribute to improved protection, demonstrating the promising potential of prime-spike immunization for combating pneumonic plague.

 The Northwest Pacific Subtropical High (NWPSH) presents a notable and even counterintuitive phenomenon: it shows a strong positive correlation between June and August (correlation coefficient: 0.55, significant at the 99.5% confidence level) during 1979–2005, while this correlation weakens sharply to -0.05 in 2006–2024. However, the relationships between June and July, and between July and August remain consistently weak throughout the entire period. Positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical North Indian Ocean (TNIO) contribute to a persistent intensification of the NWPSH from June to August before 2005. Meanwhile, the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation (BSISO) exhibits a stronger 60-day periodicity, which can cause opposite (similar) variations of NWPSH in adjacent month (cross-month). Under the combined effects of TNIO SST positive anomalies and BSISO, the NWPSH mainly exhibits the cross-month correlation feature, while the relationships between adjacent months are very weak. After 2005, the BSISO exhibits a marked shortening of its periodicity, and the key SST regions associated with the NWPSH in June, July, and August are also inconsistent, which induce the weakening of the cross-month correlation feature of the NWPSH. The shortening of the BSISO’s periodicity is attributed to warming over the Maritime Continent and the tropical western Indian Ocean, which intensify both the zonal Walker and meridional Hadley circulations. These changes enhance downward motions over the tropical eastern Indian Ocean and the northwestern Pacific, thereby suppressing the initiation of BSISO’ convection and accelerating its decay."

 Western North America (WNA) is a regional hotspot for summer heat extremes. However, our understanding of the atmospheric processes driving WNA heatwaves remains largely based on a few case studies. In this study, we investigate the general characteristics of atmospheric pathways associated with WNA heatwaves using a 30-member high-resolution coupled model simulation. Synthesizing the WNA heatwave events across the large ensemble, we reinforce the view that WNA heatwaves are systematically driven by: (1) a Rossby wave train originating from the western North Pacific, (2) poleward moisture transport toward the Gulf of Alaska, occasionally via atmospheric rivers, and (3) downstream ridge amplification over WNA. Although these features also appear in the late twenty-first-century projections, notable changes include farther poleward moisture transport and broader ridge development in the future. Under the anomaly-based heatwave definition used in this study, which removes the influence of mean temperature change, the frequency of WNA heatwaves is projected to decrease. Our findings suggest that mechanisms identified in case studies, including upstream Rossby wave packets and subsequent moist processes, are broadly applicable to understanding WNA heatwaves over recent decades and their projected changes."

Climate model simulations, accounting for the multi-episode nature of the eruption, were validated by observational reconstructions of the climate response. 
 Northern Eurasia tropospheric winter warming has been observed and modeled after major tropical volcanic eruptions. Here we show that a high-latitude eruption with a persistent stratospheric volcanic cloud from summer to early winter can also trigger winter warming. Our model simulations, incorporating updated volcanic forcing for the 1783 Laki eruption, closely align with two recent temperature reconstructions—whereas simulations of other eruptions lacking substantial cold-season aerosol loadings fail to produce such warming. The aerosol-induced mid-latitude stratospheric warming strengthens the meridional temperature gradient, enhances the polar vortex, and shifts both horizontal and vertical energy redistribution in favor of Northern Eurasia winter warming. Neutral or cold winters, nevertheless, remain possible in individual realizations due to internal variability. These findings help resolve model-observation discrepancies and highlight the crucial role of stratosphere-troposphere coupling in shaping large-scale circulation patterns in the aftermath of volcanic eruptions.

Leveraging this relationship, we introduce a constraining framework to enhance the accuracy of regional climate projections. The mechanism is that the changes in DTR are primarily driven by external forces such as greenhouse gas emissions, rather than internal climate variability. Increasing greenhouse gases reduces cloud cover, which migrates DTR decline by enhancing daytime shortwave radiation and reducing nighttime longwave radiation.

 In the late twentieth century, nighttime land surface temperatures are observed to rise faster than daytime temperatures, resulting in high diurnal temperature ranges and considerable diurnal asymmetric warming. Nevertheless, the projected changes in diurnal temperature ranges under global warming remain with large uncertainties across statistical multi-model simulations. Here, we identify an emergent relationship between historical diurnal temperature ranges variability and future projections on both global and regional scales. By leveraging this spatially heterogeneous relationship, we present a framework to refine regional projections, reducing model uncertainties by 15–68% across the 27 IPCC AR6 reference regions.

 Abundant graphitized organic matter within 3.7-billion-year-old sediments in the Isua Supracrustal Belt comprises the oldest remnants of life. This organic matter could have provided a favorable substrate for anaerobically respiring microbes, though their existence in the early Archean remains uncertain. Here we assess whether anaerobic respiration, linked to reduction of iron and sulfur, operated within these ancient sediments. We analyzed carbon and sulfur isotope data from pelagic and turbiditic sedimentary rocks, sampled from a rock core, and used petrography and iron concentrations to provide geological context. Carbon isotopic compositions indicate respiration of organic compounds, with lighter values associated with iron-rich samples, consistent with respiration coupled to iron reduction. Sulfide grains in pelagic layers have isotopic compositions consistent with reduction of atmospherically produced elemental sulfur, possibly with minor contributions from sulfate reduction during sedimentary hiatuses. These results suggest that early Archean ecosystems were sustained by multiple, interacting microbial metabolisms.

 Offshore wind farms are increasingly shaping coastal ocean dynamics, yet their cumulative physical impacts remain poorly quantified. Using decade-long, high-resolution simulations of the North Sea, we show that large-scale offshore wind development can reduce current velocities by up to $$20 \%$$ and reshape local tidal energy distributions. Wind and tidal wakes exert distinct but interacting influences on ocean physics: wind speed anomalies drive far-field hydrodynamic impacts, while structure-induced drag intensifies local turbulence and mixing. Turbine spacing emerges as a key control on wake interactions, governing the formation of high-turbulence hotspots. The near- and far-field wake effects affect vertical mixing and surface heat fluxes – primarily driven by large-scale wind stress reductions – leading to shallower mixed layers and long-term surface warming of up to $$0.2\,^{\circ} \,{{{\rm{C}}}}$$ in wind farm areas. Our findings reveal a basin-scale physical footprint of offshore wind energy and highlight the need to account for hydrodynamic impacts in future offshore wind farm planning.

 Recent decades have witnessed increasing snow droughts in the Northern Hemisphere, yet reliable future projections remain challenging due to biases in climate models. This study employs a Cumulative Distribution Function-transform bias correction method to refine Snow Water Equivalent outputs from 29 CMIP6 models, enabling a robust assessment of future snow drought characteristics using the Snow Water Equivalent Index. Our analysis reveals a fundamental structural shift in snow drought regimes under high-emission scenarios. While the frequency and duration of less severe droughts may stabilize or even decline, the most extreme droughts intensify dramatically—becoming more frequent, prolonged, and severe. This escalation is strongly tied to emission levels, with the SSP585 scenario projecting a 54.5% increase in duration and a six-fold rise in intensification trends compared to sustainable pathways.

These findings underscore the critical need for rapid emission reductions to mitigate escalating snow drought risks and their profound implications for water resources, ecosystems, and socioeconomic stability. Under high-emission scenarios by 2100, exceptional snow droughts will increase in frequency and duration, particularly affecting water-stressed areas such as Europe, western Asia, and central North America, according to a Cumulative Distribution Function-transform bias correction method."

 The Triassic–Jurassic transition marks a critical interval, witnessing major biotic turnovers, including the rise of dinosaurs and the end-Triassic mass extinction, triggered by the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. However, the volcanism linked to terrestrial ecosystem disturbance and dinosaur distribution remains poorly constrained. Here we present an integrated dataset of chemostratigraphic and astrochronological records for a continental drill core from the Kunming Basin in Yunnan Province of Southwest China, where rich dinosaur assemblages have been previously identified. Three negative carbon isotope excursions coupled with volcanogenic mercury anomalies confirm pulsed volcanism-induced environmental impacts on this subtropical terrestrial setting and placement of the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. Critically, the earliest regional sauropodomorph fossils occurred at ~200.17 Ma, indicating post-extinction colonization in low palaeolatitudes by medium- to large-bodied dinosaurs. Large-scale volcanism-induced stressors, potentially coupled with increased climate seasonality, likely created ecological opportunities facilitating dinosaur expansion in the earliest Jurassic.

 Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a dominant greenhouse gas and has a considerable effect on climate change. Satellite remote sensing is commonly used to acquire atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, the limited spatial coverage of a single satellite makes the obtainment of full-coverage CO2 data difficult. In this study, a daily dataset of global seamless column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) was generated with a high spatial resolution of 0.1° from 2016 to 2020, by using a stacking machine learning method. The proposed XCO2 dataset shows a satisfactory performance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.9697 ppm and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9868 in the 10-fold cross validation. The spatial validation reveals good generalization ability, with continent-by-continent validation results showing an R greater than 0.93. The proposed dataset reports high consistency and accuracy in the ground-based validation, with an RMSE of 1.0855 ppm. Out of 24 stations, 22 demonstrate a precision of R greater than 0.95. In comparison with two XCO2 model simulations, our reconstructions show a better consistency with ground observations. Spatial analyses at continent, national, and Chinese provincial levels, and temporal trends at daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual scales, are provided. Furthermore, benefitting from the daily temporal resolution, two typical examples of wildfire events, namely the Fort McMurray wildfire and the Blue Cut Fire, are evaluated. Our dataset can effectively capture fine-scale XCO2 variations and has the potential to characterize carbon sources and sinks.

 Urban vegetation, providing critical ecosystem services and supporting biodiversity, is essential for sustainable and resilient cities. Yet its semantic representation in urban digital twins and 3D city models remains inadequate for advanced modeling. Open data standards facilitate interoperable urban modeling. However, the CityGML standard, despite its widespread adoption, provides limited semantic depth for vegetation in its current Vegetation module, constraining dynamic and interdisciplinary applications.To address this, we present the international stakeholder survey evaluation alongside the updated version of the conceptual model of the CityGML 3.0 Vegetation Application Domain Extension (Vegetation ADE v1.1). The ADE enhances semantic richness by introducing extended attributes, feature types, enumerations, and code lists for both SolitaryVegetationObject and PlantCover, including structural components (crown, trunk, root) and dynamic properties via the CityGML Dynamizer module. Additionally, a vegetation management class is established.Refined through feedback from an international stakeholder survey, the model reflects practical requirements from domains including urban studies, ecology, and public administration. The core data modeling structure of ADE v1.0, unanimously supported by survey participants, was retained for ADE v1.1. The new version introduces substantial improvements: 15 attributes were modified, 12 added, and one removed. Nine code lists were revised and one added. Two enumerations were updated. These enhancements ensure ADE v1.1 achieves improved semantic clarity and usability, supporting diverse applications such as vegetation monitoring and adaptive green infrastructure management. This work demonstrates a replicable methodology for participatory standard development and advances the integration of vegetation into data-driven urban digital twins and 3D city models."

 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has become crucial for large-scale land subsidence monitoring, but its results represent complex superpositions of deformation signals from multiple compressible layers driven by various anthropogenic and natural factors. Decomposing subsidence patterns by different driving factors is vital for attribution and prediction. However, existing feature decomposition methods suffer from problems of incomplete decomposition and difficulties in direction determination. This study employs non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) assisted independent component analysis (ICA) to achieve feature decomposition and attribution of land subsidence in the Lubei Plain (LBP) from 2018 to 2023, and integration with deep learning to realize land subsidence prediction. Key contributions include: (1) Using NMF component directions as reference to determine three independent component directions for subsequent attribution and prediction analysis. (2) Groundwater wells in high-spatial-score regions were selected to analyze the relationship between ICs, deformation, and groundwater levels. IC1 showed a high correlation exceeding 0.8 with subsidence, reflecting near-linear patterns from deep confined aquifer over-exploitation and petroleum extraction. IC2 reached maximum correlations of 0.72 with subsidence and 0.56 with groundwater levels (GWL), reflecting inter-annual precipitation-driven variations. Similarly, IC3 exhibited maximum correlations of 0.63 and 0.71, respectively, characterizing seasonal cycles linked to agricultural irrigation and precipitation. (3) The proposed prediction model demonstrated excellent performance with RMSE of 0.06–0.69 and R2 of 0.80–0.86 in test datasets. This study provides a new reference perspective for future driving factor analysis and regulation of land subsidence in the Lubei Plain, and offers a new method for land subsidence prediction."

 Few-shot change detection in optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar images is a critical task for disaster monitoring. offering significant application value in complex scenarios with extremely limited labeled samples. However, the randomness of disasters causes a notable data distribution shift between public datasets and real disaster scenarios. With only a few annotated image pairs, existing methods struggle to effectively fuse features from heterogeneous images, leading to severe performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose a Dual-Stage Training framework for Change Detection (DSTCD), specifically designed for few-shot scenarios involving fewer than 20 labeled image pairs. DSTCD first undergoes source task pre-training on a heterogeneous image registration dataset. Subsequently, in the target task stage, it leverages task guided feature transfer module to transfer the structural and semantic features of image registration to the change detection task. This mechanism significantly enriches the feature representations under few-shot conditions, enabling accurate identification of affected areas. To validate its performance, we conducted comparative and ablation studies against eleven state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets covering both urban expansion and water expansion scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that DSTCD achieves a significant performance lead. Its average F1-score surpasses the second-best method by 6.98% in urban expansion scenarios and by 13.09% in water expansion scenarios, proving its superior performance and strong multi-scenario adaptability. Furthermore, robustness analysis of varying training sample sizes and real-world disaster application validation further confirm the method’s practicality and robustness for data-scarce disaster monitoring tasks. The code of the proposed method will be made available at https://github.com/Lucky-DW/DSTCD."

 Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D environment perception, as the sparsity and noise of LiDAR point clouds make it difficult to accurately recover both geometry and semantics. To address these challenges, we propose DPS2CNet, a novel Dual-Path SSC Network that integrates voxel-based and bird’s-eye view (BEV) representations to exploit their complementary strengths. Specifically, DPS2CNet employs a Cylinder3D-enhanced voxel branch to capture fine-grained 3D geometry and a UNet-based BEV branch to model large-scale contextual information. To further boost performance, we incorporate CARAFE for efficient feature upsampling and design a tailored loss function optimized for SSC. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 demonstrate that DPS2CNet achieves state-of-the-art results. In particular, it ranks first on the SemanticKITTI test set with an IoU of 62.6% among all open-source submissions1 , highlighting its effectiveness in complex real-world driving scenarios."

 Potential adverse effects of indoor air quality derived from the extensive and large-scale use of baby crawling and yoga mats have been increasingly recognized. However, the potentiality of chemicals released from these products under various placement orientation has yet to be adequately addressed. To fill this knowledge gap, baby crawling and yoga mats were selected to measure the emissions of hazardous chemicals from specific surfaces under various placement orientations. The results showed that placement directions had considerable impacts on the masses of emitted formamide, diisobutyl phthalate, benzothiazole, and p-bis(2-hydroxyisopropyl)benzene with vertical placement resulting in 1.1–3.3 times more masses than horizontal placement (p < 0.05). In comparison, the amounts of emitted chlorinated paraffins, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and di-(2-ethylhexyl)terephthalate were comparable between the vertical and horizontal placements (0.80–1.8 times). The increased amount of formamide derived from changing placement orientation (50–60 %; from horizontal to vertical) was greater than that from temperature-induced emission (10–20 %; from 25 °C to 35 °C). The mats with waterproof layer on surface were more effective in hindering formamide emissions compared to those with bossed patterns and untreated surfaces. When yoga mats were rolled up and placed vertically, the concentrations of chemicals emitted indoor were equivalent to or even greater than those emitted from horizontally placed mats during use, even though the exposed areas were reduced. The present study demonstrated that placement direction is a pivotal factor in regulating chemical emissions, with significant implications for improving indoor air quality."

 Stable nitrogen isotope analysis serves as a powerful tool for tracing the sources and transformation pathways of nitrogen-containing aerosols, which significantly influence atmospheric chemistry, climate change, and environmental processes. This review comprehensively synthesizes the application of stable nitrogen isotopes for the analysis of various forms of nitrogen in atmospheric aerosols, including ammonium, nitrate, and organic nitrogen, as well as atmospheric nitrous acid (HONO). We summarize key measurement techniques and analytical frameworks, with a particular emphasis on stable isotope mixing models-especially Bayesian methods-for source apportionment and the evaluation of isotope fractionation. The review delineates distinct stable nitrogen isotope signatures of major sources (e.g., fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, biomass burning) and elucidates the spatiotemporal variability of isotopic compositions driven by anthropogenic activities and natural processes. Despite advances in the stable isotope analysis of nitrogen-containing aerosols, several challenges remain, particularly concerning nitrogen isotope fractionation processes and the complexity of organic nitrogen species. Finally, we propose that future studies should refine the database of isotope characteristics from various sources, enhance the analytical precision of measurement techniques, and integrate multi-method approaches to better understand nitrogen cycles and mitigate the environmental impacts of nitrogen-containing aerosols."

 As key tropospheric parameters, zenith total delay (ZTD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) serve as core data supports for precise positioning of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), meteorological monitoring, and disaster early warning. However, existing observation and estimation methods generally suffer from technical bottlenecks, including insufficient spatiotemporal resolution, poor real-time performance, and data blind spots. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel retrieval method based on the Pangu-Weather system, aiming to achieve 7-day high-precision real-time forecasting of PWV and ZTD with 1 km resolution over the China. Using ERA5 reanalysis data as the initial field, the Pangu-Weather system is utilized to forecast meteorological parameters for the next 7 days, and preliminary PWV and ZTD products (Pangu-PWV, Pangu-ZTD) are obtained through integral calculation. Subsequently, based on GNSS data, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is employed to establish the mapping relationship between latitude, longitude, digital elevation model (DEM), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), time, and tropospheric parameters. The Pangu products are calibrated to the ground height, generating high-precision PWV and ZTD products with 1 km resolution (MLP-PWV, MLP-ZTD). Accuracy verification results indicate that the RMSE between MLP-PWV and GNSS-PWV is 3.63 mm, and the R2 is 0.95. For MLP-ZTD and GNSS-ZTD, the RMSE is 26.55 mm and the R2 is 0.99, both demonstrating excellent spatiotemporal consistency. Application analysis using typhoon Doksuri in 2023 as a case study shows that MLP-PWV can accurately depict the spatial distribution of PWV during hazardous weather processes, overcoming the limitation that Pangu-PWV is unable to reliably calculate PWV above the Earth's surface. This study provides reliable data support for real-time monitoring of tropospheric parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution."
