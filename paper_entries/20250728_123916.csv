By analyzing the distribution of Vp/Vs ratios, we found that seismic anomalies with values higher or lower than the average coincide with the boundaries of the earthquake ruptures. In contrast, the regions characterized by intermediate Vp/Vs values may represent a mechanical “sweet spot” where the physical properties create favorable conditions for sustained rupture propagation. Our methodology, which combines the Vp/Vs distribution and the analysis of coseismic slip models, could reveal the rupture‐prone regions and the likely magnitude of potential earthquakes, providing relevant information for seismic hazard assessment."
10.1029/2025GL114978,False,Geophysical Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注城市地区非平稳湍流的特征和机制，特别是在北京这样的特大城市。研究发现非平稳湍流在高稳定或高不稳定分层条件下更为常见，并会降低湍流输送效率。论文认为亚中尺度运动（如内重力波和对流环流）是造成非平稳湍流的主要原因，并提出了一种基于Hilbert-Huang变换的方法来降低非平稳性。虽然该研究与大气环境有关，但它更侧重于大气湍流的物理过程，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Turbulence', 'Non-stationarity', 'Urban areas', 'Flux estimation', 'Submeso motions', 'Internal gravity waves', 'Convective circulations']",Jiesheng Xue;Lu Zhang;Linlin Wang;Alexander Baklanov;Yuanjian Yang,Characteristics and Mechanisms of Non‐Stationary Turbulence in a Megacity Area,"Non‐stationarity challenges the applicability of turbulent similarity theory and flux estimation, especially in urban areas with highly heterogeneous underlying surfaces. Based on the observational data in Beijing, we investigated the characteristics and potential physical mechanisms of turbulent non‐stationarity in a megacity area. The results show that the proportion of non‐stationary turbulence in Beijing reached 52.41% in 2017. Strongly non‐stationary turbulence mainly occurs under strongly‐stable/strongly‐unstable stratification conditions. Strong non‐stationarity reduces the turbulent transport efficiency. This is characterized by the disintegration of turbulent coherent structures and the dominance of submeso motions. Furthermore, it was found that submeso motions (e.g., internal gravity waves and convective circulations) are the main cause of non‐stationary turbulence. After removing the influence of submeso motions based on the Hilbert‐Huang transform, the non‐stationary level is effectively reduced. The results are significant for accurately estimating turbulent fluxes and improving the parameterization of turbulent exchange processes in megacity areas."
10.1029/2025GL115270,False,Geophysical Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注全球平均表面温度（GMST）的变化，特别是2023-2024年创纪录的升温现象。论文旨在区分由人为因素引起的变暖和自然内部变率对GMST的影响，并使用统计学习方法来量化这两种因素的贡献。研究结果表明，2023年的GMST升高部分归因于自然变率，特别是厄尔尼诺南方涛动和北大西洋的影响。论文结论认为，没有足够的证据表明近年来人为变暖速率突然增加。因此，该论文的核心在于气候变化和统计分析，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接的强相关性。,[],G. Gyuleva;R. Knutti;S. Sippel,Combination of Internal Variability and Forced Response Reconciles Observed 2023–2024 Warming,"The record‐breaking global mean surface temperature (GMST) in 2023 and 2024 came as a surprise to the scientific community, raising the question whether it provides evidence for a recent abrupt increase in the forced global warming rate. Here, we provide a new statistical learning‐based method to quantify the forced and internal variability contributions to annual GMST based on CMIP6‐simulated surface temperatures, producing a variability‐adjusted GMST time series. We find a variability contribution to 2023 GMST of 0.1 K, with strong contributions from the El Niño Southern Oscillation region and North Atlantic. More than half of the 2022–2023 jump in temperature is explained by variability, largely owing to anomalously cool conditions in 2022. We find insufficient evidence of an abrupt increase in forced warming rate in recent years. Our results highlight the importance of variability originating outside the tropical Pacific and the need to filter out unforced variability when assessing changes in long‐term warming rates."

We assess how parameterized processes affect a model's cloud albedo and albedo symmetry using a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of atmospheric simulations. Parameters most significant to simulated albedo symmetry impact precipitation, turbulent dissipation, and sea salt aerosol emissions. Constraining the PPE's shortwave cloud feedbacks using the observed albedo symmetry yields a range of +0.61 ± $\pm $ 0.24 W m−2 K−1 (66% confidence), which is stronger than that of the model's control simulation due to parameter settings that lead to greater loss of subtropical low clouds and weaker negative cloud phase feedback. Although these settings would reduce cloud albedo bias compared to the control simulation, we find that albedo symmetry has limited potential as a constraint for cloud feedbacks on its own."

This unusual episode followed back‐to‐back upslope snowstorms and coincided with the presence of a deep stratospheric intrusion, but ground‐based lidar and ozonesonde measurements show that little, if any, of the O3‐rich lower stratospheric air reached the surface. Instead, the statically stable lower stratospheric air suppressed the growth of the daytime boundary layer and trapped nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by motor vehicles and oil and natural gas (O&NG) operations near the ground where the clear skies and extensive snow cover triggered a short‐lived photochemical episode similar to those observed in the O&NG producing basins of northeastern Utah and southwestern Wyoming. In this study, we use a combination of lidar, ozonesonde, and surface measurements, together with the WRF‐Chem and Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast models, to describe the stratospheric intrusion and characterize the boundary layer structure, HYSPLIT back trajectories to show the low‐level transport of O3 and its precursors to the exceedance sites, and surface measurements of NOx and VOCs together with a 0‐D box model to investigate the roles of urban and O&NG emissions and the COVID‐19 quarantine in the O3 production.

Kang,Enhanced shortwave absorption by water vapor increases effective climate sensitivity via accelerated AMOC recovery,"Enhanced shortwave absorption by water vapor increases effective climate sensitivity via accelerated AMOC recovery 
 Climate models exhibit substantial inter-model spread in climate sensitivity, typically attributed to uncertainty in cloud feedbacks. In contrast, the influence of clear-sky shortwave absorption (SWA) remains underexplored, despite its substantial uncertainty. Using a single-model framework, we systematically perturb SWA and impose CO₂ quadrupling on distinct mean states that differ in SWA, allowing assessment of its impact on both the mean climate and the CO₂-driven response. Enhanced SWA reduces surface shortwave radiation, leading to Arctic cooling. Under higher SWA, CO₂ forcing drives increased advection of colder Arctic air into the subpolar North Atlantic, enhancing turbulent heat loss and facilitating AMOC recovery. This accelerated recovery amplifies warming in the subpolar North Atlantic, strengthens lapse rate and shortwave cloud feedbacks, and ultimately increases climate sensitivity over time. These findings reveal a previously overlooked pathway by which clear-sky SWA modulates long-term climate feedback, underscoring the need to better constrain SWA in climate models."

 Remote detection of plastic litter in both marine and freshwater environments using satellite measurements has become a hot research topic in the past decade, where numerous papers have shown “successful” algorithm development and applications. However, many of these results appear to need some revisits because, in logic, the causality of A to B (i.e., A  => B) does not lead to the inference of B => A unless A is the only reason to cause B. In practice, even though plastics can lead to a certain type of signal anomaly (e.g., spectral, spatial, backscattering) from controlled experiments, the same anomaly detected from the natural environments cannot be used to infer plastics unless other possible reasons can all be ruled out. This is especially true when considering that non-plastic floating matters are much more ubiquitous in the aquatic environments. Unfortunately, this logic has been missing in many, if not most, publications. Here, using spectral reflectances of various types of floating matters and through demonstrations of several examples, I show why such logic is critical in remote detection of plastic litter and why pixel averaging and subtraction are necessary steps to spectrally discriminate the signal anomaly in multi-band optical remote sensing imagery. It is argued that unless other possibilities are ruled out using imaging spectroscopy or other means, it is premature to attribute the detected signal anomaly to plastic litter. After all, not every anomaly pixel is necessarily due to litter, and not every litter pixel is necessarily due to plastics unless proven otherwise."

 NOx plays a vital role in tropospheric ozone formation, OH radical recycling, and acts as a precursor to the formation of particulate nitrate (pNO3-), a major reactive nitrogen species. pNO3- mainly forms via four pathways: oxidation of NO2 by OH (P1), N2O5 hydrolysis (P2), reactions with VOCs (P3), and ClO (P4). However, studies on its sources and formation mechanisms are limited. This study uses dual isotopes (δ18O and δ15N) of pNO3- to explore the sources of NOx and dominant pNO3- formation pathways over Patiala, a semi-urban site in the northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), during a large-scale paddy residue burning. Day-time δ15N and δ18O averaged −5.0 ± 2.4 ‰ and 52.1 ± 6.2 ‰, while night-time values were −0.13 ± 5.7 ‰ and 60.0 ± 8.4 ‰, respectively, reflecting enhanced nighttime partitioning due to cooler temperatures. Further, P1 (79.6 ± 7.2 %) and P2 (16.1 ± 7.5 %) dominated pNO3- formation; P3 and P4 were negligible (<5 %). During the study period, the major sources of NOx were traffic exhaust (38 ± 18 %), biomass burning (29 ± 18 %), followed by emissions from coal-fired power plants (20 ± 11 %) and soil (13 ± 9 %). Our study, the first of its kind over India provide valuable insight into NOx transformation processes under specific seasonal and emission conditions. While these results improve the understanding of pNO3- formation and may aid in refining regional NOx inventories, they are representative of the particular location and time frame of sampling and may not reflect source contributions in other regions or during periods without episodic biomass burning influence."

 Several countries are working to reduce their anthropogenic CO2 emissions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. However, evaluation of the carbon reduction efforts is hindered by the larger uncertainties in the currently available datasets. Therefore, it is imperative to explore new efficient and reliable methods to estimate carbon emissions accurately. This study proposed a novel method to estimate global gridded anthropogenic CO2 emissions using satellite datasets. The methodology included the development and integration of two machine learning models, i.e., RXCO2 (Reconstruct XCO2) and REMI (Reconstruct EMIssion), to achieve the objective. RXCO2 utilized the CO2 products from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) model and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite to produce a daily global long-term regular gridded column-averaged dry-air model fraction of CO2 (XCO2) dataset with a spatial resolution of 1°. The predicted XCO2 dataset was thoroughly validated against the ground-based and satellite-derived XCO2 observations, and good consistency was observed among the datasets. Further, the XCO2 anomalies were derived using the predicted XCO2 dataset and were utilized in the second model (REMI) along with tropospheric NO2 column, nighttime light, and population density to predict annual gridded anthropogenic CO2 emissions at a spatial resolution of 1° for 2021 and 2022. The model achieved high accuracy with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 100.3 tons. The predicted results were comprehensively compared with the anthropogenic CO2 emissions provided by established inventories and good agreement was observed among the datasets."
