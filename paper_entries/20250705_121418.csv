While terrestrial biosphere models predict rising carbon sequestration in forests, direct observations of tree growth are inconclusive due to varying standardization procedures of tree-ring series and complex factors influencing stem growth such as moisture and nutrient deficits and anthropogenic carbon and nitrogen fertilization. The mismatch between tree-ring-based observations, repeated inventories at permanent plots, and predictions of biospheric models represents a significant knowledge gap limiting forecasting of future forest growth. Using the novel approach free of tree-ring standardization trials and focusing on even-aged trees sampled from uneven-aged forest stands, we present a robust comparison of tree stem diameter changes in temperate forests between 1990 and 2015 along environmental gradients in Central Europe. The stem sizes of four out of five species showed significant enlargement while also partly increasing stem growth limitation due to moisture availability. The largest increase in stem diameter was recorded for late succession species on fertile sites. By contrast, the stem size of early-succession species on dry and nutrient-poor sites remained unaltered. Stems of mature trees in present-day forests are, on average, 8% thicker than their counterparts in 1990 consistent with trends predicted by terrestrial biosphere models. We demonstrated that, despite increasing drought limitation, temperate tree species enlarged their stems. Viewed in conjunction with older permanent plot data, Central-European temperate forests exhibited almost half century of continuous stem enlargement, potentially impacting forest functioning in terms of size-sensitive characteristics such as susceptibility to drought and disturbances."

Insights from comparing the impacts of natural and artificial vegetation on hydrological processes,"It is widely acknowledged that vegetation change can exert considerable influences on the hydrological processes. Vegetation change can be either natural or artificial. However, the specific effects of natural growth (NG) and artificial restoration (AR) of vegetation on surface hydrology remain unclear. Using a recently developed ecohydrological model, we demonstrate that NG and AR have contrasting spatial impacts on hydrological components across China’s Yellow River Basin, a hotspot with intensive human-driven revegetation over the recent decades. Our analysis identifies a critical annual precipitation threshold of 300 mm, below which both NG and AR have marginal hydrological impact. In regions where precipitation exceeds this threshold, NG significantly reduces evapotranspiration and increases runoff, while AR has the opposite effects. These results suggest that NG is a more sustainable strategy in areas receiving less than 300 mm of annual precipitation, while AR may be appropriate for regions with precipitation higher than this threshold. Our findings offer valuable guidance for policymakers in designing sustainable revegetation strategies tailored to local environmental conditions."

However, the absence of high-quality data on crop yields at fine spatial resolutions in many regions of the world makes it challenging to statistically model their response to interannual variability in weather patterns. Therefore, there is a need for empirical methods that can project annual crop yield changes even in limited data regions. Here, we propose a transfer learning algorithm that uses high spatial resolution data from one region to project yields in another region with more limited data. The goal of our work is to understand what data types can be beneficial for transferring learning from a source region to a very different target region with more limited data. We utilize Long Short-Term Memory to develop a transfer learning model that is trained on historical county-level corn yield in the United States and predicts district-level corn yield variations in India. Even using smaller amounts of data in India, simulating a data-scarce region, we achieve an average root mean square error of 0.48 bu acre−1 in predicting interannual yield variations. Using Shapley values to interpret results, we explore the contribution of the different weather parameters to interannual yield variability and find a larger influence of precipitation-related variables. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of this method for transferring models of weather impacts on crop yields trained on a data-rich country to one with more limited data. It suggests the potential of applying the transfer learning model to mitigate the need for extensive raw data globally."

Through the synergetic integration of multi-temporal datasets encompassing landscape ecological risk (LER), ecosystem service value (ESV) and ecosystem stability sustainability (ESS), we formulate a novel three-dimensional analytical framework based on ‘pattern-service-stability’. This methodological advancement enables the quantification of dynamic ecosystem risk in the Poyang Lake Plain from 2000 to 2035 through multi-scenario simulation. The results reveal that (1) changes in forest, water and impervious land exhibit significant scenario dependence. The ecological protection (EP) scenario preserved higher forest–water proportions, while the urban growth (UG) scenario exhibited accelerated construction expansion, with the natural development scenario maintaining transitional states. (2) LER remains consistently low across periods, characterised by stability and minimal inter-scenario variations. The ESV shows a decreasing trend, with high ESV areas decreasing abruptly and becoming concentrated in Poyang Lake’s southern bay. The low ESV increases significantly in the UG scenario, while the EP scenario maintains a higher service capacity. The ESS displays pronounced spatial heterogeneity. Extreme values of ESS tend to be flat, while high-grade ESS dominates under the EP scenario. (3) The interaction among LER, ESV and ESS has significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity and policy sensitivity. The lakeshore is mostly characterised by ‘low LER-high ESS’, while near-lake zone is concentrated in ‘high LER-low ESS’, with the ESV in each zone mostly in an intermediate state. (4) The growth rate and spatial variation of the ecosystem risk index (ERI) were small during 2000–2023, but ERI was predicted to surge under the UG scenario. (5) The ecosystem risk evolution paths are different in each zone and roughly conform to a linear fit, with the lakeshore exhibiting accelerated risk escalation. The gravity centre of each risk early warning unit is located in Nanchang County. This spatially explicit diagnostic framework enables dynamic ecosystem risk early warning management and resilience enhancement."

The current study provides a critical analysis of literature on the application of green infrastructure (GI) and ecosystem-based technologies for CR. The review revealed regional disparities in implementation, technological applications, and scales of integration. Analysis conducted indicated that the United States, the United Kingdom and China are key pioneers in implementation; while developing nations, tropical and Mediterranean regions need more research and execution. Emergent findings showed that research on GI-CR achieved exponential growth in 2016, after the Paris Agreement. Further, built environment-scale CR considerations have accomplished significant developments. At the built environment-scale, the review systematically developed a five-stage implementation framework for GI-CR from grey infrastructure to broader systems, such as nature-based solutions and green cities. At the building-scale, the review revealed a weak linkage between CR and sustainability studies. The analysis therefore delineates the need to consider integrated CR systems that effectively incorporate mitigation and adaptation guidelines. Holistically, key directions provided include willingness to pay, the need for integrated sustainability and resilience systems, digital technologies application for indicator selection and effective monitoring. This study provides clear future research directions by highlighting existing knowledge gaps, scope considerations, geographic factors, and key areas for exploration within the realm of GI-CR."

The exploration of long-term nutrient trajectories for nitrogen model (ELEMeNT-N) has been applied to estimate legacy effects in several watersheds globally. However, ELEMeNT-N does not account for the accumulation-release processes of nitrate within soil profile, introducing potential uncertainty in long-term simulations. This study enhances ELEMeNT-N by incorporating a soil nitrate accumulation coefficient and a deep soil nitrate cycling module to better assess the long-term impact of legacy N on water quality. Long-term simulation for riverine N flux in the Yongan watershed, China (1980–2022) indicate that the modified model, ELEMeNT-N-SP, demonstrated significantly improved performance relative to the original model (Nash–Sutcliff coefficient: 0.89 vs 0.72, R2: 0.89 vs. 0.71). ELEMeNT-N-SP results indicate that ∼39.5% of N input accumulated in soil and groundwater, mainly in agricultural soil-groundwater. Legacy N contributed to 81.7% (Temporal: 65.6%–92.0%; i.e. cumulative contributions of historical N inputs) of riverine N flux (466 kg N ha−1). Among 12 modeling units, legacy N accumulation (SON: 175–1083 kg N ha−1; soil nitrate: −11–259 kg N ha−1; groundwater: 147–656 kg N ha−1) and its contribution to riverine N flux (Spatial: 64.0%–85.5%) showed considerable spatial heterogeneity. Agricultural soil-groundwater served as the primary accumulation sink for N input and the important source of riverine N pollution. Model validation, which included comparisons with monitored soil-groundwater N content and dual stable isotope data, confirmed the reliability of ELEMeNT-N-SP. ELEMeNT-N-SP offers a valuable framework for improving watershed nutrient management globally, emphasizing the importance of incorporating soil N cycling dynamics into predictive tools."

First, understanding the systemic interactions underlying sustainable development as envisioned in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is key. In the context of urban transport systems, this includes understanding what hinders or fosters reduced carbon emissions. Second, systemic knowledge must be coupled with a strong societal and political engagement. This study analyses whether citizen assessments of key SDG interactions in urban transport systems play a role in predicting individual transport mode choices. Normatively, changes in individually held systemic perspectives could encourage greater use of low-carbon transport modes in urban and peri-urban areas, which would be an essential step toward climate change mitigation. We use survey data (n = 822) to measure citizens’ perspectives on the urban transport system and their transportation habits in terms of car driving, cycling, or public transport. We use a Bayesian multilevel regression model to investigate ‘How do citizen assessments of SDG interactions influence transport mode choices?’. We find that negative citizen assessments of the influence of car-related (1) infrastructure and (2) transport affordability on reduced carbon emissions are associated with reduced frequency of car-driving. Conversely, we find that positive citizen assessments of the influence of (3) road safety for cyclists and (4) public transport affordability on reduced carbon emissions are associated with increased frequency of cycling and public transport use, respectively."

However, progress is hindered by several key challenges: (1) the need to quantify N2O emission reductions associated with BMPs, (2) an incomplete understanding of the behavioral factors influencing the adoption of BMPs, (3) the lack of suitable metrics to track progress towards reduction targets, and (4) an absence of region-specific management recommendations that balance emission reduction potential with farm profitability and farmer decision-making.

We analyze multidecadal trends and interannual variability in seasonal average FWI for the historical period and future projections under two emissions scenarios, and we compare MACA-CMIP5 ensemble results with a simple time series model that generates historical and future projections of seasonal FWI based on bootstrapping observed historical trends and variability. Our findings indicate that MACA-CMIP5 accurately captures the magnitude and spatial patterns of seasonally averaged FWI but tends to underestimate historical decadal trends. We show that future increases in fire risk may be underestimated relative to the simple time series model that projects historical variability into the future.

This study examines the behavior of ENSO using the Community Earth System Model version 2, in which a 400 year simulation was performed, following the SSP5-8.5 pathway, then gradually reducing CO2 emissions to net-zero with stabilization period. After reaching net-zero CO2 emissions, the state of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) is characterized by two different pathways, either fast warming or slow warming. We found that both El Niño and La Niña events have intensified during the North Atlantic fast warming period compared to that during the North Atlantic slow warming period. This is due to the strengthening of the La Niña-like mean state in the tropical Pacific under the rapid warming of the North Atlantic, which enhances the Ekman pumping feedback and zonal advective feedback. Therefore, this study suggests that in a net-zero CO2 emission environment, ENSO amplitude can either increase or decrease, but it is regulated by the North Atlantic SST state, implying that the inter-basin interactions should be considered to understand ENSO variability even after reaching net-zero emissions."

Stubenrauch;Giulio Mandorli,Relationship between latent and radiative heating fields of tropical cloud systems using synergistic satellite observations,"Strongly precipitating mesoscale convective systems produce a large amount of diabatic heating of the atmosphere, influencing atmospheric circulation. Their complete 3D description, attained by machine learning techniques in combination with satellite observations, has enabled a detailed study of the relationship between latent and radiative heating in these cloud systems. Convective organization increases both the average and the vertical gradient of radiative effects of the mesoscale convective systems. 
 In order to investigate the relationship between latent heating (LH) and radiative heating (Qrad), in particular the heating released by mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), we used synergistic satellite-derived data from active instruments. Given the sparse sampling of these observations, we expanded the spectral LH profiles derived from the Tropical Rain Measurement Mission (TRMM-SLH) by applying artificial neural network regressions to the Clouds from InfraRed Sounders (CIRS) data and meteorological reanalyses, following a similar approach as for the expansion of the Qrad profiles. A direct comparison with the collocated TRMM-SLH data shows excellent agreement of the average profiles, but the prediction range is underestimated, in particular between 550 and 900 hPa. Noise related to discrepancies in rain fraction between TRMM and CIRS-ML (machine learning), as well as an underestimation of extremes, can be reduced by averaging over larger areas. The zonal averages of vertically integrated LH (LP) at 01:30 and 13:30 LT align well with those from the full diurnal sampling of TRMM-SLH over the ocean. For upper-tropospheric (UT) clouds with a large amount of latent heat release, the surface temperature has a larger impact on the atmospheric cloud radiative effect (ACRE) in dry environments than in humid ones, while humidity plays a large role in cool rather than in warm environments. In all situations, the cloud height is mostly responsible for the value of ACRE. The distribution of UT clouds in the LP–ACRE plane shows a very large spread in the ACRE for small values of LP, which is gradually reduced towards larger values of LP. The mean ACRE of mature MCSs increases with LP, up to about 115 W m−2. As expected, the shapes of the LH profiles of mature MCSs show that larger, more organized MCSs have a larger contribution of stratiform rain than the smaller MCSs do. Furthermore, convective organization enhances the mean ACRE of mature MCSs on average by about 10 W m−2 over the whole LP range."

 The Tibetan Plateau significantly impacts regional and global climate systems due to its unique geographical location and complex environmental processes. This study investigates the variability and driving force of transboundary transport flux of carbon monoxide (CO) over the Tibetan Plateau from May 2018–April 2024. The CO fluxes were calculated with a closed-loop integral method using the TROPOMI, ERA5, and GEOS-CF data products. The results show that the external influx and internal efflux of CO over the Tibetan Plateau in each year are relatively close and have similar seasonal characteristics. High levels of CO flux occur in late autumn to winter, and low levels occur in summer. In most cases, CO flux maximizes in November, December, or January and minimizes in July or August.  The month-to-month variability during late autumn to winter is greater than that in summer. The Tibetan Plateau has experienced an increase of 2.86 Tg CO yr−1 in external influx, while the internal efflux has slightly decreased by -1.70TgCOyr-1. The magnitude of the increase in external influx in the southwestern segment is greater than in the northeastern segment. Conversely, the magnitude of the decrease in internal efflux in the northeastern segment is greater than in the southwestern segment.

The almost identical direction of the movements is beneficial for contrail lifetimes. 
 Contrails can last for many hours in the sky if they form in ice  supersaturated regions (ISSRs). Contrail formation is possible once the ambient air is sufficiently moist and cold (below −40 °C).  Contrails are persistent when the ambient relative humidity with respect to ice is at least 100 %. Cirrus clouds and contrails consist of  ice crystals, which move with the wind. Ice supersaturation is an immaterial feature, which does not generally move with the wind. However, the  movement of  ISSRs  relative to the winds is currently unknown. We analyse the movement of ISSRs and the wind using data for aviation weather forecasts, the WAWFOR package, from the German Weather Service (DWD). Our results demonstrate the  kinematic differences and similarities of the movement of ISSRs in comparison to the wind. We show that the ISSRs on average move slower than the wind at the same location, the direction of movement is usually quite similar and the distributions of both velocities follow Weibull distributions. The almost identical direction of the movements is beneficial for contrail lifetimes, but the lifetime of  contrails is not generally determined by the lifetime of ISSRs. Contrails are blown out of ISSRs with the wind. We assume that our study can be used as a basis  for further analyses  of the movement of ISSRs.  Furthermore, our method of analysis is applicable to other extended features or areas, for instance to areas where aircraft non-CO2 emissions would have a particularly large climate effect."

Using over 30 years of data from buoys around the world, we created a model that outperforms existing ones, especially under cloudy skies. Our results show that including detailed cloud information improves accuracy, making this method useful for global climate and ocean research. 
 The ocean-surface downward longwave radiation (Rl) is one of the most fundamental components of the radiative energy balance, and it has a remarkable influence on air–sea interactions. Because of various shortcomings and limits, a lot of empirical models have been established for ocean-surface Rl estimation for practical applications. In this paper, based on comprehensive measurements collected from 65 moored buoys distributed across global seas from 1988 to 2019, a new model for estimating the all-sky ocean-surface Rl at both hourly and daily scales was built. The ocean-surface Rl was formulated as a nonlinear function of the screen-level air temperature, relative humidity, cloud fraction, total column cloud liquid, and ice water. A comprehensive evaluation of this new model relative to eight existing models was conducted under clear-sky and all-sky conditions at daytime/nighttime hourly and daily scales. The validation results showed that the accuracy of the newly constructed model is superior to that of other models, yielding overall root mean square error (RMSE) values of 13.44 and 8.34 W m−2 under clear-sky conditions and 15.64 and 10.27 W m−2 under all-sky conditions at hourly and daily scales, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the effects of the total column cloud liquid and ice water on the ocean-surface Rl also need to be considered in addition to cloud cover. Overall, the newly developed model has strong potential to be widely used."

It is validated against lunar photometry, showing a strong correlation between data series. This innovative approach will expand nocturnal AOD measurements to more locations, as all-sky cameras are a simpler and more cost-effective alternative to stellar and lunar photometers. 
 The lack of aerosol optical depth (AOD) data at night can be partially addressed through Moon photometer measurements or fully covered with star photometer observations. However, the limited availability and complexity of star photometers have motivated this study to use all-sky cameras to extract starlight signals and derive AOD at night using star photometry. For this purpose, eight all-sky cameras were configured and deployed in nine different locations to capture raw images with varying exposure times every 2 min during the night. This work proposes a novel methodology to extract the starlight signal from the raw data from all-sky cameras and convert it into AOD values. This process consists of the following steps: removing the background image, selecting the pixels, and extracting the signal for each star from a predefined list of 56 stars; performing in situ Langley calibration of the instruments and retrieving the total optical depth (TOD); calculating the effective wavelength for each camera channel; deriving the AOD by subtracting the gas contribution to TOD; and averaging, cloud-screening, and quality-assuring the AOD time series. The AOD time series obtained through this methodology are compared with independent AOD measurements from collocated Moon photometers in the nine locations. The obtained results show that the AOD values derived with the proposed method generally correlate with reference values, often achieving correlation coefficients (r) above 0.90. The AOD values retrieved using the cameras tend to overestimate the reference values by approximately 0.02 and exhibit a precision of around 0.03–0.04. The agreement between the two datasets varies with wavelength and decreases at high-latitude locations, likely due to the poorer performance of Langley calibration in these regions. AOD values align well with day-to-night transitions obtained by solar photometers, demonstrating their reliability. Despite the slight overestimation, the AOD values derived by this new method approximate the real values and provide coverage throughout the entire night, without requiring the presence of the Moon. Therefore, they serve to study and monitor the nocturnal evolution of AOD."

Datasets describing this freshwater discharge have low resolution and do not cover the entire Arctic. We statistically enhanced coarse-resolution climate model data – from approximately 6 km to 250 m – and routed meltwater towards the coastlines to provide high-resolution data covering all Arctic regions. This approach has far fewer computational requirements than running climate models at high resolution. 
 Arctic air temperatures have increased approximately 4 times faster than the global average since about 1980. Consequently, the Greenland ice sheet has lost approximately twice as much ice as the Antarctic ice sheet between 2003 and 2019, and mass loss from glaciers and ice caps is also dominated by those that lie in the Arctic. Thus, Arctic land ice loss is currently a major contributor to global sea level rise. This increasing freshwater flux into the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans, will also affect physical, chemical and biological processes across a range of domains and spatiotemporal scales. To date, meltwater discharge data at Arctic coastlines are only available from two datasets that are limited by their spatial resolution and/or coverage. Here, we extend previous work and provide a high-resolution coastal meltwater discharge data product that covers all Arctic regions, where land ice is present, i.e. the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, Russian Arctic islands. Coastal meltwater discharge data – i.e. spatially integrated runoff that is assigned to the outflow points of drainage basins – were derived from Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) daily ice and land runoff products between 1950 and 2021, which we statistically downscaled from their original approximately 6 km resolution to 250 m. The complete data processing algorithm, including downscaling, is fully documented and relies on open-source software.

This aims to promote a comprehensive understanding of cloud dynamics and cloud–climate feedback. Closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) clouds occur more frequently at night, while suppressed cumulus clouds exhibit remarkable decreases. Solid stratus and MCC cloud types show clear seasonal variations. 
 Marine low clouds tend to organize into larger mesoscale patterns with distinct morphological appearances over the ocean, referred to as mesoscale morphology. While previous studies have mainly examined the fundamental characteristics and shortwave radiative effects of these mesoscale morphologies, their behaviour in the nighttime marine boundary layer (MBL) remains underexplored due to limited observations. To address this, we established a global classification dataset of daytime and nighttime marine low-cloud morphology using a deep residual network model and infrared radiance data of 1° × 1° resolution from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with machine-learning-retrieved all-day cloud optical thickness aiding in model training. We analysed day–night contrasts in climatology, seasonal cycles, and cloud properties of different cloud morphology types in this study. Results show that the relative frequency of occurrence of closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) increases significantly at night, while that of suppressed cumulus (Cu) shows a remarkable decrease. Disorganized MCC and clustered Cu display a slight frequency increase at night. In addition, solid stratus and three MCC types exhibit distinct seasonal variations, whereas two cumuliform types show no clear seasonal cycle. Our dataset extends the study of mesoscale cloud morphologies from daytime to nighttime, and the 1° × 1° resolution makes it a better match with other climate datasets. It will provide an important foundation for further research on the interactions between cloud morphology and climate processes.

Existing datasets, however, have low spatial resolutions or limited temporal coverage. This study introduces China's annual forest age dataset (CAFA), spanning 1986–2022 at a 30 m resolution. By tracking forest disturbances, we annually update ages. Validation shows small errors for disturbed forests and larger errors for undisturbed forests. CAFA can enhance carbon cycle modeling and forest management in China. 
 Forest age is crucial for both carbon cycle modeling and effective forest management. Remote sensing provides crucial data for large-scale forest age mapping, but existing products often suffer from a low spatial resolution (typically 1000 m), making them unsuitable for most forest stands in China, which are generally smaller than this threshold. Recent studies have generated static forest age products for 2019 (CAFA V1.0) (Shang et al., 2023a) and 2020 (Cheng et al., 2024) at a 30 m spatial resolution. However, their low temporal resolution limits their applicability to track multiyear forest carbon changes. This study aims to generate China's annual forest age dataset (CAFA V2.0) at a 30 m resolution from 1986 to 2022, utilizing forest disturbance monitoring and machine learning techniques. Forest disturbance monitoring, which typically has lower uncertainty compared to machine learning approaches, is primarily employed to update annual forest age. The modified COLD (mCOLD) algorithm, which incorporates spatial information and bidirectional monitoring, was used for forest disturbance monitoring. For undisturbed forests, forest age was estimated using machine learning models trained separately for different regions and forest cover types, with inputs including forest height, vegetation indices, climate, terrain, and soil data. Additionally, adjustments were made for underestimations in the Northeastern and Southwestern regions of China identified in CAFA V1.0 using additional reference age samples and region-specific and forest-type-specific models. Validation, using a randomly selected 30 % of two reference datasets, indicated that the mapped age of disturbed forest exhibited a small error of ±2.48 years, while the mapped age of undisturbed forest from 1986 to 2022 had a larger error of ±7.91 years. The generated 30 m annual forest age dataset can facilitate forest carbon cycle modeling in China, offering valuable insights for national forest management practices. The CAFA V2.0 dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24464170 (Shang et al., 2023b)."

Most gas levels increased and were higher than at two other Antarctic stations. Their sources were linked to industrial activities such as refrigeration and electronics. Although limited to one year, the data provide important background information for detecting future changes in the Antarctic atmosphere. 
 As potent greenhouse gases with high global warming potentials, fluorinated gases (F-gases) have emerged as significant contributors to global radiative forcing. Owing to minimal anthropogenic influences, Antarctica provides an exceptional natural environment for investigating background atmospheric F-gas concentrations. This study presents the first comprehensive report of temporal variations in 11 F-gas species at the Zhongshan National Atmospheric Background Station (ZOS; 69.4° S, 76.4° E) throughout 2021. This study is the first to provide concentration changes of 11 F-gases at ZOS in Antarctica in 2021. The datasets are publicly available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center at https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.302283 (Tian et al., 2025). The concentrations of most F-gases significantly increased throughout 2021 at ZOS. The concentrations of F-gases in East Antarctica were greater than those in the Antarctic Peninsula and the interior on the basis of data comparisons with three other Antarctic stations. Back trajectory and clustering analyses using the HYSPLIT model revealed that the contributions of different trajectory clusters were nearly identical at each station. Source apportionment analysis via the PMF model identified industrial processes, refrigeration, fire suppression, and electronics as key contributors to F-gas concentrations in the Antarctic atmosphere. While the one-year observation period precludes long-term trend assessment, these high-frequency measurements capture the baseline variability critical for detecting future anomalies. Continuous multiyear monitoring at ZOS is necessary to establish statistically robust growth rates."

Traditional models struggle with accurately simulating burned areas due to simplified processes. By combining the predictive power of machine learning with a land model, our hybrid framework better captures fire dynamics. This approach enhances our understanding of wildfire behavior and aids in developing more effective climate and fire management strategies. 
 Wildfires have shown increasing trends in both frequency and severity across the contiguous United States (CONUS). However, process-based fire models have difficulties in accurately simulating the burned area over the CONUS due to a simplification of the physical process and cannot capture the interplay among fire, ignition, climate, and human activities. The deficiency of burned area simulation deteriorates the description of fire impact on energy balance, water budget, and carbon fluxes in the Earth system models (ESMs). Alternatively, fire models based on machine learning (ML), which capture statistical relationships between the burned area and environmental factors, have shown promising burned area predictions and corresponding fire impact simulation. We develop a hybrid framework (ELM2.1-XGBFire1.0) that integrates an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) wildfire model with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM) version 2.1. A Fortran–C–Python deep learning bridge is adapted to support online communication between ELM and the ML fire model. Specifically, the burned area predicted by the ML-based wildfire model is directly passed to ELM to adjust the carbon pool and vegetation dynamics after disturbance, which are then used as predictors in the ML-based fire model in the next time step. Evaluated against the historical burned area from Global Fire Emissions Database 5 from 2001–2019, the ELM2.1-XGBFire1.0 outperforms process-based fire models in terms of spatial distribution and seasonal variations. The ELM2.1-XGBFire1.0 has proven to be a new tool for studying vegetation–fire interactions and, more importantly, enables seamless exploration of climate–fire feedback, working as an active component of E3SM."

Here, we conducted long-term field measurements in Beijing during the winter, including Phase I (2015–2017) and Phase II (2018–2021). Our results showed that HMS concentrations decreased significantly in Phase I, consistent with changes in PM2.5, organic matter (OM), and sulfate, and showed an increasing trend in Phase II in contrast to the decreasing trend of PM2.5, OM, and sulfate. In addition, HMS contributions to PM2.5, OM, and particulate sulfur increased significantly during Phase II. HMS contributed up to 6% of PM2.5 and 24% of OM during heavy pollution periods in 2019. Despite the continuous reduction in gaseous precursors, the changes in aerosol water content driven by relative humidity and total chemical composition concentrations were the main factors influencing the interannual changes in HMS concentrations from 2015 to 2021 winter.

Sucralose was predominately sourced from treated wastewater; measurable concentrations in tributaries indicated raw sewage inputs. DPG and 6PPD-Q concentrations correlated to road density during base flow and were elevated during stormflow. AMPA was measurable spring through fall, especially where lawns were dense. When specific sources dominated flow, water quality measures correlated with wastewater (sulfate, potassium, chloride, and sodium) and road runoff (chromium and lead) indicators. The limited behavioral toxicity observed in exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) (18%) was not well explained by source-indicators.

Comparative analysis indicated that ionic FBs were primarily excreted in urine, while nonionic FBs exhibited higher detection frequencies and concentrations in breast milk compared to urine. Multivariate analysis revealed that greater consumption of convenience foods and bottled water was associated with increased nonionic FB exposure, whereas higher use of personal care products predicted greater ionic FB exposure. Exposure assessment identified breastfeeding as a significant pathway for infant FB exposure.

However, conventional SDIE systems have struggled to enhance evaporation efficiency while mitigating salt scaling. Here, we introduce an innovative 3D-printed photothermal stainless steel SDIE system designed to address these limitations. By leveraging the high thermal conductivity of stainless steel, our design creates a strategic temperature differential across the SDIE, maximizing energy harvesting from solar radiation, ambient air, and feedwater. The unique edge-protruding structure facilitates localized salt crystallization and autonomous detachment, achieving effective salt self-collection. Numerical simulations reveal that Marangoni convection drives liquid flow toward the edge for the controlled salt crystallization. Under one sun radiation, our system achieves a remarkable evaporation rate of 3.18 kg m–2 h–1 and a salt collection rate of 1.57 kg m–2 h–1 with highly concentrated brine (25 wt % NaCl solution). Outdoor and real brine tests validated its capability for zero liquid discharge desalination, demonstrating both enhanced desalination efficiency and sustainable brine management through simultaneous water recovery and salt collection. This study offers a new strategy for designing highly efficient SDIE systems, addressing the challenges of sustainable desalination and paving the way for future advancements in water treatment technologies."

Previous research has focused on vegetative wildfires with nothing known about DBPs from wildland-urban interface wildfires. In this study, the water-extractable fraction of seven structural ashes and two vegetation ashes from the 2020 LNU Lightning Complex Fire in California were treated with chlorine and chloramine. Formation of 65 DBPs from seven different classes was measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Chlorination of the water-soluble fraction of structural ashes caused formation of higher levels of brominated, iodinated, and nitrogenous DBPs than the vegetation ashes due to structural ashes containing greater levels of water-soluble bromide and iodide. Chloramination reduced total DBP formation and calculated cytotoxicity vs chlorination, except in two structural ashes where iodinated and nitrogenous DBP formation was high. Structural ash leachates had lower dissolved organic carbon levels than vegetation ash and contribute lower levels of DBP precursors. However, these precursors may increase the toxicity of drinking water due to a shift toward more toxic DBP species."

This study presents the first systematic investigation linking sediment dredging to long-term carbon sequestration dynamics in river ecosystems, addressing critical uncertainties in anthropogenic impacts on aquatic carbon balance. Over a three-year period, dredging significantly altered CO2 flux (fCO2) and dissolved CO2 partial pressure (pCO2), with pronounced seasonal variability driven by dissolved organic carbon as a key predictor. Microbial community composition shifted from Cyanobacteria to Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria dominance, accompanied by enhanced Calvin cycle enzyme gene expression and suppression of alternative carbon fixation pathways. While phytoplankton biomass, particularly Cyanobacteria, declined sharply during dredging, carbon sequestration potential exceeded predredging levels within three years of monitoring, indicating strong resilience in riverine carbon storage capacity. Our findings indicate that (1) dredging-induced community restructuring enhances chemoautotrophic carbon fixation through modified expression of rTCA cycle components and Calvin cycle optimization, (2) phytoplankton carbon biomass and chlorophyll a emerge as primary drivers of postdredging carbon sequestration pathways, and (3) gross primary production peaks at 960.8 mg C m–2 d–1 through synergistic phytoplankton interactions.

The concentration of aerosol soluble proteins (ASPs) during dust periods averaged 0.88 ± 0.41 μg m–3, 2.6 times higher than during non-dust periods, and showed a strong correlation with dust concentration. Non-viable particle-attached bacteria increased by 225%, constituting the dominant fraction in dust air.

While significant progress has been made in reducing anthropogenic emissions in China, surface ozone levels continue to rise, emphasizing the growing importance of biogenic emissions in air quality management. Despite the availability of various biogenic emission models, including MEGAN v3.2 and BEIS v3.6 for BVOCs and YL95 and BDSNP for soil NO, discrepancies in their estimates introduce uncertainties in understanding their combined impacts on ozone formation. Existing studies largely focus on individual contributions of BVOCs or soil NOx, leaving their synergistic effects underexplored in China. Here, we evaluate the individual and combined impacts of BVOC and soil NOx emissions on ozone formation in China using the MEGAN and BEIS models integrated with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Nine sensitivity scenarios were simulated to examine spatial and temporal variations in emissions and their contributions to ozone. Results indicate that MEGAN estimates 1.27 times higher BVOC emissions than BEIS, particularly for isoprene and monoterpenes, while the BDSNP scheme predicts higher soil NO emissions compared to YL95. Combined emissions result in ozone and SOA increases of 10.11%–28.40% and 15.03%–62% across China, with significant regional variability. Synergistic effects amplify ozone formation beyond the additive impacts of individual emission sources, particularly in regions like the North China Plain. Our findings underscore the critical need to incorporate detailed biogenic emissions in air quality models to accurately capture ozone dynamics in China. By identifying the significant contributions of BVOCs and soil NOx, this study provides a robust basis for developing refined emission control strategies. The insights gained advance the broader understanding of natural and anthropogenic interactions in atmospheric chemistry, guiding policy interventions to mitigate ozone pollution effectively."

The gas-phase oxidation mechanism of γ-terpinene is essential for understanding its influence on atmospheric chemistry and its implications for human health. Utilizing quantum chemical calculations and computational toxicology simulations, we examined the •OH-mediated atmospheric transformation and toxicological progression of γ-terpinene in the indoor environment. The results indicate that •OH additions are the dominant pathways for the reaction of •OH + γ-terpinene. The most favorable reactive intermediates formed from the •OH-addition reactions subsequently react with O2 to form hydroxy γ-terpinene peroxy radicals (OH-γ-terp-RO2•). The formed OH-γ-terp-RO2• follows concerted peroxy radical (RO2•) and alkoxy radical (RO•) modulated autoxidation, providing a new case for such a mechanism beyond the well-known only RO2-driven autoxidation mechanism. Our findings also reveal that the transformation of OH-γ-terp-RO2• demonstrates the competitive nature of the cyclization pathway indoors, with dicarbonyl formation, a rarely observed process in hydroxy terpene RO2 reaction systems. Toxicological evaluations further indicate that a significant proportion of transformation products (TPs) display higher mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, skin sensitization, and irritation to eyes compared to γ-terpinene.

Vargas Zeppetello;Jonathan Proctor;Peter Huybers,Is Water Stress the Root Cause of the Observed Nonlinear Relationship Between Yield Losses and Temperature?,"Observational analyses consistently find that yields of major rainfed crops increase with temperature up to a threshold of approximately 32° ${}^{\circ}$C, above which they reduce sharply. Two damage pathways have been suggested to explain this relationship: that high temperatures directly stress crops and drive yield loss, or that high temperatures induce water stress in crops, which in turn drives yield loss. Here we explore a third pathway: that soil water stress limits both agricultural productivity and evaporative cooling, giving rise to the nonlinear relationship between temperature and yield. Determining which of these pathways underpins the yield‐temperature relationship is important for predicting future crop productivity because climate change is expected to alter the co‐variability between temperature and water availability. To examine this third pathway, we use cumulative growing‐season transpiration from an idealized land surface model as a proxy for yield. This approach reproduces the observed yield‐temperature relationship, even though the model includes no mechanisms that limit productivity at high temperatures. In experiments where the influence of temperature on soil moisture is suppressed, yields still decline during hot, dry periods in a manner consistent with the observations. We conclude that water stress, and its influence on evaporative cooling, temperature, and agricultural productivity, drives the yield‐temperature relationship found in crops that experience episodic water stress. This framework explains the muted sensitivity of irrigated yields to high atmospheric temperatures, and suggests that future yield outcomes depend more critically on changes in rainfall than suggested by estimates that attribute yield losses primarily to temperature variations."

The results show that non‐positive PS may misrepresent dependency of synchronous droughts, and such instances are widespread in MC (60.4%). Based on dependent droughts, network coefficients derived from the framework indicate that high values of positive PS are predominantly distributed in the humid‐arid transition zones.

Despite significant reductions in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in China due to air pollution control measures, ozone (O3) pollution has worsened in recent years, with pronounced regional disparities in long‐term exposure to O3 and NO2. Assessing these disparities in exposure to gaseous pollutants and the resulting unequal health risks between urban and rural regions has become increasingly essential. The contributions of various anthropogenic emissions to O3 and NO2 were quantified using a source‐oriented version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, combined with population and GDP data sets. From 2010 to 2019, NOx and VOC emissions from non‐urban areas decreased by 14% and 25%, respectively, whereas urban anthropogenic activities caused a 10% increase in NOx emissions and a 22% rise in VOC emissions. The simulations indicated that background levels constituted the majority of maximum daily 8‐hr average O3 (MDA8 O3), contributing 83% in 2010 and 75% in 2019. Non‐urban anthropogenic activities were the primary sources of NO2, accounting for 64% in 2010 and 57% in 2019. The proportion of O3 and NO2 from urban anthropogenic emissions in the total concentration continuously increased between 2010 and 2019. Although overall O3‐related premature mortality increased by 51% and NO2‐related premature mortality decreased by 3% during this period, the number of premature mortalities related to O3 and NO2 from urban anthropogenic activities rose by 133% and 15% respectively.

However, the impact of climate change on the carbon cycle remains unclear. Here, we assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in China's terrestrial ecosystems from 2010 to 2020 and its response to climate change using the regional climate‐chemistry‐ecology coupled model RegCM‐Chem‐YIBs. The estimations demonstrate that the national annual average NEP was 399.08 TgC yr−1 and increased by 8.83 TgC yr−1, effectively offsetting 15.4% of industrial carbon emissions. The NEP decreased gradually from southeast to northwest, with the maximum occurring in the southwest (122.31 TgC yr−1); the NEP intensity peaked in summer (102.31 gC m−2 yr−1). Climate change positively contributed to NEP (11.2 TgC yr−1), with significant interannual and regional differences. Precipitation anomalies in the southern region are the main meteorological factor for the interannual fluctuation of NEP. The increase in radiation led to an increase in NEP of 4.85 TgC yr−1 and dominated 46.49% of the region in China. The increase in NEP in the southern region was attributed to enhanced radiation, while the northern region benefited from increased precipitation and rising temperatures. These findings highlight the significant spatiotemporal variations in the impact of climate change on the carbon sinks of terrestrial ecosystems in China. It is essential to account for the effects of climate change and to adopt differentiated strategies to enhance carbon sinks during policy formulation."

Long‐term data sets from Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations and Air Quality Monitoring Stations were used to develop a photochemical metric based on volatile organic compounds ratios. We analyzed the ratio of ln(n‐butane/ethane) versus ln(n‐pentane/ethane) based on which we derived the δ value to assess the degree of regional air mass aging from a chemical reactivity perspective. In summer, extreme ozone events with low δ values are primarily driven by local photochemical activity. However, in fall and spring, the slightly higher δ values in some episodes signify the involvement of long‐range transport (LRT) bringing in continental ozone and cooler air masses while local photochemistry remains active. The interaction between transported and locally produced ozone is pronounced during milder ozone episodes (100–120 ppbv). We further examined the m,p‐xylene/ethylbenzene ratio as a complementary chemical indicator for characterizing ozone events with mild LRT. Slightly lower temperatures (below 28.8°C) are often accompanied by elevated nocturnal ozone levels (40–80 ppbv) and a less defined m,p‐xylene/ethylbenzene ratio. Overall, high‐ozone episodes (≥100 ppbv) are primarily driven by local photochemical processes. However, LRT can elevate the ozone baseline, particularly during spring and fall, when aged air masses bring in residual ozone leading to increased daytime ozone levels. These findings highlight how local photochemistry and regional transport shape high‐ozone episodes emphasizing the value of chemical indicators for understanding air mass aging and ozone formation."

We analyzed temperature and precipitation responses for 2050–2069 relative to 2015–2034 under SSP2‐4.5 and ARISE‐SAI‐1.5 scenarios. Our approach involved evaluating temperature and precipitation anomalies, applying signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) analysis—defined as the ratio of the forced climate response to internal variability—to assess signal robustness, and using cumulative distribution (CDF) and probability density (PDF) functions to explore shifts in precipitation extremes. Results indicate that under SSP2‐4.5, both models project significant warming. UKESM1 simulates increases near 1.8°C, while CESM2 projects between 1.0°C and 1.2°C. Under ARISE‐SAI‐1.5, UKESM1 shows pronounced cooling, with temperatures dropping up to 0.3°C below the reference period at some latitudes. CESM2 shows a more uniform cooling, with temperatures between 0°C and 0.3°C above the reference. SNR analysis reveals robust, statistically significant temperature changes across the region, clearly emerging above natural variability by midcentury. Precipitation changes, however, show lower SNR values and greater spatial uncertainty, suggesting weaker and less predictable hydrological responses. CDF and PDF analyses highlight complex shifts in precipitation extremes, suggesting that while SAI could counteract warming trends, it may introduce additional variability and uncertainty in rainfall projections. These results emphasize the importance of multimodel comparisons in assessing geoengineering impacts on regional climates, as differing sensitivities to radiative forcing and feedback can produce divergent outcomes."

Previous studies are mostly concerned with trends of seasonal frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation and interpret those trends based on long‐term changes in seasonal mean moisture. Present study analyzes trends of extreme precipitation frequency in sub‐periods of the rainy season (June and July) in central eastern China and roles of atmospheric circulation changes. It is found that the trends of extreme precipitation frequency have prominent subseasonal changes in central eastern China. The frequency of extreme precipitation displays an increasing trend in early June and early and middle July, but a decreasing trend in middle and late June and late July. The trends of extreme precipitation frequency are attributed to those of corresponding atmospheric circulation patterns in sub‐periods of the rainy season. Increasing (decreasing) trends of extreme precipitation frequency are associated with increasing (decreasing) lower‐level southwesterly winds over southeastern China, westward extending (eastward retreating) western North Pacific subtropical high and strengthening (weakening) East Asian trough. The mean atmospheric circulation trends play a role in the subseasonal changes in the trends of extreme precipitation frequency in central eastern China. The change in the mean moisture availability cannot explain subseasonal changes in the trends of extreme precipitation frequency. Present study suggests the necessity of analyzing extreme precipitation trends and roles of atmospheric circulation trends during sub‐periods of seasons."

Apart from photochemical reactions, stratospheric intrusion (SI) also contributes to tropospheric O3 pollution. In this study, a strong SI event that greatly influenced the near‐surface O3 pollution was identified in May 2023. To quantitatively analyze the contribution to surface O3 over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), meteorological reanalysis data, in situ observations, and a regional meteorology‐chemistry coupled model were integrated. Our findings reveal that the severe O3 pollution observed over the YRD region cannot be solely attributed to photochemical processes. Noteworthily, a distinct signal of stratospheric air masses injecting into the troposphere was observed, indicating a more complex interplay between atmospheric chemical and physical processes. The clustering analysis of the backward trajectories shows that the O3‐rich air masses injected into the lower troposphere are primarily driven by westerly jets and downwelling behind the troughs accompanying the low‐pressure weather system at 46°N–60°N. The stratospheric O3‐rich air masses can be transported to the YRD region driven by the strong downwelling occurring with a high‐altitude wind field toward the south. Using the regional meteorology‐chemistry model Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF‐Chem) with real‐time input of the upper chemical boundary conditions, it is estimated that such regionally transported SI O3 contributed more than 12 ppb to surface O3 pollution over the YRD region."

Yet the apparent relationship between low‐cloud fraction and shallow convective mixing differs substantially among general circulation models (GCMs), large eddy simulations, and both remote sensing and in situ observations. Here, we consider how changes in GCMs' representations of subgrid‐scale vertical moist fluxes can alter the cloud‐mixing relationship. Using vertical profiles of water vapor isotope ratios (δD) to characterize the strength of shallow convective mixing in a manner that can be compared directly to satellite observations, we evaluate the cloud‐mixing relationship produced in tiered experiments with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). From versions 5 to 6 of CAM, the most notable physics change is CLUBB, a scheme that unifies the representation of shallow convection and boundary layer turbulence through a joint probability density function (PDF) for subgrid velocity and moisture. CLUBB reduces the covariance between low‐cloud fraction and shallow convective mixing, producing a bivariate distribution that is more similar in character to monthly averaged satellite observations. Using parameter sensitivity experiments, we argue that CLUBB's ability to simulate skewness in the distribution of vertical velocity produces more isolated but stronger moist updrafts, which reduce the grid‐mean low‐cloud fraction while maintaining efficient hydrological connectivity between the boundary layer and the free troposphere. These results suggest that mixing is not an effective predictor of low‐cloud feedback in GCMs with PDF closure schemes."

Our analysis shows that the cumulative intensity and duration of global temperature extremes has increased by an average of 36% from 1990 to 2020 and is projected to rise by 52% over the next 30 years. The Global South, inhabited by 10% of the world's elderly (aged 69+), bears 53% of the EMRI during the 60‐year period.

This problem is especially pronounced for semi‐arid regions with large amounts of irrigated agriculture, such as California's Central Valley. In this region, increased ETo has increased irrigation demand, but the role of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) in driving this increase has not yet been quantified. Here, we quantified the influence of ACC on ETo and how these changes have translated into increased irrigation demand. We calculated observational ETo from ERA5‐Land and counterfactual ETo that removes the forced changes simulated by 20 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 from the observational records. At the scale of North America, we found that ACC drove a 64 mm increase in annual ETo from 1980 to 2022, compared to the observed 54 mm increase. The largest observed increases in ETo were found in the southwestern and central regions, where ACC has likely exacerbated trends linked to natural climate variability. The largest ACC contributor to increased ETo was increased vapor pressure deficit, while decreased solar radiation has tempered increased ETo. Finally, we found that ACC has increased annual crop irrigation demand in the Central Valley by 0.76 km3 during 1980–2022, with cumulative increased irrigation demand of 9.2 km3, equivalent to ∼11% of the region's groundwater loss during this time.

Here, authors demonstrate fast temporal anti-lasing that achieves coherent perfect absorption over ultrashort timescales by using topological transitions in hysteretic scattering systems. 
 Coherent perfect absorption (CPA), or anti-lasing, has been so far inherently restricted to continuous wave scenarios, drastically restricting its applications to standard linear steady-state systems. However, future technologies based on enhanced light-matter interactions typically require the dynamic emission and absorption of pulses, as in ultrafast optics, frequency-comb technologies, or spiking neuromorphic networks. Here, we propose to extend the reach of anti-lasing to pulsed operation. We unveil the phenomenon of fast temporal anti-lasing, in which perfect absorption of photons occurs transiently over ultrashort time scales, creating fast absorption pulses associated with broadband absorption frequency combs. This is obtained by leveraging robust topological transitions occurring in a hysteretic scattering system, which is temporally modulated to loop near a CPA singularity. Our work evidences the interplay between intrinsic memory and topology in wave scattering, unveiling the rich physics of Floquet engineering through topological switching. We envision applications in spiking photonic networks with robust emission, routing and detection of spikes, which may form the basis for future analog neuromorphic hardware.

 Aortopathy including Marfan (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) poses a high risk of aortic dissection, particularly during pregnancy and the puerperium. Current preventive measures of aortic root dilatation include medical therapy and prophylactic aortic root replacement. The Personalised External Aortic Root Support (PEARS) operation has been developed as an alternative surgical strategy to prevent aortic root dilatation and is now an established procedure with a good prognosis. However, outcomes in pregnant women are unknown. We present case series of nine successful pregnancies in seven women with aortopathy (6 MFS and 1 LDS) who underwent PEARS procedure prior to conception. At a mean follow-up of 4.3 years after delivery, there was no type A or B aortic dissections. Aortic dimensions remained stable, and no hypertensive disorders were observed. Although this is a small retrospective study, PEARS procedure may be a viable pre-conception surgical strategy for women with aortopathy, as an alternative to conventional aortic root surgery. Further studies are needed to conclude that PEARS could be a non-inferior or superior alternative to conventional aortic root surgery in these patients.

Here, the authors generalize these theories to Dirac systems accommodating gapless initial states. 
 The conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism and the finite-time scaling provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics from gapped initial states based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario. Here we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the quantum critical point triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order parameter bosons. We find that despite the existence of the gapless initial phase, the driven dynamics can still be captured by the finite-time scaling form. This leads us to propose a criterion for the validity of Kibble-Zurek mechanism with a gapless initial state. Accordingly, our results generalize the Kibble-Zurek theory to incorporate composite fluctuations and relax its requirement for a gapped initial state to systems accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitations. Our work not only brings fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides an approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.

 Eating disorders arise from a complex interaction of genetic and environmental influences. Here we provide comprehensive population-level estimates of the heritability of eating disorders and their genetic relationships with various mental health and cardiometabolic disorders (CMDs), expanding beyond genome-wide association studies. We examined the heritability of three eating disorders—anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and other eating disorders (OED)—and investigated shared familial and genetic risk factors with mental health disorders and CMDs. Using national register data from Denmark and Sweden (1972–2016), we analysed clinical diagnoses for over 67,000 individuals with eating disorders, their first-degree relatives, and matched controls from populations totalling 17 million. Heritability estimates were moderate, h2AN = 36%, h2BN = 39%, and h2OED = 30% and genetic correlations revealed substantial overlap between AN and obsessive-compulsive disorder (rg = 0.65) and moderate correlations with other mental health disorders such as autism (rg = 0.36). Significant genetic associations were also identified between eating disorders and CMDs, showing strong replication across both countries.

 Hyperbolic polaritons have drawn great attention in nanoscale light manipulation due to their unique properties. Currently, most studies focus on natural hyperbolic phonon materials in the mid-infrared, limiting their application in the visible to near-infrared range. Here, we present a work on broadband near-infrared hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in a van der Waals material MoOCl2 by a perturbation-free direct imaging technique of photoemission electron microscopy. In particular, the hyperbolic polariton behavior has been dynamically tailored and manipulated by wavelength, polarization, interlayer twist, and artificial structure, providing a reconfigurable platform for nanophotonic applications. Notably, the full iso-frequency contours can be reconstructed via polarization-selective excitations. Our work has contributed to hyperbolic materials in the broadband near-infrared with MoOCl2, and has revealed PEEM to be an ideal method for studying hyperbolic plasmon polaritons at the space-time limit.

 Surface meltwater is predicted to become increasingly important for Antarctic mass loss as atmospheric temperatures rise, due to its potential to influence ice dynamic, hydrofracture and radiative processes. However, our understanding of Antarctic surface meltwater is limited, with previous studies restricted in spatial or temporal scope. Here, using cloud computing, we produce an Antarctic-wide, monthly dataset of surface meltwater for 2006 to 2021. Surface meltwater covered 3,732 km2 across Antarctica on average during each melt season, with 30% on grounded ice. High interannual variability in meltwater area across the Antarctic Peninsula and in East Antarctica correlates with large-scale modes of climate variability. In west Antarctica, meltwater area is comparatively low and this correlation is absent. An increase in the magnitude and variability of surface meltwater area without a coincident increase in modelled snowmelt in East Antarctica indicates that the ice-sheet surface might be becoming more favourable to meltwater ponding.

 Surface meltwater production influences the contribution of ice sheets to global sea-level change. Ice-sheet-wide meltwater production has thus far primarily been quantified by regional climate models. Here we present a 31-year (1992–2023) time series of daily satellite-observed surface melt flux for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The annual meltwater volume in Greenland has significantly increased, with intensified melt in the northern basins dominated by a negative North Atlantic Oscillation and elevated melt flux in western basins driven by the decline in Arctic sea-ice. In East Antarctica, high melt rates since 2000 are attributed to warm air incursions from the Southern Ocean due to anomalous atmospheric circulations associated with a negative Southern Annular Mode and the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole. This region, previously less prone to surface melt, has become a melt hotspot, potentially leading to meltwater ponding and future ice shelf destabilization.

 Europe’s rural landscapes, shaped over millennia, support high biodiversity but often have lower living standards than urban areas, potentially leading to social and environmental injustice. Here we studied biodiversity and socioeconomic settings in Central and Eastern European villages across landscape complexity and urbanization gradients. We surveyed the biodiversity of villages by sampling nine taxonomic groups, including plants, arthropods and birds. We found 15% lower multitrophic diversity in villages in agricultural than in forest-dominated landscapes. City vicinity enhanced human well-being (estimated with Better Life Index) but did not affect biodiversity despite a larger human footprint. In agglomerated villages in forest-dominated landscapes, biodiversity was high, with higher Better Life Index and footprint metrics, suggesting associations between biodiversity, socioeconomic status and, thus, environmental injustice.

 River and tidal dynamics regulate delta water levels, underpinning their ecological and socio-economic stability. Deltaic water level resilience, the capacity to recover from disturbances, is vital amid growing climate and human pressures, necessitating a robust method to quantify and monitor it. Here we define water level resilience as the rate of water level recovery post-hydrodynamic disturbances. We quantify resilience trends using autocorrelation and propose a high-dimensional resilience transmission method based on a vine Copula model to estimate the spatial propagation of resilience loss across subsystems. Applying this framework to the Pearl River Delta in China reveals spatial heterogeneity and inter-subsystem transmission of resilience loss driven by anthropogenic activities. Our approach can be extended to other major deltas, despite differing hydrodynamic and human impacts. The findings underscore the need for tailored management strategies addressing specific drivers and subsystem interactions, offering critical insights into the global delta preservation amid escalating environmental challenges.

Proactive narratives, like ones advocating for both personal behavior and policy action, are widely endorsed, but both the public and policymakers greatly underestimate their popularity (a case of pluralistic ignorance), especially for narratives calling for systemic change. Greater endorsement of these narratives corresponded to greater willingness to take personal and political actions and support climate policy.

 Understanding the effect of marine heatwaves on organisms is central for improving climate change predictions. Even moderate heatwave events are likely to drive performance of organisms especially if they are long relative to the life cycle duration. In ectotherms, such events will affect biological time on a stage-dependent basis; they could alter the timing of life cycle events (e.g. spawning, reproduction) and cause reproductive failure. We use a mathematical framework to explore three different scenarios for the causal relationship between temperature and developmental time and help future experimental research. Here, we highlight the need to experimentally test for (1) stage-dependent responses to temperature and (2) plastic responses to the thermal history.

 Extreme stratospheric events, such as sudden stratospheric warmings or strong polar vortex events, can have a persistent influence on winter surface weather. While these changes often lead to shifts in extratropical cyclone tracks and increased risk of extreme winds, flooding, or heavy snowfall, there has been no systematic effort to quantify their associated impacts with respect to stratospheric forcing. Here we establish the connection between stratospheric extreme events and midlatitude storms in the Euro-Atlantic region using reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and impact datasets. We show that storm-related hazards in northern Europe occur more frequently following strong vortex events than after sudden stratospheric warmings. Moreover, stratospheric forcing shapes the geographic pattern of storm impacts. Quantifying these connections - from precursors to hazards and impacts - can enable earlier warnings for society and for decision-makers in sectors such as emergency preparedness, public health, energy, and water management.

 Constraining the timing of accretion, differentiation, and breakup of early-formed protoplanets helps to unravel the Solar System’s evolution. The recent discovery of the oldest crustal material, Erg Chech 002, has provided important constraints on the timing of accretion and magmatism in the inner Solar System. Based on the age discrepancies of iron meteorites and basalts from the inner and outer Solar System reservoirs, it is accepted that protoplanets in the inner Solar System formed first. However, here we report on Northwest Africa 12264, a dunite originating from the outer Solar System, which records in-situ Pb–Pb and 26Al–26Mg ages of 4569.8 ± 4.6 and 4564.44 ± 0.30 Ma, respectively. This demonstrates that protoplanets beyond the snowline accreted, differentiated, and broke apart rapidly and concurrently with those in the inner Solar System. Our findings are consistent with observations of exoprotoplanetary disks that imply rapid planetesimal formation coincided across radial distances.

 The rapid warming of the Tibetan Plateau, at more than twice the global average, raises urgent questions about how quickly alpine aquatic ecosystem can respond. Here, using lake sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) and photosynthetic pigment analysis, we investigated algal productivity and diversity (alpha, beta) changes in a Tibetan glacier lake, Guozha Co, China, and by integrating regional lake records, we further estimated the rate of change (RoC) associated with lake ecosystem and temperature over the past two centuries. Our findings reveal that while the RoC of algal communities historically tracked temperature trends, a significant divergence emerged in the 1980s, with the ecological RoC surpassing that of climate warming. The observed shift from cold-tolerant to warm-adapted algal species, alongside enhanced primary productivity, is closely linked to rising temperatures and the cascading effects of glacier retreat. This rate mismatch signals a significant disruption in the long-standing equilibrium between climate and aquatic ecosystems, with potentially far-reaching consequences for alpine biodiversity conservation under accelerating global change.

 We have leveraged the rapid growth of satellite-tracked drifting fish-aggregating-devices used by the fishing industry to evaluate their potential as ocean observing systems. Ocean currents derived from fish-aggregating-devices were compared with those from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s global ocean forecast system and the Global Drifter Program in the Western Central Pacific Ocean. Using the Lagrangian modeling framework OceanPARCELS, we assessed the model’s ability to reproduce fine-scale circulation features. Our analysis revealed a strong correlation between fish-aggregating-devices speeds and observed currents both from drifter buoys and modeled currents from the forecast system. These findings demonstrate the value of fish-aggregating-devices as a complementary observational platform for verifying global ocean forecast systems. Their large numbers and broad spatial coverage offer a key advantage over the relatively sparse drifter buoy network, enhancing the resolution and reliability of ocean current observations in data-sparse regions.

 Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) emitted by plants as a byproduct of photosynthesis provides critical insights into vegetation health and climate regulation. However, detecting the weak SIF signal from small telluric oxygen absorption features remains challenging. ESA’s upcoming Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) mission will retrieve full-spectrum SIF data at 300 m spatial resolution. In the meantime, we propose an alternative approach to reconstruct full-spectrum SIF from O2A and O2B bands using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry, and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. Based on 100,000 SCOPE simulations (640–850 nm at 1 nm resolution), the SIF signals in the O2A (760 nm) and O2B (687 nm) bands showed high correlations with adjacent spectral regions and the full spectrum (R2>0.89). From this data, we derived linear regression functions linking SIF at the O2A (760 nm) and O2B (687 nm) bands to the first two principal components (PCs), enabling inverse PCA transformation to reconstruct full-spectrum SIF with R2>0.98 and RMSE <0.12mW m−2nm−1sr−1. Applying the functions to HyPlant airborne SIF maps (1.7 m resolution) in northeastern Spain, and subsequent PC transformation, successfully reconstructed full-spectrum SIF including peaks and total emitted flux (SIFTot) with propagated uncertainties. To transfer this airborne full-spectrum SIF data to the satellite scale, we then trained an emulator with PRecursore IperSpectrale de la Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance spectra as input to produce spaceborne synthetic full-spectral SIF maps at 30 m resolution, and resampled to the nominal 300 m FLEX resolution. Despite PRISMA’s lower spectral resolution for SIF retrieval, the emulator reliably produced full-spectrum SIF with R2 of 0.69 and 0.52 for SIF760 and SIF687 bands, enabling FLEX-like SIF products (e.g., peaks, SIFTot). This reconstruction and upscaling approach demonstrates its utility for generating FLEX-compatible SIF datasets, supporting FLEX’ mission preparation and cal/val activities."

 The oceanic Kármán vortex street is a significant fluid dynamics phenomenon resulting from the unsteady separation of the boundary layer behind a bluff body. In this study, multispectral images from the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) were utilized to observe oceanic vortex streets in the Yellow Sea from 2021 to 2024. A statistical analysis of 114 vortex streets was conducted from both dynamic and morphological perspectives. The relationship between vortex streets and ocean currents was explored from multiple perspectives, including single-factor statistical analysis, multi-factor statistical analysis, and case studies. Experimental results indicate that the formation of vortex streets in the Yellow Sea is primarily driven by interactions between tidal currents and islands. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal distribution and characteristic parameters of oceanic vortex streets were analysed using time-series SDGSAT-1 data. The observation frequency of oceanic vortex streets follows a general pattern of higher frequency in winter and lower frequency in summer, with most characteristic parameters being stronger in winter and weaker in summer. The seasonal characteristics of tidal currents have a significant impact on the vortex street characteristics. High-resolution satellite imagery reveals that the average aspect ratio of vortex streets is 2.75 and the Reynolds number is 403.56 in winter, compared to 1.92 and 185.86, respectively, in summer.

 Uncertainty in the trends and variations of climate variables in climate data records is as important to understand as climate trends and variations themselves. Metrology provides the framework for assessing and budgeting uncertainty but the application of metrology to climate data records derived from Earth Observation is a scientific and technical challenge and a matter of research. We applied Monte Carlo methodology to demonstrate the end-to-end uncertainty budget for the quantitative variables (seasonal land surface spectral reflectance and plant functional type fractional coverage) of the Land Cover project within ESA’s Climate Change Initiative on the example of one year of Sentinel-3 OLCI remote sensing data and study cases in Africa, Europe, and South America. The budget considers most important sources of errors and takes account of uncorrelated and fully correlated random error structures. The interquartile range of relative standard uncertainty per datum of yearly land surface spectral reflectance is 0.050–0.108 at 490 nm, 0.015–0.046 at 560 nm, 0.007–0.062 at 665 nm, and 0.008–0.024 at 885 nm. The uncorrelated random component of seasonal land surface reflectance uncertainty diminishes with the duration of the season. Spectrally anti-correlated errors in seasonal land surface reflectance composites were attributed to a maximum spectral index selection criterion used for daily image composition. The typical range of standard uncertainty per datum of plant functional type fractional area coverage is 0.3 to 30.8 percent and depends on type abundance. Up to 3.5 percent of fractional coverage uncertainty is attributed to random fluctuation, higher uncertainty is caused by the variation of land cover classes. Errors in plant functional type fractional area coverage are typically anti-correlated. Confusion between natural and managed grass drives the uncertainty in African savannah."

 Accurate and dynamic estimates of anthropogenic emissions are crucial for developing and evaluating emission reduction measures. In this study, an improved superposition column model based on TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column density is used to estimate the chemical lifetime of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and daily NOx and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in typical megacities of China. The average NOx lifetimes are: Beijing 5.02 ± 1.71 h, Zhengzhou 3.89 ± 1.4 h, Wuhan 2.09 ± 0.69 h, Shanghai 2.45 ± 0.83 h. The estimated NOx and CO2 emissions agree well with these of bottom-up emission inventories. Despite a steady decline in NOx emissions of all the four megacities owing to emission control measures during 2019–2021, CO2 emissions increase in Beijing and Zhengzhou. The daily variations of NOx and CO2 emissions can clearly capture the sudden decline of NOx and CO2 emissions during COVID-19 lockdowns. Furthermore, the main sources of NOx and CO2 shifted from industry to transportation and from industry to power respectively with the rapid emission reduction of different sectors. The distinct CO2-to-NOx ratios across sectors in the four megacities impact the speed of NOx and CO2 emission reduction and emphasize the necessity of coordinated emission reduction of NOx and CO2 emissions. In addition, emission amounts between weekdays and weekends exhibit very different variations in these megacities. Considering the dramatic changes of the NOx and CO2 emissions, it's necessary to conduct a regular estimation of anthropogenic emissions from the major sources."

 Dust devils, which are rotating vortices, frequently occur on the surface layer of dry land. The impacts of meteorological factors on dust devil properties at higher altitudes remain largely unexplored owing to a shortage of in situ observations on small-scale and short-lived vortices. Using radiosonde profiles and ERA5 reanalysis data together with a large eddy model (LEM), this study investigates the effects of surface pressure, surface sensible heat flux, surface wind and surface roughness on dust devil properties in the Qaidam Basin, which is located at the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The results of this study indicate that the LEM is capable of capturing the detailed characteristics of dust devil vortices reported in previous observations. The analysis also revealed that the numbers and lifetime of dust devils increase with the surface pressure. As the surface sensible heat flux increases, dust devils tend to be more intense, accompanied by a slight decrease in lifetime and minor variations in diameter.A slight decrease in numbers is observed with increasing surface sensible heat flux. This is likely because large surface sensible heat flux reduces the convective ratio (w⁎/u⁎) and significantly enhances turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation in the near-surface layer, which does not favor the formation of dust devils. With the intensification of surface winds, the number of dust devils notably reduces, which is associated with the decrease in w⁎/u⁎ and the temperature lapse rate (LR). Furthermore, as the surface wind increases, the cellular convection tends to involve convective rolls, which hinders the formation of dust devils. Finally, our analysis reveals that the tilting angles of dust devils increase with increasing surface roughness."

 Experiments were performed at the Mainz vertical wind tunnel where two types of drop breakup were investigated with freely floating drops. Spontaneous breakup under laminar conditions resulted in 5 % breakup events of drops with equivalent diameters between 8 and 13 mm by separating in the center due to strong oscillations in horizontal mode into two nearly equal sized fragments. In a turbulent airflow, several oscillation types mainly in vertical and transverse directions caused significant deformations of the drops, which seemed to promote the coherence of the drops. Collision-induced breakup occurs when two drops collide and break up into several fragments. To fill the gaps of missing drop sizes in earlier measurements, a set of relevant drop pairs with diameters of 4.0 to 5.2 mm and 1.9 to 3.1 mm was investigated. With a mean breakup efficiency of 0.55, approximately half of breakup events resulted in two or three fragments, the other half in the formation of more than 3 up to 9 fragments. The measured fragment size distributions were compared to results from earlier parameterizations so that modifications due to the new data set were identified. Accompanying the experiments, process studies with a 3D cloud model were performed to study the impact of breakup on drop size distributions and precipitation. It was found that breakup reduces the numbers of the largest raindrops, thereby delays the onset of precipitation, possibly reduces total precipitation amounts and changes the local distribution of precipitation. Important parameters in the process studies were the breakup efficiency as well as the fragment numbers and sizes."

Community-associated methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureusUSA300, for instance, is a lineage responsible for the epidemic of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in humans. Owing to its human tropism, mechanisms that enabled the rise of USA300 as a major skin pathogen remain incompletely defined. By leveraging a rodent-adapted strain ofS. aureus, we developed a natural model of SSTIs. We found that LukMF′, a pore-forming leukocidin homolog to the human-specific LukSF-PV toxin, drives skin pathology in mice. LukMF′ lyses neutrophils via the chemokine receptor CCR1, which in turn fuels inflammatory pathology and microbial survival within the infectious nidus. Ablation of CCR1, depletion of neutrophils, or vaccination with LukMF′ all protected mice from skin pathology. Thus, these data support epidemiological studies linking leukocidins with human SSTIs and highlight the power of natural models to unearth potential targets to curtail infections."

Amyloid-β, the main component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease, has been shown to be generated in the presence of microbes. Entrapment of microbes by aggregated amyloid-β may serve as an innate immune response to pathogenic infections. To understand the association of amyloid-β plaques and pathogenic infections in the central nervous system, we obtained viable short-interval postmortem human retinal tissue and generated human retinal organoids that contain electrophysiologically active neurons. Here, we demonstrate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces amyloid-β extracellular protein aggregates in human retinal explants and retinal organoids. Last, pharmacological inhibition of neuropilin-1 resulted in reduced amyloid-β deposition in human retinal explants treated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 protein. These results suggest that Spike 1 protein, during infection with SARS-CoV-2, can induce amyloid-β aggregation, which may be associated with the neurological symptoms experienced in COVID-19."

The antiviral role of RNAi in mammalian cells remains controversial while a number of viral suppressors of RNAi (VSR) able to inhibit Dicer activity and promote infection have been identified. Here, we explored the integrity and functional role of Dicer during FMDV infection. These studies showed that the FMDV-encoded Leader protease (Lpro) specifically cleaves Dicer at a conserved DExD/H helicase motif releasing the complete N-terminal helicase domain. Dicer cleavage by Lpro suppressed small hairpin RNA (shRNA)–induced RNAi in swine cells. Silencing of Dicer conferred increased susceptibility to an Lpro-deficient FMDV, revealing a Dicer-dependent antiviral effect which can be effectively counteracted by Lpro. This mutant generated a remarkably different profile of viral small RNAs (vsRNAs) in infected cells compared with the wild-type virus. Overall, we identified a viral mechanism of dampening or modulating antiviral defenses based on Dicer proteolytic degradation."

While DOT1L regulates transcription and the pathogenesis of leukemia and neurological disorders, the role of H3K79me remains elusive.

Simultaneous catalytic inactivation of DOT1L and the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2 (SET domain containing 2) leads to hyperactive transcription and failures in neural differentiation. H3K79me/H3K36me3 loss causes increased transcription elongation, gained chromatin accessibility at a group of enhancers, and increased recruitment of TEAD4 (TEA domain transcription factor 4) and its coactivator YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) to these enhancers. Furthermore, YAP-TEAD inhibition restores the expression levels of genes hyperactivated by H3K79me/H3K36me3 loss.

McGuire,Mitochondrial dysfunction enhances influenza pathogenesis by up-regulating de novo sialic acid biosynthesis,"Mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger metabolic adaptations that resemble those induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here, we show that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) impairment, modeled byNdufs4deficiency, reprograms lung epithelial metabolism to promote IAV pathogenesis. In bothNdufs4knockout (KO) mice and lung epithelial cells, OXPHOS deficiency increased glycolytic flux, diverting carbons into hexosamine and de novo sialic acid (SIA) biosynthesis pathways. This led to elevated sialylation and enhanced viral attachment. InNdufs4KO models, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase signaling was insufficient to blunt this increased metabolic flux. IAV infection further exacerbated this metabolic vulnerability, amplifying SIA and viral burden. Pharmacologic rerouting of glucose carbons with dichloroacetate reduced sialylation, viral replication, and inflammatory responses inNdufs4KO models. These findings reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction enhances IAV susceptibility by disrupting energy sensing and fueling viral receptor biosynthesis, highlighting the importance of epithelial metabolism in viral pathogenesis and suggesting metabolic modulation as a potential therapeutic."

Seismic data reveal extensive polygonal fault systems (PFSs) in the input sequences of the Hikurangi Margin and Nankai Trough. The mechanical and hydrological effects of these incoming PFSs on subduction zones are potentially substantial. Here, we investigate their effects following transport into the accretionary wedge by integrating discrete-element modeling with three-dimensional seismic interpretation. We find that the typical dips of the incoming PFSs overlap with modeled dips prone to reactivation and confirm that subducting PFSs can be reactivated and gradually evolve into major thrust faults. Comparisons with electromagnetic data indicate that PFSs may provide conduits for fluid leakage along the plate interface, coincide with disrupted strata and decreased shear stress, and enhance geometric and stress heterogeneity along the megathrust. These suggest that PFSs may play a previously unrecognized role in contributing to shallow slow earthquake phenomena in subduction zones."

Although photocatalysis enables cofactor regeneration in synthetic biological systems, the generated reactive oxygen can deactivate enzymes. Here, we engineer photobiocatalytic artificial cells that modulate hepatocyte metabolism through alleviating alcohol-induced oxidative stress. These artificial cells feature nano-organelles that segregate incompatible modules: one for photocatalytic cofactor regeneration and another for biocatalytic alcohol metabolism. This spatial separation ensures sustainable cofactor provision and protects enzymes from oxidative damage. Co-compartmentalization of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase within a single nano-organelle enhances cascade reaction efficiency while inhibiting intermediate leakage. When cocultured with hepatocytes, these artificial cells demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and efficiently mitigate oxidative stress from alcohol metabolism. This work advances artificial cells from proof of concept to practical application in living systems.

The Rab11 family (Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25) controls the return of internalized cargos to the plasma membrane, and Rab25 has been implicated in the aggressiveness of cancer by promoting invasive migration. However, while Rab25 vesicles distribute to the leading edge of moving cells, how directly they contribute to cell protrusion is not clear. Here, we adopt a magnetogenetic approach that allows direct manipulation of Rab25 positioning to show that localization to the cell periphery drives the formation of F-actin protrusions. We demonstrate that endogenous Rab25 vesicles coordinate the positioning of key cargos, including the actin regulator FMNL1 and integrin β1, with the activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases at the plasma membrane to generate and maintain F-actin–rich filopodium-like protrusions and promote cancer cell invasive migration in the three-dimensional matrix."

Mesotrypsin, implicated in cancer progression, exemplifies these difficulties; no current inhibitors achieve selectivity over other human trypsins. We found an unexpected autoinhibited conformation of mesotrypsin via x-ray crystallography, revealing a cryptic pocket adjacent to the active site. Using high-throughput virtual screening targeting this cryptic pocket, we identified a conformationally selective small-molecule inhibitor that stabilizes the inactive state of mesotrypsin. This inhibitor demonstrates selectivity for mesotrypsin over other trypsins. Our findings challenge the accepted view of digestive trypsins as constitutively active enzymes lacking potential for allosteric regulation. Furthermore, analyses of other structures suggest that dynamic sampling of closed states with analogous allosteric cryptic pockets appears widespread among S1 serine proteases. These observations point to a potentially generalizable strategy to achieve selective inhibition, offering broad implications for drug development targeting serine proteases in cancer and other diseases."

A distinguishing feature of the group is the presence of a buried arginine residue close to the cytoplasmic face. Combining single-particle cryo–electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography with rhodopsin activation by light, we demonstrate that the arginine stabilizes an ultraviolet (UV)–absorbing intermediate of an extremely slow CryoRhodopsin photocycle.

Heteroresistance occurs when a predominantly susceptible bacterial population harbors a rare resistant subpopulation. During antibiotic exposure, these resistant bacteria can be selected and lead to treatment failure. Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods often fail to reliably detect these subpopulations due to their low frequency, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic approaches. Here, we present a droplet microfluidics method where bacteria are encapsulated in droplets containing growth medium and antibiotics. The growth of rare resistant cells is detected by observing droplet shrinkage under microscopy. We validated this method for three clinically important antibiotics inEscherichia coliisolates obtained from bloodstream infections and showed that it can detect resistant subpopulations as infrequent as 10−6using only 200 to 300 droplets.

The MD-FET enables a perfect off state, as the elastic tunneling is forbidden by the momentum mismatch between the cross 1D contacts. It can also access a substantial on state, because the momentum mismatch can be compensated by the electron-phonon scattering in a 2D channel. The MD-FET with sub–1-nm channel thus exhibits high on/off ratios of ~107, which breaks through the theoretical limit on the short-channel effect.

Consequently, α/β-MgAgSb can simultaneously achieve high maximum conversion efficiency exceeding 10% (9%) and maximum power density above 1 (0.9) W cm−2by simulation (experiment), outperforming most p-type materials under identical conditions. In addition, a two-pair thermoelectric module combining α/β-MgAgSb with n-type Mg3Sb0.6Bi1.4achieves an unprecedented power density, representing notable advancements over existing Mg3(Sb,Bi)2/MgAgSb two-pair system. These findings highlight the immense potential of α/β-MgAgSb for thermoelectric applications and provide insights into the design of high-power thermoelectrics."

Nonetheless, the complexities of self-regulating stress or structural characteristics through growth or gene expression render the anti-wrinkling of “nonliving” artificial surfaces using bionic principles a pressing yet formidable challenge. Here, inspired by nonliving dehydrated leaves, we propose an on-demand customizable, material invariant, parametric surface anti-wrinkling strategy using leaf vein–imitated boundary curvature–coupled constraints. This strategy allows for an exact surface customization with enhanced anti-wrinkling capability, tailored to specific anti-wrinkling demands while maintaining the original cross-section materials. The defined parameters, anti-wrinkling width and concave radius, are customized by the anti-wrinkling design criteria via the dimensionless dual-correction stiffness model, which are simple linear or quadratic functions of anti-wrinkling demands and cross-section properties. Experiments at different scales and materials validate the correctness of the design criteria. The strategy in this study is effective on diverse wrinkle-prone surfaces at multiple scales and can inform real engineering design of the nonliving artificial surfaces."

We conducted multiomic profiling on tumor samples from 149 Chinese patients with breast cancer across ER−HER2+, ER+HER2+, and ER−HER2−subtypes, categorizing outcomes as pathologic complete response (pCR;n= 81) or residual disease (RD;n= 68). We identified distinct molecular features linked to pCR in each subtype: elevated cell proliferation in patients with ER−HER2−pCR, higherCDKN2Amethylation in patients with ER−HER2−RD, increasedKITmethylation in patients with ER−HER2+RD, andMAP4K1hypermethylation in patients with ER+HER2+RD. These findings were subsequently validated in independent datasets. By integrating clinical and multiomic data, we developed MOPCR, a subtype-specific machine learning model that outperformed single-omic approaches in predicting treatment response. MOPCR demonstrated potential generalizability across cohorts and provided preliminary stratification of patient subgroups with higher pCR probability, offering valuable insights for precision cancer management."

An effective COVID-19 vaccine providing durable immunity with minimal reactogenicity is needed. CVXGA1, a PIV5-based intranasal COVID-19 vaccine expressing the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, was evaluated in this phase 1 study in adults and teens. CVXGA1 was well tolerated without serious adverse events (AEs) or fever reported. Solicited local and systemic AEs were mostly mild. CVXGA1 elicited S-specific serum and mucosal antibodies and CD8+cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in all groups. Significantly lower rates of symptomatic COVID-19 infection were reported in groups receiving high-dose CVXGA1 (HD) compared to that in the group receiving low-dose CVXGA1 (LD) during the SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron waves.

Singh,TP53 missense–specific transcriptional plasticity drives resistance against cell cycle inhibitors in pancreatic cancer,"In ~70% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, theTP53gene acquires gain-of-function (GOF) mutations leading to rapid disease progression. Specifically, missense p53 (misp53) GOF mutations associate with therapy resistance and worse clinical outcomes. However, the molecular functions of distinct misp53 mutants in plasticity and therapy response remain unclear. Integrating multicenter patient data and multi-omics, we report that the misp53R273H/Cmutant is associated with cell cycle progression and a basal-like state compared to the misp53R248W/Qmutant. Loss of misp53R273H/Cdecreased tumor growth and liver metastasis while prolonging survival in preclinical models. We found that misp53R273H/Cspecifically regulated the Rb/DREAM axis involved in cell cycle regulation. Notably, a clinical CDK4/6 inhibitor reduced misp53R273H/Cmutant expression. However, it triggered MAPK/ERK-mediated resistance mechanisms, enhancing cell survival and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combining MAPK/ERK and CDK4/6 inhibitors reduced misp53R273H/C-associated oncogenic functions. Thus, distinct misp53 mutants show unique cell-intrinsic plasticity, therapeutic vulnerabilities, and resistance mechanisms."

Here, we challenge this pan-Arctic glaciation hypothesis by investigating two sites from the Arctic-Atlantic gateway (AAG) and the Nordic Seas. Suborbital to millennial-scale surface water bioproductivity changes provide no evidence for a continuous ice shelf in the AAG and the Nordic Seas over the past ~750,000 years. Instead, proxy data and model simulations reveal the persistent presence of seasonal sea ice cover and open water phytoplankton blooms during both glacial and interglacial times. If the AAG and Nordic Seas were ever covered by an ice shelf during these times, then it must have been a partial, or at best, a very short-lived glacial phenomenon."

However, traditional fabrication methods are usually complex and expensive, and the prepared MHR’s locomotion is monotonous with limited capacity. Here, we present a cost-effective, customizable, and scalable fabrication craft of MHR, via using bent needle tips to engrave helical structures onto polymethyl methacrylate substrates and incorporating nanoparticle alignment strategies to create ferrofluidic helical miniature robots (FHMRs) with cross-scale size scopes. We then propose strategic magnetic driving methods that enable FHMRs with five powerful motion modes for negotiating various application scenarios. Experimental results show that FHMRs can move flexibly and effectively simulate thrombus removal within a vascular model by integrating multiple motion modes. Furthermore, modified FHMRs can swiftly deliver drugs to targeted areas, with the capability for phased release on surfaces of wrinkled physiological tissues. These advancements highlight the considerable potential of FHMRs for future applications in the biomedical field."
