10.1088/1748-9326/ad961d,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文关注的是中国和印度在未来气候变化情景下，高温、PM2.5和O3极端事件同时发生的加剧趋势。即使在严格的空气污染控制措施下，模型预测显示，这些极端事件的共同发生频率仍然会显著增加。研究使用了区域气候-化学耦合模型，对2096-2100年与2010-2014年相比进行了预测。其结果与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为对PM2.5和O3等大气成分的准确监测，以及对气温和污染物时空分布的卫星观测数据，都是构建和验证此类气候-化学模型的关键。此外，研究的最终目标是评估这些极端事件对健康的影响，这与大气环境遥感技术的应用直接相关。,"['PM2.5', 'O3', 'heat waves', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'climate modeling', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'health impact assessment']",Meng Gao;Fan Wang;Yangyang Xu;Ji Chen;Xiao Lu;Gregory R Carmichael,"Future intensification of co-occurrences of heat, PM2.5 and O3 extremes in China and India despite stringent air pollution controls","Heat and air pollution extremes are two leading global health stressors, both of which are particularly serious in China and India. It is well recognized that exposure to co-occurrence of heat and air pollution extremes will cause amplified health outcomes, yet century‐long understanding of future co‐occurrence is still lacking. On the basis of sophisticated regional coupled climate-chemistry modeling, we predict future individual and joint occurrences of heat and air pollution extremes in China and India in 2096–2100 relative to 2010–2014. We find intensified co-occurrences of heat and air pollution extremes in both China and India, despite reductions in projected emissions and improved air quality. Under the medium air pollution control of SSP245, the frequency of Tw&amp;PM&amp;O3 joint hazard increases by 382% in North India, and 729% in Beijing by the end of this century. Given the significant role of temperature changes in the co-occurrence and larger compounding health impacts, actions are urgently needed to reduce exposure to co-extreme events."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad984b,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了利用公开的OpenET数据简化科罗拉多河盆地农业用水核算的方法。OpenET利用遥感技术，特别是卫星图像和地表温度数据，估算作物蒸散发量（ET），这与农业用水量密切相关。研究表明，该方法能够快速、透明地估算盆地范围内的农业用水量，并与美国垦务局的数据高度一致。该方法不仅能用于盆地尺度的水资源管理，还能指导田间尺度的节水措施，实现从盆地到田间的协调管理。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是利用遥感技术估算地表蒸散发量，进而用于农业用水管理和水资源规划。,"['Evapotranspiration', 'Remote sensing', 'Land surface temperature', 'Satellite imagery', 'Agricultural water management', 'Water conservation', 'OpenET']",Cameron Wobus;Caroline Nash;Peter Culp;Mary Kelly;Kelly Kennedy,Simplified agricultural water use accounting in the Colorado River Basin using OpenET,"Colorado River agricultural producers are facing the prospect of substantial water use reductions over the coming years in the face of overuse, drought, and the impacts of climate change. To inform management decisions and to ensure that water can be allocated efficiently and equitably, decisionmakers and stakeholders will require new methods of agricultural water use accounting (WUA) that are consistent, transparent, and fast. Here we provide estimates of agricultural water use across the entire Colorado River Basin using publicly available data from OpenET, and we demonstrate strong agreement with available WUA from the US Bureau of Reclamation. Crucially, the methods employed here allow basin-wide agricultural water accounting to be completed in a matter of hours—a process that currently takes months or even years. We demonstrate how these same data can also be used to inform water conservation strategies at the field scale, thereby synchronizing basin-scale water accounting with project-scale conservation planning. We discuss key sources of uncertainty inherent in the methodology, along with strategies for managing those uncertainties to improve agricultural water conservation planning."

Does this advocacy undermine—or bolster—public trust in scientists and support for scientists’ recommendations? We leveraged a unique opportunity to answer this question in a real-world setting: the 2023 referendum for the Swiss climate protection law (CPL), which was supported by a public statement of 252 renowned scientists across disciplines. We conducted a pre-registered, two-wave, quasi-field experiment (npre-vote = 1,622, npost-vote = 891) to test how scientists’ collective support for the law affected public trust in scientists and voting behavior. We found that scientists’ advocacy was associated with greater public trust, particularly among left-leaning individuals; only a minority viewed these scientists as not objective. However, perceptions of scientists’ role in society and policymaking and voting behavior remained largely unaffected when participants were reminded of the CPL advocacy. Although we studied a restrained form of policy advocacy in a somewhat unique setting, our study challenges the widespread assumption that policy advocacy undermines public trust in scientists."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad9850,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是能源获取与人口增长之间的关系，以及普遍使用现代能源对能源需求和气候目标的影响。研究人员构建了一个微观模拟模型，模拟了赞比亚未来人口规模和构成，并考虑了能源获取和教育对生育率的影响。结果表明，普及现代能源虽然会增加电力消耗，但由于传统燃料使用减少和人口增长放缓，总体能源需求会降低。这与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。研究的核心在于人口统计学和能源经济学模型的构建与应用，而非大气环境的直接观测和分析。,[],Camille Belmin;Peter-Paul Pichler;Guillaume Marois;Shonali Pachauri;Helga Weisz,The energy–population dividend: evidence from energy-specific population projections,"In a climate-constrained world, understanding the energy required to achieve universal access to modern energy is critical. This requires making assumptions on future population trajectories. Although access to modern energy can affect population dynamics, this feedback has not yet been accounted for in demographic models. Access to modern energy leads to fertility declines as it reduces child mortality, improves health, increases women’s access to information, education and employment. In this paper we present a demographic model that endogenizes the effect of increased access to modern energy on population dynamics and estimates the size of this effect on total final energy use by households for the case of Zambia. To do so, we built a microsimulation model to project future population size and composition, accounting for how fertility depends on access to modern energy and education. We used these population projections to then estimate household energy demand of the Zambian population until 2070, under different scenarios. We found that in 2070, while electricity consumption is higher in a universal access scenario compared to a baseline scenario, total energy demand is 29% lower, partly due to a strong decline in the use of inefficient traditional cooking fuels. We also found that reduced population growth due to universal energy access contributes to lowering the energy demand by 56% by 2050, compared to a more limited expansion in energy access, and this contribution increases over time. Although the challenge of achieving universal access to modern energy seems daunting, our results suggest that this could have co-benefits with achieving climate goals. Our study also reveals that accounting for the energy–population dividend in energy models will scale down the currently assumed energy needs to ensure a decent life for all."

However, our understanding of the impact of these events on phytoplankton, the primary producers in the marine food web, remains incomplete. In this study, we elucidated the phytoplankton responses during MHWs in the NEP between 1998 and 2022 and revealed contrasting phytoplankton chlorophyll anomalies between the north and south of the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (TZCF). Specifically, chlorophyll shows a marked increase north of the TZCF but a decrease south of it, with the most pronounced negative anomalies centered on the TZCF. Additionally, this chlorophyll response exhibits a remarkable seasonality, consistent with the seasonal migration of the TZCF. Weakened subpolar southward Ekman transport, which may have resulted in reduced phytoplankton nutrient supply, is likely to be the major contributor to the negative chlorophyll response in this frontal region. Our results highlight the importance of previously unrecognized spatial and temporal heterogeneity of phytoplankton responses to MHWs in the NEP, which may provide insights for future ecosystem conservation and fisheries management in the NEP under MHWs."

Climate change poses a growing threat to global food and nutrition security, but existing climate risk assessments often overlook the critical roles of both terrestrial and aquatic nutrient-rich foods that are vital for dietary diversity and micronutrient supply. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework that integrates data on future climate extremes, nutrient supply dependencies, and diet-related climate vulnerability. Our comprehensive analysis assesses nutrition-sensitive climate risk to five essential micronutrients across production systems. By mid-century (2041–2060), we estimate that 75% of calcium, 30% of folate, 39% of iron, 68% of vitamin A, and 79% of vitamin B12 produced in primary food products will face frequent climate extremes (at least every other year) globally. Nearly fifty countries are projected to face high domestic climate risk for two or more micronutrients during this period, with ten countries facing high risk across all five. We outline distinct climate risk profiles to offer data-driven entry points into strategies for bolstering the resilience of micronutrient supply chains and advancing progress toward global nutrient targets in the face of a changing climate."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad9b3d,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是改进经验分位数映射方法，以更好地校正气候模型模拟中的极端值偏差。它主要集中在气候模拟数据后处理和偏差校正，而不是大气环境遥感技术本身。虽然气候模型模拟可能使用遥感数据进行验证或驱动，但这篇论文的重点是改进偏差校正方法，而不是开发或应用遥感技术。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的相关性较弱。,"['climate model simulations', 'precipitation', 'extreme values', 'bias correction', 'empirical quantile mapping']",Kyuhyun Byun;Alan F Hamlet,An improved empirical quantile mapping approach for bias correction of extreme values in climate model simulations,"Quantifying and correcting biases in modeling simulations is crucial for deriving meaningful findings across various scientific disciplines. Climate model simulations, in particular, often exhibit systemic biases when compared to observations. These biases may persist in future climate simulations, affecting the results of many climate change impact assessment studies. Empirical quantile mapping (QM) is a widely used method to correct these biases by mapping quantiles between observed and simulated cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). However, empirical QM faces a fundamental challenge when the CDF of future simulations differs from historical simulations, potentially leading to extreme values falling outside the historical CDF range. To address this issue, our study introduces a novel approach to extrapolate future extreme values for bias correction, preserving the rank order of simulated future extremes. By construction, our approach ensures that bias-corrected values are not exaggerated and retain the rank structure of the original simulated data while preserving climate change signals in the bias-corrected outputs. In addition, our approach includes a technique to adjust the wet-day frequency for precipitation by preserving the ratio of wet-day frequency between observations and historical model simulations."

An analysis of the theoretical housing potential of under-occupied dwellings in the European building stock,"The standard response to the shortage of housing across the political spectrum is to build new housing units. From an environmental perspective, there is a need to decarbonise the housing sector as quickly as possible and to reduce land and resource consumption. This contradiction could be resolved by making more efficient use of dwellings that are under-occupied (for example, after children have moved out). In this article, we analyse the theoretical housing potential of under-occupied living space. To this end, we use established occupancy regulations of Swiss cooperatives and municipal housing authorities, where the number of residents must always be at least equal to the number of rooms minus one or minus two. This defines an upper limit for ‘needs-based living’ that has been tested in practice and is comparatively broadly legitimised. Using this threshold, and based on Data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, we identify a theoretical housing potential in the EU stock of approximately 152 million rooms. This implies a theoretical space in the building stock for 50 million additional three-room flats, which equates to housing for 100 million people or 23 % of the EU population. Significant potential exists in all types of regions: cities, towns and rural areas. The under-occupancy is lower in countries with a higher share of small and medium sized flats, which indicates a high influence of the infrastructure on the occupancy. A comparison with the occupancy in Swiss housing markets that have minimum occupancy requirements implemented suggests that a large part of the theoretical potential could be realized by shaping infrastructural and market conditions. We conclude that housing politics should focus on the development of affordable and attractive alternatives for older people and smaller households in order to free up dwellings for families and address social and ecological problems in the housing market simultaneously."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad9c9a,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了2023年12月中旬中国发生的极端冷事件，这是一个从极端高温到极端低温的快速转变过程。研究人员提出了一种新的指标——“闪冷”，来捕捉地表气温的急剧下降。该指标不仅能有效反映极端冷事件的趋势，还能进行每日追踪。论文分析了该事件的四个阶段，并利用拉格朗日温度收支分析，强调了高纬度阻塞环流在“闪冷”阶段的关键作用。文中还探讨了不同天气系统对温度变化的影响，以及潜在的环流异常背景。虽然论文没有直接提及具体的遥感技术，如卫星传感器类型或大气成分分析，但其研究对象——地表气温变化，以及对阻塞环流等大气现象的分析，都与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。例如，气象卫星可以提供地表温度、大气环流等数据，为该研究提供观测依据。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有很强的关联性。,"['surface air temperature', 'cold wave', 'blocking circulation', 'meteorological satellites', 'temperature anomaly', 'weather forecasting', 'climate change']",Huayu Chen;Jilan Jiang;Yimin Liu,Investigating the December 2023 warm-to-cold weather whiplash in China using a novel flash-cold metric,"In mid-December 2023, China experienced an unprecedented cold wave that marked a critical stage in a negative temperature-related weather whiplash event (WWE), which was characterized by a rapid shift from extreme warmth to extreme cold. The traditional metric—temperature variance—is insufficient to reflect the temporal evolution of this WWE. Therefore, we introduce a novel metric termed ‘flash-cold’ to identify the sharp and significant decrease in surface air temperature. This new metric not only effectively captures recent WWEs trend in line with variance-based metric but also allows daily tracking of temperature shifts. Using the flash-cold metric, we delineate the evolution of the WWE case in China into four phases: first warm spell, first flash-cold, second warm spell, and second flash-cold (corresponding to the unprecedented cold wave). A recently proposed Lagrangian temperature budget analysis highlights the crucial role of high-latitude blocking circulation in both flash-cold phases through cold advection. The first flash-cold phase was triggered by backward cold air masses driven by upstream systems associated with Okhotsk blocking, while the second flash-cold phase developed when the trough downstream of Ural blocking moved eastward and rotated counterclockwise. In contrast, subtropical systems moderated the decreasing temperature during the first flash-cold through diabatic processes but had minimal impact on the second flash-cold, helping to explain why the second flash-cold was more intense. From a multiscale interaction perspective, the development of these blocking circulations was facilitated by a background of exceptionally weak meridional gradient of potential vorticity, the smallest recorded since 1979."

Temporal inconsistencies are often mitigated by using TC data from more homogeneous periods. For example, TC records since 1980 are preferred for frequency and track analysis, while records for intensity analysis have become more consistent since ∼2000. However, such measures reduce the sample size for trend analysis, potentially leading to conflicting conclusions due to natural climate-variability. Inter-agency best track data can also vary, due to differences in the way best track information—such as centre fix locations and associated intensity estimates—are defined and assessed. When comparing global datasets and regional datasets, additional inconsistencies can be introduced where TCs form or track just outside the official area of responsibility for each agency. We highlight discrepancies in Australian TC best track data from various sources by comparing it to a more rigorously scrutinized dataset compiled by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. This dataset is found to have highly accurate TC records for the Australian region. We also highlight the implications of data differences on TC-related trend analysis, aiming to increase awareness of dataset inconsistencies while guiding credible climate-change detection and attribution messages."

This study investigates projected changes in compound extreme hot & humid and wet & windy events across Africa by the end of the 21st century (2069–2098). Using the multi-model ensemble mean from the regional climate projections from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment-coordinated output for regional evaluations project, we examined both low/high representative concentration pathway (RCP2.6/8.5) emission scenarios. We estimated population exposure to these joint events by combining climate projections with low/high shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP1/SSP3) population growth scenarios. Broadly, changes are regionally-dependent. In some subregions, we found a substantial increase in the frequency and duration of compound extreme hot & humid events, rising by approximately 100%/600% under RCP2.6/RCP8.5, associated with a rise in extremely hot univariate events. Conversely, compound extreme wet & windy events are projected to weaken, particularly under RCP8.5, with reductions up to 64%, driven in most regions, by declines in extreme wet-only events. Global warming expands historical equatorial hotspots for heat events into eastern and southern Africa, which is less severe under RCP2.6. These changes significantly increase exposed populations to these hazards, affecting up to 668 million person-events across various IPCC reference subregions, especially in West, Central, Northeast, and Southeast Africa, as well as most of West and East South Africa, and Madagascar (MDG). In subregions like the Sahara and West Africa, population growth is the primary driver of exposure to hot & humid events, while in Central, North-East, South-East, West-South, East-South and MDG, climate and interaction effects are more influential. We stress the need to enhance climate adaptation policies, especially in West, Central, Northeast, Southeast Africa and MDG, to address these risks, as they could exacerbate climate refugee migration, heat-related illnesses, food insecurity, and societal instability. We also advocate for disseminating climate services, particularly in low-income countries, to support research for sustainable development."

Ice crystals smaller than 50 µm were found in this optically thin cirrus cloud layer. Combined analysis of back trajectories, satellite, and model data revealed that the formation of this layer was influenced by waves and stratospheric hydration induced by typhoon Hato. 
 We investigate the formation mechanism of a tropopause cirrus cloud layer observed during the Balloon measurement campaigns of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (BATAL) over Hyderabad (17.47° N, 78.58° E), India, on 23 August 2017. Simultaneous measurements from a backscatter sonde and an optical particle counter on board a balloon flight revealed the presence of a subvisible cirrus cloud layer (optical thickness ∼ 0.025) at the cold-point tropopause (temperature ∼ −86.4 °C, altitude ∼ 17.9 km). Ice crystals in this layer are smaller than 50 µm with a layer mean ice crystal number concentration of about 46.79 L−1. Simultaneous backscatter and extinction coefficient measurements allowed us to estimate the range-resolved extinction to backscatter coefficient ratio (lidar ratio) inside this layer with a layer mean value of about 32.18 ± 6.73 sr, which is in good agreement with earlier reported values at similar cirrus cloud temperatures. The formation mechanism responsible for this tropopause cirrus is investigated using a combination of three-dimensional back trajectories, satellite observations, and ERA5 reanalysis data. Satellite observations revealed that the overshooting convection associated with a category 3 typhoon, Hato, which hit Macau and Hong Kong on 23 August 2017, injected ice into the lower stratosphere. This caused a hydration patch that followed the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone to subsequently move towards Hyderabad. The presence of tropopause cirrus cloud layers in the cold temperature anomalies and updrafts along the back trajectories suggested the role of typhoon-induced waves in their formation. This case study highlights the role of typhoons in influencing the formation of tropopause cirrus clouds through stratospheric hydration and waves."

 Two groups of retrieval algorithms, physics based and machine learning (ML) based, each consisting of two independent approaches, have been developed to retrieve cloud base height (CBH) and its diurnal cycle from Himawari-8 geostationary satellite observations. Validations have been conducted using the joint CloudSat/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) CBH products in 2017, ensuring independent assessments. Results show that the two ML-based algorithms exhibit markedly superior performance (the optimal method is with a correlation coefficient of R > 0.91 and an absolute bias of approximately 0.8 km) compared to the two physics-based algorithms. However, validations based on CBH data from the ground-based lidar at the Lijiang station in Yunnan Province and the cloud radar at the Nanjiao station in Beijing, China, explicitly present contradictory outcomes (R < 0.60). An identifiable issue arises with significant underestimations in the retrieved CBH by both ML-based algorithms, leading to an inability to capture the diurnal cycle characteristics of CBH. The strong consistence observed between CBH derived from ML-based algorithms and the spaceborne active sensors of CloudSat/CALIOP may be attributed to utilizing the same dataset for training and validation, sourced from the CloudSat/CALIOP products. In contrast, the CBH derived from the optimal physics-based algorithm demonstrates good agreement in diurnal variations in CBH with ground-based lidar/cloud radar observations during the daytime (with an R value of approximately 0.7). Therefore, the findings in this investigation from ground-based observations advocate for the more reliable and adaptable nature of physics-based algorithms in retrieving CBH from geostationary satellite measurements. Nevertheless, under ideal conditions, with an ample dataset of spaceborne cloud profiling radar observations encompassing the entire day for training purposes, the ML-based algorithms may hold promise for still delivering accurate CBH outputs."

Consecutive peaks in HONO and NO fluxes suggest a potentially enhanced release of HONO and NO due to soil tillage, whereas waterlogged soil may inhibit microbial nitrification processes following irrigation. Notably, biological processes and light-driven NO2 reactions at the surface may serve as sources of HONO and influence the local HONO budget during rotary tillage. 
 Significant amounts of nitrous acid (HONO) released from soil affect the chemistry of the troposphere, thereby serving as a major precursor to hydroxyl radicals. However, the scarcity of in situ data on soil–atmosphere HONO exchange flux has constrained the understanding of emission mechanisms and the budget of reactive nitrogen. Herein, we performed measurements of HONO and NOx fluxes over paddy fields in the Huaihe River Basin. The entire experiment involved various agricultural-management activities, including rotary tillage, flood irrigation, fertilization, paddy cultivation and growth, and top dressing. HONO and NO exhibited more upward fluxes, whereas NO2 was deposited on the ground, with average hourly fluxes of 0.07±0.22, 0.19±0.53, and -0.42±0.44 nmol m−2 s−1, respectively. Continuous peaks in HONO and NO fluxes were observed during the rotary tillage period, and they exhibited a significant correlation (R=0.77). Moreover, a significant correlation (R=0.60) between HONO flux and the product of J(NO2) × NO2 was observed during the daytime. The results indicate that both biological emissions from soil and light-driven NO2 conversion are likely active, collectively influencing the diurnal pattern of HONO flux. A source analysis revealed that the unknown HONO source (Punknown) exhibited a diurnal pattern with higher daytime and lower nighttime values. Sensitivity tests demonstrated that photo-enhanced NO2 conversion on the ground could adequately explain Punknown, while nocturnal HONO production derived from soil emission fluxes (ranging from 0.32 to 0.79 ppbv h−1) could sufficiently elucidate nighttime Punknown values. Our study emphasized the variability in HONO fluxes across various agricultural-management activities, as well as the importance of heterogeneous NO2 conversion on ground surfaces and soil emissions in HONO production."

In this study, we use a technique called “double-moment normalization” to model the distribution of diameter sizes. The parameters of the method have been defined over 70 % of the dataset and tested over the remaining 30 %. An independent distribution of hail sizes, collected by a drone, has also been used to evaluate the method. 
 Measurements of hailstone diameters and kinetic energy, collected by the Swiss network of automatic hail sensors, are available in three regions of Switzerland for the period between September 2018 and August 2023. In this study, we propose the use of double-moment normalization for modeling the hail size number distribution (HSND), which is defined as the number of hailstone impacts measured, for each diameter size, by one instrument during one hail event. This method uses two of the empirical moments of the HSND to compute a normalized distribution. While the HSND is dependent on the duration and intensity of the event and on the detection area of the sensor, we show that the normalized distribution has limited variability across the three geographical regions of deployment of the sensors. Thanks to its invariance in space and time, a generalized gamma function is used to model the normalized distribution, and its parameters have been determined through a fit over approximately 70 % of the events. The fitted model and the previously chosen pair of empirical moments can be used to reconstruct the HSND at any location in Switzerland. The accuracy of the reconstruction has been estimated over the remaining 30 % of the dataset. An additional evaluation has been performed on an independent HSND, made of estimates of hail diameters measured by drone photogrammetry during a single event. This HSND has a much larger number of hailstone impacts (18 000) than those of the hail sensor events (from 30 to 400). The double-moment normalization is able to reproduce well the HSND recorded by the hail sensors and the drone, albeit with an underestimation of the number of impacts at small diameters. These results highlight the invariance of the normalized distribution and the adaptability of the method to different data sources."

Results show that Jostedalsbreen currently (~2020) has a maximum ice thickness of ~630 m, a mean ice thickness of 154 ± 22 m and an ice volume of 70.6 ±10.2 km3. Ice of less than 50 m thickness covers two narrow regions of Jostedalsbreen, and the ice cap is likely to separate into three parts in a warming climate. 
 We present an extensive dataset of ice thickness measurements from Jostedalsbreen ice cap, mainland Europe's largest glacier. The dataset consists of more than 351 000 point values of ice thickness distributed along ∼ 1100 km profile segments that cover most of the ice cap. Ice thickness was measured during field campaigns in 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023 using various ground-penetrating radar (GPR) systems with frequencies ranging between 2.5 and 500 MHz. A large majority of the ice thickness observations were collected in spring using either snowmobiles (90 %) or a helicopter-based radar system (8 %), while summer measurements were carried out on foot (2 %). To ensure accessibility and ease of use, metadata were attributed following the GlaThiDa dataset (GlaThiDa Consortium, 2020) and follow the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) guiding principles. Our findings show that glacier ice of more than 400 m thickness is found in the upper regions of large outlet glaciers, with a maximum ice thickness of ∼ 630 m in the accumulation area of Tunsbergdalsbreen. Thin ice of less than 50 m covers narrow regions joining the central part of Jostedalsbreen with its northern and southern parts, making the ice cap vulnerable to break-up with future climate warming. Using the point values of ice thickness as input to an ice thickness model, we computed 10 m grids of ice thickness and bed topography that cover the entire ice cap. From these distributed datasets, we find that Jostedalsbreen (458 km2 in 2019) has a present (∼ 2020) mean ice thickness of 154 ± 22 m and an ice volume of 70.6 ± 10.2 km3. Locations of depressions in the map of bed topography are used to delineate potential future lakes, consequently providing a glimpse of the landscape if the entire Jostedalsbreen melts away. Together, the comprehensive ice thickness point values and ice-cap-wide grids serve as a baseline for future climate change impact studies at Jostedalsbreen.

Observations exist to address this problem, and mathematics and different computing tools can be used to predict histories of flow. We explore how modeling choices impact calculated vertical deflections. The sensitivity of vertical motions at Earth's surface to deep flow is assessed, demonstrating how surface observations can enlighten flow histories. 
 The modern state of the mantle and its evolution on geological timescales are of widespread importance for the Earth sciences. For instance, it is generally agreed that mantle flow is manifest in topographic and drainage network evolution, glacio-eustasy, and  the distribution of sediments. There are now a variety of theoretical approaches to predict histories of mantle convection and its impact on surface deflections. A general goal is to make use of observed deflections to identify Earth-like simulations and constrain the history of mantle convection. Several important insights into the role of radial and non-radial viscosity variations, gravitation, and the importance of shallow structure already exist. Here we seek to bring those insights into a single framework to elucidate the relative importance of popular modeling choices for predicted instantaneous vertical surface deflections. We start by comparing results from numeric and analytic approaches to solving the equations of motion that are ostensibly parameterized to be as similar as possible. Deflections predicted by such numeric and analytic models can vary by ∼ 10 %, and the difference increases to ∼ 25 % when viscosity is temperature-dependent. Including self-gravitation and the gravitational potential of the deflected surface is a relatively small source of discrepancy. However, spherical harmonic correlations between model predictions decrease dramatically with the removal of shallow structure to increasing depths and when radial viscosity structure is modified. The results emphasize the sensitivity of instantaneous surface deflections to density and viscosity anomalies in the upper mantle. They reinforce the view that a detailed understanding of lithospheric structure is crucial for relating mantle convective history to observations of vertical motions at Earth's surface."

This study examines how global soil N2O emissions have changed from 1961 to 2020 and identifies key factors driving these changes using an ecological model. The findings highlight croplands as the largest source, with factors like fertilizer use and climate change enhancing emissions. Rising CO2 levels, however, can partially mitigate N2O emissions through increased plant nitrogen uptake. 
 Nitrogen (N) transformation processes by soil microbes account for significant nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from natural ecosystems and cropland. However, understanding and quantifying global soil N2O emissions and their responses to changing environmental conditions remain challenging. We implemented a soil nitrification-denitrification module into the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to estimate N2O emissions from global lands. The performance of this new development is examined using observed N2O fluxes from natural soil and cropland field trials, and independent global-scale estimates. LPJ-GUESS broadly reproduces the cumulative N2O emissions under different climate conditions and N fertilizer applications that are observed in the field experiments, with some deviations in emission seasonality. Globally, simulated soil N2O emissions from terrestrial ecosystems increase from 5.6±0.2 Tg N yr-1 in the 1960s to 9.9±0.3 Tg N yr-1 in the 2010s, with croplands contributing about two thirds of the total increase. East Asia and South Asia show the fastest growth rates in N2O emissions over the study period due to the expansion of fertilized croplands. On a global scale, N fertilization (including synthetic fertilizer and manure use), atmospheric N deposition, and climate change contribute 58 %, 46 %, and 24 %, respectively, to the simulated soil N2O emissions in the 2010s. Rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere reduce the simulated emissions by 32 % through increased plant N uptake, whereas land-use changes have varied spatial effects on emissions depending on N management intensity after land-cover conversion. Our estimates only account for the direct soil N2O emissions, excluding those from fertilized pasture. This study highlights the importance of environmental factors in influencing global soil N2O emissions, particularly for assessing greenhouse gas mitigation potential in agricultural ecosystems."

Westervelt,Monitoring of PM2.5 Using Well-Calibrated Low-Cost Sensors over One Year in Burkina Faso,"Air pollution causes more than 8.34 million premature deaths worldwide. Most of these deaths occur in the Global South, particularly in Africa. However, the means of observing this air pollution in these countries are lacking. Knowledge of pollutant concentration levels and their distribution in time and space is inadequate or nonexistent in most African countries. This study focuses on the temporal and spatial distribution of PM2.5 in Burkina Faso, a country of more than 22 million residents yet with very scarce air pollution literature. The study used Clarity low-cost sensors. The sensors were placed at 19 sites throughout the country, including 13 in Ouagadougou, the capital, and three in Bobo-Dioulasso and three in Koudougou, the second and third largest cities in Burkina Faso, respectively. The measurements were taken over a one year period (November 2021 to November 2022). The data was corrected using a Gaussian Mixture Regression trained on a 2-month colocation of a TEOM with a Clarity monitor in Ouagadougou. The corrected mean daily concentrations measured at all of the sites ranged from 17 to 68 μg/m3, with an overall daily average of 46.7 μg/m3. The city averages are 48.5 μg/m3 for Ouagadougou, 46.9 μg/m3 for Bobo-Dioulasso, and 38.7 μg/m3 for Koudougou. These concentrations are significantly higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended safe daily guideline, 15 μg/m3. Measurement values are highest during the dry season, which is dominated by the Harmattan winds from the Sahara desert. At all sites, between 61% and 87% of the measured days exceeded the WHO daily guidelines for PM2.5. These measurements show the need to undertake an action plan to reduce air pollution in general in Burkina Faso in order to better protect the population health."

Then, we compare our findings to Earth's REB using contemporary satellite data sets. Each planet exhibits remarkably distinct seasonal REB distributions due to differences in their orbital, atmospheric, and surface properties. Annually, Earth's REB exhibits a tropical energy surplus and a deficit at the poles. In contrast, Mars' annual REB displays an inverted meridional distribution with significant hemispheric asymmetry. Additionally, global dust storms significantly modify the Martian REB.

Earthquake‐triggered landslides are a severe hazard and contribute to landscape evolution. To understand their process and controlling factors, we model the onset of seismically‐triggered slip on pre‐existing slip surfaces governed by laboratory‐based rate‐and‐state friction, including wave propagation effects. Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we identify how friction properties, landslide thickness and incident wave attributes (frequency, duration, amplitude) control slope stability. We find that the frictional state variable tracks the cyclic fatigue of the slip surface, its progressive weakening with each wave cycle. Wave propagation effects introduce two regimes depending on frequency relative to the two‐way travel time across the landslide thickness: the stability criterion is well approximated by a threshold on incident peak acceleration at low frequencies, and on peak velocity at high frequencies. We derive analytical approximations, validated by simulations, suitable to apply the model to evaluate landslide stability under arbitrary input motions."

To fill this knowledge gap, we present cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages of cobbles from the surface of a moraine situated between Thwaites and Pope glaciers. We infer that the moraine formed and stabilized in the Late Holocene (∼1.4 ka) when a small glacier thickened. We also present a novel reconstruction of WAIS volume constrained by sea‐level data, which demonstrates that moraine formation coincided with a large‐scale WAIS readvance.

This study investigates the inter‐model spread in the projection of winter Central Asian precipitation (WCAP) using models from the Coupled Model Inter‐comparison Project Phase 6. The results reveal a homogenous wetting trend in WCAP, with the primary source of uncertainty in its magnitude stemming from the dynamic component of vertical moisture advection. This dynamical uncertainty is further attributed to an out‐of‐phase variation between two Eurasian westerly jets, which can enhance the upward motion over Central Asia through positive relative vorticity advection and warm temperature advection. The opposing variation between two westerly jets can be traced to cooling in the North Pacific, which alters jet intensity through changes in the meridional temperature gradient.

However, the effectiveness and cost‐efficiency of large‐scale forest restoration projects (FRP) in different climatic zones, and the trade‐off between carbon sequestration and water consumption caused by FRP are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive examination of 2,778 counties in China, where the world's most ambitious FRP was executed during the past two decades. Results showed that, on average, each square kilometer of FRP yielded an additional 0.6 square kilometers of forests and contributed an extra 1354.9 tC to forest carbon storage, with the aridity index emerging as a key influencer. The actual expenditure incurred per ton of increased forest carbon storage amounted to approximately 118.9 USD in average, with the lowest in Southwest at 50.9 USD. The expansion of forest cover and enhanced biomass storage led to a notable increase in water consumption, and the trade‐off was particularly pronounced in arid regions. Our study provides empirical evidence that FRP is an effective and cost‐efficient climate change mitigation strategy for humid climate zones under current carbon prices. However, FRP is not cost‐efficient in semi‐arid and arid regions.

Environmental benefits and risks may be interactively and inequitably distributed across different populations in cities, and these patterns may change over time. Here, we assess the spatial distribution of environmental risks and benefits in pairs, considering synergies and trade‐offs, in an illustrative metropolitan area (Metro Vancouver) in Canada in the years 2006 and 2016. We classify census dissemination areas as sweet, sour, risky, or medium spots based on relative exposures for six environmental combinations: Walkability and NO2; heat stress and NO2; vegetation coverage and NO2; vegetation coverage and heat stress; walkability and accessibility to natural recreational areas; and heat stress and accessibility to natural recreational areas. We evaluate whether different population groups are disproportionately exposed to lower environmental quality based on linear regressions and other metrics. We find that while performance for individual environmental variables improved over the decade, considering their combinations, sweet spots became sweeter and sour spots became sourer. Residents with high material and social deprivation and visible minorities were disproportionately exposed to lower environmental quality in both years for most of the environmental combinations. Further, we find that these inequities were not improving over time for all groups: for instance, South Asian residents in the region faced higher disproportionate burdens or diminished access to benefits in 2016, as compared to 2006. Given these findings, we suggest considerations of cumulative exposure in prioritizing areas for intervention, targeting the sour and risky spots persistently experienced by overburdened populations."

Here the authors show that microRNA 9 mediates the formation of G-quadruplexes and the looping of promoters and super-enhancers in genes activated by transforming growth factor beta 1signaling. 
 The dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization are essential to transcriptional regulation. While enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene expression, chromatin looping is a means for enhancer-promoter interactions yielding cell-type-specific gene expression. Further, non-canonical DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), are related to increased gene expression. However, the role of G4s in promoter-distal regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), and in chromatin looping has remained elusive.

 Antarctic sea ice extent has seen a slight increase over recent decades, yet since 2016, it has undergone a sharp decline, reaching record lows. While the precise impact of anthropogenic forcing remains uncertain, natural fluctuations have been shown to be important for this variability. Our study employs a series of coupled model experiments, revealing that with constant anthropogenic forcing, the primary driver of interannual sea ice variability lies in deep convection within the Southern Ocean, although it is model dependent. However, as anthropogenic forcing increases, the influence of deep convection weakens, and the Southern Annular Mode, an atmospheric intrinsic variability, plays a more significant role in the sea ice fluctuations owing to the shift from a zonal wavenumber-three pattern observed in the historical period. These model results indicate that surface air-sea interaction will play a more prominent role in Antarctic sea ice variability in the future.

 Ammonia volatilized from penguin excreta is a significant nitrogen source in Antarctic ecosystems, influencing climate through new particle formation (NPF). Freeze-thaw events can trigger ammonia emissions, but their impact on penguin-derived ammonia is understudied and overlooked in models. Here we investigate the contribution of penguins to ammonia and their climatic impacts using cruise observations and GEOS-Chem-APM simulations. High ammonia concentrations, with a maximum exceeding 7000 ng/m3, were observed over the Southern Ocean and Prydz Bay, driven by air masses from penguin colonies. Simulations showed that incorporating freeze-thaw impact improves model performance, with penguin-derived ammonia emissions enhanced by up to 20-fold and reaching a total of 49 Gg across Antarctica in November. Elevated ammonia increased simulated secondary particle number concentrations by 30−300% through NPF, enhancing simulated cloud droplet number concentrations by 10−20% and altering cloud properties.

 Analysis of a suite of global climate model projections under symmetric CO2 ramp-up and ramp-down (RD) scenarios, our results demonstrate a progressive strengthening of the western North Pacific anticyclone (WNPAC) with rising CO2 concentrations, a trend that persists as CO2 declines, followed by gradual recovery without fully returning to its initial state when CO2 concentrations restore. The overshoot of the WNPAC in the CO2 RD phase is highly correlated with the enhanced anomalous Maritime Continent (MC) convection, which influences WNPAC through reinforced Kelvin wave response or local Hadley circulation adjustment. This enhanced convection is attributed to increased Indo-Pacific zonal SST gradient associated with strengthened MC warming and accelerated decay of El Niño in the Central Pacific, ultimately linked to climatological equatorial Pacific El Niño-like warming pattern-related air-sea processes. The overshoot of the WNPAC during the CO2 RD phase may exacerbate flood and high temperature risks in densely populated East Asia."

These wildfires caused a record number of evacuations, unprecedented air quality impacts across Canada and the northeastern United States, and substantial strain on fire management resources. Using climate models, we show that human-induced climate change significantly increased the likelihood of area burned at least as large as in 2023 across most of Canada, with more than two-fold increases in the east and southwest. The long fire season was more than five times as likely and the large areas across Canada experiencing synchronous extreme fire weather were also much more likely due to human influence on the climate.

 Understanding changes in global ocean heat content (OHC) is essential for investigating Earth’s energy imbalance and climate change. OHC trends are assessed using four state-of-the-art ocean reanalyses and one objective analysis. The spatial OHC trend patterns captured by reanalyses are consistent with each other, but sensitive to the selected time period. A higher proportion of heat uptake in the 100–2000 m sub-surface layer over 2001–2010 than 1994–2000 contributed to the temporary slowdown in global surface warming. The North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and heat transport show better agreement with RAPID observations compared with previous studies. Zonal mean OHC trends in the North Atlantic over 40–60 °N differ for the MOC increasing (2000–2004) and decreasing periods (2005–2010) and OHC increases are more concentrated between 30 and 40 °N in the later MOC increasing period (2011–2022).

 Built-up heights serve as a nexus in understanding the complex relationship between urban forms and socioeconomic activities. With the advent of remote sensing technology, built-up height mapping from satellite observations has become available over the past years. However, the absence of high-precision sample data poses a significant limitation to built-up height mapping at large (regional or global) scales, particularly in developing regions. To address this issue, we proposed a flexible mapping framework to derive precise building height samples using the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data for built-up height estimation. First, we calculated building heights from ICESat-2 photons using advanced algorithms such as Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) linear fitting and cloth simulation filtering. Then, we constructed large-scale built-up height samples by aggregating the height information into grid cells with optimal size. Finally, aided by these grids with height information from ICEsat-2 and other satellite observations from Sentinel data as well as the digital surface model (DSM), we mapped built-up heights in two mega-cities (i.e., New York and Shenzhen) using the random forest regression model. Our results demonstrate building height estimation using ICESat-2 data generally exhibits in relation to other studies high accuracy, showing great potential to support large-scale built-up height mapping using satellite observations. We found the optimal grid size for built-up height mapping is around 300 m, after a comprehensive sensitivity analysis regarding the building fraction within the grid and its size. Overall, the mapped built-up heights are reliable, with relatively low mean absolute errors (MAE) of 2.69 m in New York and 3.87 m in Shenzhen, similar to or better than previous studies. By leveraging high-precision elevation data provided by the ICESat-2 data, our proposed approach can effectively collect samples in regions with limited information on building heights, showing great potential for large-scale built-up height monitoring and supporting future urban studies."

 Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing has become an important tool to study human activities and their impact on the environment.

To achieve this, we develop a conversion model from radiance to radiant flux based on the SNPP-VIIRS dataset and calculate the global radiant flux map for 2022. A validation of the model was conducted in 50 representative cities worldwide, confirming its rationality and accuracy. The use of radiant flux provides a more intuitive reflection of NTL energy intensity and eliminates system error caused by variations in pixel areas. This research emphasizes the importance of using a quantitative measurement for NTL and highlights the potential for further evaluation of socio-economic parameters and ecological impacts using NTL radiant flux."

 Mangroves, critical for ecological sustainability, are challenging to map accurately due to their fragmented nature and difficult accessibility. Existing datasets, often constrained to 10 m or above resolutions, could misrepresent fragmented mangrove regions and suffer from sampling biases, limiting their regional applicability. Furthermore, scale conversion’s spatial and statistical implications on mangrove mapping accuracy and area estimation remain largely unexplored. This study proposes a novel framework that leverages UHR (0.2 m) aerial photos and the DeepLabV3+ model for fine-scale mapping and systematically simulates and quantifies scale-induced effects. The resultant 20 cm-resolution mangrove map of Hong Kong achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.1 %, with up to 53 % improvement compared to various existing datasets. It delineates complex boundaries in diverse coastal settings while preserving the structural integrity of fragmented patches. The total mangrove area in Hong Kong is estimated at ∼720 ha, with Deep Bay comprising 77.5 %. The scale effects analysis revealed pronounced sensitivity in fragmented habitats, where each 1 m increase in resolution could result in an average area underestimation of 5000 m2 and up to 25 % OA degradation when transitioning from 0.2 m to 30 m. Moreover, integrating patch geometry and scale responses indicated that 6 m is the optimal scale for monitoring. Beyond this, OA could sharply decline to below 82 % at the commonly used 10 m resolution and drop as low as 66 % at 30 m. These findings highlight the critical importance of fine-scale mapping using UHR images for effective mangrove conservation and management."

 Air pollution affects the health of people and therefore monitoring of the air quality is important both for the public and policy makers. Efficient monitoring of air quality requires a combination of measurements and modelling. Both current and annual average concentrations as well as future concentrations on all locations where people live are required. This information on exposure to pollutants can only be achieved at high spatial resolution at all locations by using air-quality models. Therefore, model calibration is a major objective in air quality measurement strategies. Measurement results of reference instruments (or equivalent) as defined in the EU air quality directive offer a high-quality basis for model calibration and validation. Over the last years, low-cost sensors/samplers have shown a rapid development and promising results. In this paper, a statistical framework is presented to evaluate measurement strategies that apply a combination of reference measurement instruments and low-cost measurements, like diffusion tubes and sensors. For some practical situations the introduction of sensors at only twenty locations gives a significant improvement of the calibration of an air quality model. The calibration of the low-cost measurements themselves with respect to the reference instruments is critical for any application. This calibration largely determines the model quality improvement due to the addition of low-cost measurements. The results shown in this paper can be used to optimize measurement strategy using low-cost measurements and/or sensors with established performance characteristics. The results can also be used to define the quality of the low-cost measurements that is required for useful applications. Using low-cost measurements can improve the quality of the calibrated model, even with a simultaneous reduction of the number of reference instruments.

Results showed that NH3 played a critical role in NO3− formation, with average NH3 concentrations of 6.7 ± 3.6 μg m−3. NO3− was the most abundant secondary inorganic aerosol throughout the study, especially during PM2.5 episodes (hourly PM2.5 ≥ 50 μg m−3), demonstrating a strong correlation between excess-NH4+ and NO3− concentrations. A sensitivity analysis using the ISORROPIA-II model revealed that reducing the pH of PM2.5 below 3.0 effectively decreased the gas-particle partitioning ratio of total nitrate, emphasizing the importance of total ammonia control. Specifically, ∼65% reduction in TNH3 reduced particulate NO3− concentrations by ∼20% in winter and ∼34% in autumn, with more pronounced effects during high PM2.5 alerts.

Compared to observational rainfall data from the Climatic Research Unit, the selected models showed similar spatial patterns for mean and extreme rainfall in the historical period with regional biases across CMIP6 selected models, mainly in the monsoonal regions such as the west coast, central India, the Himalayas and its foothills, and the northeastern regions. Four EC-Earth models accurately projected mean and extreme rainfall for central India, the southern west coast, and the western Himalayan regions, while NorESM slightly overestimated central India and underestimated) west coast extremes. Moreover, the selected models are not adequate to realistically capture the extremes in northeastern and Myanmar coastal areas. Future scenarios predict significant changes in extreme rainfall over central India and the rain shadow regions of southeast India. The increased ERE in the northern regions of the west coast and southwestern regions of central India could lead to increased vulnerabilities in the area, especially in higher forcing scenarios. Moreover, the zone of extreme rainfall is projected the expansion of the rain shadow regions to the leeward side of the Western Ghats, particularly in the SSP5–8.5 scenario."

We examined bone loss and recovery in 17 astronauts using time-lapsed high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and biochemical markers to determine whether disuse-induced changes are permanent. During 6 months in microgravity, resorption was threefold higher than formation. Upon return to Earth, targeted bone formation occurred in high mechanical strain areas, with 31.8% of bone formed in the first 6 months after flight at sites resorbed during spaceflight, significantly higher than the 2.7% observed 6 to 12 months after return. Limited bone recovery at resorption sites after 6 months on Earth indicates a restricted window for reactivating bone remodeling factors in humans. Incomplete skeletal recovery may arise from these arrested remodeling sites, representing potential targets for new interventions, thus providing means to counteract this long-term health risk for astronauts."

While flexible strain sensors facilitate real-time monitoring with shape-adaptive properties, their sensitivity is generally lower than spectroscopic imaging methods. Crack-based strain sensors achieve enhanced sensitivity with gauge factors (GFs) exceeding 30,000; however, such GFs are only attainable at large strains exceeding several percent and decline below 10 for strains under 10−3, rendering them inadequate for minute deformations.

These sensors achieve remarkable GFs surpassing 1000 at strains of 10−4on substrates with a Poisson’s ratio of −0.9. The crack orientation–independent gap-widening behavior elucidates the origin of hypersensitivity, corroborated by simplified models and finite element analysis.

Overfitted models showed significantly lower TAVAC scores. TAVAC also distinguishes off-target from on-target attentions and measures interpretation generalization at a fine-grained cellular level. Beyond diagnostics, TAVAC enhances interpretative reproducibility in basic research, revealing critical spatial patterns and cellular structures of biomedical and other general nonbiomedical images."

Human eyelashes, the primary protector of eyes, use a yet-to-be-fully-understood mechanism to efficiently transfer incoming liquid for vision safeguarding. Here, we elucidate that human eyelashes featuring a hydrophobic curved flexible fiber array with surface micro-ratchet and macro-curvature approximating theBrachistochroneis adept at directionally and rapidly expelling incoming liquid to maintain clear vision. These structural attributes are sequentially used for liquid drainage, starting from anisotropic retention via micro-ratchet, followed by the elastic expulsion among deflected hydrophobic flexible fiber arrays and culminating in the fastest sliding off along aBrachistochronepath, which together reduce the contact time by about 20% of that on rigid linear slopes. Investigating the intricate relationship between multistructure and draining efficiency of human eyelashes may inspire the design of advanced liquid-repelling edges on outdoor devices to maintain dryness."

At the nanoscale, sharply focused structured light carries coupled spin-orbital angular momenta with complex 3D nearfield structures, crucial for manipulating multidimensional information of light in nanophotonics. However, characterizing these interactions faces challenges with conventional farfield–based methods, which typically lack the essential accuracy and resolution to interrogate the structured nearfield with high fidelity. To address this challenge, we experimentally observe spin-orbit interactions at the nanoscale using photoinduced force microscopy. Such interactions are enabled through sharply focused circularly polarized optical vortices, which are then mapped by nearfield optical forces in high resolution. Because the optical forces can reveal both longitudinal and transverse nearfield structures with high fidelity, the spin-orbit interactions are eventually evaluated quantitatively at the nearfield, as an important inspiration to use the coupled momenta in dense optical nano-device systems."

Furthermore, we find that, globally, average glacial erosion rates exceed fluvial erosion rates through time by an order of magnitude, and that this difference cannot be explained by Sadlerian biases or by variations in hillslope, precipitation, or latitude.
