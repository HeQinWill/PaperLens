10.5194/acp-25-16233-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注热带海洋上空的积云动力学，特别是中尺度组织对积云 updraft 的影响。论文通过船舶观测对比了不同组织程度的积云，发现组织性更强的积云在垂直水汽输送方面效率更高。研究结果对理解积云如何影响气候反馈以及提高全球气候模型的准确性具有重要意义。虽然该研究与大气有关，但它侧重于云的动力学和气候影响，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['trade wind cumuli', 'cloud dynamics', 'mesoscale organization', 'updrafts', 'moisture transport', 'climate feedback', 'global climate models']",Isabel L. McCoy;Sunil Baidar;Paquita Zuidema;Jan Kazil;W. Alan Brewer;Wayne M. Angevine;Graham Feingold,Increased dynamic efficiency in mesoscale organized trade wind cumulus clouds,"We use ship observations to investigate the dynamics of small clouds over the tropical oceans. When these cumulus clouds cluster together, they more efficiently move moisture into the cloud layer due to strengthened updrafts. This encourages further clustering, increases local cloud development success, and may help sustain clouds against diurnal variations in their environment. These results have implications for cumulus feedback on the climate, a significant uncertainty in future projections. 
 Mesoscale organization of boundary layer clouds modulates their radiative properties and contributes to the tropical hydrologic cycle. Trade wind cumuli (Cu) have varying organization and are a source of uncertainty in global climate models (GCMs). The linkage between Cu development and dynamics is difficult to capture, impacting low cloud feedback estimates. We investigate the relationship between mesoscale organization and Cu updraft dynamics in their early development stages using wintertime shipborne observations. We contrast two periods with similar cloud sizes but more (MO) and less (LO) organized states. MO clouds are dynamically more efficient than LO clouds: for a given core size, MO clouds have stronger sub-cloud and cloud-base updrafts, implying greater vertical moisture transport. Despite similar background plume behaviors, cloud-topped plumes are wider and more frequently successful for MO than LO. Updraft strength is persistent despite diurnal environmental variations. MO turbulence is enhanced by early-morning surface flux maximization and LO updrafts may be assisted by daytime environmental conditions. MO cloud amount persists, while LO clouds suffer daytime depredations. We hypothesize that, once established, MO clouds are maintained through the assistance of cloud-layer-driven mesoscale circulations that increase dynamic efficiency through reinforcing plumes and their updrafts. Dynamic efficiency is likely a key contributor to the moisture–convection feedback critical to mesoscale organization. Organizational modulation of cloud dynamics through enhancing updrafts is another unresolved factor in GCM parameterizations. Understanding this efficiency, and the potential environmental resilience of MO clouds, will be informative for simulating Cu behaviors under current and future climates."
10.5194/acp-25-16287-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了晴空和多云天气下美国地区NO2浓度的差异，以及这种差异对卫星测量应用的影响。研究对比了地表观测、气象再分析数据、卫星测量数据（TROPOMI和TEMPO）以及模型模拟结果，以量化NO2浓度在不同天气条件下的差异。研究发现，多云天气下的地表NO2浓度通常高于晴空天气，尤其是在美国东北部地区。论文还探讨了模型模拟与实际观测的差异，并分析了可能的原因。最后，论文利用地表NO2数据与TEMPO卫星数据进行匹配，发现NO2浓度在晴空和多云条件下的差异在下午比上午更大。这项研究旨在量化仅使用晴空数据进行卫星测量时引入的偏差。,"['NO2 concentration', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite measurements', 'TROPOMI', 'TEMPO', 'Clear-sky conditions', 'Cloudy-sky conditions', 'Atmospheric composition analysis']",Daniel L. Goldberg;M. Omar Nawaz;Congmeng Lyu;Jian He;Annmarie G. Carlton;Shobha Kondragunta;Susan C. Anenberg,Clear-sky and cloudy-sky differences in NO2 concentrations over the United States:  implications for satellite measurement  applications,"This research investigates how air quality, specifically NO2 concentrations, is different under clear and cloudy skies. We find that in situ surface NO2 is, on average, +36 % larger during cloudy days versus clear sky days, with a wide distribution based on geographic region and roadway proximity: largest in the Northeast U.S. and smallest in the Southwest U.S. and near major roadways. This has implications for satellite data applications, which only use measurements in the absence of clouds. 
 Satellite measurements of tropospheric trace gases are often only used when there are few clouds, which screens out 20 %–70 % of the data, depending on geographic region. Although clouds cause satellite data gaps, in situ surface measurements and model simulations can provide insight on NO2 during cloudy conditions. Here, we intercompare surface observations, meteorological reanalysis (ERA5), satellite measurements (TROPOMI and TEMPO), and a model (WRF-Chem) during 2019 over the contiguous US to quantify how NO2 concentrations differ under clear and cloudy skies. We find that in situ surface NO2 measurements are, on average, +17 % larger on all days compared to clear-sky days and +36 % larger during cloudy days versus clear-sky days, with a wide distribution based on geographic region and roadway proximity: largest in the Northeast US and smallest in the Southwest US and near major roadways. WRF-Chem simulated surface NO2 between cloudy and clear conditions is larger than the observed differences: +59 % on cloudy days vs. clear-sky days for the model. We additionally find modeled jNO2 values are reasonable, suggesting this WRF-Chem NO2 bias could be arising from overly rapid OH removal of NO2 in sunlight, too slow NOz regeneration of NO2 in sunlight, or differing boundary layer depth biases under cloudy versus clear skies. Finally, using in situ NO2 matched to provisional TEMPO data, we find the NO2 differences between cloudy and clear conditions to be larger in the afternoon than morning. This study quantifies some of the biases in satellite measurements introduced by using only clear-sky data."

Harrison,Black carbon aerosols in China: spatial-temporal variations and lessons from long-term atmospheric observations,"This study analyzes 13 years of BC (black carbon) data in China, uncovering patterns in its concentration and sources. Spatial-temporal variations and trends of BC are reported. Our analysis revealed that the reduction rates of BC and its sources varied across different station types, with spatial differences in the drivers of reduction. These long-term observations provide valuable insights to enhance understanding of pollution trends and improve models for predicting air quality. 
 Black carbon (BC) significantly influences climate, air quality, and public health, and long-term observations are essential for understanding its adverse effects. While previous studies have primarily focused on spatiotemporal variations, deeper insights from such datasets remain uncovered. Using 13 years (2008–2020) of continuous measurements of equivalent black carbon (eBC) in China, this study reported the spatial-temporal variations of eBC and its sources, including solid fuel (eBCsf) and liquid fuel combustion (eBClf). The results showed that eBC and its sources exhibited higher concentrations in eastern and northern China compared to western and southern China. Seasonal variations of eBC and eBCsf generally showed lower values during summer and higher values during winter at most stations. Long-term trends indicated that eBC and eBClf decreased most rapidly at urban stations, while eBCsf declined faster at rural stations. Comparisons of eBC concentrations and trends between this study and global observations revealed higher eBC levels but lower reduction rates in China. These long-term observations showed that the model simulations performed well in simulating spatial distribution but poorly in capturing inter-annual variations. The weather-normalized eBC concentrations showed potential for adjusting emission estimates. The normalized results also suggested that emission control was the dominant driver of the BC reduction. This decrease was primarily driven by reductions from solid fuel combustion at rural and background stations. This study provides insights for reducing uncertainties in black carbon emission inventories and improving model performance in simulating surface concentrations."

This approach captures the character of the tropopause remarkably well, both in individual vertical profiles and in long-term averages, providing a consistent and physically meaningful representation of the transition between the troposphere and the stratosphere. 
 The tropopause represents a central feature of the atmospheric vertical structure, marking the transition between the troposphere and stratosphere. While common definitions rely on quantities conserved under adiabatic changes, diabatic effects, resulting from radiation, cloud processes or turbulence are also decisive for the tropopause structure. Therefore, we propose a new definition based on the vertical gradient of the relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi). RHi is the key variable for ice cloud formation and incorporates both diabatic and adiabatic processes. Based on high-resolution radiosonde data, we can show that our RHi-GT-based definition is generally consistent with, and often provides a clearer characterization than the thermal tropopause. This is not only evident in individual vertical profiles, but also when looking at statistics of many profiles with a tropopause-relative height axis. Last but not least, the robust and simple calculation of our definition makes it an ideal tool for studies involving the tropopause."
10.5194/acp-25-16331-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注2022年北京冬奥会期间北京城市大气中N2O5浓度的变化及其环境影响。通过比较奥运会前后污染物的水平，评估了减排对夜间化学的影响。研究结果表明，一氧化氮（NO）和挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）与NO3的反应性降低，N2O5的非均相吸收在夜间硝酸盐的形成中起着关键作用。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它对大气成分（如N2O5、NO3、NO2、O3和VOCs）的分析，以及对空气质量监测和减排影响的评估，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。遥感数据可以用于验证和补充地面观测结果，从而更全面地了解城市大气污染的特征和变化趋势。,"['N2O5', 'NO3', 'NO2', 'O3', 'VOCs', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Atmospheric Composition Analysis', 'Emission Reduction Impact']",Tiantian Zhang;Peng Zuo;Yi Chen;Tong Liu;Linghan Zeng;Weili Lin;Chunxiang Ye,Measurement report: Variations and environmental impacts of atmospheric N2O5 concentrations in urban Beijing during the 2022 Winter Olympics,"During the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, we conducted field observations of N2O5. By comparing pre- and post-Olympic pollutant levels, we evaluated the impact of emission reductions on nocturnal chemistry. The results showed that the reactivity of nitric oxide (NO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with NO3 decreased, and that the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 played a critical role in nocturnal nitrate formation. 
 The chemistry of nitrate radical (NO3) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) plays a pivotal role in tropospheric nighttime chemistry. Given their close linkage to precursor variations, emission reduction during the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics likely affected NO3 and N2O5 behavior. In this study, we measured N2O5, NO2, O3, etc. during and after the Olympics, and compared pollutant levels as well as the contributions of reaction pathways to the loss of NO3 and N2O5. Throughout the entire observation period, NO3 production rate averaged 0.5 ± 0.4 ppbv h−1, and the N2O5 mixing ratio could reach up to 875 pptv within 1 min, indicating their active production. The relatively long nighttime N2O5 lifetime (τN2O5), with an average of 11.9 ± 11.8 min, suggested a slow N2O5 loss rate during winter season. Despite low NO mixing ratio (below 3 ppbv), it dominated NO3 loss (79.0 %). VOCs oxidation contributed 0.2 %, primarily driven by styrene. During the Olympics, emission reductions led to decreased NO and VOCs, which in turn reduced their reaction with NO3. The heterogeneous uptake of N2O5, another key NO3 loss pathway – accounted for 20.8 % of NO3 loss during the Olympics, but this contribution decreased to 10.6 % after the Olympics. This uptake is crucial for nighttime NO3 removal and would be essential for winter nitrate formation in urban Beijing. Our results highlight that under emission control scenarios, the relative importance of heterogeneous processes in nocturnal NO3 cycling increases, providing new insights into how emission reduction measures shape nighttime oxidation processes in polluted urban environments."

Our results show that air pollution by particles has clearly decreased, mainly due to lower emissions, while total ozone levels show signs of slow recovery. The rising height of the tropopause, linked to climate change, was found to influence ozone amounts in opposite ways. 
 Long-term observations (1993–2024) of total column ozone (TCO) and aerosol optical depth at 320 nm (AOD320) from the Brewer spectrophotometer at Poprad-Gánovce, Slovakia, were analysed. The data used in this study are closely tied to three environmental issues driven by human activities: ozone depletion, climate change, and air pollution caused by aerosols. Both parameters exhibit distinct seasonal variability, with AOD320 peaks in April and August and TCO maxima from February to April. AOD320 shows a statistically significant long-term decrease (−0.057 ± 0.005 per decade), reflecting reduced anthropogenic emissions. The lowest annual mean occurred in 2020, corresponding to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, TCO shows no clear trend (0.0 ± 0.4 DU per decade), whereas the tropopause height increases markedly (105 ± 7 m per decade) and exerts an inverse influence on TCO. After removing this effect, a positive TCO trend (1.3 ± 0.3 DU per decade) appears, while the tropopause-related component decreases (−1.3 ± 0.1 DU per decade). The most significant positive linear trend in tropopause height was identified in August (200 ± 70 m per decade), while the strongest negative TCO trend also occurred in August (−3.6 ± 1.8 DU per decade). Only about one third of this August TCO decrease is explained by the tropopause rise. LOTUS regression confirmed the inverse TCO-tropopause relationship and revealed significant ENSO (positive) and QBOB (negative) influences. A weak positive trend in TCO since 1997 (2.0 ± 1.2 DU) indicates ongoing recovery from ODS reductions."

We examined how different cloud layers influence satellite estimates of cloud thickness and droplet size using observations and computer simulations over China. We found that high ice clouds can hide lower water clouds, causing large errors. This shows satellites need to consider cloud layers to improve accuracy. 
 The vertical structure of clouds plays a critical role in atmospheric radiative transfer and is a major source of uncertainty in satellite-based retrievals of cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective radius (CER). Most operational algorithms assume a single homogeneous layer, but the biases introduced by this simplification under realistic multilayer conditions remain poorly quantified. This study systematically investigates how perturbations in cloud vertical structure affect COT and CER retrievals using Fengyun-4A Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (FY4A/AGRI) and simulations from Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System (ARMS) over central and eastern China during June–August 2018. We designed ten sensitivity experiments by varying water and ice content across single-, double-, and triple-layer cloud configurations to quantify the impact of structural differences on channel reflectance and the COT-CER relationship. The results indicate that upper-level ice clouds significantly mask reflectance from lower water clouds, reducing total reflectance by approximately 50 % and leading to systematic retrieval biases: single-layer algorithms underestimate COT at small CER (< 10 µm) but overestimate it by approximately 20 units under larger CER conditions. In single-layer clouds, variations in low- and mid-level water content produce mean COT increases that are ∼ 24 % larger than in double-layer structure, with similar biases occurring in three-layer clouds. Furthermore, enhanced mid-level liquid water enhances the nonlinear relationship between COT and CER, increasing retrieval uncertainties. These findings identify cloud vertical heterogeneity as a major source of retrieval bias and emphasize the necessity of integrating multilayer cloud information into satellite retrieval algorithms."

Urban OA was enriched in aromatic species, while seaside OA featured aliphatic and highly oxidized compounds. Marine-derived humid air masses promoted aqueous/heterogeneous phase OA formation, leading to a higher oxidation state. 
 Organic aerosol (OA), as a key component of particulate matter, exerts significant impacts on public health and the environment. However, understanding of molecular characterization of OA under diverse environments remains limited. This study employed offline FIGAERO-I-CIMS (Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosols coupled with iodide-adduct Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry) to analyze the molecular composition of OA in PM2.5 samples collected from a coastal city (urban and seaside sites) in Southeast China during spring 2024. A total of 737 and 768 CHOX compounds were identified at the urban and seaside sites, respectively. CHO compounds dominated in signal intensity (>70 %) at both sites, while CHON were more abundant at the urban site and S-containing compounds at the seaside site. The weighted effective oxygen to carbon content (Oeff/C) ratios (urban 0.82, seaside 0.85) indicated the highly oxidized nature of coastal compounds. Seaside CHOX exhibited lower unsaturation, reduced aromaticity, and higher oxidation states. Categorization showed that urban OA was more influenced by aromatic compounds, whereas seaside OA contained higher proportions of aged aliphatic compounds. Two distinct pollution episodes were selected to investigate CHOX evolution. Case 1 (local accumulation) exhibited enhanced CHON signals attributable to increased organonitrate formation under elevated NOx levels, whereas Case 2 (marine air masses) showed enhanced CHO signals and a higher CHOX oxidation state likely resulting from intensified aqueous/heterogeneous reactions under humid conditions. These findings advance our understanding of OA molecular characteristics and chemical evolution under different environmental conditions."

We find that medians of MAESTRO measurements binned by month and latitude show reasonable correlation with other data sets, with notable increases after volcanic eruptions, and that biases in the data can be alleviated through a simple correction technique. Used with care, MAESTRO aerosol measurements provide information that can complement other data sets. 
 The Measurement of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO) instrument on the SCISAT satellite provides aerosol extinction measurements in multiple solar wavelength bands. In this study, we evaluate the quality and utility of MAESTRO version 3.13 stratospheric aerosol extinction retrievals, from February 2004–February 2021, through comparison with measurements from other satellite instruments. Despite significant scatter in the MAESTRO data, we find that gridded median MAESTRO aerosol extinctions and stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) values are generally in good agreement with those from other instruments during volcanically quiescent periods. After volcanic eruptions and wildfire injections, gridded median MAESTRO extinction and SAOD are well correlated with other measurement sets but generally biased low by 40 %–80 %. The Ångström exponent (AE), which can provide information on aerosol particle size, is derived from the MAESTRO spectral extinction measurements in the lowermost stratosphere, showing perturbations after volcanic eruptions qualitatively similar to those from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment on the International Space Station (SAGE III/ISS) for the eruptions of Ambae (2018) and Ulawun (2019). Differences in AE anomalies after the 2019 extratropical Raikoke eruption may be due to the different spatiotemporal sampling of the two instruments. Furthermore, we introduce a method to adjust MAESTRO extinction data based on comparison with extinction measurements from SAGE III/ISS during the period from June 2017–February 2021, resulting in improved comparison during volcanically active periods. Our work suggests that empirical bias correction may enhance the utility of MAESTRO aerosol extinction data, which can make it a useful complement to existing satellite records, especially when multi-wavelength solar occultation data from other instruments are unavailable."

The method is fully open source and parametric, such that unique field setups can be generated and reproduced. The method is extensively tested within a ~10cm grass canopy in a field campaign. 
 We present a novel, fine-resolution temperature profiling method based on Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) that is adaptable, reproducible, and fully FAIR. Accurate probing of near-surface temperature gradients requires sub-centimeter resolution, particularly in environments with short vegetation such as grass, where strong insulating properties promote steep gradients. Conventional DTS systems provide spatial resolutions of approximately 25 cm along fiber optic cables that can span several kilometers. By compacting such cables into a helical coil supported by a laser-cut frame, the Fine Resolution Adaptable Distributed Temperature Sensing (FRADTS) method attains vertical resolution and accuracy at the millimeter scale. The frame design is generated by a parametric script that outputs laser-cutting files, enabling users to assemble coil structures from sheet material with identical or easily adapted geometries. We demonstrate the method in both laboratory tests and a field campaign at the CESAR atmospheric observatory in Cabauw, the Netherlands, where a prototype coil captured high-quality vertical temperature profiles within the lowest meter above the soil, including a 10 cm grass layer. A resolution of 1.3 mm was attained and verified, and the influence of environmental factors such as solar radiation and precipitation on measurement biases was mapped and quantified. Despite minor artifacts, the method proved robust and effective, providing high-quality profiles under a wide range of weather conditions. As the method is modular and parametric, it can easily be applied in other research, potentially extending its application to other fields."

The dataset attains 83.78 % overall accuracy, consistent with the microwave-based products but with finer spatial detail. This detailed FT record provides valuable information to enhance the understanding of global hydrological and ecological impacts. 
 The global near-surface soil freeze-thaw (FT) states are crucial for understanding complex interactions with hydrological, ecological, and climatic processes. However, current remote sensing of FT states primarily relies on passive microwave remote sensing, which, despite its all-weather monitoring capabilities, suffers from low spatial resolution. This limitation restricts its application to hydroclimatological scales, precluding its use in finer-scale studies such as soil erosion and hydrometeorological applications. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel downscaling approach that integrates passive microwave and optical satellite data to generate a long-term (2002–2023), high-resolution (0.05°) dataset of global near-surface FT states, ensuring daily seamless continuity. The dataset was validated against in situ measurements, demonstrating that the high-resolution product maintains an overall accuracy of 83.78 %, consistent with the coarse-resolution microwave-based dataset, while offering enhanced spatial detail. Comprehensive global trend analyses provided new insights into the dynamics of FT cycles, revealing that the average annual number of frost days in regions north of 45° N is 187.8 ± 12.7 d, with 14.35 % of the area showing a decreasing trend in frozen persistence. Additionally, the average annual number of freeze onset dates is 240.3 ± 7.2, and 9.10 % of the area exhibits a trend of delayed freeze onset. The high-resolution record enables accurately monitoring FT states and providing detailed information for a refined understanding of hydrological and ecological effects globally.

 We present the data recorded by eight institutions within the PYROPHOB project, running from 2020 to 2024 at two forest research sites in the south-west of Brandenburg, Germany. The aim of the project was to monitor abiotic and biotic parameters of forest regrowth under different management regimes on former wildfire sites in northeastern Germany. The observations comprised intermittent and continuous measurements or surveys on meteorological parameters (rainfall, temperature, vapour pressure deficit), soil (soil type and texture, soil chemistry and leaching, water content, soil temperature), deadwood, stand structure, vegetation regrowth, abundance of selected fauna (moths, beetles, mammals), UAV-based remote sensing (stand structure, spatial overview), and photo monitoring (succession).

We proposed a microwave-optical integrated framework for high-precision salinity estimation, producing a 10 m resolution Inner Mongolia Xinjiang Lake zone lake salinity dataset (2016–2024). Salinity increased significantly in Lake Daihai and Lake Dalinor. The dataset can contribute to research on salinization prevention and salinity budget research. 
 Lake salinity is an important parameter to characterize physical and biogeochemical processes and a fundamental indicator to evaluate lake water quality. However, its estimation in inland waters has been challenging because passive microwave salinity satellites lack sufficient spatial resolution, and optical satellites cannot directly measure it. To address it, we constructed a framework for estimating lake salinity by combining Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. It can be summarized in step 1: construct a salinity mechanism model based on SAR data using the Elfouhaily spectrum, dielectric constant, and small perturbation method (SPM) models; step 2: develop four machine learning (ML) salinity algorithms using quasi-synchronous salinity and MSI with SAR imagery; and step 3: build an ensemble model to estimate salinity by coupling the mechanism and ML models via a generalized additive model. The proposed integrated algorithm (N = 84, RMSE = 0.60 ppt, and MAPE = 2.3 %) outperformed single-satellite microwave mechanistic or ML models across all eleven lakes in the Inner Mongolia Xinjiang Lake zone. On this basis, we reconstructed the lake salinity dataset for 2016–2024 and conducted independent validation (N = 65, R2 = 0.97, and RMSE = 0.89 ppt) and pixel-level histogram validation confirmed dataset quality, with no significant systematic bias across lake types. The reconstruction revealed a spatial pattern of smooth transition from the nearshore to the center and trends with significant increases in Lake Daihai and Lake Dalinor. The dataset and its development framework will facilitate exploration of salinity status and trends in inland lakes, providing scientific evidence and methodological support for salinization prevention and global lake salinity budget research.

We propose novel autoencoder models to automatically extract features and compare them with engineered seismic features. These features are then used to classify avalanches and noise events. The autoencoder feature classifiers exhibit the highest sensitivity in detecting avalanches, while the engineered seismic classifier performs better overall. 
 Monitoring snow avalanche activity is essential for operational avalanche forecasting and the successful implementation of mitigation measures to ensure safety in mountain regions. To facilitate and automate the monitoring process, avalanche detection systems equipped with seismic sensors can provide a cost-effective solution. Still, automatically distinguishing avalanche signals from other sources in seismic data remains challenging. This is mainly due to the complexity of seismic signals generated by avalanches, the complex signal transmission through the ground, the relatively rare occurrence of avalanches, and the presence of multiple sources in seismic data. To study and interpret the variety of these signals, we compiled a dataset of seismograms recorded with an array of five seismometers installed in an avalanche study site above Davos, Switzerland. For the winter seasons of 2020–2021 and 2021–2022, this dataset comprised 84 avalanches and 828 noise (unrelated to avalanches) events. An approach to automate the detection of avalanches in seismic data is by applying machine learning methods. So far, research in this area has mainly focused on extracting domain-specific signal attributes as input features for statistical models. In contrast, we propose a novel application of representation learning from seismograms using autoencoder models to automatically extract features from 10 s seismic signals of snow avalanches. On top of that, we applied random forest classifiers to evaluate whether these features facilitate the detection of avalanches. Concretely, we trained one random forest classifier each on a set of expert-engineered seismic attributes (baseline), temporal autoencoder features and spectral autoencoder features. The classifiers achieved an avalanche recall of 0.67 (±0.00) (baseline), 0.71 (±0.02) (temporal autoencoder) and 0.70 (±0.01) (spectral autoencoder) and macro average f1-scores of 0.78 (±0.00) (baseline), 0.70 (±0.01) (temporal autoencoder) and 0.77 (±0.01) (spectral autoencoder). The developed approach could be potentially used as an operational, near real-time avalanche detection system. Yet, the relatively high number of false alarms still needs further implementation of the current automated seismic classification algorithms for effective avalanche detection."

This work reviews the use of machine learning in tropospheric ozone research, focusing on three main application areas in which significant progress has been made. Common challenges in using machine learning across the three areas are highlighted, and future directions for the field are indicated. 
 Machine learning (ML) is transforming atmospheric chemistry, offering powerful tools to address challenges in tropospheric ozone research, a critical area for climate resilience and public health. As in adjacent fields, ML approaches complement existing research by learning patterns from ever-increasing volumes of atmospheric and environmental data relevant to ozone. We highlight the rapid progress made in the field since Phase 1 of the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR), focussing particularly on the most active areas of research, namely short-term ozone forecasting, emulation of atmospheric chemistry and the use of remote sensing for ozone estimation. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements, highlights critical challenges, and proposes actionable pathways to develop ML in ozone research. Further advances hinge on addressing domain-specific issues such as the dependence of ozone concentrations on several poorly observed precursor species, as well as making progress on generic ML challenges such as the definition of suitable benchmarks and developing robust, explainable models. Reaping the full potential of ML for ozone research and operational applications will require close collaborations across atmospheric chemistry, ML and computational science and vigilant pursuit of the rapid developments in adjacent fields."

However, in mountain regions, temperature sensors are often placed higher up to avoid being buried in snow in winter. We show that the measurement height is of high importance when quantifying the errors made by weather prediction models. Also, it should be accounted for when these observations are used to correct the models in real time, as doing otherwise degrades their forecasts at high altitudes. 
 The near-surface air temperature, considered to be measured at about 2 m above the ground, is a key meteorological parameter with a wealth of uses for humankind. However, its accurate estimation in mountain regions is impeded by persistent limits inherent to atmospheric modeling over complex terrain. In the present study, we analyze the role of structural inhomogeneities of the valleys and mountains observational network in France to highlight their contribution to  the misrepresentation of near-surface air temperature over mountain regions in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) system Arome-France. We examine in particular the effects of the disparity in height above ground of the temperature measurements, of the inhomogeneous geographical distribution of stations that are preferentially located in valleys, and of the relief mismatch between station location and model grid points. The consequences of these inhomogeneities are analyzed through their effect on model performance evaluation and on the assimilation, with a focus on the winter season. In France, high-altitude stations usually measure temperature at about 7 m over the snow-free ground and on average 1 to 2 m lower when the ground is snow-covered in winter. We show that this height difference with respect to standard stations measuring at 2 m should be considered both when evaluating the model performances and in assimilation. In terms of scores, model behaviors can be highly different at 2 m vs.  5 m so that confounding the two levels can lead to a strong mischaracterization of model biases. This confusion additionally makes the assimilation of high-altitude stations detrimental to the analysis for the Arome-France NWP system. We also show that due to the current 3DVar assimilation system, the assimilation of valley stations affects the near-surface temperature analysis at all altitudes in the mountains. On the other hand, the altitude mismatch between observation points and model grid points does not play an important role, probably in part due to its relatively marginal occurrence in an NWP system with 1.3 km grid spacing. In summary, this study describes new methods and provides guidelines for comparing models with mountain observation data in terms of both assimilation and performance assessment."

 MATCRO-Soy is an eco-physiological process-based crop model for soybean (Glycine max L. (Merr.)). It was developed by modifying the parameters of MATCRO-Rice, which integrates crop growth processes with a land surface model. The original model was modified using data from the literature and field experiments conducted in countries around the world. The reliability of the model was extensively validated by comparing the simulated yields with observed yields at global, national, and grid-cell levels. Moderate correlations were detected between the yields predicted by MATCRO-Soy and yield data in the Food and Agriculture Organization's FAOSTAT database, with correlation coefficients of 0.81 (p<0.001) for the global average yield and 0.45 (p<0.01) for the global average detrended yield over a 34 year period (1981–2014). Furthermore, validation at the grid-cell level revealed a statistically significant correlation between the MATCRO-Soy simulated yield and the observed yield in 66 % of the grid cells in the global yield map. These results highlight the model's ability to reproduce soybean yield under different environmental conditions, integrating soil water availability and nitrogen fertilizer levels. The MATCRO-Soy model may enhance our understanding of crop physiology, especially crop responses to climate change.

This study investigates how midlatitude atmosphere–ocean interactions, as a feedback process, influence EAWM variability. Strong EAWM brings lower‐tropospheric cold air in early winter, enhancing upward surface heat fluxes over the midlatitude western North Pacific (WNP) around 30°N. These anomalous fluxes progressively cool sea surface temperature (SST) south of Japan until late winter. Atmospheric general circulation model experiments revealed that the resulting cold SST anomalies modulate storm‐track activity and transient eddy‐mean flow interaction, facilitating an EAWM‐related cyclonic anomaly east of Japan in late winter. This circulation response acts to reinforces the EAWM, leading to further lower‐tropospheric cooling around Japan. These findings highlight the active role of the midlatitude WNP and importance of the atmosphere–ocean interactions in driving the EAWM variability."

Despite extensive examinations of long‐term temperature trends, salinity changes remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed more than 40 years of observational data to examine long‐term variations in both temperature and salinity. Surface‐limited freshening was found in the southeastern SJ, whereas a robust subsurface freshening emerged in the central SJ off the coast of Japan in spring. This trend is driven by increased river discharge due to enhanced precipitation over Japanese mainland and intensified mesoscale eddy activity, which remotely facilitates offshore freshwater transport. Springtime freshening may shoal the mixed layer, reduce heat content, and promote marine heat waves, potentially affecting marine organisms. Given its broad implications for climate and ecosystems, this phenomenon represents a key aspect of oceanic change in the SJ."

A key challenge has been the prior inability of the higher‐frequency Shallow Radar (SHARAD) to detect this basal zone, hindering potential diagnostic cross‐frequency comparisons. Due to a novel spacecraft maneuver, SHARAD has now obtained a basal return associated with the putative body of water. Modeling of the radar response is not consistent with the liquid water explanation, instead suggesting a localized, low roughness region of dry rock/dust beneath the ice could explain the SHARAD response.

Recent theoretical studies have hypothesized that such upwelling may primarily occur within a bottom boundary layer (BBL) along the sloping seafloor. A dye experiment in a continental‐slope canyon during the BLT‐Recipes program revealed very rapid BBL‐focussed upwelling, endorsing this notion. Here, we elucidate the dynamical connection between the mixing and the upwelling. We show that along‐canyon upwelling stems from episodic turbulent mixing cells up to 250 m high, generated by tides sweeping up‐ and down‐canyon. The tidal currents support a vertical shear that periodically advects dense waters over slower‐flowing lighter waters, reducing BBL stratification. This triggers instabilities that mix the dense waters with neighboring lighter waters, resulting in net along‐boundary upwelling. Our findings substantiate the view that deep‐ocean upwelling can predominantly occur along the ocean's sloping boundaries."

This study uses oxygen isotopes to trace freshwater transport from the Amundsen Sea to the Ross Sea. Results show that Winter Water (WW) in the Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) has lower δ18O values (<−0.7‰) due to glacial meltwater (GMW) inputs from the Amundsen Sea shelf. Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) in the Ross Sea, formed by mixing upwelled Upper Circumpolar Deep Water and ASC WW, has intermediate salinity and δ18O values. High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) forms from mCDW during sea ice formation and is further modified by mixing with GMW, resulting in distinctly low δ18O of <−0.8‰. In 2020, HSSW δ18O averaged 0.25‰ lower than in 2000, suggesting freshwater from the Amundsen Sea and local ice shelf melting contribute to the Ross Sea's freshening.

Adequate knowledge of monsoon characteristics is necessary for understanding the development of extreme weather events. Given that the monsoon is usually associated with distinct variations in water vapor between dry and wet seasons and rapid dry‐wet transitions, understanding the distribution and variability of water vapor can help characterize the monsoon. In this work, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data from over 1,000 stations densely distributed in China were used to obtain zenith tropospheric delays (ZTDs). Combined with ERA5 meteorological data, precipitable water vapor (PWV) grid products were retrieved during the period 2016–2020 to characterize the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM). To address the issue of data gaps in GNSS‐derived PWV, we employed a random forest machine learning method using ERA5‐derived PWV for data imputation ensuring the integrity of the products. We first utilized the bimodality of PWV statistical distribution and selected a suitable metric to quantify the monsoon impact across different regions. Subsequently, the normalized precipitable water indexes (NPWI) were constructed based on temporal variations in PWV to describe the monsoon movement characteristics. The average monsoon onset in China occurs from late May to mid‐June (Day of year (DOY) 150–170), whereas the monsoon retreat takes place in September (DOY 252–274). The interannual variability of the monsoon onset and retreat times is similar with a variation of around 10 days. Generally, the monsoon advances from southeast to northwest over China with an uneven speed."

Accurate representation of the heterogeneous distribution of fuels and the structure of smoke plumes requires high‐resolution modeling frameworks. In this study, we conducted simulations of prescribed burns in Fort Benning, Georgia, with BlueSky‐CMAQ and WRF‐SFIRE modeling frameworks and compared the differences between the results. BlueSky‐CMAQ was run at a 1‐km resolution, while WRF‐SFIRE operated at a 200‐m resolution, both generating outputs every 20 min. We compared the emission profiles, smoke plume structures, and ground‐level concentrations of pollutants between these two modeling frameworks. We used measurements of winds and pollutant concentrations collected at the military base to evaluate model performance and identify critical factors affecting simulation accuracy, including the plume rise scheme, uncertainties from satellite‐detected fire start time and FRP, and biases in wind simulations. All settings of the simulation frameworks showed a correlation higher than 0.21 with measurements of PM2.5 during the prescribed burning periods. The WRF‐SFIRE had the highest correlation (r = 0.29) with observation, and the BlueSky‐CMAQ with Freitas plume rise scheme showed the best performance for simulating the intensity of detected smoke, with a regression slope of 0.93. The findings and lessons learned are presented to inform future field measurement design and model implementations for studying the prescribed fire impacts on local air quality."

 Intervertebral disc degeneration is a major cause of low back pain and is driven by a vicious cycle of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ferroptosis, and inflammation, afflicting millions of people worldwide. Breaking this cycle represents a significant therapeutic challenge. Here, we develop a ROS-responsive hydrogel loading a resident nanozyme system composed of nucleus pulposus cell membrane-coated black phosphorus@cerium oxide to disrupt this degenerative cascade. Specifically, the nanozyme exhibits a self-sustaining cerium redox cycle due to the incorporation of black phosphorus nanosheets into cerium oxide, conferring durable antioxidant capacity for scavenging ROS. Furthermore, it suppresses the inflammatory cytokine IL6 by inhibiting HuR-mediated mRNA stabilization, thereby blocking the pro-inflammatory and pro-ferroptotic IL6/STAT3 axis. Together, this dual mechanism enables our nanozyme-functionalized hydrogel to break the ROS-ferroptosis-inflammation feedback loop, thus effectively promoting structural and functional disc repair.

 Acetic acid is an essential chemical with industrial and consumer relevance, and global demand is expected to reach 24.5 million tonnes by 2025. Electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) over Cu offers a sustainable route to acetate from waste carbon, but identifying catalysts with high CO-to-acetate selectivity remains challenging due to limited mechanistic understanding. Here, we establish an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven multi-scale simulation framework integrating grand-canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT), microkinetic modeling (MKM), and active learning to elucidate the CORR mechanism and guide catalyst discovery. The DFT-based MKM reveals that acetate forms via CO-CH coupling, with CH* binding energy identified as the key descriptor governing selectivity of acetate production from CORR. Active learning optimization predicts Cu/Pd (2:1) and Cu/Ag (3:1) as the most selective catalysts.

 Self-adaptive compliance and gas permeability are crucial properties for on-skin electronics, enabling the reliable extraction of high-fidelity electrophysiological signals for applications in personal healthcare and robotic control. However, integrating these two properties into a single device, particularly under dynamic skin deformations, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an ultrathin liquid crystal elastomer-based sheath-core ionic nanomesh that synergizes soft elasticity with ionic conductivity to create self-compliant and breathable bioelectronic interfaces. The nanomesh features a hydrophilic sheath and a porous architecture, which ensure high moisture and air permeability for superior wearable comfort. Moreover, the unique liquid-like deformation of liquid crystal directors facilitates nearly stress-free skin-device junctions, promoting fatigue-resistant adhesion against various interfacial failures.

 Tuberculosis (TB) is the biggest cause of death from infectious disease worldwide. The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), possesses a complex cell envelope comprised of multiple classes of unique lipids. The macrophage phagosome is a key reservoir of infection in pulmonary TB and multiple studies have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) is limiting in this environment. Here, we show that during Pi restriction the Mtb lipidome markedly remodels such that phospholipids are replaced with multiple classes of phosphorus-free lipids. This envelope lipidome remodelling suggests that standard Mtb culture conditions that use media with high concentrations of Pi do not reflect the physiologic environment during infection, thereby undermining vaccine and drug development for tuberculosis. Further, we discover that Mtb can metabolise phospholipid polar heads abundant in host pulmonary surfactant as an alternative phosphate source. Therefore, we present two mechanisms where Mtb manipulates lipid metabolism to overcome host restriction.

 Extreme rainfall and flooding, driven by a powerful atmospheric river (AR) and a persistent Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), hit Southern California in February 2024 during the 2023–2024 El Niño, affecting over 10 million people. ARs are key contributors to extreme rainfall and flooding along the U.S. West Coast. Although the AR-MJO link has been documented, its spatio-temporal variability remains a major forecasting and risk-management challenge. Combining precipitation, stream gauge and demographic data, we quantify the physical drivers and population exposure to this extreme event. Leveraging a Lagrangian MJO precipitation tracking algorithm, we unravel the multiscale interactions responsible for the AR’s development. El Niño favored a large, long-lived MJO that interacted with the North Pacific Jet (NPJ) over more than three weeks. The MJO convective outflow modulated the NPJ by inducing negative potential vorticity advection along the tropopause. The ensuing NPJ extension and acceleration induced explosive cyclogenesis, whose AR-driven moisture transport resulted in extreme rainfall."

 The relation of regional precipitation and streamflow sensitivities to warming is complicated by runoff often being the small residual in the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration. In addition, the inhomogeneous nature of land-hydrological properties and hydrological interventions by humans, like irrigation and dams, have made streamflow sensitivities challenging to constrain with both climate models and observations. Here, we elucidate the hydrological processes driving the regionally varying mean and extreme streamflow sensitivities to warming across the contiguous United States in a counter-factual warming scenario using GFDL’s moderately high-resolution global climate model. We show that over the West Coast and eastern US, atmospheric rivers are the dominant driver of high-flows in the present climate and of more frequent high-flows in a warmer climate. Over the mountainous western US, streamflows dwindle despite increases in precipitation and antecedent soil moisture, as loss of snow fuels evapotranspiration at double the rate of precipitation changes."

 Accurate weather forecasting is essential for a broad range of socioeconomic activities. While data-driven approaches match numerical weather prediction accuracy with reduced computational cost, their deterministic nature overlooks uncertainties in initial state estimate, model systematic biases, and stochasticity arising from unresolved subgrid physical processes. This obliviousness results in over-confident deterministic predictions that limit operational utility and allow prediction errors to compound over time, rendering uncertainty quantification and error correction intractable. To address these challenges, we present the Generative Ensemble Prediction System (GenEPS), a framework that systematically explores uncertainties in initial states, model formulations, and model stochasticity. GenEPS provides a plug-and-play solution for ensemble forecasting with arbitrary data-driven deterministic weather prediction models. Initial conditions and stochastic uncertainty sampling mitigate random errors, while cross-model integration accounts for inherent model formulation differences to reduce systematic biases. By explicitly representing all three sources of uncertainty, GenEPS outperforms state-of-the-art numerical ensemble predictions and data-driven predictions when evaluated against ERA5 reanalysis data using both deterministic and probabilistic metrics. GenEPS also enhances extreme event predictions, offering physically consistent forecast fields. These advances establish a new paradigm in ensemble forecasting through multi-model generative integration, combining a surging number of data-driven weather forecasting models and potentially numerical models, to achieve more reliable predictions."

 Recent decades have witnessed unprecedented extreme precipitation and catastrophic flooding in some of the most populated regions in Southeast Asia during boreal winter. These extreme events are often influenced by the cross-equatorial northerly surge (CENS), characterized by a strengthening of northerly moist monsoon winds south of the equator in the western Maritime Continent. However, the potential future changes in CENS and its hydrological impacts remain underexplored. Here, using an ensemble of high-resolution climate model simulations (CMIP6 HighResMIP), we show that the regional impacts of CENS on the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events are projected to significantly increase in the near future (2030–2050), particularly over the adjacent coastal regions of southern Indonesia and northwestern Australia. More specifically, the risk of CENS-related extreme precipitation is projected to increase by up to 39 ± 1.2% relative to the seasonal probability, despite no apparent changes in the CENS characteristics in the near future. Such stronger impact is attributed to the enhanced moistening efficiency and moist static instability due to a more humid and warmer environment, which leads to more intense CENS convection. Our results suggest the need for effective monitoring and disaster managements to respond to the increasing severity of such events in the near future."

 Basaltic melts may variably disaggregate macrocrysts (large crystals) from crystal mushes during the assembly of magma bodies beneath ocean-island volcanoes. The entrained macrocrysts modulate the crystallinity, density, and rheology of magmas, parameters that control magma system architecture and eruptive dynamics. However, the timescales, drivers, and consequences of inconstant crystal mush incorporation into carrier melts require quantification. Here, we use a suite of plagioclase-rich basalts to show that the entrainment efficiency (the ability for melts to disaggregate and entrain macrocrysts from crystal mushes) is temporally variable on inter-eruption timescales at ocean-island volcanoes. Macrocryst cargoes are predominantly out of equilibrium with their carrier melts in both chemistries and mass proportions (ratios of different macrocryst phases). Geochemical and petrological evidence reveals that macrocryst mass proportions are established in a density-stratified melt-rich reservoir shortly before eruption, whereas the absolute crystallinity is a function of crustal physics, likely driven by fluctuations of annual-to-millennial melt supply. Variations in entrainment efficiency explain several universal, but enigmatic, features in oceanic volcanic systems, such as decoupled crystallinity–temperature–time relationships and the dearth of plagioclase-rich basalts at fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges. Systematically studying temporally constrained eruptive products offers a unique window into the evolution of crystal-rich magma storage zones.

 Large predators are returning to landscapes where they have been absent for centuries, but human preferences complicate their recovery. Communities often resist predator recovery because of perceived risks, limiting what managers call social carrying capacity, or the level of human tolerance for coexisting with wildlife. Yet practical methods for measuring and integrating social carrying capacity into management decisions remain limited. To address this, we combine geospatial and survey data to model individual tolerance for the frequency and severity of grizzly bear encounters. The resulting estimates predict and map zip code-level tolerance across the region. Findings show that people tend to overestimate management’s tolerance of encounters than current federal guidelines. This approach provides a pragmatic tool to incorporate social carrying capacity into decisions about predator recovery and reintroduction, helping balance ecological goals with public acceptance.

 In the past decades, the California Current Ecosystem has experienced intense marine heatwaves, which have induced significant disruptions to local phytoplankton communities. Here, using 30-year cruise observations, we identify a previously undocumented vertical structure in chlorophyll-a concentration response to marine heatwaves, characterized by reductions in the surface layer coupled with increases in the subsurface. By integrating observations and coupled physical-biogeochemical model products, we demonstrate that declines of surface chlorophyll-a are primarily attributed to suppressed nutrient upwelled to the upper ocean. Although surface irradiance increased modestly (+3.5%), light availability in the subsurface layer improved substantially (+21.7%) due to reduced phytoplankton shading at the surface. Concurrent with enhanced lateral nutrient transport, phytoplankton growth at depth was promoted during heatwave events. This study highlights the pivotal role of subsurface phytoplankton dynamics in shaping the vertical chlorophyll-a concentration structure and its variability under extreme events.

 Rivers originating from the Andes Mountains are vital water sources for agricultural and societal needs in South America, yet are increasingly threatened by climate change. Here we reconstruct streamflow of the Negro River (Rió Negro) in northern Patagonia over the past 827 years using tree-ring records from the south-central Andes foothills. This reconstruction reveals an unprecedented decline in river flow in recent decades. Moisture from the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode provides a key water source, but temperature rise has increased atmospheric moisture demand and reduced availability. Antarctic amplification has further disrupted circulation patterns and accelerated warming, intensifying regional aridity. Since the 20th century, the Negro River has experienced a sustained flow reduction of approximately 10% per decade.

 Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is the main source of copper worldwide and is usually formed at high temperature. Its occurrence at low temperature is poorly documented, and the mechanisms controlling its formation remain uncertain. We found evidences of chalcopyrite formation in acidic pit lake sediments at ~ 12 °C. Using high-resolution electron microscopy and synchrotron-based spectroscopy, we observed aggregates of nanoscale crystals with the composition and structure of disordered chalcopyrite. Laboratory incubations at 20 °C and geochemical modelling suggest that microbial activity may contribute to chalcopyrite formation under these conditions. Particularly, crystal growth was associated with hollow structures resembling microbial cell surfaces, and on the membranes of eukaryotic-like cells, providing nucleation sites. Our findings suggest that microbial processes, including the production of hydrogen sulfide and the presence of organic surfaces, promote chalcopyrite formation at low temperature. This has implications for understanding copper and sulfur cycling and its potential biotechnological application in sulfidic environments.

Here we present a global meta-analysis of 104 studies to assess the effects of plant invasion on soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Our results showed that plant invasion significantly increased all three GHG emissions from soils. Model selection analysis indicated that the photosynthetic pathway of invasive plants (C3 or C4) and soil organic carbon (SOC) were the primary factors governing the variation in GHGs emissions. Specifically, invasion by C4 plants increased all three GHG emissions from soils more than C3 plants, whereas SOC mainly influenced the invasion-induced emissions of soil CO2 and CH4. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how invasive plants alter soil GHG fluxes and cause the associated impacts on biogeochemical cycles.

 Soil spectroscopy is a powerful technique for soil monitoring. Hundreds of soil spectral datasets, both open-access and private, are used for various applications, despite potential errors. This study presents a filtering protocol to enhance the quality of soil spectral datasets from laboratory and satellite sources, here termed the Spectral Quality Protocol (SQuaP). At the beginning, we utilized a database of 9261 Brazilian soil samples, with paired laboratory hyperspectral (350–2500 nm), and Sentinel-2 multispectral data. Afterwards, we tested SQuaP on world-wide open datasets and on bare soil satellite observations identified by the Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3). A filtering approach is presented where we applied rule-based checks (crop residues, reflectance trend) flagged outliers via PCA-Mahalanobis, enforced contextual consistency with soil line regression, detecd cluster-aware anomalies using Isolation Forest within clusters, and validated property spectrum coherence via Random-Forest residuals. Results demonstrated at SQuaP enhances spectral data reliability, and consequently modeling performance of clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) using a Random Forest algorithm. For the hyperspectral data SQuaP increased R2 of 17.55 % for clay and 1.58 % for SOC, and reduced RMSE by 10.41 g kg−1 and 2.06 g kg−1, respectively. For satellite data, the improvements were even more pronounced, with an increase of 15.76 % for clay and 13.38 % for SOC on R2, and a reduction in RMSE. At the world scale, predictive performance improved after the implementation of SQuaP in nearly all continents, with gains in R2 ranging from −2.15 % to 13.40 % across evaluated scenarios. These findings highlight SQuAP's effectiveness in noise filtering and improving predictive accuracy, particularly for multispectral data. Furthermore, these improvements were achieved without compromising data variability, as confirmed by Kernel Desnsity Estimation (KDE) analysis, indicating that the protocol successfully removed outliers while preserving the statistical integrity of the dataset. SQuaP can be adapted to suit specific datasets and applications, facilitating more accurate soil property predictions and advancing in digital soil mapping and precision agriculture."

 Deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as potential tools for automated landform mapping. However, current approaches frequently overlook critical topographic features and prior topographic knowledge, which are essential for accurate landform differentiation. Consequently, these approaches struggle to resolve indistinct class boundaries and misclassification in transitional landform zones. The application of transformer-based approaches to landform mapping remains rare, although these methods are well-suited for capturing global geomorphic patterns. In this study, we develop TKGFormer, a topographic knowledge-guided and transformer-based DL model specifically designed for landform classification. This model explicitly integrates terrain residuals and multi-scale terrain feature-guided attention mechanisms to emphasise key topographic features and improve classification accuracy. We introduce a topographic feature prior loss function, which constrains the learning process by enforcing consistency between predicted landform classes and fundamental terrain characteristics. Moreover, we design an efficient decoder to enhance multiscale feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that TKGFormer outperforms five CNN-based models and two transformer-based model in landform mapping by using bare Earth 30 m resolution Copernicus digital elevation data. In terms of mIoU, TKGFormer exhibits an improvement that ranges from 4.4 % to 20.7 % over the other models.

The experimental results show that the MRD fairness model significantly improves resource allocation fairness. Compared with the maximum coverage model, the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation decrease by 42.56 % and 57.59 %, respectively, and the Jain’s fairness index simultaneously increases by 94.33 %. Regarding patrol region configuration, the proposed method decreases resource redundancy by 66.62 % and increases the spatial balance of facility distribution by 7.5 %, thereby effectively improving resource utilization and spatial layout rationality. Additionally, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy substantially reduces computational time compared to the classical mixed-integer programming solver, efficiently meeting dual constraints of fairness and coverage effectiveness. In summary, this study integrates MRD constraints and DRL to achieve equitable, efficient policing resource allocation, providing a practical and effective technical pathway for addressing fairness and efficiency demands."

 Despite significant progress in reducing primary pollutants in China, surface ozone pollution remains a pressing challenge. This study evaluates the effectiveness of Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA) curves—constructed using Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), Observation-Based Model (OBM), and Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach for Machine Learning (MLEKMA)—in guiding ozone control strategies in Luoyang. The levels of O3 and precursors between two sampling campaigns present two main paradoxes, that reduction in source inventory do not guarantee the decrease of atmospheric NOx and VOC levels, and reduction of precursors do not always result in O3 decline. As indicated by all three models, O3 sensitivity in Luoyang was in a transition regime in both 2019 and 2021. However, only the WRF-Chem model yielded ozone concentration predictions (169.0–171.0 μg/m3) that closely matched the observed values (168.8 μg/m3), while OBM and MLEKMA significantly underestimated ozone levels—the observed concentrations were 2–3 times and 3–5 times higher than the respective model predictions. Each method presents its limitations: the WRF-Chem model lacks real-time responsiveness, while OBM and MLEKMA exhibit deficiencies in accurately predicting ozone concentrations. Therefore, integrating multiple EKMA-derived methods is recommended for practical ozone management. By leveraging the timeliness of OBM and MLEKMA alongside the predictive accuracy of WRF-Chem, a rapid and robust multi-model approach for urban ozone sensitivity assessment can be achieved, enabling governments to formulate more effective ozone control policies."

 Neutron reflectometry was used to examine the reaction of gas-phase hydroxyl radicals with thin surfactant films at the air–water interface. The films comprised insoluble material extracted from aerosol particulate matter collected from the atmosphere of a broadleaf woodland; sampled above and below the canopy across spring, summer, and winter. The measurements presented here act as a proxy for oxidation reactions at the air–water interface of broadleaf woodland atmospheric aqueous aerosols. The material extracted from the woodland atmosphere formed stable surfactant-like thin films at the air–water interface, with maximum thicknesses of 30 Å and neutron scattering length densities between 0.1 × 10−6Å −2 and 2.5 × 10−6Å −2. Oxidation by hydroxyl radicals reduced the amount of interfacial material, leaving an oxidation-resistant fraction of 20%–60% of the original film. The values of the surface reaction coefficients, determined by KM-SUB, for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with woodland films were approximately 10−7 cm2 s−1. Film half-lives were estimated to be 1—2 h in typical day-time hydroxyl radical concentrations and 2 days–1 week in night-time concentrations. Thus, organic material extracted from temperate, broadleaf woodland aerosol can form thin, stable surfactant films at the air–water interface that can be partially removed by the gas-phase hydroxyl radical at a significant enough rate to warrant inclusion in atmospheric models."

 As China's air pollution control advances, ground-level ozone (O3) has gradually replaced PM2.5 as the primary pollutant, threatening public health. Spanning COVID-19 control to economic recovery, 2019–2024 witnessed anthropogenic changes. Yet, understanding of O3's spatiotemporal patterns, extreme-temperature sensitivity, and causal mechanisms during this period remains inadequate, limiting effective policy responses. To address these, this study, integrating ground-based O3 observations, TROPOMI products, and ERA5 meteorological data, developed a BiTCN-Attention model to estimate China's 1km-resolution monthly average O3 (2019–2024). 10-fold cross-validation confirmed its performance (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 6.96 μg/m3), with stable spatial generalization (R2 = 0.88) and monthly prediction ability (R2 = 0.81–0.94). Spatiotemporal analysis revealed: (1) O3 presented a “dual-core gradient expansion” pattern with high-concentration cores in the North China Plain (anthropogenically driven) and Northwest China (naturally driven); (2) nationwide O3 increased significantly (0.94 μg/m3/yr, p < 0.005) with high-concentration areas expanding inland; (3) during extreme summer heat (2022−2023), the intensity, position, and wind speed of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) dictated O3's regional dispersion patterns. Causal inference via double machine learning indicated temperature (ATE = 7.39) and solar radiation (ATE = 3.7) were core drivers with nonlinear thresholds (temperature > 17.16 °C, solar radiation > 157.94 W/m2). Regionally, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei was temperature-dominated; Yangtze River Delta and Greater Bay Area showed diurnal “dilution–accumulation” by land-sea breeze; by topographic obstruction and stable weather, inland agglomerations (e.g., Chengdu-Chongqing) had rapid O3/precursor accumulation.

 The integration of Global Navigation Satellite System-Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) and radiosonde datasets plays a critical role in atmospheric profiling, offering complementary strengths in meteorological observation. While radiosonde data provide high-resolution vertical profiles, they often face spatial and temporal limitations across various regions, particularly over oceans and remote areas. These gaps can be effectively mitigated by the global coverage offered by GNSS-RO data. In this study, we investigate the impacts of assimilating these two distinct datasets (GNSS-RO and radiosonde) individually and combined on the initial condition for the model, as well as the model forecast through observing system experiments (OSEs). This study also analyses how the assimilation of these observations impacts the assimilation of the other observations by assessing the background and analysis innovations. For these OSEs, we employed the NCMRWF Unified Model (NCUM) with a Four-Dimensional Variational (4D-Var) data assimilation approach to incorporate various observational data received from multiple sources. Four experiments were conducted over 1–10 July 2024: control (CNTL) excluding radiosonde and GNSS-RO data, RO experiment assimilating GNSS-RO, RS experiment assimilating radiosonde data, and RSRO experiment assimilating both. The analysis focuses on a heavy rainfall event on 7–8 July 2024, assessing forecasts of temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall at day-1, day-3, and day-5 lead times, and validating against ERA5 and IMERG datasets. Results show that assimilating GNSS-RO and radiosonde data primarily enhances temperature forecasts at upper levels and humidity forecasts at low and mid-levels. Notably, the assimilation of these observations leads to significant improvements in rainfall prediction. Rainfall forecasts, particularly at day-3, show the greatest improvement: 1.9 % in RO, 7.8 % in RS, and 12.6 % in the RSRO experiment."

 To investigate the impact of microphysics schemes on uncertainties in cloud seeding modeling, parameterizations of silver-iodide-related ice nucleation processes were implemented as a standalone physics module within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The new module is compatible with most bulk microphysics schemes available in the WRF model. Using this module, an 18-member cloud seeding ensemble forecast was developed using three sets of initial and lateral boundary conditions (IC/LBCs) and six microphysics schemes. Twin ensemble forecast experiments, one control (without cloud seeding) and one seeded, were performed to estimate precipitation enhancement potential in post-frontal stratiform clouds during a snowfall event over Danjiangkou Reservoir catchment area in central China. The control ensemble reproduced the overall pattern of precipitation well, while the seeded ensemble predicted primarily positive precipitation potential over the target area. The IC/LBCs and microphysics schemes exert comparable influences on variations in supercooled liquid water and precipitation. The IC/LBCs had more pronounced effects on the spatial distribution of verified variables, while microphysics scheme had greater influence on the intensity. However, microphysics schemes exerted greater influence on the variations of cloud seeding induced changes in microphysical variables and precipitation. The results of this study highlight the importance of incorporating multiple microphysics schemes in cloud seeding modeling for improved representation of uncertainties."
