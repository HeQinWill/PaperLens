The probability of a transition from one type of event to another is influenced by multiple factors of which many are projected to change. Here we assess the likelihood of ENSO transitions in observations and climate models, including a distinction between events that peak in the Eastern Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP). We find that the initial ENSO state influences the likelihood of certain transitions and that some transitions are not physically possible or stochastically likely. For example, transitions to CP events are more likely than EP events except from a neutral state. We also find that El Niños tend to occur as singular events compared to La Niñas. While consecutive El Niño and La Niña events of EP type are possible, opposing EP events do not occur in succession. We identify several transitions likely driven by internal dynamical processes including neutral conditions to El Niño, CP El Niño to another El Niño, EP El Niño to CP La Niña, CP La Niña to CP El Niño and La Niña, and EP La Niña to neutral and CP El Niño. Projections of future transitions show an increased probability of transitions to CP El Niño events while transitions to EP La Niña events become less frequent under a high-emissions scenario. Accordingly, transitions to these events become more and less likely, respectively. We also find changes in the likelihood of specific transitions in a warming world: consecutive CP El Niño events become more likely while EP El Niño events become less likely to transition into CP La Niña events. These changes are expected to occur as early as 2050 with some changes to be accelerated by the end of the 21st century."

This review aimed to identify and assess literature that examines the health and wellbeing co-benefits of climate action in urban areas and to identify potential co-benefits that could be incorporated into policy or programme evaluation. We searched Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science, and screened titles, abstracts, and full-text. Peer-reviewed studies in English were included if they focused on health and wellbeing co-benefits of climate change adaptation and/or mitigation policies and programmes specific to urban areas. Our analysis found that all 39 studies in this review identified positive health and wellbeing co-benefits, with the majority focusing on transport policies and cross-sectoral mitigation and adaptation. All included studies employed a diverse array of modelling methodology, with multiple models and interdisciplinary approaches to evaluate co-benefits. Co-benefits ranged from reduced or avoided mortality and morbidity to social and economic health benefits. The degree of co-benefits differed according to the policies themselves; the policy sector; and vulnerability, demographic and/or geographic factors. Nine studies identified negative trade-offs of climate action. The review’s findings add to existing literature in support of the value and importance of assessing the health and wellbeing co-benefits of climate action. The review also highlights the need for further identification and quantification of a comprehensive set of health and wellbeing co-benefits, improved data reporting and granularity, as well as research evaluating the impact of climate action that considers how vulnerability, demographic, geographic or other factors interact with policy implementation. This research is critical in informing the cost-effective prioritisation and coordination of climate policies that maximise human health benefits and promote health equity by minimising trade-offs for vulnerable groups."

What if such a low-emission, intense-LUC scenario actually materialized? This paper quantifies the biophysical effects of LUC under SSP1-2.6 using an ensemble of regional climate simulations over Europe. We find that LUC projected over the 21st century, primarily broadleaf-tree forestation at the expense of grasslands, reduce summertime heat extremes significantly over large swaths of continental Europe. In fact, cooling from LUC trumps warming by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, resulting in milder heat extremes by 2100 for about half of the European population. Forestation brings heat relief by shifting the partition of turbulent energy fluxes away from sensible and towards latent heat fluxes. Impacts on the water cycle are then assessed. Forestation enhances precipitation recycling over continental Europe, but not enough to match the boost of evapotranspiration (green water flux). Run-off (blue water flux) is reduced as a consequence. Some regions experience severe drying in response. In other words, forestation turns blue water green, bringing heat relief but compromising water availability in some already-dry regions."

The representation of emissions taking into account a proxy for vegetation surface and specific humidity enables us to reproduce very accurately the seasonal cycle of fungal spores. Furthermore, we estimate that fungal spores can account for 20 % of PM10 and 40 % of the organic fraction of PM10 over vegetated areas in summer. 
 Fungal spore organic aerosol emissions have been recognised as a significant source of particulate matter as PM10; however, they are not widely considered in current air quality models. In this work, we have implemented the parameterisation of fungal spore organic aerosol (OA) emissions introduced by Heald and Spracklen (2009) (H&S) and further modified by Hoose et al. (2010) in the CHIMERE regional chemistry-transport model. This simple parameterisation is based on two variables, leaf area index (LAI) and specific humidity. We have validated the geographical and temporal representativeness of this parameterisation on a large scale by using yearly polyol observations and primary biogenic organic aerosol factors from positive matrix factorisation (PMF) analysis at 11 French measurement sites. For a group of sites in northern and eastern France, the seasonal variation of fungal spore emissions, displaying large summer and small winter values, is correctly depicted. However, the H&S parameterisation fails to capture fungal spore concentrations for a smaller group of Mediterranean sites with less data availability in terms of both absolute values and seasonal variability, leading to strong negative biases, especially during the autumn and winter seasons. Two years of CHIMERE simulations with the H&S parameterisation have shown a significant contribution of fungal spore OA to PM10 mass, which is lower than 10 % during winter and reaches up to 20 % during summer in high-emission zones, especially over large forested areas. In terms of contributions to organic matter (OM) concentrations, the simulated fungal spore contribution in autumn is as high as 40 % and reaches at most 30 % of the OM for the other seasons. As a conclusion, the fungal spore OA contribution to the total OM concentrations is shown to be substantial enough to be considered a major PM10 fraction and should then be included in state-of-the-art chemistry-transport models."

As NH3 in the atmosphere is influenced by NOx, we implemented DECSO to estimate NOx and NH3 emissions simultaneously. The emissions are derived over Europe for 2020 at a spatial resolution of 0.2° using daily observations from CrIS and TROPOMI. Results are compared to bottom-up emission inventories. 
 Over the past century, ammonia (NH3) emissions have increased with the growth of livestock and fertilizer usage. The abundant NH3 emissions lead to secondary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution, climate change, and a reduction in biodiversity, and they affect human health. Up-to-date and spatially and temporally resolved information on NH3 emissions is essential to better quantify their impact. In this study we applied the existing Daily Emissions Constrained by Satellite Observations (DECSO) algorithm to NH3 observations from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) to estimate NH3 emissions. Because NH3 in the atmosphere is influenced by nitrogen oxides (NOx), we implemented DECSO to estimate NOx and NH3 emissions simultaneously. The emissions are derived over Europe for 2020 on a spatial resolution of 0.2°×0.2° using daily observations from both CrIS and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI; on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite). Due to the limited number of daily satellite observations of NH3, monthly emissions of NH3 are reported. The total NH3 emissions derived from observations are about 8 Tg yr−1, with a precision of about 5 %–17 % per grid cell per year over the European domain (35–55° N, 10° W–30° E). The comparison of the satellite-derived NH3 emissions from DECSO with independent bottom-up inventories and in situ observations indicates a consistency in terms of magnitude on the country totals, with the results also being comparable regarding the temporal and spatial distributions. The validation of DECSO over Europe implies that we can use DECSO to quickly derive fairly accurate monthly emissions of NH3 over regions with limited local information on NH3 emissions."

The overall results deepen the understanding of the spatiotemporal differences in aminium characteristics and formation in China. 
 Amines and aminiums play an important role in particle formation, liquid-phase reactions, and climate change and have attracted considerable attention over the years. Here, we investigated the concentrations and compositions of aminiums in PM2.5 in 11 Chinese cities during the winter, focusing on the characteristics of aminiums during the polluted days and the key factors influencing aminium outbreak. Monomethylaminium was the dominant aminium species in most cities, except Taiyuan and Guangzhou, followed by dimethylaminium. Diethylaminium dominated the total aminiums in Taiyuan and Guangzhou. Thus, the main amine sources in Taiyuan and Guangzhou were significantly different from those in other cities. The concentrations of the total aminiums (TAs) in most cities increased significantly during the polluted days, while relatively weak aminium outbreaks during the polluted days occurred in Xi'an and Beijing. Additionally, the concentrations of TAs in Xi'an and Beijing were insignificantly correlated with those of PM2.5 and the major acidic aerosol components, while the opposite pattern was observed in nine other cities. Thus, acid–base chemistry was significantly associated with the formation of aminiums in PM2.5 in all cities, except Xi'an and Beijing. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the aminiums : ammonium ratio to ammonium changes, as well as excluding the effects of relative humidity and atmospheric oxidation, we proposed the possibility of the competitive uptake of ammonia versus amines on acidic aerosols or the displacement of aminiums by ammonia in Xi'an and Beijing (constraining aminium outbreaks). Overall, this study deepens the understanding of the spatiotemporal differences in aminium characteristic and formation in China. However, the uptake of amines on particles to form aminiums and the relevant influencing factors require further mechanistic research."

Diner;Olga Kalashnikova;Oleg Dubovik;Jhoon Kim;Hans Moosmüller,Light-absorbing black carbon and brown carbon components of smoke aerosol from DSCOVR EPIC measurements over North America and central Africa,"This paper introduces a retrieval algorithm to estimate two key absorbing components in smoke (black carbon and brown carbon) using DSCOVR EPIC measurements. Our analysis reveals distinct smoke properties, including spectral absorption, layer height, and black carbon and brown carbon, over North America and central Africa. The retrieved smoke properties offer valuable observational constraints for modeling radiative forcing and informing health-related studies. 
 Wildfires and agricultural burning generate seemingly increasing smoke aerosol emissions, impacting societal and natural ecosystems. To understand smoke's effects on climate and public health, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of smoke aerosols, focusing on two major light-absorbing components, namely black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) aerosols. Using NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument aboard NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft, we inferred BC and BrC volume fractions and particle mass concentrations based on spectral absorption provided by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm with 1–2 h temporal resolution and ∼ 10 km spatial resolution over North America and central Africa. Our analyses of regional smoke properties reveal distinct characteristics for aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 443 nm, spectral single-scattering albedo (SSA), aerosol layer height (ALH), and BC and BrC amounts. Smoke aerosols in North America showed extremely high AOD up to 6, with elevated ALH (6–7 km) and significant BrC components up to 250 mg m−2 along the transport paths, whereas the smoke aerosols in central Africa exhibited stronger light absorption (i.e., lower SSA) and lower AOD, resulting in higher-BC mass concentrations and similar BrC mass concentrations than the cases in North America. Seasonal burning source locations in central Africa, following the seasonal shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and diurnal variations in smoke amounts, were also captured. A comparison of retrieved AOD443, SSA443, SSA680, and ALH with collocated AERONET and CALIOP measurements shows agreement with RMSE values of 0.2, 0.03–0.04, 0.02–0.04, and 0.8–1.3 km, respectively. An analysis of the spatiotemporal average reveals distinct geographical characteristics in smoke properties closely linked to burning types and meteorological conditions. Forest wildfires over western North America generated smoke with a small-BC volume fraction of 0.011 and a high ALH with large variability (2.2 ± 1.2 km), whereas smoke from wildfires and agricultural burning over Mexico region shows more absorption and low ALH. Smoke from savanna fires over central Africa had the most absorption, with a high-BC volume fraction (0.015) and low ALH with a small variation  (1.8 ± 0.6 km) among the analyzed regions. Tropical forest smoke was less absorbing and had a high variance in ALH. We also quantify the estimation uncertainties related to the assumptions of BC and BrC refractive indices. The MAIAC EPIC smoke properties with BC and BrC volume and mass fractions and assessment of the layer height provide observational constraints for radiative forcing modeling and air quality and health studies."

H. van Stratum;Chiel C. van Heerwaarden,The impact of coupled 3D shortwave radiative transfer on surface radiation and cumulus clouds over land,"Radiative transfer in the atmosphere is a 3D processes, which is often modelled in 1D for computational efficiency. We studied the differences between using 1D and 3D radiative transfer. With 3D radiation, larger clouds that contain more liquid water develop. However, they cover roughly the same part of the sky, and the average total radiation at the surface is nearly unchanged. The increase in cloud size might be important for weather models, as it can impact the formation of rain, for example. 
 Radiative transfer is a 3D process, but most atmospheric models consider radiation only in the vertical direction for computational efficiency. This results in inaccurate surface radiation fields, as the horizontal transport of radiation is neglected. Previous work on 3D radiative effects mainly used 3D radiative transfer uncoupled from the flow solver. In contrast, our current work uses 3D radiative transfer coupled to the flow solver to study its impact on the development of clouds and the resulting impact on the domain-averaged surface solar irradiance. To this end, we performed a series of realistic large-eddy simulations with MicroHH. To improve the level of realism of our radiation, we first included the direct effect of aerosols using aerosol data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global reanalysis. Next, we performed simulations with 1D radiative transfer and with a coupled ray tracer for 12 d on which shallow cumulus clouds formed over Cabauw, the Netherlands. In general, simulations with the coupled ray tracer have a higher domain-averaged liquid water path, larger clouds, and similar cloud cover compared to simulations with 1D radiative transfer. Furthermore, the domain-averaged direct radiation is decreased with 3D radiative transfer, and the diffuse radiation is increased. However, the average difference in global radiation is less than 1 W m−2, as the increase in global radiation from uncoupled 3D radiative transfer is counterbalanced by a decrease in global radiation caused by changes in cloud properties."

Stephens;Geoff Dutton;Xin Lan;Roisin Commane;Yenny Gonzalez;Eric Kort,Observational and model evidence for a prominent stratospheric influence on variability in tropospheric nitrous oxide,"This study examines the drivers of interannual variability in tropospheric N2O. New insights are obtained from aircraft data and a chemistry–climate model that explicitly simulates stratospheric N2O. The stratosphere is found to be the dominant driver of N2O variability in the Northern Hemisphere, while both the stratosphere and El Niño cycles are important in the Southern Hemisphere. These results are consistent with known atmospheric dynamics and differences between the hemispheres. 
 The literature presents different views on how the stratosphere influences variability in surface nitrous oxide (N2O) and on whether that influence is outweighed by surface emission changes driven by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). These questions are investigated using a chemistry–climate model with a stratospheric N2O tracer; surface and aircraft-based N2O measurements; and indices for ENSO, polar lower stratospheric temperature (PLST), and the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The model simulates well-defined seasonal cycles in tropospheric N2O that are caused mainly by the seasonal descent of N2O-poor stratospheric air in polar regions with subsequent cross-tropopause transport and mixing. Similar seasonal cycles are identified in recently available N2O data from aircraft. A correlation analysis between the N2O atmospheric growth rate (AGR) anomaly in long-term surface monitoring data and the ENSO, PLST, and QBO indices reveals hemispheric differences. In the Northern Hemisphere, the surface N2O AGR is negatively correlated with winter (January–March) PLST. This correlation is consistent with an influence from the Brewer–Dobson circulation, which brings N2O-poor air from the middle and upper stratosphere into the lower stratosphere with associated warming due to diabatic descent. In the Southern Hemisphere, the N2O AGR is better correlated to QBO and ENSO indices. These different hemispheric influences on the N2O AGR are consistent with known atmospheric dynamics and the complex interaction of the QBO with the Brewer-Dobson circulation. More airborne surveys extending to the tropopause would help elucidate the stratospheric influence on tropospheric N2O, allowing for better understanding of surface sources."

This study presents a hand-labeled dataset of 100 PlanetScope images for surface water detection, spanning diverse biomes. We use this dataset to evaluate two state-of-the-art mapping methods. Results highlight performance variations across biomes, emphasizing the need for diverse, independent validation datasets to enhance the accuracy and reliability of satellite-based surface water monitoring techniques. 
 Effective monitoring of global water resources is increasingly critical due to climate change and population growth. Advancements in remote sensing technology, specifically in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, are revolutionizing water resource monitoring, leading to more frequent and high-quality surface water extent maps using various techniques such as traditional image processing and machine learning algorithms. However, satellite imagery datasets contain trade-offs that result in inconsistencies in performance, such as disparities in measurement principles between optical (e.g., Sentinel-2) and radar (e.g., Sentinel-1) sensors and differences in spatial and spectral resolutions among optical sensors. Therefore, developing accurate and robust surface water mapping solutions requires independent validations from multiple datasets to identify potential biases within the imagery and algorithms. However, high-quality validation datasets are expensive to build, and few contain information on water resources. For this purpose, we introduce a globally sampled, high-spatial-resolution dataset labeled using 3 m PlanetScope imagery (Planet Team, 2017). Our surface water extent dataset comprises 100 images, each with a size of 1024×1024 pixels, which were sampled using a stratified random sampling strategy covering all 14 biomes. We highlighted urban and rural regions, lakes, and rivers, including braided rivers and coastal regions. We evaluated two surface water extent mapping methods using our dataset – Dynamic World (Brown et al., 2022), based on Sentinel-2, and the NASA IMPACT model (Paul and Ganju, 2021), based on Sentinel-1. Dynamic World achieved a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 72.16 % and F1 score of 79.70 %, while the NASA IMPACT model had a mean IoU of 57.61 % and F1 score of 65.79 %. Performance varied substantially across biomes, highlighting the importance of evaluating models on diverse landscapes to assess their generalizability and robustness. Our dataset can be used to analyze satellite products and methods, providing insights into their advantages and drawbacks. Our dataset offers a unique tool for analyzing satellite products, aiding the development of more accurate and robust surface water monitoring solutions.

 The direction and magnitude of soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) change following land use and land cover change (LULCC) are highly uncertain, largely due to the lack of relevant global soil data. Great efforts have been made to build SOCS database at regional, national and even sub-continental scales following LULCC; however, a comprehensive and open-access global database has not yet been developed, hindering a deep understanding of LULCC impact on SOCS dynamics.

Theoretically, when ULF waves propagate into the ionosphere as Alfvén waves, they can accelerate electrons and generate discrete auroras. However, what types of aurora can be driven by HSJs and what are the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using coordinated magnetosheath in situ and ground observations, here, we showed that when a HSJ was identified in the magnetosheath, multiple auroral arcs parallel to the auroral oval were observed near local noon. The electron energy spectrogram of these arcs exhibited “inverted‐V” structures, indicating the existence of quasi‐static parallel electric fields. Concurrently, long‐period ULF signals were detected on the ground, suggesting the arrival of Alfvén waves. These observations are represented by a kinetic simulation using realistic observational inputs, showing consistency with the theory regarding the generation of the “inverted‐V” structure by long‐period Alfvén waves. This study builds a previously unestablished connection among HSJ, ULF wave, and aurora, and provides a mechanism for generation of discrete auroral arcs near local noon, which may reveal the underlying mechanism behind a specific auroral activity commonly observed near local noon as shown in the paper."

Henkes;Philip F. Place;John E. Mak,"Large, Negative Atmospheric Carbon Monoxide Clumped Isotope Values Result From Kinetic Isotope Fractionation, Tracing OH• Reactivity","Because of its global abundance and reactivity with hydroxyl radicals (OH•), tropospheric carbon monoxide indirectly impacts the lifetimes of other OH•‐reactive gases, in particular methane and reactive hydrocarbons. The origin and chemistry of atmospheric CO have been studied using stable isotopes. Both 13CO and C18O undergo isotopic fractionation during its main chemical loss reaction, CO + OH•. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for 13CO is mass dependent, with a value of ∼5‰; 12CO reacts faster than 13CO with OH. Whereas C18O + OH• exhibits an inversely mass dependent KIE ∼−10‰. We hypothesize these KIEs result in a relative depletion of 13C18O, a CO clumped isotope. To test this, we collected CO from air samples on Long Island, NY, and discovered a −3 to −8‰ difference in the clumped isotope ratio, Δ31, relative to a random distribution of 13C and 18O in CO. A clear negative trend between [CO] and Δ31 is driven by two factors: (a) the atmospheric addition of CO from either a primary or secondary source with a Δ31 of ∼0‰ and (b) the continuing reaction of CO with OH•, leaving the remaining CO pool relatively depleted in 13C18O. This is analogous to the mechanism that determines CO Δ17O values. This study is among the first to show clumped isotope fractionation resulting from atmospheric chemistry and not thermal equilibration, which may inform the identification of clumped isotope KIEs in other atmospheric trace gases. These first Δ31 observations motivate future experimental and observational studies targeted at characterizing the clumped isotopes of CO sources, background CO, and experimentally fractionated CO."

Roberts,The Relative Role of Indian and Pacific Tropical Heating as Seasonal Predictability Drivers for the North Atlantic Oscillation,"Understanding the predictability drivers for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during boreal winter at seasonal time scales remains challenging. This study uses large ensembles with the ECMWF seasonal forecasting system to investigate the relative impact of tropical Indian and Pacific heating on NAO predictability by examining the tropical forcing, teleconnection pathways, and sources of uncertainty. We select three case studies ‐ 1997/98, 2015/16 and 2019/20 ‐ with strong Indian Ocean heating anomalies, but with different El Niño conditions. We show that in 2019/20, with neutral ENSO conditions, Indian Ocean SSTs favor a positive NAO response via stratospheric and tropospheric pathways. In the cases with strong El Niño, we find contrasting results: in 1997/98, the Pacific forcing dominates, producing a negative NAO. In 2015/16, despite the strong El Niño, the Indian Ocean forcing dominates, leading to a positive NAO via intensification of the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV). While the stratospheric pathway exhibits varying responses to Indian Ocean forcing ‐ being weaker in 1997/98 and strongest in 2015/16, the Indian Ocean‐related tropospheric pathway remains robust along the Pacific subtropical jet across years. However, there is destructive interference between teleconnections from Indian and Pacific SST anomalies in both the tropospheric and stratospheric pathways. The competing effects of tropical heating in both basins, uncertainties in the Rossby wave response to tropical heating and SPV variability contribute to uncertainty in seasonal NAO predictions. The flow‐dependent nature of the stratospheric pathway underscores the complexity of seasonal forecast predictability, and the existence of windows of opportunity."

Although alterations in precipitation intensity are well documented, past studies examining changes in spatio‐temporal distribution of storms (storm rainrates) were region‐specific and focused on isolated aspects of change in space or time, eluding a comprehensive understanding of the precise nature and extent of these changes. Bridging this gap, this study introduces a novel grid‐based measure of storm homogeneity, “spatio‐temporal homogeneity” metric and investigates the global patterns of change in combined spatio‐temporal characteristics of extreme storms. Analyzing the 30 min × 0.1° × 0.1° resolution Global Precipitation Measurements, the study finds that extreme storms are shrinking in both space and time due to rising surface air temperatures, predominantly in tropics. In contrast, temperate regions experience expanded extreme storms with increasing temperatures. The study also identifies a global trend toward more front‐loading in storms with rising temperatures, driven by a substantial increase in tropics and southern temperate regions. Conversely, storms in northern temperate regions become slightly more rear‐loaded as temperature increases. Furthermore, the study finds that characteristics of short–duration storms (6–12 hr) are more sensitive to temperature changes. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights into the global spatio‐temporal changes of extreme storms, highlighting regions most susceptible to alterations in storm patterns due to climate change. These findings are essential for developing effective adaptation strategies and flood management practices to cope with the changing nature of extreme storms in a warming climate."

 Crop translational genomics applies breeding techniques based on genomic datasets to improve crops. Technological breakthroughs in the past ten years have made it possible to sequence the genomes of increasing numbers of crop varieties and have assisted in the genetic dissection of crop performance. However, translating research findings to breeding applications remains challenging. Here we review recent progress and future prospects for crop translational genomics in bringing results from the laboratory to the field. Genetic mapping, genomic selection and sequence-assisted characterization and deployment of plant genetic resources utilize rapid genotyping of large populations. These approaches have all had an impact on breeding for qualitative traits, where single genes with large phenotypic effects exert their influence. Characterization of the complex genetic architectures that underlie quantitative traits such as yield and flowering time, especially in newly domesticated crops, will require further basic research, including research into regulation and interactions of genes and the integration of genomic approaches and high-throughput phenotyping, before targeted interventions can be designed. Future priorities for translation include supporting genomics-assisted breeding in low-income countries and adaptation of crops to changing environments.

 Cryogenic electron tomography is a technique for imaging biological samples in 3D. A microscope collects a series of 2D projections of the sample, and the goal is to reconstruct the 3D density of the sample called the tomogram. Reconstruction is difficult as the 2D projections are noisy and can not be recorded from all directions, resulting in a missing wedge of information. Tomograms conventionally reconstructed with filtered back-projection suffer from noise and strong artefacts due to the missing wedge. Here, we propose a deep-learning approach for simultaneous denoising and missing wedge reconstruction called DeepDeWedge. The algorithm requires no ground truth data and is based on fitting a neural network to the 2D projections using a self-supervised loss. DeepDeWedge is simpler than current state-of-the-art approaches for denoising and missing wedge reconstruction, performs competitively and produces more denoised tomograms with higher overall contrast.

We also found a strong correlation between V. cholerae genomic traits and disease severity, with some traits overlapping those driving lineage transmission. GSMM and 3D structure analysis unveiled a complex interplay between transcription regulation, protein interaction and stability, and metabolic networks, associated to lifestyle adaptation, intestinal colonization, acid tolerance and symptom severity.

 H2O transforms to two forms of superionic (SI) ice at high pressures and temperatures, which contain highly mobile protons within a solid oxygen sublattice. Yet the stability field of both phases remains debated. Here, we present the results of an ultrafast X-ray heating study utilizing MHz pulse trains produced by the European X-ray Free Electron Laser to create high temperature states of H2O, which were probed using X-ray diffraction during dynamic cooling. We confirm an isostructural transition during heating in the 26-69 GPa range, consistent with the formation of SI-bcc. In contrast to prior work, SI-fcc was observed exclusively above ~50 GPa, despite evidence of melting at lower pressures. The absence of SI-fcc in lower pressure runs is attributed to short heating timescales and the pressure-temperature path induced by the pump-probe heating scheme in which H2O was heated above its melting temperature before the observation of quenched crystalline states, based on the earlier theoretical prediction that SI-bcc nucleates more readily from the fluid than SI-fcc. Our results may have implications for the stability of SI phases in ice-rich planets, for example during dynamic freezing, where the preferential crystallization of SI-bcc may result in distinct physical properties across mantle ice layers. The authors perform heating experiments using femtosecond X-ray free electron laser pulses to explore the phase stability of superionic H2O.

 Cytotherapy is a strategy to deliver modified cells to a diseased tissue, but targeting solid tumours remains challenging. Here we design macrophages, harbouring a surface glypican-3-targeting peptide and carrying a cargo to combat solid tumours. The anchored targeting peptide facilitates tumour cell recognition by the engineered macrophages, thus enhancing specific targeting and phagocytosis of tumour cells expressing glypican-3. These macrophages carry a cargo of the TLR7/TLR8 agonist R848 and INCB024360, a selective indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor, wrapped in C16-ceramide-fused outer membrane vesicles (OMV) of Escherichia coli origin (RILO). The OMVs facilitate internalization through caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and to maintain a suitable nanostructure, C16-ceramide induces membrane invagination and exosome generation, leading to the release of cargo-packed RILOs through exosomes. RILO-loaded macrophages exert therapeutic efficacy in mice bearing H22 hepatocellular carcinomas, which express high levels of glypican-3.

 The dominant chemistries of lithium-ion batteries on the market today still rely on flammable organic liquid electrolytes and cathodes containing scarce metals, such as cobalt or nickel, raising safety, cost and environmental concerns. Here we show a FeCl3 cathode that costs as little as 1% of the cost of a LiCoO2 cathode or 2% of a LiFePO4 cathode. Once coupled with a solid halide electrolyte and a lithium-indium (Li–In) alloy anode, it enables all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries without any liquid components. Notably, FeCl3 exhibits two flat voltage plateaux between 3.5 and 3.8 V versus Li+/Li, and the solid cell retains 83% of its initial capacity after 1,000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.95%. Combined neutron diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations reveal a Li-ion (de)intercalation mechanism together with a Fe2+/Fe3+ redox process. Our work provides a promising avenue for developing sustainable battery technologies with a favourable balance of performance, cost and safety. The authors present a FeCl3 cathode design that enables all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries with a favourable combination of low cost, improved safety and good performance."

 Organic peroxy radicals (RO2) and Criegee intermediates (CI, carbonyl oxides) are key reactive species in atmospheric chemistry, and can proceed various reactions influencing the recycling of radicals and the formation of aerosol particles. Carbonyl oxides have recently detected in the OH-initiated autoxidation reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons. However, their formation mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, the β-hydroxyperoxy radicals (HO-RO2) are selected as the model compounds to study the mechanism of their transformation to carbonyl oxides. Potential formation pathways of carbonyl oxides, including unimolecular decomposition, bimolecular reactions with OH radicals, HO-RO and HO-RO2 radicals, are studied by using quantum chemical methods. The results show that the unimolecular decomposition of HO-RO2 radicals undergoes through the direct cleavage of C-C bond to produce carbonyl oxides, but they are strongly endothermic. For the reactions of HO-RO2 with OH radicals, the preferable pathway is the barrierless formation of ROOOH on the single PES, and their stability increases with increasing the number of methyl substituents. On the triplet PES, the formation of carbonyl oxides from H-abstraction reaction in the –CHx group is favorable for the unsubstituted and a methyl substituted HO-RO2 radicals. For the reactions of HO-RO2 with HO-RO radicals, the dominant pathway is the barrierless formation of ROOOR on the singlet PES, with dissociation back to the separate reactants being the lowest-energy pathway. The formation of carbonyl oxides is preferable on the triplet PES, and the methyl substitution is beneficial for decreasing the reaction barriers. The barrier for the formation of carbonyl oxides from the self-reaction of HO-RO2 radicals significantly decrease with increasing the number of methyl substituents. The self-reaction of dimethyl substituted HO-RO2 radicals forming (CH3)2COO is able to compete effectively with the bimolecular reactions with HO2 radicals. These findings enhance our understanding of the formation of carbonyl oxides from the photochemical oxidation of alkenes."

The results show that the MV in this process was initially born at a height of 0.9–2.4 km, and the contracting and stretching vertical vortex rapidly descended to surface from the 2.0 km height with the rotation speed increasing rapidly. Six minutes later, the extreme wind occurred. The generation mechanism of the MV is that, under the strong vertical wind shear and downdraft in the lower troposphere, the vertical vortex tube of MV was transformed from the horizontal vortex tube generated in the zone of perturbation temperature gradient. The influence mechanism of MV on the extreme wind is that, as the MV continued to intensify and extend downward, a negative perturbation low-pressure center formed in the lower troposphere near the MV. Meanwhile, the descending rear-inflow jet (RIJ) was blocked by the prefrontal upward motion and a positive perturbation high-pressure center formed at around 1 km height. The violent positive-negative couplets of perturbation pressure gradient produced a downward nonhydrostatic perturbation pressure gradient force (NPPGF) that further intensified the vertical downward velocity. In addition to the strong downdraft velocity, the Coriolis force also enhanced the formation of the extreme wind through the action of ageostrophic winds. Besides, this paper also compares the mechanism of this process with that of a typical bow echo MV and the extreme wind it affected."

 On 7–8 August 2017, a rare nocturnal overshooting convection (OC) and torrential precipitation event occurred in the Sichuan Basin (SCB) of Southwest China. This event was mainly caused by a mesoscale northerly low-level jet (MNLLJ), rather than the usual southerly low-level jet. According to the momentum budget equation, the spatiotemporal variations of the MNLLJ were primarily dominated by meridional pressure gradient force. In this study, the roles of MNLLJ on the OC from dynamic and thermodynamic perspectives were investigated using multi-source observations and a high-resolution weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. From dynamic perspectives, the MNLLJ acted as a low-level side-inflow for convective systems. Under the topographical convergence and uplift effects, the MNLLJ perpendicular to the mountain triggered low-level convections and precipitation in the Dalou Mountains. Meanwhile, the MNLLJ coupled with upper-altitude gale to furnish an auspicious condition of low/upper-level convergence/divergence for the formation of OC. From thermodynamic perspectives, the nocturnal formation of convective instability by the MNLLJ-related advection and lifting effects was a crucial factor for the local rapidly growing convective systems. In addition, the MNLLJ provided the horizontal convergence and vertical transportation of local moisture for it. The high-altitude peak of diabatic heating also contributed to the enhancement of the averaged vertical wind velocity with a maximum over 0.3 m∙s−1. Other factors affecting OC were also discussed, including mesoscale convective vortex, upper-tropospheric ageostrophic aspiration, westerly trough, and South Asian High. A conceptual framework for the formation and maintenance of OC is established."
