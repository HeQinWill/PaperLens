Single-cell proteins provide another option, but heterotrophic bacteria emit CO2 during production, and the production by alga protein is restricted by light supply. Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) can use reduced sulfur and CO2 to synthesize bacterial protein with a high methionine content, which can be used as a supplement to animal feed. So SOB are potential protein producers coupled with CO2 utilization. However, their efficiency is still low compared to heterotrophic bacteria and alga, which should be further enhanced through energy optimization and metabolic regulation."

However, in natural scenarios, minerals barely exist in their pure phases. Minerals are often associated with organic matter and form organo-mineral complexes (OMCs), exhibiting different reactivity than their pure mineral phase. In this study, we investigated the impact of ferrihydrite, its weathering-originated secondary mineral goethite, and their corresponding OMCs, i.e., organo-ferrihydrite (O-Fh) and organo-goethite (O-Goe) on NPs mobility under varying environmental conditions (ionic strength, pH, and river water). Results showed higher sorption capacity of minerals compared to their respective OMCs for NPs, i.e., ferrihydrite (529.62 mg/g), O-Fh (439.08 mg/g), goethite (823.64 mg/g), and O-Goe (688.88 mg/g). Zeta potential and sedimentation kinetic studies suggested higher heteroaggregation and coagulation in the goethite-NPs bimodal system. NPs-minerals/OMCs interaction mechanisms were confirmed by FTIR and XPS analysis. Column transport experiments and DLVO analysis revealed that minerals/OMCs coated sand showed higher NPs retention than bare quartz sand under different pore water chemistry. Ferrihydrite and goethite coated sand columns have shown maximum NPs retention (>95%). Our study provides insight into how environmentally relevant mineral phases and thier corresponding OMCs impact NPs fate and transport in aqueous and terrestrial environments."

Abbatt,The Yield of Oxygenated VOCs from Ozone Deposition on Aged Indoor Surfaces,"Ozone (O3) loss on surfaces forms oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) that can cause adverse health effects. Previous studies have focused on surface ozonolysis of pure unsaturated compounds on impermeable surfaces, whereas other work has addressed this chemistry in genuine indoor environments. Our goal is to bridge this gap by examining O3 loss and OVOC production on glass and paint in both laboratory experiments, using surfaces purposefully contaminated with pure compounds (squalene, triolein), complex oils (skin, olive), and surfaces that were aged in an occupied apartment. Paint was chosen as a permeable and reactive material, which is the most common indoor surface. It was found that paint aged indoors had lower OVOC yields than glass when exposed to O3, probably because O3 reacts with paint materials rather than with deposited organics. Many OVOCs were measured, including common skin oil ozonolysis products such as acetone, 6-MHO, and 4-OPA; however, the OVOCs with the highest yields from the apartment samples were nonanal and hexanal, with the OVOC levels highly correlated with the amount of cooking that occurred. Experiments using pure compounds and complex oils produce OVOC species similar to those observed on surfaces aged in the apartment."

Unlike conventional MD, IH-MD heats locally between the hydrophobic membrane and saline water to enhance the vapor flux and minimize heat loss. However, a unified understanding of the performance of various IH-MD systems remains lacking. Stability challenges such as membrane wetting, scaling, fouling, and corrosion caused by the introduction of heating materials pose significant obstacles to industrial application. This review critically examined recent advances in interfacial heating methods, including photothermal, Joule, conduction, and induction heating. Photothermal approaches offer sustainability and improved energy efficiency but are limited by sunlight exposure and adsorption, while electrothermal methods provide stable interfacial heating flux at the cost of higher energy use and potential material degradation. Strategies to enhance energy performance and durability are discussed in detail, such as combining multiple heating methods, refining module and configuration designs, optimizing membrane properties, and adjusting operating conditions. We also assessed the economic viability of IH-MD for industrial applications. While IH-MD faces challenges related to material durability, system complexity, and scale-up, its ability to eliminate thermal polarization, reduce energy consumption, and enable integration with renewable energy sources positions it as a transformative approach for future sustainable desalination and water purification technologies. This review aims to bridge the knowledge gaps between scientific innovation and real-world applications of various IH-MD technologies."

Herein, a charge-enhanced electrically responsive membrane with a tunable pore size is prepared to investigate the impact of the Donnan effect on ion transport in negative nanochannels of varying sizes. Both the Donnan effect and pore size changes influence ion transport within nanochannels, with an enhanced Donnan effect promoting cation transport while slowing anion permeation. The combined effect of the electrostatic interaction and steric sieving expands the membrane rejection adjustment range from 9.6% to 27.6%, as the applied voltage simultaneously decreases pore size and increases Donnan exclusion. The reduction in pore size enhances the ability of the per unit of Donnan potential to regulate ion transport, and electrostatic exclusion is more pronounced in smaller nanochannels. The same conclusion is confirmed in commercial nanofiltration membranes of varying sizes (NF270 and NF800), but as the nanochannel size decreases further (NF90), the effect of electrostatic interaction on ion transport becomes minimal. Since the nanochannels are too narrow to permit ion transport, size sieving becomes the dominant mechanism for selective separation. This work enhances our understanding of ion transport in nanochannels and supports the development of high-performance nanofiltration membranes."

N-fixing microorganisms are essential for nutrient accumulation and plant colonization in degraded habitats. However, the oligotrophic conditions of tailings often inhibit the energy-intensive N-fixing process. This study identified a chemolithoautotrophic Sb(III) oxidation-coupled nitrogen fixation (SbNF) pathway in the rhizosphere of local plants. SbNF integrates biological detoxification and nutrient accumulation, enabling plant colonization and ecological restoration of degraded habitats. Multi-omic analyses reveal that Sb content strongly shapes the composition of Sb-oxidizing and N-fixing bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Abundant marker genes for carbon fixation (cbbL), Sb(III) oxidase (aioAB/anoA), and nitrogenase (nifH) were consistently detected in SbNF metagenome-assembled genomes. Positive correlations between gene abundances associated with autotrophic potential (aioA-cbbL) and coupling potential (aioA-nifH) were observed in the rhizoplane but not in the endosphere. In addition to genetic potentials, high-throughput cultivation of native SbNF-isolates (e.g., Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas) confirmed their rapid Sb(III) oxidation coupling autotrophic growth and nitrogen fixation. Isolates also exhibited plant growth-promoting traits, including indole-3-acetic acid production, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore secretion, providing multiple benefits to host plants. Co-cultivation of these isolates revealed minimal antagonism, suggesting the potential for designing synthetic microbial communities for sustainable phytoremediation. Cross-validation further suggests that SbNF is widespread in the rhizosphere of various local plants. These findings uncover a novel biogeochemical process in the rhizosphere, linking mineral oxidation, autotrophic growth, and nitrogen fixation, highlighting its importance for the ecological restoration of degraded tailing area."

With the original goal of constraining natural CO2 $\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{2}}$ fluxes at regional to global scales, these instruments have now become popular tools for studying anthropogenic emissions from cities around the world. As signatories of the Paris Climate Agreement are expected to produce nationally determined contributions (NDC) to global carbon emissions, continued monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of these estimates will be essential. While the use of OCO‐2 and OCO‐3 missions for MRV purposes is increasing, several physical and environmental factors limit data collection. Using the continental United States as a test case, the influences of orbital mechanics and environmental factors on local‐ and national‐level emissions estimates are explored through a series of linear and multi‐linear regressions to predict each instrument's effective revisit time. Results suggest that, due to environmental factors, western regions of the U.S. are more likely to be constrained at a sub‐annual scale than eastern regions, with effective instrument revisit times <30 ${< } 30$ days. East coast cities have effective revisit times >30 ${ >} 30$ days; however, this varies seasonally. The characteristics of the instruments' orbits also vary the frequency of urban observations in both space and time. Implications for observation‐derived emission estimates at local and national scales and remedies for such shortcomings in future missions are discussed."

Leveraging unique radar wind profiler network measurements across three Beijing during the record‐breaking 2023 summer (16 HW days), we quantify the turbulence dissipation rate (ε) variations under anticyclone driven HWs (hereafter called Type AC, 40% dominance). The mean ε in the PBL during HWs is elevated by ∼55%, demonstrating heat‐amplified turbulence. Divergent forcing regimes emerges–surface‐air temperature difference (Ts−Ta) governs PBL turbulence generation while vertical wind shear (VWS) dominates mechanical mixing aloft. Intriguingly, clouds play a dual role: they enhance VWS‐induced turbulence under normal conditions but reduce heat driven turbulence. These findings establish the first observational evidence of synoptic‐scale thermal‐dynamic decoupling in urban PBLs during extreme heat, providing mechanistic insights for improving megacity air quality forecasting and heat‐stress resilience strategies."

In this study, using Van Allen Probe A observations, we present several rising‐tone EMIC wave events to reveal the downward frequency chirping between adjacent subpackets. By performing a hybrid simulation, we demonstrate for the first time that these wave properties are associated with the oscillation of proton holes in the wave gyrophase space induced by cyclotron resonance. The oscillation modulates the energy transfer between waves and particles, establishing a direct link between subpacket formation in cyclotron waves and nonlinear wave‐particle interactions.

We validate TECprobe-LM by measuring known folding events that occur within the E. coli signal recognition particle RNA, Clostridium beijerinckii pfl ZTP riboswitch, and Bacillus cereus crcB fluoride riboswitch folding pathways. Our findings establish TECprobe-LM as a strategy for observing cotranscriptional RNA folding events directly using chemical probing. Cotranscriptional RNA folding pathways often involve the sequential formation of folding intermediates as RNA emerges from an RNA polymerase. Here the authors develop an RNA chemical probing method that directly measures the cotranscriptional rearrangement of nascent RNA structures."

 We present a photonic engine that processes both optical and microwave signals, and can convert signals between the two domains. Our photonic chip, fabricated in IMEC’s iSiPP50G silicon photonics process, is capable of both generation and detection of analog electrical and optical signals, and can program user-defined filter responses in both domains. This single chip integrates all essential photonic integrated components like modulators, optical filters, and photodetectors, as well as tunable lasers enabled by transfer-printed indium phosphide optical amplifiers. This makes it possible to operate the chip as a black-box microwave photonics processor, where the user can process high-frequency microwave signals without being exposed to inner optical operation of the chip. The system’s configuration is locally programmed through thermo-optic phase shifters and monitored by photodetectors, and can select any combination of optical or microwave inputs and outputs. We construct multiple systems with this engine to demonstrate its capabilities for different RF and optical signal processing functions, including optical and RF signal generation and filtering. This represents a key step towards compact and affordable microwave photonic systems that can enable higher-speed wireless communication networks and low-cost microwave sensing applications.

 With the increasing challenges posed by global warming and climate change, heat stress has become a significant threat to the sustainable production of grapevines. However, the genetic basis of grapevine thermotolerance remains poorly understood. Here, we combine genome-wide association study with transcriptomic profiling to identify TTC4 (thermotolerance on chromosome 4), a gene encoding a WRKY transcription factor, as a key determinant of thermotolerance in grapevine. TTC4 directly activates two thermotolerance-related genes, HSP18.1 and APX3. We also identify a heat-suppressed repressor SPL13 (SQUAMOSA-promoter binding protein-like 13) that cannot bind to the GTAT element (TTC4T(7631)) in intron 2 of TTC4, but can bind to the natural variant, GTAC (TTC4C(7631)). Grapevine accessions with TTC4C/C(7631) genotype exhibit significantly lower thermotolerance compared to those with the TTC4T/T(7631) and TTC4C/T(7631) genotypes. This fine-tuned regulation contributes to thermotolerance divergence among grapevine populations. The TTC4T(7631) haplotype holds significant potential as a genetic resource for breeding thermotolerant grapevine varieties. The genetic basis of grapevine thermotolerance remains poorly understood.

The authors show that TTYH1 mediates the endolysosomal processing of neuron-derived sphingolipids which controls autophagic flux and lipid droplet homeostasis. 
 Dynamic regulation of metabolic activities in astrocytes is critical to meeting the demands of other brain cells. During neuronal stress, lipids are transferred from neurons to astrocytes, where they are stored in lipid droplets (LDs). However, it is not clear whether and how neuron-derived lipids trigger metabolic adaptation in astrocytes. Here, we uncover an endolysosomal function that mediates neuron-astrocyte transcellular lipid signaling. We identify Tweety homolog 1 (TTYH1) as an astrocyte-enriched endolysosomal protein that facilitates autophagic flux and LD degradation. Astrocyte-specific deletion of mouse Ttyh1 and loss of its Drosophila ortholog lead to brain accumulation of neutral lipids. Computational and experimental evidence suggests that TTYH1 mediates endolysosomal clearance of ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), a sphingolipid that dampens autophagic flux and LD breakdown in mouse and human astrocytes. Furthermore, neuronal C1P secretion induced by inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β causes TTYH1-dependent autophagic flux and LD adaptations in astrocytes. These findings reveal a neuron-initiated signaling paradigm that culminates in the regulation of catabolic activities in astrocytes.

 Enhancing the durability of electrodes under high-power conditions is crucial for advancing high-power secondary batteries. Despite numerous optimization strategies proposed to mitigate electrode structural degradation, the performance of common electrodes inevitably deteriorates under high currents over extended cycling life. In this study, we report a capacity refreshing strategy for a porous organic framework electrode operating under high power conditions. By intermittently applying low currents, deactivated ions trapped within the framework can be effectively released, thus refreshing the electrode’s capacity. Importantly, this capacity refreshing can be periodically repeated. The framework electrode thus achieves an extended cycle life of over 60,000 cycles at 20 C (6 A/g) with a specific power of 28 kW/kg (based on active material). This strategy represents an alternative concept for designing organic electrodes that combine high power and long cycle life.

 The high occurrence of compound drought and heatwave events (CDHWs), driven by global climate change, poses a serious threat to humanity. However, their impacts on rural and urban populations remain unclear. This study analyzed CDHWs exposure in both rural and urban populations and found that the number of people chronically exposed to CDHWs has shown a clear upward trend over time. From 1901 to 2021, rural populations experienced 2.5 times the total exposure to CDHWs compared to urban populations. Over the past three decades, however, urban populations have experienced significantly higher exposure and a faster rate of increase than rural populations. Regionally, rural populations in Asia, North America, and Africa accounted for 41.06, 16.51, and 13.69% of the total global rural population exposure, respectively, while urban populations in Asia, North America, and Europe accounted for 32.31, 18.70, and 16.85% of global urban exposure, respectively.

 Observations show an Atlantification of the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, with deeper penetration, shoaling, and ventilation of Atlantic waters in the eastern Arctic and an associated weakening of the cold halocline layer. These processes have a profound impact on the sea ice cover above and potentially on the transition of the Arctic to a seasonal ice cover. Here we show, using a coupled ice-ocean model, that a proper simulation of the landfast ice cover in the relatively small but deeper peripheral Kara Sea has a disproportionately large influence on the halocline stability in the Eurasian Basin and beyond. Specifically, landfast ice in the Kara Sea reduces ice growth and therefore salt rejection into the surface ocean. This negative salinity anomaly is advected eastward with a coastal current along the continental shelf in the Makarov Basin and then out of the Arctic through Fram Strait by the Transpolar Drift Stream on timescales of less than ten years. Global Climate Models, however, do not yet include landfast ice parameterizations. Therefore, they are missing this key process affecting the halocline stability, Atlantification of the Makarov Basin, and potentially the timing of a seasonally ice-free Arctic.

 Mangrove forests’ restoration has gained traction as a sustainable solution to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and to provide ecosystem services, such as coastal protection. Restoration projects are often informed by expert judgment rather than a quantitative understanding and have a high failure rate. Monitoring mangrove restoration performance may take decades and has a strong case study dependency. To optimise restoration strategies, we developed an individual-based mangrove and process-based hydro-morphodynamic model to simulate multi-species mangrove forest trajectories, including the physical environment’s feedback. We find a significant impact of planting zonation on the mudflat behaviour, with seaward erosion and in-forest-landward deposition. Planting mangroves close to mean sea level decreases carbon storage potential due to increased mudflat erosion. Configuring planting in multiple patches proves beneficial to mangrove biomass development, expansion, and sediment accumulation. Combined with sound monitoring, the developed tool can potentially optimize planned mangrove restoration strategies.

 Forests are essential for climate stability, yet elevated ozone levels-exacerbated by poorly understood impacts of shipping-related nitrogen oxides, stress these ecosystems. Here we combine field sampling at a coastal site southeast of Hong Kong and numerical air quality modelling to analyze nitrogen oxides dynamics in marine and forested environments. Results show that marine air masses influenced by shipping emissions have a higher formation potential for isoprene nitrate (a nitrogen oxides reservoir) than high- nitrogen oxides urban areas like Beijing and Hong Kong. Shipping-derived nitrogen oxides is transported and recycled deep into forests, triggering a cascade that enhances ozone formation. Shipping-linked isoprene nitrate accounts for ~20% of total recycled nitrogen oxides and increases ozone by up to 1 part per billion. The study reveals that nitrogen oxides distribution is more spatially uniform than previously recognized due to these processes, with implications for regional-scale ozone management.

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimetry has been widely used for monitoring river water levels, especially over large and medium-sized rivers. However, challenges still remain in obtaining continuous and high-precision water levels over small rivers due to the altimeter's sparse along-track sampling, distorted waveforms, and river slopes. This study presents a new multi-parameter optimized sub-waveform (MulPOS) retracker, which retracks the waveforms across all cycles through a quantitatively considered integration of the spatial consistency and temporal continuity of water levels, river slopes, and the strong reflectivity of the river surface. Firstly, along-track sampling is increased by searching for off-nadir observations within half the sampling resolution from nadir water bodies to retrieve continuous river water levels. Secondly, waveform preprocessing, including interpolation and filtering is used to determine more accurate retracking points, and then all possible sub-waveform sets that correspond to river reflections are formed. The most likely sub-waveform sets are determined by their four-parameter weighting function, which considers spatial consistency, temporal continuity of water level variations, and the high reflectivity of the river water surface. Finally, slope corrections are computed using the robust Helmert variance component estimation method by combining the differences between water levels in adjacent cycles and along the track. The MulPOS has been applied to 290 virtual stations formed by Sentinel-3A/3B and Sentinel-6 MF over rivers in the United States (52 % of which are narrower than 100 m). For comparison purposes, six other retrackers have been used, including OCOG, ICE1, threshold, NPPTR, SAMOSA+, and MWaPP+. The results have been validated against the in-situ measurements from the United States Geological Survey, indicating that the water levels derived by MulPOS are superior to other retrackers with a median RMSE of 17.9 cm, a median relative RMSE of 7.2 %, a median correlation coefficient of 0.96, and an abnormal water level occurrence rate of 0.60 %, whereas the corresponding metrics for other retrackers are >24.2 cm, >9.8 %, <0.94, and > 2.36 %. Moreover, MulPOS achieves steady and high-precision water levels across most small rivers under varying river widths (e.g., RMSE for MulPOS is 20.9 cm vs. >29.5 cm for other retrackers over rivers narrower than 50 m), varying angles between satellite ground tracks and rivers, and complex river morphologies. MulPOS is expected to generate a dataset with continuous, high-precision water level data for more small and medium-sized rivers, and this will expand the application of altimetry to inland water monitoring."

 Vicarious calibration/validation (Cal/Val) is essential for ensuring the radiometric accuracy of spaceborne thermal infrared (TIR) sensors. Anticipating an increase in the number of TIR sensors in the near future, this study developed an automated vicarious radiometric validation method based on in situ water temperature measurements from 14 sites in lakes and bays across Japan, which are not specifically dedicated to Cal/Val of satellite sensors. In addition, we applied a contextual image classification model based on the Swin Transformer architecture to create a fully automated filtering procedure to remove cloudy data. The proposed methods were developed and evaluated using the data acquired by well-calibrated satellite sensors, namely Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Thermal Infrared Radiometer (ASTER TIR), Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), and Landsat 9 TIRS-2, as reference targets. To develop a contextual image classification model, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Swin Transformer model with our own training data comprising 921,967 chip images created from ASTER TIR band 13 and Landsat 8 TIRS band 10 images selected from global regions. The developed image classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 96.20 %. However, when applied only to the study areas, the accuracy decreased to 94.85 %, because all the target sites were exclusively located in lakes and bays. The classification model was localized to our study areas by adjusting the probability threshold. Combining contextual image classification with quantitative thresholds, the model successfully classified 90 % of the cloud-free daytime ASTER data and Landsat 8 data. The accuracy for cloud-free classification was 81 % and 86 % for nighttime ASTER data and Landsat 9 data, respectively. Consequently, 169, 58, 500, and 130 matchups were automatically identified for daytime ASTER, nighttime ASTER, Landsat 8, and Landsat 9, respectively. The in situ water temperature for each matchup was converted to top-of-atmosphere brightness temperature (TOA BT) through radiative transfer calculations. In situ-based and satellite-based TOA BT agreed very well within the residual bias error of less than ±0.4 K except for nighttime ASTER data that seemed to be affected by insufficient skin temperature correction. The correlation between in situ-based and satellite-based TOA BT was strong, with R2 values ranging from 0.97 to 0.99, for daytime and nighttime ASTER, Landsat 8, and Landsat 9. The statistically estimated offsets between the in situ-based and satellite-based TOA BT were nearly equivalent to previously reported Cal/Val result and within the acceptable range of the sensors’ requirements, indicating that our method and data are suitable for the radiometric validation of spaceborne TIR sensors."

 Building height serves as fundamental information for characterizing urban landscapes and morphology, as influencing various aspects of the urban environment. While traditional methods of obtaining building height are often limited by spatial coverage and proprietary constraints, remote sensing data provides an alternative for indirect estimation. Several height products developed across different spatial scales, yet challenges remain due to the spatial and temporal incompleteness of publicly available building height samples, which introduce inherent uncertainties in global height mapping. This study proposed an improved approach for building height sampling that combines the ALOS AW3D30 and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) data. Both datasets are open-access, providing a more comprehensive and representative sample base for model construction. To address temporal discrepancies between these two data, continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm was employed to remove invalid height samples. Subsequently, we trained random forest (RF) models using a combination of multi-source remote sensing data, including radar data, optical data, nighttime light data, terrain data, and footprint data, to generate a global urban building height map for the year of 2020. Reference samples from Europe, the United States, and China were employed to validate the model, indicating a high degree of consistency between the references and estimated results (R2 = 0.55–0.75, RMSE = 4.71–10.07 m).

Validation statistics at 18,876 sample locations demonstrated strong performance for both CC (R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.13) and WV (OA = 0.94, Kappa = 0.87) when using both S1 and S2 variables for prediction. The small improvement in statistical performance provided by SAR variables (typically 1–2 % for CC and WV) understated the benefits of S1 for discriminating woody vegetation and quantifying canopy cover in non-woody ecosystems (e.g., alpine vegetation, heathlands, wetlands, coastal scrub), demonstrating the complementary benefits of multi-sensor prediction. The emergence and growth of natural capital accounting and frameworks such as the Nature Positive Initiative, mean that high-quality, cost-effective spatial datasets will continue to be in demand. Our study demonstrates the potential of non-commercial, publicly accessible remote sensing imagery to improve fine-scale analyses that may otherwise be cost-prohibitive to apply at scale."

10.1126/sciadv.adv1071,False,Science Advances,该研究论文主要关注食品防腐剂山梨酸盐对哺乳动物细胞和组织中赖氨酸山梨酰化(Ksor)的影响，以及这种修饰如何通过I类组蛋白去乙酰化酶(HDAC1-3)的非典型活性来调节炎症基因的表达。研究发现山梨酸盐的摄取会诱导组蛋白Ksor，从而降低炎症反应基因的表达。此外，山梨酸盐处理还能剂量依赖性地降低巨噬细胞中促炎基因的表达和一氧化氮的产生。该研究还发现RelA是Ksor的靶标，山梨酸盐处理显著降低了NF-κB的转录活性。总的来说，这项研究揭示了山梨酸盐摄取在调节表观遗传组蛋白修饰和炎症基因表达中的一种非典型机制。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Yi-Cheng Sin;Breann Abernathy;Zuo-fei Yuan;Jason L.

Here, we report that cellular uptake of sorbate, a common food preservative, induces lysine sorbylation (Ksor) in mammalian cells and tissue mediated by the noncanonical activities of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC1-3). We demonstrated that HDAC1-3 catalyze sorbylation upon sorbate uptake and desorbylation in the absence of sorbate both in vitro and in cells. Sorbate uptake in mice livers significantly induced histone Ksor, correlating with decreased expressions of inflammation-response genes. Accordingly, sorbate treatment in macrophage RAW264.7 cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation dose-dependently down-regulated proinflammatory gene expressions and nitric oxide production. Proteomic profiling identified RelA, a component of the NF-κB complex, and its interacting proteins as bona fide Ksor targets and sorbate treatment significantly decreased NF-κB transcriptional activities in response to LPS stimulation in RAW264.7 cells. Together, our study demonstrated a noncanonical mechanism of sorbate uptake in regulating epigenetic histone modifications and inflammatory gene expression."
