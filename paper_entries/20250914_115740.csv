This work investigates the effects of copolyester chemical structure on soil biodegradability using 13C-labeled variants of polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) and polybutylene sebacate-co-terephthalate (PBSeT), as well as 13C-labeled cellulose as a positive biodegradation control. Biodegradation in soil was assessed by monitoring polyester and cellulose mineralization to 13CO2 throughout multimonth incubations and quantifying the nonmineralized polyester in the soil after incubations. Mass balances on polyester- and cellulose-added 13C over the incubations were closed. The soil biodegradability of PBSeT was higher than that of PBAT for variants with a molar ratio of terephthalate (T) to total diacid of 50%. PBAT biodegradability substantially increased as its T content decreased from 50% to 47, 30, 20, and 0%. Increasing biodegradability with decreasing T content also resulted in preferential biodegradation of aliphatic-rich domains in the initial phase of the incubations. Polyesters undergoing extensive mineralization also showed substantial incorporation of polyester carbon into the soil microbial biomass. Differences in polyester soil biodegradability were rationalized based on differences in their enzymatic hydrolyzability. Qualitative chemical structure-biodegradability relationships can lead to tailoring polyester biodegradability to specific applications and the biodegradation potentials of receiving environments."

This study examined how an antibiotic, a fungicide, and their mixture affect the prokaryotic and fungal gut microbiome in Gammarus fossarum via dietary, waterborne, and combined exposure. Antimicrobial exposure altered the relative abundance of bacterial classes, including Verrucomicrobiae, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, with effect directions depending on the antimicrobial. These structural shifts were predicted to enhance lipid and energy metabolism, particularly under dietary and combined exposure, potentially influencing host physiology. Previous studies on the same species reported up to 25% higher biomass gain under these exposure routes, whereas waterborne exposure had negligible effects. As this study primarily relies on predictive models linking microbiome shifts to physiological changes, experimental validation is required to substantiate these findings. Likewise, several fungal classes were affected, but limited knowledge of the mycobiome hinders functional interpretation. Overall, dietary uptake emerged as a key driver of gut microbiome changes, while waterborne exposure played a minor role in the metabolic and physiological responses. Future research should investigate the mycobiome alongside its prokaryotic counterpart for a more comprehensive understanding of the gut digestive profile of invertebrates as a whole and its role in host health."

Despite the intensive rates, recent studies have found deep O2 penetration underneath, extending down several meters. To investigate this anomaly, we applied a reactive transport model to simulate O2 supply and consumption for winter and summer conditions. Well-known conditions at a high-energy beach on Spiekeroog Island, Germany, were used to define topography, hydraulic conductivity, tide, and wave amplitudes, and the model was built using measured O2 distribution and O2 consumption rates. The tide-resolving model was capable of simulating the periodic tidal desaturation of the surface layer. We found that the aeration with atmospheric O2 during desaturation is a significant O2 source, contributing up to 30–60% of total O2 consumption. Meanwhile, seawater O2 quickly bypasses the upper reactive layer, extending the oxycline to depths of 11–16 m in the summer and winter, respectively. This mechanism mitigates the seasonal imprint into deeper layers yet promotes intensive aerobic OC remineralization of up to 0.7 gC m–2 d–1."

This study presents an in-depth suspect screening of PFAS in marine mussels and oysters from 23 sites along the French coasts, using aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) as reference materials. The approach proved effective in revealing precursors that may be metabolized by organisms of higher trophic levels. Overall, 79 PFAS across 29 classes were identified, including 15 classes (e.g., X:2 FTSAm) reported for the first time in marine biota. The use of AFFFs supported not only the detection of PFAS but also their structural annotation, notably by distinguishing per- from polyfluoroalkyl compounds. Several PFAS detected in bivalves, such as 6:2 diPAP and X:3 FTCA, were not found in AFFFs, which suggested the existence of alternative sources and/or environmental degradation processes. Spatial analysis revealed contrasting contamination profiles, in particular PFAS hotspots near industrialized and estuarine areas, and lower levels at less-industrialized sites or those further from the coast. Detection of currently unmonitored PFAS (e.g., 6:2 FTAB and FHxSA) at all sampling sites highlighted the urgent need to broaden the scope of PFAS studies for a more comprehensive environmental assessment."

While significant advances have been made in the discovery of novel materials that have innovative functionalities, rarely is attention provided to a holistic analysis to ensure that processes are sustainable. Rigorous analysis methodologies must be used to compare alternative processing methods. In this study, a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to evaluate a continuous and single-step aerosol synthesis approach in comparison to conventional batch pyrolysis methods for producing high-surface-area (porous) carbon materials. First, porous carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) are synthesized using a lab-scale aerosol reactor, and LCA is conducted to identify the key processing parameters contributing to their environmental impact. These results are then successfully used to guide the design of an optimized scaled-up aerosol reactor, achieving up to 75% reduction in global warming potential compared to conventional scaled-up batch pyrolysis techniques. Finally, the role of particle size and pyrolysis energy source in the environmental impact of CNP synthesis is systematically investigated. Overall, the simple (single-step, continuous, and rapid) operation and promising sustainability of the aerosol technique highlight its significant potential for the scalable synthesis of carbon nanomaterials from lignin."

While aqueous Fe(II)–magnetite interactions drive these environmentally critical redox reactions, the atomistic mechanisms governing electron transfer and isotopic exchange between aqueous Fe(II) and structural Fe(III) in magnetite during recrystallization remain elusive. Herein, this study combined Fe isotopic tracer experiments, 57Fe–Mössbauer spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural controls on Fe(II)-catalyzed magnetite recrystallization under circumneutral conditions. The results demonstrate that Fe(II)aq exchanges with structural Fe(III) in magnetite, with the extent increasing for smaller particle sizes and nonstoichiometric compositions. Mössbauer spectra demonstrate preferential Fe atom exchange at octahedral sites. Molecular simulations further identify the most stable surface configurations of Fe(II) on magnetite: a monodentate mononuclear inner-sphere complex at tetrahedral sites versus a tridentate inner-sphere complex (stabilized by cation bridging) at octahedral sites. Calculated desorption free energies (0.37 eV vs 0.67 eV) confirm stronger Fe(II) retention at octahedral sites. These mechanistic insights advance the fundamental understanding of Fe(II)-catalyzed mineral transformations and inform the rational design of magnetite-based  remediation strategies."

Herein, we developed atomically dispersed single-atom copper@carbon nanospheres (Cu-NC-3), which effectively decompose ozone (O3) to generate surface atomic oxygen (*O), as confirmed by the in situ Raman experiments and theoretical calculations. The *O species rapidly degrade 60% of oxalic acid (OA) within 1 min, while protonation of *O produces surface-confined hydroxyl radicals (•OHad) that achieve 94.7% removal of benzoic acid (BA) and other aromatic compounds. Compared to ozonation alone, the O3/Cu-NC-3 system enhances OA and BA removal by 34.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Atomic-level Cu dispersion induces carbon defects that enrich surface O3, and Cu–N4 coordination sites promote its conversion to *O and •OHad. This dual-oxidation mechanism effectively ensures and enables broad-spectrum pollutant removal and exceptional catalytic stability under long-term operation. Therefore, the O3/Cu-NC-3 system offers a robust and efficient approach for treating real wastewater containing diverse interfering species."

Herein, typical PAA catalytic activation systems were constructed, including metal ion-induced homogeneous and material-induced heterogeneous catalytic activation systems. The formation of •OH, alkyl radicals (•CH3), alkoxy radicals (CH3C(═O)OO• and CH3C(═O)O•), and nonradical species (1O2) was systematically studied and detected by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). In the homogeneous catalytic activation systems, the concentrations and types of generated radicals were dominated by the extranuclear electron configuration in the metal ions, while in the heterogeneous systems, carbon material showed lower efficiency in radical formation but directly produced 1O2 through double electron transfer. The activation performance of the photocatalyst was dominated by the reduction ability of photogenerated electrons and the oxidation ability of photogenerated holes. Furthermore, an EPR-based method for quantification of 1O2 was proposed by using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) or its derivatives, confirming that 1O2 was transformed from the self-decomposition of PAA or the Russell reaction of complexed CH3C(═O)OO•.

Significant differences in the optical properties of samples from 2016 to 2023 were identified based on the mass and mass ratios of the chemical components. For the BC–FS relationship in the data set used in this study, increased FS mass lowered FMF and dSSABC–FS (SSA440–SSA870) by approximately 0.033 and 0.005 per 1 μg/m3, respectively.

However, targeted analysis of a limited number of typical estrogens or estrogenic candidates is insufficient for key estrogenic driver identification since many estrogenic substances are poorly characterized or even unknown. In this study, chemometric methods were applied to link in vitro bioassays and nontarget analysis to identify key drivers of estrogenic effects in complex environmental mixtures. The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), which is located in the middle and upper Yangtze River and provides drinking water to over 7 million people, was selected as the study area. Sediment samples were collected during flood and nonflood period to investigate toxic effects and chemical distribution. Bioassays, including cytotoxicity tests and yeast two-hybrid tests, revealed that samples collected during the flood period induced significantly higher estrogenic effects than those from the nonflood period. Nontarget screening by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) detected 47,321 unique features, with 527 compounds being identified successfully (level 2a). Chemometric analysis by correlation and weighted contribution analysis indicated that N-[(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl]nonanamide (nonivamide) was significantly positively correlated with estrogenic activity (p < 0.05). Target analysis and the yeast two-hybrid assay confirmed that nonivamide induced up to 25.2% of the estrogenic effect of sediments at environmental concentrations. This study is the first report on nonivamide occurrence in environments and its unexpected estrogenic effects, highlighting its potential ecological and health implications."

The resulting free tropospheric aerosols may affect inference of ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), yet the effects of accounting for plume height in this inference are poorly understood. Here, we include in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model a fire plume height parametrization (GFAS, Global Fire Assimilation System) to examine its effect on PM2.5 inferred from satellite AOD during wildfires over the United States and Canada. Comparison with six years satellite observations of plume height reveals a low bias of a factor 1.7 in the GFAS plume height over evergreen needleleaf forests. We scale the GFAS plume height over evergreen needleleaf forests in GEOS-Chem to better represent the satellite observations, focusing on 2018 and 2020 when large wildfires yield prominent signals. Replacing the default ground-level wildfire emissions in GEOS-Chem with the scaled GFAS vertically distributed emissions reduces the bias between measured PM2.5 and PM2.5 inferred from satellite AOD, and significantly improves the consistency of simulated AOD with sun photometer measurements.

Our results show that fluctuating prompt penetration electric fields primarily drive the strong VTEC enhancement, while storm‐time meridional wind reversals cause prominent undulations. The model reproduces the VTEC obtained by a co‐located Digisonde. However, both the model and Digisonde underestimate GPS‐derived VTEC in the post‐noon sector, suggesting additional plasmaspheric contributions.

We used high‐frequency water temperature data (2007–2021) from nine sub‐alpine (>600 m ASL) lakes in the Northeastern US to investigate the drivers and coherence of ecologically important autumn processes. The end of summer stratification was highly variable across lakes and mediated by DOC and lake depth. The timing of end of stratification affected the onset of continuous autumn mixing; however, mixing was decoupled from ice‐on. Ice‐on was highly coherent and driven by air temperature. Extreme weather events with high winds, heavy precipitation, and anomalous air temperatures drove early onset of mixing, re‐stratification events, and freeze‐melt events. The variability of thermal structure during autumn demonstrates that climate change will not uniformly shift the start and end of autumn season later in the year."

To enable climate change adaptation and resilience across various economic and social sectors in this region, updated information about future climate changes, specifically at finer spatial scales, is essential. Leveraging a new 150‐year dynamical downscaling data set at convection‐permitting resolution, this study introduces a framework to construct the projected future intensity‐duration‐frequency (IDF) curves of heavy precipitation, which are prominent tools for infrastructure design and water resources management. This framework generates IDF curves at both sub‐daily and multi‐day duration utilizing hourly in situ observations as well as quantile‐based statistical techniques in bias‐correction and return levels selection. The assumption of non‐stationarity in the distribution parameter fitting process is also implemented in this workflow. Compared to historical IDF curves for 1980–2022, future projected IDF curves for 2058–2100 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios indicate an average intensity increase of approximately 15% and 25%, respectively, across 74 stations, considering both annual and seasonal timescales. Future projections suggest that extreme precipitation events may become more severe across six investigated return periods, with longer return periods showing a greater increase. The frequency of future extreme precipitation events in the Midwest region is also projected to double. Furthermore, current results reveal spatial heterogeneity of future trends across stations owing to the high‐resolution input data set."

Our simulations of hot lightning plasmas result in negligible thermal (due to ions) 337.0 nm optical emissions below 30 kA peak current. This indicates that 337.0 nm optical emissions detected by ASIM are mainly produced by lightning streamers instead of by thermally produced ionic lines in lightning.

By compositing temperature, water vapor, and tropical upwelling during different phases of QBO and QBO disruptions (XQBO), we show that XQBO events lead to cold anomalies (relative to WQBO winters) of as much as −4.6 K during April 2016 at 60 hPa and −3.9 K during December 2019 at 50 hPa. These cold anomalies initiate around 50 hPa and propagate downward, cooling the cold point tropopause (CPT). We investigate regional CPT temperature anomalies in relation to different modes of natural variability such as the QBO, the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) using multiple linear regression. The warm‐then‐cold evolution of the CPT during November 2015–October 2016 and November 2019–October 2020 can be explained in part by the modulation of convection and Walker circulation by ENSO and the IOD and by the impact of QBO on the stratospheric upwelling as all play major roles in regulating regional CPT. CPT temperatures during the boreal summer following the two disruptions are both colder than almost all summers following WQBO winters; CPT temperatures during summer 2016 are the coldest since 1979, suggesting that any increased frequency of QBO disruptions is likely to impact atmospheric stability near the tropopause."

In this study, the composition of non‐refractory fine particles (NR‐PM2.5) in an urban area in winter Chongqing was characterized by time‐of‐flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF‐ACSM). Organic aerosol (OA), accounting for 48.8% ± 14.6% of NR‐PM2.5, was the most abundant species. Positive matrix factorization model resolved more‐oxidized oxygenated OA (MO‐OOA) as the predominant component of OA (55.8% ± 11.1%), followed by less‐oxidized oxygenated OA (LO‐OOA) (19.0% ± 6.7%). LO‐OOA exhibited dual sensitivity to both aqueous‐phase processing (enhanced at higher Ox levels) and photochemical oxidation, whereas MO‐OOA was predominantly photochemically derived. Moreover, photochemical oxidation preferentially promoted MO‐OOA formation over LO‐OOA. OA exerted a key role in forming the first haze event, which was significantly related to the enhanced production of secondary OA (SOA). Compared to the second event, the first haze exhibited significantly stronger biomass‐burning emissions, likely promoting LO‐OOA formation and its subsequent oxidation to MO‐OOA. Moreover, biomass‐burning may substantially contribute to highly oxidized OA after haze. Generally, the results of this study provide new insights into SOA formation and emphasized the need of controlling biomass burning."

In this study, we reconstruct annual glacier‐wide mass balance from 2000 to 2020 for glaciers larger than 0.1 km2 across the Tien Shan and Pamir using machine learning (ML) techniques. Five ensemble ML and a deep neural network models were tested, with XGBoost demonstrating the best performance and thus selected for the reconstruction of the glacier mass balance time series. Predictor variables included meteorological data from the ERA5‐Land data set and topographic features. The results indicate an average mass loss of −0.39 m water equivalent (m w.e.) per year for the studied period, with the highest losses observed in the Djungar Alatau (−0.68 m w.e. yr−1), and the lowest in the eastern Pamir (−0.10 m w.e. yr−1). Additionally, the results reveal that small glaciers (area <1 km2) experience more rapid mass loss. The temporal evolution of glacier mass balance exhibits, on average, an acceleration but with spatiotemporal variability. Variable importance analysis identified glacier elevation and geographic location as the dominant factors influencing mass balance, followed by the temperatures of July and August.

 Green roofs constitute a critical component in enhancing urban sustainability and resilience, making the systematic assessment of roof greening initiatives a pivotal focus in urban research and planning. A thorough understanding of implementation priorities and potential benefits is essential for effectively promoting green roof adoption. As a multifaceted urban intervention, roof greening involves complex stakeholder coordination and requires comprehensive assessments across various urban development dimensions. Nevertheless, significant research gaps remain regarding the multi-criteria evaluation of building-level roof greening priorities and their associated benefits at urban scales. Here, using geospatial big data, we conduct an urban-scale assessment of roof greening at a single building level in Hong Kong from a sustainable development perspective. We identify that 85.3 % of buildings reveal potential and urgent demand for roof greening (average priority>0.6). We further find green roofs could increase greenspace coverage rate around buildings by 65.7 %, produce hundreds of millions (HK$) in economic benefits annually, and contribute to approximately 0.15 °C urban temperature reduction and 0.8 % annual carbon emission offsets.

 Anthropogenic methane (CH4) sources have had a considerable impact on the Earth’s changing radiation budget since pre-industrial times. Localized sources such as those resulting from the fossil fuel industry and waste treatment have been shown to make up a substantial fraction of the emission total, and CH4 plumes from such sources are detectable through airborne and space-based hyperspectral imaging techniques. Here, we further develop a machine learning technique to estimate CH4 emission rates from such plume images without the need for auxiliary data such as local wind speed information. We directly build upon the idea of previous research which used a convolutional neural network (CNN) called MethaNet and a library of large-eddy-simulations (LES) of turbulent CH4 plumes as our synthetic data environment. Here we suggest appropriate error metrics and changes to the training procedure that reduce systematic biases present in previous studies. Our improved setup has a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10% for sources with flux rates above 40 kg h−1, a Pearson correlation coefficient of 98% and is capable of providing meaningful error estimates for its predictions. This is a significant improvement to MethaNet and other studies and can be used as an efficient method for point source quantification in the future."

 Forest voids—three-dimensional (3D), unoccupied spaces within forest ecosystems—form a critical yet under-described component of stand structure. Shaped by vegetation, microclimate, and disturbance regimes, these voids govern light penetration, airflow, and habitat connectivity. We propose a LiDAR-based framework that identifies, visualizes, and quantifies forest voids directly from terrestrial and mobile laser-scanning (TLS/MLS) point clouds. By treating voids as the 3D regions between the digital elevation model (DEM) or digital surface model (DSM) where no returns are detected, our method bypasses canopy-centric metrics and simplified radiative assumptions, yielding a scalable, assumption-light representation of forest architecture. Across sites, void configurations reflect underlying stand architecture. Forests with high structural heterogeneity—multi-layered canopies and irregular stem distributions—exhibit diffuse, vertically extensive voids. In contrast, structurally uniform stands contain more confined voids, largely restricted to lower strata because of diminished understory development. These patterns demonstrate that forest voids integrate overstory and understory attributes, providing a structural lens on spatial openness under diverse conditions. Although challenges in scalability and independent validation remain, extending this framework to multi-platform LiDAR will enable broader applications in biodiversity monitoring, habitat suitability, and climate-adaptation research. By formalizing forest-void quantification, our study advances structural complexity assessment and offers fresh insights into ecosystem dynamics and function."

 Desertification represents a critical threat to ecosystems, agriculture, and livelihoods in arid and semi-arid regions. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the spatio-temporal evolution of desertification across Algeria’s steppic and northern Sahara regions from 2002 to 2022. Using Earth observation data and cloud-based processing platforms, we developed an analytical workflow1 that combines multitemporal vegetation sparsity mapping and desertification trend analysis. Our approach employed a derived composite index, the Vegetation Sparsity Index (VSI), along with intensity analysis, gravity center change, and regionalization-based clustering. The results showed that desertification dynamics in the study area are not uniform, but characterized by distinct phases of degradation and revegetation. Specifically, desertified areas expanded northward in the western and central regions from 2010, with the central western region, which is vital for agriculture and pastoralism, degraded beyond what rainfall trends alone would predict.

 Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) has been widely applied in shallow-water mapping using multispectral sensors such as Sentinel-2, Landsat-8/9, and HY-1D. However, limitations in revisit frequency, spatial resolution, and spectral coverage constrain their performance in dynamic and optically complex coastal environments. HY-1E, the new-generation ocean color satellite following HY-1D, offers improved spatial resolution, an expanded spectral range, and a reduced revisit time. These improvements are expected to advance remote sensing applications in SDB. Prior to its operational application, a systematic assessment of HY-1E’s bathymetric retrieval capability is essential. In this study, we evaluate the performance of HY-1E imagery for SDB using an ICESat-2-assisted approach across multiple study areas, acquisition times, and image types.

On average, HY-1E outperformed HY-1D by 0.13 m, Sentinel-2 10 m by 0.09 m, and Sentinel-2 20 m by 0.01 m in terms of RMSE. In waters shallower than 10 m, most HY-1E-derived bathymetric models met the ZOC C standard. In terms of terrain characterization, HY-1E demonstrated significant improvements in detail resolution over HY-1D and produced DBMs with lower noise levels compared to Sentinel-2. In addition, this study proposes a data source selection strategy tailored to different types of coastal and reef environments, considering factors such as spectral bands, spatial resolution, revisit cycle, and swath coverage, in order to optimize the balance between inversion efficiency and accuracy."

 Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is a critical measure of ecosystem vitality. This paper examines the spatiotemporal variation in NPP across Africa during 1981–2018 using Theil-Sen slope estimation and wavelet analysis. Sustainable change characteristics in different regions are analyzed using the Hurst exponent, and the influence of driving factors on African NPP are quantified through a structural equation model (SEM). The analysis revealed that: (1) The annual variation curve of African NPP demonstrated a fluctuating upward trajectory (p = 0.001) throughout the study period. Wavelet analysis revealed a cyclical pattern with a primary period of about 20 years, characterized by two upward and downward transitions during 1981–2018. (2) Spatial analysis indicates the distribution of NPP across Africa is centered around the equator and gradually decreases towards higher latitudes, in which the NPP of tropical rainforest and its adjacent areas increases significantly, covering 40.2 % of Africa’s area. However, Hurst exponent analysis reveals that NPP in Africa generally exhibits anti-sustainability changes, with 52.8 % of the total area potentially shifting from growth to decline in the future. (3) SEM analysis shows that NPP in Africa is mainly regulated by natural factors, particularly cumulative precipitation and temperature extremes, which exhibit the highest impact coefficient of 0.89. While topographic factors also have a substantial overall effect, their impact is primarily indirect through climate, with minimal direct influence. These findings offer a scientific foundation and policy support for sustainable development of environmental and socio-economic systems in Africa."

 Aerosols from human activities significantly affect the radiative balance and energy equilibrium of the atmosphere, thereby influencing air pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors. This study examines the Chinese mainland and its surrounding regions in 2014, revealing that aerosols influence meteorological factors and therefore the pollutant concentrations, especially in areas experiencing severe particulate pollution. The aerosol feedback not only increases the annual average concentration of pollutants such as PM2.5 (0.30 μg m−3) and CO (4.04 ppbV), but also reduces the annual average values of meteorological variables such as surface temperature (0.18 K) and wind speed (0.01 m s−1). The magnitude of aerosol feedback on pollutants and meteorological factors depends primarily on the mass concentration of aerosols. During the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Beijing emission reduction period, the impact of aerosol feedback on pollutants and meteorology was clearly weakened in the key emission reduction areas, reflecting the influence of aerosol feedback. Importantly, the feedback effects of aerosols in heavily polluted areas is up to an order of magnitude greater than in the broader study region, although with large spatial variability. In the heavily polluted areas like Beijing, PM2.5 concentrations correlate well with the difference of temperature and wind speed between Beijing and its surrounding areas. It is also shown that, in case of heavy pollution, WRF-Chem model predictive capabilities often diminish, presenting underestimation and shortcomings in assessing the impact of aerosols on heavy pollution and regional disparities. This implies that some feedback processes involving anthropogenic aerosols may not be fully represented in the model. In the face of increasingly severe climate change, better understanding of the bidirectional interactions between aerosols and meteorology, along with associated feedback mechanisms, is essential for effectively mitigating air pollution, adapting to climate change, and managing climate impacts. This study highlights the critical role of aerosol feedback in regional pollution and modulating meteorological factors, providing a scientific basis for targeted air quality management and climate mitigation strategies in heavily polluted areas."

 The limited availability of observational and reanalysis data presents a significant challenge in training machine learning (ML) models for seasonal climate forecasting. Here, we show that training ML-based seasonal forecasting models with a larger number of individual simulations from CMIP6 models enhances their generalization ability and improves precipitation forecasts over South America. Using TelNet, a sequence-to-sequence machine learning model, we assess the performance of models trained with different numbers of CMIP6 simulations compared to those trained with ERA5 reanalysis and the CMIP6 ensemble mean. The results reveal that models trained with only a few CMIP6 simulations perform worse than those trained with ERA5, primarily due to instability during ML model tuning and reduced generalization ability. However, as the number of CMIP6 models increases, performance improves and surpasses both ERA5- and ensemble-mean-based ML models. Reliability and sharpness diagrams analysis further demonstrate that ML models trained with more CMIP6 simulations yield more confident and calibrated forecasts. Moreover, CMIP6-based TelNet constantly outperformed state-of-the-art dynamical models across different initialization months and lead times. This study underscores the potential of leveraging large multi-model dynamical simulations for robust ML-based seasonal climate forecasting."

 Biomass burning is an important source of tropospheric ozone (O3). This study explored the impacts of Indochina springtime (March–April) biomass burnings on the variability and trend of tropospheric O3 in coastal South China using long-term (2000–2024) ozonesondes in Hong Kong and satellite fire retrievals in the Indochina Peninsula (ICP), complemented with EAC4 reanalysis data. We find that the lower-free-tropospheric O3 (LFTO3) concentrations in Hong Kong are significantly correlated with the Indochina biomass burnings, particularly with the two-day-ago biomass burnings in northern Laos (r = 0.57, p < 0.01). While Indochina biomass burning contributes more than 30 ppbv enhancements in LFTO3 concentrations over coastal South China, their impacts on surface O3 concentrations are insignificant. During the study period, there is a significant increasing trend in springtime LFTO3 concentrations in Hong Kong (0.37 ppbv/year), despite decreasing quantity and intension of Indochina biomass burnings. This long-term LFTO3 increasing trend is mainly driven by the eastward migration of Indochina biomass burnings (mainly due to the increase in biomass burnings in the central ICP region), which reduces transport distance to Hong Kong by ∼300 km and thereby improves the transport efficiency, ultimately contributing ∼90 % of the long-term LFTO3 increase in Hong Kong. These findings advance understanding of Indochina biomass burning transport impacts on multi-scale tropospheric O3 variability in coastal South China."
