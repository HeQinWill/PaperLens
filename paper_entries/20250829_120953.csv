This study examines the impacts of climate change attributed flooding on federal disaster aid disbursement in Harris County, Texas following Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Our approach uses flood models to estimate the amount of flood damages attributable and not attributable to climate change under two climate change attribution scenarios from peer reviewed studies: 20% and 38% increases in rainfall associated with the hurricane due to climate change. These estimates are combined with census tract-level disbursement data for FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Individual Assistance (IA) part of the Individuals and Households Program. We employ spatial lag regression models with direct and spatial spillover effects to analyze the relationship between a tract’s flood damages—both attributed and not attributed to climate change—and federal disaster aid. We find that both types of flood damage shape federal aid disbursements, but that climate change attributed damages tend to have larger effect sizes (elasticities) especially for IA. Specifically, for a 1% increase in additional climate change attributed damages per household in a census tract (under the 20% scenario), expected NFIP levels in that census tract are 0.26% higher and IA levels are 0.3% higher. Implications center on federal funding in an era of climate change."

The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in these projections shows transitions to extremely weak overturning below the surface mixed layer (<6 Sv; 1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1) in all models forced by a high-emission (SSP585) scenario and sometimes also forced by an intermediate- (SSP245) and low-emission (SSP126) scenario. These extremely weak overturning states are characterised by a shallow maximum overturning at depths less than 200 m and a shutdown of the circulation associated with North Atlantic deep water formation. Northward Atlantic heat transport at 26°N decreases to 20%–40% of the current observed value. Heat release to the atmosphere north of 45°N weakens to less than 20% of its present-day value and in some models completely vanishes, leading to strong cooling in the subpolar North Atlantic and Northwest Europe. In all cases, these transitions to a weak and shallow AMOC are preceded by a mid-21st century collapse of maximum mixed-layer depth in Labrador, Irminger and Nordic Seas. The convection collapse is mainly caused by surface freshening from a decrease in northward salt advection due to the weakening AMOC but is likely initiated by surface warming. Maximum mixed-layer depths in the observations are still dominated by internal variability but notably feature downward trends over the last 5–10 years in all deep mixing regions for all data products analysed. This could be merely variability but is also consistent with the model-predicted decline of deep mixing."

Freshwater ecosystems are vital for biodiversity, water security, and economic systems, but often lose protection during droughts. Spain, largely under a Mediterranean climate, shows strong interdependence between ecological and socioeconomic systems, with agriculture, tourism, and energy sectors heavily reliant on scarce water resources. Spain’s economy has thrived on water-dependent activities yet increasing droughts and infrastructure limits are pushing ecosystems toward collapse, with severe biodiversity loss and irreversible damage. Furthermore, investments aimed at increasing water-use efficiency often backfire, leading to expanded irrigation without real water savings. Climate change, urbanization, and pollution exacerbate these tensions, posing risks to public health and economic stability. Transformative strategies are urgently needed: protecting and restoring ecosystems, promoting conservation agriculture, regulating water-intensive industries, and planning collective responses to illegal water use. Simply increasing supply or reacting to crises without systemic change of water demands will not ensure future water security. Spain’s experience highlights the urgent need for integrated management of natural and human systems to preserve freshwater resources, biodiversity, and economic resilience."

Our study shows the key source sectors that influence the concentrations and their respective importance. Furthermore, meteorological factors such as wind direction are discussed. This research highlights the challenges in accurately simulating these kinds of measurements and helps us to better understand CH4 variability in the region. 
 This study is the first of two companion papers which investigate the temporal variability of CO2, CH4 and additionally CO concentrations measured at the Xianghe observation site near Beijing in China using the Weather Research and Forecast model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), aiming to understand the contributions from different emission sectors and the influence of meteorological processes. Simulations of the in situ (Picarro) and remote sensing (TCCON-affiliated) measurements are produced by the model's greenhouse gas option, called WRF-GHG, from September 2018 until September 2019. The present study discusses the results for CH4. The model shows good performance, after correcting for biases in boundary conditions, achieving correlation coefficients up to 0.66 for near-surface concentrations and 0.65 for column-averaged data. The simulations use separate tracers for different source sectors and revealed that energy, residential heating, waste management and agriculture are the primary contributors to the CH4 concentrations, with the energy sector having a greater impact on column measurements than surface concentrations. Monthly variability is linked to both emission patterns and meteorological influences, with advection of either clean or polluted air masses from the North China Plain playing a significant role. The diurnal variation of the in situ concentrations due to planetary boundary layer dynamics is quite well captured by WRF-GHG. Despite capturing the key variability of the CH4 observations, the model displays a seasonal bias, likely originating from an incorrect seasonality in the emissions from agricultural and/or waste management activities. Our findings highlight the value of WRF-GHG to interpret both surface and column observations in Xianghe, offering source sector attribution and insights into the link with local and large-scale winds based on the simultaneously computed meteorological fields. However, they also highlight the need to improve the knowledge on the seasonal CH4 cycle in northern China to obtain more accurate emission data and boundary conditions for high-resolution modeling."

We found that fire-related particles not only absorb sunlight and warm the atmosphere, but also scatter light, which cools it. At our remote Amazonia site, most particles had different chemical makeups than direct fire emissions and were the main drivers of how much sunlight was blocked or redirected. 
 During the dry season, the Amazonian atmosphere is strongly impacted by fires, even in remote areas. However, there are still knowledge gaps regarding how each aerosol type affects the aerosol radiative forcing. This work characterizes the chemical composition of submicrometer aerosols and source apportionment of organic aerosols (OAs) and equivalent black carbon (eBC) to study their influence on light scattering and absorption at a remote site in central Amazonia during the dry season (August–December 2013). We applied positive matrix factorization (PMF) and multilinear regression (MLR) models to estimate chemical-dependent mass scattering efficiency (MSE) and extinction efficiency (MEE). Mean PM1 aerosol mass loading was 6.3 ± 3.3 µg m−3, with 77 % of organics, grouped into 3 factors: biomass burning OA (BBOA), isoprene-epoxydiol-derived secondary OA (IEPOX-SOA) and oxygenated OA (OOA). The bulk scattering and absorption coefficients at 637 nm were 17 ± 10 and 3 ± 2 Mm−1, yielding a single scattering albedo of 0.87 ± 0.03. Although eBC represented only 6 % of the PM1 mass loading, MSE was highest for the eBC (13.58–7.62 m2 g−1 at 450–700 nm), followed by BBOA (7.96–3.10 m2 g−1) and ammonium sulfate (AS, 4.79–4.58 m2 g−1). The MEE was dominated by eBC (30.8 %), followed by OOA (19.9 %) and AS (17.6 %). The dominance of eBC over light scattering, in addition to absorption, plays a remarkably important role for this important climate agent, with potentially broad implications for more precise radiative forcing quantification, increasing climate modeling precision and representing deep contributions to Earth's climate system comprehension."

Water vapor isotope structure variations occur on the scale of hundreds of meters, underlining the utility of stable isotopes for studying microscale atmospheric dynamics. This study also provides the basis for better validation of water vapor isotope remote sensing retrievals with surface observations. 
 The isotopic composition of water vapor can be used to track atmospheric hydrological processes and to evaluate numerical models simulating the water cycle. Accurate model–observation comparisons require understanding the spatial and temporal variability of tropospheric water vapor isotopes. The challenging task of obtaining highly resolved water vapor isotopic observations is typically addressed through airborne measurements performed aboard conventional aircraft, but these offer limited microscale insights. This study uses ultralight aircraft observations to investigate water vapor isotopic composition in the lower troposphere over southern France in late summer 2021. Combining observations with models, we identify key drivers of isotopic variability and detect short-lived, small-scale processes. The key findings of this study are that (i) at hourly and sub-daily scales, vertical mixing is the primary driver of isotopic variability in the lowermost troposphere above the study site; (ii) evapotranspiration significantly impacts the boundary layer water vapor isotopic signature, as revealed by the δ18O–δD relationship; and (iii) while water vapor isotopes generally follow large-scale humidity patterns, with separation distances that might range up to 100–300 km, they also reveal distinct small-scale structures (approximately hundreds of meters) that are not fully explained by humidity variations alone, highlighting sensitivity of water vapor isotopic composition to additional fine-scale processes. The latter are particularly evident for δD, which also exhibit the largest differences in horizontal and vertical gradients. Combined with other airborne datasets, our results support a simple model driven by surface observations to simulate tropospheric δD vertical profiles, improving surface–satellite comparisons."

This study simulated the changing spatiotemporal patterns of the impacts of ship emissions on PM2.5 from 2017 to 2021 based on the updated emission inventories and mapping of chemical species in the CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality). Fuel policies caused evident relative changes in inorganic and organic components of the shipping-related PM2.5 over China’s port cities. The driving factors of the interannual, seasonal, and diurnal patterns were discussed. 
 The issue of air pollution caused by ship emissions is becoming prominent with the increasing global shipping activities. China has carried out fuel oil policies in three stages in the past few years to meet the requirements of the global low sulfur regulation by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). However, the impacts of staged policies on air quality in China are not sufficiently understood. This study firstly updated the ship emission inventory including PM2.5 components based on field and on-board measurements under the staged fuel oil policies. Then, the impacts of ship emissions on PM2.5 and its gas precursors and primary and secondary components in China from 2017 to 2021 were revealed by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. In the model domain, the 99th percentile of the shipping-related PM2.5 concentrations was reduced by 19.5 % and then by 35.6 % due to the policy shifts. Ship emissions increased the PM2.5 concentrations up to 3.8 µg m−3 in 2017 and 2.6 µg m−3 in 2021. The areas with high concentration levels widely distributed over offshore waters in 2017 and shrunk to some parts of China's coast in 2021. The contributions of ship emissions to the PM2.5 concentrations over China's main port cities ranged from 3.0 % to 17.4 % in 2017 and 2.5 % to 10.3 % in 2021. In these cities, the change rates of the concentrations of PM2.5, SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, carbonaceous aerosols, V, and Ni related to ship emissions from 2017 to 2021 were −32.7 %, −74.0 %, +11.0 %, −27.5 %, −76.9 %, −90.3 %, and −38.4 %, respectively. NO3- constituted 54.6 % of the shipping-related PM2.5 in 2021. Our findings suggest that it is important to consider both transport pathways and secondary aerosol formation mechanisms to combat the PM2.5 pollution caused by shipping in different regions."

The retrieved Dp/Dc contains error due to the non-sphericity of BC and coatings with various refractive indices. We reveal the remarkable effects of coatings on the Dp/Dc retrieval accuracy of SP2 based on optical simulation of fractal BC aerosols, and further evaluate the simple radiative forcing efficiency of coated BC. 
 The mixing states of coated black carbon particles (BC) are essential for assessing their optical properties and radiative effects. The single particle soot photometer (SP2) measures BC mixing states based on the assumption that the refractive index (RI) of the coating material is constant 1.50 + 0i. However, atmospheric BC aerosols may be coated by diverse materials with various refractive indices, therefore, the unrealistic assumption of coating RI would bring errors in the measured mixing states. For the evaluation of the effects of coating materials on the measurement accuracy of BC mixing states, from the perspective of numerical simulation, typical materials: sulfate, non-absorbing organic carbon (OC), and brown carbon (BrC) are selected as coatings of BC in this study. The fractal closed-cell model and coated-aggregate model are constructed to represent BC with thin and thick coatings, multiple sphere T-matrix (MSTM) simulation results are used to study the optical properties of realistic coated BC, and the mixing states are optically retrieved based on Mie theory according to the retrieval principle of the SP2. Results showed that the SP2 would underestimate mixing states for fractal BC with BC core diameters larger than about 200 nm, and the relative errors of retrieved mixing states for BC coated by sulfate and OC are evidently larger than those for BC coated by BrC. Furthermore, when the SP2 measured mixing states are employed to estimate the absorption enhancement (Eab) and radiative forcing of BC aerosols, the estimation error of Eab for BC with BrC coating is significantly larger than that with sulfate and OC coatings, and the estimation Eab could be up to 6.19 times higher than the inherent value of fractal BC. Compared with fractal BC, the radiative forcing estimation error at 1064 nm for BrC-coated BC can reach −88.73 %, while the estimation errors of BC coated by the other two materials range from −65.22 % to −37.50 %. This study highlights that the coating materials and fractal morphology should be considered when the SP2 is used to measure the mixing state of BC."

Sensors were calibrated using data from reference instruments, and regression and machine learning models were evaluated, identifying opportunities and limitations in model transferability in both indoor and outdoor environments and showcasing the importance of integrating metadata such as activity logs and diffusive tubes to improve data validation and interpretation during deployment in the houses of the participants. 
 Over the past few decades, the study and the use of air quality sensors have significantly increased, leading to a wealth of experience and a deeper understanding of their strengths and limitations. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a methodology for PM2.5 and NO2 sensors to enhance sensor accuracy to a level suitable for epidemiological studies, where ensuring data quality is paramount. The performance evaluation of indoor and outdoor sensors was carried out during the co-location phase with reference-equivalent instruments (RIs), by calculating the relative expanded uncertainties (REUs) stated in the EU Air Quality Directive 2008/50/EC and the recently published EU Directive 2024/2881, target diagrams and common error metrics, before the deployment of the air quality sensor systems (AQSSs) in the houses of patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, in Stuttgart (Germany). Regression and machine learning (ML) models for sensor calibration were tested during the co-location. Moreover, an original methodology was designed and evaluated to validate the sensor data during the deployment in the houses of the participants. The study found that indoor sensor calibration using artificially generated NO2 and aerosols does not ensure model transferability, emphasizing the need for training data that matches the intended deployment environment in terms of real patterns of concentration, particle composition and environmental conditions. Moreover, the effect of the aggregation time (1, 5, 10, and 15 min) on the performance of the calibration models was evaluated for NO2 sensors. Integrating metadata such as activity logs, window status, and data from official monitoring stations, as well as NO2 measurements with diffusion tubes, proved to be helpful for data validation and interpretation during the sensor deployment in the houses of the participants."

By using advanced modelling techniques and incorporating sea surface temperature observations, it provides a consistent picture of long-term climate variability. The dataset captures key ocean, sea ice, and atmosphere changes, helping scientists understand past climate changes and variability. 
 Climate reanalyses are essential for studying climate variability, understanding climate processes, and initializing climate predictions. We present CoRea1860+ (Wang and Counillon, 2025, https://doi.org/10.11582/2025.00009), a 30-member coupled reanalysis spanning from 1860 to the present, produced using the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model (NorCPM) and assimilating sea surface temperature (SST) observations. NorCPM combines the Norwegian Earth System Model with the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation method. SST, available throughout the entire period, serves as the primary source of instrumental oceanic measurements prior to the 1950s. CoRea1860+ belongs to the category of sparse-input reanalyses, designed to minimize artefacts arising from changes in the observation network over time. By exclusively assimilating oceanic data, this reanalysis offers valuable insights into the ocean's role in driving climate system variability, including its influence on the atmosphere and sea ice. This study first describes the numerical model, the SST dataset, and the assimilation implementation used to produce CoRea1860+. It then provides a comprehensive evaluation of the reanalysis across four key aspects, namely reliability, ocean variability, sea ice variability, and atmospheric variability, benchmarked against more than 10 independent reanalyses and observational datasets. Overall, CoRea1860+ demonstrates strong reliability, particularly in observation-rich periods, and provides a reasonable representation of climate variability. It successfully captures key features such as multi-decadal variability and long-term trends in ocean heat content, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and sea ice variability in both hemispheres. Furthermore, to some extent, CoRea1860+ agrees with the reference atmospheric datasets for surface air temperature, precipitation, sea level pressure, and 500 hPa geopotential height, especially in the tropics where air–sea interactions are most pronounced."

The data were harmonized to create a consistent dataset which includes gap-filled time series of meteorological and lower-cost eddy covariance measurements with identical instrumentation, accounting for a total of seventy eight site-years of data. The objective of this dataset is to provide observational data on the differences of meteorological conditions, carbon, water and energy balances of adjacent agroforestry and open cropland or grassland sites in five distinct climatic regions of Germany. This extensive, continuous dataset can be used to study ecosystem properties and the potential benefits of agroforestry. It can also be used to parametrize models on crop and biomass productivity, or to evaluate the response of such agroecosystems to climate change scenarios, among other applications.

Pyrrole reacted with a rate constant of (1.18 ± 0.3) × 103 M–1 s–1 and formed 7 to 45% FAC depending on the ClO2 to pyrrole ratios. The imidazole reaction was pH-dependent since its anionic species (pKa = 14.4) rate constant was (2.08 ± 1.4) × 106 M–1 s–1. However, the reaction at pH 7 is relatively slow (6.7 × 10–2 M–1 s–1). Imidazole also showed 37% FAC formation. Nucleobases, adenine, guanine, as well as the pharmaceutical dexmedetomidine, have imidazole moieties and show a very similar reaction rate constant, FAC yield, and ClO2 consumption in their reaction with ClO2, pointing out the relevance of aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycles in ClO2 application."

Using a dynamic stock model, we measure the cumulative demands (2023–2060) for 17 metals across the entire hydrogen industrial chain under five scenarios. Results show that although the shift to green hydrogen reduces the demands for cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg), it significantly increases the demands for lanthanum (La), lithium (Li), platinum group metals (PGMs), and titanium (Ti). In the baseline scenario, 87.4% of metals are sourced from primary resources, but the application of the circular economy could reduce such demands by 20–77%. Notably, even with aggressive recycling, there will be potential PGM supply shortages, indicating that it is urgent to obtain such supply through international cooperation.

However, poor N2 selectivity severely restricts their large-scale practical applications. In this study, we achieved an improvement in both activity and selectivity of Mn-based SCR catalysts by W modification and revealed the mechanism by which the formation of Mn–W dinuclear active sites enhances their performance. By combining experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the improved NH3-SCR performance of the MnW/TiO2 catalyst was attributed to the significant redox role of W, resulting from the formation of strongly interacting Mn–W dinuclear sites. The entire NH3-SCR reaction pathway over the Mn–W dinuclear site was elucidated at the atomic level, confirming that the W sites played a redox role in the reaction, specifically by directly participating in the oxidative activation of NH3.

Here, we demonstrate that the air–water interface in microdroplets can be strategically utilized to dramatically enhance PFOA (C0 = 20 mg L–1) degradation through a simple Fe(III)-Oxalate photochemical system, achieving complete destruction with 99% defluorination within 4 h at room temperature - a rate 2 orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Through comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations, we reveal that this remarkable enhancement stems from three synergistic interfacial effects: concentrated generation of superoxide radicals (O2·–) from earth-abundant Fe(III)-Oxalate complexes, significantly enhanced O2·- nucleophilicity due to disrupted solvation shells, and a strong interfacial electric field that catalyzes C–F bond activation. These molecular-level insights into interfacial chemistry not only provide an efficient and economical strategy for PFOA remediation but also establish a new paradigm for enhancing nucleophilic reactions in aqueous systems.

Herein, a zwitterionic polymeric membrane (ZPM) was fabricated via a two-step protocol. During surface water filtration, ZPM demonstrated high pure water permeance (about 1433 L·m–2·h–1·bar–1) and superior fouling-resistant ability compared with the commercial ultrafiltration membrane. The enhanced fouling control was attributed to the greater hydrophilicity and narrower pore size of ZPM. Molecular dynamics simulations and XDLVO analysis revealed that the reduced values of van der Waals energy during the interaction between foulants and ZPM were the main mechanism. Furthermore, the zwitterionic polymer underwent deformation under a NaCl solution (10 g·L–1) due to the antielectrolyte effect, causing ZPM to mechanical swelling. This mechanical effect alone can remove 70% of the membrane fouling resistance, comparable to the performance of pure water backwashing. The swelling of ZPM also reduced the membrane pore size, leading to a 56% increase in flux velocity, further removing membrane fouling resistance. This study provides new insights into enhanced membrane fouling control across the entire filtration cycle by implementing a dual strategy that combines high-efficiency membrane material with a cost-effective operational process."

Previous work has suggested PFAS can accumulate at higher concentrations in sea foam than the bulk water. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was employed to identify and quantify PFAS, with strict quality control measures applied to confirm results. Quantitative analysis detected up to 42 PFAS compounds, with particularly high concentrations in condensed sea foam samples, highlighting their role in accumulating PFAS. In one foam sample, PFOS, was observed at ca. 8,000,000 ng/L (ppt) whereas, PFO5DoA, a compound predominantly found in North Carolina, was detected at levels exceeding 20,000 ng/L in some samples.

Although biological activity is considered the primary driver of OP dephosphorylation, the abiotic mechanism under redox oscillations remains unexplained. Here, we show that hydrological perturbation-driven redox fluctuations can mediate abiotic phosphate release from OP. Through laboratory simulations and analyses of natural riparian sediments, we demonstrate that the dark production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for this process. Hydroxyl radical (•OH)-mediated oxidation emerges as the dominant dephosphorylation pathway, with superoxide (O2•-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) acting as key intermediates. Redox oscillations enhance the mobilization of sedimentary OP into the dissolved phase, thereby accelerating its ROS-mediated dephosphorylation. Investigations of natural sediments confirm that ROS produced during redox oscillations drive abiotic OP mineralization, with reaction rates controlled by sediment electron-exchange capacity and iron speciation. These results reveal a previously unrecognized abiotic pathway for OP transformation that operates alongside enzymatic hydrolysis, photodegradation, and mineral-catalyzed degradation."

Soil organic carbon accrual dictated carbon removals and GHG emissions intensity. Many enterprises applied N fertilizer at rates higher than recommended best practices, suggesting that reduced fertilizer quantities may sustainably reduce GHG emissions without impacting yields. We conclude that many macadamia farms are net carbon sinks, which contrasts with other agricultural sectors that are often sources of GHGs.

However, aqueous Fe(II), a common form of ferrous iron, can be rapidly oxidized but scarcely contributes to ·OH production. Herein, this study proposes a thermodynamic control strategy by introducing micro-nanobubbles (MNBs) into an aqueous Fe(II)/O2 system to stimulate its potential. Experimental results indicate that MNBs alter the electron transfer pathway from aqueous Fe(II) to O2, shifting the predominant mechanism from a one-electron transfer pathway to a two-electron transfer pathway; this can reduce energy loss and improve the overall electron utilization efficiency. Under optimal conditions, ·OH production and pollutant degradation reached 20 μM and 15%, respectively, compared to almost 0 in the system without MNBs. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that MNBs lower the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) of the system and reduce the Gibbs free energy of key reaction steps, enabling efficient ·OH production. The aqueous Fe(II)/MNBs/O2 system demonstrates a broad applicability for the degradation of various pollutants with removal rates ranging from 25% to 36%, highlighting its potential as a promising approach for green and sustainable groundwater remediation."

The results showed that PE-MPs and PLA-MPs exhibited distinct aging characteristics under identical conditions. Photolysis represents the primary aging mechanism for PE-MPs, and prolonged solar radiation significantly reduces their stability (p < 0.05). Notably, soil minerals (e.g., Illite and quartz) formed armor-like coatings encapsulating PE-MP surfaces through chemical interfacial interactions (C–Si–O, Si–O–C, and Al–O–C)─a novel mechanism enhancing PE stability in soils. However, the stable interfacial adhesion between soil minerals and PLA-MPs is minimal. Microbial degradation as the primary aging mechanism renders PLA-MPs in soil more susceptible to aging compared to those in air, consequently exhibiting lower stability. This study highlights the mineral-mediated aging of MPs in soil and demonstrates how mineral coatings enhance the stability of PE-MPs. This underscores the necessity of incorporating mineral-mediated aging processes into MP risk assessments for soil ecosystems."

However, how ARGs evolve during natural succession in pristine ecosystems remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized metagenomic sequencing to investigate ARG dynamics across a 12,000 year sedimentary chronosequence in an intertidal zone. ARG abundance and diversity showed a significant upward trend with sediment depth, peaking in the deepest, oldest layers, as corroborated by compositional shifts linked to sediment age (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001). This trend reflects the natural evolution of ARGs dominated by stochastic process, as supported by the low detection rates of three human activity-related indicators and the robust fit to the neutral community model (R2 = 0.576). Furthermore, ARG evolution was mainly attributed to alterations in microbial communities, reflected in the growing complexity of ARG-microbe interaction networks and significant procrustes correlations between microbial taxa and ARG profiles. Specially, Proteobacteriota and Actinobacteriota were identified as the key taxa driving ARG evolution, with their succession patterns closely mirroring ARG enrichment trends. Interestingly, the enrichment of MGEs in deeper sediments and their closer association with ARGs during natural succession underscore an enhanced HGT potential, highlighting the pivotal role of MGEs in driving ARG evolution. This study reveals the natural dynamics of ARGs during sedimentary processes, providing an important reference for understanding their independent natural evolution and strengthening our insight into the progression of environmental antibiotic resistance development."

However, the prevalence of these chemicals in PCPs used by the public, particularly by Black women and Latinas, remains poorly documented. We examined the prevalence of formaldehyde and FRPs listed as ingredients on PCPs from the Taking Stock Study (TSS), a community-engaged study in which 70 Black women and Latinas in South Los Angeles logged their PCP use with a smartphone application. We contextualized our results using EPA’s Chemical and Products Database (CPDat), a public ingredient database. More than half of the TSS participants (53%) reported using at least one PCP with formaldehyde or FRPs despite only 4% of TSS PCPs and 8% of CPDat PCPs listing formaldehyde and/or FRPs as ingredients. We found formaldehyde and FRPs listed in frequently used products such as lotions and cleansers. The most common FRP was 1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMDM) hydantoin. These results could inform the types of regulations needed to protect the U.S. population from adverse health risks due to formaldehyde exposure from PCP use."

We aimed to investigate the individual and joint effects of PM and night-time temperature on sperm quality. This population-based cohort study with 19,318 volunteers and 55,610 semen samples was conducted in Henan, China, from 2013 to 2020. High spatial resolution gridded data sets were used to estimated individual PM (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) and night-time temperature exposures during the entire period (0–90 lag days) and three critical periods (0–9, 10–14, 70–90 lag days) of sperm development. Generalized linear mixed models assessed the individual and joint effects on sperm quality. We found that the per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM1 throughout spermatogenesis was associated with decreased sperm count (β, −0.068; 95% CI: −0.116, −0.021). Increasing PM2.5 per IQR was related to reductions in sperm concentration 0.052 (95% CI: −0.098, −0.005) and sperm count 0.086 (95% CI: −0.134, −0.039). Night-time temperature was negatively related to sperm concentration, sperm count, and sperm motility (all P < 0.05). Combined higher night-time temperatures and PM1 (or PM2.5) concentrations significantly impacted sperm concentration, count, and motility (all Pinteraction < 0.05). Synergistic effects of night-time temperature and PM1 on abnormal progressive motility were observed (relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), 0.27; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.53). Similar joint effects of night-time temperatures and PM2.5 and PM10 on sperm quality were observed. Our results suggested that individual and joint effects of night-time temperature and PM exposure negatively impact sperm quality.

Understanding their human exposure is critical for the risk management of these nanomaterials. Once released into the environment, metal nanomaterials are prone to undergo sulfidation. This process significantly alters the physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials and subsequently, dictates the extents and pathways of exposure. Here, we show that sulfidation of nanosized Ag, ZnO, CuO, and Cu2O affects their macrophage uptake to varied degrees, by differentially regulating protein corona compositions and aggregation states of the nanomaterials. Sulfidation-induced changes in hydrodynamic diameters determine whether macrophage uptake occurs through endocytosis or phagocytosis. For a given uptake pathway, the extents of uptake depend on macrophage recognition of protein corona, the compositions of which are largely influenced by sulfidation. Specifically, increased abundance of transferrin and low-density apolipoprotein C2 in the corona as affected by sulfidation promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while the enrichment of complement factor H facilitates uptake by complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis. The findings advance our understanding on the nanospecific mechanisms governing environmental behaviors and implications of nanomaterials, and further underline the importance of taking into account the aging processes in the risk management of these materials."

However, knowledge about the MC concentrations in plateau lakes experiencing high solar radiation is scarce. This study investigated the spatial-temporal distribution of MCs in eight Yunnan Plateau lakes in China, focusing on their relationships with environmental factors. Water samples (n = 63) were collected during summer and winter seasons and analyzed for MC concentrations along with a suite of environmental variables. Results revealed significant seasonal and spatial variations in MC concentrations, with higher levels in eutrophic lakes Dianchi, Erhai, and Xingyunhu. Notably, mean MC concentrations in Lake Dianchi during summer and Erhai during winter exceeded the World Health Organization’s provisional guideline of 1 μg/L for drinking water. Seasonal analyses revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms: MC concentrations in summer were positively correlated with total phosphorus, total nitrogen, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, reflecting the influence of eutrophication on cyanobacterial growth. While solar radiation intensity (SRI) exhibited a dual role: moderate SRI in winter was associated with higher MC levels, whereas higher SRI in summer suppressed MC production, likely due to photoinhibition or MC degradation. Strikingly, water temperature showed no significant correlation with MC concentrations, suggesting that high solar radiation in the Yunnan Plateau may override temperature-dependent effects on cyanobacterial growth. These findings highlight the importance of nutrient management and the regulatory role of solar radiation in regulating MC production in high-altitude lakes. The study underscores the need for region-specific strategies to mitigate cyanobacterial risks, particularly in drinking water source lakes, by integrating nutrient control and the unique light regime of plateau ecosystems."

After 4 weeks of exposure, zebrafish ovaries exhibited polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-like changes, including polycystic ovaries, reduced spawning rates, and elevated androgen levels. Moreover, ETO was transmitted to offspring via maternal ovaries, significantly increasing larval mortality and deformity rates while reducing their locomotor activity. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling revealed oxidative stress responses, disrupted unsaturated fatty acid and glutathione metabolism, and damage to ovarian granulosa cells and the zona pellucida, as confirmed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluorescence staining. Combined multiomics analysis demonstrated that ETO exposure exacerbated ovarian oxidative stress, impaired the functional structure of ovaries, and disrupted follicular cell maturation via hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway.

Utilizing quantum chemical calculations and computational toxicology simulations, we examined the •OH-mediated atmospheric transformation and toxicological progression of γ-terpinene in the indoor environment. The results indicate that •OH additions are the dominant pathways for the reaction of •OH + γ-terpinene. The most favorable reactive intermediates formed from the •OH-addition reactions subsequently react with O2 to form hydroxy γ-terpinene peroxy radicals (OH-γ-terp-RO2•).

Besides several other indicators, the AAQD and DWD consist of chemical parameters (substances or substance groups) that are regulated within this framework. All the substances are associated with various health outcomes, and many of them are classified as carcinogenic or probably/possibly carcinogenic with causal links. To quantify the health burden of the chemical substances included in the AAQD and DWD, we need information regarding population exposure, current baseline mortality/morbidity rates in the populations, and exposure–response functions (ERFs) or unit risks (URs) from previous epidemiological studies. During this study, we analyzed the availability of ERFs or URs and discussed their applicability in health impact assessments (HIAs). From the HIA perspective, ERFs─in terms of relative risk (RR), standardized mortality ratio (SMR), odds ratio (OR), or UR data─were available for many of the analyzed substances. However, for some substances such as acrylamide, antimony, boron, chlorate and chlorite, copper, microcystin-LR, and selenium, no risk measures could be identified. The aim of this study is to derive ERFs, which will allow HIAs for a larger number of chemicals when exposure data and baseline mortality/morbidity data are available. Currently, HIAs have largely focused only on main ambient pollutants such as particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and ozone (O3). In contrast, health risks related to exposure to chemicals are much more diverse, and the health burdens should be quantified to a much greater extent."

We measured nine OPFR metabolite concentrations in urine samples and assessed depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire. In the fully adjusted linear regression models, a 2.7-fold increase in urinary diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) concentrations was associated with a 0.44 unit (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06, 0.82) higher depressive symptom scores. When men were categorized as having any depressive symptoms (score: > 10 vs ≤ 10), Poisson regression models showed an increased risk of depression across DPHP tertiles (Ptrend = 0.08). Further, we found stronger associations between urinary OPFR metabolite concentrations and depressive symptom scores among men with a higher waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, or waist-height ratio (Pinteraction < 0.15). The machine learning algorithm identified three different patterns of obesity, and the strongest association between urinary DPHP concentrations and depressive symptom scores was observed among men with a waist-hip ratio of ≥ 0.89 and a body mass index of <24 kg/m2. In summary, exposure to OPFRs may be associated with depressive symptoms among young men, especially in those with abdominal obesity."

Here, we utilize data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft to investigate the Martian bow shock, revealing its distinctive characteristics within our solar system. We find that unlike other planetary shocks, the reformation of Mars's bow shock driven by the ultra‐low frequency (ULF) waves is more global and less dependent on shock geometries. This distinct behavior is attributed to the broad distribution of ULF waves in the upstream region at Mars, generated not only by shock‐reflected ions but also by planetary protons. Additionally, during the reformation process, the amplitude of the ULF waves and the steepened structures are significantly large. This results in the newly reformed shock exceeding the original one, a phenomenon not observed at other planets under similar shock conditions. Therefore, the ULF waves significantly enhance the complexity of shock dynamics and play a more substantial role at Mars compared to other planets."

Whereas the equatorward auroral undulation (EAU) has been frequently observed and well known, the poleward auroral undulation (PAU) has never been observed yet. Both EAU and PAU were found in the N2 LBHL (165–180 nm, mostly due to electron precipitation) and Lyman α 121.6 nm (due to proton precipitation) images acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft. The spatial amplitude and wavelength of the PAU reached ∼900 km. During the PAU crossing, DMSP observed both precipitating electrons and ions (protons) and a plasma drift up to ∼5,000 m/s with a strong shear. Simultaneous ground‐based all‐sky imaging at South Pole captured the dynamic behavior of the PAU that propagated in an anti‐sunward direction at a phase speed of ∼250 m/s. The solar wind conditions during the PAU were a high solar wind speed (∼700 km/s), an intense southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF, approximately −40 nT), and a high density (37 cm−3).

A detailed investigation of the equatorial shadow region confirms that the dense plasmasphere blocks AKR emissions across all wave frequencies. Low‐frequency emissions (<100 kHz) are presents outside the shadow region at larger radial distance, which is attributed to magnetosheath reflection, while higher‐frequency emissions (>100 kHz) propagate via plasmaspheric ducting and leakage, filling the equatorial region immediately outside the plasmasphere.

Two damage pathways have been suggested to explain this relationship: that high temperatures directly stress crops and drive yield loss, or that high temperatures induce water stress in crops, which in turn drives yield loss. Here we explore a third pathway: that soil water stress limits both agricultural productivity and evaporative cooling, giving rise to the nonlinear relationship between temperature and yield. Determining which of these pathways underpins the yield‐temperature relationship is important for predicting future crop productivity because climate change is expected to alter the co‐variability between temperature and water availability. To examine this third pathway, we use cumulative growing‐season transpiration from an idealized land surface model as a proxy for yield. This approach reproduces the observed yield‐temperature relationship, even though the model includes no mechanisms that limit productivity at high temperatures. In experiments where the influence of temperature on soil moisture is suppressed, yields still decline during hot, dry periods in a manner consistent with the observations. We conclude that water stress, and its influence on evaporative cooling, temperature, and agricultural productivity, drives the yield‐temperature relationship found in crops that experience episodic water stress. This framework explains the muted sensitivity of irrigated yields to high atmospheric temperatures, and suggests that future yield outcomes depend more critically on changes in rainfall than suggested by estimates that attribute yield losses primarily to temperature variations."

Two distinctive aspects of Typhoon Khanun's ERC are (a) its ERC occurred during a 2‐day period (∼0600 UTC 1 to ∼0600 UTC 3 August) when its motion slowed down being sandwiched between the midlatitude and low‐latitude subtropical highs and (b) after replacing the inner eyewall, the radius of the outer eyewall expands instead of shrinking and the typhoon's intensity quickly decreased. As revealed in microwave imager brightness temperature observations, the phases of wavenumber‐2 disturbances on the outer side of the inner eyewall and the inner side of the outer eyewall during the ERC had opposite signs. After the ERC was completed, the absolute angular momentum decreased at the outer eyewall, causing expansion of the outer eyewall and a decrease in typhoon intensity.

Inspired by divergent outcomes regarding SHiELD's ability to predict two high‐impact ARs, successful week 2 forecasts of landfalling AR activity in SHiELD are found to be dependent, at least in part, on how favorably the large‐scale environment is preconditioned to the development and/or maintenance of AR activity during the preceding week. Our findings suggest SHiELD can skillfully predict AR activity and its related extreme precipitation at leads of 2–3 weeks, providing stakeholders ample time to monitor areas at risk for widespread flooding while also preparing them for potential impacts.

In this study, we quantitatively diagnose these uplift mechanisms by solving the quasi‐geostrophic omega equation in Q‐vector form. To provide a process‐based assessment, Q vectors are decomposed into shearwise (i.e., along‐isentrope) and transverse components (i.e., cross‐isentrope), representing the Lagrangian changes in the direction and magnitude, respectively, of the potential temperature gradient following the geostrophic motion. The composite analysis reveals the upper‐ and lower‐tropospheric synoptic‐scale weather conditions which have been documented as being favorable for springtime MCS initiation. We find that shearwise ascent, induced by a baroclinically organized (i.e., westward tilted with height) trough‐ridge couplet, is the leading contributor to total dynamical ascent. The contribution of an upper‐level jet streak, which induces upward motion in its right‐entrance region through geostrophic frontogenesis, turns out to be secondary, as indicated by weak transverse ascent. The lower‐tropospheric transverse ascent, induced by warm frontogenesis at the exit region of the Great Plains low‐level jet, is also limited in magnitude. Furthermore, MCSs initiated under stronger shearwise ascent grow into larger, more precipitation‐producing storms. This study underscores the critical role of transient baroclinic wave amplification not only in the genesis but also in the subsequent evolution of springtime MCSs in the central United States."

 Subduction of oceanic lithosphere and delamination of continental lithosphere constitute the two predominant mechanisms by which the Earth’s surface is recycled into the mantle. Continental plate delamination typically occurs in collisional orogens by the separation of the lithospheric mantle from the overlying lighter crust, aided by weak layers within continental lithosphere. By contrast, oceanic lithosphere is generally considered to be sufficiently rigid to inhibit delamination. Here we show from seismic imaging and numerical simulations that delamination of oceanic lithosphere is occurring offshore Southwest Iberia. Specifically, seismic tomography reveals a high-velocity anomaly that we interpret as a delaminating block of old oceanic lithosphere, a process that we reproduce with numerical simulations. We propose that this process was triggered by plate convergence and assisted by a thick serpentinized layer that allows the lithospheric mantle to decouple from the overlying crust. We suggest that such oceanic delamination may facilitate subduction initiation, a long-unsolved problem in the theory of plate tectonics, and may be responsible for some of the highest-magnitude earthquakes in Europe, including the M8.5–8.7 Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 and the M7.9 San Vincente Earthquake of 1969.

Here, the authors report a NF-YA transcription factor gene SW14 regulates soybean seed traits without affecting other agronomic traits by inhibiting GmLEC1-mediated transcriptional activation. 
 Seed weight and oil/protein content are critical agronomic traits that determine soybean yield and quality. However, the key genes controlling these traits and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a combination of genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping with seed weight variations, and identified a Nuclear Factor-YA (NF-YA) gene on chromosome 14 that positively regulates seed weight and protein content while negatively regulating oil content without affecting other agronomic traits, designated as Seed Weight 14 (SW14). SW14 physically interacts with GmLEC1a/b, the soybean orthologs of the central regulator of plant seed development, Leafy Cotyledon1 (LEC1), to disrupt the formation of a non-canonical NF-Y complex comprising GmLEC1, GmNF-YC2, and GmbZIP67, thereby inhibiting the GmLEC1-mediated transcriptional activation involved in seed development process. Natural allelic variations in SW14 affect the stability of the SW14 protein, which in turn confers varied seed weight and oil/protein content in soybean. Further analysis demonstrates that the elite SW14H3 allele has undergone artificial selection during domestication and holds potential for improving yield in soybean. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the molecular basis that specifically regulates seed weight and quality, offering a potential strategy for overcoming tradeoff effects and facilitating high-yield breeding in soybean.

 CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) has extensive research and clinical potential. Here, we show that commonly used CRISPRa systems can exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity. We demonstrate the toxicity of CRISPRa vectors expressing the activation domains (ADs) of the transcription factors p65 and HSF1, components of the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) CRISPRa system. Based on our findings for the SAM system, we extended our studies to additional ADs and acetyltransferase core domains. We show that the expression of potent transcriptional activators in lentiviral producer cells can lead to low lentiviral titers, while their expression in the transduced target cells leads to cell death. Using inducible lentiviral vectors, we could not identify an activator expression window for effective SAM-based CRISPRa without measurable toxicity. The toxicity of current SAM-based CRISPRa systems hinders their wide adoption in biomedical research and introduces selection pressures that may confound genetic screens. Our results suggest that the further development of CRISPRa technology should consider both the efficiency of gene activation and activator toxicity.

 Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an ideal chemical feedstock due to its abundance, low cost, low toxicity and its role as a greenhouse gas.

 Non-invasive optical imaging tools for early detecting anti-tumor immune responses are crucial for precision cancer immunotherapy.

In vivo NIR-II ratiometric imaging reveals that GzmB activity well correlates with cytotoxic T cell responses and tumor growth, and can effectively distinguish responders from non-responders in both Hepa 1-6 tumor xenograft models and patient-derived xenograft models.

 Despite recent improvements to electricity access in lower-income countries, reliability remains low for many. Local renewable electricity infrastructure supplementing the national grid offers a promising route to improved reliability for rural communities. However, improvements in the reliability of national grids create risks for investors including the possibility of “stranded” renewable assets.

 Clear elucidation of the connection between chemical structure and biological action mechanisms is the key issue preventing the successful development of nanomedicines. Herein, employing essential trace element selenium (Se) as an example, we fabricate organic-inorganic covalent Se hybrid by anchoring Se atom to polyethylene glycol chain during carbonization to form organic Se-C and inorganic Se-Se bonds in one system to integrate the advantages of both species. The weak covalent Se-Se bond breaks down in response to redox stimuli, thus releases organic Se with stronger electron transfer ability to scavenge free radicals, and forms highly active inorganic Se, which further releases free Se atom to trigger selenoprotein synthesis and activation, ultimately reverses reperfusion injury in male-mice ischemic stroke, and improves neurological restoration. This work provides a unique Se atom reprogramming strategy to design highly bioactive hybrid Se species with clear chemical nature and action mechanisms.

 Methane emissions from the boreal-Arctic region are likely to increase due to warming and permafrost thaw, but the magnitude of increase is unconstrained. Here we show that distinguishing several wetland and lake classes improves our understanding of current and future methane emissions. Our estimate of net annual methane emission (1988–2019) was 34 (95% CI: 25–43) Tg CH4 yr−1, dominated by five wetland (26 Tg CH4 yr−1) and seven lake (5.7 Tg CH4 yr−1) classes. Our estimate was lower than previous estimates due to explicit characterization of low methane-emitting wetland and lake classes, for example, permafrost bogs, bogs, large lakes and glacial lakes. To reduce uncertainty further, improved wetland maps and further measurements of wetland winter emissions and lake ebullition are needed. Methane emissions were estimated to increase by ~31% under a moderate warming scenario (SSP2-4.5 by 2100), driven primarily by warming rather than permafrost thaw.

 Boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) is a key component of tropical climate variability, characterized by eastward and northeastward propagation of organized convection across the Indo-Pacific region. BSISO influences weather and climate extremes through atmospheric teleconnections, but its future changes and related extremes remain unclear. Here, based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we find that under a high-emission scenario, BSISO convection will shift eastward by ~3° (~300 km) in 2065–2099, driven by moisture profile changes associated with sea surface temperature warming over central-to-eastern Pacific. This eastward-shifted BSISO convection, along with a northward expansion of the westerly jet, strengthens the BSISO teleconnections that extend into broader areas of North America. These changes will increase the BSISO-related heatwave risks by 23% and wildfire risks by 3.5 times over northern North America compared to present-day conditions. The findings underscore the amplification of BSISO’s influence on extreme risks of extreme weather, emphasizing the need for improved adaptation and mitigation strategies for future climates."

 Market-based instruments, including competitive tenders, are central to funding global environmental restoration and management projects. Recently, tenders have been utilised to fund Nature-based Solutions schemes for Natural Flood Management, with the explicit purpose of achieving co-benefits; flood management and reducing inequities. While multiple studies consider the efficacy of Nature-based Solutions for tackling inequities, no prior research has quantified whether the resource allocation for these projects has been conducted equitably. We analyse two national natural flood management programmes funded through competitive tenders in England to explore who benefits by considering the characteristics of projects, including socio-economic, geographical (e.g. rurality) and flood risk dynamics.

 Biological carbon removal has been proposed as a ‘win-win’ for climate, sustainability and public opinion, but research on public perceptions is lacking explicit evidence on trade-offs between options. Here we explore perceptions using small group deliberation (n60) plus a nationally representative survey (n2027) in the UK’s four jurisdictions. We find a strong preference for carbon removal to play a substantial role in meeting national climate targets, stemming from persistent scepticism about emissions reductions and behaviour change. However, such support was tempered with caution about whether certain biological techniques - biochar, peatland restoration, and perennial biomass crops - would be “worth it”. In particular, concerns were raised about life-cycle emissions, as well as land competition with urgent housing needs, and scientific uncertainty around novel techniques such as biochar. While we find that responses to carbon removal tend to shift the burden of responsibility for climate action away from individuals, we also identify region-specific discourses, highlighting the importance of local context in shaping public views.

 Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) near the core-mantle boundary (CMB) are key yet enigmatic structures. Their origin is often linked to the accumulation of subducted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB), but computational models question MORB as the sole source due to its predicted high shear wave velocity compared to normal mantle. This uncertainty is compounded by the lack of direct sound velocity measurements at CMB pressures. Here we address this gap through ultrahigh-pressure shear wave velocity measurements on CaCl2- and α-PbO2-type SiO2, major phases in MORB, at pressures exceeding those of the CMB. Our results show shear velocities in dense SiO2 phases are ~ 7–14% lower than previous predictions under these conditions. Incorporating these values into MORB models suggests that the typical seismic anomaly of −1.5% (δlnVS) observed in LLSVPs can be explained by ~ 23–33 vol.% oceanic crust along a cold slab geotherm, without invoking extreme thermal anomalies (+1500 K). Considering a subduction history exceeding 2 billion years, this scenario supports long-term MORB accumulation at the lowermost mantle. These findings provide new constraints on LLSVP composition and offer critical insights into deep mantle dynamics and the evolution of Earth’s interior.

 Plant canopies are integrated units that coordinate their functional (e.g., foliar biochemistry) and structural properties. This coordination affects remote sensing observations of canopy reflectance and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). One key canopy structural property is leaf angle. Despite the fact that radiative transfer models have shown the crucial role of leaf angle in modulating remote sensing signals, methodological and technological barriers have prevented detailed investigations of how leaf angle covaries with canopy function and remote sensing observations. In this study, we employ a novel uncrewed aerial system (UAS) called FluoSpecAir to study the spatial patterns in far-red (FR) SIF (SIFobs,FR), near-infrared reflectance and radiance of vegetation (NIRV and NIRVR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and chlorophyll:carotenoid index (CCI), across individual tree canopies during two separate time periods. Additionally, we collected 3D scans of individual tree canopies using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and estimated foliar pigment content from leaf reflectance spectra. We used the 3D scans to calculate the leaf angle distribution (LAD) and leaf area voxel density (LAVD) of each canopy. We modeled LAD using a beta distribution, which is parameterized by μ and ν, and the leaf inclination distribution function (LIDF), which is parameterized by LIDFa and LIDFb. We found that ν and μ, which are inversely related to the variance in leaf angle, covaried with spatial patterns in peak growing season canopy CCI, NDVI, SIFobs,FR, and SIFobs,FRNIRVR, and leaf chlorophyll content. Canopies with greater variation in LAD, thus lower ν and μ, have larger values of NDVI, CCI, SIFobs,FR, SIFobs,FRNIRVR, and leaf chlorophyll content, while LAVD is not correlated with these remote sensing metrics. We found positive correlations between leaf chlorophyll content and canopy NDVI, SIFobs,FR, and SIFobs,FRNIRVR, as well. Together, our results show that across our study site during the peak growing season, spatial variability in remote sensing variables is driven by the coordination between LAD and leaf chlorophyll content. These findings provide important context for how we interpret landscape level variability in SIF and SIFobs,FRNIRVR, and how spatial variation in both can be used to infer differences in plant metabolism."

 Monitoring coarse-grained sediment is essential for managing riverbed stability, flood capacity, and ecological resilience in the Yellow River, where high sediment loads originate from the erosion-prone Loess Plateau. Although large-scale ecological restoration has been implemented since the 1980s, its long-term impact on sediment grain-size dynamics remains unclear due to limited field observations. This study developed a dual-layer random forest model that synergizes Landsat satellites reflectance (1986–2022) with multi-scale watershed attributes (hydrological information, vegetation coverage, erosion susceptibility) to remotely quantify particle size distribution (PSD) of suspended sediment. The model achieved high precision (root mean square error: 2.94–4.82 %; mean absolute percentage difference: 13.44–19.87 %), enabling the first basin-wide PSD reconstruction. Key findings reveal: (1) Medium-sized particles (0.01–0.05 mm) dominated the mainstream (63.96 %), while coarse (>0.05 mm, 67.80 %) and fine particles (<0.01 mm, 25.70 %) were concentrated in the Fen and Wei Rivers, respectively; (2) Median grain size decreased by 7.25 % during the 1980s–2020s, reflecting the cumulative effects of ecological restoration, though localized coarsening (1.27, 2.39 and 2.61 %) occurred in the Huangshui, Wei, and Jing Rivers; and (3) Vegetation expansion (8.50–51.23 %) and urbanization (impervious surfaces (12.90–17.04 %)) drove particle fining, while increased wind/water erosion increased the proportion of coarse particle. This study fills a critical gap in monitoring suspended particle size dynamics and provides a scalable framework for evaluating ecological restoration outcomes and informing suspended sediment management in large, sediment-rich watersheds."

 Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) constitute one of the most critical data sources assimilated in numerical weather prediction (NWP), yet current operational wind products fall short to meet forecast requirements. This study addresses a fundamental observational gap in satellite wind retrievals. Traditional polar-orbiting satellite retrievals are limited to high latitudes, and geostationary AMV products are restricted to mid-low latitudes. In the resulting gap regions, only morning-orbit Metop infrared AMVs currently provide limited coverage. This study introduces an optical flow-based atmospheric motion vector retrieval method employing spatiotemporal matching of 183.31 GHz microwave water vapor channel brightness temperatures from NOAA-20/21 Advanced Technology Microwave Sounders (ATMS), enabling highly vertically resolved wind retrievals with clear-sky pixels. Using a fixed 5° × 5° feature tracking regions (5° FTR), the wind speed bias ranges from 0.16 to 0.64 m·s−1, the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 3.45 to 3.81 m·s−1, and the wind direction bias was consistently constrained below 27.4°. The overall accuracy achieves the error levels of existing products.For extremely wind speed conditions, a hybrid-scale FTR optimization model, 3° FTR for slow wind speed region and 10° FTR for those high wind speed region, is also proposed. It can expand the detectable wind speed range from 45 m·s−1 to 70 m·s−1 with a sample size increase of over 10 % per channel. The RMSE for 3° FTR reduces by 0.5 m·s−1, while the 10° FTR achieves a 1.5° reduction in both angular deviations and their standard deviation (STD) at 500 and 450 hPa. For all the hybrid regions in all channels, the RMSE remains within 3.47–3.79 m·s−1, the correlation coefficient is enhanced by about 10 % and the wind direction bias is almost the same as that of the fixed FTR. This hybrid-scale tracking strategy can effectively balance spatial resolution and statistical reliability, and thus provides a new technical paradigm for polar-orbiting microwave AMV retrieval. The resulting afternoon-orbit microwave AMVs deliver a novel wind data source for NWP assimilation systems."

 Agricultural droughts, driven by deficits in root-zone soil moisture, pose challenges to food security and economic stability in Africa, which is simultaneously vulnerable to frequent droughts and strongly relies on rainfed agriculture. Current Earth observation (EO)-based monitoring systems rely on a near-real-time assessment of vegetation conditions — often through monitoring the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)- and are thereby allowing for reactive rather than proactive drought management. This study presents a machine learning-based forecasting system to predict below-average NDVI anomalies as a proxy for agricultural drought impact, focusing on recently drought-affected and crises-prone countries. By integrating EO data, meteorological forecasts, soil moisture, and static environmental descriptors, we developed a system that forecasts below-average NDVI anomalies up to three months in advance and explicitly considers ensemble uncertainty. The forecast shows an improved accuracy over using near-real-time NDVI anomalies and similar temporal patterns during the 2021–2022 growing seasons, which was used for independent validation. Our forecasted results are comparable to existing NDVI-based monitoring products such as the Agricultural Stress Index System developed by FAO. Despite these advancements, the modelling system struggles during transitions between rainy and dry seasons, often coinciding with the start and end of the growing season. Uncertainties in meteorological forecasts burden effective estimates of important phenological dates such as emergence or harvest up to three months in advance. This study complements existing soil moisture forecasting tools with impact on vegetation and presents a benchmark for the potential of integrating predictive models into anticipatory strategies in existing drought management frameworks."

 Deadwood and decaying wood are the most important components for the biodiversity of boreal forests, and around a quarter of all flora and fauna in Finnish forests depend on them, with third of these species being red-listed. However, there is a severe lack of stand-level deadwood data in Finland, as the operational inventories either focus on the large-scale estimates or omit deadwood altogether. Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a cost-effective method for remotely mapping small objects, such as fallen deadwood, over compartment-level areas, as even the most spatially accurate commercial satellites and aerial photography provide 30 cm ground sampling distance, compared to less than 5 cm that is easily achievable with UAVs.In this study, we utilized YOLOv8 by Ultralytics for detecting and segmenting standing and fallen deadwood instances from RGB UAV imagery. Our study consists of two geographically distinct study areas in Finland, Hiidenportti National Park and Evo. We manually annotated around 13 800 deadwood instances to be used as the training and validation data for the instance segmentation models. These annotations were also compared to field-measured deadwood data from Hiidenportti to assess the extent on how much of the deadwood can even be seen from UAV imagery. We also compared how the models perform on another area than from which its training dataset was from, and whether adding data from another areas to the training dataset improves the performance compared to training only with images from one location.The best performing model achieved test set mask mAP50 score of 0.682 for Hiidenportti and 0.651 for Sudenpesänkangas datasets. For both areas, including imagery from the another area improved the instance segmentation metrics, whereas using data only from another site to train the models produced significantly worse results. While methods utilizing UAV imagery cannot completely replace traditional field work, they should still be considered as an additional tool for field campaigns."

 Poverty is a pervasive global issue that adversely affects human well-being. Traditional socioeconomic censuses are time-consuming and resource-intensive, suffering from temporal delays, while reliance on nighttime light data with low spatial resolution is insufficient for fine-scale identification of impoverished regions. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of nighttime light in different urban functional zones has been overlooked. To address these shortcomings, we proposed a novel approach by integrating high-resolution SDGSAT-1 nighttime light data (10 m) with urban functional zoning data using a spatial overlay tool. A random forest model was then applied to predict county-level poverty identification in Guangdong, China. For comparative validation, traditional NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data (500 m) were also incorporated. This method effectively explored the nonlinear relationship between nighttime light, urban functional zones, and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI, serving as the dependent variable). Our experiments demonstrate that the integration of urban functional zoning with nighttime light moderately improves the accuracy of poverty estimates. Among the models tested, the one considering functional zoning-based indicators of “number of light pixels” and “sum of pixel light values” increased the correlation coefficient by 0.0158 compared to the model without considering these indicators. Additionally, comparative analysis revealed that high-resolution data from SDGSAT-1 exhibited a better fit with the MPI when integrated with functional zoning-based indicators. Specifically, the correlation coefficient of this combination was 0.0086 higher than that of traditional NPP-VIIRS data. This highlights that SDGSAT-1 can delineate the boundaries between dark and light regions more precisely, leading to a more accurate reflection of regional poverty levels. Our findings facilitate fine-scale poverty estimation across large regions. This approach can inform policy design, such as dynamic optimization of resource allocation based on poverty estimates, thus enabling timely and accurate poverty alleviation efforts."

 Mangroves play a critical role in maintaining biodiversity, supporting global carbon and nitrogen cycles, and contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accurate estimation of their nitrogen and phosphorus content is essential for assessing the status of mangrove ecosystems. However, the spectral response characteristics of mangrove leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and leaf phosphorus content (LPC) remain unclear. These knowledge gaps hinder the development of robust predictive models across diverse environmental contexts. To overcome these issues, we collected 375 samples and 16,590 in situ full-spectrum hyperspectral data, and further proposed a novel Global-Fractional Order Sensitivity Analysis (G-FOSA) method. We analyzed for the first time the apparent and deep spectral characteristics of LNC and LPC for four typical mangrove species in China (Avicennia marina, Acanthus ilicifolius, Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculatum) using G-FOSA method. This study revealed that the LNC diagnostic wavelengths concentrated in the range of 697 nm–704 nm, while the LPC diagnostic wavelengths were mostly distributed between 691 nm–834 nm and 1869 nm–2236 nm. We developed a mechanism-guided retrieval framework based on these diagnostic wavelengths, and achieved the quantitative inversion from field diagnostic wavelengths to optical satellite (SDGSAT-1 and Sentinel-2) bands. Our experiment results confirmed that SDGSAT-1, the world's first science satellite dedicated to serving the 2030 Agenda for SDGs, performs better in estimating LNC and LPC (R2 = 0.63). Finally, we utilized the advantages of cross-scenario transfer learning technology to design a novel domain adaptive transfer learning (DTL) model, which realized the cross-scenario retrieval of mangrove LNC and LPC across three typical mangrove regions, reducing estimation error (RMSE) by 0.6 %–41.1 % compared to the traditional FTL model.

 Remote detection of plastic litter in both marine and freshwater environments using satellite measurements has become a hot research topic in the past decade, where numerous papers have shown “successful” algorithm development and applications. However, many of these results appear to need some revisits because, in logic, the causality of A to B (i.e., A  => B) does not lead to the inference of B => A unless A is the only reason to cause B. In practice, even though plastics can lead to a certain type of signal anomaly (e.g., spectral, spatial, backscattering) from controlled experiments, the same anomaly detected from the natural environments cannot be used to infer plastics unless other possible reasons can all be ruled out. This is especially true when considering that non-plastic floating matters are much more ubiquitous in the aquatic environments. Unfortunately, this logic has been missing in many, if not most, publications. Here, using spectral reflectances of various types of floating matters and through demonstrations of several examples, I show why such logic is critical in remote detection of plastic litter and why pixel averaging and subtraction are necessary steps to spectrally discriminate the signal anomaly in multi-band optical remote sensing imagery. It is argued that unless other possibilities are ruled out using imaging spectroscopy or other means, it is premature to attribute the detected signal anomaly to plastic litter. After all, not every anomaly pixel is necessarily due to litter, and not every litter pixel is necessarily due to plastics unless proven otherwise."

 Serving as a powerful proxy in remote sensing studies, spectral indices can generate meaningful environmental interpretation from either raw or atmospherically corrected spectral data, and characterise and quantify some important properties of various objects on Earth’s surface. However, while numerous spectral indices have been developed over time, since the very launch of civilian satellites until now, some critical issues in their usage, such as comparability, remain scarcely studied, which may lead to incorrect, inconsistent, and unreliable results.In this study, we collected 471 spectral indices of various environment components (vegetation, water, and soil) that might be leveraged for soil studies, and traced their popularity in scientific publications over the past decades. The bibliometric analysis revealed a growing interest and utilisation of spectral indices as Earth-observing satellite technology advanced. Based on both literature and, for sake of complementation and illustration, some targeted regional-scale case studies, we discuss the issues of naming confusion, comparability, applicability, accuracy trade-offs, and reproducibility of using spectral indices.Overall, this overview provides an extensive list of spectral indices, both soil indices and soil-related indices, that can be useful for characterising these environment components by remote sensing. It draws attention to some misuses and confusions that must be avoided to prevent scientific pitfalls. The comparisons between different spectral indices, sensors, and correction methods, highlight the confusing effects that the misuse and non-standardised practices of the spectral indices useful for soil, may have on soil property mapping and monitoring.

 This paper shows the first demonstration of spaceborne L-band bistatic InSAR from the Chinese Lutan-1 mission for forest vertical structural information retrieval (in this work, namely, vertical profile, forest height, and underlying topography). With the single-polarization/baseline bistatic InSAR mode of Lutan-1, the measured few-look InSAR phase height histograms compare very well with the GEDI lidar waveforms, both capturing similar characteristics of the forest vertical structural profile. The ground finding approach based on the few-look InSAR phase height histogram is further adapted to incorporate spaceborne lidar measurements from GEDI and ICESat-2/ATLAS for more robust calibration. As for the DTM estimation, two ground finding strategies are developed: one using ample spaceborne lidar samples (with the lidar height as the feature), and the other using limited spaceborne lidar samples (with the few-look InSAR phase height standard deviation as the feature), both of which rely on the statistical model relating the underlying terrain elevation to the statistics of the few-look InSAR histogram. Then, forest height is inverted using the few-look histogram that mimics using lidar waveform to derive height metrics. The large-scale DTM and forest height mosaics of 2.74 million hectares are produced over tropical rainforest of the entire Hainan island of China. Through validation with airborne lidar data, the forest height is estimated to an accuracy of ∼5 m for tropical forest up to 45 m tall (relative error 10–15 %). The InSAR-derived DTM has a negligible bias (mean value of the radar-lidar DTM deviation) as referenced to airborne lidar DTM, with the uncertainties (median absolute deviation or MAD) being dependent on topographic surface slopes: 3 m (<2°), 4 m (2°-6°), 7 m (6°-25°), and 9 m (>25°). This approach sheds light on combining ascending/descending viewing geometries of spaceborne L-band bistatic InSAR data with single polarization/baseline (e.g. Lutan-1 and its follow-on) for large-scale wall-to-wall mapping of forest vertical structural profile, height metrics/biomass, underlying topography, as well as the changes of these forest parameters."

 Accurate river water level estimation is essential for effective flood monitoring and water resources management. However, traditional techniques and single satellite observations have low accuracy and resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance river water level estimation by fusing Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery based on advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. SAR provides high-resolution, all-weather surface imagery, while the GNSS-Reflectometry from the eight-satellite CYGNSS mission offers frequent and wide-coverage observations. Dynamic river water levels are obtained at a daily temporal resolution by extracting changes in Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficients and integrating them with the CYGNSS data's high temporal resolution feature. To guarantee the model's robustness, a ten-fold cross-validation (CV) procedure is used with incorporating 15 uniformly distributed gauge sites. Experimental results show that the data fusion method significantly improved the temporal resolution, and more importantly the precision of water level estimation. As opposed to the model without data fusion, the optimized fusion algorithm achieved a 50.74 % reduction in RMSE from 0.341 to 0.168 m, while the R was improved from 0.876 to 0.936. An improvement of over 35 % in RMSE was observed at 8 out of 15 stations. To further validate the model's generalizability, we tested it using data from 8 spatially and temporally independent hydrological stations. The fusion method reduced the RMSE from 0.479 to 0.202 m and increased the R from 0.848 to 0.927, further confirming its effectiveness in enhancing water level estimation. The findings indicate that integrating SAR imagery and CYGNSS time series data has complementary effects and enables better water level estimation."

 Permafrost degradation has been recognized for decades due to climate warming, wildfire, and infrastructure development. However, a large-scale characterization of permafrost thaw status has not been attempted before due to difficulties in ground data collection, inherent complications and heterogeneity of thaw in ecosystem-protected permafrost, and constraints of remote sensor observations and process-based modeling techniques. Here we made a first effort to map the status of permafrost thaw across a large ice-rich lowland fire-influenced landscape (2500 km2) in interior Alaska by developing a new protocol and combining decades of field measurements, repeat airborne lidar, spaceborne WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat time series products, and a terrain elevation dataset. The repeat lidar and fine-resolution imagery offered a key to solving the bottleneck issue of thaw reference data collection, which further provided an opportunity to track post-fire thaw caused by six large fires in the past 25 years in four stages over time: old thaw, lateral thaw, vertical shallow thaw and vertical deep thaw. The developed protocol achieved an overall accuracy of 79 % in classifying these thaw stages and generated a reasonable thaw pattern mainly controlled by fires and locally modified by other drivers. Identifying degradation patterns can help understand the permafrost-fire-climate system. The protocol is a valuable alternative to current thermokarst mapping techniques."

 The remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) varies with the illumination and viewing geometry, an effect referred to as anisotropy, bidirectionality, or bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). In the aquatic environment, bidirectionality arises from the anisotropic downwelling illumination, scattered by water and particles in varying proportions as a function of the scattering angle, and modulated by the two-way interaction with the sea surface. For remote sensing applications, it is desirable that the reflectance only depends on the inherent optical properties (IOPs). This process implies transforming Rrs into a “corrected” or “normalized” Rrs,N, referred to the sun at the zenith and the sensor zenith angle at the nadir. A recent review study (D'Alimonte et al., 2025) compared published BRDF methods, showing the better performance of that developed by Lee et al. (2011, henceforth L11) with respect to those proposed by Morel et al. (2002) and Park and Ruddick (2005). This article presents a new method starting from L11's analytical framework, named O25 after OLCI, the Ocean Colour sensor on Sentinel-3 satellite. O25 has been calibrated with a recently published synthetic dataset tailored to its needs (Pitarch and Brando, 2025). A comparative assessment using the same datasets as in D'Alimonte et al. (2025) concludes that O25 outperforms L11 and hence all pre-existing methods. O25 includes complementary operational features: (1) applicability range, (2) uncertainty estimates, and (3) a demonstrated reversibility of the bidirectional correction. O25's look-up tables are generic to any in situ and satellite sensors, including hyperspectral ones. For sensors such as Landsat/Sentinel 2, the IOPs retrieval component of O25 can easily be reformulated."

 Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a critical state variable for water cycle research, and the advances in satellite remote sensing technology have provided a novel means for acquiring large-scale SSM data. While satellite microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrieval has emerged as the dominant approach for global SSM product development, offering numerous advantages, it still faces significant challenges. These include the trade-off between model accuracy and generalizability, the limitations of applying uniform retrieval models across diverse environments, and the inherent complexity and computational demands of the retrieval process. To address these common issues in microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrieval studies, this study proposed a cloud-based intelligent retrieval framework for global high-accuracy SSM estimation. This framework integrated physical mechanisms with machine learning models to ensure robust generalization and high retrieval accuracy; additionally, a model selection module was incorporated to enhance the overall retrieval accuracy by providing environment-specific retrieval models. In an assessment based on global validation sites for 1-km resolution SSM retrieval, the proposed framework performed well, with an R value of 0.851 and an ubRMSE of 0.058 m3·m−3. Furthermore, to mitigate the computational resource demands and time-consuming of the retrieval process, the SSM retrieval framework was implemented in a cloud environment utilizing Google Earth Engine, Drive, and Colab, thereby enabling seamless online operation of the entire retrieval process. This cloud-based intelligent retrieval framework facilitates real-time point-scale SSM retrieval on a global scale and rapid production of high-accuracy SSM products at the regional scale (SSM products for China at 1 km resolution can be accessed via https://tinyurl.com/SSMproduct). The SSM retrieval framework can significantly contribute to agricultural, environmental, and other related fields, and serve as a reference for the retrieval of other environmental variables."

 Long-term river discharge time series are essential for assessing water availability, seasonal variability, and the impacts of climate change. However, in-situ data do not ensure continuity and large-scale availability, as they are constrained by the limitations of monitoring networks, which are affected by high maintenance costs, geopolitical factors, and the remoteness of many river basins. Satellite remote sensing offers a valuable alternative, with multispectral data providing information on river discharge dynamics. Nevertheless, also satellite data suffer discontinuity, being periodically decommissioned and substituted by sensors with different characteristics.This study applies and refines the Calibration-Measurement (CM) approach across 54 river sites worldwide, using 10 different multispectral satellite products from 8 satellite sensors to examine long time series of data. The methodology optimizes the selection of reflectance indices based on local hydrological conditions, evaluating the best procedure to obtain river discharge proxies according to the specific flow regimes and climatic condition. Multi-mission data are then combined to improve temporal coverage and accuracy, obtaining long-term timeseries of river discharge proxies. A new uncalibrated procedure is also introduced to extract river discharge information in sites with decommissioned stations or to obtain the CM proxies in ungauged basins.Results demonstrate that integrating multiple satellite sources substantially improves river discharge estimation, due to factor such as the superior performance of high-resolution sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) over coarse-resolution datasets (e.g. MODIS) in narrow rivers, and the complementary value of MODIS finer temporal resolution. The proposed merging approach enhances data consistency and reduces gaps while maintaining good performance values, while the uncalibrated method proves effective in many cases but remains challenging for frozen rivers, cloud-prone regions and areas with a low ratio between river width and satellite sensor spatial resolution. Specifically, after the application of a Cumulative Distribution Function Merging (CDF) matching to obtain river discharge estimates from CM proxies, the average and maximum value of Spearman's correlation for the calibrated approaches are respectively 0.78 and 0.92 whereas for uncalibrated approach are 0.55 and 0.89; in terms of Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) the average and maximum value are 0.41 and 0.85 for calibrated approach and 0.29 and 0.8 for the uncalibrated one.These findings highlight the potential of multi-sensor approaches for global river discharge monitoring and lay the groundwork for future operational applications."

 Due to its ability to provide day-and-night profiling and high depth resolution, ocean lidar has become an important tool for marine remote sensing. However, a lidar system provides time-based measurements of backscattered photons, where the distance (or depth for vertical profiling) is a product of light speed in water and the time photons pass. When there are significant contributions of multiple scattering in the backscattered signals of ocean lidar, the perceived depth of these measured photons will be deeper than the real depth. Therefore, if the objective of a lidar system is to sense the vertical profile of particles, the present time-based depth profile will not match the real depth profile of particles in the water column. To address this discrepancy, we carried out semi-analytical Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of water properties (represented by scattering coefficient, b), focusing on Case-1 water, with platforms including spaceborne, airborne, shipborne, and underwater. In the simulation process, it is assumed that the water column is vertically homogeneous, and the influence of sea surface fluctuations is ignored. Based on the simulated data, relationships between the discrepancy and b, as well as the radius of the received footprint on the water surface (rs), are established. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the discrepancy is more sensitive to b than to rs. Further, the impact of the absorption coefficient, scattering phase function, rough sea surface, and vertically non-uniform inherent optical properties on this discrepancy is discussed. Our results not only highlight the significance of considering multiple scattering, particularly for airborne and spaceborne platforms, in sensing the vertical profiles of particles but also provide guidance for interpreting backscattered signals in ocean lidar applications."

 Mangroves, as cradles of biodiversity and blue carbon reservoirs, are facing survival challenges due to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Precise and rapid mapping of mangrove forests has thus become highly relevant, which can provide essential information to support the conservation practices of such blue carbon resources. Existing machine learning algorithms for mangrove mapping are incapable of delivering precise cartographic solutions under dynamic tidal conditions because of poor transferability. This study developed a generalized approach for large-area mangrove mapping using a hybrid neural network integrated with a vision transformer to effectively capture representative features. To adapt mangrove mapping to the variety of tidal conditions, a vision transformer architecture was developed by encoding the fusion of three Sentinel-2 bands: Green, NIR, and SWIR. The ground truth dataset for the year 2021 was created from the composited Sentinel-2 images after interpreting Google Earth and drone images, which comprised 88,645 training samples (256 × 256 pixels per sample) and 24,969 test samples. We selected 30 coastal counties as test dataset in China to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed network and produced a 10 m mangrove map that reported a total mangrove area of 28,006.24 ha in China in 2021, yielding an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.91 %. Compared to existing data products, Global Mangrove Watch 3.0, ESA WorldCover V200 and HGMF, our method outperformed the second-best product HGMF in mixed tide regions, by a margin of 9.19 % in OA and by 9.36 % in mean F1 score. Despite fluctuations in tide levels captured by Sentinel-2 imagery, the proposed method consistently yielded robust mangrove mapping results, highlighting effective derivation of tidal information. In comparison with previous mapping methods, the superior efficacy of the proposed network is distinctly discernible in distinguishing and delineating mangrove ecosystems in mixed tide regions, presenting prospects for improved monitoring of mangroves at regional and global scales."

 Accurately measuring mariculture’s area and spatial distribution is vital for the sustainable development of marine resources. However, existing research primarily focuses on the regional scale, while national mariculture studies remain limited, with significant differences in extracted areas. This study utilized time-series Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery and developed the Efficient Multi-scale Attention U-Net (EMA-UNet) to generate a fine-grained map of China’s mariculture. The spatial distribution characteristics of mariculture areas were revealed through spatial analysis methods. The results showed that: (1) The EMA-UNet proposed in this study achieved higher accuracy than comparative models, with an overall accuracy of 95.9 %, an F1 score of 94.3 %, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 89.4 %, with improved extraction effects.

 While numerous studies have evaluated precipitation products by comparing them with in-situ observations, the suitability of these products for closing the water balance budget in Africa remains largely unexplored. This study assesses the performance of eight latest precipitation products, namely MSWEP v2.8, CRU v4.07, CHIRPS v2.0, ERA5-Land, CPC, NOAH, IMERG v7, and MSWX v1, in closing the water balance budget over Africa. We begin by assessing the general consistency among these precipitation products using rain-gauge measurements and multiple linear regression analysis, followed by the generalized three-corner-hat (GTCH) method applied to estimate the relative uncertainties and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios of the eight precipitation products, which help identify the potential causes of the water balance non-closure over Africa. To evaluate the suitability for closing the water balance budget, we compare the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO, hereafter GRACE) satellite missions’ derived total water storage changes (TWSC) with those of the water balance equation using each precipitation product. The influence of climate zones and terrain on these evaluations is also examined. The results reveal significant discrepancies in precipitation trends among the eight precipitation products. The GTCH analysis indicates that MSWEP achieves the lowest uncertainties and highest SNR values in most cases, followed by MSWX and CHIPRS. Regarding closing the water balance budget, NOAH exhibits the highest consistency with GRACE-derived TWSC than other products, followed by IMERG, whereas CPC achieved the lowest suitability. The performance of these products appears to be more influenced by climatic regimes than by terrain. All precipitation products indicate approximately 20% non-closure in the water balance budget over Africa, likely due to the underestimation of annual signals, as revealed by the principal component analysis (PCA). This study underscores that utilizing precipitation derived from the same data source as runoff and evapotranspiration demonstrates high consistency with GRACE-derived TWSC data. These findings suggest that precipitation estimates should merge multi-source datasets and consider the water balance budget, which can help reduce uncertainties and provide a more reliable foundation for hydrological studies in Africa."

 This study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different Earth Observation (EO) products for assessing olive trees’ health in a 6.2 ha orchard. We developed a digital crop mapping approach using high-resolution multispectral imagery from three sources: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at 2 cm spatial resolution, Mohammed VI satellite at 50 cm, and Sentinel-2 satellite at 10 m. Leaf chlorophyll content, measured for 75 trees using a SPAD meter, served as the dependent variable for predictive modeling and a proxy of trees’ health. Furthermore, three machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF), Cubist, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to predict chlorophyll content. The RF model showed superior performance across all datasets, achieving the lowest RMSE values. While UAV data provided the highest spatial detail, capturing fine-scale health variations, it came at a significantly higher cost. The commercial Mohammed VI satellite data offered a balance between detail and coverage, potentially cost-effective for areas approaching its 100 km2 minimum purchase requirement. However, the free Sentinel-2 data showed competitive performance, particularly with the RF model (RMSE: 7.773, RPIQ: 1.251), suggesting its viability for large-scale monitoring. Spatial chlorophyll maps revealed distinct capabilities of each EO product in capturing orchard variability. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between EO product costs, resolutions, and predictive accuracy, providing crucial insights for selecting appropriate remote sensing approaches based on specific monitoring requirements and budget constraints.

 In most West African countries, water authorities face real challenges in monitoring and managing lakes. These challenges include the limitation of resources for continuous field-based data collection for the assessment of both the ecological status and the implementation of regulations measures on these water bodies. In such a context, remote sensing-based monitoring could provide a sustainable solution. The current study used EO data Sentinel-1 SAR to develop a classification approach for detection a traditional fish method using dry branches (called acadja), and water hyacinth (which mainly occurs in acadja) in Lake Nokoué (Benin). The employed method analyses the distribution of VV and VH polarisation values to determine the boundary (threshold interval) between acadjas and water hyacinth objects on one hand, and open water on the other. This analysis, referred to as a ’quartile-based threshold analysis’, was conducted from 2019 to 2023, taking seasonal variations into account. The study results show that VH polarisation is a more stable method for detecting acadjas and water hyacinths. The overall accuracy of object detection is 87%, with a confusion rate of less than 5% throughout the study period.

Results showed that 91% of crop seasons were detected using the Sen2Like fused product compared to 88% using Sentinel-2 alone. For both datasets, the Start of Season (SOS) for summer crops presented a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 35 days from the calendar date, while the SOS for winter crops had an RMSE of about 14 days. Due to its daily temporal coverage, PlanetScope data was used for additional evaluation.

 The radiometric temperature of the plants is known to be a good indicator of their level of water stress. The use of thermal cameras on board UAVs allows operational monitoring of the canopy temperature in orchard plantations at the single-tree level. The radiometric processing of the flight data becomes critical in this task to maintain the accuracy provided by field measurements using proximal thermal radiometers. This work focuses on evaluating the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) as a good indicator of the plant water status in almond orchards. This study compares the performance of CWSI by three different techniques: i) using proximal high-precision thermal radiometry (CWSI_CIMEL); ii) by UAV thermal flights for canopy temperature assessment (CWSI_UAV) and iii) combining multispectral and thermal data, also by UAV, to run a simplified two-source surface energy balance for the traditional formulation of the CWSI in terms of canopy transpiration (CWSI_STSEB).This study was conducted on two commercials almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb) orchards located in Albacete (SE Spain), one of them with 3 irrigation treatments (well-watered, moderate water stress, and severe water stress). Periodic measurements of stem water potential (SWP) were carried out around noon throughout 3 experimental campaigns from 2019 to 2021. Canopy temperature measurements were made with a high-precision thermal radiometer, the CIMEL CE312-C2. In addition, six flights were carried out using a DJI-M600 drone equipped with a FLIR Tau2 thermal sensor and a Micasense RedEdge camera. Maps of the CWSI were performed during these dates, showing temporal and spatial variability. The three different techniques showed similar CWSI trends across dates and treatments. When treatments were pooled within the same date, the assessment with SWP measurements showed correlations (R2) of 0.86, 0.68, and 0.70 for CWSI_CIMEL, CWSI_UAV, and CWSI_STSEB, respectively. These results reinforce the potential of accurate measurements of radiometric canopy temperatures using both proximal and remote sensing techniques to reproduce the crop water status in almond orchards.

 Northeast China is one of China’s most important rice production bases, contributing about one-fifth of the country’s rice production. In recent years, several agricultural policies have been implemented in Northeast China to adjust crop structures, driven by economic and ecological benefits. Timely monitoring of the changed pattern of rice cultivation is a prerequisite for policy assessment. Current paddy rice mapping methods are experiencing uncertainties due to confusion with wetlands and are highly parameter-dependent. To these, in this study, we developed a paddy rice mapping framework that integrates automatically generated training samples, time series features from key cultivation stages, and a deep learning model to improve paddy rice identification accuracy in Northeast China, which is a typical rice-wetland coexisting area. We produced 10 m paddy rice maps for 2019–2023 in Northeast China and examined their changes under agricultural policy implementation. The resultant paddy rice maps have high accuracies, with overall accuracies >0.97, producer’s accuracies >0.94, user’s accuracies ≥0.93, and F1 scores of ≥0.95, respectively. Our proposed mapping method effectively identified small patches of paddy rice and reduced confusion with wetlands. Paddy rice areas in Northeast China estimated in this study continued to decrease annually from 71.1 × 103 km2 in 2019 to 56.4 × 103 km2 in 2023. Hot spots of rice conversion to other crops were found in the Sanjiang Plain, mainly due to the Soybean Revitalization Plan. The rice cultivation expansion was mainly found in the Songnen Plain, resulting from policies on Rehabilitation and Utilization of Saline Soils.

 Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), a perennial legume forage crop, is valued for its high yield and quality. However, its survival during winter can be affected by several factors, and its mortality significantly impacts alfalfa production, necessitating timely and spatially detailed monitoring. This study aims to propose a framework for estimating alfalfa stem density using satellite imagery and machine learning (ML) algorithms, which can lead to winter mortality detection early in the spring and provide a better understanding of potential total dry matter. Three ML models—support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)—were applied to Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (Landsat only, which is HLSL30) and Sentinel-2 datasets, accessed via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API. Two scenarios were evaluated: 1) single-date data, capturing satellite images within a 3-day time window to the date of field sample measurement, and 2) time-series data, in which three satellite images were collected for the measurements during the first growing cycle. Both classification and regression models were used in both scenarios to estimate and classify alfalfa stem density. ML Classification models categorized stem density into four groups (bare, low-density, medium-density, and high-density), achieving an accuracy of up to 85 % using Sentinel-2 data and 84 % using HLSL30 data. The results also indicated that alfalfa stem density can be estimated with an error of ∼ ±6-9 stems/foot2 (1 foot = 30.48 cm) using ML regression models. RF outperformed XGB and SVM in classification and regression tasks, showing superior accuracy in classifying density and lower root mean square error (RMSE) in estimating stem density.

Existing methods align visual and textual features through cross-modal fusion but often fail to capture object dependencies, hindering complex visual reasoning about relationships and contexts. To address this, we introduce the Luojia-VG dataset, a benchmark enhancing visual reasoning with scene knowledge, including object-level annotations and contextual descriptions of relationships, functions, and activities.

The DKF module progressively embeds scene knowledge into multi-scale visual features via cross-attention, enhancing the model’s fine-grained understanding of scene contexts. The QRA module aligns image regions with the query by concentrating on the most contextually relevant areas for precise localization.

 Multi-view reconstruction of real-world scenes has been an important and challenging task. Although methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in rendering quality, there are still some limitations regarding the fidelity of geometric structures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 3D reconstruction approach within the 3DGS framework, integrating lidar point clouds and multi-view images, named LiDGS, which achieves high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction by introducing high-precision geometric a priori information and multiple geometric constraints from lidar point clouds, while guaranteeing efficient and accurate scene rendering. Specifically, we adopt an adaptive checkerboard sampling strategy and multi-hypothesis joint view selection (ACMP) for whole-image depth propagation, generating a high −precision dense depth map that provides continuous and accurate depth prior constraints for Gaussian optimization. Then, we design an adaptive Gaussian densification strategy, which effectively guides the geometric structure of the 3D scene through geometric anchors and adaptively adjusts the number and volume of Gaussians to more finely characterize the geometry of the object surface. Finally, this paper introduces a depth regularization method to correct the depth estimation of each Gaussian, ensuring the consistency of depth information from different viewpoints, which, in turn, improves the reconstruction quality. The experimental results show that the method achieves superior performance in both the new view synthesis task and the 3D reconstruction task, outperforming other classical methods.

 Co-occurrence can improve the perception and prediction of traffic entities by predicting another traffic entity in automated driving based on a known entity. Existing traffic entity co-occurrence relationship construction methods use a bottom-up approach that relies on labeled datasets. However, the limited nature of datasets constrains the capture of long-tail scenarios. High-definition (HD) maps define the concept of traffic elements and their classifications, and can be used for scene simulation and real-time updating of digital twins. Based on this, this paper proposes a knowledge graph construction method for traffic entity prediction, employing a top-down approach and introducing HD maps. This method establishes a co-occurring semantic network between entities, utilizing prior knowledge. The objective is to reconcile the finiteness of datasets with the infinity of long-tailed scenarios, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the safety calibration of autonomous driving. The experimental results show that the knowledge graph constructed by the top-down method has a complete ontology type in the schema and takes into account the co-occurrence relations of the long-tailed scenarios, which provides a basis for the standardization of the co-occurrence relationships of the long-tailed scenarios, and also provides semantic support for the dynamic simulation of the digital twins in traffic scenes."

 Complete spatial randomness (CSR) describes a fully homogeneous random distribution of species across space, where every location within a study area has an equal probability of hosting individuals. However, previous literature often conflates the roles of the Poisson and uniform distributions in representing CSR. While the homogeneous nature of CSR intuitively suggests a connection to the uniform distribution, it is less clear how the Poisson distribution can achieve this. In this study, we provide a statistical explanation, demonstrating that the Poisson distribution, and the exponential waiting time derived from it, the uniform distribution, and CSR are all mathematically equivalent under the same probabilistic framework. We present interpretations from both a simulation algorithm perspective and a statistical sampling perspective, supported by appropriate statistical reasoning.

 Vegetation leaf area index (LAI) data with continuous spatio-temporal coverage are crucial for monitoring vegetation growth, predicting crop yields, and studying global environmental changes. However, due to limitations of recent satellite observations and retrieval algorithms, the prevailing operational LAI product is of low spatial resolution, which is insufficient to support fine-scale detection of land surface vegetation changes. To overcome these challenges, a novel data assimilation approach, the ENKF-NDVI (Ensemble Kalman Filter-NDVI) model, was developed to estimate LAI data with 10-m spatial and 5-day temporal resolution. Time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with 30-m spatial and 5-day temporal resolution were used instead of 500-m resolution LAI data to depict vegetation change trends and solve the patch effects caused by the scale differences.

Validation with ground-based measurements indicates a high accuracy with R2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.39.

 Sufficient abundance and variety of field site sampling are crucial for obtaining an accurate reach-scale river classification of a regional stream network in support of scientific research and river management. However, many studies still randomly select field sites or only visit accessible streams. This leads to an inadequate exploration of stream characteristics, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate classification. Machine learning has been recognized for discovering and extracting streams’ geomorphic patterns efficiently and accurately from data, but its application in field site sampling design is still in its infancy. This study developed a general and practical field site selection framework by incorporating machine learning in a human-in-the-loop manner. This framework includes three steps: (1) initial field site selection via machine learning from prior datasets, (2) selected field site accessibility evaluation and observation, and (3) additional field site decision and selection via an iterative learning process. In an example application to the San Francisco Bay Area (California, USA), our framework extracted representative geomorphic characteristics of (i) previous known stream types from prior labeled and geospatial datasets and (ii) previously unrecognized stream types based on uncertainty information obtained by machine learning. Moreover, we propose methods for replacing inaccessible sites to ensure sufficient information is retained in the selected field sites. Results revealed clear differences in variable distributions between the 148 high‐certainty sites and the 51 high‐uncertainty sites, a pattern that was validated by our field surveys. Furthermore, the 41 newly identified high‐uncertainty sites were found under-represented in the initial surveyed sites and thus their selection for the next round of field surveys will help fill the important feature gaps left by the initial survey.

 Forest ecosystems underpin global ecological security, yet China’s forest landscapes are subjected to dual pressures of restoration and degradation, with complex spatiotemporal dynamics that remain insufficiently understood. While existing studies focus on static landscape metrics, the nonlinear interactions between natural and anthropogenic drivers of forest fragmentation and connectivity remain elusive. This study addresses this gap by introducing the Ecological Land Evolution Index (ELEI) to quantify patch-scale forest dynamics, integrating multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) with XGBoost-SHAP analysis to dissect driving mechanisms across China from 2000 to 2020. Key findings reveal distinct spatial patterns: Ecological Land Restoration (ELR) processes with high connectivity potential concentrated in northeastern China, the Qinba Mountains, and southwestern regions. “Connection-type” patches (comprising 48 % of ELR area) dominated low-elevation plains (e.g., Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau), while “infilling-type” restoration prevailed in hilly/mountainous areas, driven by shrubland-to-forest conversions. Ecological Land Degradation (ELD) driven by cropland expansion caused severe fragmentation in the Sichuan Basin and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.”Enclosing-type” ELD dominated high-relief mountains, while “fragmentation-type” patches thrived in lowlands under agricultural/urban pressures. MGWR analysis identified slope, elevation, and the Grain for Green Program as key positive drivers of ELR connectivity, while urbanization and agricultural expansion emerged as dominant ELD fragmentation forces with pronounced spatial heterogeneity. XGBoost-SHAP further revealed nonlinear interactions: road density (>0.5 km/km2) exacerbating fragmentation in depopulating peri-urban zones, and climate-topography thresholds shaping restoration efficacy (e.g., precipitation > 1,300 mm). This national-scale assessment highlights the need for connectivity-oriented strategies: prioritize contiguous forest expansion in plains, promote infilling-type restoration in hills/mountains, and facilitate passive recovery in high-altitude regions. By quantifying patch-scale connectivity changes and disentangling complex driver interactions, the study provides a scientific foundation for adaptive forest management, bridging ecological conservation and socioeconomic development."

 The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential parameter for assessing vegetation growth. LAI derived from optical data can suffer from gaps caused by cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) presents a solution with its all-weather observation capability. To address these issues, this study proposes a new deep learning approach for reconstructing time series LAI using SAR and optical data in two steps. Firstly, the two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer (2D CNN-Transformer) is applied to bridge SAR and optical data. Secondly, the 2D CNN-Transformer predicted LAI and the Sentinel-2 LAI are input into the Enhanced Deep Convolutional Model for Spatiotemporal Image Fusion (EDCSTFN) model to further improve the accuracy. The novelty lies in a two-step framework combining a 2D CNN-Transformer for spatiotemporal feature extraction and a deep learning fusion algorithm refining accurate LAI reconstruction. Results showed that the 2D CNN-Transformer achieved a higher accuracy (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.38 m2/m2) in establishing a relationship between SAR and optical data, compared to 1D CNN, 2D CNN-LSTM, and 1D CNN-Transformer.

Given the complexity and heterogeneity of urban land cover, pixel-scale analyses often fail to accurately capture the thermal effects of impervious surfaces. To address this issue, we propose a universal impervious surface percentage (UISP) model based on Landsat imagery for subpixel-scale impervious surfaces monitoring. We evaluated the relationship between impervious surface percentage (ISP) and surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in four representative Chinese cities—Beijing, Kunming, Shenzhen, and Wuhan—from 2018 to 2023. Results indicate that UISP significantly improves the accuracy of impervious surface estimation over heterogeneous urban landscapes. The deviations of estimated ISP are as much as 0.2 lower than pixel-scale results. In SUHI areas, ISP values exceeded 0.4 to 0.6 higher than in non-SUHI regions. The ISP difference between SUHI levels 1 and 2 was 0.12, and between levels 5 and 6, it was 0.08, suggesting ISP saturation in high SUHI zones. This study introduced UISP for subpixel extraction of impervious surfaces and thermal environment analysis, offering a novel approach for precise quantification of urbanization and insights into thermal environment research."

 Continuous winter cover on croplands reduces soil erosion and enhances soil organic carbon, making it essential for climate-smart agriculture and greenhouse gas mitigation. However, spatially and temporally explicit data on winter cropland cover remain limited across Europe. We present a national-scale assessment of winter cropland cover in Germany from 2017 to 2023 using spectral unmixing-derived fractional cover time series from Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. Four winter cover types were distinguished: winter crops, green cover (including cover crops and spontaneous vegetation), residue cover, and no cover (bare soil). Phenological metrics were derived for green cover to assess vegetation duration, biomass accumulation, and termination type.Our results reveal an increasing share of green cover, rising from 17 % in 2017/18 to 21 % in 2022/23, and a decline in bare soil from 20 % to 12 %, indicating a shift toward more protective winter management. Green cover was most frequent in northwestern and southern Germany, while bare soil remained prevalent in central and eastern regions. Classification results showed good agreement with Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) parcel-level records of winter cover crops (F1-Score = 0.68) and agricultural census data at the federal state level (R2 = 0.82, MAE = 5 percentage points). Remote sensing estimates consistently exceeded reported cover crop shares, reflecting the presence of non-subsidized or spontaneous vegetation. Our approach provides valuable input for enhanced erosion and carbon modeling and establishes a basis for monitoring and future evaluation of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) instruments, including Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) standards."

 Rock glaciers are debris landforms formed by long-term creep of ice-rich permafrost. Their kinematics provide critical insights for climate change and permafrost studies, mountain hydrology, and hazard assessment. Previous studies have measured rock glacier velocities using field-based terrestrial geodetic surveys, repeat photogrammetry, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). However, these methods have typically been confined to local regions, leaving the large-scale velocity characteristics underexplored. In this study, we developed a multi-temporal and multi-geometry InSAR framework for systematically generating rock glacier velocity fields. We rigorously validated our approach by comparing the InSAR-derived velocities with those derived from very-high-resolution optical imagery (Pléiades satellite imagery and aerial imagery) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. The mean relative difference is approximately 20 % when compared to velocities from Pléiades and aerial images, increasing to 50 % for GNSS point measurements. Applying our method, we produced the first large-scale regional rock glacier velocity dataset, encompassing downslope velocity fields for 19,727 previously inventoried rock glaciers in the Tibet-Pamir-Karakoram region. We found a velocity contrast between different climatic domains: rock glaciers in the westerlies domain move on average faster (median = 30 cm/yr) than those in the monsoon domain (median = 13 cm/yr). Our study presents a methodological framework for assessing rock glacier velocities using InSAR and demonstrates its capability for large-scale applications. This approach can be readily adapted to other regions worldwide to support the assessment and monitoring of rock glacier dynamics in a changing climate."

 Delineating clear scene boundaries in remote sensing images remains a challenge despite their ability to visually present landscapes. This study introduces a novel Scene Boundary Visual Perception (SBVP) method designed to identify scene boundaries in remote sensing images that conform to human visual perception. SBVP first computes the image’s average state as a fundamental unit for perception, guiding upscaling segmentation for initial scene targets and superpixel segmentation for object-level refinement. The hypothesis that the average state of the image scene can effectively guide upscaling segmentation and superpixel segmentation was tested on 16 large-scale remote sensing images with varying spatial resolutions and land cover types. SBVP was compared against eCognition and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and further applied to suspicious target detection and the delineation of arid-humid and global biogeographical boundaries. Experimental results validate the hypothesis, showing that SBVP outperforms eCognition and SAM, achieving a mean IoU of 0.90, representing a 20 % and 23 % improvement over eCognition and SAM, respectively (P < 0.01). Additionally, SBVP effectively detects suspicious targets and enhances the delineation of arid-humid and global biogeographical boundaries.

In this study, we combined hourly PhenoCam pictures and time series Sentinel-2 images and identified the unique white feature in the cotton open-boll period from spectroscopy analysis.

Based on the stratified random sampling ground references, the open-boll cotton field map had a high overall accuracy of 95 % (± 1 %). The starting dates of the open-boll period varied across the southeastern United States, mainly ranging from the day of the year (DOY) 244 to 304 (September and October).

 Alpine zones, located above the treeline in high mountain areas, are highly sensitive to global warming. Topography modulates land surface energy, mass and momentum fluxes and thus can largely influence vegetation growth under a warming climate. However, little is known about the topographical effects on vegetation changes during recent decades, especially in alpine vegetation at the global scale. Here we utilize 30 m spatial resolution Landsat imagery to quantify trends in vegetation greenness and vegetated areas during 1984–2023 in global alpine ecosystems and quantify the effects of topography on vegetation changes. Our results reveal that more than 99 % of the global alpine zones show concurrent significant (p < 0.05) vegetation greening and increasing vegetated areas. Yet, the effects of topography on the two vegetation metrics diverge in 85.49 % of the regions where the magnitude of the rate of vegetation greening decreases with higher elevation whereas the expansion rate of vegetated areas is faster with higher elevations. Moreover, vegetation dynamics also covary with the slope aspect, with polar-facing slopes experiencing higher trend magnitude in vegetation greenness (72.59 %) and vegetated areas (64.50 %) compared to the equatorial-facing slopes. Our findings provide a unified assessment of global alpine vegetation dynamics and highlight the complex impacts of topographic factors on alpine ecosystems under global climate change."

 Landsat series data (Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Landsat-9 OLI2) hold significant potential for detecting temporal changes of underwater terrain in optically shallow waters resulting from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, waves, and human activities due to their extensive time series (nearly 40 years) and medium-spatial-resolution (30 m). However, different Landsat series images have different band sets and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) which may impact the consistency of the bathymetry inversion results of optimization-based bathymetry inversion models. Therefore, this study initially quantitatively evaluated the consistency of Landsat series data-derived bathymetry data over the South China Sea, which has a notable distribution of coral islands. The results of 12 images indicated that the root mean square error values of the estimated water depth are generally less than 4 m at Qilian Yu and less than 2 m at Dongsha Dao at depths shallower than 10 m. At depths greater than 10 m, OLI/OLI2 obtained higher accuracy in water depth inversion than did TM/ETM+. The inter-comparison results and temporal results of different geomorphic zones indicated that the Landsat series-derived water depth values in the reef flat and shallow lagoon, where water depth is shallower than 10 m, exhibit high consistency. However, because TM and ETM+ have lower SNRs, for deep lagoons and fore reefs where water depth is greater than 10 m and the substrate is dark, the OLI/OLI2- and TM/ETM+-derived water depth values substantially differ. Then, Landsat series data were applied to detect bathymetric changes in the Nanwei Dao. The temporal results of Nanwei Dao show that the depth of the new port has increased from approximately 2.00 to 10.00 m, whereas the new land in the northeast region has changed from a depth of approximately 7.50 m to land. To date, approximately 584252.74 ± 228884.43 m3 of sediment has been excavated in the port area of Nanwei Dao, with 1010657.21 ± 897737.97 m3 of land reclaimed from the water. Overall, the Landsat series data can be used to detect temporal changes in the underwater terrain of coral islands in the range of approximately 0 to 10 m over the South China Sea for nearly 40 years, and achieving reliable 40-year long-term monitoring of water depths exceeding 10 m remains challenging."

 Continuous low-intensity tillage is promoted as a sustainable farming practice; however, a single year of high-intensity tillage can significantly diminish its environmental and agronomic benefits. Monitoring these tillage dynamics requires accurate spatial and temporal data, and satellite observations offer a valuable tool for this purpose. However, their accuracy varies, and the role of ground datasets in improving that accuracy is not well-characterized.

Annually, 4,269 ha (16 %) disadopted low-intensity tillage, but this was offset by an increase in adoption, with fields totaling 5,878 ha under low-intensity tillage in 2022 that had been under high-intensity tillage in 2011. The second component tested the ability of remote sensing to align with this detailed, human-labeled survey of tillage intensity. We extracted 14 spectral indices from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2, texture metrics from the Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and environmental factors from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and SSURGO soil dataset.

 Geospatial modeling aims to integrate multiple geospatial data sources and geoprocessing functions based on user application demands to address complex geospatial challenges. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in semantic understanding and task planning, their limited geospatial domain knowledge still hinders their efficiency in geospatial modeling. Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate geospatial knowledge with the inherent semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs, enabling their effective application in specialized geospatial domains.

Specifically, GeoGraphRAG utilizes LLMs as intelligent agents to identify user demands, retrieve relevant subgraphs from external graph knowledge base, and injects both structural and semantic information into the LLM. Through the graph-driven solution planning phase, GeoGraphRAG automatically generates modeling solutions and geospatial code in response to specific user demands. The proposed method is evaluated against different baseline approaches across various LLMs based on the benchmark dataset designed for geospatial modeling, and a representative application scenario is presented to illustrate its practical effectiveness. Our experimental results demonstrate that the injection of graph-structured knowledge improves both the efficiency and interpretability of LLM-based geospatial modeling, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

 Due to its high population density and extensive commercial activity, traffic emissions are the primary source of anthropogenic pollutants in Hong Kong, significantly contributing to ozone (O3) pollution. This study examined the impact of traffic emissions from ships, vehicles, and aircraft on O3 levels in Hong Kong using the WRF-Chem model. Currently, traffic sources accounted for about 60 % of NOx and 40 % of VOCs — the key precursors to O3 formation in Hong Kong. During the daytime, eliminating traffic emissions led to a reduction in O3 concentration as a result of decreased photochemical production. However, at night, O3 concentrations increased due to weakened NOx titration. On average, the effect of reducing traffic emissions on O3 levels in Hong Kong varied depending on both the quantity and the ratio of NOx to VOCs. Among the traffic sources, ships were significant contributors, responsible for 35 % of NOx and 15 % of VOCs. Eliminating ship emissions shifted Hong Kong from a VOC-limited regime to a transitional regime, resulting in a 0.6 % decrease in O3 concentration. Conversely, when the NOx to VOCs ratio was low, as with vehicles (21 % NOx and 19 % VOCs), or when both NOx and VOCs emissions were minimal, as with aircraft (6 % NOx and 2 % VOCs), Hong Kong remained in a VOC-limited regime, and removing these emissions led to a 0.2 % increase in O3 concentration. Furthermore, significant changes in O3 concentrations typically occurred downwind of the emission centers under prevailing northeasterly winds.

 Concentration and sources of PM2.5 components especially black carbon (BC) in Beijing have changed significantly in recent years under the influence of numerous air pollution prevention and control policies. To evaluate the influence of control policies as well as the long-term variation of BC sources, hourly time-resolution BC measurements, with simultaneous measurements of multiple chemical species of PM2.5, were performed continuously from 2016 to 2019 in Beijing. Here, six major sources of BC including aged BC were resolved by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) with BC and other 18 species of PM2.5. The aged BC source resolved by PMF was validated by BC data from single-particle soot photometer (SP2) and single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS) for the first time in Beijing. The results showed that BC concentration decreased significantly from 2016 to 2019 with approximately 46 % of the decrease attributed to coal burning reduction. The sources of BC apportioned by PMF were compared to the emission inventory of BC and the best correlation was found between coal BC from PMF and residential BC from emission inventory. However, the contribution of traffic BC (from 40 % to 53 %) and aged BC (from 12 % to 15 %) increased during the study period. The major source of BC pollution episodes has shifted from coal combustion to traffic source. This study provided observation-based evidence for the effectiveness of air pollution control policies on BC, and provided guidance for future BC source control in Beijing."

 Long-term observation at different environmental sites is crucial for accurately tracking PM2.5 trends and formulating effective pollution control strategies. This study conducted PM2.5 sampling and component analysis at urban and suburban sites in Shenzhen in 2014, 2019, and 2024, using machine learning models to assess the impact of meteorological and source emission changes on PM2.5 trends and receptor model to identify PM2.5 sources. The results show that Shenzhen's PM2.5 levels declined by 47 % from 2014 to 2024, mostly due to long-term emission cuts, with meteorological impacts accounting for a minor 11.9 % of the change. Urban PM2.5 concentrations consistently surpass suburban ones, with both experiencing approximately 30 % declines in Phase I (2014–2019), whereas in Phase II (2019–2024), the urban site shows a greater 29 % drop compared with a 17 % drop at the suburban site, narrowing their gap. The source apportionment results show that in Phase I, the urban site's PM2.5 decline stemmed mainly from reduced vehicle emissions and secondary sulfate, while the suburban site's drop resulted from decreased secondary sulfate, ship emissions, and secondary organic aerosols. In Phase II, fugitive dust reduction is the primary driver of PM2.5 declines at both sites, though other sources also play a contributing role. Emission reductions from sources in Phase II are smaller than those in Phase I, coupled with a narrowed concentration gap between the two sites and a rising relative contribution from secondary sources, highlighting Shenzhen's need for stronger regional coordination and secondary pollutant control to lower PM2.5 levels."

 Although the association between PM2.5 and anemia is biologically plausible, involving the iron regulation disruption by chronic systemic inflammation following particle exposure, existing epidemiological evidence is limited, especially among workers or considering particle components.We selected 372,290 workers in Guangdong Province in 2020 and used the yearly PM2.5 concentrations and its chemical components’ annual concentrations around their workplaces as the exposure. We employed the use of mixed-effects models to assess the associations of PM2.5 and its components with hemoglobin and anemia, further investigating the interaction between stratified variables (demographic characteristics and occupational variables) and the five components on anemia.For each interquartile range increase in the concentration of PM2.5 and its components (BC, NH4+, NO3-, SO42-, OM), the hemoglobin concentration decreased by 0.993 (95 %CI: 0.927, 1.059), 0.747 (0.681, 0.812), 0.939 (0.871, 1.007), 1.237 (1.167, 1.306), 0.982 (0.916, 1.047), and 0.798 (0.735, 0.862) g/L, respectively. Except for BC, PM2.5 and the other components were associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of anemia, with ORs ranging from 3.0 % to 14.8 % per IQR increase in the exposure. NO3- had the most significant effect on both outcomes. In addition, we found that interactions between stratifying variables and concentrations of the five components were predominantly significant for the prevalence of anemia (P for interaction <0.05), with different susceptibilities observed across age groups, genders, and subgroups of occupational variables.The study offers an in-depth examination of the potential impact of PM2.5 and its components on the prevalence of anemia among workers."

 Triplet excited states (3C∗) of organic compounds and singlet oxygen (1O2) are important oxidants in the atmospheric aqueous phase, yet their roles in the degradation of phenolic compounds (PhCs) remain poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the aqueous-phase photochemical reactivity of five substituted phenols-eugenol, 4-ethylphenol (4-EP), 3-methylcatechol (3-MC), 4-nitrocatechol(4-NC) and 2,6-dimethoxy-4-methylphenol (DMMP)-in the presence of four triplet-state photosensitizers: 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (DMB), benzophenone (BP), vanillin (VA), and 2-acetonaphthone (2AN). The contributions of reactive oxidative species (ROS), including 1O2, •OH, and 3C∗ were systematically examined using quenching and chemical prober technique. The second-order rate constants (kPhCs,3C∗)for reactions between PhCs and 3DMB∗ ranged from (1–6)✕109 M−1 s−1, following the reactivity order: 4-NC > DMMP > EUG>4-EP>3-MC. However, no consistent reactivity trend was observed across different triplet sensitizers, indicating that different triplet-state photosensitizer exhibit varying reactivity toward phenolic compounds. Contribution analysis confirmed that 3C∗ was the dominant oxidant, accounting for 60–89 % of the observed photodegradation. The steady-state concentrations of 3C∗ and 1O2 were estimated as [3C∗]ss=(5.6–9.6) × 10−14 M and [1O2]ss (1.3–3.4) × 10−13 M, respectively. The quantum yield coefficient (fTMP) of 3C∗ ranged from 90 to 3000 M−1, while the 1O2 quantum yield (Φ1O2) varied between 1 % and 50 %. A strong correlation between fTMP and Φ1O2 suggested that 1O2 is primarily produced via energy transfer from 3C∗.Quantitative structure–activity relationship model showed a moderate correlation between kPhCs,3C∗ and oxidation potentials of PhCs (r2 = 0.34–0.72), while Hammett plots revealed stronger correlation with substituent constants(r2 = 0.61–0.93), highlighting the dominant influence of electronic effects of substituents. Increased substituent numbers appeared to suppress the reactivity of PhCs toward 3C∗, suggesting a combination of steric and electronic inhibition. These results provide new insight into the 3C∗-mediated degradation mechanisms of phenolic compounds in atmospheric aqueous-phase."

 Atmospheric amines have gained significant attention for their role in new particle formation, nitrogen cycling, and climate change. To investigate their formation mechanisms and sources, year-round PM2.5 samples were collected in Xiamen, a coastal city in southeastern China. Samples were analyzed for methylamine (MA), ethylamine (EA), and dimethylamine (DMA) using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Total measured amine concentrations were higher in spring and winter than in summer and autumn, with an annual average of 24.9 ng m−3, dominated by MA (40.1 %). The dominant formation pathway of particle-phase amines varied seasonally. In summer and autumn, a strong correlation between amines and acidic ions highlighted the importance of acid-base chemistry in amine salt formation. Conversely, increased relative humidity (RH) and enhanced aerosol acidity in spring and winter favored direct dissolution. While atmospheric oxidation generally enhanced the gas-to-particle conversion of amines, evidence of amine degradation by oxidants was also observed in spring. Five sources of amines were identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF): biomass burning, secondary products, industrial emissions, coal combustion and agricultural emissions, and marine and dust emissions. During summer, autumn, and spring, secondary products were the primary contributors to amines, accounting for nearly or over half. However, in winter, combustion sources played a larger role. Although the dominant sources varied by season and episode during different high concentration episodes, combustion activities and secondary formation were generally identified as the major contributors. Backward trajectory analysis showed that pollutant transport from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions significantly influenced amine levels in Xiamen. The PRD region showed substantial contributions from biomass burning and secondary products, whereas the YRD region was mainly linked to industrial emissions as well as coal combustion and agricultural emissions. These findings improve understanding of amine processes, offering valuable insights for targeted emission control strategies."

 BackgroundAlthough the link between air pollution and lung cancer is well established, recent evidence from low-pollution areas is mixed. We investigated the association of long-term exposure to air pollution with lung cancer incidence in Denmark.MethodsWe analyzed data from 28,731 female nurses in the Danish Nurse Cohort, followed from 1993/1999 until 2020 for lung cancer incidence. We estimated residential annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), and ozone (O3) using the DEHM/UBM/AirGIS modelling system. Time-varying Cox regression models evaluated the associations between these exposures and lung cancer incidence.ResultsAfter excluding participants who did not meet the criteria for our study, we were left with 23,706 participants, 450 of whom developed lung cancer during the study period.

Our study found no association between the pollutants investigated and lung cancer incidence. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals for lung cancer incidence associated with 5-year moving average exposures to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, BC, and O3 were 0.95 (0.75–1.20) per 2.68 μg/m3, 0.93 (0.78–1.12) per 2.81 μg/m3, 0.95 (0.83–1.08) per 7.98 μg/m3, 0.96 (0.86–1.08) per 0.34 μg/m3, and 1.05 (0.90–1.21) per 7.04 μg/m3, respectively, in the fully adjusted model.

 To quantitatively characterize atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in a key agricultural region, dry and bulk N deposition were measured at five sites (Fuzhou, Taining, Shanghang, Changting, and Wuyishan), in Fujian province of southeastern China over the past decade. Dry deposition of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was estimated using the influential method, multiplying gaseous N concentrations by the deposition velocity simulated using the GEOS-Chem model. For bulk deposition the amounts of NH4+-N and NO3−-N were obtained by multiplying the N concentrations in rainwater by the precipitation amount. Long-term in situ observations (from 2010 to 2020) indicated that bulk N deposition decreased by 17.4 % during the monitoring period. Notably, from 2016 to 2020, total N deposition significantly decreased by 22.2 %, with an average value of 27.5 ± 1.23 kg N ha−1 yr−1. This was mostly caused by a reduction in reduced N deposition. N deposition exhibited distinct seasonal variability, determined by the amount of precipitation: dry deposition reached its peak in autumn, whereas bulk deposition was at its highest in spring and summer. The ratios of reduced to oxidized N in dry deposition, bulk deposition, and total N deposition were 3.23, 1.03, and 1.39, respectively, indicating a strong influence of agricultural sources. Our results show that atmospheric N deposition is a significant source of N to cropland and surrounding forest ecosystems in Fujian province.

 Fresno, California, has some of the worst air quality in the United States, with PM2.5 exposure contributing to increased asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits. This study assesses the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and asthma ED visits in Fresno from 2005 to 2015, with a focus on vulnerable populations, including children, racial minorities, and those living in commercial areas. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to analyze the impact of PM2.5 on asthma ED visits. Data on ED visits were sourced from California's Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), and air pollution data from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS). Statistical models were adjusted for meteorological variables and additional pollutants (NO2, CO, and SO2). The study identified 7778 asthma-related ED visits. PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with an increase in ED visits (Lag 0–14, OR = 1.135) during the cold season (November–February) when concentrations of PM2.5 were the highest. Stratified analyses showed elevated risks for individuals in commercial areas, females, and Hispanic and Black populations. Children aged 2–5 years were particularly vulnerable, while older adults showed lower sensitivity. The dose responses analysis found that PM2.5 exposure of 9 μg/m3 or higher for a 14 day period significantly increased the risk of asthma-related ED visits during the cold season. PM2.5 exposure during the cold season significantly increases asthma ED visits, particularly among vulnerable populations that live in commercial areas. These findings highlight the need for targeted public health measures to mitigate the effects of PM2.5 in high-risk communities."

 Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), a key secondary pollutant, plays a vital role in atmospheric chemistry and photochemical smog formation. In this study, PAN concentrations were measured at an urban site during the peak photochemical pollution period in June 2022. The study examined PAN's production, loss processes, regional transport, and sensitivity to precursors within the context of photochemical pollution events. Two distinct photochemical pollution episodes were identified, with average PAN concentrations of 1.4 ± 0.7 ppbv and 0.9 ± 0.5 ppbv in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively, both exceeding those on clean days (0.8 ± 0.4 ppbv). The diurnal variation of PAN exhibited a typical unimodal pattern, indicating enhanced photochemical activity during pollution episodes. Conditional probability analysis revealed that peak concentrations of ozone (O3) and PAN predominantly originated from the north-to-east sector, whereas nitrous acid maxima occurred near the observation site under low wind speeds. PAN thermal decomposition was more pronounced on clean days, resulting in a shorter atmospheric lifetime compared to pollution events. Observation-based model simulations further demonstrated that PAN production and loss rates were significantly higher during pollution episodes than on clean days. Temperature emerged as a key factor driving PAN's diurnal pattern. Additionally, relative incremental reactivity analysis indicated that PAN formation was highly sensitive to anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly alkenes. This study provides valuable insights into PAN behavior under severe photochemical pollution conditions, contributing to a better understanding of urban air quality and photochemical smog formation mechanisms."

This study investigates long-term hospital utilisation following the Hazelwood mine fire (Feb–March 2014), in a cohort of children exposed during infancy.MethodsBirth records of all children born in the Latrobe Valley, Australia, and aged under two during the fire (n = 1788), were linked to emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions for a five-year period immediately following the event. Associations between modelled terciles of fire-specific particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and presentations/admissions, for all causes as well as for specific diagnostic groupings (respiratory, infectious, allergic), were assessed using a recurrent events survival analysis approach.ResultsChildren with medium (HR 1.16, 95 %CI 1.06–1.28) or high exposure (HR 1.11, 95 %CI 1.01–1.21) had higher rates of overall presentations to the ED than those with low exposure. Children with medium exposure still had marginally higher rates of presentation to the ED, after exclusion of diagnoses unlikely to have a clinical connection to smoke (HR 1.13, 95 %CI 1.00–1.27).ConclusionsWe observed an increase during a five-year period in overall ED presentations in children with higher exposure to smoke during infancy, although these results were attenuated after adjusting for the distance between the residential area and the hospital.

 The air quality in the Mediterranean coastal region is adversely affected by rising shipping emissions in the area. The present study demonstrates the results of an ensemble modelling approach for assessing the impact of shipping emissions on current and future air quality concentrations and exposure in the coastal Mediterranean region.Ensemble model means were calculated based on the results of three regional or global dispersion models (EMEP, SILAM and CMAQ) to simulate annual and seasonal atmospheric pollutant dispersion patterns in the Mediterranean region, under the baseline 2018 scenario and two 2050 future scenarios developed within the EMERGE (Evaluation, control and Mitigation of the EnviRonmental impacts of shippinG Emissions) project. The selected scenarios examine the impact of a) the designation of a Mediterranean Sulfur/Nitrogen Emission Control Area (SECA/NECA) and the extensive use of open-loop scrubbers, Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems and Selective Catalytic Reduction systems on future shipping emissions (Scenario 3 - S3) and b) the increased use of methane and methanol as alternative fuels in 2050 (Scenario 8 - S8).Ensemble model results were combined with population data for calculating population-weighted concentrations of legislated atmospheric pollutants for 30 Mediterranean coastal cities, representing exposure of city inhabitants to current and predicted future air pollution levels.The findings of the present study reveal significant annual city average reductions of SO2 and PM2.5 shipping related exposure for both S3 (89.78 % reduction) and S8 (96.22 % reduction), while shipping induced NO2 city-average exposure levels were efficiently controlled in S3 (42.74 % reduction) but not in S8 (4.39 % reduction). The reported results need to be specifically considered in the development of policy recommendations on shipping emission control for the Mediterranean region."

This study presents a detailed examination of both biogenic and anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) tracers in the Greater Bay Area. The inclusion of a diverse suite of molecular markers in PMF analysis has enabled the identification of six secondary source factors, including specific SOA factors derived from various precursors, demonstrating superior source resolution compared to traditional methods. The study also compares SOA estimates from chamber-generated mass conversion factors with PMF results, highlighting qualitative consistencies and discrepancies between the two approaches that suggest further refinement in tracer-based methods.

 Ozone (O3) pollution is a critical environmental issue, especially in rapidly developing industrial regions such as Dushanzi, an oil and petrochemical hub in northwestern China. This paper investigated the first 4-day ozone pollution event in Dushanzi in June 2023. Meteorological parameters, O3 and its precursor concentrations were utilized, combined with the Observation-based model (OBM), Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), and backward trajectory analysis, to investigate the causes of ozone pollution in the region. The OBM-MCM model assesses the sensitivity of ozone and its generation-loss mechanisms, revealing that O3 is mainly generated through the HO2+NO pathway and lost via the NO2+RO2 pathway. On polluted days, the region falls into the VOCs-NOx collaborative control zone, with an optimal VOCs to NOx reduction ratio of 1:2. Under this reduction ratio, focusing on emissions reduction from the petrochemical industry, particularly controlling OVOCs, would be beneficial for reducing ozone pollution. Based on OFP and PMF analyses, petrochemical emissions were identified as the primary source of O3 pollution, with OVOCs contributing the most to O3 formation. Meteorological data revealed that high temperatures, low humidity and low wind speeds are external triggers of ozone pollution in the region. Meanwhile, the impact of long-range transport in the eastern Shihezi-Changji region cannot be ignored. This study provides important scientific basis for local governments to formulate O3 pollution control strategies."

 Biodegradation of small organics by bacteria in the atmosphere efficiently competes with chemical losses despite the low number concentration of metabolically active bacteria. We measured biodegradation rates of formaldehyde by three bacterial strains isolated from fog water (belonging to the genera Comamonas, Pseudomonas and Methylobacterium) as a function of pH (4.8–6.8), with invariably highest rates for each strain at the highest pH. We also investigated the potential impact of formaldehyde biodegradation in the presence of sulfite on hydroxymethanosulfonate (HMS), an adduct of formaldehyde and S(IV) frequently detected in fog and cloud water. Our observations show that HMS formation reduces the rate of formaldehyde biodegradation by acting as a formaldehyde reservoir. The newly determined biodegradation rates were incorporated into a state-of-the-art atmospheric multiphase chemistry box model that realistically considers a small fraction of fog droplets contain bacteria to simulate for the first time the effect of biodegradation on formaldehyde and HMS concentrations under typical conditions of night-time radiation fog. The model results suggest that biodegradation decreases the concentration of formaldehyde by ∼1 % and that of HMS <0.1 %, i.e., likely below detection thresholds needed to confidently attribute changes in aqueous phase concentrations to biodegradation. The loss by biodegradation may contribute as much to the total loss of aqueous phase formaldehyde as chemical reactions since during night-time also chemical losses are small. The discrepancies between high biodegradation rates measured in laboratory and the low impaction on atmospheric chemistry from modelling findings can be attributed to differences in timescales (72–84 h in the lab vs. ∼1-h fog droplet lifetimes) and oxidative conditions, which result in rapid S(IV) oxidation in fog, thus limiting HMS formation."

 Urban air quality is a major concern due to high population density and pollutant levels. To develop effective mitigation strategies, distinguishing between local and external emission sources is crucial. In Polish cities, residential heating is the primary source of particulate matter emissions, with transportation also playing a significant role.This study assesses the impact of the transport sector on Warsaw’s air quality by analysing PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations. A comprehensive approach was applied, integrating emissions from traffic, road dust resuspension, and residential heating. These emissions were estimated using a bottom-up approach based on detailed road and point source data. The ATMO-Street model chain was employed, combining the GEM-AQ model for background concentrations with the IFDM bi-Gaussian dispersion model and the OSPM street-canyon module. Model validation using data from nine monitoring stations demonstrated that including the OSPM module significantly improved NO2 predictions at the traffic station, enhancing GEM-AQ and IFDM model performance by 62% and 46%, respectively. The results showed that traffic contributes 84% of NO2 concentrations at this location.Furthermore, incorporating the street-canyon effect and resuspension emissions—previously excluded—improved model accuracy for PM2.5 and PM10 by 34% and 55%, respectively, compared to GEM-AQ. The study revealed that traffic contributes up to 41% of PM2.5 and 42% of PM10 at the traffic station. These findings underscore the importance of including road dust resuspension and street-canyon effects in urban air quality modelling."

 Source apportionment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) provides scientific basis for the prevention of ozone (O3) and particulate matter pollution, while bias exists in the receptor model based on the measured concentration. We conducted online measurement of hourly ambient concentrations for multiple VOCs species in January and July 2023 in Lianyungang, a city with fast growing industry in east China, and five major sources of VOCs were identified with an improved application of the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model by considering photochemical losses and formation potential of secondary aerosols (SOAP) and O3 (OFP). For January and July, the total VOCs (TVOC) concentrations were measured at 23.7 ± 10.8 and 12.0 ± 7.5 ppbv, and the averaged consumed VOCs due to photochemical losses in daytime reached 3.12 and 3.08 ppb, respectively. The concentrations were generally lower than those in Chinese mega cities. As the important emission from industrial sources, Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were found to occupy a significant position in the concentration structure of TVOCs and photochemical losses in Lianyungang. Inclusion of photochemical losses avoided underestimation of contribution from solvent usage and overestimation of vehicle emissions in summer. There was a significant difference between source contributions based on concentrations and environmental impacts (SOAP in winter and OFP in summer). For the latter, coal burning was identified as the most important source in January, and industrial emissions and solvent usage in July. Indicated by the backward trajectories, local emissions were the dominant contributor to the VOCs pollution, mainly from the large ports and industrial parks, while industrial emissions from nearby provinces (Shandong and Anhui) were also important. The analyses provide scientific evidences for determining the priorities of VOCs emission controls for cities with fast industrialization."

 Residential solid fuel combustion is a significant contributor to air pollution in Hungary, particularly in rural areas. This study aimed to assess air pollution attributable to residential solid combustion by monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of PM2.5 mass concentration and other specific air pollutants. Sampling campaigns were conducted at rural and urban sites with differing heating habits, comparing heating and non-heating periods in 2020.Significant differences in air pollutant concentrations were observed between the two periods. At the rural site, the mean PM2.5 mass concentration was 1.7 times higher during the heating period compared to the urban site. Biomass burning markers (e.g. levoglucosan, potassium, organic carbon in PM2.5) showed a significant associations during the heating period. Additionally, the universal waste burning marker 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene was detected on 93% of the measurement days at the rural site during the heating period, indicating continuous waste burning. The results of 14C analysis and multiple diagnostic ratios further supported source identification. The annual target value for benzo(a)pyrene (1 ng/m3) was exceeded in 100% of samples collected at the rural site and 64% of samples at the urban site during the heating period.

 Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) emissions and depositions have been linked to negative effects on human health and biodiversity. National monitoring networks have documented large spatial variation of NH3 concentrations related to agricultural activities, including livestock pollution. Little is known about spatial and temporal variation of livestock-related ammonia concentrations in areas where residential and nature areas are located nearby intensive livestock farming. The objective of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal variability of ambient ammonia in such a mixed land-use area within the Netherlands.A dense air quality network was set up with 71 sites spanning over 1027 km2 within rural and semi-urban (small towns) areas, and nature reserves. Ambient ammonia concentrations were measured monthly with passive samplers from March 2022 to February 2024.Ammonia measurements showed large spatial and temporal variation. Spatial variation was related to the number of livestock farms in a 3000m buffer around sites and inverse distance to the nearest farm. Mean concentrations were 13.6 μg/m3 (rural), 9.6 μg/m3 (semi-urban) and 5.1 μg/m3 (nature sites). Seasonal patterns, highest in spring and lowest in winter, were similar in rural, semi-urban and natural sites. The highest concentrations were observed in March 2022, coinciding with manure application and stable weather conditions. Temporal variability related to temperature, rainfall, manure application, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity. Multivariate models explained 52–80 % of the temporal variance component, depending on time period. Our spatial and temporal analyses provide further evidence that farming emissions impact NH3 concentrations both locally and at greater distances."

 Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are generated through the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and constitute a significant fraction of atmospheric particulate matter. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are primarily derived from anthropogenic sources, undergo oxidation processes that generate less volatile products. These products subsequently partition into aerosol particles, thereby contributing to SOA formation. This review synthesizes key findings from laboratory investigations regarding SOA formation from oxidation of PAHs, outlining the reaction products and mechanisms under diverse oxidation conditions, as well as the factors influencing SOA yields. Radical adduct formation and H-atom abstraction are pivotal in reactions involving hydroxyl (OH) radicals, nitrate (NO3) radicals, chlorine (Cl) atoms, and ozonolysis. SOA yields are notably affected by the conditions of photooxidation and the characteristics of the precursor compounds. Additionally, the review offers insights into the human effects and the mechanisms of cellular toxicity associated with SOA derived from naphthalene. Overall, this review elucidates the role of PAHs in SOA formation and provides critical information for the modulation of PAH-SOA to mitigate air pollution."

 From July 17 to 22, 2021, Zhengzhou City and its surrounding areas in Henan Province, China, experienced the strongest precipitation event since the inception of modern meteorological records in the country. Using daily precipitation data from China Meteorological Administration stations spanning 1951–2024 and daily gridded reanalysis data from ERA5 over 1979–2024, we investigated the relationship between zonal baroclinic Rossby wave packets (RWPs) and this extreme heavy precipitation event in Zhengzhou. The results demonstrated that during the extreme precipitation event in Zhengzhou, no noticeable cyclone but cyclonic curvature of streamlines was observed at 850 hPa, while a “moisture tongue” provided rich water vapor necessary for the intense rainfall. The activities of the zonally baroclinic RWPs were closely linked to the onset and cessation of the heavy precipitation. Throughout the period of the extreme precipitation event, there consistently exhibited more pronounced daily activities of Rossby waves with wavenumbers 5–7 in the Eastern Hemisphere as compared to those in the Western Hemisphere. The RWPs influencing the extreme event originated in the upper atmosphere from Western Europe and propagated to the Zhengzhou area over a period of approximately five days.

 Coking industries are an important source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Coking emissions are characterized by diverse emission points, species and intensities, leading to inconsistencies in emission profiles. This complexity complicates the accurate identification of coking-related pollutants in the atmosphere. To obtain a distinct VOC fingerprint from coking emissions, 57 VOCs were detected based on a comprehensive sampling campaign conducted at three strategically placed sites (one in an area with intensive coking activity and two downwind sites) and one control site. We found a positive correlation between the contribution of coking emissions to total VOCs (TVOCs) (between 10.4 % and 44.2 %) and the severity of VOC pollution (TVOC content ranging from 28.75 to 49.28 ppbv). Furthermore, increases in the contribution of coking emissions to TVOC content resulted in increases in the proportions of alkenes (from 10 % to 19 % in summer and 13 % to 20 % in autumn) and aromatics (from 6 % to 18 % in autumn) in TVOCs. Ethane, ethene, propene, benzene, toluene, and acetylene were identified as dominant VOC species in coking emissions. Their concentrations increased as coking activity increased and were highly prevalent in the coking source profile, as indicated by positive matrix factorization analysis. The ratio of benzene to toluene, alongside the relative proportions of benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene and of ethane, propane, and ethene was effective diagnostic indicators for identifying coking sources. The PMF-resolved factor profile from our field campaign could accurately represent coking emissions. Photochemical aging led to an underestimation of the coking-source contribution but had little effect on the ranges of the diagnostic indicators or the chemical profile of VOCs from coking sources."

 This study examines the modeling uncertainty of wind resource data stemming from the use of various planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations available in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF-based wind simulations spanning 20 years at 3-km resolution using 11 different PBL schemes are used to objectively investigate the uncertainty in modeling wind speed for land-based wind (LBW) and offshore wind (OSW) locations in Puerto Rico. The uncertainty in the wind modeling for the 20-year dataset is quantified using the spread index (SI) and standard deviation (SD). For virtual LBW and OSW sites, the SI and SD values are analyzed as calculated across various spatial and temporal scales. Because the PBL's atmospheric stability conditions can be characterized into two dominant categories, the study focuses on analyzing the SI and SD for daytime (mainly unstable PBL conditions) and nighttime (mainly stable PBL conditions). For wind shear (10 m–200 m) at the OSW and LBW sites, WRF-based numerical experiments indicate the following SI (or SD) ranges: 39 %–94 % (0.74 m/s–1.44 m/s) during the daytime for OSW, 50 %–75 % (0.68 m/s–1.19 m/s) during the daytime for LBW, 37 %–60 % (0.73 m/s–1.12 m/s) during the nighttime for OSW, and 57 %–143 % (0.65 m/s–1.43 m/s) during the nighttime for LBW.

 The Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) is one of the most important regions with rapid urbanization in China. The research employs the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to investigate the influences of urbanization on precipitation patterns and intensities of predecessor rain events (PREs) induced by Typhoon Khanun (2017) in the YRD. The results indicate that using land use data during the precipitation event can improve the model simulation performance. Although the total regional precipitation remains relatively unchanged, urbanization significantly alters the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall, resulting in enhanced precipitation in the coastal urban regions near the heavy precipitation center regions, with a maximum increase up to 52 %. In contrast, rainfall near the inland outer region of the heavy precipitation center is reduced, with a maximum decrease up to 50 %, exhibiting a prominently uneven distribution pattern, which requires adaptive zoning in flood management. Mechanistically, around the coastal urban regions near heavy precipitation centers, urbanization enhances water vapor convergence and atmospheric instability, necessitating revised stormwater infrastructure design standards for these high-risk zones; while it suppresses water vapor transport, enhancing atmospheric stability in the inland outer region. Further analysis of the cloud microphysics reveals that urbanization significantly strengthens the processes of raindrop accretion of cloud water and water vapor condensing into raindrops, thereby promoting increased rainfall in the coastal urban region; in contrast, it may weaken the processes of snow melting and water vapor condensing into raindrops, leading to reduced precipitation in the peripheral inland outer region. These findings offer scientific support for climate-resilient urban planning, demonstrating how urbanization shifts precipitation patterns, necessitating coordinated regional adaptation for flood resilience."

 Polar regions exhibit distinctive irradiance characteristics driven by their high-latitude location, yet these features have been scarcely investigated. In this study, we present and analyze surface irradiance measurements from two sites around Longyearbyen (78.2° N) in Svalbard: Adventdalen valley and Platåberget (456 m above sea level). The Adventdalen measurements span 10 years (2013−2022) of longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) horizontal irradiance, while SW irradiance measurements, both horizontal and tilted, cover the sunlight seasons of 2021 and 2022 at both sites. Key findings include unique irradiance features, such as downwelling SW irradiance is maximum in late May—earlier than the solstice—due to a relative low cloudiness and the snow involving an irradiance enhancement (terrain reflection and albedo enhancement). Upwelling SW irradiance, influenced by snow cover, peaks in early May but may shift with prolonged snow seasons. Albedo values from May 2012–2017 were lower than 2018–2022, suggesting earlier snowmelt and potential long-term impacts on upwelling SW irradiance. Comparatively, SW irradiance is generally higher on Platåberget, with snow cover differences leading to discrepancies in downwelling and upwelling SW irradiance, in part due to an irradiance enhancement with high albedo. The LW budget is consistently negative, averaging −34 W m−2 annually, while the SW budget drives the surface energy balance, becoming positive from late April to mid-September. These findings underscore the importance of in-situ measurements for understanding Arctic irradiance processes, which are crucial for advancing solar energy applications and climate research in polar regions."

 Extreme precipitation plays a critical role in the development of hydrological extremes with severe socio-economic and environmental impacts. Over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), extreme precipitation events have increased in frequency and intensity and are projected to rise further under climate change. However, simulations of such events in this region remain challenging due to uncertainties in the representation of cloud microphysics. While previous research has exposed the sensitivity of climate models to microphysics schemes, the atmospheric processes driving discrepancies in precipitation simulations are still not fully explored. In this study, we analyse two extreme precipitation events over the TP region using six different microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). We assess how precipitation and related processes are represented across these schemes and identify key sources of uncertainties in precipitation simulations. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the location, intensity and timing of precipitation, with differences in accumulated amounts reaching up to 40 % depending on the microphysics scheme used. Further analysis shows that the timing and strength of convective activity are closely linked to precipitation patterns, leading to significant discrepancies across experiments. Additionally, the representation of horizontal water vapour transport plays a critical role in determining the location and intensity of precipitation by influencing moisture availability. Lastly, the modelling of cloud composition – particularly of solid-phase hydrometeors – emerges as a crucial factor in precipitation evolution, contributing substantially to the variability in simulated precipitation location and intensity."

 The present study characterizes the pre-monsoon convective clouds (PMCC) observed in the monsoon core zone and a hail-producing storm during the pre-monsoon month observed using C-band dual-polarization (CDPR) radar at the IITM's Atmospheric Research Testbed (ART) facility in Silkheda, 60 km north of Bhopal. The composite analysis of PMCC has shown that the maximum height of 35- and 50-dBZ echo tops (ETHs) is around 13 km and 11 km, respectively, indicating intense and deep convection. The mean value of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is also high for the pre-monsoon season. The composite contoured-frequency-by-altitude diagrams (CFADs) of PMCC show a high frequency of smaller values of differential reflectivity (ZDR ∼ 0 dB) and specific differential phase (KDP) above the melting layer, indicating that intense convective updrafts dominate the PMCC, causing hail/graupel particles to be rimmed heavily above the melting layer and reach greater heights. The wider distribution or higher values of ZH, ZDR, KDP, and small values of correlation coefficient ρHV (<0.95) near the surface indicate the presence of a rain-hail mixture during the pre-monsoon month.The microphysical characteristic of a hailstorm event that produced hailstones over Bhopal on 30th April 2023 is explored. It is found that the CAPE value was building up before the hailstorm event, and it was high just before the hailstone was observed over Bhopal. Time evolution of storms indicates the dominant presence of graupel/hail at 5-11 km. Graupel/hail will form due to the riming or accretion processes of cloud droplets, supercooled water, or ice particles. It has been observed that the riming process is dominant during the storm's evolution, which produces very low values of ZDR and KDP. The high value of ρHV (>0.99) at these altitudes suggests that the graupel/hail is dry. The updraft associated with a convectively unstable atmosphere exaggerates the growth of ice crystals by a rapid collection of supercooled water droplets. That ultimately led to forming graupel/hailstones through the riming process. The wet hailstones and large raindrops signatures close to the surface are also observed and are characterized by higher values of ZH (> 50 dBZ), enhanced ZDR (∼ 3–4 dB), and a depleted ρHV (< 0.95). Additionally, a KDP exceeding 1.8°/km near the surface indicates the process of hail melting/hail coated with water."

 Deep moist convection significantly disturbs the evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) through its convective cold pools (CCPs). This study investigates the statistics of CCPs and their impact on PBL turbulence as observed at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) site. To obtain a large dataset of CCPs, we adapted an existing CCP-detection algorithm for use in multilevel, micrometeorological data. Application of the algorithm to ATTO observations collected from August 2021 through December 2023 resulted in a dataset consisting of 410 CCPs. CCPs occur nearly every other day at the ATTO site, although they are most common from April through September and are least common from December through March. The occurrence of CCPs is linked to the diurnal cycle of the PBL, with more events around 1800 UTC and the less events around 1100 UTC. The strength of CCP perturbations varies strongly as a function of the distance from the canopy. Above the canopy (approximately 37 m), CCPs exhibit well-defined gust fronts, marked by sharp drops in temperature and humidity, gusting winds, overturning circulations, and pressure rises. During gust front passages, sensible (latent) heat fluxes are briefly enhanced and subsequently invert sign (weaken) in the CCPs, as previously unstable (moister) PBLs become stable (drier). Turbulence is stronger and more anisotropic during gust fronts and just above the canopy due to mechanical drag. Anisotropic turbulence may be transported upward to 200 m by the gust fronts. Below the canopy, CCPs and attendant perturbations are drastically damped, except in high-end cases."

 Diurnal temperature range (DTR) is an important climate indicator that exerts substantial effects on society as well as the environment, particularly on karst landforms where the ecosystem is vulnerable and sensitive to DTR. However, the space-time pattern of extremes of DTR and their relationship with wind speed over global karst regions remain poorly understood. In this study, we defined DTR extremes and investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of warm-season extremes and their relationships with wind speeds across global karst regions during 1980–2022. Our results reveal that arid zones such as the Middle East and northwestern China exhibit large long-term mean DTR and DTR extremes. There is an increase in the frequency of DTR extremes for most regions, though pronounced regional divergence of DTR trends exists. The intensity of DTR extremes show apparent increasing trends in North America and Europe, but in other regions decreased trends are prevailing. For most regions worldwide, declining wind speed trends are discerned, though slight increases are observed in the western United States. Moreover, wind speed is generally strengthened along with larger DTR. Daytime DTR extremes dominate North America, Europe and south China, while nighttime extremes are likely to occur in the Middle East and Asia. These findings advance the understanding of DTR extremes in fragile karst ecosystems, which could help for region-specific climate adaptation strategies."

 The positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) acts as a key precursor to La Niña formation, yet the dynamical interactions between pIOD and concurrent El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases remain insufficiently understood. Through an analysis of reanalysis datasets and simulations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LENS), this study demonstrates that 64.2 % of observed pIOD events coincide with concurrent El Niño, aligning with a frequency of 57.1 % in CESM-LENS simulations. The probability of subsequent La Niña development following pIOD-El Niño coexistence reaches 54.7 % in reanalysis data and 59.0 % in CESM-LENS simulations, escalating to 75.6 % for intense pIOD episodes and 82.5 % under conditions of concurrent strong El Niño events. Spatiotemporal analysis reveals distinct transition mechanisms governed by Pacific background states. During periods of pIOD-El Niño coexistence, oceanic advection (51.7 %) works synergistically with surface heat flux (22.2 %) to collectively dissipate warm anomalies. In contrast, under pIOD-Neutral conditions, intensified zonal advection (61.7 %) predominantly facilitates cooling processes. Two key findings emerge from this analysis: (1) The intensity of the pIOD directly modulates both the likelihood and magnitude of subsequent La Niña, with stronger initial pIOD substantially enhance development probabilities; (2) Concurrent ENSO states determine the dominant physical drivers at play—El Niño coexistence enabling a multi-mechanism cooling while Neutral conditions necessitate accelerated advective processes. These findings demonstrate that combinations of pIOD-ENSO phases create distinct thermodynamic pathways for initiating La Niña events, carrying significant implications for seasonal forecasting. The identified intensity-dependent relationships and phase-specific mechanisms provide a framework for improving climate predictability, particularly under evolving climate conditions that may alter tropical basin interactions."

 The rainy season in South China is predominantly influenced by monsoon and tropical cyclone (TC) weather systems. However, due to the lack of long-term observational data, the microphysical characteristics of raindrop size distributions (DSDs) associated with these systems remain insufficiently understood. This study utilizes five years (2016–2020) of 2DVD observations to analyze the differences in DSD characteristics of monsoon and TC rainfall. The results indicate that monsoon rainfall exhibits higher concentrations of medium to large raindrops (diameter > 2.1 mm), along with larger mean rainfall rates (R) and mass-weighted mean diameters (Dm), but lower normalized intercept parameters (Nw) compared to TC rainfall. Distinct differences in the mean normalized DSDs are observed between monsoon and TC rainfall. Convective rain under both systems shows the characteristics of maritime convective rain. Additionally, the relationships between kinetic energy (KE) and R, KE and Dm, as well as radar reflectivity (Z) and R, differ between monsoon and TC rainfall. TC events have relatively humid atmospheric conditions and higher wind speeds, resulting in the presence of a large number of small raindrops.

 This paper presents a new three-dimensional (3D) adaptive lightning progressing stochastic model (ALPSM) that incorporates the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method to enable a compatible simulation of large-domain intracloud discharges and near-ground lightning leader attachment processes. A new self-consistent charge neutrality maintenance algorithm is proposed, which considers the internal electric field of the lightning channel and ensures synchronized adjustments of the channel potential with the ambient potential. The model successfully reproduces the reported leader connection scenarios during the negative cloud-to-ground (−CG) lightning attachment process and analyzes the spatiotemporal evolutionary process of leader propagation and channel potential variation. The simulation results reveal a series of interesting phenomena in leader propagation before grounding: initial bidirectional vertical propagation during channel potential rapidly adjusting from the initial value to the average of the positive and negative charge regions; horizontal multibranch propagation within charge regions where the most concentrated height of horizontal propagation corresponds to the vertical electric field zero-crossing points; and downward negative leader vertical propagation during the rapidly increasing channel potential period. The ALPSM model advances the lightning stochastic model simulation owing to the charge neutrality constraint and adaptive mesh refinement in large three-dimensional domains, which provides a further method for the lightning attachment process simulation."

 The assimilation of radar reflectivity plays a crucial role in improving the initial fields of numerical weather prediction (NWP). This study employs a one-dimensional (1D) Bayesian scheme to retrieve pseudo-humidity observations from radar reflectivity, which are subsequently assimilated within a three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) framework. The results demonstrate that under dry-biased background field, the joint assimilation of radial velocity and pseudo humidity observations more markedly enhances moisture condition compared to radial velocity assimilation alone, resulting in improved quantitative precipitation forecast skills. Additionally, a valid-time-shifting (VTS) method is implemented to augment a priori database in 1D Bayesian retrieval by introducing sub-ensembles before and after the analysis time, aiming to mitigate temporal and spatial displacement errors in the NWP system. Two assimilation experiments are conducted to evaluate the impact of the VTS scheme on severe convection prediction. It can be found that the VTS method improves consistency in thermodynamic and dynamic structures. The assessments of short-term precipitation forecasts confirm that the application of VTS scheme improves the prediction accuracy of precipitation intensity and spatial distribution."

America and N. Asia. •Humidex anomalies amplify ∼2.9× in JJA from SSP1–2.6 to SSP5–8.5. •Air temperature dominates Humidex rise; humidity plays a secondary role. 
 This study investigates future projections of the extreme Humidex, a compound index integrating air temperature and relative humidity, as an indicator of heat stress under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1–2.6 and SSP5–8.5). Using multi-model ensemble simulations from 15 high-resolution CMIP6 models, we examine seasonal variations in the extreme Humidex at both global and regional scales across 21 land regions. The historical simulations from CMIP6 models were validated using ERA5 observational data, ensuring reliability and accuracy in model projections. Additionally, the climatology of Humidex values derived from MME simulations was compared with the climatology of the Heat Index obtained from MME simulations, revealing consistency between the two heat stress indicators. To quantify heat-related hazards, we calculate the number of seasonal Dangerous Humidex Days (DHDs). Furthermore, we assess the relative contributions of air temperature and relative humidity to projected changes in the extreme Humidex. The results reveal a marked intensification of heat stress under SSP5–8.5, with late-century (2080–2100) increases in the extreme Humidex reaching approximately 5 to 9 °C across most land regions, compared to around 1.5 to 3.5 °C under SSP1–2.6. The JJA season exhibits the greatest intensification, particularly over Eastern North America and Northern Asia. On average, DJF shows a 2.78-fold increase in Humidex anomalies, while JJA demonstrates an even larger amplification of approximately 2.90-fold when transitioning from a low to high-emission scenario. The number of seasonal Dangerous Humidex Days also increases significantly, with an additional 60 to 80 days during DJF across many tropical and subtropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere, and more than 80 additional days per JJA season in most tropical regions under the high-emission scenario. Sensitivity analyses indicate that air temperature is the dominant driver of future changes in the extreme Humidex, while relative humidity exerts a secondary but regionally important influence."

 Evaluating the efficacy of cloud-seeding operations presents a complex challenge in atmospheric science, due to the multifaceted interactions between artificial nuclei, natural cloud processes, and local meteorological conditions. In this study, to assess cloud-seeding effects, several field experiments were conducted at Dongyanshan site (elevation 840 m) in northern Taiwan during northeast monsoon seasons from 2019 to 2022. The experiments utilized hygroscopic cloud seeding, leveraging the site's advantages of well-established instrumentation and a semi-closed, in-cloud environment. Our observational results indicate that the seeding agents can strengthen the competition effect, which causes an increase in liquid water content (LWC) and a decrease in water vapor mixing ratio, as well as the tail effect, which widens the drop size distribution (DSD). This important phenomenon of increased raindrop number concentration after cloud seeding was further confirmed by DSD observations at the upstream neighboring site, Xiayunping (elevation 340 m), where no cloud seeding was executed. Additionally, real-case model simulations were performed to further investigate the microphysical processes of cloud seeding. Simulation results indicate that cloud seeding enhances the cloud activation process (Pcact) while leading to the development of smaller cloud droplets, which decreases the auto-conversion process (Praut) of rain. Concurrently, an intensified accretion process (Pracw) increases raindrop diameter. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of cloud seeding, potentially improving the design and implementation of future weather modification strategies in similar atmospheric conditions."

 sUnderstanding the dynamic evolution of dry-wet transition events (DWTEs) at different time scales is significant in water resources planning, agricultural development, and disaster risk reduction in a changing climate. The   southeast coastal region of China has been identified as a hot spot; however, the evolution of DWTEs at different time scales is unclear. This study identified DWTEs in China's   southeast coastal region at monthly, seasonal, and semi-annual scales from 1961 to 2020 based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) over 30-, 90- and 180-day moving window, and the spatiotemporal evolution of the DWTEs' frequency, duration, and magnitude are explored. The potential influence of large-scale climate oscillations, including the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on the magnitude of DWTEs at the 30-day scale was assessed using Bayesian quantile regression. The results reveal (1) Extreme dry events were more prevalent and intense in the southern coastal area, whereas extreme wet events occurred predominantly and were more intense in the northern area. (2) High-frequency, high-magnitude DWTEs occurred along the coast at all time scales, and as the time scale increased, events with short duration shifted from the coast to the inland region. At the 30- and 90-day time scales, frequency generally decreased while magnitude increased, with the duration shortening in most regions. This indicates that the risk of DWTEs at short time scales has intensified over the past 60 years. (3) Strong large-scale climate oscillations significantly affected the DWTEs' magnitude. The NAO primarily impacted inland area, whereas ENSO and PDO exerted stronger influences on coastal area."

 The formation and scavenging of secondary aerosol under extremely high humidity conditions (relative humidity >80 %) remained as an issue in subtropical urban areas. In order to evaluate the effects of aqueous-phase oxidation and wet removal on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) composition and dynamics, a field campaign, which mainly used a time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF-ACSM) to characterized the non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) composition, was carried out during autumn fog-rain periods (FRPs) in Chongqing, Southwestern China. The chemical composition of PM2.5 was characterized, and the factors impacting SOA formation were analyzed. The effects of regional transport on SOA were also investigated. The results showed that SOA, which included less oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) and more oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA), dominated OA, contributing 80 % to total OA and 36 % to PM2.5. LO-OOA and MO-OOA concentrations increased with liquid water content (LWC) and oxidant levels (Ox), indicating aqueous-phase and photochemical pathways jointly promoted SOA formation. Compared to PreFRPs and PostFRPs, MO-OOA concentration decreased by 62 % and 1 % during FRPs, highlighting efficient wet scavenging. Notably, SOA exhibited higher removal efficiency than primary organic aerosol (POA), and MO-OOA tended to be more easily scavenged by fog and rain droplets than LO-OOA. Diurnal O/C ratios revealed enhanced nighttime oxidation under high humidity, while backward trajectories identified southern Chongqing as a key SOA source region. This study quantified the distinct scavenging efficiencies and formation processes of MO-OOA and LO-OOA under fog-rain conditions, bridging gaps in understanding SOA evolution in subtropical high-humidity environments."

 Bacteria are important components of bioaerosols as a potential source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. Previous studies have shown that bacteria can be activated as CCN, but the reported CCN forming potential can vary greatly among different studies and for different types of bacteria. In particular, the effect of atmospheric aging on the CCN activity of bacteria under atmospheric relevant conditions remains largely unknown. In this study, the CCN activity of airborne Escherichia coli (E. coli) was determined and the effects of biological aging and atmospheric exposures were examined by chamber simulation experiments. Results showed that the aerosolized E. coli particles displayed a bimodal size distribution, with a larger particle mode composed of whole cells and a smaller mode composed of bacterial fragments that were present at much higher number concentrations. The calculated hygroscopicity parameter κ was 0.08 ± 0.01 for the cell, and 0.16 ± 0.01 for the fragments in the presence of purified air. The CCN activity and hygroscopicity of E. coli varied significantly under different experimental conditions, with the magnitude of the change depending on the degree of aging, the atmospheric conditions and the type of pollutant gas. An even larger increase in κ was observed under actual ambient air compared with any single exposure. Our study indicates that the CCN activity of bioaerosols previously measured in the laboratory may not be applicable to real atmospheric conditions because the effects of atmospheric aging were not taken into account. Due to the sensitivity to environmental conditions, the cloud nucleating abilities of bioaerosols may be underestimated. Therefore, atmospheric interactions need to be considered in assessing the contribution of bioaerosols to the atmospheric CCN population and hence the impact on indirect climate forcing."

 This study presents a comparative analysis of the regional climate models COSMO-CLM (CCLM) and ICON-CLM (ICLM) over Italy, focusing on the year 2023. Given the widespread use of the high-resolution dataset VHR-REA_IT, produced by downscaling ERA5 reanalysis with CCLM at ~2.2 km over Italy, and the transition from CCLM to ICLM within the scientific communities (as the Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling COSMO and Climate Limited-area Modelling CLM), this work aims to assess the added value of using ICLM at convection-permitting scale over Italy during the recent impactful year 2023. Evaluation results and objective metrics, highlight a reduction in the warm bias of ICLM compared to CCLM with respect to the E-OBS gridded observation dataset, especially during the warmer months. Although CCLM shows a general good performance, ICLM improves the representation of daily accumulated precipitation in spring over territories with a complex orography and reduces the bias of wind speeds. Also, the diurnal cycles are generally improved. The ICLM added value is further proven by the analyses focusing on impactful events (two flooding events, a heatwave and a windstorm) hitting the Emilia-Romagna region during the year 2023. The evaluation indicates a general good agreement of ICLM outputs with gridded observations, supporting its adoption for future high-resolution downscaling reanalysis over Italy."

 A self-organizing map (SOM) was employed to classify extreme precipitation events (EPEs) in Pakistan into six types with distinct characteristics and spatial distributions. Types P1–P3 were concentrated in the southern regions and types P4–P6 were concentrated in the northern regions. We further illuminated the multiscale interaction mechanisms involved in the development of key synoptic systems that generate the six types of EPEs (P1–P6). Cross-scale transfers of kinetic energy (KE) and available potential energy (APE) occurred in P1, resulting in baroclinic and barotropic instability in the basic- and intraseasonal-scale windows. The development of an anticyclonic anomaly over western Russia and the South Asian High (SAH) anticyclone system led to the most intense and protracted EPEs. P2 was characterized by a cyclonic anomaly over western Russia and anticyclonic anomalies over Central Asia and eastern Russia, persisting over local areas in the original and intraseasonal-scale fields to promote the synoptic transient wave train activity. The basic scale being dominant in the baroclinic instability led to the westward shift of the EPEs. The SAH and an active synoptic cyclonic dominated P3, with convergence and diabatic heating, which intensified the EPEs. Although the distributions and driving mechanisms of P4–P6 differed, their energy flows were similar to those of P3, dominated by synoptic-scale spatial transport and diabatic heating. Notably, the intraseasonal-scale baroclinic instability occurred in P6, leading to the most frequent EPEs. Our study investigates the multiscale dynamic mechanisms of EPEs, providing valuable insights for advancing its understanding and prediction in Pakistan."

 Changes in Arctic sea ice have been shown to affect the climatic variability of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), but it remains unclear whether this Arctic-TP link has been stable over the past century. Using multiple reanalysis datasets (1900–2021), we found an interdecadal reversal in the relationship between winter Barents-Kara Sea ice concentration (BKSIC) and TP surface air temperature (TPSAT). In response to BKSIC loss, an out-of-phase pattern of “warm Arctic-cold TP” occurred during 1950–1975 (P1), while an in-phase pattern of “warm Arctic-warm TP” occurred during 1985–2021 (P2). The reversal of the BKSIC-TPSAT link is associated with changes in the position and strength of the subpolar and subtropical jet streams and quasi-stationary Rossby waves. During P1, the TPSAT was influenced by two distinct zonally oriented wave trains, associated with sea ice loss over the Greenland-Barents Kara Seas, the negative phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). The north branch of the wave train propagates eastward along the intensified subpolar jet stream, while the south branch of the wave train originated from the North Atlantic and propagates eastward through the subtropical jet stream into the southern TP. In contrast, during P2, prominent BKSIC loss with positive AMO leads to a weakened subpolar jet stream, which favors the meridional propagation of the wave train into the southern TP. This study highlights the potential role of BKSIC in driving differing TP atmospheric thermal conditions in the context of distinct AMO phases."

 The occurrence of severe convective weather (SCW) often poses significant threats to socio-economic stability and public safety.

We utilize Himawari-8/9 geostationary satellite imagery to identify severe convective clouds (SCCs) within large-scale regions through a multi-threshold sliding window (MTSW) algorithm, with validation using ground-based radar reflectivity data and real-world weather cases. Additionally, 507 SCW events were analyzed using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) datasets to investigate their relationship with the identified 12,177 SCCs. Finally, deep learning methods were further introduced to explore the quantitative correlation between SCCs and SCW. Key findings include: (1) Strong consistency between satellite-identified SCCs and high-reflectivity zones observed by ground-based radar; (2) The algorithm effectively detects convective clouds at various developmental stages, achieving an identification accuracy of 85 %; (3) Spatiotemporal analysis reveals that more than 90 % of severe convective weather (SCW) occurs within the coverage of SCCs and a 40 km buffer zone surrounding their boundaries, although the presence of SCCs does not necessarily lead to SCW; (4) By applying deep learning, the model attained a mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) score of 78 % in segmenting severe convective weather within SCCs.

 This study uses ground hail reports in the United States and Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory data from 2014 to 2022 to analyze the spatiotemporal evolutions of precipitation microphysical parameters (mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm), and generalized intercept parameter (Nw)) and its relationship with convective parameters during the two hours around hail. The results indicate that at 3 km above ground level, the regions with large raindrops, high reflectivity (Ze), high storm height and strong updrafts moved from northwest to southeast, indicating a typical hailstorm movement pattern. Vertically, the variations of Ze and Dm correlate well with their spatiotemporal variability at the 3 km. Regardless of altitude, Dm and Ze exhibited higher values in the northwestern sector prior to hail report time, while higher values shifted to the southeastern sector post-hail. Notably, Nw showed minimal temporal differences below 5 km, whereas above 5 km pre-hail Nw values were lower compared to post-hail. This suggests that different microphysical processes of precipitation particles may occur across different time periods and regions. Convective precipitation in hailstorm was primarily influenced by the collision-coalescence process, while stratiform precipitation primarily involved both break-up and collision-coalescence processes. Meanwhile, the height of 20/40 dBZ echo top (HT20/40) revealed nonlinear relationship with microphysical parameters.

 Vertical wind shear frequently occurs in complex terrain (basin and sloped terrain). However, compared with thermodynamic (temperature inversion) variables, the modulation of dynamic (wind shear) variables on air pollution is poorly understood due to scarce in-situ observations at complex terrain. In order to reveal the issues, we conducted the first collaborative field experiment of Boundary-Layer Meteorology and Pollution at western Sichuan Basin (BLMP-SCB) at a rural site from December 2018 to January 2019. A clockwise turning of the wind with the height was more frequent, especially for the rotation smaller than 20 degrees, which corresponded to the heavy air pollution near the ground surface. The surface heavy air pollution was jointly influenced by both low-level wind-directional shear and speed shear above that layer, especially the configuration of southeasterly winds below 1.0 km above sea level (regional transport) and increased southwesterly winds with height above the height (subsidence motion). The elevated wind-directional shear enhanced mechanical turbulence to transport downwards secondary pollutants to upper atmospheric boundary layer from the higher layer of air. The increased wind speed with height more easily triggered subsidence motion to trap more pollutants inside the basin. The work was helpful for fully understanding the role of meteorological variables in the formation and development of heavy air pollution at complex terrain, which will be favorable for making targeted pollution prevention and control measures at complex terrain."

 Climate change has intensified extreme droughts and strong winds in arid and semi-arid regions, accelerating soil wind erosion, dust emissions, and related environmental problems. Wind is the primary driver of soil wind erosion, with both speed and cumulative duration determining the intensity of the erosion process. Accurately characterizing regional wind speed and its cumulative duration is therefore essential for understanding the spatial distribution of soil wind erosion. Previous studies have mainly relied on weather station observations; however, their limited coverage, low temporal resolution and uneven spatial distribution have introduced significant uncertainties in regional assessments. To address these limitations, long-term reanalysis wind speed datasets have been developed, though their accuracy still needs further evaluation. In this paper, wind speed data from weather stations and from the ERA5-Land reanalysis product in the wind erosion region of northern China were collected to develop a predictive model for cumulative wind speed hours above the 5 m/s threshold, based on the XGBoost method combined with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. The results showed that, compared to the cumulative wind speed hours derived from the ERA5-Land product, the model predictions more closely aligned with corresponding weather station measurements. Across different months, the explained variance for cumulative wind speed hours in the test set increased from an initial range of 10–53 % to 60–75 %, accompanied by reductions in mean absolute error (MAE) by 0.15–0.67 h and root mean square error (RMSE) by 1.11–2.14 h. The model also performed well in both cross-time and cross-location applications, explaining 72 % of the variation in cumulative wind speed hours in the validation set. This outperformed the ERA5-Land product, which accounted for only 59 % of the variation, and significantly reduced the associated prediction errors. The constructed XGBoost model was further used to simulate the cumulative wind speed hours in the study region in 2020. Its spatial simulation accuracy was comparable to that of the ordinary kriging method, with superior performance in capturing spatial variation in areas with sparse weather station coverage. The results provide reliable data on the cumulative wind speed duration required for large-scale soil wind erosion prediction and related environmental research."

 Autumn in Korea, following the peak rainy season in summer, is of a great importance as it coincides with the intensive harvesting of crops and fruits. Hence, autumn rainfall critically affects agricultural production in Korea. This study shows the emergence of new rainfall peaks in autumn, leading to potentially significant agricultural damages. In the monthly period from September 10 to October 10, the total rainfall in the recent period (150 mm for 1998–2023) has increased by 44 mm compared to the previous period (106 mm for 1979–1997), averaged over 61 stations. Heavy rainfall days (≥ 100 mm day−1) have also occurred more frequently. The most plausible mechanism for these changes is the delayed retreat of the western North Pacific subtropical high in autumn which results in westward shift of tropical cyclone (TC) tracks and increased number of days on which Korea is affected by TCs. In addition, rising sea surface temperatures (0.5–1.0°C) in the western North Pacific and the South China Sea appear to be related to increased TC-induced heavy rainfall in Korea. Enhanced low-level moisture transports from these warm oceanic areas toward Korea, combined with upper-level wind divergence, are likely to have intensified the conditions for the TC-induced heavy rainfall. This study highlights the need for further research and public awareness of the changing autumn rainfall patterns and their impacts on agriculture and infrastructure."

 Heatwaves are documented to exert significant impacts on both ecosystems and human societies. Ground-based observation of temperature could provide fundamental data to acquire heatwave characteristics like intensity, frequency and duration, but are challenging to get information about event-based spatial area. Meanwhile, Spatial and temporal gaps in observational heatwave records also receive increasing attention, but quantitative approaches remain lacking. Here we use the high-resolution air temperatures from the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset (0.1° × 0.1) from 1950 to 2024, to acquire spatial scale of heatwave events using a spatiotemporally contiguous events tracking method. We compare spatial scale of heatwaves and the average distance of weather station network, which depicts the density, to address whether the station network is sufficient to capture heatwaves. The representativeness ratio was introduced as a metric describing how well the network density at a station captures nearby heatwave events in a given summer. We find the heatwaves at smaller scale (< 100 km) exhibit significant increase from 1950 to 2024, especially at nighttime. Meanwhile, there has been a continuously increase in the spatial density of worldwide weather stations. The coupling of these two trends drives spatially heterogeneous temporal evolutions of representativeness ratios in regional networks. The contiguous United States and Europe have consistently maintained high representativeness ratio (> 80 %), while some regions in South America and Africa exhibited poor representativeness ratio in the 1850s (< 20 %) but show significant improvement in recent periods (> 60 %). In these regions, the temporal changes in representativeness ratio may lead to overestimation of observed trends of heatwaves."

 The increasing demand for freshwater resources has intensified interest in precipitation enhancement technologies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Traditional cloud seeding methods that utilize crewed aircrafts have limitations in terms of safety, cost, and operational flexibility. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) offer promising complementary platforms by providing enhanced maneuverability, reduced risks, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, UAS can gather in situ high-resolution atmospheric data that are currently inaccessible via remote sensing techniques or crewed aircraft. This article provides a detailed introduction, history of UAS usage, and recent advancements in small UAS for cloud seeding, as well as presents the impacts, challenges, and future prospects. It then examines the different types of aircraft used for cloud seeding and discusses their specifications, functions, and sensors, as well as their pros and cons. Subsequently, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the small UAS used for precipitation enhancement, focusing on the types of small UAS suitable for cloud seeding, onboard equipment and sensors, ground station equipment and software, communication protocols, and methodologies, such as cloud seedability algorithms (CSA), path planning, and control autonomy. The integration of the Rapid Evaluation of Convective Cell Environments for Seeding (RECCES) algorithm built on top of the Lidar Radar Open Software Environment (LROSE) is also discussed for real-time cloud data acquisition and analysis, which are important for UAS cloud seeding missions. Advanced control-and-command communication systems between the UAS and ground stations are discussed, along with the regulatory requirements of the UAS for cloud seeding. The advantages, advancements, and challenges of UAS in precipitation enhancement are highlighted, and future prospects such as swarm technology, advanced sensor integration, centralized autonomy, de-icing technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, regulatory framework development, and environmental and ethical considerations are proposed in detail to pave the way for more efficient and effective UAS-based precipitation enhancement for cloud seeding operations."

In this study, we developed global maps of soil carbon change that reveal carbon gains and losses with forestation, primarily in the topsoil. Constraining land availability to avoid unintended albedo-induced warming and safeguard water and biodiversity (389 million hectares available for forestation globally) would sequester 39.9 petagrams of carbon by 2050, substantially below previous estimates.

Septal adipose tissue macrophages (sATMs), marked by CD209b and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, were long-lived and positioned in close proximity to adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) within the WAT septum. Within this shared niche, sATMs instructed the differentiation of ASCs into white adipocytes through transforming growth factor–β1 (TGFβ1). Depletion of sATMs, or the selective loss of TGFβ1 within tissue-resident macrophages, redirected ASC fate toward thermogenic adipocytes, enhancing WAT beiging and protecting against diet-induced obesity. These findings highlight the role of a discrete, anatomically defined macrophage population that governs ASC fate and orchestrates adipose tissue expansion."
