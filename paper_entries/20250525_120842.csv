The settling dynamics of particles are influenced by their macroscale shape, mesoscale roundness, and microscale surface properties, along with ambient fluid flow conditions. Variations in the wettability of submillimeter MPs affect molecular interactions at the particle–water interface, altering the microscopic flow field and subsequently modifying drag forces during settling. This study examines the impact of wettability on the settling behavior of aged acrylonitrile butadiene styrene MPs by measuring their settling velocities and contact angles. It was shown that increased wettability promotes the settlement of the MPs. A drag model incorporating the Eötvös number─a dimensionless ratio of buoyancy energy to contact angle-derived surface energy─is developed to quantify the relationship between interfacial chemistry and hydrodynamic resistance. Unlike the conventional models, our model considers wettability as a key factor controlling the settling of MP particles. The model was validated using independently measured data and four sets of published data for the MPs. Results demonstrate that the model significantly improves the accuracy of the settling predictions for weathering spherical MPs. Additionally, by integrating the shape factor, it effectively accounts for the settling behavior of irregularly shaped MPs using published data sets. This improvement enhances predictability for MP transport pathways, helping assess MP accumulation zones and potential ecological risks in marine and freshwater systems."

Alvarez;Wei Chen;Tong Zhang,Sequestering Mercury in Cation Traps of Iron-Phosphate Framework via Isomorphous Substitution Minimizes Microbial Methylation,"A critical consideration for the design of mercury (Hg)-removal materials is preventing microbial methylation of accumulated Hg, a process that forms the highly neurotoxic and bioaccumulative methylmercury (MeHg) during material disposal or post in situ remediation. Inspired by how natural minerals incorporate Hg impurities within crystalline structures through isomorphous substitution, we design an iron-phosphate framework (NH4)Fe2(PO4)2(OH)·2H2O (denoted as NFP) for highly effective Hg sequestration. With its large quantities of negatively charged oxygen-rich channels, NFP effectively attracts Hg and physically entraps the ions by forming Hg–O coordination bonds. Thus, NFP renders fast kinetics and high capacity for Hg adsorption, ensuring extremely low Hg release and minimal microbial methylation potential. Regulating crystal facets decreases the ion exchange energy between NFP and Hg2+, further enhancing the effectiveness of NFP. Notably, mimicking natural mineral formation not only endows NFP with high environmental compatibility and versatility. This bionic design offers a new strategy for tackling environmental pollution while avoiding generating secondary problems of even greater health concerns."

However, their effects on marine bacterial communities remain unclear. In this study, by conducting on-board microcosm experiments with anthropogenic East Asian PM in the oligotrophic South China Sea, the response of particle-associated (PA) bacteria was investigated and compared with its free-living (FL) counterparts. Results showed that PM input increased nutrient heterogeneity, shifting bacterial community composition and lifestyle. Copiotrophic PA bacteria became more abundant and contributed a disproportionately higher percentage to total bacterial production despite a decline in total bacterial abundance. FL bacteria showed increased diversity, shifting from oligotrophs to copiotrophs, while PA bacteria displayed reduced diversity and nondirectional compositional changes, suggesting their distinct assembly mechanisms in response to external nutrient inputs. Metagenomic analysis further revealed that PM drives a shift toward a copiotrophic, particle-attached lifestyle with upregulated pathways for chemotaxis, motility, and biofilm formation. Notably, PM addition also increased the relative abundance of oil-degrading taxa. These findings reveal the complexity of microbial responses to environmental perturbations and underscore the need to consider unique ecological niches and bacterial lifestyles."

To investigate these effects, we simulated PFAS exposure doses in animal models, ranging from general population to occupational levels, and analyzed blood and spleen samples. Epidemiological studies linked PFAS exposure to immunosuppression and hematotoxicity, while toxicogenomic analyses validated the underlying biological mechanisms. PFAS exposure caused immunotoxic effects, including altered blood parameters and lymphocyte edema. Cellular abnormalities such as decreased cytoplasmic density, incomplete rough endoplasmic reticulum, chromatin condensation, lymphocyte nuclear shrinkage, and reduced mitochondrial cristae were observed. Epidemiological evidence revealed a dose–response relationship between mixed PFAS exposure and hematologic indices such as hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), platelet count (PLT), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), white blood cell count (WBC), monocyte percentage, and platelet large cell ratio (PLCR), with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) playing a dominant role. Toxicogenomic analysis identified genes associated with platelets, anemia, and leukocyte function, linked to inflammation, Th17 cell differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, atherosclerosis, and JAK-STAT signaling. This study provides novel insights into the hematotoxicity and immunosuppressive effects of mixed PFAS exposure, emphasizing the need for PFAS substitution, removal, and policies addressing mixed exposures to protect public health."

However, air pollution in indoor environments, particularly in urban metro systems, has been largely neglected. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the spatiotemporal variations in particulate matter (PM) pollution inside metro stations and carriages across seven Chinese cities. Our results revealed consistently high levels of PM2.5 (16–621 μg/m3) within the urban metro platforms. Elevated concentrations of metro PM2.5 can occur even under low outdoor PM2.5 conditions. Furthermore, we found that metro PM2.5 levels exhibited significant spatiotemporal variations across metro environments; specifically, a higher fraction of PM2.5 was present in metro carriages than on platforms. Notably, black carbon (BC), a critical toxic constituent of PM2.5, exhibited significantly higher concentrations in carriages than those on platforms. Real-time monitoring and single-particle analysis revealed distinct sources of metro PM compared to outdoor air PM; particularly, Fe/Ni/Cr/Mn particles mainly originated from the abrasion of rails and brakes, while Cu-bearing particles and BC likely result from the degradation of conductive carbon brushes and wires. Our analysis demonstrated that irregular iron-containing particles derived from rail abrasion constituted approximately 90% of platform PM. These findings highlight the pressing need for air quality control in metro systems and provide valuable insights for public health assessments related to exposure to metro air."

However, the specific response of the dayside ionospheric electric field and its influence on the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) remain controversial. This study investigates the electromagnetic field response in the dayside equatorial region during isolated substorms using ground magnetic field data. Statistical analysis revealed that the H component decreased at equatorial and low‐latitude stations during isolated substorms. These decreases were of similar magnitude on average, indicating that significant changes in the EEJ caused by penetrating electric fields were not observed. However, individual events showed slight positive and negative variations. These results suggest that substorm‐associated electric fields can reach equatorial regions, but additional conditions determine the positive and negative variations.

Lehmann,Biomass‐Burning Contributions to Rainwater and Aerosol Constituents May Be Systematically Overestimated in Urban China,"Potassium (both water‐soluble K+ and elemental K) and levoglucosan (LG) are commonly used as chemical markers for emissions from biomass burning (BB). However, their application in complex urban environments, particularly in coal‐dominated regions, may be compromised by overlapping sources and atmospheric processes. Using a decade‐long data set (2005–2015) of rainwater chemistry and high‐resolution aerosol measurements (2018–2019) in Shanghai, China's largest megacity, this study quantitatively assesses the impacts of coal combustion on potassium and LG levels. Our analysis reveals that over 80% of K+ in rainwater and ∼53% of aerosol potassium originate from coal combustion as indicated by strong correlations with industrial SO2 emissions (r2 = 0.80–0.95). Similarly, LG concentrations are significantly impacted by coal combustion with molecular diagnostic ratios aligning with coal‐derived endmembers particularly during autumn. Considering the prevalence of coal‐based energy systems in most Chinese cities, we argue that pollution attributed to BB in rainwater and aerosol across urban China may be systematically overestimated when relying on currently broadly used BB tracers. By integrating long‐term observational data with receptor modeling, we further underscores the necessity of refining source attribution methodologies to better distinguish between BB and coal combustion impacts on air quality and climate in urban areas."

This study proposes an efficient plane‐parallel PRTM by a combination of machine learning (ML) techniques and traditional physical radiative transfer models. The atmosphere is decomposed into layers with independent optical properties, each have type‐specific polarized scattering parameterizations. To be more specific, a physics‐informed neural network (PINN) model that directly incorporates physical constraints into the ML process is developed to capture complex polarized interactions of cloudy layers. By independent training for atmospheric layers of different types, we can effectively enhance the generalization capability across realistic atmospheric profiles. The interconnection of the polarized states across multiple layers is achieved using the adding‐doubling method, which is optimized through a discretization scheme for efficient computation. The PINN model demonstrates remarkable physical consistency when simulating the radiative properties of both ice and water clouds. The mean absolute relative errors (MAREs) are 0.7% for ice clouds and 1.0% for water clouds, with the latter showing errors in regions characterized by strong scattering peaks. For multi‐layer cloud cases, the model produces an MARE of 0.9%. Compared to rigorous PRTMs, our model improves the computational efficiency by 3 orders of magnitude. The proposed PRTM can be readily adapted to account for distinct particle types, especially aerosols, by modifying the optical parameterization in the training data set, showing promise for more extensive applications in atmospheric research."

Carbonaceous aerosols (34 ± 12)%, mainly from domestic and waste biomass burning, and secondary inorganic aerosols (13 ± 6%) from anthropogenic combustion sources were also found. High βabs(λ) was observed at all sites, with an estimated mass absorption efficiency, MAE(λ), from (1,296 ± 472) 10−3 m2 g−1 at 375 nm to (621 ± 239)10−3 m2 g−1 at 850 nm.

BC was the major contributor to βabs(λ) at all wavelengths (>60%). The brown carbon contribution decreased with λ from (8–40) % at 375 nm to (1–23) % at 532 nm, and was higher in Cluster 1 than Cluster 2. Anthropogenic mineral dust in Cluster 2 appeared to be more light absorbing than pure desert dust and was a significant contributor to βabs(λ), constant with wavelength at ∼16%.

This study examines spatial precipitation patterns and their implications on urban hydrology over Chennai (a coastal megacity in South India) using geostationary satellite data from 2014 to 2022. An object detection algorithm (YOLOv5) was employed to identify core rainfall regions of propagating coastal storms and track their motion, detecting 55 and 71 rainfall events in urban and rural regions, respectively. Results show that urban regions experience a maximum downwind shift of ∼20 km in peak rainfall accumulation from the coastline, compared to a ∼12 km downwind shift in rural regions. However, differences in rainfall intensity during these propagating storms over the urban and rural cases were not significant. The convection‐permitting simulations of propagating storms revealed that the urban heat island effect drives warm‐moist easterly winds inland (relative to the rural region), leading to convergence and rainfall closer to the urban‐rural boundary on the downwind side. Further LULC sensitivity experiments indicate weakened penetration of easterlies, shifting convergence, and rainfall closer to the coastline when urbanization effects are absent. Hydrological model forced with simulated rainfall captured the observed reservoir inflows accurately. Specifically, the atmosphere‐hydrological coupled simulations showed higher cumulative reservoir inflow (∼41.64%) and river inflow into the city (∼49.3%) due to the urban‐induced spatial shift in the rainfall. These findings highlight that urban‐induced shifts in rainfall patterns from heavy storms, rather than increased intensity, can significantly impact river flow and heighten riverine flooding risks in coastal megacities."

Based on Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data, land grid data from ECMWF Re‐Analysis project data‐Interim (ERA‐Interim), ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land incorporating land surface hydrology (ERA5‐land) and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model 4 (GLEAM4) global land flux network (FLUXNET) data and weather observation data, the variability of the response of land‐atmosphere coupling processes to climate warming with the spatial change of the climate background in northern China was analyzed. The response mechanisms of the coupling processes between land evapotranspiration and soil moisture, and between surface net radiation and soil moisture to the spatial change of precipitation climate space (defined by the annual mean value of a given physical quantity) were investigated. Additionally, the effect of climate space on land‐atmosphere coupling characteristics was investigated. Results indicate that there were significant spatial differences in the trends of temperature and precipitation variation in northern China, and the characteristics of land‐atmosphere coupling in response to climate change were strongly reliant on the energy and moisture constraints in climate space. The summer monsoon transitional region (SMTR) was found to be a climate‐sensitive zone with competition between moisture and energy, where the response of land‐surface physical quantities to climate change underwent a radical transformation, and land‐atmosphere coupling processes displayed both positive feedback (temperature increasing→soil moisture decreasing→net radiation decreasing→temperature increasing) and negative feedback (temperature increasing→soil moisture decreasing→net radiation increasing→temperature decreasing) to climate warming. These findings would improve the scientific understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms of land‐atmosphere coupling processes for a heterogeneous underlying surface, and may provide an important theoretical basis for climate prediction in northern China."

Canup,Origin of compact exoplanetary systems during disk infall,"Compact exoplanetary systems masses have a similar mass ratio compared to the host star’s mass. Here, authors propose that these planets are surviving remnants of planet accretion during the end stages of stellar infall. 
 Exoplanetary systems that contain multiple planets on short-period orbits appear to be prevalent in the current observed exoplanetary population, yet the processes that give rise to such configurations remain poorly understood. A common prior assumption is that planetary accretion commences after the infall of gas and solids to the circumstellar disk ended. However, observational evidence indicates that accretion may begin earlier. We propose that compact systems are surviving remnants of planet accretion that occurred during the final phases of infall. In regions of the disk experiencing ongoing infall, the planetary mass is set by the balance between accretion of infalling solids and the increasingly rapid inward migration driven by the surrounding gas as the planet grows. This balance selects for similarly-sized planets whose mass is a function of infall and disk conditions. We show that infall-produced planets can survive until the gas disk disperses and migration ends, and that across a broad range of conditions, the mass of surviving systems is regulated to a few  × 10−5 to 10−4 times the host star’s mass. This provides an explanation for the similar mass ratios of known compact systems. Compact exoplanetary systems masses have a similar mass ratio compared to the host star’s mass.

Here, the authors analyse a large combined cohort to provide evidence of variant pathogenicity. 
 Clinical genetic testing identifies variants causal for hereditary cancer, information that is used for risk assessment and clinical management. Unfortunately, some variants identified are of uncertain clinical significance (VUS), complicating patient management. Case-control data is one evidence type used to classify VUS. As an initiative of the Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) Analytical Working Group we analyze germline sequencing data of BRCA1 and BRCA2 from 96,691 female breast cancer cases and 302,116 controls from three studies: the BRIDGES study of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility consortium, and the UK Biobank. We observe 11,207 BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants, with 6909 being coding, covering 23.4% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUS in ClinVar and 19.2% of ClinVar curated (likely) benign or pathogenic variants. Case-control likelihood ratio (ccLR) evidence is highly consistent with ClinVar assertions for (likely) benign or pathogenic variants; exhibiting 99.1% sensitivity and 95.3% specificity for BRCA1 and 93.3% sensitivity and 86.6% specificity for BRCA2. This approach provides case-control evidence for 787 unclassified variants; these include 579 with strong or moderate benign evidence and 10 with strong pathogenic evidence for which ccLR evidence is sufficient to alter clinical classification.

 Current catalysts face challenges with low formate selectivity at high current densities during the CO2 electroreduction. Here, we showcase a versatile strategy to enhance the formate production on p-block metal-based catalysts by incorporating noble metal atoms on their surface, refining oxygen affinity, and tuning adsorption of the critical oxygen-bound *OCHO intermediate. The formate yield is observed to afford a volcano-like dependence on the *OCHO binding strength across a series of modified catalysts. The rhodium-dispersed indium oxide (Rh/In2O3) catalyst exhibits impressive performances, achieving Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of formate exceeding 90% across a broad current density range of 0.20 to 1.21 A cm−2. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxophilic Rh site facilitates *OCHO formation by optimizing its adsorption energy, placing Rh/In2O3 near the volcano-shaped apex. A bipolar electrosynthesis system, coupling the CO2 reduction at the cathode with the formaldehyde oxidative dehydrogenation at the anode, further boosts the FE of formate to nearly 190% with pure hydrogen generation under an ampere-level current density and a low cell voltage of 2.5 V in a membrane electrode assembly cell.

Here, the authors design a dual-site Pt/CeO₂ catalyst that enables selective hydrogenation of S-nitroarenes by separating catalytic roles. 
 The liquid phase hydrogenation of nitroarenes is an important industrial reaction. The active sites are typically supported metal nanoparticles, which can be easily deactivated when sulfur groups are present in the substrate. Here, we report a new strategy for converting these S-containing nitroarenes by developing a dual-sites Pt/CeO2 catalyst consisting of highly defective CeO2 with abundant active oxygen vacancy and Pt sub-nano clusters. The hydrogenation of the nitro group in S-containing nitroarenes is induced to occur on the oxygen vacancies of the support rather than on the metal nanoparticles, which act only as the site of activating H2 by spillover. This functionality is not inhibited by strong chemisorption of the reactant S-groups, which is different from the hydrogenation of the nitro groups. Spillover H migrates to the oxygen vacancy site on the surface of defective CeO2, where the nitro-group is activated and reduced. This unconventional mechanism of hydrogenation is proven by combining many characterizations, theoretical modelling, kinetic and poisoning experiments. The best Pt/CeO2-300 catalyst shows a high reaction rate of 3.9 mmol·gcat.−1·h−1 with 5-amino benzothiazole selectivity of > 99%. It could produce over 145 kg·kgPt−1 of pure 5-amino benzothiazole in 250 hours on stream under continuous flow conditions. It is also proven and quantified by studying several molecules with different sizes and electronic structures that the accessibility of the -NO2 group to the Pt surface determines where the nitro groups are hydrogenated. Larger conjugated structures inhibit accessibility to the Pt surface of the -NO2 group, making it more prone to vacancy-activated nitro groups. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design and precise development of catalysts for the hydrogenation of liquid-phase chemicals containing S-groups. Liquid-phase hydrogenation of nitroarenes is a key industrial process, but conventional supported metal nanoparticles often suffer deactivation in the presence of sulfur-containing groups.

 Cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRR) for double-stranded RNA, such as RIG-I/MDA5, are key mediators of anti-viral responses. Here we screen for synergistic drug-virotherapy combinations and find that the reovirus type III Dearing strain (Rt3D)-palbociclib combination augments oncolytic virus-induced stress responses and increases interferon production and signaling. Data from RIG-I agonist and ER stress-inducing agents further confirms the crosstalk between RNA-sensing and ER stress in inducing cancer cell death and interferon production. Combined Rt3D-palbociclib also increases innate immune activation and IFN-induced HLA expression within tumor cells, with accompanying alterations in the epigenetic landscape and endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements. Analysis of the immunopeptidome in treated cells further reveals changes to HLA-captured peptides, including altered expression of peptides from cancer or testis antigens and ERVs. Our findings thus highlight the crosstalk between stress signaling and PRR activation for mediating enhanced anti-cancer efficacy.

 Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) share features and regulatory pathways with normal stem cells, yet how the stem cell niche contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify CXCR4+ macrophages as a niche population enriched in normal mammary ducts, where they promote the regenerative activity of basal cells in response to luminal cell-derived CXCL12. CXCL12 triggers AKT-mediated stabilization of β-catenin, which induces Wnt ligands and pro-migratory genes, enabling intraductal macrophage infiltration and supporting regenerative activity of basal cells. Notably, these same CXCR4+ niche macrophages regulate the tumor-initiating activity of various breast cancer subtypes by enhancing TIC survival and tumor-forming capacity, while promoting early immune evasion through regulatory T cell induction. Furthermore, a CXCR4+ niche macrophage gene signature correlates with poor prognosis in human breast cancer. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in orchestrating interactions between niche macrophages, mammary epithelial cells, and immune cells, thereby establishing a supportive niche for both normal tissue regeneration and mammary tumor initiation.

However, due to limited observations, the intra-lake heterogeneity of LSWT and its driving forces remain unclear.

No evident inter-annual LSWT changes were detected. Lake inflow (up to 40% contribution) was the main driver of LSWT variations from July to November, followed by air temperature. Spatially, LSWT intra-lake heterogeneity varied among lakes, with Siling Co showing the largest difference (nearly 4 °C) in autumn, mainly caused by river inflow locations and lake bathymetry.

 Biomineralization has existed on Earth for billions of years, documenting life evolution history and major geological events. However, determining the origins of putative biogenic minerals remains a persistent challenge. A prime example is the micrometer-sized fossil magnetite crystals (giant magnetofossils) discovered in global marine sediments, dating from the present to 97 Ma ago.

 Global warming is altering flood risks induced by rain-on-snow events. However, decision-makers lack guidance on how rain-on-snow induced extreme floods could be altered with warming. Here, storyline analyses using a kilometer-scale land surface model reveal diverse responses of four historically-impactful, decision-relevant rain-on-snow induced extreme flood events over the contiguous U.S. to warming, due to alterations in their water budgets. For the 2017-Feb California floods, runoff first increases and then decreases with warming, peaking under the +3 K scenario, while runoff of the 2017-Jan California floods increases monotonically by ~53%/K. Contrastingly, runoff of the 1996-Jan Mid-Atlantic floods decreases gradually with warming. Despite these differences, warming generally shifts flood-generating regimes along elevation profiles. High elevations could experience notably increased runoff, while low elevations encounter a shift from rain-on-snow-driven to rainfall-dominated runoff.

 In this study we investigate the direct emissions of a state-of-the-art battery gigafactory in Germany. We show that in a typical, state-of-the-art battery gigafactory large amounts of factory internal, process specific emissions are generated, namely 80 t/a of dusts, 510–850 t/a of gases and 2700 t/a of sludges. This are about 2.7% of the material overall used. We show that the most environmental and health critical process emissions are nickel-manganese-cobalt dust, copper dust and n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone gas. The emissions to the environment depend on the subsequent, location specific abatement system. By state-of-the-art abatement systems most of these substances can be removed, resulting in emissions of 0.087 kg/a nickel-manganese-cobalt, 0.006 kg/a copper and 196 kg/a n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone via air. We also show that in Germany, the legal limits for air emissions fall far short of the technical possibilities, which can result in the surrounding area being heavily loaded with carcinogenic nickel dusts.

 Radiative transfer models (RTM) enable the simulation of remote sensing observations and can therefore be useful for sensitivity analyses and model inversions, for example to determine the biophysical properties of vegetation. For this purpose, the calculation of observation derivatives is crucial. In this study, we propose to differentiate vegetation RTM based on Monte Carlo Ray tracing, PolVRT, as a function of the leaf area index (LAI). The variation of LAI is done considering the average leaf area (u). The difference between simulations corresponding to two areas close to each other (u and u′) is used to calculate the derivative as the limit when u′ approaches u. We propose in this work to adjust traced paths for u to simulate (u′), but such paths are weighted to correct their bias. This weighting is based on the technique of Importance Sampling. It increases the weighting of likely paths and conversely decreases it of unlikely ones. We have made a correction for the hot spot effect, since there is a strong dependency between the incident and backscattered paths. Our approach performances are verified using some discrete ROMC scene parameters and compared with the standard finite difference technique."

 Slow-moving landslides pose a substantial threat to communities and infrastructure, with annual creeping distances ranging from a few mm to hundreds of meters. To protect local communities from the landslide motion, landslide displacement retrieving or monitoring is necessary. However, traditional field investigations are time- and labor-consuming, which may limit the understanding of the landslide evolution and thereby mitigation. We propose a new 4D landslide displacement framework, combining satellite-based structure-from-motion, cross-correlation feature tracking for horizontal ground-surface deformation measurements with COSI-Corr, and DEM differencing for vertical ground-surface deformation. We apply this method to very high resolution (0.5 m) optical stereo images acquired by the Pléiades satellite constellation. We use our method to monitor the annual movement of the ‘La Valette’ landslide in the French Alps, between 2012 and 2022. During this period, the landslide moved most actively during the years 2012 and 2013, with average 3D displacement rates of 1.22 and 0.89 cm / day, respectively. Furthermore, we found a decelerating trend in movement rates from 2012 to 2022, which we attribute to warmer weather, decreasing precipitation rates, drier air conditions, and the implementation of a drainage installation. Our study demonstrates the potential of very-high resolution satellite stereo imagery for near-real time accurate monitoring of 4D landslide displacement, which benefits the tracking and hazard management of slow-moving landslides."

 Seasonal air and annual soil samples were collected across South Korea from industrial, urban, and suburban sites as part of a national monitoring campaign. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and pentachlorobenzene (PeCB) were analyzed in samples collected from 2008 to 2020 and 2013 to 2020, respectively. HCB showed a 13 % annual mean decline in air concentrations, but its mean concentration (255 pg/m3) remained 4.5 times higher than the mean concentration observed in the northern hemisphere. PeCB concentrations showed no significant temporal trends, indicating stabilized atmospheric levels. HCB displayed clear seasonal variations (summer > fall > spring > winter), while PeCB concentrations were slightly elevated during warmer seasons. Both compounds exhibited significantly higher air concentrations at urban and industrial sites than at suburban sites, with major industrial hubs like Ulsan, Gyeonggi, and Daegu identified as hotspots. While soil concentrations showed no temporal variation, they demonstrated distinct spatial patterns. HCB levels were potentially influenced by long-range atmospheric transport from continental Asia, while PeCB levels were attributed to soil re-volatilization. Fugacity fractions indicated that PeCB has reached stagnation levels, controlled by secondary sources (net volatilization), while HCB is approaching stagnation, exhibiting equilibrium conditions. These findings emphasize the need for sustained monitoring in urban and industrial areas to support and strengthen control measures."

 Atmospheric heatwave events have substantial socioeconomic impacts, which have been widely studied under global climate change. This study investigates the characteristics and differences between long-lived and short-lived heatwave events (LHWs and SHWs). First, we identify heatwave events over the Western North America (WNA) over 1981–2022 and categorize them based on the 90th percentile of their duration parameter. Then, we reveal that the LHWs exhibit stronger surface warming with a stronger and thicker warm layer. Circulation anomalies show an anomalous ridge above the WNA, which is more persistent with a greater central value of positive geopotential height anomalies for LHWs. Furthermore, we reveal the important role of mid-to-high-latitude teleconnection in maintaining the LHWs. We find that the diabatic heating released by increased precipitation near Japan can excite Rossby wave trains crossing the Pacific Ocean, and then reach North America, which contributes to maintaining the anomalous ridge of LHWs. Moreover, positive diabatic heating anomalies, related to land-atmosphere interaction, in Central Siberia are also favorable for the generation or persistence of the anomalous ridge and thus the LHWs. Finally, we validate the above teleconnection mechanisms by using the linear baroclinic model and Community Atmosphere Model 5.0 model. By comparison, there is negligible cross-Pacific propagation of Rossby wave energy before the peak of SHWs. This study presents evidence of climate linkages of East Asia and Central Siberia with WNA, which may provide potential predictability for LHWs over the WNA."

MLVgel is adhesive and moldable with low friction response, which provides moisture and responses to an infectious environment to deliver bactericidal and antioxidant effects in rat bacterial infection and burn wound models. By release control, instant short-term inflammation suppression is combined with sustained mechano-transduction signal inhibition. This dynamically modulates immune responses and delaysEn1+fibroblast activation via the YAP-TEAD pathway, ultimately facilitating scarless wound regeneration. Genomic analyses showed that the enhanced reepithelization and mechanoregulation by MLVgel during different wound phases are indispensable for its therapeutic outcomes.

Closed-basin brines, which generate ~40% of global lithium production, often have a circumneutral pH; however, during the evaporative concentration required for lithium production, the evaporated brines become acidic. Using primary geochemical and boron isotope data from the Salar de Uyuni (SDU), Bolivia combined with a modeling approach, we show that boron enrichment, which commonly co-occurs with lithium in closed-basin brines, is the primary factor in controlling the pH of brines from the SDU. We demonstrate that boron in global lithium- and boron-rich brines from closed basins exerts a similar influence on brine pH. The unique boron enrichments and its speciation can explain large proportions of alkalinity in these brines (~98% at the SDU), where evaporation alters the dissociation of boric acid, which triggers the formation of acidic evaporated brines."
