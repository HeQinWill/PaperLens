10.1088/1748-9326/ae18e7,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注森林生态系统中的火灾反馈机制和可逆性，探讨了频繁火灾导致的景观陷阱是否可以逆转。论文使用澳大利亚的森林环境作为案例，通过模型预测不同社会经济路径下的火灾频率，并分析气候变化和火灾管理政策对火灾面积的影响。研究结果表明，纠正火灾管理政策可以显著减少火灾面积，使森林摆脱易燃状态，从而逆转景观陷阱。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系，主要侧重于生态学和火灾管理领域。,[],Philip J Zylstra;David B Lindenmayer,Are the alternative ecosystem states produced by positive fire-flammability feedbacks reversible?,"Forest communities that have a positive flammability feedback to fire can enter a ‘landscape trap’ if disturbance levels are too frequent. It is not known whether this landscape trap constitutes an alternative stable state, or whether a forest can return to its original state when disturbance levels are reduced. Here, we examine a likely landscape trap caused by the frequent burning of a 528 343 ha forest environment in Australia and previously shown to have a positive fire-flammability feedback. We ask whether the now flammable landscape can be returned to its original low-flammability state, or if the transition is irreversible in the warming climate. Using site-specific empirical models of biophysical and climatic influences on fire frequency, we predict fire frequency up to the year 2100 for three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) in the context of different management approaches. A warming climate primarily increased wildfire area in our study area by increasing the frequency of synoptic changes, likely reflecting increased rates of escape from suppression firing efforts. Declining winter rainfall had the opposite effect, reducing wildfire area consistent with trends in other seasonally dry environments. The overall effect of warming was therefore a small but significant increase in wildfire area that was more severe under higher GHG emission scenarios. In contrast, removing prescribed burning and incentives for suppression firing had an effect size 2–5 times larger than did the increasing emissions scenarios, demonstrating that the landscape trap was reversible even under the worst-case emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0). Correcting fire management policies immediately reduced annual fire area by 87%, of which 77% was prescribed fire, and 43% of the remaining wildfire proportion was a by-product of the two policies. This allowed forests to escape their flammable age range, reversing a landscape trap. Our study is the first to demonstrate that such states are reversible."

Petersen;Thomas Holst;Cheng Wu;Radovan Krejci;Jeremy K. Chan;Claudia Mohr;Janne Rinne,BVOC and speciated monoterpene concentrations and fluxes at a Scandinavian boreal forest,"Ecosystem-scale emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are important for atmospheric chemistry. Here we investigate boreal BVOC fluxes from a forest in central Sweden. BVOC fluxes were measured above-canopy using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry, while compound-specific monoterpene (MT) fluxes were assessed using a concentration gradient method. We also evaluate the impact of chemical degradation on observed sesquiterpene (SQT) and nighttime MT fluxes. 
 Boreal forests emit terpenoid biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that significantly affect atmospheric chemistry. Our understanding of the variation of BVOC species emitted from boreal ecosystems is based on relatively few datasets, especially at the ecosystem-level. We conducted measurements to obtain BVOC flux observations above the boreal forest at the ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) station Norunda in central Sweden. The goal was to study concentrations and fluxes of terpenoids, including isoprene, speciated monoterpenes (MTs), and sesquiterpenes (SQTs), during a Scandinavian summer. Measurements (10 Hz sampling) from a Vocus proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Vocus PTR-ToF-MS) were used to quantify a wide range of BVOC fluxes, including total MT (386 (± 5) ng m−2 s−1; β=0.1 °C−1), using the eddy-covariance (EC) method. Surface-layer gradient (SLG) flux measurements were performed on selected daytime sampling periods, using thermal-desorption adsorbent tube sampling, to establish speciated MT fluxes. The effect of chemical degradation on measured terpenoid fluxes relative to surface exchange rates (F/E) was also investigated using stochastic Lagrangian transport modeling in forest-canopy. While the effect on isoprene was within EC-flux uncertainty (FISO/EISO <  5 %), the effect on SQT and nighttime MT was significant, with average F/E ratios for nighttime FMT/EMT= ca. 0.9 (0.87–0.93), nighttime FSQT/ESQT=0.35 (0.31–0.41), and daytime FSQT/ESQT=0.41 (0.37–0.47). The main compounds contributing to MT flux were α-pinene and Δ3-carene. Summer shifts in speciated MT emissions for Δ3-carene were detected, featuring a decrease in its relative fraction among observed MT compounds from June to August sampling periods, indicating that closer attention to seasonality of individual MT species in BVOC emission and climate models is warranted."

In heavily polluted urban areas, where clusters are formed rapidly and in large numbers, cluster–cluster collisions also become relevant. We calculate cluster–cluster collision rates from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and an interacting hard-sphere model. Not accounting for long-range attractive interactions underestimates collision and particle formation rates significantly. 
 Collisions of neutral molecules and clusters is the most prevalent pathway in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF), with direct implications for air quality and climate. Until recently, these collisions have been modeled mainly using non-interacting hard-sphere (NHS) models, which systematically underestimate collision and particle formation rates due to omission of long-range interactions. Lately, atomistic simulations which account for long-range interactions have been used to study neutral molecule–molecule and molecule–cluster collisions, but studies on cluster–cluster collisions have still been lacking despite the relevant role they can play, e.g., in haze formation in polluted urban areas. We have therefore studied collisions between neutral clusters of N bisulfate and N dimethylammonium ions at T=300 K up to N=32 using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Direct simulation results have then been compared against both the traditional NHS model and the newly proposed interacting hard-sphere (IHS) variant. We find the collision rates given by the NHS to be enhanced by a factor of 2.18–5.61 in the atomistic MD simulations, with enhancement decreasing with cluster size, and an asymptotic limit ≈2. The IHS model yields a constant enhancement factor of 3.36 over the NHS model for collisions between same-sized clusters, which decreases with increasing cluster size ratio. Our results demonstrate how even collisions between clusters of tens of acid–base pairs at a relatively high temperature cannot be accurately modeled by neglecting long-range interactions. We also show that the MD results cannot be reproduced by simple point-particle models, highlighting the importance of atomistic details of intermolecular interactions."

Kaiser-Weiss,German methane fluxes estimated top-down  using ICON–ART – Part 1: Ensemble-enhanced   scaling inversion,"Estimating emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane for individual countries is fundamental for climate mitigation policies. Numerical models can simulate how such emissions are transported to observation sites. Based on the observations, one can estimate the emissions. We describe how operational numerical weather prediction can help determine the model uncertainties and thereby improve the emission estimates. We test our system using simulated observations. 
 This two-part study explores the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions using atmospheric observations in order to validate national emission inventories. Inverse methods can support emission quantification at the national scale based on observations and atmospheric transport simulations, yet, they are often limited by the observation coverage, transport model uncertainties, and inversion methodologies. Here, we introduce a system for regional estimation of methane fluxes and apply this to Central Europe with a focus on Germany, where we distinguish emissions from different anthropogenic sectors. We evaluate the robustness of the method using sensitivity tests with in-situ observations from the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS). Using synthetic observation experiments, we estimate the impact of transport errors on the flux estimates. The atmospheric transport is calculated employing the numerical weather prediction model ICON with its module ART at 6.5 km resolution, sampling the meteorological uncertainty with a 12-member transport ensemble. The same transport ensemble is used to generate pseudo-observations with a simulated transport uncertainty. Posterior fluxes are estimated with a synthesis inversion method for three different approximations of the model–observation error covariance matrix. We find that using ensemble-estimated transport uncertainties can significantly reduce the random error of emission estimates. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing biases in flux inversions for reliable, observation-based emission estimates."

Köhler;Axel Seifert;Linda Schlemmer,Predicting ice supersaturation for contrail avoidance: ensemble forecasting using ICON with two-moment ice microphysics,"Persistent condensation trails typically occur due to aircraft flying through certain cold and humid regions. In most cases, these contrails have a warming impact on the climate. Predicting these regions in advance allows flight planners to re-route airplanes. We show that an adaptation of the ice microphysics scheme in a certain weather forecast model improves the prediction of these regions. Running an ensemble of simulations with this scheme improves the prediction quality even further. 
 Persistent contrails and contrail-induced cirrus clouds are considered the most significant non-CO2 contributors to aviation's climate impact. These clouds primarily form in ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs), defined by relative humidity over ice (RHice) exceeding 100 %. Reliable prediction of RHice in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere allows mitigating their formation by re-routing flights. We implemented a two-moment cloud ice microphysics parameterization within a ten-member Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) using the global ICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) model. RHice predictions were evaluated against radiosonde and aircraft observations from the Northern Hemisphere during 2024–2025. Treating ISSR prediction (RHice > 100 %) as a binary classification problem, we find that the probability of detection (POD) of ISSRs increases to 0.6 for the two-moment scheme (ICON 2-Mom), compared to 0.4 for the operational ICON with a one-moment ice microphysics scheme, while maintaining a low false positive rate (FPR < 0.1). Further evaluation of the ICON 2-Mom EPS using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis shows a POD of 0.8 for a decision model that requires at least three ensemble members to predict ISSR, with an FPR of 0.13. Additionally, we incorporate ensemble spread information to develop a meta-model that further reduces the FPR. Since June 2024, more than 100 flights have been rerouted based on ICON 2-Mom EPS predictions in a contrail avoidance trial, demonstrating the practical value of improved ISSR forecasts for climate-conscious aviation. This study highlights the significant potential of ensemble-based modeling for predicting ISSRs and RHice, supporting environmentally optimized flight planning and advancing applications in weather and climate science."

 A reliable quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is important for climate change mitigation strategies. Inverse methods based on observations and atmospheric transport simulations can support emission quantification at the national scale, yet, they are often limited by the observing systems, transport model uncertainties, and inversion methodologies. This two-part study introduces a system for observation-based, regional methane flux estimation. In the present Part 2, we apply this system to estimate German methane emissions in 2021. The numerical weather prediction model ICON with its ART module for trace gases is used to simulate the atmospheric transport while estimating uncertainties using a transport ensemble. We use a priori fluxes from national reporting to facilitate the validation of reported fluxes. Posterior fluxes are estimated with a modified synthesis inversion method introduced in Part 1, relying on in-situ observations. Compared to the a priori, we find a significant increase in methane emissions in Germany and in the Benelux. We estimate German methane emissions (32±19) % higher than the anthropogenic emissions in the national inventory, and our inversion method attributes this difference mainly to the agricultural sector, although separation from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) as well as natural fluxes requires further research. The combination of an ensemble-enhanced numerical weather prediction model for atmospheric transport and good observation coverage paves the way to sector-specific, observation-based national emission estimates."

Active measurements are used to train and validate a newly developed random forest algorithm that is applied to passive satellite imagery to estimate the ice crystal icing conditions probability. 83 % of ice crystal icing conditions are correctly detected, showing potential for an operational implementation to mitigate its negative effects on the fleet. 
 High ice water content (HIWC) conditions are a concern for aviation as the ingestion of ice particles in the jet engines can induce ice crystal icing (ICI), which results in performance loss and damage. To constantly monitor these conditions, retrievals for the detection of ICI were recently developed based on geostationary satellite imagery, but their calibration is limited to targeted flight campaigns or scattered samplings from ICI events databases. In this work, we close this gap, using exclusively remote sensing data to develop and assess a new retrieval for potential ICI conditions.Cloud IWC measurements are provided from the synergy of radar and lidar (DARDAR) on board the polar-orbiting satellites CloudSat and CALIPSO. HIWC conditions (IWC≥0.5 g m−3) at typical cruise altitudes are used as the proxy for areas with potential ICI formation. The HIWC conditions predictors are taken from a combination of observations and retrievals of the geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). A random forest is trained and tested based on the collocated dataset of active and passive measurements during the summer months of 2013 and 2015, covering the European domain. The input predictors are the brightness temperature difference between the MSG channels at 6.2 and 10.8 µm wavelengths, the visible channel at 0.6 µm wavelength, the cloud optical thickness at 0.6 µm wavelength, and four convection metrics related to the distance to the closest convective cell, area extent of the convective cells, and convection density in the pixel surroundings. Over Europe, 83 % of HIWC conditions measured in the DARDAR dataset are correctly detected. The associated false alarm rate is 51 %. The retrieval is further tested with the ICI events database reported by Lufthansa. Four out of seven events are correctly detected. In conclusion, the retrieval achieves performances comparable to previously developed retrievals. An operational application would enable aircraft rerouting around areas with high ICI probability."

But the major drawback was the larger uncertainties associated with the measurements. To minimize the uncertainties, improved calibration standards, measurement techniques and sensors were developed. In this study we are validating the a newly developed Bi-Tec sensor spectroradiometer with an average uncertainty of 0.53 % with world radiometric reference (WRR) and international system of units (SI). 
 Accurate, precise and traceable measurements of total and spectral solar irradiance measurements are fundamental for solar energy applications, climate studies, and satellite validation. In this study, we assess the performance and the quality of the data from a commercially available, compact Bi-Tec Sensor (BTS) Spectroradiometer system, by comparing its spectrally integrated total solar irradiance (TSI) values with an electric substitution cavity radiometer (PMO2), which is traceable to the World Radiometric Reference (WRR). The resulting ratio between BTS Spectroradiometer system and WRR-traceable TSI is 0.9975 with a standard deviation of 0.0050. Applying a correction factor of (–) 0.34 % to PMO2, accounting for the known offset between WRR and the International system of Units (SI) results in a relative difference between the BTS Spectroradiometer system derived TSI and PMO2 of +0.09 % with a standard deviation of 0.0050 demonstrating good consistency between BTS derived TSI and the cavity radiometer.This comparison confirms the precision and accuracy of the BTS spectroradiometer system, and its capability to deliver SI traceable TSI from spectrally resolved solar irradiance measurements. Its spectral resolution enables accurate measurements of spectral solar irradiance, which are essential, not only for determining total solar irradiance but also for retrieving key atmospheric gases such as water vapor, ozone, and aerosols, establishing its relevance as a compact instrument for atmospheric and climate research."

The new maps showed improved accuracy in reflecting local economies, revealing that sectoral GDP distribution differs by country and affects disaster impact estimates. 
 Global risk assessments of economic losses by natural disasters while considering various land uses is essential. However, sector-specific, high-resolution pixel-level economic data are not yet available globally to assess exposure to local disasters such as floods. In this study, we employed new land-use data to construct a global, spatially distributed map of sector-specific gross domestic product (GDP). We developed three global GDP maps, SectGDP30, in 2010, 2015, and 2020 for the service, industry, and agriculture sector with 30 arcsec resolution. The map (SectGDP30) demonstrates strong consistency (R2 > 0.9) with actual sub-national statistical data, exhibiting superior alignment compared to conventional GDP maps (PB-method) reliant solely on gridded population information. The methodology refined GDP distribution for specific sectors. Industry GDP was more accurately mapped using non-residential land areas as a proxy, effectively capturing its localized concentrations. Agriculture GDP's accuracy improved by incorporating cropland data and a distance-based distribution assumption from population agglomeration. Application of this dataset in estimating flood-induced business interruption (BI) losses confirmed the map's capacity to represent inter-sectoral differences in estimated losses, reflecting varied hazard spatial distributions. This underscores the importance of considering sector-specific spatial patterns for accurate disaster damage assessment. These maps serve as a foundational tool for estimating detailed, sector-classified economic losses, enabling precise calculation of sector-specific impacts from diverse natural disasters worldwide.

This is the first open dataset to offer high quality, consistent, and complete building data in 2D and 3D form at the individual building level on a global scale. Towards this dataset, we developed machine learning-based pipelines to derive building polygons and heights (called GBA.Height) from global PlanetScope satellite data, respectively. Also a quality-based fusion strategy was employed to generate higher-quality polygons (called GBA.Polygon) based on existing open building polygons, including our own derived one. With more than 2.75 billion buildings worldwide, GBA.Polygon surpasses the most comprehensive database to date by more than 1 billion buildings. GBA.Height offers the most detailed and accurate global 3D building height maps to date, achieving a spatial resolution of 3 m × 3 m – 30 times finer than previous global products (90 m), enabling a high-resolution and reliable analysis of building volumes at both local and global scales.

 Dissolved oxygen (DO) serves as an essential indicator of marine ecosystem health. However, sparse and uneven observations have limited our ability to characterize its full spatiotemporal variability, underscoring the continued need for long-term, high-resolution, and physically consistent global DO datasets. Here, we present GEOXYGEN, a global dataset of monthly DO fields at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution spanning 1960–2024 and depths from the surface to 5500 m (Wang et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17615657). GEOXYGEN is generated with a hierarchical modeling framework that accounts for regional and vertical heterogeneity. By integrating physical and biogeochemical predictors with an adaptive feature-selection strategy, GEOXYGEN achieves high predictive accuracy across all depth layers on an independent out-of-time test (R² > 0.92). The reconstructed spatial patterns align closely with the World Ocean Atlas 2023 climatology, and in subsurface and deep waters, GEOXYGEN demonstrates superior generalization relative to existing data-driven products. A sensitivity analysis further reveals that including coastal data in model training increases basin-wide uncertainty by approximately 7.5 %, underscoring that current observing systems remain insufficient to reliably resolve nearshore DO dynamics. GEOXYGEN provides a consistent, physically informed baseline for analyzing global and regional variability of DO. It also offers a valuable benchmark for evaluating and improving the representation of DO in climate and Earth system models and can support future studies on long-term deoxygenation trends and regional hotspots."

Hybrid models, which integrate physical principles with sparse observations, offer a promising path forward.This study introduces the Hybrid Lake Model v1.0 (HyLake v1.0), a novel framework that combines physics-based surface energy balance equations with a Bayesian Optimized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-based (BO-BLSTM-based) surrogate to approximate lake surface temperature (LST) dynamics. The model was trained using data from the Meiliangwan (MLW) site in Lake Taihu. We evaluate HyLake v1.0 against the Freshwater Lake (FLake) model and other hybrid benchmarks (Baseline and TaihuScene) across multiple sites in Lake Taihu using both eddy flux covariance observations and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data.Results show that HyLake v1.0 outperformed all comparative models at the MLW site and demonstrated strong capability in simulating lake-atmosphere interactions. In experiments assessing generalization and transferability in ungauged lake sites, HyLake v1.0 consistently exhibited superior performance over FLake and TaihuScene across all Lake Taihu sites using both observation- and ERA5-based forcing. It also maintained excellent skill when applied to the ungauged Chaohu, confirming its robustness even with unlearned forcing datasets. This study underscores the potential of hybrid modeling to advance the representation land-atmosphere interaction in Earth system models."

Biases in the often-uncertain BCs propagate to the inferred fluxes. We develop a framework to explain how errors in the BCs influence the optimized fluxes, derive two metrics to estimate this influence, and compare two methods to correct for the biases. We demonstrate correcting BCs directly is more effective at reducing bias. 
 Regional inverse analyses of atmospheric trace gas observations quantify gridded two-dimensional surface fluxes by fitting the observations to simulated concentrations from a transport model, usually by Bayesian optimization regularized by a gridded prior flux estimate. Regional inversions rely on the specification of background concentrations given by the boundary conditions (BCs) at the edges of the inversion domain, but biases in the BCs propagate to biases in the optimized fluxes. We develop a theoretical framework to explain how errors in the BCs influence the optimized fluxes as a function of the prior and observing system error statistics and of model transport. We derive a preview metric to estimate the BC-induced errors before conducting an inversion to support domain specification and a diagnostic metric to accurately quantify these errors after solving the inversion. We compare two methods to correct BC biases as part of an inversion, either directly by optimizing BC concentrations (boundary method) or indirectly by expanding the domain and correcting grid cell fluxes outside the region of interest (buffer method). We demonstrate that the boundary method is generally more accurate, physically grounded, and computationally tractable."

As Mercury's largest mascon basin, identifying Caloris' configuration prior to volcanic infilling is a key step in determining the series of events that led to its current state. Here, we simulate the postimpact evolution of Caloris basin to explore the influence of cooling and isostatic adjustment on its configuration before volcanic plains emplacement. We find that the large volume of buoyant impact‐heated material uplifts the basin floor before cooling, explaining some of Caloris' long‐wavelength topographic variations. Subsequent thermal contraction and lithospheric thickening create a positive mass anomaly at Caloris' center before its volcanic infilling. This evolution shows a new mode of mascon formation—perhaps unique to Mercury where high impact velocities generate large volumes of impacted‐heated material—and provides a new interpretation of Caloris' geologic history."

Convection‐permitting models (CPMs) are increasingly used in climate studies, as they better represent many precipitation processes than non‐CPMs. We found significant differences in precipitation moisture sources over the Amazon Basin using 1‐year CPM and non‐CPM WRF simulations with moisture tracers. Notably, the CPM estimates that about half of precipitation in the central Andes comes from the Amazon basin; a 20%–30% higher estimate than the non‐CPM. This suggests long‐term CPMs with tracers could improve climatological estimates. However, their high computational cost is prohibitive. To overcome this, we developed a revised 2L‐DRM model that replicates CPM‐with‐tracers estimates at a fraction of the cost, using only standard outputs. We applied this model to South America, analyzing precipitation moisture sources across 15 regions. 2L‐DRM can be used for other regions as continental‐scale CPM climatological simulations become available."

Here we report its clear identification in a shale‐gas well core and explore its potential as a proxy for diagenesis or low‐grade metamorphism of organic‐rich sediments. A range of complementary results including petrography, geochemistry, rock magnetism and paleomagnetism, collectively support the identification of framboidal pyrrhotite, whose coexistence with other framboidal minerals indicates pseudomorphic replacement of framboidal pyrite. A strong correlation between total organic carbon and natural remanent magnetization, together with its restriction to organic‐rich layers, highlights organic matter's role in its genesis. Paleomagnetic and vitrinite reflectance data further link its formation to magmatic heating (∼274°C). We therefore propose hydrothermal replacement of framboidal pyrite by framboidal pyrrhotite, involving heating and organic matter.

Column‐scale tracer tests using sodium chloride and resazurin, coupled with subsurface transport modeling, quantified respiration rates over 77 days.

Paradoxically, elevated temperatures reduced bioclogging, constrained microbial metabolism, and altered reaction‐transport dynamics. Instead of maintaining a fixed state, Damköhler numbers (Da) shifted dynamically, transitioning from reaction‐limited (Da < 1) to transport‐limited (Da > 1) conditions during biofilm development, with these shifts dampened at higher temperatures.

A novel index of convective rainfall deviation is defined in this study to quantify the spatial discrepancy between surface rainfall and cold‐cloud shields, utilizing the FY‐4A brightness temperature data and surface rainfall observation data from across China. The results show that systems with larger deviations are more prevalent in southern China. For small‐deviation systems, surface rainfall closely coincides with the coldest center of the cloud shields. However, in medium‐deviation systems, rainfall occurs southwest of the coldest center, with relatively expanded but weakened rainfall beneath the cloud shields. Retaining a pronounced southwestern deviation signature, large‐deviation systems also present a secondary northeastern rainfall center. This complex spatial pattern is associated with increased cloud tilting driven by the configuration of environmental updrafts and low‐level southwesterly wind shears."

However, research on LMI in the South China Sea (SCS) is limited. Our study found a significant increase in LMI amplitude in the SCS since the 1980s. This change was driven by decreasing LMI of local TCs and increasing LMI of migratory TCs from the western North Pacific. Attribution analysis showed that a westward shift in local TC genesis increased land constraints, suppressed TC development, and weakened LMI. In contrast, the poleward migration of TC tracks facilitated the increased entry of storms into the SCS through the Luzon Strait with minimal land interaction, thereby enhancing the LMI of migratory TCs. Additionally, favorable environmental conditions increase the frequency of rapid intensification events, further boosting LMI.

VHF Stratosphere‐Troposphere radars, however, provide methods to measure vertical air velocities (W) $W)$ in the tropo‐stratosphere. From Middle and Upper (MU) atmosphere radar data spanning 38 years (1987–2024), we found that the well‐known reversal in mean W $W$ profiles at the height of the jet stream maximum, with negative W $W$ below 12 km and positive W $W$ above occurs almost every month, not just in winter as previously reported. We developed a refined model, complementary to the ad‐hoc model by Muschinski (1996), https://doi.org/10.1175/1520‐0450(1996)035%3C2210:PEOKHI%3E2.0.CO;2, which accounts for power imbalance between symmetric oblique beams. This model confirms that the monthly mean W $W$ profiles above ∼4.0 km are primarily influenced by contamination from a slight tilt in the scatter diagram, induced by horizontal wind shear. Additionally, our analysis of 30 years of ERA5 reanalysis data indicates that adiabatic ascent/descent along potential temperature surfaces can also cause a W $W$ reversal in winter, consistent with earlier studies. However, the climatological mean vertical velocities are much weaker than those observed by the MU radar, suggesting that wind shear‐induced layer tilt dominates the long‐term effect."

These processes, difficult to observe directly, are diagnosed from satellite retrievals of precipitation (P) and atmospheric cloud radiative effect (ACRE) with the aid of a simple theory. It is found that hourly changes of P and ACRE projected onto the P‐ACRE plane have a tendency of pointing toward a settling point at LP ∼ ${\sim} $ 700 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ and ACRE ∼ ${\sim} $ 75 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$, corresponding to a state of midheavy ascent. These physically driven transitions are counteracted largely by inverse transitions ascribed mainly to the stochastic effects due to a sample density gradient, except where samples are very few. The net effect of these mutually competing transitions is an evolutionary path qualitatively reminiscent of the known Lagrangian life cycle of a traveling convective system, whereas the P‐ACRE trajectory stays in the close vicinity of the settling point when spatially averaged over the system."

However, the underlying mechanism of the evolutions of spatiotemporally contiguous summer HWs remains unclear hindering the forecasting of HWs. Therefore, a 3D perspective of HWs was introduced in the present work (i.e., latitude × longitude × time), which can track the horizontal evolution of HWs continuously. Here, our work objectively followed the 3D evolutions of regional summer HWs in China during 1979–2022, and investigated their characteristics, including intensity, duration, and affected area. Among them, the dynamic evolutions of 29 HWs are influenced by compound typhoons and high‐pressure systems. Specifically, the high‐pressure system affects the triggering and maintenance of regional HWs by enhancing the surface heating and subsidence warming, whereas typhoon tracks can modulate the retreat of regional HWs. Westward‐moving typhoons that are influenced by easterly airflows on the southern edge of strong inland high‐pressure systems can force the high‐pressure system to slowly retreat eastward. This interaction results in a long duration and a large affected area of regional HWs. In contrast, northeastward‐moving typhoons quickly cut the weak inland high‐pressure system, and then the fragmented high‐pressure systems in turn promote the northeastward movement of typhoons, leading to the low intensity, short duration, and small affected area of the regional HWs. These findings systematically reveal the interactions between inland high‐pressure systems and typhoon tracks and provide new insights for improving the warning and forecasting skills for the 3D evolution of spatiotemporally contiguous HWs."

It provides an unprecedented observational source for enhancing numerical weather prediction (NWP), especially for high‐impact weather events. Currently, GIIRS is limited to clear‐sky radiance assimilation in operational system, and a large amount of cloud‐affected data have not been effectively utilized. The cloud‐clearing technology can eliminate the cloud effects to obtain the cloud‐cleared radiances (CCRs), which is an alternative method to realize the assimilation of cloudy‐sky infrared observation. A high‐precision cloud mask retrieved from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) is used to calculate the GIIRS CCRs in this study. A comparative analysis of the bias characteristics reveals that the CCRs exhibit larger standard deviation of O‐B than clear‐sky radiances. To evaluate the impact of GIIRS CCRs on NWP, a 1‐month cycle assimilation and forecast experiments are carried out based on China Meteorological Administration Global Forecast System (CMA‐GFS). The results show that CCRs increase the amount of assimilated GIIRS observations by nearly 50%. Compared with the control experiment, CCRs assimilation has a modest positive contribution to the analysis fields, including geopotential height, low‐level humidity, and wind fields. Additionally, it improves the forecast fields of geopotential height and precipitation skill scores, demonstrating better forecast potential in typhoon weather processes. This study provides valuable insights for the prospective operational application of FY‐4B GIIRS CCRs in NWP."

 HIV cure is exceptionally rare, documented in only six cases among the estimated 88 million individuals who have acquired HIV since the epidemic's onset1–6. Successful cures, including the pioneering Berlin patient, are limited to individuals receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants (allo-SCT) for hematological cancers. HIV resistance from stem cell donors with the rare homozygous CCR5 Δ32 mutation was long considered the main mechanism for HIV remission without antiretroviral therapy (ART), but recent reports highlight CCR5-independent mechanisms as important contributors to HIV cure6–8. Here, we provide new evidence for this conceptual shift, reporting exceptionally long, treatment-free HIV remission following allo-SCT with functionally active CCR5. A heterozygous CCR5 wild-type/Δ32 male living with HIV received allo-SCT from an HLA-matched unrelated heterozygous CCR5 wild-type/Δ32 donor as treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. Three years after allo-SCT, the patient discontinued ART. To date, HIV remission has been sustained for over six years with undetectable plasma HIV RNA. Reservoir analysis revealed intact proviral HIV before transplantation, but no replication-competent virus in blood or intestinal tissues after allo-SCT. Declining or absent HIV-specific antibody and T cell responses support the absence of viral activity. High antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity at the time of transplantation may have contributed to HIV reservoir clearance. These results demonstrate that CCR5Δ32-mediated HIV resistance is not essential for durable remission, underscoring the importance of effective viral reservoir reductions in HIV cure strategies."

 The identification of therapeutic strategies to induce sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free control of HIV infection is a major priority.1 Combination immunotherapy including HIV vaccination, immune stimulation/latency reversal, and passive transfer of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has shown promise in non-human primate models,2–6 but few studies have translated such approaches into people. We performed a single-arm, proof-of-concept study in ten people with HIV on ART combining the following three approaches: (1) therapeutic vaccination with an HIV/Gag conserved element (CE)-targeted DNA+IL-12 prime/MVA boost regimen followed by (2) administration of two bNAbs (10-1074, VRC07-523LS) and a toll-like receptor 9 agonist (lefitolimod) during ART suppression, followed by (3) repeat bNAb administration at the time of ART interruption (NCT04357821). Seven of the ten participants exhibited post-intervention control after stopping ART, independent of residual bNAb plasma levels. Robust expansion of activated CD8+ T cells early in response to rebounding virus correlated with lower median viral load following peak viremia off ART. These data suggest that combination immunotherapy approaches might prove effective to induce sustained control of HIV by slowing rebound and improving CD8+ T cell responses, and that these approaches should continue to be optimized."

 Past atmospheric CO2 fluctuations are thought to be intricately tied to ocean circulation changes involving Southern Ocean and North Atlantic dynamics. The ocean’s capability to store carbon has been linked to the expansion and contraction of southern-sourced waters, but their provenance and structure remain poorly characterized in the past. Here we present neodymium isotope data from the Weddell–Enderby Basin, placing constraints on the spatiotemporal distribution of Antarctic Bottom Water in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean over the past 32,000 years. Our data reveal that glacial Antarctic Bottom Water was substantially contracted, with large volumes of the deep Southern Ocean occupied by carbon-rich Circumpolar Deep Waters sourced from the Pacific Ocean, conducive for lowering atmospheric CO2. During the last deglaciation, Antarctic Bottom Water expanded in two steps coinciding with Antarctic warming. This expansion drove Southern Ocean destratification, which possibly contributed to contemporaneous atmospheric CO2 rises. Different from the view that the North Atlantic processes dominated deglacial deep South Atlantic water-mass changes, our results indicate only limited influence from northern-sourced waters. Instead, Antarctic Bottom Water dynamics played a critical role in regulating deep ocean circulation and thereby carbon exchange between the deep Southern Ocean and the atmosphere.

Here, authors report a universal synthesis approach for layered transition-metal oxides by updating the conventional solid-state reaction with only dicyandiamide introduced. 
 Manganese-rich layered transition-metal oxides are of great interests as positive electrodes for sodium-ion batteries considering their high specific capacity and operating voltage. However, it remains challenging to synthesize layered transition-metal oxides with high stability and rapid ion-migration kinetics. Herein, we develop a straightforward and universal synthesis approach for P2-type layered transition-metal oxides by simply updating the conventional solid-state reaction with only additional dicyandiamide introduced. We reveal the ammonia released successfully restrains the irreversible oxygen redox for stabilizing cationic migration and decreases the crystallization temperature for high-quality structure formation. The effectively suppressed Jahn-Teller distortion and facilitated Na+ transport kinetics therefore endow Na1/2MnO2 with overall performance enhancement, including a 6.7-fold improvement in rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. Similar performance enhancements are also found in other manganese-based layered transition-metal oxides, presenting great strategy universality.

 Flexible perovskite solar cells show promise in photovoltaics due to their high energy-to-power efficiency and adaptability, making them a top choice for third-generation thin-film solar applications. However, the inherent defect and mechanical fragility of polycrystalline films posed a challenge that limited their photovoltaic and mechanical performance. Here, the nanomechanical properties of perovskite films are regulated to varying degrees by introducing metal chelates. Specifically, the metal chelates are embedded into the grain boundaries of perovskite, thereby creating a uniformly distributed tensile strain field. Through nanomechanical investigations of the tensile strain-induced modifications in the microstructure and photovoltaic performance of perovskite films, the flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.47%. This regulation strategy not only focuses on the nanomechanical properties of perovskite films but also reveals the correlation between the physical properties and the mechanical flexibility of perovskite solar cells.

 Reversible metal electrodeposition-based electrochromic devices (RMEDs) with broadband regulation manifest great promises as smart windows to increase building energy efficiency. However, manufacturing durable and scalable RMEDs at an agreeable cost is still challenged by the limited reversibility of interfacial plating (tinting)/stripping (bleaching). Here, we report a quasi-solid-state hydrogel electrolyte with well-tuned Cu:Zn ratio and pH values to achieve highly reversible CuZn-RMEDs. The dual-metal CuZn electrolyte ensures staged nucleation and homogeneous CuZn growth, and the appropriate pH guarantees effective stripping of CuZn metal layers, thus attaining reduced metal deposition activation energy (6.7 kJ mol-1), increased coloration efficiency, large transmittance modulation (ΔT = 78% @550 nm), and excellent reversibility (ΔT retention over 90% after 3000 cycles). In addition, the quasi-solid-state hydrogel matrix with abundant molecular chains can inhibit strong hydrogen bonds in aqueous electrolyte, achieving anti-freezing (−20°C) and leakage-free CuZn-RMEDs with fast switching kinetics (coloration time tc = 15.0 s, bleaching time tb = 24.0 s), extended memory effect, efficient thermal insulation, and effective reusability (2000 cycles) of both the transparent conductor and hydrogel electrolyte. The as-assembled CuZn-RMEDs manifest 18% to 33% energy saving across different climatic regions.

Mice lacking TMEM145 develop severe hearing loss at an early age, providing new insights into hearing loss mechanisms. 
 Outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea contain specialized stereociliary structures essential for auditory function. These include horizontal top connectors (HTCs), linking adjacent stereocilia and tectorial membrane (TM)-attachment crowns (ACs), anchoring the tallest stereocilia to the TM. The known molecular components of these structures, such as stereocilin, otogelin, otogelin-like, and tubby, lack transmembrane domains, suggesting the existence of anchoring proteins. This study identifies TMEM145, a transmembrane protein with a Golgi dynamics domain, as a crucial OHC stereocilia component. TMEM145 is expressed in both OHCs and spiral ganglion neurons, with specific localization to TM-ACs and HTCs in OHCs. Tmem145 knockout (KO) mice exhibit profound hearing impairment at 3 weeks of age, with complete loss of distortion product otoacoustic emissions, indicating OHC dysfunction. Immunostaining and scanning electron microscopy reveal the absence of TM-ACs and HTCs in Tmem145 KO mice. In heterologous cell systems, TMEM145 interacts with stereocilin and tubby, facilitating their extracellular secretion. TMEM145 is undetectable in Stereocilin KO and tubby mutant mice, indicating interdependence among these proteins. These findings establish TMEM145 as an essential membrane protein for the structural integrity of OHC stereocilia, providing insights into the molecular architecture of cochlear hair cells and their role in auditory function.

Here, authors reveal the structural basis of PGE2 recognition and transport by PGT transporter. 
 Prostaglandins (PGs) are bioactive lipids that regulate inflammation, reproduction, and vasopermeability. Timely clearance of excessive PGs is critical to prevent potential damages caused by prolonged signalling. The high-affinity prostaglandin transporter (PGT) plays an essential role in this termination process by efficiently re-uptaking PGs into cells. Here, we report human PGT structures in different oligomerization and substrate-binding states. Beyond the canonical MFS-fold, PGT harbours a cystine-rich extracellular segment that incorporates a Kazal-like domain crucial for PGT localization and activity. Two distinct PGE2-bound structures revealed essential elements for substrate recognition, elucidating a PGE2-flipping process during the multi-stop translocation cycle. Notably, our data suggest that PGT may dimerize in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs. This dimerization would likely increase the mobility of the extracellular region and induces a profound rotation of the C-domain transmembrane helices, an interesting observation for MFS transporters. These functionally distinct snapshots thus shed light on prostaglandin clearance and reveal intriguing features of MFS transporters.

This suggests that prediction accuracy alone does not necessarily translate into real-world clinical impact. 
 Emergency department (ED) crowding necessitates rapid, accurate risk stratification to optimize care and resource allocation. Traditional clinical prediction tools like NEWS, APACHE II, and SOFA score have limited generalizability or rely on extensive inputs, including vitals. We developed RISKINDEX, a machine-learning tool predicting 31-day mortality using routine laboratory values, age, and sex. To evaluate the clinical impact of a machine learning–based risk score in routine care, we conducted an investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial (MARS-ED) at the Maastricht University Medical Center+ ED. Adult patients ( ≥ 18 years) assessed by an internal medicine specialist and with ≥4 laboratory tests were eligible. Patients were randomized 1:1 using computer-generated permuted blocks to standard care (n = 659) or standard care plus access to the RISKINDEX (n = 644). No blinding was possible because physicians needed to view the RISKINDEX. The primary outcomes for this study were the prognostic accuracy for 31-day mortality and clinical impact of the RISKINDEX. In total, 1303 participants were analyzed. RISKINDEX’s prognostic accuracy matched or outperformed clinical intuition (AUROC 0.84 vs. 0.73–0.76) and was statistically higher than NEWS, APACHE II, and SOFA prediction tools (AUROC 0.65–0.75). RISKINDEX predictions aligned with clinicians’ expectations in only about half of cases, with highest discordance among less experienced physicians. Despite its prognostic accuracy, the RISKINDEX did not alter treatment plans (1/644 changes; 0.16%) or clinical outcomes, and clinicians perceived low added value. No adverse events related to the intervention occurred, and recruitment was completed as planned. These findings show that prognostic accuracy alone is insufficient to achieve clinical impact in the ED and that user-centered, actionable model design is needed to ensure relevance, trust, and responsiveness.

 A microscopic mechanism for chiral p-wave superconductivity from Coulomb repulsion is proposed for spin- and valley-polarized state of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. The superconducting instability arises when strong Thomas-Fermi screening of the Coulomb potential allows Friedel oscillations to take over – leading to an effective attraction on length scales below the Fermi wavelength. The superconducting critical temperature is largest at low density below a Lifshitz transition to an annular Fermi sea, where the additional pocket strongly enhances Thomas-Fermi screening. The Lifshitz transition also marks a topological phase transition from a trivial to a topological superconducting phase hosting Majorana fermions. The chirality of the superconducting order parameter is selected by the chirality of the valley-polarized Bloch electrons. Our results are in reasonable agreement with observations in a recent experiment on tetralayer graphene.

 Low-cost air quality sensors have shown great promise as a complement to high-cost reference and equivalent methods. Though not currently as accurate, their low barrier of entry and smaller form factor allow them to be deployed in greater numbers, thus enabling air quality measurements to be made at a far higher spatial and temporal resolution than previously possible. However, their measurements require corrections as they suffer from both short-term biases (e.g., changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity), and long-term measurement drift due to degradation. Many studies have focused on calibration and re-calibration of sensors, but fewer focus on correcting pre-calibrated sensor measurements. Correcting measurements is a likely scenario for people buying off-the-shelf devices, as they will not have access to the raw data that underpins the measurements, such as sensor voltages. Previous studies focused on a small range of correction techniques, without accounting for the variances that can occur between devices or locations. This work aimed to perform a comprehensive assessment of different correction techniques applied to air quality sensor systems. More than 470,000 unique measurement corrections were tested across two sites to determine best practices for correction campaigns going forward, resulting in a far more robust study than previous works. It highlights the large variances in results that occurred between sites, particularly for NO2, with results often more impacted by device type and location than the regression technique used. Simpler linear models were also found to perform just as well as, and sometimes better than, more complex non-parametric techniques. This study highlights that, though a strong focus is often put on comparing different regression methods, the choice of technique has less impact than the configuration of the device or the conditions of the co-location site. Therefore, future studies should focus less on small-scale comparisons of regression techniques and more on how to improve the transferability and applicability of results from a co-location campaign to another.

 Arctic amplification weakens the meridional temperature gradient (∂T/∂y), reducing the Northern Hemisphere winter daily temperature variability (Tstd). However, the extent to which Tstd recovers following CO₂ removal remains uncertain. We investigate the hysteresis and reversibility of Tstd under various CO₂ pathways using UKESM1-0-LL. The mid-latitude Tstd reduced during the ramp-up phase partially recovers following CO₂ removal, but its magnitude depends on the region and peak CO₂ concentration. In the low-concentration experiments, Tstd nearly returns to pre-industrial levels, whereas the high-concentration experiments show hysteresis and irreversibility in eastern Canada and northwestern Eurasia. These regional differences are primarily driven by changes in local temperature gradients.

 Cryoconite holes, small water-filled cylindrical pits on glacier surfaces, are crucial microbial habitats and play a pivotal role in darkening the Greenland Ice Sheet, potentially accelerating ice melt. To understand how their morphology influences microbial ecosystems and biogeochemical functions, we investigated cryoconite hole dimensions, microbial communities, and cryoconite characteristics across Issunguata Sermia (Glacier), southwest Greenland. Our findings reveal distinct morphological gradients: cryoconite holes were shallower in the rough crevasse zone near the glacier margin and significantly deeper in the flat ice zone at the glacier’s midline. These morphological differences were strongly linked to disparities in phototrophic community composition and relative abundance, including filamentous cyanobacteria and glacier algae, between the deeper and shallower holes. Furthermore, cryoconite from deeper holes exhibited significantly higher organic content and enriched carbon stable isotope signatures, suggesting enhanced in-situ microbial productivity, despite consistent meltwater geochemistry and mineral compositions across all sites. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that glacier surface topography primarily drives cryoconite hole development, critically shaping localized microbial communities, carbon cycling, and albedo feedbacks. This study highlights the complex physical-biological interplay in glaciers, offering crucial insights into ice sheet melt and carbon dynamics in a changing polar region.
