McBeath,Optimization of Mixed Metal Oxide Electrodes for Chlorine Generation: An Alternative to Conventional Platinum Group Metal Materials,"Dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) are widely used for the free chlorine evolution reaction (CER); however, their reliance on expensive platinum group metals limits their widespread adoption. This cost barrier has driven the search for alternative materials that are both effective and affordable. Cobalt antimonate (CoSbxOy) has been identified as a suitable low-cost and effective alternative for CER, but the synthesis parameters that maximize the Faradaic efficiency (FE) have not been elucidated. The FE of an electrode is influenced by its material properties, which are affected by the synthesis conditions. A factorial design study was used to investigate the effects of electrodeposition potential, charge, and the Sb:Co molar ratio of the plating solution on the CER for CoSbxOy electrodes; XRD, XPS, SEM-EDS, and SECM were used to analyze electrode composition. At a deposition potential of −1.005 VAg/AgCl, 2.5 mAh charge, and 4.28 Sb:Co, the greatest FE was achieved. Electrode surface morphology was likely the driving factor for maximizing the FE, which may be attributed to the rate of bubble liberation from the anode surface. In dilute chloride solutions at neutral pH, CoSbxOy anodes exhibited high stability and comparable FE to conventional Ru/Ir electrodes, highlighting their potential as a durable and cost-effective alternative."

Paglialunga;F. Passelègue;J. P. Ampuero;S. Latour;M. Violay,The Role of Stress Distribution in Seismic Cycle Complexity of a Long Laboratory Fault,"A fundamental understanding of the factors controlling the complexity of seismic cycles is crucial to advance the study of earthquake hazard and predictability. Stress distribution and fault system size play a significant role in shaping complex patterns of seismic behavior. This study examines how heterogeneous loading conditions influence the seismic cycles of a long laboratory fault. They are reproduced on analog material in a biaxial apparatus while continuously monitoring the strain field near the fault. By examining the effects of stress variability on fault behavior, we identify a spectrum of rupture outcomes, from periodic, system‐size failures to complex seismic sequences comprising several partial ruptures. Additionally, the resulting heterogeneous stress distribution significantly influences single events' rupture dynamics, eventually leading to abrupt rupture slowdown and subsequent delayed re‐nucleation. These results provide a framework for understanding the evolution of stress heterogeneity along natural faults and its implications for rupture dynamics and earthquake predictability."

We designed a laboratory experiment to test the capability of DAS to determine borehole flow characteristics, and we show that for the first time DAS can be used to remotely estimate permeability. Optical fiber was wrapped around a bead filled pipe and the pressure drop and flow velocity were measured to directly calculate permeability. A machine learning model using statistical features from continuous DAS estimated the bulk permeability. Fluid interactions with the permeable material demonstrate insufficient resolution using DAS amplitude‐based measurements for estimating pressure drop to infer permeability. Variations in the spectral domain relate DAS measurements to the pressure drop and provide consistent permeability estimates. Resolution with DAS is sufficient to estimate permeability and provides a reliable method to monitor at depth in borehole conditions."

The MVGDM provides accurate simulations by refined resolution and addressing biases in three variables: sea surface temperature (SST), 2‐m temperature (T2M), and 500‐hPa geopotential height (Z500), reducing climatological biases by 72%, 79%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, the MVGDM mitigates the common westward bias in El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO)‐related SST anomalies and significantly improves the simulation of the Indian Ocean Dipole. With high‐resolution simulations and improved representation of multi‐scale physical processes, the MVGDM substantially enhances the simulation of climate extremes, and shows some potential for improving future climate projections."

The Ca+ layer upwelling process was observed associated with strong equatorward neutral wind. The variations of auroral electrojet index, equatorward neutral wind and Ca+ density profile exhibited close correlations, indicating possible driving source from the polar regions.

However, the mechanisms behind this circulation anomaly remain uncertain. Using both observations and model simulations, we show that local sea ice loss and sea surface temperature warming are key contributors, explaining approximately 47% of the anomaly. These processes amplify local tropospheric warming relative to other Arctic regions, enhancing the horizontal gradient in thermal expansion and raising geopotential heights aloft, thereby strengthening the anticyclonic anomaly. Combined with evidence that the BKS anticyclonic anomaly itself drives local sea ice loss and warming, our results suggest a positive feedback loop, where the anomaly amplifies sea ice loss and warming, which in turn strengthens the anomaly. Although atmosphere‐only models cannot fully capture these feedbacks due to the lack of interactive ocean and sea ice components, they underscore the crucial role of local forcing in amplifying the circulation anomaly. These results challenge the view that the BKS anomaly is primarily internally generated and largely independent of sea ice loss. Under continued greenhouse warming, the BKS anticyclonic anomaly is likely to further strengthen, with important implications for climate in the Arctic and beyond."

However, it is also deposited on the ocean surface by dry deposition thereby reacting with the enriched organic material within sea‐surface microlayer (SML) such as unsaturated fatty acids and humic substances. Here, we performed dedicated experiments on SO2 oxidation chemistry at authentic SML sampled from 10 sites in coastal area and open sea of the South China Sea, in dark and under simulated sunlight irradiation. Real‐time measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) formed by SO2 oxidation chemistry were performed by using ultra‐high resolution mass spectrometry. Intriguingly, a total of 104 product compounds were identified in dark whereas 843 compounds were produced upon sunlight irradiation, during the SO2 oxidation of the SML samples. We evaluated the potential influence of the SO2 oxidation on SML under light irradiation as a new marine VOCs source by a chemical transport model. The simulations suggest a significant change of oxygenated VOCs in marine atmosphere over Eastern Asia that potentially alters the budgets of HOx and ROx radicals and consequently the lifetime of methane."

Pierce,Going Off Grid: A Comparative Study of the Lagrangian and Eulerian Perspectives of New Particle Formation Events,"New particle formation and growth (NPF&G) is the process by which ultrafine particles are formed from gas‐phase precursors. NPF&G is the dominant source of global aerosol number with important influences on climate. Most observations of NPF&G events are conducted at stationary sites; however, NPF&G observed from stationary sites is influenced by gradual or rapid changes in the air masses passing over the site, complicating NPF&G analysis. In this work, we use observations and a 3D aerosol model to compare aerosol size distributions at a stationary site (Southern Great Plains [SGP] observatory, Oklahoma, USA) and along Lagrangian trajectories crossing the site. The model simulates the NPF&G events reasonably well at SGP. Using the model to compare the Lagrangian and stationary perspectives, we can explain previously unanalyzable days with some evidence of NPF&G as either non‐event or analyzable NPF&G days. We find most of the unanalyzable NPF&G days are due to isolated and inhomogeneous NPF&G occurring upwind of the stationary site, often in the outflow of urban regions. Finally, we compare formation rates of 3 nm particles, growth rates, and the survival probability of 3 nm particles growing to 25 nm between the stationary and Lagrangian perspectives. Because of the much larger number of analyzable days along the Lagrangian trajectories, this perspective potentially provides more robust statistics and better characterization of NPF&G event extremes. Our method for extracting chemical/physical properties along Lagrangian trajectories from 3D models can be applied to a wide range of science questions."

P. Bierkens;Niko Wanders,Exploring Global Water Scarcity Dynamics Through Causal Discovery and Structural Causal Modelling,"Water scarcity represents a critical global challenge driven by diverse complex interactions between natural and anthropogenic factors. Long‐term water scarcity often results in depletion of water resources in so‐called water scarcity hotspots. To understand the interactions among social, ecological, and hydrological components within these water scarcity hotspots, we applied causal discovery to observational time series of socio‐economic, meteorological, and ecological variables. This resulted in a network representing the causal relations between these variables and Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS). Recognizing the limitations of causal discovery, we supplemented the network with expert knowledge. From this we derived Structural Causal Models (SCMs) that simulate the causal mechanisms influencing TWS trends at the water scarcity hotspots. The resulting SCMs have a variable performance with a median r2 ${\mathrm{r}}^{2}$ of 0.67 compared to TWS observations. The SCMs allowed us to estimate the impact of anthropogenic and natural changes on TWS variability at water scarcity hotspots. Our analysis confirms population growth as the most significant cause of TWS change in hotspots. As such, this study demonstrates how causal discovery and SCMs can enhance modelling of human‐water system dynamics affected by water scarcity, improving the understanding of these systems and potential impacts of future changes on water storage and availability. For future research, more detailed data on human‐water use is needed to improve the robustness of these models. This is essential for developing effective water management strategies to mitigate water scarcity at hotspots."

 Subsidence along expressways and railways poses significant risks to transportation infrastructure safety and environmental stability. Predicting ground settlement enables enhanced understanding of deformation characteristics along transportation corridors and facilitates timely warnings for high risk areas. This study focuses on the area within 50 km of the Jishishan earthquake epicenter, employing InSAR technology to obtain preseismic and postseismic surface deformation maps. Utilizing 35 preseismic and 21 postseismic Sentinel-1A descending orbit images from 2021 to 2024, we derived surface deformation rates through PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR time series analysis. The preseismic annual deformation rate was incorporated with 12 influencing factors including PGA for coseismic geological hazard susceptibility evaluation. A novel Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory model with attention mechanism (C-L-A) was developed for settlement forecasting by integrating deformation rate data. The results show, integrated analysis incorporating InSAR derived deformation velocities and seismic dynamic factors such as PGA significantly enhances geological hazard susceptibility assessment precision. Compared to conventional static evaluation models, the novel methodology achieves a 21 % reduction in the spatial extent of very high susceptibility zones while elevating the hazard occurrence frequency ratio by 33 %, effectively mitigating false alarm risks. This approach particularly highlight extreme hazard vulnerability in areas exhibiting annual deformation rates exceeding 30 mm. Time series InSAR monitoring unequivocally delineates regional deformation patterns: significant preseismic subsidence (reaching 118 mm/year) prevailed across the study area, while the coseismic deformation field (maximum uplift: 7.85 cm) confirms a thrust type earthquake with strike slip components, tectonically linked to the South Margin Fault of the Lajishan Mountains. Persistent postseismic uplift within a 25-km radius of the epicenter reflects ongoing stress adjustment processes. The proposed C-L-A land subsidence forecasting model demonstrates superior performance across critical metrics, including Δx(MAX) = 2.94 mm, MAE = 1.74 mm, MSE = 3.39 mm2, and RMSE = 1.84 mm, outperforming benchmark models (RF, CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM). This architecture effectively captures spatiotemporal deformation characteristics along transportation corridors, with its high accuracy short term forecasts (about 5 months) providing reliable foundations for infrastructure risk early warning systems and disaster mitigation decision support."

 Great efforts have been made to observe atmospheric volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations. However, observation-based VOC datasets at surface level with broad temporal and spatial coverage are still lacking. This gap poses a barrier to understanding the vertical relationship between surface and column VOC concentrations, a critical scientific question limiting the application of satellite observations to infer surface VOCs. To bridge this gap, we developed a multistep deep learning (DL) framework. This framework integrates Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite observations, GEOS-Chem model simulations, and meteorological and geographical data to generate a seamless, daily-resolution dataset of formaldehyde (HCHO) vertical column densities (VCDs) and surface concentrations over eastern China for the period 2019–2022. HCHO was chosen as a high-yield intermediate product of VOC oxidation and a good proxy for VOC sources. The dataset quality was assessed through comparisons with independent TROPOMI observations and ground-based in situ measurements. Our analysis revealed good consistency in the variability between surface and column HCHO concentrations at the annual scale, with correlation coefficients of 0.90 (spatial variability), 0.91 (temporal variability) and 0.81 (interannual trend). Nevertheless, this vertical relationship significantly weakened during summer, a period of peak VOC and ozone activity, due to the reduced sensitivity of HCHO VCDs to meteorological factors. Our analysis further provides useful insights into the seasonality and interannual trends in HCHO concentrations in the studied period. The observation-constrained dataset and its analysis is helpful for improving our understanding of HCHO variability in China and is useful for better applications of space-based HCHO observations."

 On July 10, 2023, at 08:53 UTC, the CA1524 flight from Shanghai to Beijing encountered severe turbulence while circumventing a convective system. A large-eddy simulation (LES) of this turbulence event was conducted using radar observation data. The LES with a 100 m horizontal grid spacing successfully reproduced the temporal and spatial characteristics of the severe turbulence, including the intensity distribution of vertical velocity within the turbulence region. The simulation results revealed that the turbulence was closely associated with a sudden intensification of vertical motion within a local cloud cluster. Analysis of the vertical motion equation demonstrated that atmospheric buoyancy was the primary driver of the localized vertical motion enhancement. The turbulence region featured an upward-extending moist tongue, where converging water vapor condensed into cloud droplets, releasing latent heat and warming the surrounding air. This thermal effect further amplified atmospheric buoyancy, promoting the intensification of local vertical motion. The enhanced vertical motion, combined with downstream mountain waves, jointly facilitated the development of turbulence within the cloud cluster. These findings highlight that the upward-extending moist tongue represents a significant hazard that should be considered during aircraft circumnavigation of severe convection."
