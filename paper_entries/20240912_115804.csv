 We describe the development of Chempath: an open-source pathway analysis program for photochemical models. This algorithm can help understand the results of complex photochemical models by identifying the most important reaction chains (pathways) for the production and destruction of a species of interest in a reaction system. The algorithm can also quantify the contribution of the pathways to the production and destruction of a species."

Leaf,"The foliar uptake of Fe3O4, Cr2O3, CuO, and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) by maize (Zea mays L.) was studied in a lab-scale experiment. The significant increase of Fe concentrations in leaves exposed to Fe3O4 was observed in both stomatal closing and stomatal opening treatments, suggesting the presence of a nonstomatal uptake. In parallel treatments with equal doses of Fe3O4 (∼200 nm), Cr2O3 (∼300 nm), CuO (∼30 nm), and ZnO (∼40 nm) (20–200 μg), the retention percentage of Fe in the leaves (21.0–69.0%) was higher than that of Cr, Cu, and Zn (0.5–14.0%). The steric hindrance effect seems more important for NPs of >200 nm, while hydrophobic surface and negative charge promote the foliar uptake of NPs smaller than 200 nm. The accumulation of NPs in the cuticle was observed through dark-field hyperspectral microscopy. Cr2O3, Fe3O4, and CuO NPs were difficult to penetrate the cuticle. In comparison, ZnO further migrated and distributed within the extracellular space of epidermal and mesophyll cells of the exposed leaf, possibly due to its comparatively higher solubility and hydrophilicity. The findings highlight the potential of the nonstomatal uptake, which might be a critical route for metallic oxide NPs to enter the food chain."

However, studies investigating their high-resolution vertical distribution in sediments from the European waters to the Arctic remain limited. This study examines MPs in five sediment cores from the Norwegian Coastal Current (NCC), encompassing the water-sediment interface and sediment layers up to 19 cm depth. Advanced analytical methods for MP identification down to 11 μm in size were combined with radiometric dating and lithology observations. MPs were present across all sediment cores, including layers predating the introduction of plastics, with concentrations exhibiting significant variation (54–12,491 MP kg–1). The smallest size class (11 μm) predominated in most sediment layers (34–100%). A total of 18 different polymer types were identified across all sediment layers, with polymer diversity and depth correlations varying widely between stations. Our findings suggest that differences in seafloor topography and the impact of anthropogenic activities (e.g., fishing) lead to varying environmental conditions at the sampling sites, influencing the vertical distribution of MPs. This challenges the reliability of using environmental parameters to predict MP accumulation zones and questions the use of MPs in sediment cores as indicators of the Anthropocene."

A Microbiome Perspective","As water reuse applications expand, there is a need for more comprehensive means to assess water quality. Microbiome analysis could provide the ability to supplement fecal indicators and pathogen profiling toward defining a “healthy” drinking water microbiota while also providing insight into the impact of treatment and distribution. Here, we utilized 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to identify signature features in the composition of microbiota across a wide spectrum of water types (potable conventional, potable reuse, and nonpotable reuse). A clear distinction was found in the composition of microbiota as a function of intended water use (e.g., potable vs nonpotable) across a very broad range of U.S. water systems at both the point of compliance (Betadisper p > 0.01; ANOSIM p < 0.01, r-stat = 0.71) and point of use (Betadisper p > 0.01; ANOSIM p < 0.01, r-stat = 0.41). Core and discriminatory analysis further served in identifying distinct differences between potable and nonpotable water microbiomes. Taxa were identified at both the phylum (Desulfobacterota, Patescibacteria, and Myxococcota) and genus (Aeromonas and NS11.12_marine_group) levels that effectively discriminated between potable and nonpotable waters, with the most discriminatory taxa being core/abundant in nonpotable waters (with few exceptions, such as Ralstonia being abundant in potable conventional waters). The approach and findings open the door to the possibility of microbial community signature profiling as a water quality monitoring approach for assessing efficacy of treatments and suitability of water for intended use/reuse application."

In contrast, research on the potential release and ecological impact of microfibers from washable masks (WMs), suggested as an eco-friendly alternative, is currently lacking. Here, we comprehensively investigated the release of microfibers from disposable and WMs of different types in simulated aquatic environments and real-life scenarios, including shaking, disinfection, hand washing, and machine washing. Using a combination of wide-field fluorescence microscopy, He-ion microscopy, and confocal μ-Raman spectroscopy, we revealed that disposable masks (DMs) released microfibers ranging from 18 to 3042 microfiber/piece, whereas WMs released 6.1 × 104–6.7 × 106 microfibers/piece depending on the simulated conditions above. Another noteworthy finding was the observed negative correlation between microfiber release and the proportion of reinforcement (embossing) on the DM surfaces. Microfibers from tested DMs primarily comprised polypropylene (PP), while WMs predominantly released poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and cellulose microfibers. Furthermore, acute toxicological analyses unveiled that PP microfibers (0.01–50 mg/L) from DMs impacted zebrafish larval swimming behavior, while PET microfibers from WMs delayed early-stage zebrafish hatching. This study offers new insights into the source of microfiber contamination and raises concerns about the environmental implications linked to the use of washable face masks."

Utilizing lab incubations, isotope signatures of Hg(0) emitted from mining soils were characterized to quantify the interplay and contributions of various Hg reduction pathways, which have been scarcely studied. At 15 °C, microbial reduced Hg(0) showed a negative mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) (δ202Hg = −0.30 ± 0.08‰, 1SD) and near-zero mass-independent fractionation (MIF) (Δ199Hg = 0.01 ± 0.04‰, 1SD), closely resembling dark reduced Hg(0) (δ202Hg = −0.18 ± 0.05‰, Δ199Hg = −0.01 ± 0.03‰, 1SD). In comparison, photoreduced Hg(0) exhibited significant MDF and MIF (δ202Hg = −0.55 ± 0.05‰, Δ199Hg = −0.20 ± 0.07‰, 1SD). In the dark, Hg isotopic signatures remained constant over the temperature range of 15–35 °C. Nonetheless, light exposure and temperature changes together altered Hg(0) MIF signatures significantly. Isotope mixing models along with Hg(0) emission flux data highlighted photo- and microbial reduction contributing 79–88 and 12–21%, respectively, of the total Hg(0) emissions from mining soils, with negligible abiotic dark reduction. Microorganisms are the key driver of soil Hg(0) emissions by first dissolving HgS and then promoting ionic Hg formation, followed by facilitating the photo- and microbial reduction of organically bound Hg. These insights deepen our understanding of the biogeochemical processes that influence Hg(0) releases from surface soils."

Electrochemical leaching occurs in the aqueous electrolyte for converting solid LiCoO2 into soluble Li+ and Co2+, in which electrons act as reductants to reduce Co(III) to Co(II). Simultaneously, solvent extraction occurs at the interface of aqueous and organic phases to separate Co2+ and Li+. By capturing and utilizing the protons from P507, leaching yields for both Co and Li exceed ∼7 times than acid leaching without solvent extraction. The extraction efficiency of Co2+ reaches 86% at 60 °C, 3.5 V, while simultaneously retaining the majority of Li+ in the H2SO4 solution. The total leaching amount was improved because the organic phase provides protons to help the leaching of Co2+, and the continuous extraction process of Co(II) maintains the low Co2+ concentration in the aqueous solution. The synergistic interaction between electrochemical leaching and solvent extraction processes significantly reduces the consumption of chemicals, enhances the utilization efficiency of protons, and simplifies the recovery process. The leaching kinetics of Li and Co both conforms well to the residue layer diffusion control model and the activation energy (Ea) values of the leaching for Li and Co are 4.03 and 7.80 kJ/mol, respectively. Lastly, the economic and environmental assessment of this process also demonstrates the advantages of this method in reducing inputs, lowering environmental pollution, and enhancing economic benefits."

When SOA mixes with inorganic particles containing transition metals (e.g., Fe), chemical reactions altering physicochemical properties can occur. Here, we study Fe’s impact on the formation and chemical composition of SOA formed via dark α-pinene ozonolysis on either (NH4)2SO4 or Fe-containing (NH4)2SO4 seed particles and aged at varying relative humidities (RHs). Aerosol composition was determined using online extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, providing high-resolution chemical and temporal identification of monomers and dimers in the SOA. At high RH, Fe’s presence resulted in higher particulate SOA mass concentrations (117 ± 14 μg m–3) than those formed in its absence (70 ± 1 μg m–3). Enhanced mass is coupled with more dimers (C15–20’s), attributed to Fenton-driven oligomerization reactions. Experiments with Fe3+-containing seeds showed similar chemical composition and enhanced SOA mass, suggesting a dark reduction pathway to form Fe2+ in the presence of SOA. Overall, Fe’s presence at high RH lowers SOA volatility and enhances particulate organic mass and condensed phased reactions of higher volatility species that would normally not participate in SOA formation, which may be important when considering its formation in air quality and climate models."

CH4 flux was measured in urban Beijing using the eddy covariance method during a summer campaign. With a mean of 152.6 ± 107.9 nmol/m2/s, the CH4 flux was estimated to depend little on the intensity of human activities, with minimal influence from biogenic sources. Emission hotspots with large temporal variability were identified in the study fetch area, which increased the mean CH4 flux by 12.5%. Based on the lack of large, known biogenic sources in nonhotspot (background) areas, we attributed the CH4 flux in these areas (135.6 ± 70.56 nmol/m2/s) mainly to natural gas. Thus, we estimate as an upper limit that natural gas contributes 88.9% to the total CH4 flux in urban Beijing. However, poor alignment between the dominant sources in the inventories and the characteristics of the measured CH4 flux were observed, suggesting substantial underestimation of emissions from natural gas sources in the inventories. A leakage ratio of 1.4% (0.7–2.1%) of consumed natural gas was determined in Beijing. Pinpointing emissions with more granular methods could improve our understanding of the urban CH4 source profile in Beijing."

Furthermore, through concentration analysis and theoretical calculations, the transformation from PPDs to PPD-Qs was revealed to be influenced by the total organic carbon and transition metals present in the dust with Fe3+ and Cu2+ acting as the most effective catalysts. Finally, occupational populations in environments such as auto repair workshops were found to face extremely high exposure levels.

The dihedral angles ranged from 112° to 137°, surpassing the wetting boundary. Our experiments suggest that N removal from the mantle by percolation of Fe‐rich alloy melt to the Earth's core is unlikely. Therefore, besides N loss to space during planetesimal and planetary differentiation, as well as its segregation into the Earth core, the stranded Fe‐rich metal in the deep mantle could be a hidden N reservoir, contributing to the anomalous depletion of N in the observable BSE."

We perform aquaplanet simulations to quantify the impact of different sea surface temperature distributions on jet stream strength, large wave amplitudes and extreme waviness. The responses to warming in the waviness metrics Sinuosity Index and Local Wave Activity are sensitive to the latitude range over which they are calculated. Therefore, we use a latitude range that accurately represents the position of the jet. The uniform warming scenario strengthens the jet and reduces large wave amplitudes. Reductions in meridional temperature gradients lead to weakened mid‐latitudinal jet strength and show significant decreases in large wave amplitudes and jet stream waviness. These findings contradict the mechanism that weakened jet streams increase wave amplitudes and extreme jet stream waviness. We conclude that weakened jet streams do not necessarily become wavier."

While recent laboratory studies underscore the importance of intermediate‐volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) as key precursors to SOA, field observations that recognize the role of both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and IVOCs in SOA formation remain scarce. In this study, we conducted concurrent measurements of VOCs and IVOCs in ambient air at urban and suburban sites in Guangzhou during a PM2.5 pollution event in winter 2021. The results reveal that between 12:00–15:00 local time, the photochemically adjusted initial concentrations of VOCs at both sites were approximately 7 times higher than that of IVOCs. However, the SOA formation potential (SOAFP) of primary hydrocarbon IVOCs exceeded that of VOCs by over 3–4 times.

However, there is currently no clear understanding of the precise pattern of change and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Since the hydrological response in urban areas is highly sensitive to such rainfall properties, understanding these changes is critical to improving our ability to assess urban flood risk. We use 7 years of high‐resolution weather radar data (4‐ or 5‐min and 1 km) to analyze changes in patterns of rainfall intensity, spatial structure, and storm evolution across eight urban areas within Europe and the United States. The use of the same methodology across the different cities enables a consistent comparison among them. We track convective rainfall events using a storm tracking algorithm and assess changes in rainfall properties in the upwind, center, and downwind regions of each city. We also investigate changes in the frequency of storm initiations, terminations, splitting, and merging. Our results show that urban areas act to intensify rainfall—mostly over them, but sometimes on their peripheries. Overall, larger cities tend to show the largest rainfall enhancements. Our findings highlight that rainfall spatial structure is altered over the urban core; usually resulting in more spatially concentrated rainfall. We also observe increased storm initiations over most cities and increased storm splitting over one. Given that demographic projections show that future urban population will increase, our results point toward an increased future flood risk in growing cities."

 The establishment of an early pro-regenerative niche is crucial for tissue regeneration1,2. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptosis accounts for the release of inflammatory cytokines upon various insults3-5. However, little is known about its role in tissue regeneration followed by homeostatic maintenance. Here, we show that macrophage GSDMD deficiency delayed tissue recovery, with little impact on the local inflammatory milieu or the lytic pyroptosis process. Metabolite secretome profiling of hyperactivated macrophages unveiled the non-canonical metabolite-secreting function of GSDMD. And we further identified 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) as a bioactive pro-healing oxylipin, secreted from hyperactive macrophages in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Indeed, accumulation of 11,12-EET by direct supplementation or deletion of its hydrolytic enzyme Ephx2 accelerated muscle regeneration. We further demonstrated that the Ephx2 level accumulated within aged muscle. And consecutive 11,12-EET treatment rejuvenated aged muscle. Mechanistically, 11,12-EET amplifies FGF-FGFR signaling by modulating FGF liquid-liquid phase separation, hence boosting the activation and proliferation of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). These data depict a GSDMD-guided metabolite crosstalk between macrophages and MuSCs that governs the repair process, which offers new therapeutic insights for the regeneration of injured or aged tissues."

 Chromatin structure is a key regulator of DNA transcription, replication, and repair1. In humans, the TIP60/EP400 complex (TIP60-C) is a 20-subunit assembly that impacts chromatin structure via two enzymatic activities: ATP-dependent exchange of histone H2A/H2B for H2A.Z/H2B and histone acetylation, which in yeast are carried out by two independent complexes, SWR1 and NuA4, respectively2,3. How these activities are merged in humans into one super-complex and what this association entails for their structure, mechanism and recruitment to chromatin is unknown. Here we describe the 2.4-3.3 Å resolution structure of the endogenous human TIP60-C. We find a three lobed architecture composed of SWR1-like (SWR1L) and NuA4-like (NuA4L) parts, that associate with a TRRAP activator-binding module. The huge EP400 subunit harbors the ATPase motor, traverses twice the junction between SWR1L and NuA4L, and constitutes the scaffold of the three-lobed architecture. NuA4L is completely re-arranged compared to its yeast counterpart. TRRAP is flexibly tethered to NuA4L, in stark contrast to its robust connection to the complete opposite side of yeast NuA44-7. A modeled nucleosome bound to SWR1L, supported by activity tests, suggests that some aspects of the histone exchange mechanism diverge from the yeast example8,9. Furthermore, a fixed actin module, as opposed to the mobile actin subcomplex in SWR18, the flexibility of TRRAP and the weak effect of extra-nucleosomal DNA on exchange activity, lead to a different, activator-based, mode of enlisting TIP60-C to chromatin."

 Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the abnormal filamentous assembly of specific proteins in the central nervous system1. Human genetic studies established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration2. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from patient brains1. All diseases studied to date have been characterised by the self-assembly of proteins in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) Types A and B3,4. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP Type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/284–N345 and ANXA11 residues L39–Y74 from their respective low-complexity domains (LCDs). Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11 previously implicated in protein-protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as a ~22 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections showed the co-localisation of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP Type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP Type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases."

 The transport of energy through convection is important during many stages of stellar evolution1,2, and is best studied in our Sun3 or giant evolved stars4. Features that are attributed to convection are found on the surface of massive red supergiant stars5–8. Also for lower-mass evolved stars, indications of convection are found9–13, but convective timescales and sizes remain poorly constrained. Models indicate that convective motions are crucial to produce strong winds that return the products of stellar nucleosynthesis into the interstellar medium14. Here we report a series of reconstructed interferometric images of the surface of the evolved giant star R Doradus. The images reveal a stellar disk with prominent small-scale features that provide the structure and motions of convection on the stellar surface. We find that the dominant structure size of the features on the stellar disk is 0.72 ± 0.05 astronomical units. We measure the velocity of the surface motions to vary between −18 and +20 km s−1, which means that the convective timescale is approximately one month. This indicates a possible difference between the convection properties of low-mass and high-mass evolved stars.

 Intermolecular distance largely determines the optoelectronic properties of organic matter. Conventional organic luminescent molecules are commonly used either as aggregates or as single molecules that are diluted in a foreigner matrix. They have garnered great research interest in recent decades for a variety of applications, including light-emitting diodes1,2, lasers3–5 and quantum technologies6,7, among others8–10. However, there is still a knowledge gap on how these molecules behave between the aggregation and dilution states. Here we report an unprecedented phase of molecular aggregate that forms in a two-dimensional hybrid perovskite superlattice with a near-equilibrium distance, which we refer to as a single-molecule-like aggregate (SMA). By implementing two-dimensional superlattices, the organic emitters are held in proximity, but, surprisingly, remain electronically isolated, thereby resulting in a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, akin to that of single molecules. Moreover, the emitters within the perovskite superlattices demonstrate strong alignment and dense packing resembling aggregates, allowing for the observation of robust directional emission, substantially enhanced radiative recombination and efficient lasing. Molecular dynamics simulations together with single-crystal structure analysis emphasize the critical role of the internal rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecules in the two-dimensional lattice for creating the exclusive SMA phase. This two-dimensional superlattice unifies the paradoxical properties of single molecules and aggregates, thus offering exciting possibilities for advanced spectroscopic and photonic applications.

 Polar molecules confined in an optical lattice are a versatile platform to explore spin-motion dynamics based on strong, long-range dipolar interactions1,2. The precise tunability3 of Ising and spin-exchange interactions with both microwave and d.c. electric fields makes the molecular system particularly suitable for engineering complex many-body dynamics4–6. Here we used Floquet engineering7 to realize new quantum many-body systems of polar molecules. Using a spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states of ultracold 40K87Rb molecules, we mutually validated XXZ spin models tuned by a Floquet microwave pulse sequence against those tuned by a d.c. electric field through observations of Ramsey contrast dynamics. This validation sets the stage for the realization of Hamiltonians inaccessible with static fields. In particular, we observed two-axis twisting8 mean-field dynamics, generated by a Floquet-engineered XYZ model using itinerant molecules in two-dimensional layers.

 DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination is initiated by DNA end resection, a process involving the controlled degradation of the 5′-terminated strands at DSB sites1,2. The breast cancer suppressor BRCA1–BARD1 not only promotes resection and homologous recombination, but it also protects DNA upon replication stress1,3–9. BRCA1–BARD1 counteracts the anti-resection and pro-non-homologous end-joining factor 53BP1, but whether it functions in resection directly has been unclear10–16. Using purified recombinant proteins, we show here that BRCA1–BARD1 directly promotes long-range DNA end resection pathways catalysed by the EXO1 or DNA2 nucleases. In the DNA2-dependent pathway, BRCA1–BARD1 stimulates DNA unwinding by the Werner or Bloom helicase. Together with MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 and phosphorylated CtIP, BRCA1–BARD1 forms the BRCA1–C complex17,18, which stimulates resection synergistically to an even greater extent. A mutation in phosphorylated CtIP (S327A), which disrupts its binding to the BRCT repeats of BRCA1 and hence the integrity of the BRCA1–C complex19–21, inhibits resection, showing that BRCA1–C is a functionally integrated ensemble. Whereas BRCA1–BARD1 stimulates resection in DSB repair, it paradoxically also protects replication forks from unscheduled degradation upon stress, which involves a homologous recombination-independent function of the recombinase RAD51 (refs. 4–6,8). We show that in the presence of RAD51, BRCA1–BARD1 instead inhibits DNA degradation. On the basis of our data, the presence and local concentration of RAD51 might determine the balance between the pronuclease and the DNA protection functions of BRCA1–BARD1 in various physiological contexts.

 Layer 5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons are present across neocortical areas and send axons to multiple subcortical targets1–6. Two cardinal subtypes exist7,8: (1) Slco2a1-expressing neurons (ETdist), which predominate in the motor cortex and project distally to the pons, medulla and spinal cord; and (2) Nprs1- or Hpgd-expressing neurons (ETprox), which predominate in the visual cortex and project more proximally to the pons and thalamus. An understanding of how area-specific ETdist and ETprox emerge during development is important because they are critical for fine motor skills and are susceptible to spinal cord injury and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis9–12. Here, using cross-areal mapping of axonal projections in the mouse neocortex, we identify the subtype-specific developmental dynamics of ET neurons. Whereas subsets of ETprox emerge by pruning of ETdist axons, others emerge de novo. We outline corresponding subtype-specific developmental transcriptional programs using single-nucleus sequencing. Leveraging these findings, we use postnatal in vivo knockdown of subtype-specific transcription factors to reprogram ET neuron connectivity towards more proximal targets. Together, these results show the functional transcriptional programs driving ET neuron diversity and uncover cell subtype-specific gene regulatory networks that can be manipulated to direct target specificity in motor corticofugal pathways.

Neuromorphic hardware promises greatly improved space and energy efficiency for AI but is presently only capable of low-accuracy operations, such as inferencing in neural networks3–5.

Here we introduce an analog molecular memristor based on a Ru-complex of an azo-aromatic ligand with 14-bit resolution. Precise kinetic control over a transition between two thermodynamically stable molecular electronic states facilitates 16,520 distinct analog conductance levels, which can be linearly and symmetrically updated or written individually in one time step, substantially simplifying the weight update procedure over existing neuromorphic platforms3. The circuit elements are unidirectional, facilitating a selector-less 64 × 64 crossbar-based dot-product engine that enables vector–matrix multiplication, including Fourier transform, in a single time step.

 The ability to sequence single protein molecules in their native, full-length form would enable a more comprehensive understanding of proteomic diversity. Current technologies, however, are limited in achieving this goal1,2. Here, we establish a method for the long-range, single-molecule reading of intact protein strands on a commercial nanopore sensor array. By using the ClpX unfoldase to ratchet proteins through a CsgG nanopore3,4, we provide single-molecule evidence that ClpX translocates substrates in two-residue steps. This mechanism achieves sensitivity to single amino acids on synthetic protein strands hundreds of amino acids in length, enabling the sequencing of combinations of single-amino-acid substitutions and the mapping of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. To enhance classification accuracy further, we demonstrate the ability to reread individual protein molecules multiple times, and we explore the potential for highly accurate protein barcode sequencing. Furthermore, we develop a biophysical model that can simulate raw nanopore signals a priori on the basis of residue volume and charge, enhancing the interpretation of raw signal data. Finally, we apply these methods to examine full-length, folded protein domains for complete end-to-end analysis.

 The biological pump supplies carbon to the oceans’ interior, driving long-term carbon sequestration and providing energy for deep-sea ecosystems1,2. Its efficiency is set by transformations of newly formed particles in the euphotic zone, followed by vertical flux attenuation via mesopelagic processes3. Depth attenuation of the particulate organic carbon (POC) flux is modulated by multiple processes involving zooplankton and/or microbes4,5. Nevertheless, it continues to be mainly parameterized using an empirically derived relationship, the ‘Martin curve’6. The derived power-law exponent is the standard metric used to compare flux attenuation patterns across oceanic provinces7,8. Here we present in situ experimental findings from C-RESPIRE9, a dual particle interceptor and incubator deployed at multiple mesopelagic depths, measuring microbially mediated POC flux attenuation. We find that across six contrasting oceanic regimes, representing a 30-fold range in POC flux, degradation by particle-attached microbes comprised 7–29 per cent of flux attenuation, implying a more influential role for zooplankton in flux attenuation. Microbial remineralization, normalized to POC flux, ranged by 20-fold across sites and depths, with the lowest rates at high POC fluxes. Vertical trends, of up to threefold changes, were linked to strong temperature gradients at low-latitude sites. In contrast, temperature played a lesser role at mid- and high-latitude sites, where vertical trends may be set jointly by particle biochemistry, fragmentation and microbial ecophysiology. This deconstruction of the Martin curve reveals the underpinning mechanisms that drive microbially mediated POC flux attenuation across oceanic provinces.

 Rapa Nui (also known as Easter Island) is one of the most isolated inhabited places in the world. It has captured the imagination of many owing to its archaeological record, which includes iconic megalithic statues called moai1. Two prominent contentions have arisen from the extensive study of Rapa Nui. First, the history of the Rapanui has been presented as a warning tale of resource overexploitation that would have culminated in a major population collapse—the ‘ecocide’ theory2–4. Second, the possibility of trans-Pacific voyages to the Americas pre-dating European contact is still debated5–7. Here, to address these questions, we reconstructed the genomic history of the Rapanui on the basis of 15 ancient Rapanui individuals that we radiocarbon dated (1670–1950 ce) and whole-genome sequenced (0.4–25.6×). We find that these individuals are Polynesian in origin and most closely related to present-day Rapanui, a finding that will contribute to repatriation efforts. Through effective population size reconstructions and extensive population genetics simulations, we reject a scenario involving a severe population bottleneck during the 1600s, as proposed by the ecocide theory. Furthermore, the ancient and present-day Rapanui carry similar proportions of Native American admixture (about 10%). Using a Bayesian approach integrating genetic and radiocarbon dates, we estimate that this admixture event occurred about 1250–1430 ce. An analysis of 15 ancient genomes from individuals dating to AD 1670–1950 from Rapa Nui (also known as Easter Island) addresses questions about the population history of the island."

 Parasitoid wasps are exceptionally diverse and use specialized adaptations capable of manipulating the physiology and behaviour of host organisms1. In more than two centuries since the first records of Drosophila-parasitizing wasps, nearly 200 described and provisional parasitoid species of drosophilids have been identified2. These include endoparasitoids and ectoparasitoids, as well as species attacking larval and pupal hosts3. Despite a deep history of research attention and remarkable biodiversity, a wasp species that attacks and develops inside the adult stage of a fly host has not been described previously. Here we report the discovery of a wasp species that infects the adult stage of fruit flies in the genus Drosophila, including one of the most deeply studied model organisms in biology, Drosophila melanogaster. Notably, this wasp can be easily collected from backyard fly baits and has a broad geographic distribution throughout the eastern USA. We document its life history and unique host interactions, including egg-laying into and larval emergence from adult flies, and provide protocols to raise wasps from wild-caught host flies. Our results emphasize the need for ongoing research investment in insect biodiversity and systematics. As parasitoid research continues to uncover unusual biology and supports fundamental mechanistic insights into immunity4, metabolism5, ecology6, evolution7–9 and behaviour10–12, we anticipate that this wasp’s association with the laboratory model organism, D. melanogaster, will provide new research opportunities across the life sciences.

 Any electrical signal propagating in a metallic conductor loses amplitude due to the natural resistance of the metal. Compensating for such losses presently requires repeatedly breaking the conductor and interposing amplifiers that consume and regenerate the signal. This century-old primitive severely constrains the design and performance of modern interconnect-dense chips1. Here we present a fundamentally different primitive based on semi-stable edge of chaos (EOC)2,3, a long-theorized but experimentally elusive regime that underlies active (self-amplifying) transmission in biological axons4,5. By electrically accessing the spin crossover in LaCoO3, we isolate semi-stable EOC, characterized by small-signal negative resistance and amplification of perturbations6,7. In a metallic line atop a medium biased at EOC, a signal input at one end exits the other end amplified, without passing through a separate amplifying component. While superficially resembling superconductivity, active transmission offers controllably amplified time-varying small-signal propagation at normal temperature and pressure, but requires an electrically energized EOC medium. Operando thermal mapping reveals the mechanism of amplification—bias energy of the EOC medium, instead of fully dissipating as heat, is partly used to amplify signals in the metallic line, thereby enabling spatially continuous active transmission, which could transform the design and performance of complex electronic chips. A method using semi-stable edge of chaos in LaCoO3 enables continuous signal amplification in metallic conductors without separate amplifiers, potentially revolutionizing electronic chip design."

 Radiocarbon (14C) is essential for creating chronologies to study the timings and drivers of pivotal events in human history and the Earth system over the past 55,000 years. It is also a fundamental proxy for investigating solar processes, including the potential of the Sun for extreme activity. Until now, fluctuations in past atmospheric 14C levels have limited the dating precision possible using radiocarbon. However, the discovery of solar super-storms known as extreme solar particle events (ESPEs) has driven a series of advances with the potential to transform the calendar-age precision of radiocarbon dating. Organic materials containing unique 14C ESPE signatures can now be dated to annual precision. In parallel, the search for further storms using high-precision annual 14C measurements has revealed fine-scaled variations that can be used to improve calendar-age precision, even in periods that lack ESPEs. Furthermore, the newly identified 14C fluctuations provide unprecedented insight into solar variability and the carbon cycle. Here, we review the current state of knowledge and share our insights into these rapidly developing, diverse research fields. We identify links between radiocarbon, archaeology, solar physics and Earth science to stimulate transdisciplinary collaboration, and we propose how researchers can take advantage of these recent developments.

This is essential for the fundamental studies of physics as well as practical applications such as precision spectroscopy4–7, ultracold gases with quantum statistical properties8–10 and quantum computing. In laser cooling, atoms are slowed to otherwise unattainable velocities through repeated cycles of laser photon absorption and spontaneous emission in random directions. Simple systems can serve as rigorous testing grounds for fundamental physics—one such case is the purely leptonic positronium11,12, an exotic atom comprising an electron and its antiparticle, the positron. Laser cooling of positronium, however, has hitherto remained unrealized. Here we demonstrate the one-dimensional laser cooling of positronium. An innovative laser system emitting a train of broadband pulses with successively increasing central frequencies was used to overcome major challenges posed by the short positronium lifetime and the effects of Doppler broadening and recoil. One-dimensional chirp cooling was used to cool a portion of the dilute positronium gas to a velocity distribution of approximately 1 K in 100 ns. A major advancement in the field of low-temperature fundamental physics of antimatter, this study on a purely leptonic system complements work on antihydrogen13, a hadron-containing exotic atom.

 SAR11 bacteria are the most abundant microorganisms in the surface ocean1 and have global biogeochemical importance2–4. To thrive in their competitive oligotrophic environment, these bacteria rely heavily on solute-binding proteins that facilitate uptake of specific substrates via membrane transporters5,6. The functions and properties of these transport proteins are key factors in the assimilation of dissolved organic matter and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients in the ocean, but they have remained largely inaccessible to experimental investigation. Here we performed genome-wide experimental characterization of all solute-binding proteins in a prototypical SAR11 bacterium, revealing specific functions and general trends in their properties that contribute to the success of SAR11 bacteria in oligotrophic environments. We found that the solute-binding proteins of SAR11 bacteria have extremely high binding affinity (dissociation constant >20 pM) and high binding specificity, revealing molecular mechanisms of oligotrophic adaptation. Our functional data have uncovered new carbon sources for SAR11 bacteria and enable accurate biogeographical analysis of SAR11 substrate uptake capabilities throughout the ocean.

 Reliable control of the conductivity and its polarity in semiconductors is at the heart of modern electronics1–7, and has led to key inventions including diodes, transistors, solar cells, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and semiconductor lasers. For archetypal semiconductors such as Si and GaN, positive (p)- and negative (n)-type conductivities are achieved through the doping of electron-accepting and electron-donating elements into the crystal lattices, respectively1–6. For halide perovskites, which are an emerging class of semiconductors, mechanisms for reliably controlling charge conduction behaviours while maintaining high optoelectronic qualities are yet to be discovered. Here we report that the p- and n-type characteristics in a wide-bandgap perovskite semiconductor can be adjusted by incorporating a phosphonic acid molecular dopant with strong electron-withdrawing abilities. The resultant carrier concentrations were more than 1013 cm−3 for the p- and n-type samples, with Hall coefficients ranging from −0.5 m3 C−1 (n-type) to 0.6 m3 C−1 (p-type). A shift of the Fermi level across the bandgap was observed. Importantly, the transition from n- to p-type conductivity was achieved while retaining high photoluminescence quantum yields of 70–85%. The controllable doping in the emissive perovskite semiconductor enabled the demonstration of ultrahigh brightness (more than 1.1 × 106 cd m−2) and exceptional external quantum efficiency (28.4%) in perovskite light-emitting diodes with a simple architecture.

 Although fat is a crucial source of energy in diets, excessive intake leads to obesity. Fat absorption in the gut is prevailingly thought to occur organ-autonomously by diffusion1–3. Whether the process is controlled by the brain-to-gut axis, however, remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (DMV) plays a key part in this process. Inactivation of DMV neurons reduces intestinal fat absorption and consequently causes weight loss, whereas activation of the DMV increases fat absorption and weight gain. Notably, the inactivation of a subpopulation of DMV neurons that project to the jejunum shortens the length of microvilli, thereby reducing fat absorption. Moreover, we identify a natural compound, puerarin, that mimics the suppression of the DMV–vagus pathway, which in turn leads to reduced fat absorption. Photoaffinity chemical methods and cryogenic electron microscopy of the structure of a GABAA receptor–puerarin complex reveal that puerarin binds to an allosteric modulatory site. Notably, conditional Gabra1 knockout in the DMV largely abolishes puerarin-induced intestinal fat loss. In summary, we discover that suppression of the DMV–vagus–jejunum axis controls intestinal fat absorption by shortening the length of microvilli and illustrate the therapeutic potential of puerarin binding to GABRA1 in fat loss.

 Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality1,2. Elevated intracardiac pressures and myocyte stretch in heart failure trigger the release of counter-regulatory natriuretic peptides, which act through their receptor (NPR1) to affect vasodilation, diuresis and natriuresis, lowering venous pressures and relieving venous congestion3–8. Recombinant natriuretic peptide infusions were developed to treat heart failure but have been limited by a short duration of effect9,10. Here we report that in a human genetic analysis of over 700,000 individuals, lifelong exposure to coding variants of the NPR1 gene is associated with changes in blood pressure and risk of heart failure. We describe the development of REGN5381, an investigational monoclonal agonist antibody that targets the membrane-bound guanylate cyclase receptor NPR1. REGN5381, an allosteric agonist of NPR1, induces an active-like receptor conformation that results in haemodynamic effects preferentially on venous vasculature, including reductions in systolic blood pressure and venous pressure in animal models. In healthy human volunteers, REGN5381 produced the expected haemodynamic effects, reflecting reductions in venous pressures, without obvious changes in diuresis and natriuresis. These data support the development of REGN5381 for long-lasting and selective lowering of venous pressures that drive symptomatology in patients with heart failure. Durable agonism of NPR1 achieved with a novel investigational monoclonal antibody could mirror the positive hemodynamic changes in blood pressure and heart failure identified in humans with lifelong exposure to NPR1 coding variants."

 Human genetic studies of common variants have provided substantial insight into the biological mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing1. Here we report analyses of rare protein-coding variants in 106,973 women from the UK Biobank study, implicating genes with effects around five times larger than previously found for common variants (ETAA1, ZNF518A, PNPLA8, PALB2 and SAMHD1). The SAMHD1 association reinforces the link between ovarian ageing and cancer susceptibility1, with damaging germline variants being associated with extended reproductive lifespan and increased all-cause cancer risk in both men and women. Protein-truncating variants in ZNF518A are associated with shorter reproductive lifespan—that is, earlier age at menopause (by 5.61 years) and later age at menarche (by 0.56 years). Finally, using 8,089 sequenced trios from the 100,000 Genomes Project (100kGP), we observe that common genetic variants associated with earlier ovarian ageing associate with an increased rate of maternally derived de novo mutations. Although we were unable to replicate the finding in independent samples from the deCODE study, it is consistent with the expected role of DNA damage response genes in maintaining the genetic integrity of germ cells. This study provides evidence of genetic links between age of menopause and cancer risk.

 Materials with electromechanical coupling are essential for transducers and acoustic devices as reversible converters between mechanical and electrical energy1–6. High electromechanical responses are typically found in materials with strong structural instabilities, conventionally achieved by two strategies—morphotropic phase boundaries7 and nanoscale structural heterogeneity8. Here we demonstrate a different strategy to accomplish ultrahigh electromechanical response by inducing extreme structural instability from competing antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders. Guided by the phase diagram and theoretical calculations, we designed the coexistence of antiferroelectric orthorhombic and ferroelectric rhombohedral phases in sodium niobate thin films. These films show effective piezoelectric coefficients above 5,000 pm V−1 because of electric-field-induced antiferroelectric–ferroelectric phase transitions.

 Perceptual decisions rely on learned associations between sensory evidence and appropriate actions, involving the filtering and integration of relevant inputs to prepare and execute timely responses1,2. Despite the distributed nature of task-relevant representations3–10, it remains unclear how transformations between sensory input, evidence integration, motor planning and execution are orchestrated across brain areas and dimensions of neural activity. Here we addressed this question by recording brain-wide neural activity in mice learning to report changes in ambiguous visual input. After learning, evidence integration emerged across most brain areas in sparse neural populations that drive movement-preparatory activity. Visual responses evolved from transient activations in sensory areas to sustained representations in frontal-motor cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain and cerebellum, enabling parallel evidence accumulation. In areas that accumulate evidence, shared population activity patterns encode visual evidence and movement preparation, distinct from movement-execution dynamics. Activity in movement-preparatory subspace is driven by neurons integrating evidence, which collapses at movement onset, allowing the integration process to reset. Across premotor regions, evidence-integration timescales were independent of intrinsic regional dynamics, and thus depended on task experience. In summary, learning aligns evidence accumulation to action preparation in activity dynamics across dozens of brain regions. This leads to highly distributed and parallelized sensorimotor transformations during decision-making. Our work unifies concepts from decision-making and motor control fields into a brain-wide framework for understanding how sensory evidence controls actions. Brain-wide recordings in mice show that learning leads to sensory evidence integration in many brain areas simultaneously, allowing sensory input to drive global movement preparatory dynamics, which collapse upon movement onset."

 The presence of disorder substantially influences the behaviour of physical systems. It can give rise to slow or glassy dynamics, or to a complete suppression of transport as in Anderson insulators1, where normally extended wavefunctions such as light fields or electronic Bloch waves become exponentially localized. The combined effect of disorder and interactions is central to the richness of condensed-matter physics2. In bosonic systems, it can also lead to additional quantum states such as the Bose glass3,4—an insulating but compressible state without long-range phase coherence that emerges in disordered bosonic systems and is distinct from the well-known superfluid and Mott insulating ground states of interacting bosons. Here we report the experimental realization of the two-dimensional Bose glass using ultracold atoms in an eight-fold symmetric quasicrystalline optical lattice5. By probing the coherence properties of the system, we observe a Bose-glass-to-superfluid transition and map out the phase diagram in the weakly interacting regime. We furthermore demonstrate that it is not possible to adiabatically traverse the Bose glass on typical experimental timescales by examining the capability to restore coherence and discuss the connection to the expected non-ergodicity of the Bose glass. Our observations are in good agreement with recent quantum Monte Carlo predictions6 and pave the way for experimentally testing the connection between the Bose glass, many-body localization and glassy dynamics more generally7,8. The two-dimensional Bose glass state of matter is realized experimentally using ultracold atoms in an eight-fold symmetric quasicrystalline optical lattice, and the phase transition between Bose glass and superfluid is directly observed."

Ettema,The emerging view on the origin and early evolution of eukaryotic cells,"This Review summarizes key events in the emergence of cellular complexity via eukaryogenesis in the light of developments in environmental and comparative genomics during the past decade. 
 The origin of the eukaryotic cell, with its compartmentalized nature and generally large size compared with bacterial and archaeal cells, represents a cornerstone event in the evolution of complex life on Earth. In a process referred to as eukaryogenesis, the eukaryotic cell is believed to have evolved between approximately 1.8 and 2.7 billion years ago from its archaeal ancestors, with a symbiosis with a bacterial (proto-mitochondrial) partner being a key event. In the tree of life, the branch separating the first from the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes is long and lacks evolutionary intermediates. As a result, the timing and driving forces of the emergence of complex eukaryotic features remain poorly understood. During the past decade, environmental and comparative genomic studies have revealed vital details about the identity and nature of the host cell and the proto-mitochondrial endosymbiont, enabling a critical reappraisal of hypotheses underlying the symbiotic origin of the eukaryotic cell. Here we outline our current understanding of the key players and events underlying the emergence of cellular complexity during the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition and discuss potential avenues of future research that might provide new insights into the enigmatic origin of the eukaryotic cell. This Review summarizes key events in the emergence of cellular complexity via eukaryogenesis in the light of developments in environmental and comparative genomics during the past decade."

 The licensing step of DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination entails resection of DNA ends to generate a single-stranded DNA template for assembly of the repair machinery consisting of the RAD51 recombinase and ancillary factors1. DNA end resection is mechanistically intricate and reliant on the tumour suppressor complex BRCA1–BARD1 (ref. 2). Specifically, three distinct nuclease entities—the 5′–3′ exonuclease EXO1 and heterodimeric complexes of the DNA endonuclease DNA2, with either the BLM or WRN helicase—act in synergy to execute the end resection process3. A major question concerns whether BRCA1–BARD1 directly regulates end resection. Here, using highly purified protein factors, we provide evidence that BRCA1–BARD1 physically interacts with EXO1, BLM and WRN. Importantly, with reconstituted biochemical systems and a single-molecule analytical tool, we show that BRCA1–BARD1 upregulates the activity of all three resection pathways. We also demonstrate that BRCA1 and BARD1 harbour stand-alone modules that contribute to the overall functionality of BRCA1–BARD1. Moreover, analysis of a BARD1 mutant impaired in DNA binding shows the importance of this BARD1 attribute in end resection, both in vitro and in cells. Thus, BRCA1–BARD1 enhances the efficiency of all three long-range DNA end resection pathways during homologous recombination in human cells. Using highly purified protein factors, we provide evidence that BRCA1–BARD1 physically interacts with EXO1, BLM and WRN and upregulates the activity of all three resection pathways."

 We can now measure the connectivity of every neuron in a neural circuit1–9, but we cannot measure other biological details, including the dynamical characteristics of each neuron. The degree to which measurements of connectivity alone can inform the understanding of neural computation is an open question10. Here we show that with experimental measurements of only the connectivity of a biological neural network, we can predict the neural activity underlying a specified neural computation. We constructed a model neural network with the experimentally determined connectivity for 64 cell types in the motion pathways of the fruit fly optic lobe1–5 but with unknown parameters for the single-neuron and single-synapse properties. We then optimized the values of these unknown parameters using techniques from deep learning11, to allow the model network to detect visual motion12. Our mechanistic model makes detailed, experimentally testable predictions for each neuron in the connectome. We found that model predictions agreed with experimental measurements of neural activity across 26 studies. Our work demonstrates a strategy for generating detailed hypotheses about the mechanisms of neural circuit function from connectivity measurements. We show that this strategy is more likely to be successful when neurons are sparsely connected—a universally observed feature of biological neural networks across species and brain regions.

 Early amniote development is highly self-organized, capable of adapting to interference through local and long-range cell–cell interactions. This process, called embryonic regulation1, has been well illustrated in experiments on avian embryos, in which subdividing the epiblast disk into different parts not only redirects cell fates to eventually form a complete and well-proportioned embryo at its original location, but also leads to the self-organization of additional, fully formed embryos2,3 in the other separated parts. The cellular interactions underlying embryonic self-organization are widely believed to be mediated by molecular signals, yet the identity of such signals is unclear. Here, by analysing intact and mechanically perturbed quail embryos, we show that the mechanical forces that drive embryogenesis self-organize, with contractility locally self-activating and the ensuing tension acting as a long-range inhibitor. This mechanical feedback governs the persistent pattern of tissue flows that shape the embryo4–6 and also steers the concomitant emergence of embryonic territories by modulating gene expression, ensuring the formation of a single embryo under normal conditions, yet allowing the emergence of multiple, well-proportioned embryos after perturbations. Thus, mechanical forces act at the core of embryonic self-organization, shaping both tissues and gene expression to robustly yet plastically canalize early development.

 Most C–H bond activations of natural gas alkanes rely on transition metal complexes. Activations by using main-group systems have been reported but required heating or photo-irradiation under high atmospheric pressure with rather low regioselectivity. Here we report that Lewis acid-carbene adducts facilely undergo oxidative additions to C–H bonds of ethane, propane and n-butane with high selectivity under room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

Here, using pump-probe spectroscopy, the authors detect the coherent dynamics of a nuclear and electron spin of a single hydrogenated Ti atom on MgO surface. 
 The nuclear spin, being much more isolated from the environment than its electronic counterpart, presents opportunities for quantum experiments with prolonged coherence times. Electron spin resonance (ESR) combined with scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) provides a bottom-up platform to study the fundamental properties of nuclear spins of single atoms on a surface. However, access to the time evolution of nuclear spins remained a challenge. Here, we present an experiment resolving the nanosecond coherent dynamics of a hyperfine-driven flip-flop interaction between the spin of an individual nucleus and that of an orbiting electron. We use the unique local controllability of the magnetic field emanating from the STM probe tip to bring the electron and nuclear spins in tune, as evidenced by a set of avoided level crossings in ESR-STM. Subsequently, we polarize both spins through scattering of tunnelling electrons and measure the resulting free evolution of the coupled spin system using a DC pump-probe scheme. The latter reveals a complex pattern of multiple interfering coherent oscillations, providing unique insight into hyperfine physics on a single atom level.

 Three-dimensional (3D) tomography is a powerful investigative tool for many scientific domains, going from materials science, to engineering, to medicine. Many factors may limit the 3D resolution, often spatially anisotropic, compromising the precision of the information retrievable. A neural network, designed for video-frame interpolation, is employed to enhance tomographic images, achieving cubic-voxel resolution. The method is applied to distinct domains: the investigation of the morphology of printed graphene nanosheets networks, obtained via focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM), magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain, and X-ray computed tomography scans of the abdomen. The accuracy of the 3D tomographic maps can be quantified through computer-vision metrics, but most importantly with the precision on the physical quantities retrievable from the reconstructions, in the case of FIB-SEM the porosity, tortuosity, and effective diffusivity.

 Several gaps persist in haptic device development due to the multifaceted nature of the sense of touch. Existing gaps include challenges enhancing touch feedback fidelity, providing diverse haptic sensations, and ensuring wearability for delivering tactile stimuli to the fingertips.

 The 2022 Hunga eruptions injected an observationally unprecedented amount of moisture directly into the stratosphere. However, stratospheric moisture can also be indirectly increased following a volcanic eruption, when heating from volcanic sulfate aerosol raises the tropical cold-point temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that a 1 K increase in tropical cold-point temperatures can lead to indirect moisture increases in the stratosphere of comparable or even larger magnitude than observed for the direct injections during the Hunga eruptions. We base our reasoning on first-principle thermodynamic arguments combined with climate model and reanalysis output as well as observational data. We argue that following the next large-magnitude explosive eruption in the tropics, the strength of indirect increases in stratospheric moisture should be quantified using current measurement techniques.

 Extreme weather events cause damage to crops. Quantifying their impact on crop yields in farmers’ fields however remains difficult, as empirical data generally lacks detail, preventing to unravel causal effects from soil and management practices. Here we exploit an observational dataset on potato production on sandy soils in the Netherlands and use a causal method employing a matching strategy to quantify the effect of extreme weather. We provide statistical evidence that drought and high-intensity rainfall in this region have large impact today, explaining 98% of the between-year yield differences. High-intensity rainfall led to a yield reduction of 36% and drought to 13%. Yields highly varied among fields, just as the impact of these weather extremes on individual fields.

 Launched by China in 2021, the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) is the world's first science satellite dedicated to serving the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. In keeping with international aims of this 2030 agenda, the SDGSAT-1 data will be made available for open accee without any restrictions. The Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) onboard SDGSAT-1 has three thermal infrared channels with a high spatial resolution of 30 m. This enables precise monitoring of land surface temperature (LST), which is one of the most important variables measured by satellite remote sensing. This paper presents the development and validation of three split-window (SW) algorithms and the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm for SDGSAT-1 TIS data. These algorithms were rigorously tested through simulation, application, and validation to assess their retrieval accuracy and sensitivity. Simulation results indicate that the theoretical accuracy of the SW algorithms exceeds 1.0 K in most cases, and the TES algorithm shows higher retrieval accuracy with an average LST Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.60 K. With consideration of the comprehensive effects of instrument noise, land surface emissivity, and atmospheric parameter error, the LST retrieval accuracy of SW algorithms remains better than 1.7 K, and that of the TES algorithm is better than 1.5 K under most conditions. The ground validation utilized site data from the Heihe Integrated Observatory Network and the Surface Radiation budget network. The SW and TES algorithms achieved an accuracy of approximately 1.75 and 1.9 K, respectively. Additionally, a cross-validation based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data indicated average RMSDs of approximately 2.25 K for SW algorithms and 3.84 K for TES algorithm. Among the algorithms, the three-channel SW algorithm SW-2 has the best overall performance and is recommended as the LST retrieval method for SDGSAT-1 data. The TES algorithm is also suitable for SDGSAT-1 images because of its ability to retrieve LST and emissivity during both daytime and nighttime."

 Ecosystem dynamics and ecological disturbances manifest as breakpoints in long-term multispectral remote sensing time series. Typically, these breakpoints are captured using univariate methods applied individually to each band, with subsequent integration of the results. However, multivariate analysis provides a promising way to fully incorporate the multispectral bands into breakpoints detection methods, but it has been rarely applied in monitoring ecosystem dynamics and detecting ecological disturbances. In this research, we developed a multivariate algorithm, named breakpoints-Detection algoRithm using MultivAriate Time series (DRMAT). DRMAT can fully use multispectral bands simultaneously with the consideration of the inter-correlation among bands. It decomposes a multivariate time series into trend, seasonality, and noise, iteratively segmenting the detrended/de-seasonalized signals. We quantitatively evaluated DRMAT using both simulated multivariate data and randomly sampled real-world data, including subtle land cover changes caused by forest disturbances (depletions) and recovery (return of vegetation), as well as subtle changes over a broad range of land cover types. We also qualitatively assessed DRMAT in mapping real-world disturbances. For simulated data with prescribed breakpoints in both trend and seasonality, DRMAT detected breakpoints in trend with an F1 score of 85.5 % and in seasonality with an F1 score of 91.7 %. For real-world data in forested land cover, DRMAT unveiled both disturbances and subsequent recovery with an F1 score of 95.1 % for disturbances and 77.1 % for recovery. It detected disturbances in broader land cover types with an F1 score of 84.0 %. We demonstrated that using all-band data was more accurate than using selected bands in breakpoint detection. The inclusion of vegetation indices as model inputs did not improve accuracy unless the original input bands lacked the specific band information in the vegetation indices. As a multivariate approach, DRMAT leverages the full information in the multispectral data and avoids the necessity of integrating results derived from individual bands."

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) are key properties of natural materials essential for scientific analysis. Existing retrieval techniques, however, impede the automatic retrieval of LST and LSE across various observational contexts due to the frequent unavailability of in-situ atmospheric data or blackbody references for atmospheric compensation. To address this, we propose the Inter-Channel Correlated Automatic Atmospheric Compensation (ICCAAC) method, seamlessly integrated with the ASTER-TES approach, enabling direct retrieval of LST and LSE from at-sensor radiance without prerequisite atmosphere and land surface information. ICCAAC innovatively models the inter-channel relationships among atmospheric constituents to streamline the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), which includes the transmittance reconstruction with neighboring channels and the atmospheric upwelling radiance simplification with the atmospheric vertical characteristics, tackling the complex challenge of retrieving ground-leaving radiance. Coupled with ASTER-TES and under the LSE smoothness constraint, along with a lookup table for atmospheric downwelling radiance, this method facilitates accurate LST and LSE retrieval. In controlled simulations, ICCAAC shows a maximum brightness temperature error of 1.6 K for Water Vapor Content (WVC) under 1.5 g/cm2. A spectral sensitivity analysis suggests the optimal performance of ICCAAC for full width at half maximum (FWHM) range extending beyond the channel interval. Applied to real-world airborne data from Hypercam-LW and HyTES, ICCAAC-TES validates its accuracy with an LST and LSE error margin of 1.2 K and 0.014, respectively, corroborated by seventeen distinct ground validations in Hypercam-LW imagery. Comparative analysis with five varied HyTES observation scenes reveals an LST discrepancy of around 1.2 K and notable emissivity textures in LSE images, particularly in mineral terrains. These outcomes underscore the efficacy of ICCAAC-TES, advocating its suitability for automated LST and LSE retrieval in airborne survey applications."

 The acquisition of high-quality reference data is essential for effectively modelling forest attributes. Incorporating close-range Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems into the reference data collection stage of remote sensing-based forest inventories can not only increase data collection efficiency but also increase the number of attributes measured with high quality. Therefore, we propose a model-based forest inventory method that uses reference data collected by a car-mounted mobile laser scanning (MLS) system along boreal forest roads. This approach is used for the estimation of diameter at breast height (DBH) and stem volume at the individual tree-level from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. In addition, we compare the estimates obtained using the proposed method with the ones derived from reference data collected by traditional field inventory of 265 field plots systematically distributed over the study area. The accuracy of the estimates remained comparable regardless of the reference dataset used for estimation of DBH and stem volume. When using the field inventory dataset for model training, the root mean square error (RMSE) of DBH estimates were 4.06 cm (18.8 %) for Norway spruce trees, 6.3 cm (29.6 %) for Scots pine and 8.61 cm (55.9 %) for deciduous trees. Similarly, when evaluating predictions based on the MLS dataset as reference, RMSEs were equal to 3.97 cm (18.4 %) for Norway spruce, 6.12 cm (28.8 %) for Scots pine, and 8.98 cm (58.3 %) for deciduous trees. In general, biases were below 1 cm for most species classes, with the exception of deciduous trees. The accuracy of stem volume also had RMSEs varying across different tree species. For the estimates based on traditional field inventory, the RMSEs were 0.176 m3 (38.8 %) for Norway spruce, 0.228 m3 (52.4 %) for Scots pine and 0.246 m3 (158 %) for deciduous trees. When using the MLS dataset as a reference, the RMSEs were equal to 0.176 m3 (38.8 %), 0.228 m3 (52.4 %), and 0.246 m3 (158 %) for Norway spruce, Scots pine, and deciduous trees, respectively.

 The successful launch of the Sentinel-1 satellite in 2014 brought a large amount of free SAR images to researchers and scholars, and its application in the fields of ocean monitoring, land use change, natural disaster monitoring and emergency response is becoming increasingly mature and precise. The main applications of InSAR can be categorized into surface deformation monitoring and DEM generation. Sentinel-1 was initially designed for surface deformation monitoring; thus, there are fewer relevant studies on the use of Sentinel-1 data for DEM extraction. However, as the only SAR satellite whose data are currently free and openly available and whose data are constantly updated, it is highly important to study its sources of error in the DEM generation process and the accuracy of its products. In addition, the SAR data provided by the Sentinel-1 satellite has the advantages of high resolution, all-day, all-weather, providing a large data source for DEM production. Taking the Ankang area as an example, this paper analyzes the influence of the InSAR spatiotemporal baseline, ground cover, terrain factors, SAR imaging and other factors on the accuracy of the Sentinel-1-extracted DEM using multisource ground observation data to validate its feasibility for terrain mapping in complex terrain. Finally, we look forward to how to effectively improve the quality of Sentinel-1 DEM products to provide guidance and a reference for subsequent research on DEM extraction using Sentinel-1 SAR images and designation of Sentinel-1 C satellite’s parameters."

Macander;Catherine Chan,Predicting plants in the wild: Mapping arctic and boreal plants with UAS-based visible and near infrared reflectance spectra,"•Spectra from six plant functional type statistically differed across types. •Vegetation indices besides NDVI were the best predictors of plant functional type. •Five narrow regions between 400 and 1000 nm composed important vegetation indices. •Weak learners outperformed complex models by balancing sampling bias and variance. •Imagery with 4 cm GSD still included many mixtures of tundra and boreal plants. 
 Biophysical changes in the Arctic and boreal zones drive shifts in vegetation, such as increasing shrub cover from warming soil or loss of living mat species due to fire. Understanding current and future responses to these factors requires mapping vegetation at a fine taxonomic resolution and landscape scale. Plants vary in size and spectral signatures, which hampers mapping of meaningful functional groups at coarse spatial resolution. Fine spatial grain of remotely sensed data (<10  cm pixels) is often necessary to resolve patches of many Arctic and boreal plant groups, such as bryophytes and lichens, which are significant components of terrestrial vegetation cover. Separation of co-occurring small vegetation patches in images also requires high spectral resolution. Our goal here was to test the capabilities of UAS-based imaging spectroscopy for mapping plant functional types (PFT) using high spatial and spectral resolution data over Arctic and boreal vegetation at four sites in central Alaska. We then tested several Machine and Deep learning models of PFT cover using the reflectance spectra. The best models were very simple, balancing both bias (overfitting caused by imbalance sample sizes) and variance (fit to the independent validation data), explaining > 50 % of the independent ground cover estimation and > 84 % accuracy in estimating validation pixels. We explored the impact of spectral resolution on PFT mapping by including vegetation indices and a gradient of narrow (5 nm) to wide (50 nm) band features in our classification models across. Vegetation indices were the most important predictors for classifying PFTs, while including band features improved models, with narrow and wide bandwidths having similar importance but models with wide bandwidths performing slightly better. We conclude that Arctic and boreal PFT reflectance can be pooled across sites for mapping with relatively few labeled pixels. Underfit, simple algorithms outperformed deep learning, at least with these small sample sizes, in classifying PFTs by balancing bias and variance. Future work should aim to increase the number of labeled pixels and the detail of labels to further improve mapping taxonomic precision."

Yang;Hong-xiang Sun;Yidong Chong;Baile Zhang,Three-dimensional valley-contrasting sound,"Spin and valley are two fundamental properties of electrons in crystals. The similarity between them is well understood in valley-contrasting physics established decades ago in two-dimensional (2D) materials like graphene—with broken inversion symmetry, the two valleys in graphene exhibit opposite orbital magnetic moments, similar to the spin-1/2 behaviors of electrons, and opposite Berry curvature that leads to a half topological charge. However, valley-contrasting physics has never been explored in 3D crystals. Here, we develop a 3D acoustic crystal exhibiting 3D valley-contrasting physics. Unlike spin that is fundamentally binary, valley in 3D can take six different values, each carrying a vortex in a distinct direction. The topological valley transport is generalized from the edge states of 2D materials to the surface states of 3D materials, with interesting features including robust propagation, topological refraction, and valley-cavity localization. Our results open a new route for wave manipulation in 3D space."

Although previous studies have identified neural encodings of individual pain components, how they are integrated remains elusive. Here, using a cue-induced pain task, we examined temporal functional magnetic resonance imaging activities within the state space, where axes represent individual voxel activities. By analyzing the features of these activities at the large-scale network level, we demonstrated that overall brain networks preserve both cue and stimulus information in their respective subspaces within the state space. However, only higher-order brain networks, including limbic and default mode networks, could reconstruct the pattern of participants’ reported pain by linear summation of subspace activities, providing evidence for the integration of cue and stimulus information. These results suggest a hierarchical organization of the brain for processing pain components and elucidate the mechanism for their integration underlying our pain perception."

Resulting from advancements in large aperture solar coronagraphy, we report unprecedented maps of polarized spectra emitted at 1074 nm by Fe+12atoms in the active corona. We detect clear signatures of the Zeeman effect that are produced by the coronal magnetic field along the optically thin path length of its formation.

Here, we investigated the effects of parental age on offspring survival and the regulation of TL by examining the telomere-elongating activity of telomerase in the Pacific oyster. We assessed the classical hallmarks of aging in parents at three age classes (young, middle-aged, and old) and crossbred them using a split-brood design to examine the consequences of the nine maternal-by-paternal age combinations on their offspring. Reproductive aging leads to increased larval mortality and accelerated telomere shortening in spats, rendering them more susceptible to infection by the Ostreid herpesvirus. Viral exposure stimulates telomerase activity, a response that we identified as adaptive, but weakened by parental aging. While telomerase lengthens a spat’s telomere, paradoxically, longer individual TL predicts higher mortality in adults. The telomerase-telomere complex appeared as a conservative biomarker for distinguishing survivors and losers upon exposure to polymicrobial diseases."

We examine evidence from California’s aggressive vehicle emissions control policy from 2000 to 2019. We find a 65% reduction in modeled statewide average exposure to PM2.5from on-road vehicles, yet for people of color and overburdened community residents, relative exposure disparities increased. Light-duty vehicle emissions are the main driver of the exposure and exposure disparity, although smaller contributions from heavy-duty vehicles especially affect some overburdened groups. Our findings suggest that a continued trend of emissions reductions will likely reduce concentrations and absolute disparity but may not reduce relative disparities without greater attention to the systemic factors leading to this disparity."
