10.5194/acp-25-4989-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究主要关注长江三角洲城市群的城市热岛效应，探讨天气模式和人类活动如何影响城市温度的日变化。研究发现，天气模式在白天影响较大，而人类活动在夜间影响更大。虽然该研究涉及大气环境，但它侧重于城市气候和热岛效应，而不是直接使用大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['urban heat island', 'temperature patterns', 'synoptic weather patterns', 'human activities', 'Yangtze River Delta']",Tao Shi;Yuanjian Yang;Lian Zong;Min Guo;Ping Qi;Simone Lolli,"The modulation of synoptic weather patterns and human activities on the diurnal cycle of the summertime canopy urban heat island in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration, China","Our study explored the daily temperature patterns in urban areas of the Yangtze River Delta, focusing on how weather and human activities impact these patterns. We found that temperatures were higher at night, and weather patterns had a bigger impact during the day, while human activities mattered more at night. This helps us understand and address urban overheating. 
 Synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) and human activities are significant driving factors of the canopy urban heat island effect (CUHI), and the CUHI phenomenon exhibits a pronounced diurnal cycle. However, to date, there has been a significant knowledge gap in understanding how the combination of SWPs and human activities modulates the diurnal cycle of CUHI. This study systematically analyzed the diurnal patterns of CUHI intensity (CUHII) in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) by integrating multiple source datasets and utilizing objective classification methods. Among all SWPs, type 2 (dominated by subtropical high pressure) exhibited the strongest CUHII, while type 4 (affected by southwestern moisture and southward cold air) had the lowest. In terms of human activities, landscape percentage (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), and anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) showed an increasing trend, with higher values in the east and lower values in the west, coinciding with the spatiotemporal patterns of CUHII. These findings collectively confirm the pivotal roles of SWPs and human activities in CUHI phenomena. More importantly, this paper quantifies the contributions of SWPs and human activities to the diurnal cycle of CUHI using a random forest (RF) model. Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) revealed that SWPs had a more pronounced influence on daytime CUHII, whereas human activities dominated nighttime CUHII. During the daytime, the partial dependence plot (PDP) of relative humidity (RH) decreased more pronouncedly, explaining why type 4 contributed more significantly to CUHII during this period. When the wind speed (WS) exceeded a threshold, PDP rapidly increased, which might account for the higher contribution of type 5 to CUHII during this period. During the nighttime, there appeared to be a threshold for PLAND, beyond which its impact on improving CUHII became markedly more prominent. These results indicated that there was a clear diurnal asymmetry in the modulation of CUHI by SWPs and human activities. In conclusion, this study not only provided scientific insight into the complex driving mechanisms of the CUHI diurnal cycle in YRDUA, but also offered a theoretical foundation for evaluating urban overheating issues and developing effective mitigation strategies."
10.5194/acp-25-5009-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文主要关注平流层突然变暖（SSW）对全球电离层总电子含量（TEC）的影响。研究人员使用机器学习方法建立了一个TEC模型，并分析了1998年至2022年的全球TEC数据，以提取SSW引起的电离层变化。研究发现，SSW会导致全球范围内TEC的昼夜/半昼夜变化增强，尤其是在赤道电离异常区最为明显。论文探讨了可能的机制，如E区发电机效应，并指出该效应可能不足以在高纬度电离层产生显著的TEC变化。总的来说，该研究侧重于空间天气和电离层物理，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测或大气成分分析）的直接关联不大。,"['ionosphere', 'total electron content (TEC)', 'sudden stratospheric warming (SSW)', 'diurnal/semidiurnal variations', 'machine learning', 'E-region dynamo']",Guanyi Ma;Klemens Hocke,Effects of sudden stratospheric warmings on the global ionospheric total electron content using a machine learning analysis,"We analyse the influences of sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) on diurnal/semidiurnal variations of the ionosphere with the global total electron content (TEC) data from 1998 to 2022. We use machine learning (ML) to establish the TEC (ML-TEC) model related to the solar/geomagnetic activities and seasonal change from the TEC data. Subtracting the ML-TEC from the observed TEC, we find a global SSW-induced enhancement in diurnal/semidiurnal TEC variations. 
 A sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is a breakdown of the winter stratospheric polar vortex. It has atmospheric effects in both the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, leading to disturbances in the whole ionosphere. Previous case studies have shown that SSW effects are observed mainly in the low-latitude ionosphere, and each SSW event may have a different effect on the ionosphere due to complex dynamics from solar and geomagnetic activities and seasonal changes. However, the SSW-induced tidal variability in the mid- to high-latitude ionosphere is only identified for several events, and its behaviour is not well understood. Here we analyse major SSW influences on diurnal/semidiurnal variations of the global ionosphere with global maps of total electron content (TEC) from 1998 to 2022. We use machine learning (ML) with neural networks to establish the TEC (ML-TEC) model related to the solar/geomagnetic activities and seasonal changes from the long-term global TEC data. The TEC variations due to SSWs are extracted by subtracting the ML-TEC from the observed TEC. A comprehensive composite analysis of 18 major SSW events shows for the first time a globally SSW-induced enhancement in diurnal/semidiurnal TEC variations. The enhancement is strongest at equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA) crests, moderate at midlatitudes, and vague in the high-latitude ionosphere. It also exhibits hemispheric asymmetry and longitudinal differences. While the semidiurnal enhancement starts earlier and peaks at ∼8 d after SSW onset, the diurnal one starts on the SSW onset day and peaks around 20–30 d after SSW onset. The enhancement of both semidiurnal and diurnal TEC variations lasts for about 20–50 d  after SSW onset. The SSW-related E-region dynamo is likely the dominant mechanism, which is not strong enough to produce discernible TEC variations in the high-latitude ionosphere. ML-TEC does not contain the SSW effect and is thus a valuable reference for the ionospheric state without an SSW."

Northern China contributes a large proportion of CH4 emissions, yet large observation gaps exist. Here we compiled a comprehensive dataset, which is publicly available, that includes ground-based, satellite-based, inventory, and modeling results to show the CH4 concentrations, enhancements, and spatial–temporal variations. The data can benefit the research community and policy-makers for future observations, atmospheric inversions, and policy-making. 
 Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential that is 28–36-fold higher than that of CO2 at the 100-year scale. Northern China notably contributes to CH4 emissions. However, high uncertainties remain in emissions, and observation gaps exist in this region, especially in urban areas. Here, we compiled a comprehensive dataset (available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10957950) (Han et al., 2024b), including ground- and satellite-based observations, inventory data, and modeling results, to study the CH4 concentration, enhancement, and spatiotemporal variation in this area. High-precision in situ observations from Beijing and Xianghe revealed that obvious seasonal cycles and notable enhancements (500–1500 ppb) occurred at a regional background site (Shangdianzi). We found significant increasing trends in the CH4 concentration over time in both the ground- and satellite-based observations and positive correlations between these observations. Anthropogenic emissions largely contributed to surface concentration variations and their increases in middle and southern Shanxi Province and Hebei Province. The posterior concentrations generally agreed well with the surface in situ observations (mean biases ranging from −2.3 to 80.7 ppb), and the RMSE ranges from 110 to 185 ppb, which is in the range from 5 % to 10 % of the XCH4. Moreover, a generally spatially consistent pattern was observed between the results of posterior results and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) column CH4 observations in four seasons. The posterior surface CH4 concentrations (with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.625°) revealed that southern Shanxi, northern Henan, and Beijing exhibited relatively high levels (an increase of ∼ 300 ppb), which were positively correlated with the PKU-CH4 v2 emission inventory data. The inversion results using TROPOMI observations was 24.0 Tg, a decrease of 15.6 %, or 4.4 Tg, compared with the prior EDGARv4.3.2 (28.5 Tg). This study provides a comprehensive dataset of CH4 concentrations and enhancements in high-emission areas, which can benefit at the level of the research community and policy-makers in designing future observations, conducting atmospheric inversions, and formulating policies and at the city level, where high-spatial-resolution atmospheric inversions are highly needed at the kilometer scale."

To better understand these phenomena, we conducted experiments in a specialized climatic wind tunnel. By simulating thermal and wind dynamics, we studied how these winds form, develop, and interact with the landscape. Our findings provide new insights into downburst behavior and offer valuable data for improving models to predict their impacts in a changing climate. 
 Thunderstorm downbursts are windstorms due to intense negatively-buoyant flows produced beneath cumulonimbus clouds. Their study has recently attracted significant scientific and media attention due to the current and projected impacts of climate change. During their vertical descent phase (i.e., the downdraft), followed by a horizontal outflow, downbursts can cause severe damage to both natural ecosystems and built environments. Warm, humid air is lifted upward through natural or forced convective mechanisms, where it condenses into a cumulonimbus cloud. Inside the cloud, the air parcels – now colder and denser than the surrounding environment – sink due to buoyancy. Thermal and dynamic instabilities between the cold air jet and the environment generate a symmetrical vortex, known as the primary vortex (PV), which drives both the downdraft and the subsequent horizontal outflow at the surface. This vortex flow structure can have devastating effects on the ground."

Although scientists have used DGGS in areas like weather and nature, using them in the water cycle has been challenging because some core datasets are missing. We created a way to generate these datasets. We then developed the datasets in the Amazon and Yukon basins, which play important roles in our planet's climate. These datasets may help us improve our water cycle models. 
 Discrete global grid systems (DGGS) are emerging spatial data structures widely used to organize geospatial datasets across scales. While DGGS have found applications in various scientific disciplines, including atmospheric science and ecology, their integration into physically based hydrological models and Earth system models (ESMs) has been hindered by the lack of flow routing datasets based on DGGS. In response to this gap, this study pioneers the development of new flow routing datasets using icosahedral Snyder equal-area (ISEA) DGGS and a novel mesh-independent flow direction model. We present flow routing datasets for two large basins, the tropical Amazon River basin and the Arctic Yukon River basin. These datasets (1) facilitate the adoption of DGGS for hydrological models and (2) provide flow routing inputs for evaluation of DGGS-based flow routing in the Amazon and Yukon river basins.

It includes 1,184 PMCs tracks, 16,630 cloud patterns, and 4,373 wind records, providing fundamental data for advancing our understanding of their development mechanisms. 
 Polar Mesoscale Cyclones (PMCs), particularly their intense subset known as Polar Lows (PLs), characterized by short lifespans of 3-36 hours and horizontal scales below 1,000 km, pose significant hazards to polar maritime activities due to extreme winds exceeding 15 m s⁻¹ and wave heights surpassing 11 meters. These intense weather systems play a critical role in modulating sea-ice dynamics and ocean-atmosphere heat exchange. However, current understanding remains constrained by sparse observational records and overdependence on singular data sources (e.g., remote sensing or reanalysis). To address these gaps, this study presents the Integrated Multi-source Polar Meso-Cyclone Tracks (IMPMCT) dataset, a comprehensive 24-year (2001-2024) wintertime PMCs record for the Nordic Seas. IMPMCT combines vortices tracking algorithms from ERA5 reanalysis with deep learning-based detection of cyclonic cloud features in Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared imagery, while incorporating near-surface wind matching by Advanced Scatterometry (ASCAT) and Quick Scatterometry (QUIKSCAT) measurements. The dataset contains 1,184 vortex tracks, 16,630 cyclonic cloud features, and 4,373 wind speed records, with multi-dimensional attributes such as cloud morphology, core wind speed, and environmental advection wind speed. Validation demonstrates a 70–90 % match rate with existing PLs track datasets while providing more complete cyclone life cycle trajectories, more intuitive cloud imagery visualization, and a richer set of parameters compared to previous datasets. As the most comprehensive PMCs archive for the Nordic Seas, the IMPMCT dataset provides fundamental data for advancing our understanding of the genesis and intensification mechanisms, enables the development of enhanced monitoring and early warning systems, supports the validation and refinement of polar numerical weather prediction models, and facilitates improved risk assessment and safety protocols for maritime operations.

 The Baseline Climate Variables for Earth System Modelling (ESM-BCVs) are defined as a list of 135 variables which have high utility for the evaluation and exploitation of climate simulations. The list reflects the most frequently used elements of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) archive. Successive phases of CMIP have supported strong results in science and substantially influence international climate policy formulation. This paper responds to both interest in exploiting CMIP data standards in a broader range of climate modelling activities and a need to achieve greater clarity about the significance and intention of variables in the CMIP Data Request. As Earth system modelling archives grow in scale and complexity, there are emerging problems associated with weak standardisation at the variable collection level. That is, there are good standards covering how specific variables should be archived, but this paper fills a gap in the standardisation of which variables should be archived. The ESM-BCV list is intended as a resource for ESM intercomparison projects (MIPs) developing requests to enable greater consistency among MIPs and as a reference for modelling centres to enhance consistency within MIPs. Provisional planning for the CMIP7 Data Request exploits the ESM-BCVs as a core element. The baseline variable list includes 98 variables which have modest or minor data volume footprints and could be generated systematically when simulations are produced and archived for exploitation by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) community.

This porting includes the use of OpenACC directives, specific memory management, communications optimization, development of a geometric multigrid (MG) solver and creation of an in-house preprocessor. Performance on the AMD MI250X GPU Adastra platform shows up to 6.0× speedup (4.6× on the NVIDIA A100 Leonardo platform), and achieves a gain of a factor of 2.3 in energy efficiency compared to AMD Genoa CPU Adastra platform using the same configuration with 64 nodes. The code is even 17.8× faster by halving the precision and quadrupling the nodes with a gain in energy efficiency of a factor of 1.3. First scientific simulations of three representative storms using 128 GPUs nodes of Adastra show successful cascade of scales for horizontal grid spacing down to 100 m and grid size up to 2.1 billion points. For one of these storms, Meso-NH is also successfully coupled to the WAVEWATCH III wave model via the OASIS3-MCT coupler without any extra computational cost.

 Geological records of past environmental change provide crucial insights into long-term climate variability, trends, non-stationarity, and nonlinear feedback mechanisms.

This framework enables the implementation of flexible statistical models that rigorously quantify spatial and temporal variability from geological data while clearly distinguishing measurement and inferential uncertainty from process variability. We illustrate its application by reconstructing temporal and spatiotemporal paleo-sea-level changes across multiple locations. Using various modeling and analysis choices, PaleoSTeHM demonstrates the impact of different methods on inference results and computational efficiency.

By integrating the sea ice thickness data into the model, the spring prediction barrier of Arctic sea ice is optimized significantly. The model achieves better skills than the typical numerical model in predicting September’s sea ice extent seasonally. The sea ice thickness data play a key role in reducing the prediction errors of the Beaufort Sea, the East Siberian Sea and the Laptev Sea. 
 The Arctic sea ice suffers dramatic retreat in summer and fall, which has far-reaching consequences for the global climate and commercial activities. Accurate seasonal sea ice predictions significantly infer climate change and are crucial for planning commercial activities. However, seasonal prediction of the summer sea ice encounters a significant obstacle known as the spring predictability barrier (SPB): predictions made later than the date of melt onset (roughly May) demonstrate good skill in predicting summer sea ice, while predictions made during or earlier than May exhibit considerably lower skill. This study develops a transformer-based deep learning model, SICNetseason (V1.0), to predict the Arctic sea ice concentration on a seasonal scale. Including spring sea ice thickness (SIT) data in the model significantly improves the prediction skill at the SPB point. A 20-year (2000–2019) test demonstrates that the detrended anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) of September sea ice extent (sea ice concentration >15 %) predicted by our model during May and April is improved by 7.7 % and 10.61 %, respectively, compared to the ACC predicted by the state-of-the-art dynamic model SEAS5 from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Compared with the anomaly persistence benchmark, the mentioned improvement is 41.02 % and 36.33 %. Our deep learning model significantly reduces prediction errors in terms of September's sea ice concentration on seasonal scales compared to SEAS5 and the anomaly persistence model (Persistence). The spring SIT data are key in optimizing the predictions around the SPB, contributing to an enhancement in ACC of more than 20 % in September's sea ice extent (SIE) for 4- to 5-month-lead predictions. Our model achieves good generalizability in predicting the September SIE of 2020–2023."

This study aimed to investigate the potential of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q to induce endometrial cell dysfunction through nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) and G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) signaling pathways. Fluorescence competitive binding and reporter gene assays revealed that 6PPD and 6PPD-Q selectively bound to ERα (not ERβ) and activated ER transcriptional activity, with the lowest observed effective concentrations (LOECs) of 500 and 10 nM, respectively. Calcium mobilization assays further demonstrated that both 6PPD and 6PPD-Q activated the GPER nongenomic pathway in a concentration-dependent manner (LOEC = 1 nM). 6PPD-Q exhibited stronger ERα and GPER activation potency than 6PPD, which was explained well by molecular dynamics simulation. 6PPD and 6PPD-Q stimulated endometrial cell proliferation via ERα/GPER signaling pathways, mechanistically linked to Cyclin D1/Ki67 upregulation. Furthermore, 6PPD/6PPD-Q promoted endometrial cell migration through an ERα/GPER-regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inflammatory responses. Notably, the LOECs for these functional disruptions reached nanomolar levels relevant to human exposure. Collectively, we elucidated the molecular initial events and downstream key events of 6PPD/6PPD-Q-induced endometrial cell dysfunction, which implied their threat to the reproductive system and provided novel perspectives for their health risk evaluation."

While the magnitude, spatial distribution, and trend of the estimated CH4 emissions align with some previous studies, our results reveal an unexpected seasonal cycle in CH4 emissions from the oil and gas sector, where wintertime emissions are about 40 (20–50, 2σ) % higher than summertime. This seasonality is supported by methane and propane measurements at these same sites, as well as methane isotope measurements made from an independent aircraft campaign over the U.S. Although the exact cause of this emission seasonality is unclear, its spatial distribution indicates that the enhanced CH4 emissions are primarily from natural gas production regions, and to a lesser extent, from natural gas consumption in winter."

Quantitative AOPs (qAOPs) further allow estimation of points of departure (PODs) along a cascade of toxicological events and prediction of final adverse outcome(s) based on early key events. The present study developed a zebrafish-based qAOP model for an OECD-endorsed AOP linking aromatase inhibition to reproductive dysfunction (AOPWiki, AOP no. 25). The model was built based on newly generated laboratory data from a prototypical aromatase inhibitor propiconazole (PRO) and further challenged by another chemical tebuconazole (TEB) to evaluate the model’s performance and applicability. We found that female and male zebrafish have different effects to establish AOP after exposure to PRO and qAOP was expanded and applied to cross-species prediction with fathead minnow. During the environmentally relevant concentrations of PRO and TEB for 21 days, aromatase CYP19, vitellogenin, and steroidogenesis were affected significantly, and the reproduction of zebrafish significantly decreased. The present study aimed to expand the mechanism of aromatase and assembled quantitative AOP in zebrafish and further linked with in vitro, which extended aromatase inhibitor-mediated reproductive dysfunction as a demonstrative case of published qAOP model in fathead minnow Pimephales promelas (AOPWiki, AOP no. 25)."

Despite most microplastics suffering from natural aging, little is known about the effect of aging microplastics (A-MPs) on ARGs dissemination. Here, we demonstrated significant suppression of A-MPs on ARGs dissemination in natural rivers. Although ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were effectively enriched on A-MPs, the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs on A-MPs as well as in receiving water decreased by approximately 21.4% to 42.3% during a period of 30 days of dissemination. Further investigation revealed that •OH was consistently generated on A-MPs with a maximum value of 0.2 μmol/g. Importantly, scavenging of •OH significantly increased the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs both on A-MPs and in receiving water 1.4–29.1 times, indicating the vital role of •OH in suppressing ARGs dissemination. Microbial analysis revealed that •OH inhibited the potential antibiotic-resistant bacteria in surface biofilms, such as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter (with a decrease of 68.8% and 89.3%). These results demonstrated that •OH was extensively produced on A-MPs, which greatly reduced both the vertical and horizontal gene transfer of ARGs.

However, the transgenerational inheritance of these cognitive deficits and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study investigated the inter- and transgenerational effects of ancestral arsenic exposure on the cognitive performance (latent learning) of zebrafish via maternal and paternal lineages and the underlying biochemical and molecular alterations in the brain, including the DNA methylation patterns of cognition-related genes. Adult male zebrafish exposed to dietary arsenic [30, 60, or 100 μg/g as arsenite for 90 days; F0 generation] were crossed with unexposed (control) females and vice versa to generate F1 progeny of maternal and paternal arsenic exposure, respectively. Subsequently, F1 males and females of the same treatments were crossed to generate the F2 progeny of the respective maternal and paternal lineages of ancestral arsenic exposure. It was found that ancestral arsenic exposure induced cognitive dysfunction in F1 and F2 generations of both maternal and paternal lineages. However, the effects occurred at relatively lower levels of ancestral arsenic exposure (30 and 60 μg/g) in the former treatment relative to those (100 μg/g) in the latter. Inter (F1) and transgenerational (F2) cognitive effects of arsenic were associated with concomitant elevated oxidative stress and dopaminergic dysregulation, including repressed expression of cognition-related genes such as genes involved in dopamine signaling and metabolism (Drd1 and MAO) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, DNA methylation analyses revealed that the downregulation of these genes across three generations (F0 to F2) resulted from the hypermethylation in their promotor regions (Drd1, MAO, BDNF).

However, conventional characterization techniques face challenges in providing high three-dimensional resolution and precise compositional analysis of mixed scales, which hinders in-depth elucidation of the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we combined the exceptional depth resolution of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and the superior mixed-scale discrimination capability of thermogravimetry-infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR) to analyze Si/Al scaling, a common issue in industrial RO systems. Under acid conditions, ToF-SIMS measurements revealed Al species enrichment on the membrane surface, attributed to the strong affinity between Al3+ and the membrane. The preferential deposition of Al3+ further facilitated the heterogeneous nucleation of polymerized silica through the electrostatic shielding effect, leading to the rapid formation of a thin and dense scaling layer. In contrast, neutral and alkaline conditions produced a slower-developing, uniform, thicker, and loosely structured scaling layer through physical deposition of supersaturated Si/Al complex scales. TG-IR analysis revealed that neutral conditions favored coprecipitated adsorption-bound Si/Al species (6-coordinate Al) and Si/Al polymers (4-coordinate Al), whereas alkaline conditions primarily produced coprecipitated silica and Al(OH)4−. These findings advance the mechanistic understanding of Si/Al scaling and provide a foundation for targeted control strategies in silica-metal combined scaling in RO systems."

Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) technology has emerged as an effective strategy for pollutant removal, but its application in real tobacco smoke purification and associated health impacts remains underexplored. Herein, we investigated the simultaneous removal of PM and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from tobacco smoke using a PCO purifier. The PCO purifier exhibited superior PM removal, achieving 99% efficiency within 10 min and reducing ultrafine PM concentrations to one-tenth of those observed with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration. The 63 main VOCs, predominantly oxygenated VOCs, were identified in tobacco smoke with the PCO purifier exhibiting over 99% removal efficiency within 300 min. Furthermore, the PCO purifier demonstrated exceptional stability and long-term durability across varying humidity levels and smoke concentrations. The hazard index (HI) was quantified to evaluate the health risks associated with tobacco smoke. The PCO purifier reduced HI by 95% within 120 min, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating exposure risks. Additionally, the major HI was primarily established from four key indicator compounds (i.e., 2,5-dimethylfuran, 2,3-butanedione, n-nitrosomethylethylamine, and isocyanic acid), which reliably estimated the overall health risks during the purification of tobacco smoke.

However, this remains underexplored, particularly in the South China Sea (SCS), where radioactivity is derived from both the close-in fallout of the Pacific Proving Ground (PPG) and the global fallout. Additionally, this region is quite sensitive to climate change. A coral core collected from Xisha Island, SCS, was initially analyzed for high-radiotoxicity 239,240Pu. Approximately 72–84% of plutonium in coral originated from the close-in fallout of PPG through ocean current compared to the direct global fallout. However, the 239,240Pu concentration still remains in background levels and does not show a significant radiation risk. After 1980, a distinct pattern emerged characterized by a “higher” concentration but a “lower” 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio compared to the levels in the open west Pacific. This is primarily attributed to the seasonal upwelling of subsurface seawater on the continental shelf of SCS, driven by the prevailing southwest monsoon. Significantly elevated 239,240Pu concentrations were observed during typical ENSO years 1983, 1988, and 1997. This is due to the elevated temperature, coral bleaching, and expulsion of symbiotic zooxanthellae. After expulsion, zooxanthellae containing higher 239,240Pu compared to skeleton rapidly die, and their debris directly deposit onto the coral skeleton, in contrast to the metabolic way of 239,240Pu during normal years. This finding offers critical insights into ecosystem protection in SCS amid global changes and the potential threat of nuclear contamination."

However, the direct cause of this inverted land‐sea contrast (ILSC) of HPI is still unclear. We find the ERA5 data generally reproduces the above ILSC pattern, although its heavier HPI centers are generally weaker than CMORPH data. Then we find the distribution of convective precipitation (CP) plays a key role based on ERA5 data. The CP intensity centers match well with that of the hourly total precipitation over land areas, which are generally greater than those over ocean; contrarily, the large‐scale precipitation intensity centers are mainly located in ocean.

In this study, we use the ground‐based observations collected at Davis, Antarctica during the Precipitation over Land and The Southern Ocean field campaign in austral summer of 2019 to assess the capability of the high‐resolution regional Unified Model (UM) to reproduce precipitating clouds off coastal Antarctica. We test the new UM RAL3 (Regional Atmosphere and Land 3) configuration with double‐moment Cloud AeroSol Interacting Microphysics scheme and bimodal cloud fraction scheme, running at the spatial resolution of 1.5‐km. We compare it to the previous RA2M configuration with a single‐moment cloud microphysics scheme and unimodal cloud fraction scheme. The RAL3 exhibits marginally degraded meteorological conditions relative to RA2M compared with observations. For cloud properties, the UM regional models can generally simulate the phase, vertical structure and timing of events during the sublimation and precipitation periods. Nevertheless, overestimated ice water path and potentially underestimated liquid water path (LWP) contribute to positive surface shortwave biases and negative longwave biases. The RA2M simulates more LWP, though we suggest for the wrong reasons due to its ice nucleating parameterization.

Site‐scale validations showed that ETFYEDVI generated overall good accuracy (R2 = 0.78, bias of −0.1 mm day−1) across forest, grass, crop, and desert sites. Basin‐scale evaluations further demonstrated the stable and small bias (R2 of 0.96, bias of −22.2 mm year−1) in annual ETFYEDVI from southern humid to arid inland basins. This accuracy was comparable or better than those of four global satellite ET products.

Reliable estimates of the volcanic eruption response as simulated by climate models are needed to reconstruct past climate variability. Yet, the ability of models to represent the response to both single‐eruption events and a combination of eruptions remains uncertain. We use the Community Earth System Model version 2 along with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6, known as CESM2(WACCM6), to study the global‐mean surface temperature (GMST) response to idealized single volcano eruptions at the equator, ranging in size from Mt. Pinatubo‐type events to supereruptions. Additionally, we simulate the GMST response to double‐eruption events with eruption separations of a few years. For large idealized eruptions, we demonstrate that double‐eruption events separated by 4 years combine linearly in terms of GMST response. In addition, the temporal development is similar across all single volcanic eruptions injecting at least 400 Tg SO2 $\left({\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}}_{2}\right)$ into the atmosphere. Because only a few eruptions in the past millennium occurred within 4 years of a previous eruption, we assume that the historical record can be represented as a superposition of single‐eruption events. Hence, we employ a deconvolution method to estimate a nonparametric historical GMST response pulse function for volcanic eruptions, based on climate simulation data from 850 to 1850 taken from a previous study. By applying the estimated GMST response pulse function, we can reconstruct most of the underlying historical GMST signal. Furthermore, the GMST response is significantly perturbed for at least 7 years following eruptions."

Among the most vulnerable 15 countries, India had by far the highest mortality burden, and the United States, Russia, Japan, and Germany were particularly highlighted as having higher burdens within the Global North. Our findings highlight the importance of considering environmental inequality between the Global North and the Global South, and co‐benefits of air pollution‐climate change mitigation during policymaking processes."

 Evidence indicates that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist at the centres of most galaxies. Their mass correlates with the galactic bulge mass1, suggesting a coevolution with their host galaxies2, most likely through powerful winds3. X-ray observations have detected highly ionized winds outflowing at sub-relativistic speeds from the accretion disks around SMBHs4,5. However, the limited spectral resolution of present X-ray instruments has left the physical structure and location of the winds poorly understood, hindering accurate estimates of their kinetic power6,7. Here the first X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observation of the luminous quasar PDS 456 is reported. The high-resolution spectrometer Resolve aboard XRISM enabled the discovery of five discrete velocity components outflowing at 20–30% of the speed of light. This demonstrates that the wind structure is highly inhomogeneous, which probably consists of up to a million clumps. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be 60–300 solar masses per year, with the wind kinetic power exceeding the Eddington luminosity limit. Compared with the galaxy-scale outflows, the kinetic power is more than three orders of magnitude larger, whereas the momentum flux is ten times larger. These estimates disfavour both energy-driven and momentum-driven outflow models. This suggests that such wind activity occurs in less than 10% of the quasar phase and/or that its energy/momentum is not efficiently transferred to the galaxy-scale outflows owing to the clumpiness of the wind and the interstellar medium. Observations of a luminous quasar from the high-resolution spectrometer Resolve aboard XRISM revealed highly inhomogeneous wind structure outflowing from a supermassive black hole, which probably consists of up to a million clumps."

 The pressures humanity has been placing on the environment have put Earth’s stability at risk. The planetary boundaries framework serves as a method to define a ‘safe operating space for humanity’1,2 and has so far been applied mostly to highlight the currently prevailing unsustainable environmental conditions. The ability to evaluate trends over time, however, can help us explore the consequences of alternative policy decisions and identify pathways for living within planetary boundaries3. Here we use the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment4 to project control variables for eight out of nine planetary boundaries under alternative scenarios to 2050, both with and without strong environmental policy measures. The results show that, with current trends and policies, the situation is projected to worsen to 2050 for all planetary boundaries, except for ozone depletion. Targeted interventions, such as implementing the Paris climate agreement, a shift to a healthier diet, improved food, and water- and nutrient-use efficiency, can effectively reduce the degree of transgression of the planetary boundaries, steering humanity towards a more sustainable trajectory (that is, if they can be implemented based on social and institutional feasibility considerations). However, even in this scenario, several planetary boundaries, including climate change, biogeochemical flows and biodiversity, will remain transgressed in 2050, partly as result of inertia. This means that more-effective policy measures will be needed to ensure we are living well within the planetary boundaries. Current trends imply that we will transgress most of the planetary boundaries by 2050; however, ambitious, urgent and universal action to ameliorate climate change and increase resource efficiency can effectively reduce the degree of transgression."

 Signals from the microenvironment are known to be critical for development, stem cell self-renewal and oncogenic progression. Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified1–5, concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies6 to identify LSC–niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine–taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)-driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies. The taurine–taurine transporter axis is a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias."

 Electrochemical CO2 reduction into chemicals and fuels holds great promise for renewable energy storage and carbon recycling1–3. Although high-temperature CO2 electroreduction in solid oxide electrolysis cells is industrially relevant, current catalysts have modest energy efficiency and a limited lifetime at high current densities, generally below 70% and 200 h, respectively, at 1 A cm−2 and temperatures of 800 °C or higher4–8. Here we develop an encapsulated Co–Ni alloy catalyst using Sm2O3-doped CeO2 that exhibits an energy efficiency of 90% and a lifetime of more than 2,000 h at 1 A cm−2 for high-temperature CO2-to-CO conversion at 800 °C. Its selectivity towards CO is about 100%, and its single-pass yield reaches 90%. We show that the efficacy of our catalyst arises from its unique encapsulated structure and optimized alloy composition, which simultaneously enable enhanced CO2 adsorption, moderate CO adsorption and suppressed metal agglomeration. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design of catalysts for high-temperature reactions that overcomes the typical trade-off between activity and stability and has potential industrial applications.

 Precision measurements using low-energy antiprotons, exclusively available at the antimatter factory (AMF) of CERN1, offer stringent tests of charge–parity–time (CPT) invariance, which is a fundamental symmetry in the Standard Model of particle physics2. These tests have been realized, for example, in antiprotonic helium3 and antihydrogen4. In our cryogenic Penning-trap experiments5, we measure the magnetic moments6,7 and charge-to-mass ratios of protons and antiprotons and now provide the most precise test of CPT invariance in the baryon sector8. Our experiments are limited by magnetic field fluctuations imposed by the decelerators in the AMF; therefore, we are advancing the relocation of antiprotons to dedicated precision laboratories. Here we present the successful transport of a trapped proton cloud from the AMF using BASE-STEP9—a transportable, superconducting, autonomous and open Penning-trap system that can distribute antiprotons into other experiments. We transferred the trapped protons from our experimental area at the AMF onto a truck and transported them across the Meyrin site of CERN, demonstrating autonomous operation without external power for 4 h and loss-free proton relocation. We thereby confirm the feasibility of transferring particles into low-noise laboratories in the vicinity of the AMF and of using a power generator on the truck10 to reach laboratories throughout Europe.

Turner,Divergent DNA methylation dynamics in marsupial and eutherian embryos,"A study reports on the DNA methylation dynamics during embryogenesis in marsupials, showing that these differ from those occurring during embryogenesis in eutherian mammals. 
 Based on seminal work in placental species (eutherians)1–10, a paradigm of mammalian development has emerged wherein the genome-wide erasure of parental DNA methylation is required for embryogenesis. Whether such DNA methylation reprogramming is, in fact, conserved in other mammals is unknown. Here, to resolve this point, we generated base-resolution DNA methylation maps in gametes, embryos and adult tissues of a marsupial, the opossum Monodelphis domestica, revealing variations from the eutherian-derived model. The difference in DNA methylation level between oocytes and sperm is less pronounced than that in eutherians. Furthermore, unlike the genome of eutherians, that of the opossum remains hypermethylated during the cleavage stages. In the blastocyst, DNA demethylation is transient and modest in the epiblast. However, it is sustained in the trophectoderm, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function for DNA hypomethylation in the mammalian placenta. Furthermore, unlike that in eutherians, the inactive X chromosome becomes globally DNA hypomethylated during embryogenesis. We identify gamete differentially methylated regions that exhibit distinct fates in the embryo, with some transient, and others retained and that represent candidate imprinted loci. We also reveal a possible mechanism for imprinted X inactivation, through maternal DNA methylation of the Xist-like noncoding RNA RSX11. We conclude that the evolutionarily divergent eutherians and marsupials use DNA demethylation differently during embryogenesis. A study reports on the DNA methylation dynamics during embryogenesis in marsupials, showing that these differ from those occurring during embryogenesis in eutherian mammals."

 Humans have evolved an extraordinarily expanded and complex cerebral cortex associated with developmental and gene regulatory modifications1–3. Human accelerated regions (HARs) are highly conserved DNA sequences with human-specific nucleotide substitutions. Although there are thousands of annotated HARs, their functional contribution to species-specific cortical development remains largely unknown4,5. HARE5 is a HAR transcriptional enhancer of the WNT signalling receptor Frizzled8 that is active during brain development6. Here, using genome-edited mouse (Mus musculus, Mm) and primate models, we demonstrated that human (Homo sapiens, Hs) HARE5 fine-tunes cortical development and connectivity by controlling the proliferative and neurogenic capacities of neural progenitor cells. Hs-HARE5 knock-in mice have significantly enlarged neocortices, containing more excitatory neurons. By measuring neural dynamics in vivo, we showed that these anatomical features result in increased functional independence between cortical regions. We assessed underlying developmental mechanisms using fixed and live imaging, lineage analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing. We discovered that Hs-HARE5 modifies radial glial cell behaviour, with increased self-renewal at early developmental stages, followed by expanded neurogenic potential. Using genome-edited human and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, Pt) neural progenitor cells and cortical organoids, we showed that four human-specific variants of Hs-HARE5 drive increased enhancer activity that promotes progenitor proliferation. Finally, we showed that Hs-HARE5 increased progenitor proliferation by amplifying canonical WNT signalling. These findings illustrate how small changes in regulatory DNA can directly affect critical signalling pathways to modulate brain development. Our study uncovered new functions of HARs as key regulatory elements crucial for the expansion and complexity of the human cerebral cortex. HARE5, a human accelerated region enhancer, modulates cortical development by influencing neural progenitor cell behaviour, leading to an enlarged neocortex with increased functional independence between cortical regions through amplified WNT signalling."

 Here we report on the nearly complete and uncrushed 14th specimen of Archaeopteryx. Exceptional preservation and preparation guided by micro-computed tomographic data make this one of the best exemplars of this iconic taxon, preserving important data regarding skeletal transformation and plumage evolution in relation to the acquisition of flight during early avian evolution. The ventrolaterally exposed skull reveals a palatal morphology intermediate between troodontids1 and crownward Cretaceous birds2,3. Modifications of the skull reflect the shift towards a less rigid cranial architecture in archaeopterygids from non-avian theropods. The complete vertebral column reveals paired proatlases and a tail longer than previously recognized. Skin traces on the right major digit of the hand suggest that the minor digit was free and mobile distally, contrary to previous interpretations4. The morphology of the foot pads indicates that they were adapted for non-raptorial terrestrial locomotion. Specialized inner secondary feathers called tertials5,6 are observed on both wings. Humeral tertials are absent in non-avian dinosaurs closely related to birds, suggesting that these feathers evolved for flight, creating a continuous aerodynamic surface.

 The known fossil record of crown-group amniotes begins in the late Carboniferous with the sauropsid trackmaker Notalacerta1,2 and the sauropsid body fossil Hylonomus1–4. The earliest body fossils of crown-group tetrapods are mid-Carboniferous, and the oldest trackways are early Carboniferous5–7. This suggests that the tetrapod crown group originated in the earliest Carboniferous (early Tournaisian), with the amniote crown group appearing in the early part of the late Carboniferous. Here we present new trackway data from Australia that challenge this widely accepted timeline. A track-bearing slab from the Snowy Plains Formation of Victoria, Taungurung Country, securely dated to the early Tournaisian8,9, shows footprints from a crown-group amniote with clawed feet, most probably a primitive sauropsid. This pushes back the likely origin of crown-group amniotes by at least 35–40 million years. We also extend the range of Notalacerta into the early Carboniferous. The Australian tracks indicate that the amniote crown-group node cannot be much younger than the Devonian/Carboniferous boundary, and that the tetrapod crown-group node must be located deep within the Devonian; an estimate based on molecular-tree branch lengths suggests an approximate age of early Frasnian for the latter. The implications for the early evolution of tetrapods are profound; all stem-tetrapod and stem-amniote lineages must have originated during the Devonian. It seems that tetrapod evolution proceeded much faster, and the Devonian tetrapod record is much less complete, than has been thought. Analysis of a fossil trackway from the earliest Carboniferous of Australia shows prints of toes with claws, suggesting that the origin of amniotes was at least 35–40 million years earlier than previously thought."

 High-capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a critical role as power sources across diverse applications, including portable electronics, electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable-energy-storage systems1. However, there is growing concern about the safety of integrated LIB systems, with reports of up to 9,486 incidents between 2020 and 2024 (ref. 2). To ensure the safe application of commercial LIBs, it is essential to capture internal signals that enable early failure diagnosis and warning. Monitoring non-uniform temperature and strain distributions within the jelly-roll structures of the battery provides a promising approach to achieving this goal3,4. Here we propose a miniaturized and low-power-consumption system capable of accurate sensing and wireless transmission of internal temperature and strain signals inside LIBs, with negligible influence on its performance. The acquisition of internal temperature signals and the area ratio between initial internal-short-circuited regions and battery electrodes enables quantitative analysis of thermal fusing and thermal runaway phenomena, leading to the evaluation of the intensity of battery thermal runaway and recognition of thermal abuse behaviours. This work provides a foundation for designing next-generation smart LIBs with safety warning and failure positioning capabilities.

Through advancing nano-focused synchrotron X-ray probes, here we report the observation of the transition from hcp H2 to a post-hcp structure with a six-fold larger supercell at pressures above 212 GPa, indicating the change of spherical H2 to various ordered configurations. Theoretical calculations based on our XRD results found a time-averaged structure model in the space group

             with alternating layers of spherically disordered H2 and new graphene-like layers consisting of H2 trimers (H6) formed by the association of three H2 molecules. This supercell has not been reported by any previous theoretical study for the post-hcp phase, but is close to a number of theoretical models with mixed-layer structures. The evidence of a structural transition beyond hcp establishes the trend of H2 molecular association towards polymerization at extreme pressures, giving clues about the nature of the molecular-to-atomic transition of metallic hydrogen. Considering the spectroscopic behaviours that show strong vibrational and bending peaks of H2 up to 400 GPa, it would be prudent to speculate the continuation of hydrogen molecular polymerization up to its metallization. The observation of the transition from hcp H2 to a post-hcp structure with a six-fold larger supercell at pressures above 212 GPa is reported, indicating the trend of H2 polymerization through molecular association."

 The mammalian gut harbours trillions of commensal bacteria that interact with their hosts through various bioactive molecules1,2. However, the mutualistic strategies that hosts evolve to benefit from these symbiotic relationships are largely unexplored. Here we report that mouse enterocytes secrete apolipoprotein L9a and b (APOL9a/b) in the presence of microbiota. By integrating flow cytometry sorting of APOL9-binding bacterial taxa with 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (APOL9-seq), we identify that APOL9a/b, as well as their human equivalent APOL2, coat gut bacteria belonging to the order of Bacteroidales with a high degree of specificity through commensal ceramide-1-phosphate (Cer1P) lipids. Genetic abolition of ceramide-1-phosphate synthesis pathways in gut-dominant symbiote Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron significantly decreases the binding of APOL9a/b to the bacterium. Instead of lysing the bacterial cells, coating of APOL9a/b induces the production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from the target bacteria. Subsequently, the Bacteroides-elicited outer membrane vesicles enhance the host’s interferon-γ signalling to promote major histocompatibility complex class II expression in the intestinal epithelial cells. In mice, the loss of Apol9a/b compromises the gut major histocompatibility complex class II-instructed immune barrier function, leading to early mortality from infection by intestinal pathogens. Our data show how a host-elicited factor benefits gut immunological homeostasis by selectively targeting commensal ceramide molecules. APOL9a/b proteins coat mouse intestinal bacteria with high specificity, and genetic abolition of ceramide-1-phosphate synthesis pathways in the symbiote Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron significantly decreases this binding of APOL9a/b to the bacterium."

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed cancer therapy1,2. The efficacy of immunotherapy depends on dendritic cell-mediated tumour antigen presentation, T cell priming and activation3,4. However, the relationship between the key transcription factors in dendritic cells and ICB efficacy remains unknown. Here we found that ICB reprograms the interplay between the STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional pathways in dendritic cells, thereby activating T cell immunity and enabling ICB efficacy. Mechanistically, STAT3 restrained the JAK2 and STAT5 transcriptional pathway, determining the fate of dendritic cell function. As STAT3 is often activated in the tumour microenvironment5, we developed two distinct PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimera) degraders of STAT3, SD-36 and SD-2301. STAT3 degraders effectively degraded STAT3 in dendritic cells and reprogrammed the dendritic cell–transcriptional network towards immunogenicity. Furthermore, STAT3 degrader monotherapy was efficacious in treatment of advanced tumours and ICB-resistant tumours without toxicity in mice. Thus, the crosstalk between STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional pathways determines the dendritic cell phenotype in the tumour microenvironment and STAT3 degraders hold promise for cancer immunotherapy.

 Photonic double-zero-index media, distinguished by concurrently zero-valued permittivity and permeability, exhibit extraordinary properties not found in nature1–8. Notably, the notion of zero index can be substantially expanded by generalizing the constitutive parameters from null scalars to non-reciprocal tensors with non-zero matrix elements but zero determinants9,10. Here we experimentally realize this class of gyromagnetic double-zero-index metamaterials possessing both double-zero-index features and non-reciprocal hallmarks. As an intrinsic property, this metamaterial always emerges at a spin-1/2 Dirac point of a topological phase transition. We discover and demonstrate that a spatiotemporal reflection vortex singularity is always anchored to the Dirac point of the metamaterial, with the vortex charge being determined by the topological invariant leap across the phase transition. This establishes a unique bulk–spatiotemporal vortex correspondence that extends the protected boundary effects into the time domain and characterizes topological phase-transition points, setting it apart from any pre-existing bulk–boundary correspondence. Based on this correspondence, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a mechanism to deterministically generate optical spatiotemporal vortex pulses11,12 with firmly fixed central frequency and momentum, hence showing ultrarobustness. Our findings uncover connections between zero-refractive-index photonics, topological photonics and singular optics, which might enable the manipulation of space-time topological light fields using the inherent topology of extreme-parameter metamaterials.

 Metastasis to the cerebrospinal-fluid-filled leptomeninges, or leptomeningeal metastasis, represents a fatal complication of solid tumours1. Multimodal analyses of clinical specimens reveal substantial inflammatory infiltrate in leptomeningeal metastases with enrichment of IFNγ and resulting downstream signalling. Here, to investigate and overcome this futile anti-tumour response within the leptomeninges, we developed syngeneic lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma leptomeningeal-metastasis mouse models. We show that transgenic host mice lacking IFNγ or its receptor fail to control the growth of leptomeningeal metastases growth. Leptomeningeal overexpression of Ifng through a targeted adeno-associated-virus-based system controls cancer cell growth independent of adaptive immunity. Using a suite of transgenic hosts, we demonstrate that leptomeningeal T cells generate IFNγ to actively recruit and activate peripheral myeloid cells, generating a diverse spectrum of dendritic cell subsets. Independent of antigen presentation, migratory CCR7+ dendritic cells orchestrate the influx, proliferation and cytotoxic action of natural killer cells to control cancer cell growth in the leptomeninges.

Frankland,Systems consolidation reorganizes hippocampal engram circuitry,"A study shows that loss of memory precision associated with systems consolidation can be explained by neurogenesis-dependent reorganization of engram circuitry within the hippocampus over time. 
 Episodic memories—high-fidelity memories for events that depend initially on the hippocampus—do not maintain their precision in perpetuity. One benefit of this time-dependent loss of precision is the emergence of event-linked gist memories that may be used to guide future behaviour in new but related situations (that is, generalization)1–3. Models of systems consolidation propose that memory reorganization accompanies this loss of memory precision1,4; however, the locus of this reorganization is unclear. Here we report that time-dependent reorganization of hippocampal engram circuitry is sufficient to explain shifts in memory precision associated with systems consolidation. Using engram labelling tools in mice, we demonstrate that the passage of time rewires hippocampal engram circuits, enabling hippocampal engram neurons to be promiscuously active and guide behaviour in related situations that do not match the original training conditions. Reorganization depends on hippocampal neurogenesis; eliminating hippocampal neurogenesis prevents reorganization and maintains precise, event memories. Conversely, promoting hippocampal neurogenesis accelerates memory reorganization and the emergence of event-linked gist memories in the hippocampus. Our results indicate that systems consolidation models require updating to account for within-hippocampus reorganization that leads to qualitative shifts in memory precision. A study shows that loss of memory precision associated with systems consolidation can be explained by neurogenesis-dependent reorganization of engram circuitry within the hippocampus over time."

 In quantum mechanics, empty space is not void but is characterized by vacuum-field fluctuations, which underlie phenomena such as the Lamb shift1, spontaneous emission, and the Casimir effect2. Due to their quantitatively small relative contributions in free-space atomic physics, they were traditionally overlooked in solid-state systems. Recently, however, the interplay between electronic correlations and quantum electrodynamical effects in low-dimensional systems has become a rapidly advancing area in condensed matter physics3–5, with substantial implications for quantum materials and device engineering. High-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in the quantum Hall regime6 offer an ideal platform to investigate how vacuum electromagnetic fields affect strongly correlated electronic states. Here we demonstrate that adjusting the coupling strength between a two-dimensional electron gas and the vacuum fields of a hovering split-ring resonator leads to a significant reduction in exchange splitting at odd-integer filling factors, along with an enhancement of fractional quantum Hall gaps at filling factors 4/3, 5/3 and 7/5. Theoretical analysis indicates that these effects stem from an effective long-range attractive interaction mediated by virtual cavity photons in regions with strong vacuum electric field gradients. Our findings uncover a new mechanism by which cavity vacuum fields can reshape electronic correlations in quantum Hall systems, establishing a new approach for manipulating correlated quantum phases in low-dimensional materials and paving the way for engineering tailored many-body interactions in compact devices.

 Hilbert space dimension is a key resource for quantum information processing1,2. Not only is a large overall Hilbert space an essential requirement for quantum error correction, but a large local Hilbert space can also be advantageous for realizing gates and algorithms more efficiently3–7. As a result, there has been considerable experimental effort in recent years to develop quantum computing platforms using qudits (d-dimensional quantum systems with d > 2) as the fundamental unit of quantum information8–19. Just as with qubits, quantum error correction of these qudits will be necessary in the long run, but so far, error correction of logical qudits has not been demonstrated experimentally.

 Chromosomal rearrangements and gene fusions are the initial events in the development of many cancers. Astroblastoma (ABM), a brain cancer of unknown cellular origin and challenging to treat, is associated with diverse in-frame gene fusions, including MN1-BEND2 and MN1-CXXC5 (refs. 1,2). However, it remains unclear whether these gene fusions contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we show in mice that these two ABM-associated fusions converge on similar molecular activities and initiate malignancy specifically in ventral telencephalon neural progenitors. BEND2 and CXXC5 recognize similar DNA motifs, which indicates a convergence on downstream gene regulation. Expression of MN1-BEND2 in ventral telencephalon neural progenitors results in aberrant cell proliferation, impaired differentiation, a perivascular occupancy pattern of cells reminiscent of ABM and acquisition of an ABM-associated transcriptional signature. By contrast, MN1-BEND2 expression in dorsal telencephalon neural progenitors leads to extensive cell death. This cell-type-specific malignancy depends on OLIG2 expression. Mechanistically, both ABM-associated fusion proteins (MN1–BEND2 and MN1–CXXC5) induce overlapping transcriptional responses, including the activation of a therapeutically targetable PDGFRα pathway. Collectively, our data suggest that distinct ABM-associated fusions upregulate shared transcriptional networks to disrupt the normal development of ventral telencephalon neural progenitors, which leads to oncogenic transformation. These findings uncover new avenues for targeted ABM treatment.

 The human cerebral cortex is composed of six layers and dozens of areas that are molecularly and structurally distinct1–4. Although single-cell transcriptomic studies have advanced the molecular characterization of human cortical development, a substantial gap exists owing to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation5–8. Here we used multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)9, augmented with deep-learning-based nucleus segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular and cytoarchitectural development of the human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing more than 18 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across seven developmental time points. We uncovered the early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable by the laminar distribution of excitatory neuron subtypes, 3 months before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, we discovered two distinct modes of cortical areal specification during mid-gestation: (1) a continuous, gradual transition observed across most cortical areas along the anterior–posterior axis and (2) a discrete, abrupt boundary specifically identified between the primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortices as early as gestational week 20. This sharp binary transition in V1–V2 neuronal subtypes challenges the notion that mid-gestation cortical arealization involves only gradient-like transitions6,10. Furthermore, integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing with MERFISH revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific layer 4 neurons. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This study establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm and paves the way for the construction of a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain.

 Ultra-long-range genomic contacts, which are key components of neuronal genome architecture1–3, constitute a biochemical enigma. This is because regulatory DNA elements make selective and stable contacts with DNA sequences located hundreds of kilobases away, instead of interacting with proximal sequences occupied by the exact same transcription factors1,4. This is exemplified in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), in which only a fraction of LHX2-, EBF1- and LDB1-bound sites interact with each other, converging into highly selective multi-chromosomal enhancer hubs5. To obtain biochemical insight into this process, here we assembled olfactory receptor (OR) enhancer hubs in vitro with recombinant proteins and enhancer DNA. Cell-free reconstitution of enhancer hubs revealed that OR enhancers form nucleoprotein condensates with unusual, solid-like characteristics. Assembly of these solid condensates is orchestrated by specific DNA motifs enriched in OR enhancers, which are likely to confer distinct homotypic properties on their resident LHX2–EBF1–LDB1 complexes. Single-molecule tracking and pulse-chase experiments in vivo confirmed that LHX2 and EBF1 assemble OR-transcription-competent condensates with solid properties in OSN nuclei, under physiological concentrations of protein. Thus, homophilic nucleoprotein interactions that are influenced by DNA sequence generate new types of biomolecular condensate, which might provide a generalizable explanation for the stability and specificity of long-range genomic contacts across cell types.

 Imposing incommensurable periodicity on the periodic atomic lattice can lead to complex structural phases consisting of locally periodic structure bounded by topological defects1–8. Twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) is an ideal material platform to study the interplay between different atomic periodicities, which can be tuned by twist angles between the layers, leading to moiré-of-moiré lattices9–26. Interlayer and intralayer interactions between two interfaces in TTG transform this moiré-of-moiré lattice into an intricate network of domain structures at small twist angles, which can harbour exotic electronic behaviours9–26. Here we report a complete structural phase diagram of TTG with atomic-scale lattice reconstruction. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with a new interatomic potential simulation27,28, we show several large-scale moiré lattices, including triangular, kagome and a corner-shared hexagram-shaped domain pattern. Each domain is bounded by a 2D network of domain-wall lattices. In the limit of small twist angles, two competing structural orders—rhombohedral and Bernal stackings—with a slight energy difference cause unconventional lattice reconstruction with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and nematic instability, highlighting the importance of long-range interlayer interactions across entire van der Waals layers. The diverse tessellation of distinct domains, whose topological network can be tuned by the adjustment of the twist angles, establishes TTG as a platform for exploring the interplay between emerging quantum properties and controllable nontrivial lattices. Examination of a complete structural phase diagram of twisted trilayer graphene shows that several large-scale moiré domain lattices can be formed, the physical properties of which can be tuned by the twist angles between layers."

 When two massive objects (black holes, neutron stars or stars) in our universe fly past each other, their gravitational interactions deflect their trajectories1,2. The gravitational waves emitted in the related bound-orbit system—the binary inspiral—are now routinely detected by gravitational-wave observatories3. Theoretical physics needs to provide high-precision templates to make use of unprecedented sensitivity and precision of the data from upcoming gravitational-wave observatories4. Motivated by this challenge, several analytical and numerical techniques have been developed to approximately solve this gravitational two-body problem. Although numerical relativity is accurate5–7, it is too time-consuming to rapidly produce large numbers of gravitational-wave templates. For this, approximate analytical results are also required8–15. Here we report on a new, highest-precision analytical result for the scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a black hole or neutron star scattering encounter at the fifth order in Newton’s gravitational coupling G, assuming a hierarchy in the two masses. This is achieved by modifying state-of-the-art techniques for the scattering of elementary particles in colliders to this classical physics problem in our universe. Our results show that mathematical functions related to Calabi–Yau (CY) manifolds, 2n-dimensional generalizations of tori, appear in the solution to the radiated energy in these scatterings. We anticipate that our analytical results will allow the development of a new generation of gravitational-wave models, for which the transition to the bound-state problem through analytic continuation and strong-field resummation will need to be performed.

 Choice behaviour of animals is characterized by two main tendencies: taking actions that led to rewards and repeating past actions1,2. Theory suggests that these strategies may be reinforced by different types of dopaminergic teaching signals: reward prediction error to reinforce value-based associations and movement-based action prediction errors to reinforce value-free repetitive associations3–6. Here we use an auditory discrimination task in mice to show that movement-related dopamine activity in the tail of the striatum encodes the hypothesized action prediction error signal. Causal manipulations reveal that this prediction error serves as a value-free teaching signal that supports learning by reinforcing repeated associations. Computational modelling and experiments demonstrate that action prediction errors alone cannot support reward-guided learning, but when paired with the reward prediction error circuitry they serve to consolidate stable sound–action associations in a value-free manner. Together we show that there are two types of dopaminergic prediction errors that work in tandem to support learning, each reinforcing different types of association in different striatal areas. Dopaminergic action prediction error signals are used by mice as a value-free teaching signal to reinforce stable sound–action associations in the tail of the striatum."

 Debris disks are exoplanetary systems that contain planets, minor bodies (asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets and so on) and micrometre-sized debris dust1. Because water ice is the most common frozen volatile, it plays an essential role in the formation of planets2,3 and minor bodies. Although water ice has been commonly found in Kuiper belt objects and comets in the Solar System4, no definitive evidence for water ice in debris disks has been obtained to date1. Here we report the discovery of water ice in the HD 181327 debris disk using the near-infrared spectrograph onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We detected the solid-state broad absorption feature of water ice at 3 µm including a distinct Fresnel peak at 3.1 µm, which is indicative of large, crystalline water-ice particles. Gradients in the water-ice feature as a function of stellocentric distance reveal a dynamic environment in which water ice is destroyed and replenished. We estimated the water-ice mass fractions as ranging from 0.1% at approximately 85 au to 21% at approximately 113 au, indicating the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 disk beyond the snow line. The icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 are probably the extra-solar counterparts of water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System.

Johansen,Prefrontal encoding of an internal model for emotional inference,"Neurons in the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encode a flexible internal model of emotion by linking directly experienced and inferred associations with aversive experiences. 
 A key function of brain systems mediating emotion is to learn to anticipate unpleasant experiences. Although organisms readily associate sensory stimuli with aversive outcomes, higher-order forms of emotional learning and memory require inference to extrapolate the circumstances surrounding directly experienced aversive events to other indirectly related sensory patterns that were not part of the original experience. This type of learning requires internal models of emotion, which flexibly track directly experienced and inferred aversive associations. Although the brain mechanisms of simple forms of aversive learning have been well studied in areas such as the amygdala1–4, whether and how the brain forms and represents internal models of emotionally relevant associations are not known5. Here we report that neurons in the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) encode a flexible internal model of emotion by linking sensory stimuli in the environment with aversive events, whether they were directly or indirectly associated with that experience. These representations form through a multi-step encoding mechanism involving recruitment and stabilization of dmPFC cells that support inference. Although dmPFC population activity encodes all salient associations, dmPFC neurons projecting to the amygdala specifically represent and are required to express inferred associations. Together, these findings reveal how internal models of emotion are encoded in the dmPFC to regulate subcortical systems for recall of inferred emotional memories.

 The Moon undergoes periodic tidal forcing due to its eccentric and oblique orbit around the Earth1. The response to this tidal interaction drives temporal changes in the lunar gravity field and is sensitive to the satellite’s internal structure2–4. We use data from the NASA GRAIL spacecraft5–9 to recover the time-varying lunar gravity field, including a degree-3 gravitational tidal Love number, k3. Here, we report our estimated value of k3 = 0.0163 ± 0.0007, which is about 72% higher than that expected for a spherically symmetric moon10. Such a large k3 can be explained if the elastic shear modulus of the mantle varies by about 2–3% between the nearside and farside4, providing an observational demonstration of lateral heterogeneities in the deep lunar interior. This asymmetric structure suggests preservation of a predominantly thermal anomaly of roughly 100–200 K in the nearside mantle that formed surface mare regions 3–4 billion years ago11 and could influence the spatial distribution of deep moonquakes12.

Here, the authors investigate the efficacy of adjunctive antibiotic and phage therapy in a human cell model and a murine model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. 
 Bacterial multidrug resistance poses an urgent challenge for the treatment of critically ill patients developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Phage therapy, a potential alternative when conventional antibiotics fail, has been unsuccessful in first clinical trials when used alone. Whether combining antibiotics with phages may enhance effectiveness remains to be tested in experimental models. Here, we use a murine model of Pseudomonas-induced VAP to compare the efficacy of adjunctive phage cocktail for antibiotic therapy to either meropenem or phages alone. Combined treatment in murine VAP results in faster clinical improvement and prevents lung epithelial cell damage. Using human primary epithelial cells to dissect these synergistic effects, we find that adjunctive phage therapy reduces the minimum effective concentration of meropenem and prevents resistance development against both treatments. These findings suggest adjunctive phage therapy represents a promising treatment for MDR-induced VAP, enhancing the effectiveness of both antibiotics and phages while reducing adverse effects. Multidrug-resistant pathogens have become increasingly common in hospital settings.

 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe neuromuscular disorder caused by DMD gene mutations, leading to the loss of functional dystrophin. While antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping offers therapeutic potential, its efficacy in cardiac muscle remains limited. Here, we investigate DG9, a cell-penetrating peptide derived from human polyhomeotic 1 homolog (Hph-1) transcription factor, as an enhancer of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO)-based therapy targeting exon 44. In a humanized DMD mouse model (hDMDdel45;mdx), DG9-PMO significantly increases exon skipping, restores dystrophin expression, and improves muscle function, particularly in the heart. Mechanistically, DG9-PMO enhances intracellular uptake through multiple endocytic pathways and achieves superior nuclear localization.

 Ferroelectric materials are promising for developing non-volatile memory, neuromorphic computing, and photovoltaic technologies. Taking advantage of variable switching kinetics provides an important strategy for designing multifunctional ferroelectric devices. However, the conventional ferroelectrics due to the unmovable atomic species generally own a single switching kinetics, thus versatile and configurable switching kinetics still remain challenging. In this work, we systematically investigate the switching kinetics of the van der Waals ferroionic CuInP2S6 through polarization-determined ferroelectric photovoltaic behaviors. Based on the time- and field-dependent polarization switching and numerical simulation, we discover three switching modes, including intralayer switching, interlayer switching and intralayer-interlayer coupling switching in CuInP2S6. Through designing the poling voltage amplitude and width, we achieve the configurable kinetic control of polarization switching in CuInP2S6, enabling tunable binary, gradual and accumulative switching with defined poling voltages in a single device.

 Evolution of warming tolerance may help species resist the impacts of climate change but can also lead to negative fitness outcomes. Identifying correlated responses to warming tolerance evolution could identify such negative consequences and help uncover the underlying mechanisms. By assessing the correlated responses of life history and physiological traits to seven generations of artificial selection to increase or decrease the acute upper thermal tolerance limit (CTmax) in zebrafish (Danio rerio), we show that warming-adapted lines have improved cooling tolerance. Furthermore, the absence of difference between selected lines in aerobic metabolic scope, brain heat shock protein levels, fecundity, growth or swimming speed contradicts several hypotheses concerning the mechanisms controlling acute warming tolerance. These results suggest that selection due to acute heating events does not target variation in metabolic rates but can benefit tolerance to cold, making individuals more resilient to extreme temperature events.

 Industrial wastewater typically contains high concentrations of contaminants and should be treated before being released into the environment, discharged to a sewer, or recycled for reuse. Large amounts of greenhouse gases are produced during the treatment processes of industrial wastewater, yet are scarcely considered in the emission estimation of the wastewater sector. Here, we present a comprehensive methane (CH4) emission inventory for industrial wastewater treatment in China from 2000 to 2021, employing industry-specific emission factors (EF), contrasting with previous estimations that rely on a uniform EF without differentiating between industries. We demonstrate here that total CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment in China were 2.4 Tg in 2000 and 1.4 Tg in 2021, showing an increasing trend during 2000–2012 and a substantial decline afterward, which is attributed to government-led control measures aimed at promoting cleaner production practices and optimizing industrial structures. Eastern coastal provinces exhibit higher emissions than inland regions, with Shandong, Zhejiang, Henan, and Jiangsu collectively contributing more than 50% of total emissions. We identify the Textile and Light Industry as the pivotal sector for mitigating CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment. This sector is responsible for 82.9% of total CH4 emissions, despite contributing less than 19.0% to the national total value-added industrial output. By 2035, around 48% of CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment could be reduced, primarily driven by stringent mitigation measures in the Textile and Light Industry.

 Depleted components in hotspot magma sources remain enigmatic. Zircon δ18O values (3.97–4.80‰, average 4.38‰) from depleted gabbros in the Comei province (Kerguelen plume) are lower than mantle zircons, correlating negatively with 206Pb/U238ages. Combined with ultradepleted Hf isotopes, this excludes hydrothermal alteration or crustal contamination, instead indicating mixing of heterogeneous mantle magmas with light-oxygen, Hf-depleted components. Elevated Sc/Nb and Y/Nb ratios preclude upper mantle entrainment, while light δ¹⁸O contradicts ancient melting residues. We propose these components originate from recycled high-temperature hydrothermally altered gabbroic oceanic crust, which underwent melt extraction during subduction before incorporation into the plume. Gradual δ¹⁸O increases reflect progressive consumption of these components during melting with ambient mantle. This study highlights recycled gabbroic crust’s role in generating depleted hotspot magmas. Preservation and emergence of low δ¹⁸O and depleted geochemical signatures requires limited mixing with enriched/high-δ¹⁸O materials, as these fragile signatures are easily masked by geochemical overprinting.

 Despite their relative rarity, atmospheric rivers are key contributors to the surface mass balance of Antarctica. However, the future role of atmospheric rivers in modulating Antarctic sea-level contributions is a major area of uncertainty. Here, we leverage high-resolution climate simulations to show that Antarctic atmospheric rivers are highly sensitive to future increases in atmospheric moisture, leading to a doubling of atmospheric river frequencies and 2.5 × increase in precipitation from 2066–2100 under present-day thresholds for atmospheric river detection. However, future precipitation impacts are critically dependent on the detection threshold: accounting for moisture increases in the threshold produces smaller, regional changes in atmospheric river frequency, primarily resulting from an eastward shift in the polar jet maximum wind speeds. Our results underscore the importance of using large ensembles to quantify Antarctic atmospheric river responses to variability in projected moisture, which may not be captured when using only a few ensemble members.

 Near-surface air temperature (Ta) is a critical meteorological variable, and obtaining its precise spatiotemporal distribution is essential for numerous scientific domains beyond meteorology and hydrology. Despite the promising advancements in Ta mapping using machine learning, these models often suffer from inadequate generalization capabilities due to their heavy reliance on data. A critical limitation is that their “free” learning style fails to deeply uncover the intricate spatiotemporal patterns of Ta. Addressing this problem, we propose a novel knowledge-augmented deep fusion method (KADF), designed to enhance the accuracy of Ta mapping through integrating prior knowledge. KADF integrates three categories of prior knowledge concerning Ta: spatial autocorrelation, temporal autocorrelation, and temporal heterogeneity in the relationship between Ta and predictive variables. This tailored strategy enables the model to more efficiently explore the intricate spatiotemporal relationships between grounded Ta observations and satellite-derived auxiliary variables, culminating in accurate Ta estimates through the deep fusion of these datasets. The efficacy of KADF was thoroughly evaluated over Chinese mainland. The validation results show that KADF accurately mapped the spatiotemporal distribution of daily Ta, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 1.0 °C for mean Ta (Tmean), 1.22 °C for maximum Ta (Tmax), and 1.33 °C for minimum Ta (Tmin). Moreover, the integration of prior knowledge regarding Ta significantly enhanced the generalizability of the data-driven mapping model. Compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning-based estimation method, KADF reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) values by 23–31 % and RMSEs by 24–29 %. Furthermore, this method considerably improved the ability to capture spatial and temporal variations in Ta across various environmental conditions. Finally, a 1 km daily Ta dataset for the time frame spanning from 2010 to 2018 was produced. Overall, KADF holds great promise for accurately estimating Ta and can be easily adapted to other regions. The source code of KADF has been made publicly available at https://github.com/Henu-frch/KADF."

 One of the core applications of satellite-based classification maps is area estimation. Regardless of the algorithms used, maps will always contain errors stemming from imperfect input and training/calibration data, incomplete data coverage, and spectral and/or temporal confusion between land cover and land use classes. Because of omission and commission errors, the pixel-counting area estimator will be a biased estimator for area estimation. Therefore, the remote sensing research and application communities have developed a framework and recommended practices to address this problem. One such approach is a stratified random sampling design, in which classification maps could be used for stratification in the sampling design, and areas are estimated from the sample data, which represent reference data or reference class labels. As such, the quality of the map, i.e., producer's (PA) and user's accuracy (UA), will not affect the bias of the estimator, as the bias depends on the sampling design and the choice of estimator. However, map quality will impact the efficiency of stratification: a more accurate map will require a smaller sample size to reach the target variance of the estimate, or it will yield improved precision if the sample size is fixed. This study aims to provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of map accuracies on area estimation within the stratified random sampling design. The relative bias of the pixel-counting estimator is expressed using class-specific PA and UA, and shown to be PAUA−1. Furthermore, for the case of binary classification, elements of the confusion matrix, as well as the sample size, variance of the area estimator, and relative efficiency of stratification (the ratio of the products of variance and sample size for the two sampling approaches) are expressed using PA and UA. Numerical simulations demonstrate how relative efficiency depends on area estimation objectives, target area proportion, and the map's performance metrics (PA and UA). Such dependence is nonlinear, and the impact of those parameters varies. For example, when the target class is minor or rare (i.e., its true proportion is <<0.5), the impact of PA outweighs that of UA. As the target area proportion increases, the impact of accuracies converges, and UA has a greater impact on efficiency than PA. There are multiple values in the PA/UA space, though constrained, to reach the same objectives, e.g., in terms of relative efficiency, sample size, and target variance. Overall, this study offers map producers a criterion that can be used to benchmark algorithm performance for map generation when area estimation is the primary objective of the classification maps."

 Ocean primary production is a key process that regulates marine ecosystems and the global climate, but its estimation is still affected by multiple uncertainties. Typically, the chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) is used to characterise this process, as it is considered as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass. To date, the most common observing systems for studying CHL are ocean colour satellites and Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats. These are complementary systems: satellite observations provide global coverage but are limited to the ocean surface, while BGC-Argo floats provide punctual observations along the whole water column. Quantitative matching of these two observing systems has been obtained only at regional or single-float scales, while at a global scale the relatively low and irregular BGC-Argo coverage results in large uncertainties. Here, we propose a different method, by comparing satellite and BGC-Argo climatological annual time series within seven different bioregions, each characterised by a homogeneous phytoplankton phenology, allowing us to smooth the uncertainties. By comparing the mean values, amplitudes, and shapes of the two time series, we identify regions (a) where they agree (58%–61% of the ocean surface area); (b) regions undersampled by the BGC-Argo float network (particularly in the Arabian Sea and near the Amazon delta); (c) where the discrepancy may stem from satellite or (d) BGC-Argo performance (mainly found at subtropical and high latitudes, respectively). Caution is required when using BGC-Argo and satellite data in regions b–d, and, for each region, we provide suggestions on which system could be affected by the largest uncertainties."

 Amid climate change and urban expansion, urban floods (UFs) have become a significant concern. Effective UF management requires two key elements: (1) assessing susceptibility to identify flood-prone hotspots and (2) analyzing factor contributions to pinpoint primary drivers. While research on urban flood susceptibility (UFS) is well-established, studies on factor contributions usually limited to the simple application without fully evaluating their alignment with UF characteristics. This study addresses this gap by examining Shenzhen, a rapidly urbanizing city, and applying various regression methods (linear, multiple machine learning (ML), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)) to evaluate flood-driving factors. Through accuracy assessments and environmental considerations, we identify the most suitable methods for this analysis. Our findings include: (1) Random Forest (RF)-based UFS assessment reveals significant spatial heterogeneity, with higher UFS in central-western areas and lower risks in the southeast; (2) the most contributing factors in Shenzhen exhibit non-linear and non-parametric effects on UF, supporting the use of RF; (3) we found substantial spatial heterogeneity in factor contributions, necessitating SHAP analysis to capture local variations and provide tailored management insights. Thus, this study integrates methodological rigor with urban environmental context, enhancing factor contribution analysis for UF and supporting effective management strategies."

 Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a key property for soil health. Spectral reflectance such as multispectral and hyperspectral data could provide efficient and cost-effective retrieval of SOC content. However, constrained by the availability of hyperspectral satellite data, current works mostly use a small number of spaceborne hyperspectral imagery for SOC retrieval on a small scale. In this work, the first large-scale hyperspectral imaging reflectance composites were built, and they were used for SOC estimation. Specifically, DESIS satellite images were used to predict SOC over the whole state of Bavaria in Germany (∼ 70,000 km2). We prepare 850 hyperspectral images from the DESIS satellite and build temporal composites from them. For the soil data, data was gathered from LfU(Bavarian State Office for the Environment), LfL(Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture) and LUCAS 2018 (Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey). 828 soil samples were selected after data filtering. For this regression task, different machine learning and deep learning methods were implemented and explored. Moreover, a spectral attention mechanism was added to the model. Besides hyperspectral input, the digital elevation model (DEM) was also included as an auxiliary input as the measured spectrum has inter-variability dependent on the elevation and the generated topographical features are also relevant with SOC distribution. Based on the regression results evaluated by RMSE, R2, and RPIQ, the deep learning models showed much better performance than machine learning methods. Especially when only using hyperspectral data as input, the best result was achieved with RMSE 1.947%, R2 0.626, and RPIQ 1.710 on the test set. After incorporating topographical features, the fused model achieved further improved performance with RMSE 1.752% and R2 0.695 and RPIQ 1.919. From the interpretability analysis for model performance, it was found out that the bands in the range of 530 nm–570 nm, 770 nm–790 nm, and 840 nm - 870 nm are the most relevant bands for SOC estimation. In the end, several SOC maps were generated and analyzed together with soil types. The SOC maps indicate that water-associated areas, such as coastal soils and bogs, tend to have higher SOC, while mountain areas tend to contain lower SOC. Such findings align with SOC distribution across soil types and show the effectiveness of the model."

 Population analysis units (PAUs), as fundamental spatial units accommodating population-related activities, hold significance in constructing spatiotemporal interaction networks to understand intra-unit population distribution and activity patterns as well as inter-unit interactions. However, existing networks are constrained by fixed scales and the absence of temporal dynamics, with insufficient consideration of multi-scale features, thereby limiting their semantic representation and dynamic analysis capabilities. Thus, we proposed a heterogeneous multi-scale PAU interaction network (HMS-PAU-IN) model that integrates spatial, temporal, and semantic representations, enabling HMS-PAU-IN modeling and semantic analysis based on spatiotemporal knowledge graph. In the spatial dimension, spatiotemporal interactions are classified into explicit interactions driven by population flows and potential interactions shaped by spatial relationships. In the temporal dimension, the changes of PAUs are captured through the evolutionary relationships of nodes between different time windows. To validate the model, we developed a population prediction model that integrates the multi-scale features of PAUs and introduced Leiden-IES-PMS, a community detection method based on the Leiden algorithm, which integrates internal and external environmental semantics and adopts a proximity merging strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model and method effectively characterize spatiotemporal interactions among multi-scale PAUs, enhancing the accuracy of population distribution prediction (R2 = 0.77) at the community scale, and improving the interpretability of temporal community analysis at the building scale. This study develops a multi-scale spatiotemporal framework for analyzing population distribution, activity patterns, and community evolution within PAUs, providing actionable insights for urban planning, resource optimization, and sustainable management."

 Satellite platforms have become the principal data source for large-scale rice mapping. Numerous studies investigated the advantages of integrating deep learning models with satellite data for rice mapping, but these studies are typically confined to specific regions and the quality of customized datasets varies. The absence of a global, standardized satellite dataset for rice mapping benchmarking has long resulted in both substantial redundant data processing efforts and challenges in evaluating new algorithms under a unified benchmark. To address these deficiencies, this paper introduces Plot-Rice v1.0, a global heterogeneous rice benchmark dataset based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, along with an automated framework that integrates SAR temporal features and leverages the foundation image segmentation model SAM-2 to generate plot-level rice samples. This framework effectively addresses the limitation of SAM-2, which supports zero-shot segmentation but lacks classification capabilities. Plot-Rice comprehensively accounts for the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of rice, incorporating plot-level rice labels and corresponding multi-source feature time series from 20 countries globally. In terms of feature composition, Plot-Rice integrates multi-source features, including radar backscattering coefficients, normalized backscattering coefficients, radar vegetation indices, spectral indices, and spectral combinations, constructing time series for 12 months of 2023 to facilitate temporal analysis. Finally, using this dataset, a series of benchmark experiments is conducted, encompassing performance comparisons of models such as U-Net, Res U-Net, Deeplabv3+, and HR-Net under multi-source feature time series, and comparisons of rice distribution extraction performance across diverse countries. Several recommendations are summarized for artificial intelligence (AI) in rice mapping to serve as a reference, contributing to global food security solutions."

 Irrigated dryland in China, largely distributed and expanding in arid and semi-arid regions, always poses challenges to water resource and ecosystems, thus deeply impacts the implementation of SDG 2, 6, 15 and so on. Spatial-temporal patterns of irrigated dryland with high resolution help pinpoint hotspots and key issues worth to concern, however, are still lacking in research. This study developed a zonal-specific methodology to identify irrigated dryland and its changes from 2000 to 2015 at national scale with 30 m resolution. The whole China was divided into five zones based on cropping patterns. Key phases of remote sensing data and environmental factors were combined to generate zonal-specific methodologies for the identification of irrigated dryland. Meanwhile changes of features were employed to identify changes of irrigated dryland. Results show that the ratio of vegetation indices to environmental factors exhibits stronger stability in the classification of each zone. That being said, these of slope and texture varied from zone to zone. Moreover, using difference data between two periods for change information extraction demonstrated high accuracy. This method not only avoids the error accumulation caused by overlaying the direct classification results of two periods but also addresses the issue of insufficient classification accuracy due to the shortage of samples and data in historical periods. The average overall accuracy (the kappa coefficient) on generated maps of irrigated dryland in 2000 and 2015 are 88.28% (0.758) and 87.65% (0.744). The irrigated dryland had been increased by 8.84% from 2000 to 2015 and their distribution became denser and shifted towards north of China. With the advancement of economy and technology, the influence of human factors on the distribution of irrigated drylands has gradually intensified. The stable development of irrigated drylands ensures China’s food security and contributes to global food security. Meanwhile, it poses significant challenges to water resources and the ecological environment. This research developed methodologies to obtain accurate irrigated dryland data and its change information, supporting to identify the interaction between SDG 2, SDG 6, and SDG 15, especially in arid and semi-arid regions with vulnerable ecosystem in the world."

The two exterior barriers, featuring a rigid cell wall and a dense plasma membrane, are unique with complementary structural, mechanical, and chemical properties. Current strategies for producing therapeutic drugs within plant cells for oral delivery are efficient, but largely limited to recombinant pharmaceutical proteins, and involve complex genetic modification of plants. To address this, we engineer plant cell–inspired delivery systems with cellulose nanofiber–based shells and lipid layers through a bottom-up assembly strategy, which offers greater flexibility to encapsulate nonprotein compounds and nanoparticles. Notably, the layered shell structure resists degradation in acidic environments, and two barriers respond differently to external stimuli in simulated gastrointestinal medium, resulting in size-dependent dual-triggered release mechanisms. The cytocompatibility was shown by incubation with Caco-2 cells. Our results open avenues for developing next generation of bioinspired oral delivery systems for multisite-specific gastrointestinal release in a low-cost and sustainable manner."

However, they often exhibit poor ion transport across grain boundaries and pores. This work demonstrates that strategically tuning the mesoscale microstructures, including pore size, pore distribution, and chemical compositions of grain boundaries, can improve ion transport. Using LiTa2PO8as a case study, we have shown that the combination of LiF as a sintering agent with Hf4+implantation improves grain-grain contact, resulting in smaller, evenly distributed pores, reduced chemical contrast, and minimized nonconductive impurities. A suite of techniques has been used to decouple the effects of LiF and Hf4+. Specifically, LiF modifies particle shape and breaks large pores into smaller ones, while Hf4+addresses the chemical mismatches between grains and grain boundaries. Consequently, this approach achieves nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in ion conduction. Tuning mesoscale structures offers a cost-effective method for enhancing ion transport in polycrystalline systems and has notable implications for synthesizing high-performance ionic materials."

In four experiments, we used cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to enhance (ccPASPMv-M1) or inhibit (ccPASM1-PMv) PMv-to-M1 connectivity via Hebbian plasticity. Leveraging state-dependent properties of transcranial magnetic stimulation, we targeted function-specific visuomotor neurons within the pathway, testing their physiological/behavioral relevance to AVMM. State-dependent ccPASPMv-M1, applied during motor responses to target visual cues, enhanced neurophysiological and behavioral indices of AVMM, while ccPASM1-PMvhad an opposite influence, with the effects being more pronounced for target relative to control visual cues.

Here, we measure the size of segments that activate synchronously during tremor episodes and the relationship to regional earthquake rate on major plate boundaries. Tremor synchronization in space seems to be limited by the activity of small, nearby crustal and intraslab earthquakes.

In terrestrial vertebrates, inhaled odorants diffuse through olfactory epithelial mucus (OEM) before activating olfactory receptors (ORs) on olfactory sensory neurons and initiating adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)–mediated signaling. Impaired OEM secretion is associated with impaired olfactory sensitivity in humans and mice, but it remains unclear whether OEM directly improves sensitivity and whether specific active factors exist. Here, using a cAMP imaging–based heterologous OR expression assay, we demonstrate that fibronectin from human OEM increases the sensitivity of OR response to odorant. Fibronectin application partially restores electrical olfactory response of the mouse olfactory epithelium after OEM removal. In humans, OEM fibronectin levels are significantly decreased in patients with idiopathic olfactory disorder. These findings shed light on the role of OEM fibronectin in olfaction and may lead to sensitivity-enhancing additives for odorant sensors and treatments for hyposmia."

To quantitatively test this, we applied high-precision fluid inclusion barometry via Raman spectroscopy to samples from representative volcanoes of different evolutionary stages. This suggests an evolution from shield-stage shallow magma storage (~1 to 2 kilometers) for Kīlauea to a post-shield stage that includes crustal magma storage within the volcanic edifice (~2 kilometers) and deeper storage below the Moho (~20 to 27 kilometers) for Haleakalā.

A simplified theoretical model demonstrates that this behavior results from the interplay between pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations, with predictions validated through simulations and experiments using hard magnetic elastomers. Resisting forces generated by multiple M-interfaces counteract asymmetric snapping, enabling distinct symmetric configurations. Extending this approach to higher-order symmetric snapping, we uncover a quasi-linear scaling law between critical fields and snapping order.

We thus applied state-of-the-art, large-scale metabolomics in patients with idiopathic and monogenic PD and controls from two independent samples, analyzed by a strict meta-analysis approach. Thereby, we (i) debunked thatl-Dopa medication and not disease status causes the most substantial metabolomic differences and (ii) identified polyamine metabolism alterations, partly, but not entirely associated withl-Dopa treatment. Furthermore, we found explorative but robust evidence for alterations in endocannabinoid metabolites; detected lipid metabolism alterations, highlighting potential crosslinks with alpha-synuclein pathology; and provided evidence for a metabolomic signature for the role of oxidative damage in patients withPRKN- andPINK1-linked PD."

However, conventional strain is below 0.5%, limiting exploration of unique properties under substantial strain. In addition, while uniaxial strain modifies magnetic interactions anisotropically, its influence on skyrmions is underexplored. Here, we integrate skyrmion-hosting multilayers with a flexible liquid crystal film, enabling multistep skyrmion phase transitions through light-induced uniaxial strain up to 1%. Our results demonstrate that skyrmion transitions are sensitive to strain magnitude and orientation. Strain below 0.6% parallel to stripes transforms them into skyrmions. Above 0.6%, skyrmions elongate perpendicularly to the strain direction, exhibiting a negative Poisson effect, with deformation up to 40% at 0.8% strain. Further strain reverts skyrmions back into stripes. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that these phenomena stem from strain-induced anisotropic modulation of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This approach, which combines flexibility, light activation, and substantial uniaxial strain, offers a promising strategy for low-power, multistate spintronic devices."

Intratumoral type I interferon (IFN-I) has long been associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, several IFN-I subtypes can also paradoxically promote tumor growth in some contexts. We investigated this further by engineering murine B16 melanoma cells to overexpress various IFN-I subtypes, where a spectrum of outcomes was observed. Characterization of these tumors by RNA sequencing revealed a tumor immune phenotype, where potent IFN-I signaling concomitant with diminished type 2 inflammation failed to confer durable tumor control. T cell–mediated rejection of these tumors was restored by introducing interleukin-4 (IL-4) into the tumor microenvironment, either through ectopic expression or in a preclinical adoptive T cell therapy model. Collectively, our findings highlight the IFN-I/IL-4 axis in promoting antitumor immunity, which could be harnessed to target and stratify solid tumors that are nonresponsive to frontline therapies."

In this work, we use multiplexed ancestral sequence reconstruction (mASR) to address this, exploring the evolutionary sequence space of PET-degrading cutinases. Using 20 statistically equivalent phylogenies of the bacterial cutinase family, we generated 48 ancestral sequences revealing a wide range of PETase activities, highlighting the value of mASR in uncovering functional variants. Our findings show PETase activity can evolve through multiple pathways involving mutations remote from the active site. Moreover, analyzing the PETase fitness landscape with local ancestral sequence embedding (LASE) revealed that LASE can capture sequence features linked to PETase activity. This work highlights mASR’s potential in exploration of sequence space and underscores the use of LASE in readily mapping the protein fitness landscapes."

Their formation is often linked to plume-lithosphere interactions, with some coronae showing signs of plate boundary-like processes such as subduction. However, the low resolution of Venus gravity data limits detailed analysis of these features. Using 3D geodynamic models, we predict gravity signals under various plume-induced corona formation scenarios. Comparing these predictions to observations, we show that combining topography and gravity data is more effective for understanding dynamic processes than using topography alone. Of the 75 resolved coronae, gravity indicates buoyant mantle material beneath 52. We predict a range of plume-lithosphere interactions and activity stages across these coronae. Moreover, we find that the limited resolution of the Magellan gravity field can obscure gravity signatures otherwise indicative of plume activity. The upcoming VERITAS mission will greatly improve gravity resolution, which will resolve 427 coronae, enhancing our understanding of Venus’ lithospheric structure and geodynamics."

What drives Par-3 to the cytoplasm and its impact on RGP ACD remain unknown. Here, we visualize cytoplasmic Par-3 using in vivo time-lapse imaging and find that Ser954of zebrafish Par-3 is phosphorylated by Aurora kinase A (AurkA) in vitro. Expression of the nonphosphorylated mutant Par-3S954Adominant negatively affects embryonic development, reduces cytoplasmic Par-3, and disrupts the anteroposterior asymmetry of cortical Par-3 and Dld endosomes and, in turn, daughter cell fate. AurkA in mitotic RGPs shows dynamic pericentrosomal distribution that transiently colocalizes with cortical Par-3 preferentially on the posterior side. AurkA is both necessary and sufficient to increase cytoplasmic while decreasing cortical Par-3, disrupts Par-3 cortical asymmetry, and perturbs polarized Dld endosome dynamics. These findings suggest that AurkA regulates Par-3 cortical-cytoplasmic dynamics that is critical for ACD and daughter cell fate."
