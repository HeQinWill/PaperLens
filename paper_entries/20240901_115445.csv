10.1088/1748-9326/ad6fba,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了实验性升温对北方和温带森林土壤碳动态的影响，通过对97项研究的荟萃分析，发现升温导致地上生物量和凋落物增加，但土壤有机碳含量没有明显变化。论文重点关注土壤碳循环对气候变化的响应，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['soil carbon', 'forest', 'warming', 'climate change']",Shan Xu;Jie Ou;Xinxin Qiao;Zhenzhong Zeng;Junjian Wang,Experimental warming affects soil carbon dynamics in boreal and temperate forests: a meta-analysis,"Boreal and temperate forests, spanning cold mid- to high-latitude environments and encompassing about 43% of the global forest area, are highly vulnerable to warming. Understanding the response of soil carbon (C) dynamics in these forests to warming is of paramount importance, yet significant uncertainty remains. In this meta-analysis, data from 97 studies across 65 sites were synthesized to investigate the effects of warming on soil C inputs, pools, and outputs in boreal and temperate forests. Our results reveal that warming increased aboveground biomass (by 33%) and litterfall (by 15%), while decreasing litter mass remaining (by 7%), with no significant change observed in fine root biomass. Furthermore, warming led to a 9% increase in soil total respiration and a 15% increase in autotrophic respiration, yet had no discernible impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) content. The methods, magnitude, and duration of warming were found to regulate the responses of soil C dynamics. Buried heater warming elicited the most pronounced effects among warming methods. Additionally, soil total respiration exhibited an acclimation response to warming magnitude and duration, while litter decomposition rates increased and SOC content and microbial biomass C decreased with escalating warming magnitude. Moreover, greater soil respiration response occurred in temperate forests than in boreal forests. These findings underscore the nuanced and context-dependent nature of soil C dynamics in response to experimental warming, providing critical insights for understanding the role of boreal and temperate forests in future climate change mitigation strategies."

Here we use a high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting convection-permitting model to simulate 23 summer convective storms over the subtropical city of Shanghai, China. We simulated these events in three different scenarios: present urban, no-urban, and urban-expansion settings. Results show contradictory findings of urbanization’s influence on convective rainfall, which is associated with urban-surroundings hydrothermal differences and diurnal cycles. Urban expansion further intensifies daytime convective rainfall when inhomogeneous temperature and moisture conditions between the city and its surroundings are present, whereas other conditions may suppress rainfall intensity. The findings provide the potential mechanisms of rainfall modification by urban expansion in subtropical cities, offering useful insights for urban planning and flood management in Shanghai and other rapidly urbanizing cities."

Existing studies mostly focus on changes in air temperature and tend to overlook soil temperature; however, changes in extreme heat in air and soil can be inconsistent under global change and water–carbon cycling may be more sensitive to soil condition. In this study, we examine the global pattern of long-term trends in the difference between air temperature and soil temperature (Tsoil − T2m) for the hottest month of the year during the period of 1961–2022. The results show that in certain hotspots, such as the middle and high latitudes of Eurasia, the Mediterranean, and the Western United States, the increasing trend in soil temperature has exceeded the increasing trend in 2 m air temperature during the warm season, implying that the land surface can contribute to the increase in air temperature extreme by releasing more heat than before. Our study suggest that the effect of soil temperature to air temperature is strongly related to the partitioning of surface latent heat, sensible heat (H) and soil heat flux (G). In the hot spots, Tsoil − T2m was significantly positively correlated with H and G while a significant negative correlation was found with evaporative fraction (EF) (p< 0.05), and the significant correlations with G and EF exhibit greater spatial heterogeneity. Moreover, the higher the degree of vegetation cover and soil moisture the smaller the difference between soil and air high temperatures. Therefore, changes in vegetation cover and land use management may play an important role in regulating the range of soil and air temperature differences as well as land-atmosphere coupling effects on heat extreme."

It is based on a microphysical model of cloud formation and may be applied to long-distance atmospheric transport models (> 100 km) and climatic models. This model is applied to the two most extreme precipitating cloud types in terms of both relative humidity and vertical extension: cumulonimbus and stratus. 
 With dry deposition and below-cloud scavenging, in-cloud scavenging is one of the three components of aerosol transfer from the atmosphere to the ground. There is no experimental validation of in-cloud particle scavenging models for all cloud types that is not impacted by uncertainties concerning below-cloud scavenging. In this article, the choice was made to start with a recognised and validated microphysical cloud formation model (the DEtailed SCAvenging Model, DESCAM) to extract a scheme of aerosol scavenging by clouds, valid for different cloud types. The resulting model works for the two most extreme precipitation clouds: from cumulonimbus to stratus. It is based on data accessible a priori from numerical weather prediction (NWP) outputs, i.e. the intensity of the rain and the relative humidity in the cloud. The diagnostic of the altitude of the cloud base proves to be a key parameter, and accuracy in this regard is vital. This new in-cloud scavenging scheme is intended for use in long-distance (> 100 km) atmospheric transport models (ATMs) or global climate models (GCMs)."
10.5194/acp-24-9615-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了美国中部山区一个偏远山顶站点的空气质量，重点关注了大气中氧化汞的浓度和来源。研究人员使用改进的测量系统，结合气象数据和轨迹模型，发现氧化汞在清洁干燥的自由对流层中含量较高，并与元素汞呈负相关。研究结果表明，氧化汞可能来自上风方向的氧化过程，并通过沉降或云层吸收在传输过程中积累。这项研究为理解大气中氧化汞的循环和命运提供了新的见解，并强调了提高大气汞测量准确性的重要性。,"['atmospheric mercury', 'oxidized mercury', 'air quality monitoring', 'remote sensing', 'mountaintop site', 'free troposphere', 'atmospheric composition', 'Lagrangian particle dispersion model', 'HYSPLIT-STILT']",Eleanor J.

Gratz,Elevated oxidized mercury in the free troposphere: analytical advances and application at a remote continental mountaintop site,"Mercury (Hg) is a globally distributed neurotoxic pollutant. Atmospheric deposition is the main source of Hg in ecosystems. However, measurement biases hinder understanding of the origins and abundance of the more bioavailable oxidized form. We used an improved, calibrated measurement system to study air mass composition and transport of atmospheric Hg at a remote mountaintop site in the central US. Oxidized Hg originated upwind in the low to middle free troposphere under clean, dry conditions. 
 Mercury (Hg) is a global atmospheric pollutant. In its oxidized form (HgII), it can readily deposit to ecosystems, where it may bioaccumulate and cause severe health effects. High HgII concentrations are reported in the free troposphere, but spatiotemporal data coverage is limited. Underestimation of HgII by commercially available measurement systems hinders quantification of Hg cycling and fate. During spring–summer 2021 and 2022, we measured elemental (Hg0) and oxidized Hg using a calibrated dual-channel system alongside trace gases, aerosol properties, and meteorology at the high-elevation Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) above Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Oxidized Hg concentrations displayed diel and episodic behavior similar to previous work at SPL but were approximately 3 times higher in magnitude due to improved measurement accuracy. We identified 18 multi-day events of elevated HgII (mean enhancement of 36 pg m−3) that occurred in dry air (mean ± SD of relative humidity = 32 ± 16 %). Lagrangian particle dispersion model (HYSPLIT–STILT, Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory–Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport) 10 d back trajectories showed that the majority of transport prior to events occurred in the low to middle free troposphere. Oxidized Hg was anticorrelated with Hg0 during events, with an average (± SD) slope of −0.39 ± 0.14. We posit that event HgII resulted from upwind oxidation followed by deposition or cloud uptake during transport. Meanwhile, sulfur dioxide measurements verified that three upwind coal-fired power plants did not influence ambient Hg at SPL. Principal component analysis showed HgII consistently inversely related to Hg0 and generally not associated with combustion tracers, confirming oxidation in the clean, dry free troposphere as its primary origin."
10.5194/acp-24-9555-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了城市地区挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）排放对臭氧生成的影响。研究人员利用韩国首尔地区的实地观测数据，发现现有排放清单低估了城市VOCs排放，特别是来自化学产品、液化石油气（LPG）和长距离传输的VOCs。通过改进VOCs排放清单和化学机制，研究人员使用GEOS-Chem化学传输模型模拟了臭氧、甲醛和过氧乙酰硝酸酯（PAN）的浓度，结果表明改进后的模型更能准确地模拟城市臭氧生成。研究还发现，乙醇排放对臭氧生成的贡献与异戊二烯或烯烃相当，并指出需要进一步研究氧化的VOCs（OVOCs）对臭氧生成的影响。,"['air quality', 'ozone', 'VOCs', 'satellite observations', 'chemical transport model', 'aircraft observations', 'atmospheric composition']",Katherine R.

Simpson;Kirk Ullman,Impact of improved representation of volatile organic compound emissions and production of NOx reservoirs on modeled urban ozone production,"Human activities result in the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to air pollution. Detailed VOC measurements were taken during a field study in South Korea. When compared to VOC inventories, large discrepancies showed underestimates from chemical products, liquefied petroleum gas, and long-range transport. Improved emissions and chemistry of these VOCs better described urban pollution. The new chemical scheme is relevant to urban areas and other VOC sources. 
 The fraction of urban volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions attributable to fossil fuel combustion has been declining in many parts of the world, resulting in a need to better constrain other anthropogenic sources of these emissions. During the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) field study in Seoul, South Korea, during May–June 2016, air quality models underestimated ozone, formaldehyde, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), indicating an underestimate of VOCs in the emissions inventory. Here, we use aircraft observations interpreted with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (version 13.4.0) to assess the need for increases in VOC emissions and for a revised chemical mechanism to improve treatment of VOC speciation and chemistry. We find that the largest needed VOC emissions increases are attributable to compounds associated with volatile chemical products, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas emissions, and long-range transport. Revising model chemistry to better match observed VOC speciation together with increasing model emissions of underestimated VOC species increased calculated OH reactivity by +2 s−1 and ozone production by +2 ppb h−1. Ozone increased by +6 ppb below 2 km and +9 ppb at the surface, and formaldehyde and acetaldehyde increased by +30 % and +120 % aloft, respectively, all in better agreement with observations. The larger increase in acetaldehyde was attributed to ethanol emissions, which we found to be as important for ozone production as isoprene or alkenes. The increased acetaldehyde significantly reduced the model PAN bias. The need for additional unmeasured VOCs, however, was indicated by a remaining model bias of −0.8 ppb in formaldehyde and a −57 % and −52 % underestimate in higher peroxynitrates (PNs) and alkyl nitrates (ANs), respectively. We added additional chemistry to the model to represent an additional six PNs from observed VOCs but were unable to account for the majority of missing PNs. However, four of these PNs were modeled at concentrations similar to other commonly measured PNs (> 2 % of PAN) indicating that these should be measured in future campaigns and considered from other VOC emission sources (e.g., fires). We hypothesize that emissions of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) such as ≥ C5 aldehydes from cooking and/or alkenes associated with volatile chemical products could produce both PNs and ANs and improve remaining model biases. Emerging research on the emissions and chemistry of these species will soon allow for modeling of their impact on local and regional photochemistry."

In this study, we introduce a practical chemical recovery strategy from PP waste using a mild catalyst-free hydrothermal treatment (HT). The treatment converts 64.1% of the processed PP into dissolved organic products within 2 h in an air atmosphere at 160 °C. Higher temperatures increase the PP conversion efficiency. Distinct electron absorption and emission characteristics of the products are identified by spectral analysis. Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) reveals the oxidative cracking of PP into shorter-chain homologues (10–50 carbon atoms) containing carboxylic and carbonyl groups. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support a reaction pathway involving thermal C–H oxidation at the tertiary carbon sites in the polymer chain. The addition of 1% H2O2 further enhances the oxidation reaction to produce valuable short-chain acetic acids, enabling gram-scale recycling of both pure PP and disposable surgical masks from the real world. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) and environmental life cycle costing (E-LCC) analysis suggest that this hydrothermal oxidation recovery technology is financially viable, which shows significant potential in tackling the ongoing plastic pollution crisis and advancing plastic treatment methodologies toward a circular economy paradigm."

MPs may be quickly eliminated after a brief retention in aquatic animals (such as the digestive tract); thus, understanding the damage caused by MPs during this process and whether the damage can be recovered is important. Here, we proposed the use of visible light imaging to track MPs combined with near-infrared (NIR) imaging to reveal the in situ impacts of MPs. The combination of these two techniques allows for the simultaneous investigation of the localization and functionality of MPs in vivo. We investigated the effects of two types of MPs on zebrafish, microplastic fibers (MFs) and microplastic beads (MBs). The results showed that MPs larger than 10 μm primarily accumulated in the intestines of zebrafish. Both MFs and MBs disrupted the redox balance of the intestine, and the location of the damage was consistent with the heterogeneous accumulation of MPs. MFs caused greater and more difficult-to-recover damage compared to MBs, which was closely related to the slower elimination rate of MFs. Our study highlights the importance of capturing the dynamic toxicological effects of MPs on organisms. Fibrous MPs and spherical MPs clearly had distinct effects on their toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics in fish."

Janssen,Tracking Extensive Portfolio of Cyanotoxins in Five-Year Lake Survey and Identifying Indicator Metabolites of Cyanobacterial Taxa,"Cyanobacterial blooms require monitoring, as they pose a threat to ecosystems and human health, especially by the release of toxins. Along with widely reported microcystins, cyanobacteria coproduce other bioactive metabolites; however, information about their dynamics in surface waters is sparse. We investigated dynamics across full bloom successions throughout a five-year lake monitoring campaign (Greifensee, Switzerland) spanning 150 sampling dates. We conducted extensive suspect screening of cyanobacterial metabolites using the database CyanoMetDB. Across all 850 samples, 35 metabolites regularly co-occurred. Microcystins were present in 70% of samples, with [d-Asp3,(E)-Dhb7]MC-RR reaching concentrations of 70 ng/L. Anabaenopeptins, meanwhile, were detected in 95% of all samples with concentrations of Oscillamide Y up to 100-fold higher than microcystins. Based on LC-MS response and frequency, we identified indicator metabolites exclusively produced by one of three cyanobacteria isolated from the lake, these being [d-Asp3,(E)-Dhb7]MC-RR from Planktothrix sp. G2020, Microginin 761B from Microcystis sp. G2011, and Ferintoic acid B from Microcystis sp. G2020. These indicators showed distinct temporal trends and peaking seasons that reflect the variance in either the abundance of the producing cyanobacteria or their toxin production dynamics. Our approach demonstrates that selecting high LC-MS response and frequent and species-specific indicator metabolites can be advantageous for cyanobacterial monitoring."

In addition, physical disturbances, such as floating granules (FGs), must be monitored manually. In this study, we present an eco-friendly, high-throughput methodology that uses near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) to build a machine-learning model for characterizing the chemical composition of the digestate and a target detection algorithm for identifying FGs. A total of 732 digestate samples were used to develop and validate a model for calculating total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), which are the chemical indicators of responses to disturbances in the AD process. Among these parameters, good model performance was obtained using the dried digestates data set, where the coefficient of determination (R2test) and the root-mean-square error (RMSEtest) were 0.82 and 1090 mg/L for TOC, and 0.86 and 690 mg/L for TN, respectively. Furthermore, the unique spectral features of the FGs in reactors with a lipid-rich substrate meant that they could also be identified by the HSI system. Based on these findings, developing NIR-HSI solutions to monitor the digestate properties in AD plants has great potential for industrial application."

This paper details the underlying code and data sets behind the visualization, with a major focus on the patent data sourced from PubChem, including patent origins, uses, and countries. Overall trends and specific examples are investigated in greater detail to explore both the promise and caveats that such data offer in assessing the trends and patterns of chemical patents over time and across different geographic regions. Despite a number of potential artifacts associated with patent data extraction, the integration of cheminformatics, statistical analysis, and data visualization tools can help generate valuable insights that can both illuminate the chemical past and potentially serve toward an early warning system for the future."

Advection is decomposed into terms related to the basic state of the atmosphere and transient eddies and compared against a non‐warming experiment. During summer, horizontal moisture advection increases mainly by transient eddies advecting moisture from the lower latitudes. During winter, enhanced evaporation due to reduced sea ice becomes a source of moisture diminishing the role of transient eddies moistening the atmosphere. This effect intensifies under extreme global warming, turning the change in total horizontal advection in the lower troposphere negative. Diminished horizontal advection during winter is counteracted by vertical advection accompanied with enhanced evaporation and upper‐level horizontal advection maintaining the increase in column moisture. These results improve our understanding of how the water cycle in the Arctic responds via atmospheric processes under global warming."

Conventionally, recovery is defined as a return to the pre‐disturbance state, assuming ecosystem stationarity. However, this view does not account for the impact of external forces like climate change, imposing non‐stationarity and trends. Alternatively, the counterfactual approach views recovery as the state the ecosystem would have achieved if the disturbance had not occurred, accounting for external forces. Here, we present a simple method to estimate the counterfactual recovery time. By implementing our method to the greening of the Arctic region, we showed that counterfactual greening recovery is twice as long as conventional recovery over the region. We argue that the well‐documented greening of the region acts as an external force, leading to such a large difference. We advocate for embracing the counterfactual definition of recovery, as it aligns with realistic decision‐making processes."

For a fixed collision kinetic energy (CKE), filament breakups can occur at all values of eccentricity but events of coalescence decrease, and that of sheet breakup increase with increasing eccentricity in absence of EH. However, as EH increases to ∼300 kVm−1 it opposes the variability of the coalescence and sheet breakup events with eccentricity. When EH exceeds ∼300 kVm−1 the collision outcomes might be determined only by the CKE and EH.

We find strong agreement of 2022 anomalies between the modeled and the measured data. The observed tracer‐tracer relations between nitrous oxide (N2O) and HCl indicate a significant role of chemical processing in the observed HCl reduction, especially during the austral winter of 2022. Further examining the roles of chlorine gas‐phase and heterogeneous chemistry, we find that heterogeneous chemistry emerges as the primary driver for the chemical loss of HCl, and the reaction between hypobromous acid (HOBr) and HCl on sulfate aerosols is the dominant loss process."

However, the characteristics and mechanisms of these changes are not yet fully understood. Here, we find that the impact of La Niña on nIOD has considerably weakened since 1999, with the frequency of nIOD occurrences during La Niña years plummeting to a mere one‐third of the pre‐1999 levels. This is primarily attributed to the early onset of Indian summer monsoon and the decrease in La Niña intensity, while the effect of variations in Bjerknes feedback is relatively minor. Model simulations suggest that the influence of La Niña on nIOD will continue to weaken under future global warming through similar mechanisms as in the observations, increasing the complexity of air‐sea coupling in the Indian Ocean."

Marine cloud brightening (MCB), one such approach, proposes to inject sea‐salt aerosol into one or more regional marine boundary layer to increase marine cloud reflectivity. Here, we assess the potential influence of various MCB experiments on Africa's climate using simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6) as its atmospheric component. We analyzed four idealized MCB experiments under a medium‐range background forcing scenario (SSP2‐4.5), which brighten clouds over three subtropical ocean regions: (a) Northeast Pacific (MCBNEP); (b) Southeast Pacific (MCBSEP); (c) Southeast Atlantic (MCBSEA); and (d) these three regions simultaneously (MCBALL). Our results suggest that the climate impacts of MCB in Africa are highly sensitive to the deployment region. MCBSEP would produce the strongest global cooling effect and thus could be the most effective in decreasing temperatures, increasing precipitation, and reducing the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes across most parts of Africa, especially West Africa, in the future (2035–2054) compared to the historical climate (1995–2014). MCB in other regions produces less cooling and wetting despite similar radiative forcings. While the projected changes under MCBALL are similar to those of MCBSEP, MCBNEP and MCBSEA could see more residual warming and induce a warmer future than under SSP2‐4.5 in some regions across Africa. All MCB experiments are more effective in cooling maximum temperature and related extremes than minimum temperature and related extremes."

A significantly increasing trend in the intensity and frequency of humid‐heat nights has been observed in eastern China from 1961 to 2014. Detection analyses show that the fingerprinting of anthropogenic forcing, in which the greenhouse gas forcing is critical, can be identified for changes in the humid‐heat nights in eastern China. However, the roles of anthropogenic aerosols and external natural forcings cannot be detected, and their effects on the observed changes in humid‐heat nights over eastern China are generally negligible. Under different warming scenarios, there is a projected continuation of increasing intensity and frequency of humid‐heat nights, although the magnitudes are reduced after constraining. In eastern China, the areal mean intensity of humid‐heat nights is projected to increase by approximately 0.9, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5°C (relative to 1995–2014) for 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0°C global warming, while the occurrence of extreme humid‐heat night is 1.1, 1.2, 1.2, and 1.3 times more than the current period. Moreover, the population exposed to humid‐heat nights in eastern China, particularly in the northern regions, is expected to increase in the future.

This protocol has been successfully applied to the synthesis of 13 highly deuterated drug molecules. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the Ru-D species, generated by electrolysis of D2O in the presence of nitrogen-doped Ru electrode, are key intermediates that directly reduce aromatic compounds.

 The selective cross-coupling of two alkyl electrophiles to construct complex molecules remains a challenge in organic synthesis.1,2 Known reactions are optimized for specific electrophiles and are not amenable to interchangeably varying electrophilic substrates that are sourced from common alkyl building blocks, such as amines, carboxylic acids, and halides.3–5 These limitations restrict the types of alkyl substrates that can be modified and, ultimately, the chemical space that can be explored.6 Here we report a general solution to these limitations that enables a combinatorial approach to alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling reactions. This methodology relies on the discovery of unusually persistent Ni(alkyl) complexes that can be formed directly by oxidative addition of alkyl halides, redox-active esters, or pyridinium salts. The resulting alkyl complexes can be isolated or directly telescoped to couple with a second alkyl electrophile, which represent cross-selective reactions that were previously unknown. The utility of this synthetic capability is showcased in the rapid diversification of amino acids, natural products, pharmaceuticals, and drug-like building blocks by various combinations of dehalogenative, decarboxylative, or deaminative coupling. In addition to a robust scope, this work provides insights into the organometallic chemistry of synthetically relevant Ni(alkyl) complexes through crystallographic analysis, stereochemical probes, and spectroscopic studies."

 Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen. Its RNA genome consists of two negative-sense segments (L and M) with one gene each, and one ambisense segment (S) with two opposing genes separated by the noncoding “intergenic region” (IGR). These vRNAs and the complementary cRNAs are encapsidated by nucleoprotein (N). Using iCLIP2 (individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) to map all N-vRNA and N-cRNA interactions, we detect N coverage along the L and M segments. However, the S segment vRNA and cRNA each contain approximately 100 non-encapsidated nucleotides stretching from the IGR into the 5’-adjacent reading frame. These exposed regions are RNase-sensitive and predicted to form stem-loop structures with the mRNA transcription termination motif positioned near the top. Moreover, optimal S segment transcription and replication requires the entire exposed region rather than only the IGR. Thus, the RVFV S segment contains a central, non-encapsidated RNA region with a functional role. Rift Valley fever virus is a WHO-prioritized zoonotic pathogen.

 Transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers possess large exciton binding energy and a robust valley degree of freedom, making them a viable platform for the development of spintronic devices capable of operating at room temperature. The development of such monolayer TMD-based spintronic devices requires strong spin-dependent interactions and effective spin transport. This can be achieved by employing exciton-polaritons. These hybrid light-matter states arising from the strong coupling of excitons and photons allow high-speed in-plane propagation and strong nonlinear interactions.

We demonstrate spin-anisotropic polariton nonlinear interactions in a WS2 superlattice at room temperature. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize these spin-dependent interactions to implement different spin switch geometries at ambient conditions, which show intrinsic sub-picosecond switching time and small footprint. Our findings offer new perspectives on manipulations of the polarization state in polaritonic systems and highlight the potential of atomically thin semiconductors for the development of next generation information processing devices.

 Entangled photon-pair sources are at the core of quantum applications like quantum key distribution, sensing, and imaging. Operation in space-limited and adverse environments such as in satellite-based and mobile communication requires robust entanglement sources with minimal size and weight requirements. Here, we meet this challenge by realizing a cubic micrometer scale entangled photon-pair source in a 3R-stacked transition metal dichalcogenide crystal. Its crystal symmetry enables the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states without additional components and provides tunability by simple control of the pump polarization. Remarkably, generation rate and state tuning are decoupled, leading to equal generation efficiency and no loss of entanglement. Combining transition metal dichalcogenides with monolithic cavities and integrated photonic circuitry or using quasi-phasematching opens the gate towards ultrasmall and scalable quantum devices.

 Resistance to stress is a key determinant for mammalian functioning. While many studies have revealed neural circuits and substrates responsible for initiating and mediating stress responses, little is known about how the brain resists to stress and prevents overreactions. Here, we identified a previously uncharacterized neuropeptide Y (NPY) neuronal population in the dorsal raphe nucleus and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray region (DRN/vlPAG) with anxiolytic effects in male mice. NPYDRN/vlPAG neurons are rapidly activated by various stressful stimuli. Inhibiting these neurons exacerbated hypophagic and anxiety responses during stress, while activation significantly ameliorates acute stress-induced hypophagia and anxiety levels and transmits positive valence. Furthermore, NPYDRN/vlPAG neurons exert differential but synergic anxiolytic effects via inhibitory projections to the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) and the lateral hypothalamic area (LH). Together, our findings reveal a feedforward inhibition neural mechanism underlying stress resistance and suggest NPYDRN/vlPAG neurons as a potential therapeutic target for stress-related disorders.

 Interrupting transmission events is critical to tuberculosis control. Cough-generated aerosol cultures predict tuberculosis transmission better than microbiological or clinical markers. We hypothesize that highly infectious individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (positive for cough aerosol cultures) have elevated inflammatory markers and unique transcriptional profiles compared to less infectious individuals. We performed a prospective, longitudinal study using cough aerosol sampling system. We enrolled 142 participants with treatment-naïve pulmonary tuberculosis in Kenya and assessed the association of clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic characteristics with Mycobacterium tuberculosis aerosolization and transmission in 129 household members. Contacts of the forty-three aerosol culture-positive participants (30%) are more likely to have a positive interferon-gamma release assay (85% vs 53%, P = 0.006) and higher median IFNγ level (P < 0.001, 4.28 IU/ml (1.77-5.91) vs. 0.71 (0.01-3.56)) compared to aerosol culture-negative individuals. We find that higher bacillary burden, younger age, larger mean upper arm circumference, and host inflammatory profiles, including elevated serum C-reactive protein and lower plasma TNF levels, associate with positive cough aerosol cultures. Notably, we find pre-treatment whole blood transcriptional profiles associate with aerosol culture status, independent of bacillary load. These findings suggest that tuberculosis infectiousness is associated with epidemiologic characteristics and inflammatory signatures and that these features may identify highly infectious persons.

 Converting solar energy into fuels is pursued as an attractive route to reduce dependence on fossil fuel. In this context, photothermal catalysis is a very promising approach through converting photons into heat to drive catalytic reactions. There are mainly three key factors that govern the photothermal catalysis performance: maximized solar absorption, minimized thermal emission and excellent catalytic property of catalyst. However, the previous research has focused on improving solar absorption and catalytic performance of catalyst, largely neglected the optimization of thermal emission. Here, we demonstrate an optically selective catalyst based Ti3C2Tx Janus design, that enables minimized thermal emission, maximized solar absorption and good catalytic activity simultaneously, thereby achieving excellent photothermal catalytic performance. When applied to Sabatier reaction and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) as demonstrations, we obtain an approximately 300% increase in catalytic yield through reducing the thermal emission of catalyst by ~70% under the same irradiation intensity. It is worth noting that the CO2 methanation yield reaches 3317.2 mmol gRu−1 h−1 at light power of 2 W cm−2, setting a performance record among catalysts without active supports. We expect that this design opens up a new pathway for the development of high-performance photothermal catalysts.

Here, the authors demonstrate an optically selective catalyst based on a Ti3C2Tx Janus design which minimizes thermal emission, maximizes solar absorption, and maintains good catalytic activity, resulting in excellent photothermal catalytic performance."

 Realizing a sensitive photon-number-dependent phase shift on a light beam is required both in classical and quantum photonics. It may lead to new applications for classical and quantum photonics machine learning or pave the way for realizing photon-photon gate operations. Nonlinear phase-shifts require efficient light-matter interaction, and recently quantum dots coupled to nanophotonic devices have enabled near-deterministic single-photon coupling. We experimentally realize an optical phase shift of 0.19π ± 0.03 radians ( ≈ 34 degrees) using a weak coherent state interacting with a single quantum dot in a planar nanophotonic waveguide. The phase shift is probed by interferometric measurements of the light scattered from the quantum dot in the waveguide. The process is nonlinear in power, the saturation at the single-photon level and compatible with scalable photonic integrated circuitry. The work may open new prospects for realizing high-efficiency optical switching or be applied for proof-of-concept quantum machine learning or quantum simulation demonstrations.

 Ageing is the accumulation of changes and decline of function of organisms over time. The concept and biomarkers of biological age have been established, notably DNA methylation-based clocks. The emergence of single-cell DNA methylation profiling methods opens the possibility of studying the biological age of individual cells. Here, we generate a large single-cell DNA methylation and transcriptome dataset from mouse peripheral blood samples, spanning a broad range of ages. The number of genes expressed increases with age, but gene-specific changes are small. We next develop scEpiAge, a single-cell DNA methylation age predictor, which can accurately predict age in (very sparse) publicly available datasets, and also in single cells. DNA methylation age distribution is wider than technically expected, indicating epigenetic age heterogeneity and functional differences.

 Aerosol hygroscopic behavior plays a central role in determining climate effects and environmental influence of atmospheric particulates. Water-soluble organic acids (WSOAs) constitute a significant fraction of organic aerosols. These organic acids have a complex impact on aerosol hygroscopicity due to their physical and chemical interactions with atmospheric inorganic salts. The mixing of WSOAs with inorganic salts exerts a multiple influence on the hygroscopic growth and phase behaviors of aerosol particles, largely depending on the composition ratio, acid properties, particle size and interactions between particle components. The WSOAs play a critical role in determining water uptake characteristics of aerosol particles, especially in the low and moderate RH ranges. The previous studies reveal the occurrence of aerosol chemistry related to chloride/nitrate/ammonium depletions in aerosol droplets containing WSOAs and inorganic salts. The potential influence of WSOAs on the atmospheric recycling of HCl/HNO3/NH3 due to the chloride/nitrate/ammonium depletion may contribute to the atmospheric budget of reactive gases. A fundamental understanding for the hygroscopic behavior and aerosol chemistry of inorganic–WSOA systems is essential for the accurate parameterization of aerosol behaviors in atmospheric models. However, there is still lack of a comprehensive understanding of the hygroscopicity and related aerosol chemistry of internally mixed inorganic–WSOA systems. The present review comprehensively summarizes the impacts of WSOAs on hygroscopicity and phase changes of atmospherically relevant inorganic salts in aerosol particles especially under subsaturated conditions, and overviews the recent advances on aerosol chemistry related to the hygroscopic process for the internally mixed inorganic–WSOA aerosols."

 Electric vehicles are promoted as ‘clean’ technologies and offer promising reductions in transportation emissions. Nevertheless, their environmental benefits critically depend on the local electricity grid mix and the type of emission being considered. Here, we conduct a comparative life cycle assessment of the four dominant light-duty vehicle categories at both the global scale and in three representative countries: Norway, the US, and China. By analyzing different environmental indicators, particularly global warming potential and respiratory effects, and quantifying related parametric uncertainties, we reveal that the advantages of electric vehicles vary across these regions and across environmental impact types. While electric vehicles offer considerable decarbonization potential as the grid mix becomes cleaner, they might not mitigate other environmental impacts, such as increased respiratory effects on rural, low-income communities. Our results support stakeholders in identifying environmentally friendly vehicle and policy options while considering multiple factors, and emphasize the importance of tailored approaches over one-size-fits-all solutions in sustainable transportation.

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a subtle but informative probe of plant photosynthesis. Quantifying the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of SIF benefits a better understanding of photosynthesis variations over heterogeneous canopies. Although radiative transfer models (RTMs) provide a solid theoretical basis for simulating the 3D SIF distribution, most RTMs use virtual scenes with complex reconstruction processes. This study aims to develop a 3D SIF simulation model (FluorLiDAR) directly driven by terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data using leaf and canopy RTMs, including a 3D PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) simulation model, the Fluspect model, the atmosphere radiative transfer module in SCOPE, and the multiple scattering coefficients of sunlit and shaded leaves from the 4-scale model. The results show that (1) the simulated and measured SIF patterns were consistent, with R2 (RMSE) values of 0.73 (0.17 mW/nm/m2/sr) and 0.76 (0.12 mW/nm/m2/sr) for 1-min sampling and 10-min averages, respectively. Moreover, the R2 between FluorLiDAR and the DART simulation reached 0.94. The R2 of FluorLiDAR and DART were both higher than 1D mSCOPE using every 10-min sampling data. (2) Point density, denoted by average NPD (nearest point distance), influenced the performance of our model mainly when it was smaller than 0.1 m. Chlorophyll content had less influence on the model accuracy (R2 and rRMSE), and the bias between simulation and measurement decreased as chlorophyll content increased. (3) The simulated 3D SIF distribution pattern closely resembled PAR within the canopy. Besides, FluorLiDAR can simulate the hot spot effect like DART and mSCOPE though the effect was not as obvious as the other two models. This study highlights the potential of a LiDAR-driven SIF model for 3D SIF simulation over a heterogeneous canopy, which may benefit the understanding of the structural impacts on forest photosynthesis in real forest scenes."

 We developed the SCARF (Spatial Mismatch and Systematic Prediction Error Corrected cAscade Random Forests) algorithm for continuous prediction of biomass dynamics using machine learning and Landsat Time Series (LTS). Our approach addresses the challenges posed by the cloudy subtropical forests in southern China, where monitoring biomass dynamics is notoriously difficult. To derive spectral-temporal features from the LTS, we applied the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014). Subsequently, we employed the cascade random forests machine learning algorithm for biomass prediction. This new approach corrects the spatial mismatch effects between plots and Landsat pixels as well as the systematic prediction errors in the machine learning model. As a result, it substantially enhances biomass prediction accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.83 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.27 Mg ha-1. In comparison, the commonly used random forests approach yields an R2 of 0.47 and RMSE of 8.52 Mg ha-1. Additionally, it provides reliable spatial prediction beyond the model-training area, achieving an R2 of 0.79 and an RMSE of 6.62 Mg ha-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modeling five different forest age groups separately further improves prediction accuracies, resulting in an increased R2 of 0.87 and a reduced RMSE of 3.65 Mg ha-1. A comparison of the allometric model prediction from the field plots and those from the SCARF model revealed a strong agreement, indicating that this approach can provide a temporally continuous prediction of biomass dynamics. Our study presents a robust method for continuous, reliable, and explicit spatiotemporal prediction of biomass dynamics in cloudy subtropical forests using LTS."

 Phase unwrapping is the process of retrieving the true phase values from observed wrapped phases by adding the correct multiples of 2π. This process is crucial in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry, and numerous studies have aimed to enhance its performance. This study explored phase unwrapping using a modified U-Net regression model by optimizing both the network structure and training data. For network structure optimization, the study first compared model performance based on the size ratio of the lowest feature maps, determined by the number of pooling layers, to the size of convolutional kernels. A multi-kernel U-Net structure was developed to ensure robustness against variations in phase noise and gradient, compared to a standard single-kernel U-Net. Regarding the training data, data augmentation was implemented to address imbalances and better represent the local noise characteristics found in actual SAR interferograms. The training data was simulated to include local noise effects based on coherence measurements from real SAR data, as well as simple noise used for benchmarking the unwrapping performance with different training datasets. The results indicated that when the convolutional kernel size is smaller than the feature map size at the lowest layer, increasing the number of pooling layers leads to improvements in unwrapping performance. Conversely, performance decreased when the feature map size at the lowest layers was smaller than the convolutional kernel size. Specifically, the single-kernel U-Net with six pooling layers and the multi-kernel U-Net with five pooling layers exhibited the best unwrapping performance. Considering both simulated and real synthetic aperture radar interferogram data, the mean absolute errors for the single- and multi-kernel U-Net trained with simple noise were approximately 0.235 and 0.254, respectively. In contrast, for models trained with locally variable noise simulation data, the MAEs dropped to about 0.033 and 0.032, showing an improvement by approximately eightfold over models trained with simple noise. For real synthetic aperture radar interferograms, the mean absolute errors were 0.542 (single-kernel U-Net trained using simple noise), 0.592 (multi-kernel U-Net trained using simple noise), 0.542 (single-kernel U-Net trained using local noise), and 0.445 (proposed), respectively, underscoring the significant impact of training data on unwrapping performance. The study also evaluated the performance of the statistical-cost, network-flow algorithm for phase unwrapping (SNAPHU), obtaining mean absolute errors of about 0.043 for simulation data and 0.861 for real SAR data. Consequently, the multi-kernel model trained with locally different noise simulation data demonstrated roughly twice the performance compared to the traditional phase unwrapping method."

 Detailed population maps play an important role in diverse fields ranging from humanitarian action to urban planning. Generating such maps in a timely and scalable manner presents a challenge, especially in data-scarce regions. To address it we have developed Popcorn, a population mapping method whose only inputs are free, globally available satellite images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2; and a small number of aggregate population counts over coarse census districts for calibration. Despite the minimal data requirements our approach surpasses the mapping accuracy of existing schemes, including several that rely on building footprints derived from high-resolution imagery. E.g., we were able to produce population maps for Rwanda with 100m GSD based on less than 400 regional census counts. In Kigali, those maps reach an R2 score of 66% w.r.t. a ground truth reference map, with an average error of only ±10 inhabitants/ha. Conveniently, Popcorn retrieves explicit maps of built-up areas and local building occupancy rates, making the mapping process interpretable and offering additional insights, for instance about the distribution of built-up, but unpopulated areas, e.g., industrial warehouses. With our work we aim to democratize access to up-to-date and high-resolution population maps, recognizing that some regions faced with particularly strong population dynamics may lack the resources for costly micro-census campaigns.
