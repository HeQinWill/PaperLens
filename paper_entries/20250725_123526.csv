We apply a storyline approach to identify coherent narratives of the spatial patterns of heatwave days in the contiguous United States (CONUS) in a 3 °C warmer climate. We use daily temperature data from the seamless system for prediction and earth system research large-ensemble climate model under the shared socio-economic pathway 5–8.5. We find that CONUS surpasses the 3 °C-warming threshold (relative to 1921–1950) between the mid-2020s and early 2040s across all 30 ensemble members. Despite similar spatial patterns of annual mean surface temperatures over the CONUS in the 3 °C-crossing years, the simulated heatwave days are clustered into four distinct spatial patterns: Southeastern, Mountain-Central, Western-Severe, and Western-Mild. The Western-Mild pattern is the most frequent (19 out of 30 realizations) with the fewest annual heatwave days, while the remaining patterns tend to experience a greater number of annual heatwave days and are less common (3 or 4 out of 30). We present four case studies corresponding to the representative clusters to better understand local extreme heat storylines, highlighting how the maximum annual mean temperature at the local scale might differ from the continental scale. Specifically, we find very severe potential conditions in the 3 °C-passing years with parts of the US potentially experiencing more than 150 cumulative heatwave days. This study implies that careful consideration of local temperature changes will be necessary to provide various climate adaptation policy perspectives."

An observational study,"Despite the growing evidence on the associations between greenspace and violent crime, there is a lack of research on the urban greenspace’s influence on the associations between ambient temperature and violent crime. This observational study examined the risk differences by community’s greenspace level using various greenspace indicators. Our time-series analysis modeled the associations between daily mean temperature (°C) over two lag days (lag0–1) and daily counts of violent crime during summer (May–September) in each ZIP code in Chicago, IL (2001–2023), adjusting for confounding factors. Our random-effects meta analysis analyzed estimated the pooled relative risk (RR) at the 80th summer temperature percentile compared to the reference temperature (10th percentile) across the ZIP codes. Our meta-regressions analyzed how the ZIP code-specific relative risks (RRs) differ by the number of parks, sum of park areas, percentage of vegetated area, percentage of recreational vegetated area, vegetation density (30 m), percent tree coverage, and percent street-level tree coverage aggregated at the ZIP code level. A total of 1075 959 counts of violent crime were included in our analysis. We found 8% (95% CI: 7%–10%) higher risk of violent crime incidents when the daily mean temperature was at the 80th percentile (25.9 °C) compared to the reference temperature (8.6 °C). The pooled RR was significantly lower in ZIP codes with the highest vegetation density (RR = 1.085 [95% CI: 1.040–1.131]) compared to those with the lowest vegetated density (RR = 1.124 [1.088–1.162]). The RR was significantly lower in ZIP codes with the highest percentage of tree coverage (RR = 1.088 [1.046–1.132]) compared to the ZIP codes with the lowest percentage of tree coverage (RR = 1.123 [1.086–1.162]). The observed results indicate that greenspace can be beneficial in reducing the associations between heat and violent crime. The results should be considered in urban greenery planning and policies to reduce violent crime."

While atmospheric CO2 mole fraction measurements can be used to assess CUP changes, atmospheric transport and asynchronous timing across regions reduce the accuracy of the estimates. Forward model experiments show that only ~ 50 % of prescribed shifts in CUP timing applied to surface fluxes (ΔCUPNEE) are captured in simulated CO2 mole fraction data at monitoring sites like the Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory. 
 The carbon uptake period (CUP) refers to the time of each year during which the rate of photosynthetic uptake surpasses that of respiration in the terrestrial biosphere, resulting in a net absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere to the land. Since climate drivers influence both photosynthesis and respiration, the CUP offers valuable insights into how the terrestrial biosphere responds to climate variations and affects the carbon budget. Several studies have assessed large-scale changes in CUP based on seasonal metrics from CO2 mole fraction measurements. However, an in-depth understanding of the sensitivity of the CUP as derived from the CO2 mole fraction data (CUPMR) to actual changes in the CUP of the net ecosystem exchange (CUPNEE) is missing. In this study, we specifically assess the impact of (i) atmospheric transport, (ii) interannual variability in CUPNEE, and (iii) regional contribution to the signals that integrate at different background sites where CO2 dry air mole fraction measurements are made. We conducted idealized simulations where we imposed known changes (Δ) to the CUPNEE in the Northern Hemisphere to test the effect of the aforementioned factors in CUPMR metrics at 10 Northern Hemisphere sites. Our analysis indicates a significant damping of changes in the simulated ΔCUPMR due to the integration of signals with varying CUPNEE timing across regions. CUPMR at well-studied sites such as Mauna Loa, Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow), and Alert showed only 50 % of the applied ΔCUPNEE under non-interannually varying atmospheric transport conditions. Further, our synthetic analyses conclude that interannual variability (IAV) in atmospheric transport accounts for a significant part of the changes in the observed signals. However, even after separating the contribution of transport IAV, the estimates of surface changes in CUP by previous studies are not likely to provide an accurate magnitude of the actual changes occurring over the surface. The observed signal experiences significant damping as the atmosphere averages out non-synchronous signals from various regions."
10.5194/acp-25-7815-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了中国东南沿海城市中ClNO2（氯化亚硝酰）的形成机制和光化学效应。研究发现，夜间N2O5（五氧化二氮）的非均相吸收是ClNO2的主要来源，而硝酸盐的光解可能促进白天ClNO2浓度的升高。此外，氯自由基对烷烃的氧化速率在清晨超过了羟基自由基，显著促进了ROx和臭氧的形成，进一步提高了大气氧化能力。该研究结合了机器学习和模型模拟，揭示了影响ClNO2的关键因素，并分析了其对大气的影响，为沿海地区光化学污染的调控提供了有价值的见解。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究对象和结论与大气成分分析、空气质量监测等遥感应用密切相关。,"['ClNO2', 'N2O5', 'NO3-', 'O3', 'VOC', 'Photochemical pollution', 'Atmospheric oxidation capacity', 'UV radiation']",Gaojie Chen;Xiaolong Fan;Haichao Wang;Yee Jun Tham;Ziyi Lin;Xiaoting Ji;Lingling Xu;Baoye Hu;Jinsheng Chen,Formation drivers and photochemical effects of ClNO2 in a coastal city of Southeast China,"Our study revealed that the nighttime heterogeneous dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) uptake process was the major contributor of nitryl chloride (ClNO2) sources, while nitrate photolysis may promote the elevation of daytime ClNO2 concentrations. The rates of alkane oxidation by chlorine (Cl) radical in the early morning exceeded those by OH radical, significantly promoted the formation of ROx and ozone (O3), and further enhanced the atmospheric oxidation capacity levels. 
 Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) is an important precursor of chlorine (Cl) radical, significantly affecting ozone (O3) formation and photochemical oxidation. However, the key drivers of ClNO2 production are not fully understood. In this study, the field observations of ClNO2 and related parameters were conducted in a coastal city of Southeast China during the autumn of 2022, combining with machine learning and model simulations to elucidate its key influencing factors and atmospheric impacts. Elevated concentrations of ClNO2 (>500 ppt) were notably observed during nighttime in late autumn, accompanied by increased levels of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) and nitrate (NO3-). Nighttime concentrations of ClNO2 peaked at 3.4 ppb, while its daytime levels remained significant, reaching up to 100 ppt and sustaining at approximately 40 ppt at noon. Machine learning and field observations identified nighttime N2O5 heterogeneous uptake as the predominant pathway for ClNO2 production, whereas NO3- photolysis may contribute to its daytime generation. Additionally, ambient temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) emerged as primary meteorological factors affecting ClNO2 formation, mainly through their effects on thermal equilibrium and N2O5 hydrolysis processes, respectively. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation was found to play a dual role in ClNO2 concentrations around noon. Box model simulations showed that, under high-ClNO2 conditions, the rates of alkane oxidation by Cl radical in the early morning exceeded those by OH radical. Consequently, volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation by Cl radical contributed ∼19 % to ROx production rates, thereby significantly impacting O3 formation and atmospheric oxidation capacity. This research enriched the understanding of ClNO2 generation and loss pathways, providing valuable insights for the regulation of photochemical pollution in coastal regions."

We found that a new type of data from the Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite (GOSAT), which contains information about methane in the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere, could provide reliable estimates of recent methane emissions when combined with atmospheric modelling. Therefore, the use of such data is encouraged to improve emission quantification methods and advance our understanding of methane cycles. 
 Satellite-driven inversions provide valuable information about methane (CH4) fluxes, but the assimilation of total column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CH4 (XCH4) has been challenging. This study explores, for the first time, the potential of the new lower-tropospheric partial column (pXCH4_LT) GOSAT data, retrieved by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), to constrain global and regional CH4 fluxes. Using the CarbonTracker Europe-CH4 (CTE-CH4) atmospheric inverse model, we estimated CH4 fluxes between 2016–2019 by assimilating the JAXA/GOSAT pXCH4_LT and XCH4 data and surface CH4 observations independently of each other. The Northern Hemisphere CH4 fluxes derived from the pXCH4_LT data were similar to the estimates derived from the surface observations but were underestimated by about 35 Tg CH4 yr−1 (∼ 6 % of the global total) using the XCH4 data. For the Southern Hemisphere, the estimates from both GOSAT inversions were about 15–30 Tg CH4 yr−1 higher than those derived from surface data. The evaluations against independent data from the Atmospheric Tomography Mission aircraft campaign showed good agreement in the lower-tropospheric CH4 from the inversions using the pXCH4_LT and surface data. However, from these inversions, the modelled north–south gradients showed significant overestimation in the upper troposphere and stratosphere, possibly due to relatively uniform inter-hemispheric OH distributions that control CH4 sinks. Overall, we found that the use of the JAXA/GOSAT pXCH4_LT data shows considerable potential in constraining global and regional CH4 fluxes, advancing our understanding of the CH4 budget."

However, inconsistencies between measurements and radiative transfer simulations were found recently, and, so far, there has been no consensus on how to deal with these appropriately. In this study, long-term long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) observations were analysed and very good agreement with laboratory measurements was found. 
 Absorption of light in the atmosphere by collision-induced absorption (CIA) by two oxygen molecules O2–O2, in the following referred to as O4, can be used to derive properties of aerosols and clouds from remote sensing observations. In recent years, inconsistencies between the measured atmospheric O4 absorption and radiative transfer simulations were found for Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements. In the presented study, over two years of observations from a long-path (LP-) DOAS instrument deployed at the German research station Neumayer, Antarctica, are analysed. While MAX-DOAS instruments measure spectra of scattered sunlight at different elevation angles, LP-DOAS utilises an artificial light source and the atmospheric absorptions are measured along a fixed (and well-defined) light path close to the surface. Further, the pristine measurement location allows one to investigate the relation between measured and modelled O4 absorption over a large range of temperatures (−45 to +5 °C). Overall good agreement is found between the retrieved O4 absorption cross-sections covering the absorption band at 360 nm and laboratory measurements. While the best agreement is obtained for the Finkenzeller and Volkamer (2022) cross-sections, deviations at cold ambient temperatures (below ca. −25 °C) are observed for the Thalman and Volkamer (2013) cross-sections. Other O4 absorption bands could not be investigated because these are not (fully) within the spectral range of the measured spectra. This study strongly supports the accuracy of commonly used O4 absorption cross-sections in DOAS analyses, while more work is needed to understand the earlier reported inconsistencies in MAX-DOAS observations."

This study generates a dataset of high-resolution divergence and vorticity profiles using the measurements of a radar wind profiler mesonet in Beijing. The negative divergence and positive vorticity are present ahead of rainfall events. This suggests that this dataset can help improve our understanding of the pre-storm environment and has the potential to be applied in weather forecasting. 
 Low-level convergence and cyclonic circulation are one of the most important dynamic variables in governing the initiation and development of convective storms. Our ability to obtain high-resolution horizontal divergence and vertical vorticity profiles, nevertheless, remains limited largely due to the lack of vertical wind observations. To fill this data gap, a high-density mesonet consisting of six radar wind profiler (RWP) sites has been operated in Beijing, which has allowed for continuous observations of three-dimensional winds with high vertical resolution. This paper aims to produce a temporally continuous horizontal divergence and vertical vorticity dataset at the vertical resolution of 120 m, which is derived from horizontal winds measured by the RWP mesonet in Beijing using the triangle method. This dataset is generated at intervals of 6 min for the whole year of 2023, covering the altitude range of 0.51–4.11 km. The dynamic variables from RWP mesonet are found to scatter sharply as opposed to those from ERA5 that are concentrated around zero, especially at high altitudes. In particular, the negative divergence and positive vorticity are detected in the low-level troposphere up to 1 h in advance of the occurrence of rainfall events, and their magnitudes increasingly become greater when the time comes closer to the rainfall onset, exhibiting the key role that the dataset plays in rainfall nowcasting. This is indicative of, to some extent, the effectiveness of the high-resolution divergence and vorticity dataset in Beijing. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15297246 (Guo and Guo, 2024), which is of significance for a multitude of scientific research and applications, including convection initiation and air quality forecasting. Therefore, the findings highlight the urgent need for exploiting the dynamic variables from RWP mesonet measurements to better characterize the pre-storm environment."

This dataset can help understand the effects of disturbances, land-use changes, and extreme events on global carbon cycle, and enhance the representation of these processes in Earth System Models. 
 Understanding global carbon dynamics and budgets under climate change, land-use shifts, and increasing disturbances re- mains challenging due to the limitations of existing coarse spatial resolution and short-term or discontinuous biomass datasets. In this study, we generated a new global annual above-ground biomass carbon (AGC) dataset at 8 km spatial resolution from 1993 to 2020. This dataset is derived from satellite radar backscatter data and integrates vegetation and climate information, such as tree cover, tree density, and background climate data, to enhance the accuracy of global AGC mapping. Our dataset estimates an average global above-ground carbon stock of 378 PgC, aligning with other global estimates. We observe a slight gross increase of 1.18 PgC in global vegetation above-ground biomass carbon stocks from 1993 to 2020, with relatively stable variation. This reflects a balance between above-ground biomass carbon gains and losses across different biomes. Temperate and boreal forests are the primary contributors to global vegetation above-ground biomass carbon gains from 1993 to 2020, with increases of 0.4 and 0.5 PgC, respectively. In contrast, gross above-ground biomass carbon losses are predominantly observed in global tropical forests (-10.7 PgC) and global shrublands (-1.0 PgC). This suggests non-forest vegetation may offset the large above-ground biomass losses in tropical forests. Notably, El Niño events in 2015/16 triggered significant pantropical AGC losses of approximately -2.86 PgC, and regions with reported tree mortality events (Hammond et al., 2022) exhibited local AGC density declines of -0.34 MgC/ha. This long-term, temporally continuous, and moderate-resolution dataset provides a valuable resource for understanding biomass carbon dynamics and integrating these processes into Earth System Models. The AGC dataset is openly accessible, alongside with this manuscript."

However, the consistency across the increasing suite of datasets is unclear, limiting the comparability of findings derived from different datasets and variables. We find overall low consistency of numerous state-of-the-art precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture datasets in terms of the water balance. Meanwhile, the water balance consistency varies across space, sources, variables, and time. 
 The proliferation and diversification of hydrological datasets have significantly advanced hydrological research. However, the coherence across these datasets remains poorly understood, hindering the comparability of findings derived from different data sources and variables. Here, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art hydrological datasets exhibit overall low consistency when evaluated through the lens of water balance – specifically, the relationship between variations in soil moisture and the difference between precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff. Our analysis reveals that satellite-based precipitation datasets generally show the highest consistency, while gauge-based datasets perform better in densely monitored regions of the Northern Hemisphere. For evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture, reanalysis datasets demonstrate broader areas of higher consistency compared to gauge- or satellite-based products. Spatial patterns of consistency are strongly influenced by aridity and temperature, which affect measurement and modelling accuracy, while vegetation cover further modulates the performance of soil moisture datasets. Notably, dataset consistency has improved significantly in northern mid-latitudes over recent decades, likely reflecting advancements in observational technologies and the effects of climate warming. These findings underscore the importance of continued efforts to enhance dataset coherence and reliability for robust hydrological assessments."

It offers a consistent view of coastal landforms, sediment types, and human modifications across nearly 10 million transects—covering one million kilometers of coastline. The dataset supports a wide range of applications, from coastal change monitoring and erosion risk assessment to climate adaptation planning, conservation, and coastal geology. 
 We present a globally consistent, high-resolution (100 m) coastal typology dataset derived from satellite imagery and elevation data using deep learning—the first application of its kind in coastal science. Using a supervised multi-task convolutional neural network, we classified nearly 10 million coastal transects (one million km of coast) into four coastal attributes along the cross-shore profile: (1) sediment type, (2) coastal type, (3) presence or absence of built environment, and (4) presence or absence of human-made coastal defenses. The model, trained on about 1800 globally distributed samples, achieves strong predictive performance with F1 scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.83. Results show that the global coastal sediment distribution consists of approximately 40 % sandy, gravel, or shingle; 21 % muddy; 13 % rocky; and 27 % with no sediment. Considering the coastal type, 33 % of coasts are cliffed, 22 % are sediment plains, 15 % are wetlands, and 3 % are dune systems (i.e. 26,000 km). Combining sandy, gravel, shingle, and muddy sediments, we estimate that 61 % of the global coastline consists of soft sediments that are potentially easily erodible. Among sandy, gravel, or shingle coasts specifically, 20 % are cliff-backed and 16.5 % are located on built-up coasts. This global dataset, available in a cloud-optimized format at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15599096, provides a robust foundation for coastal change analysis and erosion assessment, and enables new opportunities for broad-scale vulnerability mapping and adaptation planning in the face of accelerating sea-level rise."

This study compares a weather model (WRF) with real data across five North and Baltic Sea sites. Adjusting the model improved accuracy over the widely used ERA5. In key offshore regions, LLJs occur 10–15 % of the time and significantly boost wind power, especially in spring and summer, contributing up to 30 % of total capacity in some areas. 
 Low-level jets (LLJs), characterized by wind speed maxima in the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer, play a crucial role in shaping wind resource availability, particularly as modern wind turbines reach heights exceeding 200 m. Understanding the climatology of LLJs is essential for optimizing wind energy assessments in offshore environments. We leverage wind measurements from lidars and a mast at five sites in the North and Baltic seas to evaluate the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the widely used reanalysis ERA5 to characterize LLJs and use the optimal WRF setup to generate a detailed 5-year climatology. We test the sensitivity of LLJ representation to key WRF model configurations, including grid spacing, vertical resolution, surface layer (SL), and planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations.Results reveal that LLJ representation strongly depends on the PBL scheme, with LLJ frequency varying by more than a factor of 3 across configurations. For example, the Mellor–Yamada–Janjic (MYJ) scheme favored LLJ formation, while Yonsei University  (YSU), BouLac (BL), and Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–Niino (MYNN) 2.5 (with bl_mynn_mixlength=0) were less prone. The best-performing setup employed scale-aware subgrid mixing (km_opt=5; 3DTKE), accurately capturing LLJ occurrence rates, intensity, and vertical profiles. In contrast, ERA5 significantly underestimated LLJ frequency and failed to resolve key features, highlighting its limitations for detailed LLJ analysis.The 5-year LLJ climatology provides new insights into the spatial and seasonal distribution of LLJs, offering valuable guidance for offshore wind resource assessment and planning in the region. In the North and Baltic seas, LLJs occur along the western sea basins around 10 %–15 % of the time, with average jet heights between 140–220 m, which are well within the height of operation of modern wind turbines. The most LLJ-prone region is east of southern Sweden, especially during spring and summer, where LLJs contribute to up to 30 % of the wind capacity.

This study elucidates the dual-function role of pyrite in mediating the oxidative and reductive degradation of three model antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, SMX; norfloxacin, NOR; and chlortetracycline, CTC) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Systematic batch experiments coupled with reactive oxygen species analysis reveal a dual-function mechanism for pyrite involving oxidative degradation via •OH under aerobic conditions and reductive transformation under anaerobic conditions. Notably, sulfur species in pyrite serve as key electron donors, driving the defluorination and dechlorination reactions of NOR and CTC in the absence of molecular oxygen. X-ray absorption fine structure along with density functional theory simulations further demonstrate an S–Fe-antibiotic electron transfer pathway, wherein sulfide donates electrons via Fe(II) coordination sites. Field validation using natural estuary sediments corroborates the laboratory findings, highlighting the substantial contribution of pyrite-mediated reductive pathways to antibiotic attenuation. These findings advance the mechanistic insight into pyrite-driven redox processes in estuarine environments and underscore the overlooked role of sulfur species in mediating nonradical antibiotic degradation, with implications for natural attenuation and remediation strategies in sulfur-rich coastal systems."

This study examined the evolution of humic acid (HA, a representative of SOM) under simulated wildfire heating conditions (30–900 °C) in the presence of two representative soil minerals: montmorillonite (Mnt) and ferrihydrite (Fhy). Whereas Fhy accelerated the mineralization of HA, Mnt enhanced its preservation. These disparities stemmed from variations in the surface reactivity, structure, and transformations of Fhy and Mnt. Lewis acid sites, more abundant on Fhy surfaces than on Mnt surfaces, enhanced the decarboxylation of HA and caused carbon losses as CO2. However, Brønsted acid sites, which are more abundant on Mnt surfaces than on Fhy surfaces, enhanced carbon preservation by promoting HA isomerization and aromatization. Above 350 °C, lattice oxygen release from Fhy promoted the oxidative decomposition of HA, while Fhy itself underwent reduction to form magnetite, wüstite, and zero-valent iron. The confinement of HA within the micro/mesopores created by Mnt’s inert nanolayers prevented the thermal degradation of HA, enhancing carbon preservation. These findings advance our understanding of the specific roles of soil minerals in the decomposition, transformation, and preservation of SOM during wildfires."

Supply Potentials and Climate Effects of End-of-Life Electric Vehicle Batteries,"Recycling and reuse in stationary energy storage (second use) are beneficial options to further utilize electric vehicle (EV) battery materials and residual capacities after end-of-life (EoL). In California, EV sales shares have steadily increased recently, and state policies to achieve 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035 will further result in a rapidly growing number of EoL EV batteries. Based on modeling material flows and climate effects, in this study, EoL EV battery supply scenarios and the effect of recycling and second use on battery demand and saved greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are investigated on a regional level in California until 2050. The results indicate that stationary energy storage demands can be met by more than 100% by 2050 through the second use of EoL EV batteries. By contrast, recycling is expected to cover around 61% of the overall EV battery demand annually by 2050. Within system boundaries, the second use scenario, where EoL EV batteries are prioritized to be further used in stationary storage applications, shows potential cumulative GHG emission savings of about 55.8 MtCO2eq through the avoidance of battery production for stationary energy storage. Recycling of all EoL EV batteries results in GHG emission savings of about 48.3 MtCO2eq until 2050, driven by the replacement of primary raw materials in battery production. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis shows that adapting several model parameters, such as remanufacturing emissions, EV sales, battery lifetimes, and applied recycling processes, can have a substantial impact on the EoL EV battery supply and GHG emission savings by 2050."

However, they suffer from poor recyclability, disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation, and inefficient interfacial mass transfer. Therefore, we develop a gas–liquid–solid triphase photothermal catalysis (PTC)/chlorine system featuring a metal-free catalyst that regulates chlorine activation for superior EC removal and DBP control. This system achieves a high carbamazepine degradation rate constant of 0.38 min–1, which is 5.51 and 1.63 times that achieved by solar/chlorine and diphase systems. Moreover, PTC/chlorine can effectively degrade various ECs, including those lacking electron-donating groups, thus reducing their toxicity. This is attributed to the reduction of oxygen by photogenerated electrons to produce superoxide radicals, which regulate chlorine activation pathways to produce sufficient hydroxyl radicals for EC degradation while suppressing the generation of chlorine radicals, a major contributor to DBP formation. The PTC/chlorine system significantly suppresses DBP formation and DBP-associated toxicity by reducing chlorine exposure, promoting organic mineralization, and controlling pollutant degradation pathways. It is also highly practicable, as it remains largely unaffected by water matrices and possesses excellent reusability. The proposed triphase PTC/chlorine system thus represents an advanced, environmentally friendly, and sustainable chlorination process."

In particular, the polymerization is ineffective for recalcitrant phenolics and at low temperature, low initial concentration of phenolics, and high PDS dosage. The present contribution demonstrates that adding ferric chloride significantly enhances the removal efficiency, polymerization ratio, and PDS utilization efficiency, especially under the unfavorable conditions mentioned above. In the FeCl3-enhanced heat/PDS system, polymerization is promoted by iron-phenolic complexes, which favor the generation of more stable radical monomers through ligand to metal charge transfer. The ferrous ions thereby formed can accelerate PDS activation, thus synergistically contributing to polymerization. In comparison to the conventional mineralization-based advanced oxidation technologies, this process exhibits significantly higher oxidant utilization efficiency under a broad range of conditions, reducing PDS consumption by 85% when used for the treatment of real coking wastewater. Results highlight the great potentiality of this technology for the removal of phenolic pollutants and bring fundamental insights for low-carbon emission and sustainable remediation of industrial wastewater."

While wetland expansion─including protection, restoration, and construction, is widely promoted for sustainable water quality improvement, its effectiveness in mitigating antibiotic pollution remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a machine learning model based on a compiled data set of 337 experimental observations to quantify antibiotic removal and map risk distribution in wetlands across 2,833 counties/districts in mainland China. Between 2010 and 2020, the wetland area across China expanded by 34.7%, yet antibiotic removal improved by only 0.1%, failing to meaningfully reduce the risk. We find that antibiotic removal in wetlands is primarily constrained by input magnitudes rather than the wetland area. To address this, we proposed a multistage wetland management strategy to enhance antibiotic removal by 27.6% in 2020 and high-risk area reduction by 90.6% under  optimal policies by 2035. Furthermore, we further identified the importance of wetland management strategies through an interpretable model.

Despite existing efforts being invested to develop antiscalants to inhibit silicic acid polymerization, antiscalants that mitigate silica scaling during membrane desalination have been rarely reported in the literature. Further, key factors governing the performance of antiscalants remain unclear for silica scaling. In this study, we employed a combination of experimental and simulation approaches to investigate the role of molecular functionality in regulating the efficiency of the antiscalant to mitigate silica scaling in membrane distillation (MD). Five antiscalants, which share a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) backbone but possess different functional terminal groups or molecular structures, were tested and compared for their performance in hindering silicic acid polymerization and mitigating water vapor flux decline due to silica scaling in static experiments and dynamic MD desalination, respectively. Specifically, PEG-based antiscalants with an ether or amine terminal group significantly extended water recovery of MD from ∼40% to over 70% when a feedwater containing supersaturated silica with a saturation index of 0.37 was used. We demonstrated that structural variations in terminal functional groups regulated the molecular properties of PEG-based antiscalants and greatly altered their inhibition efficiency in MD, which contrasted with results from static experiments on silicic acid polymerization. Scanning electron microscopy and molecular simulations reveal that the efficiency of antiscalants is determined collectively by the morphology of the silica scale, the molecular conformation of antiscalants in aqueous solution, and the tendency of antiscalants to reach the membrane surface. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms and design principles of antiscalants tailored to controlling silica scaling in membrane desalination."

Comparative incubation experiments were conducted to investigate DOM/SOM degradation pathways, their contribution to NH4+-N enrichment, and effect of salinity on DOM/SOM degradation. Results showed that DOM and SOM degradation involved the progressive degradation of aliphatic compounds, highly unsaturated compounds (HUC), and polyphenols (PPE) with lower O/C to HUC and PPE with higher O/C.

Superhydrophilic membranes excel in resisting fouling during filtration, while superhydrophobic membranes are prized for their self-cleaning properties during maintenance. To address these contrasting needs, we herein propose a novel strategy by developing membranes with switchable superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity, enabling on-demand antifouling and self-cleaning. This membrane was created by electrodepositing copper oxides onto a copper mesh, resulting in the formation of hierarchical micro- and nanoscale structures. By applying a reduction voltage of –20 V, the copper oxides were converted into hydrophilic metallic copper, transforming the mesh into a superhydrophilic membrane. This transformation not only facilitated water permeation but also effectively repelled foulants during filtration. Remarkably, the gravity-driven permeation flux of the superhydrophilic membrane reached as high as 30,000 L·m–2·h–1. Furthermore, this superhydrophilic membrane demonstrated reasonable separation efficiency, achieving removal rates of 60.0% for total suspended solids, 93.1% for Melosira, and 83.0% for poly(vinyl alcohol). Upon heating at 100 °C for 1 h, the membrane surface reverted to a superhydrophobic state, enabling self-cleaning during membrane maintenance. With its facile preparation and smart electro- and thermo-responsive properties, this copper-based membrane, featuring reversibly switchable wettability, holds great promise for scalable applications in water treatment."

Compared to scenarios without VCPs emissions, VCPs emissions at levels comparable to traffic emissions lead to an approximately 60% increase in the concentration of O3 within the street canyon. The pedestrian-level pollutant concentration and health risk were evaluated, suggesting that more nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure was on the leeward side, while the levels of O3 exposure were higher on the windward side, with health risk increasing by 1.6–2.2 times with increased VCPs emissions or reduced traffic emissions. A total of 39 emission scenarios, varying in traffic and VCPs emission strengths, were analyzed to assess different mitigation strategies, including traffic-only, VCPs-only, and combined reduction pathways (i.e., adjusting the traffic-to-VCPs emission ratio, T/V). The results indicate that the concentration of O3 can be effectively reduced only when T/V = 1:5, suggesting that substantial reductions in VCPs emissions are necessary to mitigate pollution. This finding underscores the need for increased focus on VCPs controls, even in the context of vehicle electrification, as traffic reductions alone are insufficient to curb the level of O3 pollution.

Existing heat risk plans and responses often fail to account for the complex interdependencies among the various causes and impact pathways of heatwaves. Effective planning requires a system‐level understanding of these interdependencies to identify strategic entry points for action. This paper employs a participatory system mapping approach to explore the interconnections among causes, impacts, and response actions during the UK heatwave events of summer 2022. Cognitive maps were developed shortly after the events, incorporating input from 38 stakeholders across sectors involved in the heatwave response. These maps informed a forensic disaster analysis designed to provide a holistic understanding of the heatwave's causes, impacts, and adaptation measures. By analyzing the interdependencies among these factors, we identified cascading effects and amplifiers that significantly intensified heat risk in the UK. Notably, we find that the primary heatwave impacts were often indirect, emerging or worsening due to cascading effects such as wildfires, drought, transportation disruptions, and the overburdening of first responders. In many cases, adaptation measures were reactive, addressing isolated, short‐term impacts, while proactive, system‐level approaches tackling interconnected impacts and root causes, such as vulnerable buildings, at‐risk populations, and behavioral barriers, were largely absent. Additionally, we found notable variations in heat risk perceptions among groups. While individual sectors displayed a limited understanding of the broader heat risk system, a system‐level perspective emerged through the aggregation of cognitive maps.

The authors designed a microrobot with a single actuator, achieving high speed, agility, and resilience, even after being stepped on. 
 Cockroaches are renowned for their ability to swiftly navigate through tight spaces and robustly withstand high impacts due to their well-controlled locomotion and highly flexible exoskeletons. It has been a long-standing challenge to replicate these features in untethered controllable microrobots (weighing~1 g). Here, we show that a single actuator is used to tune a microrobot’s leg strokes for controllable movements in various directions (forward, backward, and diagonal). Weighing just over 1 g and measuring 2 cm in length, the untethered microrobot achieves a forward speed of 4.8 body lengths per second (BL/s) and a turning speed of 280 deg/s, resulting in an outstanding maneuverability that has only previously been achieved in multiply-actuated microrobots. The untethered microrobot can remain functional after being stepped on. The single actuator driving scheme, device structural architecture, and control techniques are investigated as key guidance for the development of future controllable and resilient miniaturized robots.

 Disulfide bond shuffling (DBS) critically influences protein aggregation and stability, yet its spatial constraints and biological implications remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that insulin undergoes DBS within an extended spatial range up to ~19 Å, generating heterogeneous crosslinked oligomers that alter aggregation pathway. While DBS products initially delay aggregation by inhibiting primary nucleation and elongation steps, they ultimately promote the formation of distinct fibrillar structures with enhanced β-sheet content. Native ion mobility-mass spectrometry reveals molecular crosstalk between DBS products and native insulin via both covalent and non-covalent interactions. Notably, DBS-modified insulin fibrils exhibit significantly increased neurotoxicity in neuronal and pancreatic cells through mitochondrial apoptosis activation as supported by proteomic and biophysical analysis. Our findings underscore the importance of controlling DBS in insulin for therapeutic applications and provide insights into the role of disulfide dynamics in protein aggregation and cytotoxicity, with implications for insulin and broader protein misfolding contexts.

 Starships form a recently discovered superfamily of giant transposons in Pezizomycotina fungi, implicated in mediating horizontal transfer of diverse cargo genes between fungal genomes. Their elusive nature has long obscured their significance, and their impact on genome evolution remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal a surprising abundance and diversity of Starships in the phytopathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae. Remarkably, Starships dominate the plastic genomic compartments involved in host colonization, carry multiple virulence-associated genes, and exhibit genetic and epigenetic characteristics associated with adaptive genome evolution. Phylogenetic analyses suggest extensive horizontal transfer of Starships between Verticillium species and, strikingly, from distantly related Fusarium fungi.

 Gasdermin E (GSDME) is known as a key executive protein of pro-inflammatory pyroptosis. However, the function diversity of GSDME needs further investigation. Here, we show that GSDME expression is downregulated in kidney tissues after cisplatin treatment without detectable N-terminal fragment. Global and tubule-specific Gsdme deficiency aggravates cisplatin-induced renal injury. Mechanistically, loss of GSDME in proximal tubular cells facilitates the recruitment of OGT to the CUL4B-DDB1-WDR26 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, promoting OGT degradation and subsequently reducing STAT3 O-GlcNAcylation. This post-translational shift enhances STAT3 phosphorylation and induces upregulation of its downstream target gene, S100a7a. Elevated S100A7A promotes macrophage infiltration via RAGE activation, amplifying renal inflammation. Tubule-specific depleting S100a7a improves renal function and reduces renal injury and inflammation. These findings uncover a protective, non-pyroptotic function of GSDME in modulating O-GlcNAcylation and STAT3-S100A7A-RAGE signaling to maintain renal homeostasis under cisplatin stress in male mice.

This study shows that DNMT1 regulates cortical development by orchestrating the migration of postmitotic SST+ interneurons and their signaling to cortical progenitors, with implications for proper cortical architecture and function. 
 The coordinated development of cortical circuits composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is critical for proper brain function, and disruptions are linked to a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. While excitatory neurons are generated locally in the cortical proliferative zones, inhibitory cortical interneurons (cINs) originate in the basal telencephalon and migrate tangentially into the cortex. Here, we show that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is essential for the migration and integration of somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons in mice. Dnmt1 deletion causes premature exit of SST+ cINs from the superficial migratory stream and alters the expression of key developmental genes. Unexpectedly, Dnmt1-deficient SST+ interneurons also exert non-cell-autonomous effects on cortical progenitor cells, resulting in subtle yet lasting alterations in cortical layering. These findings propose a role for DNMT1 in governing the migration of SST+ interneurons and mediating their instructive signaling to cortical progenitor cells, thereby shaping cortical architecture and influencing long-term network function.

 Identifying receptors for bat coronaviruses is critical for spillover risk assessment, countermeasure development, and pandemic preparedness. While Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) uses DPP4 for entry, the receptors of many MERS-related betacoronaviruses remain unknown. The bat merbecovirus HKU5 was previously shown to have an entry restriction in human cells. Using both pseudotyped and full-length virus, we show that HKU5 uses Pipistrellus abramus bat ACE2 but not human ACE2 or DPP4 as a receptor. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of the virus-receptor complex and structure-guided mutagenesis reveal a spike and ACE2 interaction that is distinct from other ACE2-using coronaviruses. MERS-CoV vaccine sera poorly neutralize HKU5 informing pan-merbecovirus vaccine design. Notably, HKU5 can also engage American mink and stoat ACE2, revealing mustelids as potential intermediate hosts.

Here we show the global distribution of the TC-SGWs based on 21 years of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder observations, and reveal three global hotspots of the waves as the North Atlantic-Northeast Pacific, the Northwest Pacific, and the South Pacific-Southern Indian region. We also characterize the local structure of the three hotspots and find that although displaying diverse anisotropic structures, they are all shaped by the combination of filtering and refraction effects of the background wind. Our findings provide a guide for global TC-SGW hotspots and demonstrate the contributions of the background wind, which can further provide a preliminary guide for TC monitoring through satellite observations of TC-SGWs."

 As global urbanization accelerates, its potential impact on compound temperature-humidity extremes has become a critical concern for sustainable urban development. Here we examine spatiotemporal trends and urbanization effects on dry-hot and wet-hot extremes during the warm season (May-September) across 136 Chinese cities from 1981 to 2022. Results show a significant increase in both compound extremes, with wet-hot days rising faster (1.5 days per decade) than dry-hot days (0.3 days per decade). Amplification indices reveal that wet-hot coupling dominates, accounting for 36% of all hot days, while dry-hot coupling is relatively rare (4%). However, the mounting dry-hot amplification index indicates that extreme heat is increasingly coupled with drought. Urbanization, driven by impervious surface expansion and vegetation loss, intensifies both extremes, especially during rapid urbanization phases.

 Snow algal blooms lead to glacier and snow surface albedo reduction and subsequent melting. To explore snow algal distribution patterns and potential to cause blooms, we investigated snow algae in the Tibetan, Antarctic, Arctic, and Alps. Our results demonstrated that Tibetan and Alps had higher algal richness than Antarctic snow. Only 19 ASVs were shared among regions, with their relative abundance being lower in the Tibetan compared to the Arctic and Alps but similar in Antarctica. Furthermore, the algal community varied substantially across sampling sites, with 34% of the identified taxa endemic to Tibetan glacier snow. Cosmopolitan bloom-causing algae were scarce in most Tibetan Plateau snow, which was potentially limited by a low snow depth that prevented their growth. Alternatively, Hydrurus sp., which may cause golden-brown snow, was abundant (up to 54.4%) on Tibetan. Therefore, cosmopolitan and endemic species jointly enhance the potential of producing algal blooms in Tibetan glaciers.

 Lakes provide many vital ecosystem services but are highly sensitive to human impacts and climate change. While data needed to assess their long-term trajectories are generally unavailable, lake responses to such perturbations can be inferred from sediment archives, including records of chlorophyll, a proxy for primary production. However, few if any datasets exist to test hypotheses at large spatial scales about the drivers of long-term change. Here, we apply rapid hyperspectral imaging to produce high-resolution records of sediment chlorophyll (defined as the sum of chlorophyll a and b and their degradation products) in dated cores from 80 lakes across Canada and identify an overall increase since the mid-19th-century. Breakpoint analysis detected a shift whereby the average rate of chlorophyll increase was seven times greater after 1966 than before. We then compared spatiotemporal chlorophyll trends to climate variables, solar irradiance, and land-use data to assess their relationships to past changes in primary production. We identified robust correlations between chlorophyll and climate variables (temperature and ice cover) that were especially strong after 1966, suggesting continental-scale alterations to lake primary production in response to recent accelerated warming. We also detected significant associations with incident solar radiation and catchment human impacts, and show that both had the potential to influence past primary production at the continental scale.

 Due to climatic and geographical factors, Africa suffers from severe water scarcity. Deep neural networks (DNNs) based remote sensing water segmentation models are helpful for the observation and effective use of water resources. However, African water segmentation task faces three major challenges: the lack of data, existence of many small water bodies and high similarity between water and background. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we first establish AWS16K, a water segmentation dataset covering the whole African area, and generate masks by a manual and automatic hybrid method. Second, we study the water and background information in the high-level features of DNNs, and demonstrate the cross-layer separability of these two types of information. Third, we design an asymmetric cross-layer input-dependent Feature Decoupling Transformer (FDTran), to extract water features from information mixed high-level features, improving water segmentation performance. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on AWS16K and two public image segmentation datasets, LandCover.ai and CrackVision12k, and our FDTran achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results compared to current semantic segmentation methods.

 The CE318-T sun–sky–moon photometer enables continuous diurnal and nocturnal observations of aerosol optical properties, addressing the long-standing global challenge of lacking detailed nighttime analysis and continuous day–night variation records of aerosol optical characteristics. This study, based on long-term aerosol optical property data from Beijing and continuous diurnal observation data from AERONET CE318-T, investigates the multi-time scale variation characteristics of aerosol optical properties in the urban area of Beijing, including long-term changes (2003–2023), and short-term (2018–2023) annual, seasonal, and diurnal variations. It focused on analyzing the continuous diurnal variation characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Ångström index (AE) and their underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrated a significant decreasing trend in aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD440) from 2003 to 2023, accompanied by a declining proportion of coarse particles. The increasing single-scattering albedo (SSA) indicated the slower downward trend of absorption. For the diurnal variation characteristics from 2018 to 2023, it was found that the hourly means in AOD440 generally exhibited lower levels during the day, with an upward trend, reaching a maximum value of 0.46 at 16:00. During nighttime, the AOD440 levels were higher than during the day but showed a downward trend, decreasing to a minimum value of 0.28 at 5:00. The diurnal variation of AOD440 presented obvious seasonal variation characteristics, continuously decreasing during daytime in summer and at night in autumn and winter. It was found that this variation pattern was related to meteorological conditions and local circulation. The differences in the diurnal variation patterns during the pollution and non-pollution periods were analyzed in combination with a severe pollution event."

 Atmospheric amines have gained significant attention for their role in new particle formation, nitrogen cycling, and climate change. To investigate their formation mechanisms and sources, year-round PM2.5 samples were collected in Xiamen, a coastal city in southeastern China. Samples were analyzed for methylamine (MA), ethylamine (EA), and dimethylamine (DMA) using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Total measured amine concentrations were higher in spring and winter than in summer and autumn, with an annual average of 24.9 ng m−3, dominated by MA (40.1 %). The dominant formation pathway of particle-phase amines varied seasonally. In summer and autumn, a strong correlation between amines and acidic ions highlighted the importance of acid-base chemistry in amine salt formation. Conversely, increased relative humidity (RH) and enhanced aerosol acidity in spring and winter favored direct dissolution. While atmospheric oxidation generally enhanced the gas-to-particle conversion of amines, evidence of amine degradation by oxidants was also observed in spring. Five sources of amines were identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF): biomass burning, secondary products, industrial emissions, coal combustion and agricultural emissions, and marine and dust emissions. During summer, autumn, and spring, secondary products were the primary contributors to amines, accounting for nearly or over half. However, in winter, combustion sources played a larger role. Although the dominant sources varied by season and episode during different high concentration episodes, combustion activities and secondary formation were generally identified as the major contributors. Backward trajectory analysis showed that pollutant transport from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions significantly influenced amine levels in Xiamen. The PRD region showed substantial contributions from biomass burning and secondary products, whereas the YRD region was mainly linked to industrial emissions as well as coal combustion and agricultural emissions. These findings improve understanding of amine processes, offering valuable insights for targeted emission control strategies."

 Wildland fires emit pollutants such as fine particulates (PM2.5), and ozone (O3) precursors that can adversely impact air quality. To better understand processes that directly influence smoke transport and plume chemistry, this study leveraged a coupled fire-atmosphere model (WRF-SFIRE-Chem) to quantify the contributions of wildfire smoke to O3 relative to regional anthropogenic emissions. Coupled fire-atmosphere-chemistry simulations were also used to examine how aerosol radiative feedbacks, i.e., smoke shading, modifies smoke transport and plume chemistry. This study investigated a major smoke episode that occurred during the record-breaking 2020 western U.S. wildfire season. Overall, WRF-SFIRE-Chem was able to reproduce the evolution of a regional smoke plume for the August 2020 smoke event. Sensitivity simulations from WRF-SFIRE-Chem show that O3 contributions from wildfire smoke (21 ± 4.4 ppb) were much larger than O3 enhancements from regional anthropogenic emission sources (11 ± 1.3 ppb). Smoke shading also had a large impact on meteorology where incoming solar radiation and 2-m temperature underneath the smoke plume decreased by ∼400 W m−2 and 4 °C, respectively. Smoke shading also altered smoke transport and reduced O3 concentrations within the smoke plume by up to 10 ppb. These results suggest that sizable enhancements in O3 can occur, even in the absence of regional anthropogenic emissions. This research also highlights the importance of accounting for smoke shading within chemical transport models, which proved to be important in the context of both smoke transport and plume photochemistry."

 Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are generated through the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and constitute a significant fraction of atmospheric particulate matter. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are primarily derived from anthropogenic sources, undergo oxidation processes that generate less volatile products. These products subsequently partition into aerosol particles, thereby contributing to SOA formation. This review synthesizes key findings from laboratory investigations regarding SOA formation from oxidation of PAHs, outlining the reaction products and mechanisms under diverse oxidation conditions, as well as the factors influencing SOA yields. Radical adduct formation and H-atom abstraction are pivotal in reactions involving hydroxyl (OH) radicals, nitrate (NO3) radicals, chlorine (Cl) atoms, and ozonolysis. SOA yields are notably affected by the conditions of photooxidation and the characteristics of the precursor compounds. Additionally, the review offers insights into the human effects and the mechanisms of cellular toxicity associated with SOA derived from naphthalene. Overall, this review elucidates the role of PAHs in SOA formation and provides critical information for the modulation of PAH-SOA to mitigate air pollution."

Indeed, energy models trained on one protein can predict functional cores and surfaces across more than a billion years of evolution, with only rare energetic couplings that we experimentally identify limiting the transplantation of cores between highly diverged proteins.

However, the identification of TCRs from patient material remains complex. We present a rapid de novo minibinder (miBd) design platform leveraging state-of-the-art generative models to engineer miBds targeting the cancer-associated peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) SLLMWITQC/HLA-A*02:01 (NY-ESO-1). Incorporating in silico cross-panning enabled computational prescreening of specificity, and molecular dynamics simulations allowed for improved predictability of in vitro success. We identified a high-affinity NY-ESO-1 binder and confirmed its structure using cryo–electron microscopy, which, when incorporated in a chimeric antigen receptor, induced killing of NY-ESO-1+melanoma cells. We further designed and validated binders to a neoantigen pMHC complex, RVTDESILSY/HLA-A*01:01, with unknown structure, demonstrating the potential for precision immunotherapy."

Here, we demonstrate atom-by-atom imaging of phasons, an ultrasoft class of moiré phonons in twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2). Using ultrahigh-resolution (<15 picometers) electron ptychography, we imaged the size and shape of each atom to extract time-averaged vibrational amplitudes as a function of twist angle and position. We observed several signature properties of moiré phasons, such as increased vibrational amplitudes at solitons and AA-stacked regions. By correlating experiments with molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations, we show that phasons dominate the thermal vibrations in low-angle twisted bilayers. These results represent a powerful route to image thermal vibrations at atomic resolution, unlocking experimental studies of a thus far hidden branch of moiré phonon physics."

In this study, we designed a de novo α-helical TCR mimic (TCRm) specific for the NY-ESO-1 peptide presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–A*02, achieving high on-target specificity with nanomolar affinity (dissociation constantKd= 9.5 nM). The structure of the TCRm-pMHC complex at 2.05-Å resolution revealed a rigid TCR-like docking mode with an unusual degree of focus on the up-facing NY-ESO-1 side chains, suggesting the potential for reduced off-target reactivity. Indeed, a structure-informed in silico screen of 14,363 HLA-A*02 peptides correctly predicted two off-target peptides, yet our TCRm maintained peptide selectivity and cytotoxicity as a T cell engager. These results represent a path for precision targeting of tumor antigens with peptide-focused α-helical TCR mimics."

We present a generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel effect using metasurfaces and graph theory, achieving controlled multiphoton bunching, antibunching, and entanglement across parallel Jones matrix–encoded spatial modes—all within a single-layer metasurface. A graph-theoretic dual framework is introduced that simultaneously encodes the metasurface-based multiport interferometer designs and its resulting nonclassical correlations, enabling the direct translation of linear quantum optical networks into a single-layer metasurface. We also demonstrate the ability of metasurfaces to produce multipath-entangled states and perform transformations equivalent to higher-order Hadamard interferometers. Our results underscore metasurface quantum graphs for scalable, low-decoherence quantum information infrastructure."

However, the recent discovery of a second pathogen causing leprosy,M. lepromatosis, mainly found in the Americas, challenges this view. Here, we show thatM. lepromatosisinfected humans in the Americas before European contact. By screening 389 ancient and 408 contemporary samples, we have expanded the genetic data available for the species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed distinct human-infecting clades ofM. lepromatosis, with one dominating North America since colonial times. The presence of millennia-old strains in North and South America indicates thatM. lepromatosismay have been widespread during the Late Holocene, demonstrating thatM. lepromatosisleprosy has a long-standing history in the Americas before European arrival."

We review how recent advances in molecular and multiomic methods, soil management, and crop diversification reduce negative and promote positive plant-soil feedback, emphasizing the need for rhizosphere microbiome engineering and soil restoration strategies. Applying nature-based plant-soil feedback principles would enhance transformation to more sustainable agricultural practices that secure food production by restoring natural soil functions, while simultaneously mitigating climate change."
