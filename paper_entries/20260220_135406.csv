As a result, several Earth system tipping elements could, at least temporarily, have their tipping points surpassed, posing risks of large-scale and profound structural change. Tipping does not always occur immediately upon crossing such a critical threshold. If the length of time the driver is beyond the critical level is short enough, tipping could still be avoided for some slow-responding elements of the climate system. An improved understanding is therefore needed of whether tipping remains avoidable, for which systems, and under what conditions. Here, we review how minimising the magnitude and duration of any temperature overshoot beyond 1.5 °C could decrease tipping risks. Tipping elements with fast response times, such as warm-water coral reefs, are especially vulnerable to overshoot. In contrast, those with slow response times, such as polar ice sheets, may be less sensitive to temporary overshoot. Potential interactions between tipping elements and additional human pressures, such as deforestation in the Amazon or pollution and overfishing of coral reef habitats, may further lower tipping points, narrowing the range of overshoot trajectories that can still avoid it. The vulnerability of many tipping elements, even under shorter overshoot conditions, underscores that global warming must peak below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, return to below 1.5 °C as quickly as possible (i.e. within this century), and to around 1 °C thereafter to limit tipping point risks."

To quantify this R–P relation, we define the CRE parameter, which exhibits significant disparities across global climate models (GCMs), with most overestimating it relative to the observation. Given the strong correlation between the CRE parameter and both historical and future extreme precipitation, an emergent constraint on the hydrological cycle projection is constructed. It lowers the fractional increase in the 99.9th percentile of tropical precipitation by the end of the 21st century from 29% to 24% under the high-emission warming scenario, with a 58% reduction in uncertainty. Overall, GCMs tend to underestimate the intensity of tropical extreme precipitation while overestimating its fractional increase. These findings provide valuable insights for model evaluation, improvement, and climate adaptation strategies."

Bardeen;Francis Vitt;Pengfei Yu,Uncertainties of SAI efficiency and impacts depending on the complexity of the aerosol microphysical model,"This study compares two sets of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) experiments using the same modeling framework, differing only in their aerosol microphysical schemes. Results show that these two schemes can yield substantially different aerosol burdens, radiative changes, and impacts when simulating the same injection scenarios. These findings suggest that more sophisticated aerosol models may be necessary to accurately assess the efficacy, side effects, and climate impacts of SAI. 
 Significant differences exist between Earth System Models in simulating the efficiency of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) experiments, particularly in terms of aerosol burden, radiative forcing, and impacts, such as tropical lower stratospheric heating and changes in ozone. However, the primary reasons for these differences have not been identified. Previous studies have proposed that these differences can be attributed to the use of different aerosol microphysical schemes, model resolution, or other physical parameterizations. Here, we compare two sets of SAI experiments using the same modeling framework of the Community Earth System Model, differing only in their aerosol microphysical schemes: the modal aerosol model (MAM4) and the sectional aerosol model (CARMA). We analyze scenarios varying in injection location (point vs. regional), amount (5 vs. 25 Tg S yr−1), and material (sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas vs. accumulation-mode sulfuric acid (AM-H2SO4) aerosol). Our results suggest that the SAI radiative efficiency may be substantially overestimated when using the modal aerosol model, particularly at higher injection rates, with implications for other impacts, including stratospheric ozone. While both sets of models confirm that AM-H2SO4 injections are more effective than SO2 injections in reducing net top-of-the-atmosphere radiative forcing, MAM4 yields significantly larger aerosol burdens and weaker size-dependent sedimentation, particularly at 25 Tg S yr−1. In contrast, CARMA produces a smaller aerosol burden, with more mass shifted into larger particles and a declining radiative efficiency at increased injection rates. These findings suggest that more sophisticated sectional models may be necessary to accurately assess the efficacy, side effects, and climate impacts of SAI."

We improved their representation in the EC-Earth model by introducing an aerosol-sensitive scheme for ice formation and a machine-learning approach for secondary ice production. These advances produce more realistic cloud properties and radiative effects, highlighting that both processes are essential for reliable climate projections. 
 Clouds and aerosol–cloud interactions remain major sources of uncertainty in climate projections. Here, we improve the representation of mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) in the EC-Earth3-AerChem Earth System Model by replacing the default temperature-dependent nucleation scheme with a physically based aerosol-sensitive heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterization. This scheme accounts for immersion freezing by K-feldspar, quartz, and marine organic aerosols, and is combined with a machine-learning-based parameterization of secondary ice production (SIP) to represent ice crystal multiplication processes.The new configuration improves agreement with global in situ ice nucleating particle (INP) observations and reveals realistic spatial patterns of ice crystal number concentrations (ICNC) across diverse environments. While these improvements do not eliminate the persistent structural cloud biases in EC-Earth3-AerChem, the aerosol-sensitive primary ice production scheme increases supercooled liquid water and cloud cover, particularly in the extratropics. Critically, the addition of SIP rebalances the cloud phase by enhancing ICNC in regions with low primary ice formation.Compared to the default scheme, the aerosol-sensitive primary ice production configuration with SIP reduces cloud radiative effect biases at mid- and high latitudes, while increasing them in the lower latitudes, leading to comparable global biases across configurations. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly representing both aerosol-sensitive nucleation and SIP for realistic simulations of MPCs and their radiative impacts. Unlike previous schemes, in which ice concentrations depend directly on INPs, the presence of effective SIP enhances ice formation in all MPCs and reduces the sensitivity of ICNC to aerosols, especially at low INP levels."

They benefit from regular, in-season adjustments – monthly recalibration proved most effective – to deliver reliable data. Using an uncommon recalibration method and state-of-the-art air sensor test protocols for evaluation, we showed the importance of recurrent calibration to maximize sensor performance and to broaden their scope of application, particularly for ozone monitoring. 
 The appropriate period of collocation of a low-cost air sensor (LCS) with reference measurements is often unknown. Previous LCS studies have shown that due to sensor ageing and seasonality of environmental interferences periodical sensor calibration needs to be performed to guarantee sufficient data quality. While the limitations are well-established it is still unclear how often a recalibration of a sensor needs to be carried out. In this study, we demonstrate how widely used air sensors (OX-B431 and SPS30) for the relevant air pollutants ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by two manufacturers (Alphasense and Sensirion) should be recalibrated for real-world monitoring applications. Sensor calibration functions were built using Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. We use multiple novel test protocols for air sensors provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the European Committee for Standardization for evaluative guidance and to identify possible applications for OX-B431 and SPS30 sensors. We conducted a yearlong collocation campaign at an urban background air and climate monitoring station next to the University Hospital Augsburg, Germany. LCSs were exposed to a wide range of environmental conditions, with air temperatures between −10 and 36 °C, relative air humidity between 19 % and 96 % and air pressure between 937 and 983 hPa. The ambient concentration ranges for O3 and PM2.5 were up to 82 ppb and 153 µg m−3, respectively. For the baseline single training of 5 months, the calibrated O3 and PM2.5 sensors were able to reflect the hourly reference data well during the training (R2: O3 = 0.92–1.00; PM2.5 = 0.93–0.97) and the following test period (R2: O3 = 0.93–0.98; PM2.5 = 0.84–0.93). Additionally, the sensor errors were generally acceptable during the training (RMSE: O3 = 0.80–4.35 ppb; PM2.5 = 1.45–2.51 µg m−3) and the following test period (RMSE: O3 = 3.62–5.84 ppb; PM2.5 = 2.04–3.02 µg m−3). We investigated different recalibration cycles using a pairwise calibration strategy, which is an uncommon method for recurrent LCS calibration. Our results indicate that a regular in-season recalibration is required to obtain the highest quantitative validity and broadest range of applications (indicative and non-regulatory supplemental measurements) for the analysed LCSs. Monthly recalibrations are observed to be the most suitable approach. The measurement uncertainties of the calibrated O3 LCSs and PM2.5 LCSs were able to meet the data quality objective for indicative measurements for different calibration models. In-season recalibration, rather than reliance on a single pre-deployment calibration, should be adopted by end-user communities. This approach is required for certain real-world applications to be performed reliably by LCSs and to achieve sufficient information content."

A systematic −20 % bias in Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy compared to direct-sun ultraviolet and infrared data is linked to limited sensitivity above a few kilometers and simplified vertical profiles assumptions. Using model-based priors and accounting for vertical sensitivity removes these differences, improving consistency for satellite validation. 
 MAX-DOAS (Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy), direct sun DOAS (DS) and FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed) measurements are considered nowadays as reference data for the validation of HCHO satellite observations. Recognizing their strengths and limitations, as well as evaluating their consistency, is crucial for generating robust and reliable validation datasets. So far, only a handful of studies have explored the complementarity between MAX-DOAS and direct sun FTIR HCHO measurements and the question of the consistency of the ground-based retrievals within the different networks currently used for satellite validation is still relevant. Here we take advantage of the presence of a MAX-DOAS spectrometer, incorporating a direct sun viewing mode capability, and an FTIR instrument operating in parallel at the Xianghe site (39.75° N, 116.96° E, China), to compare the retrieved HCHO vertical columns and investigate the reasons for the observed differences. First, we compare the UV and IR HCHO vertical column densities (VCDs) in the direct sun geometry, for which the uncertainty due to the light path is negligible. We find an excellent agreement between the measurements obtained in both wavelength ranges, with a median difference of less than −0.5 × 1015 molec. cm−2 (−6 % ± 11 % for (FTIR − DS) / DS). Second, the MAX-DOAS data from different retrieval strategies implemented within the European Space Agency Fiducial Reference Measurement centralized processing facility for DOAS observations are compared to the DS and FTIR ones. The MAX-DOAS HCHO columns correlate well with the direct sun DOAS and FTIR data, but underestimate them by about 20 %. Focusing on the vertical profiles, we show that this bias cancels out when taking properly into account the different a priori profiles and the respective vertical sensitivities of the MAX-DOAS and FTIR measurements. The underestimation in the current MAX-DOAS VCDs is coming from the limited vertical sensitivity of the technique and from the choice of the a priori profile, which neglects the free-tropospheric contribution (above 4 km), where the MAX-DOAS has no sensitivity. We test and suggest possible improvements to the current centralized MAX-DOAS HCHO retrievals processing, like  using more appropriate a priori profiles, based on the CAMS and TM5 chemical-transport models (CTMs) that better estimate the HCHO content above 4 km."

We see a ground projection of these methane plumes from the satellites that, similarly to clouds or buildings, are distorted depending on the observation and illumination angle. Here we highlight this issue and propose a methodology to account for it using simulations that could enhance current and upcoming retrieval and quantification algorithms. 
 A growing constellation of methane-sensitive instruments from space is making it possible to monitor methane point-source emissions from different industries and activities. Advanced plume simulation methods are becoming key to better understanding the uncertainties in the plume detection and quantification processes. This paper describes how observation and illumination angular configuration affects satellite-derived methane enhancement fields and, more critically, the calibration and uncertainty of semi-empirical emission rate estimation models, using simulated datasets. We review the mathematical expression of the retrieval and quantification methodologies to determine the uncertainty sources. We implement a method to simulate the apparent displacement of the plume when projected on the ground due to tilted illumination and observation (i.e., parallax effect). We apply this method to methane plumes generated from 3D spatial distributions of methane using the Weather and Research Forecasting Model in large-eddy simulation mode (WRF-LES). The results in the methane enhancement (ΔXCH4) maps show large spatial variations of the plumes with respect to a reference case with nadir observation and zenith illumination. In short, it suggests that the spatial distribution of the plumes is largely determined not only by the turbulence in the atmosphere but also by the acquisition's illumination and observation geometry. We tested the impact in the methane flux rate using the integrated mass enhancement (IME) method. Assuming nadir observation, these errors have a polar dependence with the solar angles that for our training dataset at 20 × 20 m2 reaches values as high as the 30 % error for high sun zenith angles orthogonal to the direction of the plume. The errors in the IME method are explained by the changing plume area with angular projection on the ground. Furthermore, it also has an impact on the probability of plume detection (PoD). The PoD is significantly reduced in the orthogonal plane to the wind direction and increases in opposite directions to the wind where the plumes are compressed. The dependence of the PoD on the angles increases with high values of U10 with differences of up to 4 times between angular configurations at high sun zenith angles. Our results illustrate the importance of considering acquisition and observation geometry when analysing plume maps with a spatial sampling of 20 m or better."

Zerefos,PV power modelling using solar radiation from ground-based measurements and CAMS: Assessing the diffuse component related uncertainties leveraging the Global Solar Energy Estimator (GSEE),"We perform Photovoltaic (PV) power simulations with the Global Solar Energy Estimator and assess the uncertainty linked to the use of a diffuse fraction model. Validation is conducted under diverse atmospheric conditions, including cloudiness and aerosols, using input data from ground-based measurements and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Results indicate that simulations are reliable under most conditions, with overestimations occurring during intense dust events. 
 Accurate PV power production modelling requires precise knowledge of the distribution of solar irradiance among its direct and diffuse components. Since this information is rarely available, this requirement can be addressed through the use of diffuse fraction models. In this study, we try to quantify the errors in PV modelling when measurements of the diffuse solar irradiance are not available. For this purpose, we use total and diffuse solar irradiance data obtained from ground-based measurements of BSRN to simulate the PV electric output using GSEE. We have chosen five sites in Europe and North Africa, with different prevailing conditions, where BSRN measurements are available. GSEE incorporates an implementation of the Boland-Ridley-Lauret (BRL) diffuse fraction model, along with a Climate Data Interface that enables simulations across different time scales. We evaluate the capability of BRL in providing accurate estimations of the diffuse fraction under diverse atmospheric conditions, with particular attention on the presence of clouds and aerosols and assess the extent to which its associated errors propagate to energy production modelling. Furthermore, we compare GSEE outputs when using CAMS radiation time-series as input instead of ground-based measurements, to quantify the impact of the CAMS radiation product uncertainties in PV modelling."

We show the first evaluation of Greenland clouds in the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2.4) with new EarthCARE satellite data. Comparing lidar and radar observations and retrieved cloud profiles with co-located RACMO output, we find RACMO captures low ice clouds but underestimates high clouds, mid-altitude liquid clouds, and snowfall. These results highlight EarthCARE's potential to improve polar climate models. 
 Clouds present one of the major challenges for polar climate modeling and significantly contribute to uncertainties in climate and ice sheet mass balance projections, as their radiative effect can strongly impact ice and snow melt. Therefore, a reliable representation of clouds in polar climate models is essential, yet the observations necessary for their evaluation remain sparse. The launch of the Earth Cloud, Aerosol, and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite in May 2024 helps bridge this gap by offering cloud observations in unprecedented detail using multiple instruments. Here, we demonstrate the potential of using these novel observations to evaluate cloud representation over the Greenland ice sheet in the regional climate model RACMO (version 2.4p1). To this end, we show along-track comparisons of co-located RACMO cloud profiles with EarthCARE lidar and radar observations. We compare both lidar backscatter and radar reflectivity observations, as well as retrieved cloud properties, with simulated RACMO profiles for two selected case studies. These first results indicate that RACMO simulates low- and mid-altitude ice clouds and snowfall at the correct locations, but fails to capture thinner high-altitude clouds. Additionally, RACMO typically underestimates cloud ice and snow water content, in particular in precipitating systems, where RACMO underestimates snowfall rates. Regarding supercooled liquid and mixed-phase clouds, RACMO does not always reproduce these, especially when they are located at higher altitudes. These first comparisons highlight the potential for using EarthCARE observations to evaluate regional climate models and provide directions for further development of RACMO."

It was collected over a period of 3.5 years and facilitated by a camera-based approach. This open-access resource assists scientists in evaluating and refining existing models, improving process understanding, and training artificial intelligence. 
 Although process-based soil erosion models are valuable tools for predicting and managing soil erosion, their limitations arise from constraints in integrating novel data possibilities, uncertainties in parameterisation, and the difficulties in integrating different process scales and their transitions. This study presents a unpresented approach to enhance soil erosion modelling through the utilisation of nested high-resolution spatio-temporal data obtained through structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry. This technique permits comprehensive observation of soil surface elevation changes during precipitation events, encompassing data acquisition at diverse scales, from plot to slope to micro-catchment. The study presents a unique dataset (Epple et al., 2026, https://doi.org/10.25532/OPARA-1038)  that integrates high-resolution time-lapse photogrammetry, field measurements, and UAV (uncrewed aerial vehicle) photogrammetric data, collected over nearly four years. This dataset is intended to enhance the understanding of soil erosion processes and serve as a valuable resource for model evaluation and calibration. The authors encourage the broader scientific community to utilise and expand this dataset, which is expected to contribute to the development of more accurate soil erosion models, thereby improving predictions and management strategies."

The dataset provides water quality parameters for lakes, rivers, coastal waters, as well as the entire North Sea and Baltic Sea. It further includes a novel estimate of organic carbon across diverse water bodies and the results of an optical water type classification. The dataset and its underlying algorithm provide a valuable foundation for future oceanographic and limnological analyses. 
 Despite advances in remote sensing, consistent monitoring of water quality across freshwater-marine systems remains challenging due to methodological fragmentation. Here, we provide an overview of an exemplary dataset on water quality characteristics in inland waters, coasts, and the open sea estimated from optical satellite data (https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/AquaINFRA_Sentinel3_v2, Hieronymi et al., 2025). Specifically, this is Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) data for the entire North Sea and Baltic Sea region for the period June to September 2023. The dataset includes daily aggregated observational data with a spatial resolution of approximately 300 m of reflectance at the top-of-atmosphere and for cloud-free water areas remote-sensing reflectance, inherent optical properties of the water, and an estimation of the concentrations of water constituents, e.g. related to the aquatic carbon content. These are the results of the novel A4O atmospheric correction and the ONNS water algorithm. The dataset serves as a prototype for understanding the processing chain and interdependencies, but also for developing a high degree of connectivity for answering various scientific questions; we do not perform an actual validation of the 73 individual parameters in the dataset. The challenges of a validation covering all water types are illustrated using one parameter, the particulate organic carbon concentration in water. The aim of this work is to show how fragmentation in water quality monitoring along the aquatic continuum from lakes, rivers to the sea can be overcome by applying an optical water type-specific and neural network-based processing scheme for Copernicus satellite data. Emphasis of this work is on analysing the optical complexity of remote-sensing reflectance in the North Sea, Baltic Sea, coastal, and inland waters. Results of a new optical water type classification show that almost all (99.7 %) remote-sensing reflectance spectra delivered by A4O are classifiable and that, based on this data, the region exhibits the full range of optical diversity of natural water bodies. The dataset can serve as a blueprint for a holistic view of the aquatic environment and is a step towards an observation-based digital twin component of the complex system."

Here we present the Global Forest Cover map of year 2020, derived from the combination of most recent publicly available land cover and land use datasets. The map is a globally-consistent representation of the presence/absence of forests based on EUDR definitions, but its use is not mandatory, not exclusive and not legally binding. 
 Remote sensing-based observations are used to map tree cover extent, estimate canopy height, detect disturbances, and classify land cover and land use. However, comprehensive global information on forest cover, capturing both physical characteristics and land use components as defined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), remains limited. Here, we present a harmonized and globally consistent map of forest presence or absence at 10 m spatial resolution for the year 2020, hereafter referred to as GFC2020. Our approach combines multiple spatial datasets, primarily derived from Earth observation (EO), to harness their complementary strengths within a transparent, flexible, and open science framework. GFC2020 maps 4562 million hectares (Mha) of forests globally, which is 9.5 % more than the estimate from latest FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) for 2020. GFC2020 forest area does not include 578 Mha of tree cover (11 % of the global tree cover area) because these areas do not meet the height threshold or occur on agricultural or urban land. Conversely, around 0.6 % (∼ 25 Mha) of the area classified as forest in GFC2020 is unstocked, due to forest management practices or natural disturbances such as fire. Based on the reinterpretation of a previously collected reference set of 21 752 sample units, GFC2020 achieves an overall accuracy of 91 %, with a commission error of 18 % and an omission error of 8 % for forest. Improvements in EO products, such as better detection of trees in dry and open landscapes, distinguishing natural from human drivers of forest disturbance, mapping tree crops at high spatial resolution or identifying agroforestry systems, will contribute to enhancing future versions of GFC2020. The shift from tree cover to forest cover mapping is not only essential for ecological and climate-related applications but also provides new opportunities to support policy needs. GFC2020 is one of many tools to inform the deforestation risk assessments under supply chain oriented regulations such as the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).

Using artificial intelligence, we mapped global atmospheric ice. This continuous record fills critical gaps in observation. It provides scientists with a vital tool to improve weather forecasts and better understand how atmospheric ice interacts with the global climate system. 
 This study introduces FYAI, a global, long-term atmospheric ice water path (IWP) and suspended ice water path (SIWP) dataset spanning 2010–2024, derived from passive microwave observations (MWHS-I/II) onboard China's Fengyun-3 series satellites. The dataset is generated using a machine learning framework featuring a lightweight multilayer perceptron architecture enhanced with gated residual units. This design robustly handles the inherent uncertainties in satellite brightness temperatures and the spatial mismatch between passive microwave footprints and active radar/lidar training data. By establishing rigorous spatiotemporal collocation with CloudSat 2C-ICE products, FYAI provides two operational product levels adhering to standard Earth observation data processing definitions: (1) Level-2 (L2) products, offering instantaneous orbital-resolution IWP and SIWP at a nominal 15 km nadir resolution for 2010–2024; and (2) Level-3 (L3) products, comprising monthly global gridded composites at 1°×1° resolution (2010–2024). FYAI bridges the gap between instantaneous pixel-level precision and broad spatiotemporal coverage, offering a comprehensive, decadal-scale record of global atmospheric ice content. This dataset, specifically designed to support long-term climate analysis and model validation, is openly available in netCDF4 format for community use (https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.303143, Yang et al., 2025)"

 Reliable calibration data are essential for ensuring the accuracy and traceability of precipitation measurements obtained from tipping-bucket rain gauges (TBRGs), which are widely used in hydrological and meteorological monitoring networks. Although manual burette-based calibration remains the most commonly applied approach, its reproducibility is often limited by operator dependency and changes in discharge conditions during experiments.

Using careful quality checks and two new methods, we improved the accuracy of these atmospheric profiles. The dataset reveals a gentle warming close to the surface and frequent wintertime temperature inversions, which rise during heavy pollution. These findings help improve weather, climate, and air-quality studies. 
 Ground-based microwave radiometers (MWRs) are indispensable instruments for the continuous observation of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. The reliability of brightness temperature (TB) measurements and the accuracy of retrieved atmospheric profiles are fundamental to their effective use in both research and operational applications. In this study, we present a long-term dataset of multi-channel microwave brightness temperature observations and corresponding retrieved atmospheric profiles derived from the RPG-HATPRO MWR deployed at the Xianghe Integrated Observatory (XH) in Hebei Province, China, covering the period 2013–2022. Minute-level TB observations over the 10-year period were integrated with collocated infrared cloud detection data to establish a comprehensive dataset featuring a detailed weather-type classification. The quality of the observed TBs was carefully evaluated using a radiative transfer model. The results demonstrate excellent agreement between simulated and observed multi-channel TBs, with correlation coefficients typically exceeding 0.96 and mean biases within 1 K, confirming the stable and reliable performance of the XH MWR throughout the entire observation period. Based on the quality-controlled TBs, two retrieval schemes for atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles were developed using collocated radiosonde observations and ERA5 reanalysis data. For clear-sky conditions, an optimal estimation (OE)-based retrieval model was employed, whereas a deep neural network (DNN)-based model was designed for cloudy-sky retrievals. Validation against radiosonde measurements shows that both retrieval schemes achieved substantially improved accuracy up to 35 % for temperature and 25 % for humidity profiles by compared with the MWR’s self-developed products. Combining the two retrieval models with the 10-year quality-controlled TB dataset, we constructed a comprehensive data record characterized by decadal-scale, high temporal resolution (1~10 min), and integrated MWR observations and profiles dataset. Based on the long-term dataset, it reveals a weak but consistent near-surface warming trend across 100–1000 m. They also capture the frequent surface-based inversions, occurred from 6 % in summer to 68 % in winter. Critically, SBI occurrence increases with PM2.5 levels, reaching >60 % under severe pollution (>250 µg m⁻³). Those applications demonstrate the dataset’s value for boundary layer studies, climate trend analysis, and air quality forecasting."

It fills a critical data gap, enabling detailed spatiotemporal analysis of these events. This validated resource provides a solid foundation for investigating stratosphere-troposphere transport and its impacts on near-surface air quality and extreme weather. 
 Tropopause folds are a primary mechanism for stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT), significantly influencing tropospheric ozone, air quality, and regional weather. However, a multi-year, high-resolution folding dataset for China has been lacking. To address this gap, we developed a comprehensive tropopause folding dataset for China and its surrounding regions using the ERA5 reanalysis data and a three-dimensional labeling method for the period 2014–2023. This dataset is distinguished by its decade-long coverage (2014–2023) and an unprecedented combination of high spatial (0.25°×0.25°) and temporal (hourly) resolutions across 37 vertical levels, which collectively facilitate a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal characteristics of folds in these regions. We validated the dataset's accuracy and its capability to capture the full evolution of folding events by comparing it with global datasets and multiple case studies of stratospheric intrusions. The high-resolution dataset not only aligns with large-scale climatology from previous studies but also resolves finer details that were previously smoothed out. Furthermore, this dataset reveals the distinct spatiotemporal distribution of tropopause folds over China. Folding events over China were found to occur predominantly in winter and spring, with significantly lower frequencies in summer and autumn. Spatially, shallow folds are concentrated along the subtropical jet stream, while medium folds peak over the Tibetan Plateau and Sichuan Basin in winter. Deep folds, though less frequent, have a notable impact on southwestern China, including the Tibetan Plateau, where they can substantially affect surface ozone levels. This dataset provides a solid foundation for in-depth investigations of STT mechanisms and the subsequent impacts of tropopause folds on near-surface atmospheric composition and extreme weather events, thereby serving as a valuable resource for the atmospheric science community."

However, comparisons between species are complicated by varying testing conditions, which can limit the application to derivation of environmental quality guidelines. Furthermore, few studies have reported 6PPDQ tissue concentrations in fish with known exposure concentrations. Using standard methods with flow-through exposures to provide stable 6PPDQ concentrations, we compared time courses of mortality in three sensitive salmonid species (coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss), evaluated the potential for latent (delayed) mortality, and measured tissue concentrations in both fish that died during exposure and those that survived an additional 7 days in clean water. Further experiments documented insensitivity in two centrarchids (smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu and largemouth bass Micropterus nigricans). Our study provided evidence for two mortality time courses: one in which nearly all mortality occurs in the first 24 h and one in which mortalities continue to accumulate throughout the exposure, and 96-h and 24-h LC50s are quite different. We did not observe evidence for the delayed onset of mortality due to 6PPDQ exposure. Most fish that survived exposure had undetectable 6PPDQ concentrations after 1 week in clean water, potentially informing biomonitoring strategies for wild populations."

However, the metabolic transformation of soot particles, a key link between soot exposure and health outcomes, remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a novel bottom-up method to rapidly synthesize 13C-labeled soot, enabling in vivo tracking of soot metabolism by mass spectrometry. In vitro metabolic experiments utilizing human liver postmitochondrial liver supernatant (S9) fractions show the potential involvement of soot in human endogenous metabolism. Using animal exposure models combined with nontargeted metabolic flux analysis, we further demonstrate that soot particles can be utilized as a carbon source by the organism and directly integrated into biological metabolic processes, subsequently affecting metabolites and potential pathways associated with diseases. Our findings suggest that no clear-cut boundary exists between exogenous inert soot particles and endogenous metabolites, offering novel insights into the “black box” of internal exposure of air pollution and their associated pathogenic mechanisms."

However, their response mechanisms to environmental heterogeneity remain unclear, as traditional experiments or models typically overlook the complexity of cross-kingdom microbial networks. To address this, we established a cross-scale framework that integrates controlled mesocosm experiments with field lake surveys across trophic gradients. Using multilevel network analysis, we found that increased environmental heterogeneity promoted stochastic assembly and niche differentiation within phyllosphere communities. This enhanced the functional metabolic complementarity of algal–bacterial networks, thereby strengthening the ecosystem resilience. These findings challenge the traditional view that homogeneous environments favor microbial functional redundancy. Notably, machine learning models trained on experimental data showed high predictive accuracy but exhibited systematic biases when applied to natural lakes, highlighting the scale-dependent complexity of in situ microbial networks. Our study identifies heterogeneity-driven microbial insurance as a critical stabilizing mechanism and advocates for incorporating this ecological complexity into cross-scale restoration strategies."

The triboelectric effect, a ubiquitous phenomenon resulting from interfacial charge transfer during contact-separation of materials, is hypothesized to efficiently convert mechanical energy into electricity. Here, we demonstrate that liquid–solid friction can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, thereby supporting autotrophic microbial growth and metabolism without relying on conventional sunlight or chemical energy inputs. Using electroactive Rhodopseudomonas palustris and dielectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as a model biohybrid system, we found that mechanical vibration primarily induces triboelectric charge transfer at the water-PVDF interface, leading to free electron accumulation on the PVDF surface. These electrons are subsequently taken up by R. palustris for carbon fixation and denitrification, resulting in an increase in biomass from ca. 2.79 ± 0.25 to 6.27 ± 0.31 mg of protein/L over 30 days. This phenomenon was further observed across various dielectric materials and electroactive bacterial strains, suggesting a potentially universal mechanical-force-driven process for microbial communities. Our findings reveal a novel role of mechanical force via the triboelectric effect as an energy source for driving microbial growth and metabolism, which enhances our understanding of the interactions between mechanical forces and biological systems."

However, their relative contributions to shaping the antibiotic resistome in treatment systems remain unclear. In this study, we simulated an aerobic activated sludge process treating livestock wastewater containing enrofloxacin and heavy metals (Cu2+ and Zn2+) to evaluate the development of antibiotic resistance using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. We observed a diverse and transcriptionally active resistome with over half of the detected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) showing expression. ARG profiles under coexposure to enrofloxacin and heavy metals more closely resembled those under heavy metal exposure alone than those under enrofloxacin exposure alone. Zn2+ exposure resulted in the highest absolute ARG abundance, nearly double that of the control group. Both enrofloxacin and heavy metals significantly altered the abundance and phylogenetic composition of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). The exposure to Zn2+ enhanced the relative abundance and expression level of both metal resistance genes (MRGs)-carrying ARB and the ARGs-carrying plasmids. Phylogenetic analysis of ARG flanking sequences revealed high homology across various genetic contexts. Among mobile genetic elements, plasmids had a greater influence on ARG profiles than did phages or integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Transcriptional profiles of microbial physiological adaptations suggested that modulation of cell membrane permeability, promotion of conjugative transfer, and formation of biofilm might play roles in enhancing antibiotic resistance. These findings suggest at environmentally relevant concentrations, heavy metals such as Zn2+ may present a stronger selective pressure than enrofloxacin for the propagation of antibiotic resistance in aerobic activated sludge process treating livestock wastewater."

However, their physicochemical diversity complicates the prediction of environmental fate and toxicity. To elucidate the main drivers of their toxicity in aquatic organisms, we investigated ten structurally diverse monomeric acrylamides and methacrylamides in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) (ZFE). Acute toxicity varied over 2 orders of magnitude (0.16–33 mM) and showed a moderate correlation with hydrophobicity (logKlipw, R2 = 0.87) and intrinsic electrophilic reactivity (logkGSH). Measured bioconcentration factors of highly polar, reactive compounds (e.g., NMBA) for ZFE deviated up to 16-fold from model predictions, indicating limited uptake or significant biotransformation. This indicates an impact of toxicokinetics on their in vivo toxicity. UPLC-HRMS-based nontarget screening revealed 90 transformation products across the ten compounds. Glutathione conjugation and mercapturic acid formation were dominant pathways, with mercapturic acid-taurine conjugates observed for eight compounds, suggesting a previously undescribed detoxification mechanism for (meth)acrylamides in the ZFE. Our results highlight the need to integrate toxicokinetic data into hazard assessment of electrophilic compounds, as in vitro assays may overestimate risks. The ZFE provides a mechanistically informative in vivo model to reduce misclassifications, especially for polar and reactive chemicals."

Here we show that SO2 autoxidation is largely accelerated by surface-active organic acids such as dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) in deliquesced organic aerosol particles. Specifically, the sulfate formation rate in DCA particles (i.e., glutaric, succinic, and malonic acids) is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than in inorganic particles under identical buffered pH and ionic strength conditions, and is 4–5 orders of magnitude higher than in solutions. We find that the reaction rate is proportional to the surface-to-volume ratio (1/R) of individual deliquesced aerosols by TEM-EDS, suggesting that the aerosol surface is involved. Combining experimental results with theoretical simulations, we reveal that the enrichment of DCAs at the air–water interface of aerosols enhances SO2 autoxidation by promoting the surface uptake of SO2 and accelerating the oxidation of HSO3– by O2 within a distinct subsurface region. These findings suggest that the subsurface of aerosols may serve as a previously unrecognized hotspot for multiphase oxidation of SO2, and that organic-acid-accelerated SO2 autoxidation can occur at rates comparable to the H2O2 oxidation pathway."

Here, we report that Mn minerals exhibit unexpectedly high photochemical reactivity for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Through systematic evaluation of five representative Mn minerals (pyrolusite, psilomelane, rhodochrosite, hausmannite, and vernadite), we revealed •OH production rates reaching 16.2–168.6 μM over 120 min sunlight irradiation. Both valence band (VB) water oxidation and conduction band (CB) oxygen reduction contributed to ROS productions, with relative contributions varying among minerals. Remarkably, ROS yields from Mn minerals exceed those from Fe minerals by more than an order of magnitude; for instance, vernadite exhibited a steady-state •OH concentration of 4.9 × 10–16 M, compared to 9.5 × 10–18 M for hematite. Higher ROS production correlated with greater charge separation efficiency, as indicated by high photocurrent densities (e.g., 2.5 × 10–6 A cm–2 for vernadite) and substantial photoinduced surface potential shifts (e.g., +150 mV for vernadite). The •OH generated by Mn minerals oxidized aromatic-rich natural organic matter (NOM) into more labile forms and reshapes the microbial community composition. These results indicate that Mn minerals are an important and previously underappreciated source of ROS in sunlit environments, with implications on oxidative processes at mineral–water interfaces and their role in global biogeochemical cycles."

Herein, we investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of perchlorate contamination in China’s largest fireworks production regions, observing a significant ″accumulation corridor″ aligning with the industrial clustering zones. We developed a knowledge-guided framework, integrating process-based hydrology with deep learning, to predict perchlorate concentration dynamics at the basin scale. The model outperforms traditional data-driven approaches in capturing long-term trends and episodic peaks while leveraging Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) gates to distinguish point versus nonpoint sources. We demonstrate that industrial point sources contribute ∼65% of total corridor loads, whereas nonpoint loads are seasonally amplified, with rainy-season fluxes 1.7–2.8× higher than dry seasons. Attention analysis identifies that average fireworks factory density, precipitation, and soil properties are dominant drivers for nonpoint perchlorate sources. Furthermore, multiscenario simulations indicate that coordinated controls on point, nonpoint, and upstream boundary inputs substantially reduce exceedance frequency within the simulated ensembles. This work provides a transferable framework that converts fragmented observations into basin-scale diagnosis and scenario-based decision support for industrial contaminant risks, contingent on local monitoring, industrial structure information, and regulatory setting."

While studies in heavily polluted megacities (e.g., Beijing) have typically revealed high nucleation rates coupled with slow particle growth, the mechanisms governing NPF under moderate pollution regimes remain poorly understood. Here, we report a distinct NPF pattern in the coastal city of Xiamen, characterized by relatively low nucleation rates but exceptionally rapid particle growth. Field observations and model simulations show that anthropogenic oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs), rather than sulfuric acid, dominate particle growth from the sub-3 nm size range. Despite a modest nucleation rate (J1.7 = 1.2 cm3 s–1), the observed high growth rate (GR7–15 = 7.2 nm h–1) is largely attributable to condensable organic vapors from anthropogenic sources. This efficient, anthropogenically driven growth pathway suggests that NPF could play a more substantial role in aerosol formation in many moderately polluted urban environments than currently recognized. We therefore urge the integration of such anthropogenic organic-driven growth mechanisms into atmospheric models to improve climate predictions."

In natural waters, cyanobacteria are often surrounded by symbiotic bacteria, whose influence on ozonation performance and underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Herein, we found that axenic filamentous cyanobacteria (Leptolyngbya sp.) exhibited strong resistance to ozonation (0.3 mg L–1, 20 min), whereas the presence of surface-associated bacteria markedly increased the cell rupture rate from 12 ± 6% to 76 ± 2%. Removal of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) significantly reduced ozonation resistance in axenic cyanobacteria but unexpectedly enhanced that of xenic cultures. By integrating reactive oxygen species identification, extracellular metabolomics, and metabolic reconstruction, we demonstrate that surface-colonizing bacteria degrade the algal LB-EPS envelope, releasing metabolites that facilitate hydroxyl radical formation during ozonation, thereby intensifying cell rupture. Our results highlight surface-associated bacteria as a critical yet overlooked factor shaping cyanobacterial responses to preozonation, underscoring the need to re-evaluate ozone application strategies in bloom-impacted waters to minimize cell rupture and byproduct formation."

However, insufficient analysis of influent toxicity and its city-level socioeconomic drivers has limited the development of effective wastewater management and treatment strategies. Here, we hypothesize that city-level socioeconomic conditions influence whole wastewater toxicity through specific molecular mediators, and we test this hypothesis using large-scale data from 100 WWTPs across China. The results indicated that cities with higher gross domestic product, greater population density, and more intensive industrial activity tend to produce influent with significantly higher toxicity (p < 0.05, generalized additive models). Mechanistically, this elevated toxicity was mediated by distinct molecular features, as CHO-class specific toxic precursors (R2 = 0.84), particularly unsaturated hydrocarbon–, condensed hydrocarbon–, and amino sugar–like compounds, were identified as the dominant molecular contributors to this toxicity based on ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Together, these findings demonstrate a molecular mediation pathway linking socioeconomic development to whole wastewater toxicity, highlighting the need for precision toxicity control strategies that prioritize economically developed cities, wherein WWTPs should target specific CHO-class toxic precursors."

However, little is known about their placental transfer and associated toxicity. Herein, we developed an approach integrating human biomonitoring, uterine perfusion experiments in pregnant rats, computational modeling, and in vitro placental cell bioassays. Nine of 30 PAAs including 8 PAAs with a monobenzene ring (e.g., aniline, ANI; ortho-toluidine, o-TD; para-toluidine, p-TD; ortho-anisidine, o-ANSD; 4-ethylaniline, 4-EA; 4-chloroaniline, 4-CA; and 3-chloroaniline, 3-CA) and 1 PAA with bis-benzene ring (2-naphthylamine, 2-NA), were widely detected (detection rate >50%) in 47 paired maternal and cord serum samples with median Σ9PAAs concentrations of 11.2 and 11.7 ng/mL, respectively. Transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PAAs were notably high, with median values ranging from 0.91 (p-CD) to 1.60 (2-NA), indicating efficient placental transfer. Excluding 2-NA, both biomonitoring data and rat uterine perfusion experiments revealed a significant negative correlation between log Kow and TTEs (or PAA concentrations in fetal rat), supporting passive diffusion as a mechanism involved in placental transfer of monoaromatic PAAs. Crucially, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that 2-NA forms dynamically stable complexes with specific solute carrier (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, suggesting a transporter-mediated active transport process. Cytotoxicity assays further indicated that 2-NA exhibited the highest toxicity among all PAAs. Moreover, in syncytialized BeWo cells, 2-NA exposure significantly compromised placental barrier integrity and function. The widespread presence of PAAs in maternal and fetal serum underscores the need for regulatory measures to reduce exposure, particularly among pregnant women and fetuses."

Ng;Pengfei Liu,Dynamic Evolution of Mass and Physical Properties of Atmospheric Organic Aerosol Under Solar Irradiance,"Organic aerosol (OA) particles constitute a substantial fraction of submicron particulate mass in the atmosphere and play a critical role in climate system. OA undergoes dynamic aging processes in the atmosphere, with photolytic aging induced by ultraviolet solar irradiance being an important yet poorly characterized mechanism. Knowledge gaps persist regarding the role of volatility transformations during photolytic aging on the OA mass decay kinetics and the evolution of climate-relevant properties, such as hygroscopicity, hindering the model evaluation of OA spatiotemporal distributions and atmospheric budgets. In this study, we conduct isothermal photolytic aging experiments on both laboratory-generated secondary organic aerosols and ambient-collected particles from urban Atlanta, utilizing a high-sensitivity Quartz Crystal Microbalance. Our results reveal that photolytic aging reduces 40–66% of the low-volatility OA mass with lifetimes ranging from 8 to 200 h under solar irradiance, and 44–92% of the photolytic mass loss is through slow evaporation of semi- or intermediate-volatile products, kinetically limited by their volatility. We observe up to ±50% changes in OA hygroscopicity with the transformation of fresh OA to photorecalcitrant low-volatility products, associated with changes in oxygen-to-carbon ratio and molecular weight. A kinetic model incorporating photolytic volatility transformation provides a cohesive explanation for the observed photolysis-induced changes in mass, volatility, and hygroscopicity. Our results can help constrain model representation of the dynamic evolutions of mass and climate-relevant properties during photolytic aging processes of the ambient OA, improving our understanding of OA atmospheric behavior and climate impact."

However, the origins of the critical class of small-molecule OSs (e.g., C2–C3 OSs) in ambient aerosols remain ambiguous. We investigated the abundance and composition of C2–C3 OSs in wintertime PM2.5 across 11 Chinese cities, along with their occurrence in primary aerosols from biomass burning, coal combustion, and vehicle emissions. Total C2–C3 OS abundance was higher in northern China than in southern China. The transformation of biogenic volatile organic compounds was a larger source of C2–C3 OSs in southern China (∼66%), whereas anthropogenic contributions (including biomass and coal combustion) dominated in the north. All investigated C2–C3 OSs were detected in primary combustion aerosols. The emission factor of total C2–C3 OSs in fresh PM2.5 generated from biomass burning was 0.42 ± 0.20 mg kg–1. The contribution of primary combustion sources likely led to a decrease in the proportion of secondarily formed C2–C3 OSs, particularly in northern China. Furthermore, reducing primary emissions caused by clean heating policies can markedly mitigate aerosol C2–C3 OS pollution, as exemplified by Beijing. This study provides novel field evidence for the primary emissions of aerosol C2–C3 OSs."

Here, we investigated the developmental neurotoxicity of IMI and its TPs. Zebrafish were exposed to IMI, DNIMI, IMIOL, DNIMIOL, and 5OHIMI (0.005–500 μg/L) for 120 h postfertilization (hpf). DNIMI and IMIOL showed greater developmental and behavioral toxicity than IMI and other TPs and were therefore selected (0.05–500 μg/L) for further toxicokinetic and recovery investigations. Although IMI, IMIOL, and DNIMI accumulated to comparable levels by 72 hpf, DNIMI and IMIOL were cleared substantially more slowly than IMI, which resulted in higher internal residues after the depuration period. Consistent with their prolonged internal exposure, zebrafish exposed to DNIMI and IMIOL exhibited sustained hypoactivity postdepuration, accompanied by significantly reduced glutamate (GLU) levels and alternated transcription of GLU-related genes. The partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) identified GLU as a pivotal role (variable importance projection scores ≥1, p < 0.05). DNIMI and IMIOL downregulated genes involved in GLU synthesis and metabolism, concurrently decreasing glutamate decarboxylase and glutaminase levels while increasing glutamine synthetase levels. Exogenous GLU coexposure alleviated the locomotor activity, neurotransmitter alternations, and transcriptional perturbations, confirming disrupted GLU signaling contributes to the neurotoxicity of DNIMI and IMIOL. Overall, IMI-TPs induced stronger developmental neurotoxicity than IMI in zebrafish via GLU pathway disruption, highlighting their enhanced neurotoxic risks in aquatic environments."

Anthropogenic land‐use could be an important forcing regionally, but available population‐based estimates differ widely. We examine transient Holocene climate model simulations forced with three population‐based disturbed‐land reconstructions and compare this with a fourth scenario derived entirely from fossil pollen records. The direct biophysical temperature effects are broadly similar across the scenarios but the pollen‐based product suggests an earlier onset of disturbance, particularly in China and accounting for its limited spatial coverage, falls closer to the upper limit of the existing uncertainty range. Impacts in many areas begin during the mid‐Holocene but emergence of a signal varies spatially with earliest impacts over Europe, China and the North Atlantic. Significant uncertainties remain, and these could be tackled by improving the representation of land‐use effects in climate models or by merging different information sources related to Holocene land‐use."

Wivell;M. K. Dougherty;A. Masters,The Dynamic Inducing Magnetic Field Signal at Triton,"Triton, Neptune's largest moon, is suspected of harboring a subsurface ocean. Detecting sub‐surface oceans requires measuring the ocean's induced magnetic field, typically exploiting common frequencies at which the field environment of the moon changes, in this case Triton's path through Neptune's magnetosphere. Triton's orbit around Neptune, whilst nearly completely circular, is highly inclined, with an inclination of approximately 157° to Neptune's equator. This results in a rotation signal strength and frequency which has significant orbital dependence, unlike at other ocean worlds. The work conducted in this study highlights how the inducing signal at Triton is dynamic in both power and frequency caused by Triton's high inclination. This means that there is a richer set of frequency signals than previously thought, that may be useful for induction studies. This work quantifies the effect that Triton's inclination has on the inducing signal, and rules out other potential sources of signal disruption."

We show that the spread in PI across GCMs is primarily driven by differences in outflow temperature, a consequence of different upper atmospheric temperatures. To explore the impacts of these biases on TC activity, we conduct several idealized experiments with altered temperature profiles. In these experiments, global TC frequency and accumulated cyclone energy change by ∼35% and hurricane frequency by ∼80%. There are smaller but still significant impacts on lifetime maximum intensity. These findings highlight an underappreciated role of upper atmospheric model biases in modulating TC activity in GCMs, how future changes in TC activity may be influenced by responses of upper atmospheric temperature to anthropogenic emissions, and that TCs are more directly influenced by PI than SST alone."

The third waves drive oceanic energy cascade, yet under what conditions these waves are generated remain poorly quantified. This study employs an integrated approach combining multi‐mooring observations, causality analysis, and high‐resolution regional simulations (i.e., 2 km, 60 levels) in the Northern South China Sea (NSCS) to address this knowledge gap. Both field observations and numerical simulations reveal that at stations near the tropical cyclone (TC) track, third‐wave kinetic energy doubled after TC passage, while vertical penetration depths dramatically shoaled. Causality analysis demonstrates that NIWs dominate third‐wave generation at these sites, exceeding IT contributions by a factor of 9.4. In contrast, tide‐dominated stations farther from TC path showed slight energy increases with balanced NIW‐IT contributions. This study provides the first three‐dimensional, causality‐constrained perspective on how TC and ITs selectively control third‐wave generation through nonlinear interactions."

This study employs high‐resolution vegetation data and RegCM5.0‐CLM4.5 simulations to assess the impacts of vegetation change on the QTP. Through sensitivity experiments involving alterations in plant functional types and leaf area index (LAI), the effects on temperature and hydrological cycles are evaluated. The results indicate that from 2000 to 2020, notable increases in LAI were concentrated in the eastern QTP. When only bare land changed to grassland, there was significant warming on the plateau. When LAI also increased, temperature was influenced by both evaporation and albedo changes.

These pollution events coincide with agricultural waste burning, emitting large quantities of carbon monoxide (CO) into the troposphere. Using 18 years of Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) measurements from the Metop satellites, we examined the interannual variability of CO concentrations over the IGP during the post‐monsoon season from 2007 to 2024. We focused on three representative years with varying CO levels (2011, 2017, and 2024) to determine whether CO pollution events in the IGP were more influenced by fire intensity, represented by the Fire Radiative Power (FRP) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers, or by meteorological parameters, particularly average winds in the 0–2 km layer, provided by ERA5 reanalysis. The comparison of wind patterns and FRP showed that surface winds primarily drive CO pollution severity. Extreme CO concentrations were found in 2017 and 2024 which coincided with prolonged periods of weak surface winds. In contrast, 2011 exhibited moderate CO concentrations throughout the post‐monsoon season due to stronger winds, despite higher FRP. Our findings highlight the influence of surface winds in conditioning extreme post‐monsoon pollution episodes in the IGP and demonstrate the ability of IASI for long‐term monitoring of regional air pollution caused by agricultural waste burning. However, these results rely on the accurate detection of fire activity, which remains challenging due to limitations in satellite observations and changes in agricultural practices."

 Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infects ≈90-95% of the global population1,2 and persists in B cells as a life-long infection3. Prior EBV-infection is associated with autoimmune and neoplastic disease4. Still, the biological basis of host control during EBV persistence remains unclear. Here, we report the identification of non-genetic and genetic factors that are associated with EBV control during persistent infection. Using blood-based genome sequence (GS) data from 486,315 UK Biobank and 336,123 All of Us participants, we identified short read-pairs mapping to the EBV genome in 16.2% and 21.8% of individuals, respectively. EBV-read detection (EBVread+) reflects increased viral load in blood cells, as shown by orthogonal measurements, and was associated with HIV infection, immunosuppressive drug intake, and current smoking. Genome-wide analyses of EBVread+ identified strong associations at the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), including 54 independent HLA-alleles of MHC class I and II, and at 27 genomic regions outside MHC. Epistasis with distinct HLA-alleles of MHC class I was observed at the ERAP2 locus. Analysis of individuals with EBV-associated diseases4 revealed a higher polygenic burden of EBVread+ for HLA-alleles at MHC class I in multiple sclerosis (driven by HLA-A*02:01), and at MHC class II in rheumatoid arthritis. Phenome-wide analyses identified a polygenic overlap of EBVread+ with inflammatory bowel disease, hypothyroidism, and type 1 diabetes. Our study establishes by-products of human GS as a surrogate marker of EBV viral load. This will facilitate investigation and treatment for EBV and other persistent viral infections."

 Well-being is linked to income. However, lower well-being among lower-income individuals may reflect either economic relative deprivation or the lower social status associated with a lower income rank. Here, using Gallup World Poll data from 109 countries and over 90,000 individuals, we test a general model that includes both relative income deprivation and income rank as special cases. In 80% of countries, subjective well-being is more strongly associated with within-nation rank of income than with absolute income or relative income deprivation. Income rank coefficients are over three times larger in the most materialistic countries, but smaller in countries with higher social capital: In countries with the highest civic engagement, the association between income rank and well-being is about 80% smaller. Results replicated in multiple survey years and are consistent with a link between income-related social status and subjective well-being that is stronger when social capital is low.

 RNA design aims to find a sequence that can fold into a target secondary structure. It can create artificial RNA molecules for specific functions, with wide applications in medicine. It is computationally challenging due to two levels of combinatorial explosion: the exponentially large design space and the exponentially many competing structures per design. Popular methods such as local search cannot keep up with these combinatorial explosions. We instead employ two techniques from machine learning, continuous optimization and Monte-Carlo sampling. We start from a distribution over all valid sequences, and use gradient descent to improve the expectation of an arbitrary objective function. We define novel coupled-variable distributions to model the correlation between nucleotides. We then use sampling to approximate the objective, estimate the gradient, and select the final candidate. Our work consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics including Boltzmann probability and ensemble defect, especially on long and hard-to-design structures.

 Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain cancer with limited treatment options and poor patient survival, driven in part by cellular diversity within tumors. While individual cell types have been catalogued, how malignant, vascular, and immune cells are spatially organized inside human tumors remains incompletely understood. Here we show a spatially resolved, multi-modal atlas of human glioblastoma that integrates gene expression profiling across tissue sections with matched single-cell and protein measurements at subcellular resolution. Using a targeted 348 gene panel enriched for vascular and stromal markers, we identify less well-characterized endothelial, perivascular, and fibroblast-like cell states and define their spatial associations with malignant and immune compartments. We further identify a distinct oligodendrocyte population restricted to tumor core and perivascular regions that exhibits gene expression patterns associated with tumor recurrence and poor clinical outcome. This publicly accessible atlas provides a high-resolution framework for studying the spatial organization of glioblastoma and highlights region-specific cellular interactions that may represent therapeutically actionable vulnerabilities.

 C-prenylated flavonoids possess notable pharmaceutical potential, but their production is hindered by the challenging selective prenylation of their unstable polyphenolic cores. Natural prenyltransferases offer a direct route but suffer from low activity and incomplete mechanistic understanding. Here, we report a directed evolution strategy to reshape the active pocket of the prenyltransferase AtaPT, uncovering an aromatic cage that governs both regioselectivity and donor specificity. By tuning cage occupancy, we engineer three mutants with high chemo- and regioselectivity toward dimethylallyl diphosphate or geranyl pyrophosphate. Structural analysis and molecular simulations validate the role of the cage in guiding flavonoid prenylation. Notably, the aromatic cage mechanism observed in AtaPT is not unique and can be recapitulated in homologous enzymes. Introduction of the aromatic cage consistently enhances both activity and selectivity, confirming its crucial role. AtaPT mutants enable the efficient and scalable synthesis of 27 C-prenylated flavonoids, including 8 previously unreported compounds. With an integrated donor regeneration system, preparative-scale biotransformations achieve product titers up to 400 mg/L.

Here, the authors assess effects of >7000 mutations in a model PDZ domain, to quantify how two small extensions to a protein domain reshape its energetic and allosteric landscape. 
 Many functions of proteins are performed by independently folding structural units called domains. These domains are structurally conserved but not identical in different proteins. Here, to understand the consequences for regulation and evolvability of domain extensions, we quantify the energetic effects of two extensions in a model protein domain. Quantifying abundance and ligand binding for >190,000 protein variants allows us to measure the free energy changes for mutations throughout a PDZ domain and ~7000 energetic couplings between these mutations and two domain extensions. Both a structured extension and a more dynamic extension substantially but specifically re-shape the energy landscape. In particular, deleting an ɑ-helix alters the energetic consequences of >400 mutations in >50 sites on fold stability or binding energy, and the effects of >300 allosteric mutations, including at solvent-accessible surface sites. Extending or pruning the domain therefore reshapes its energetic and allosteric landscape, adding and removing opportunities for the allosteric control of protein function. Independently folding domains can be seen as the functional and evolutionary structural units of proteins.

 Understanding Asian summer monsoon changes during the last deglaciation through the oxygen isotope offers insights into future hydroclimate. However, the cause of limited glacial-interglacial shifts in oxygen isotope over eastern China remains unknown. Here, combining oxygen isotope records with isotope-enabled climate simulations, we identify a pronounced east-west contrast in glacial-interglacial oxygen isotope amplitudes between South Asia (larger changes) and eastern China (muted signal), despite comparable precipitation changes. This contrast is driven primarily by ice-sheet forcing, with opposing effects from orbital and greenhouse-gas further damping the isotope response in eastern China. Water-tagging experiments reveal that the weaker eastern China signal reflects competing processes: depletion primarily driven by increased Pacific-sourced moisture from a strengthened northwestward-shifted Western Pacific Subtropical High, alongside enrichment resulting from reduced rainout and enhanced local recycling over the marginal seas. These findings mechanistically reconcile puzzling differences between water isotope and other hydrological proxies across monsoon region on glacial-interglacial variability.

 Alpine rivers are becoming increasingly exposed to atmospheric heatwaves. Because of their strong relationship with air temperature, rivers can experience persistent heat anomalies, known as riverine heatwaves, which can have serious consequences for river ecosystems and the economy. This study aims to improve our understanding of how river water temperature responds to atmospheric heatwaves by focusing on the interplay of various hydro-climatic variables that can strengthen or weaken the thermal sensitivity of rivers to such events. Our results show that the response of water temperature to atmospheric heatwaves can vary substantially, with only 47% of atmospheric heatwaves leading to riverine heatwaves. Riverine heatwave development can be prevented by positive anomalies in discharge and meltwater, while negative anomalies in discharge strengthen the link between atmospheric and river temperatures. Future changes in these hydro-climatic conditions will likely increase the sensitivity of Alpine rivers to atmospheric heatwaves.

 Since 2005, the Campi Flegrei nested caldera volcano, located about 10 km west of Naples, Italy, has experienced accelerating uplift accompanied by increased seismicity, raising concerns in this densely populated area. This ongoing uplift is part of a millennium-long history of inflation-deflation cycles, in which seismicity correlates with uplift phases, albeit nonlinearly. Here, we show that the combination of stress shadowing and loading with frictional fault behavior reproduces the observed long-term seismicity trend. However, in the short term, earthquake clustering occurs, which we demonstrate is at least partly related to earthquake interactions and can be effectively modeled by overlapping aftershock sequences. Merging the long- and short-term approaches yields a combined model that effectively replicates the observed seismicity patterns. A pseudo-prospective test shows that the model can also provide probabilistic short-term forecasts of earthquake rates and maximum magnitudes on weekly to monthly time horizons. The complex seismicity at Campi Flegrei caldera can be reliably simulated and forecasted using a model that combines rate-and-state frictional response with epidemic-type aftershock sequence modeling."

 A 10-fold enhancement of lithium atoms was detected at 96 km altitude by a resonance lidar at Kühlungsborn, Germany, approximately 20 hours after the uncontrolled re-entry of a Falcon 9 upper stage. The upper-atmospheric extension of the ICON general circulation model, nudged to ECMWF, was used to calculate winds. Backwards trajectories, including wind variability as measured by radar, traced air masses to the Falcon 9 re-entry path at 100 km altitude, west of Ireland. This study presents the first measurement of upper-atmospheric pollution resulting from space debris re-entry and the first observational evidence that the ablation of space debris can be detected by ground-based lidar. The analysis of geomagnetic conditions, atmospheric dynamics, and ionospheric measurements supports the claim that the enhancement was not of natural origin. Our findings demonstrate that identifying pollutants and tracing them to their sources is achievable, with significant implications for monitoring and mitigating space emissions in the atmosphere.

VH. 
 This study aims to investigate the potential of sub-diurnal C-band radar data for maize crop monitoring. To this end, a tower-based experiment equipped with a C-band radar antenna (15-min acquisition interval) was conducted in a maize field in 2021. In situ measurements of soil and vegetation were carried out between September and December 2021. To analyze the radar response to plant water stress, a period of induced stress was implemented around the development peak. Both the temporal coherence (ρ) and radar backscattering coefficient (σ 0) are analyzed. The analysis shows that the temporal coherence exhibits a marked daily cycle. More specifically, a morning drop (Δ|ρ|morning) was observed prior to the onset of wind. Previous studies on wheat crops and olive orchards have attributed this drop to the onset of the plant's physiological activity at dawn. The daily mean σ0 values across all three polarizations were strongly correlated with both evapotranspiration (ETR) and evaporative fraction during both the growth and maturity stages (r > 0.60). This observed correlation is due to structural changes in the canopy as vegetation grows, associated with increased transpiration. Despite significant differences in acquisition configurations between tower-based radar measurements and Sentinel-1, a remarkable overall agreement is observed between both datasets. In contrast to ρ, Sentinel-1 σ 0 detects the water stress period, with a decrease of about 2 dB coinciding with intensifying water stress.

 Understanding the temporal scales that govern aerosol build-up and persistence is essential for diagnosing urban air-quality variability under complex atmospheric forcing. This study develops a multi-parametric, frequency-domain framework for 131 non-attainment cities across India’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) using CEEMDAN decomposition. A combined Earth Observation and reanalysis dataset is used to extract frequency-domain variability, with independent in-situ PM2.5 observations employed for validation.Each parameter is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), and their normalized energies are integrated into multi-parameter spectral signatures to identify coherent regimes of atmospheric variability. Seven characteristic cluster types are identified, reflecting synoptic-dominated regimes, turbulence-driven regimes, hybrid synoptic–turbulent modes, and mixed regimes shaped by persistent thermal or moisture anomalies. These signatures differentiate cities regulated by slow-evolving aerosol–moisture coupling from those driven by rapid boundary-layer or wind-shear fluctuations. Winter clusters capture inversion-linked stagnation, pre-monsoon clusters reflect dust-modulated synoptic forcing, monsoon clusters align with convective–stratiform transitions, and post-monsoon clusters are shaped by biomass burning and shallow boundary layers.The framework translates frequency-domain variability into physically interpretable ventilation regimes, offering the first demonstration of how signal decomposition can quantify intrinsic atmospheric capacity for pollutant accumulation and dispersion at the city scale. These insights enable a process-based classification of NCAP cities, supporting dynamic airshed characterization and season-specific emission-control planning."

As a precocial species, chicks can be tested shortly after hatching, allowing us to control their pretest experiences. Similar to humans, both 3-day-old [Experiment 1 (Exp. 1)] and 1-day-old (Exp. 2) chicks spontaneously choose a spiky shape when hearing the “kiki” sound and a round shape when hearing the “bouba” sound.

We found that in some mammalian cells, including neurons, stress also resulted in the formation of inactive ribosome-ribosome clusters (disomes). We used cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize ribosomes in situ and observed that this ribosome dimerization was mediated by a homotypic interaction of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expansion segment ES31Lb. ES31Lb interactions were both necessary and sufficient for disome formation and conferred a growth advantage and stress resistance to brain cells. ES31Lb is predicted to homodimerize in ~20% of chordates, including variants in both chicken and human. Cryo-ET analysis of chicken tetrasomes revealed an interaction between ES31Lb and ES9La. Thus, in animal cells, translation regulation can use a flexible component of the protein synthesis machinery—rRNA expansion segments."

Thorkelsson;Agnieszka Fatalska;George Hodgson;Maximillian Dalglish;Chao Wang;Anne Bertolotti,Termination of the integrated stress response,"Stress responses enable cells to detect, adapt to, and survive challenges. The benefit of these signaling pathways depends on their reversibility. The integrated stress response (ISR) is elicited by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2, which traps and inhibits rate-limiting translation factor eIF2B, thereby attenuating translation initiation. Termination of this pathway thus requires relieving eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition. Here, we found that eIF2 phosphatase subunits PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B (R15B) bound P-eIF2 in complex with eIF2B. Biochemical investigations guided by cryo–electron microscopy structures of native eIF2-eIF2B and P-eIF2-eIF2B complexes bound to R15B demonstrated that R15B enabled dephosphorylation of otherwise dephosphorylation-incompetent P-eIF2 on eIF2B. This sheds light on ISR termination, revealing that R15B rescues eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition, thereby safeguarding translation and cell fitness."

FhaB-CT delivery is required to occupy a niche at the base of cilia in airway epithelia, and mutant bacteria lacking this domain are defective for nasal colonization. These observations suggest that FhaB-CT is transferred into motile respiratory cilia to interact with core axonemal microtubules. We propose thatBordetellaadheres initially to the tips of cilia and then deploys multiple FhaB adhesins to migrate to the base of the cilia forest, where the bacteria resist removal by the mucociliary “escalator” that normally clears the respiratory tract of microbes."

We found that in mice, ACC theta oscillations are involved in empathy-driven prosocial allogrooming. Moreover, orexinergic neurons are selectively activated in the ACC during observational fear and prosocial allogrooming, but only when the animals had prior fear experience. Real-time, gaze-dependent optogenetic inhibition of lateral hypothalamic orexinergic inputs to ACC suppressed theta power and reduced both behaviors. These findings show that hypothalamic orexinergic inputs drive ACC theta oscillations to modulate observational fear and prosocial behaviors, providing circuit-level insight into how affective empathy translates into prosocial action."

Longitudinal single-cell tracking suggested that improved hormone responsiveness reflects increasing activity of SC-α and -β cells with low and high basal firing, linked to induction of energy and hormone metabolism genes. Daily metabolic entrainment showed that circadian hormone secretion rhythms reflect daily oscillation of SC-α and -β electrical characteristics, tied to induction of cell-cell communication and exocytic gene networks, revealing circadian coordination of cell-level, stimulus-coupled responses.

Joint inversion of teleseismic and InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for the space-time slip distribution, with validation by means of forward modeling of deep-water tsunami recordings, revealed a southwestward elongated large-slip patch on the curved plate boundary.

The resulting broadband spectra captured fundamental vibrational modes together with rich overtone and combination bands inaccessible by conventional methods, which we confirmed with isotopic substitutions.

Proofreading is typically assumed to evolve when selection for fidelity outweighs costs in energy and the speed of replication. We show that when stalling after misincorporations is accounted for, proofreading can instead speed up replication. Consistent with data on polymerase mutagenesis, our results suggest that proofreading can evolve under selection for speed alone. We generalize to multicomponent self-assembly and show that analogous error-correcting processes, such as dynamic instability, can likewise emerge purely from selection for rapid assembly. Thus, nonequilibrium error correction can evolve from selection for speed, even without direct fidelity advantages. We discuss implications for mutation-rate evolution, molecular assembly processes, and models of early life."

We infer that these rocks formed by olivine accumulation in an igneous system of layered intrusions, followed by exposure to water and carbon dioxide, which caused extensive carbonation of the silicate minerals. Aqueous alteration was more pronounced at lower elevations. Higher-elevation exposures on the crater rim appear similar to olivine-rich rocks distributed over the wider Nili Fossae region."

Mitani;Hiroshi Fujishima;Yoichi Minami;Eiichi Morii;Rikuhiro G. Yamada;Seiji Okada;Hiroki R. Ueda,A whole-brain single-cell atlas of circadian neural activity in mice,"The mammalian brain comprises numerous anatomical regions with distinct functions despite their extensive connectivity. How spontaneous neural activity is coordinated across regions over the circadian cycle remains elusive. We used tissue clearing and whole-brain c-Fos immunostaining on 144 mouse brains collected over 2 days under constant darkness. Time-series analysis revealed brainwide circadian rhythmicity at single-cell resolution, with 79% of the 642 anatomically defined regions oscillating in diverse circadian phases that delineate functional specializations. Voxelwise analyses further highlighted distinct subregions, suggesting intricate spatiotemporal coordination within regions. Additionally, brain circadian time could be accurately inferred from global c-Fos patterns using omics-derived prediction methods. This whole-brain circadian atlas enhances our understanding of neural coordination and provides a resource for integrating time-of-day information into functional and pharmacological research."

Roth,The functional landscape of coding variation in the familial hypercholesterolemia gene LDLR,"Variants in the familial hypercholesterolemia geneLDLR—the most important genetic driver of cardiovascular disease—can raise circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations and increase the risk of premature atherosclerosis. Definitive classifications are lacking for nearly half of clinically encounteredLDLRmissense variants, limiting interventions that reduce disease burden. We tested the impact of ~17,000 (nearly all possible)LDLRcoding variants on both LDLR cell-surface abundance and LDL uptake, yielding sequence–function maps that recapitulate known biochemistry, offer functional insights, and provide evidence for interpreting clinical variants. Functional scores correlated with hyperlipidemia phenotypes in prospective human cohorts and augmented polygenic scores to improve risk inference, highlighting the potential of this resource to accelerate familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis and improve patient outcomes."
