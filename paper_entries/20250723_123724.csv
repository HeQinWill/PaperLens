However, the current AQI in India does not consider the health impacts of exposure to air pollutants, necessitating the development of air quality health index (AQHI). Here, we proposed a framework for developing city-specific AQHI that better reflects local air quality and associated health risks using air pollution and health data from two polluted and densely populated cities in north India—Delhi and Varanasi (Delhi: 2013–2017; Varanasi: 2009–2016). We also constructed a pooled AQHI by combining data from both cities. Using concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, we applied generalized additive models with a quasi-Poisson link, using daily mortality counts as the outcome, excluding suicide and accidental deaths. A 10 µg m−3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with mortality increases of 0.17% (95% CI: 0.01–0.34) in Varanasi, 0.20% (95% CI: 0.1–0.29) in Delhi, and 0.16% (95% CI: 0.08–0.24) in the pooled model. The city-specific AQHI classified 21.8% of days in Delhi as ‘Satisfactory’ versus 18.2% by the pooled index, while 24.2% of days were ‘Poor’ compared to 30.1% under the pooled index. In Varanasi, 6.8% of days were ‘Good’ under the city-specific AQHI, compared to 9.3% by the pooled index, with 15.7% of days classified as ‘Poor’ versus 19.3% by the pooled index. Our results suggest that a single-pooled AQHI may misrepresent local air quality and associated health risks. Since AQHI values are derived from excess mortality risk estimates, a city-specific AQHI ensures a more accurate reflection of local pollution-related health impacts, supporting targeted public health interventions. We recommend accessibility of health data to enable developing AQHI for non-attainment cities in India and use it to track progress towards cleaner air."

This study introduces a quantitative method for determining albedo thresholds to delineate areas of dark ice, which detects abrupt changes in the mean and linear trends in time series of weather station albedo measurements in documented dark ice areas. Four different stages of albedo change during the melt season are easily identified within data derived from program for monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Greenland climate network automatic weather station located in dark ice areas. The third stage is defined as the dark ice period, during which the albedo decline rate is lowest, gradually converging to the minimum annual value. The derived broadband albedo thresholds are α < 0.451 and 0.431 for use with discrete data mapping and linear trend analysis, respectively. We recommend that the latter threshold is used because it can better indicate albedo trend changes. The thresholds were applied to harmonized Landsat and Sentinel 2 ice albedo and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MOD10A1 albedo products to analyze dark ice variations at local (30 m) and regional (500 m) scales on the ice sheet. Our findings reveal notable inter-annual and daily variations in dark ice areas, in line with previous studies. Dark ice occupies, on average, 60% of the bare ice area, and the transition from bare to dark ice averaged 5–6 d across the ice sheet. The impacts of the different thresholds applied are relatively minor."
10.1088/1748-9326/adeeac,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注南亚地区干旱对植被的影响，以及水文气候因素在其中的作用。虽然研究使用了植被指标，可能涉及遥感数据，但其核心在于分析干旱、土壤湿度、水汽压亏缺和二氧化碳浓度等因素如何影响植被生长，而非直接研究大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['drought', 'vegetation', 'hydroclimatic factors', 'soil moisture', 'vapor pressure deficit', 'aCO2', 'remote sensing (indirectly through vegetation indices)']",Rafi Riaz;Zhang Jie;Irfan Ullah;Akintomide Afolayan Akinsanola;Sidra Syed;Chemeda Tizazu Geremew;Kaleem Ullah;Muhammad Qasim,Seasonal contrast in dryland vegetation response to meteorological drought across South Asia,"Understanding vegetation sensitivity to drought in South Asia is essential due to the region’s exposure to frequent, seasonally varying drought driven by complex hydroclimatic factors. This study addresses a significant knowledge gap by investigating seasonal vegetation-drought sensitivity using multiple vegetation indicators and the influence of hydroclimatic factors. Our results show vegetation-drought sensitivity peaks in spring, rising from 0.2 in summer to 0.6, with drought-prone areas expanding from 40% to 60%. Along with drought-vegetation sensitivities, the other hydroclimatic factor’s role played a wide range of dependency on the phenological stages of vegetation. For instance, a statistically significant positive correlation between increasing soil moisture–temperature coupling and decreased vegetation growth was detected from spring to summer in Pakistan and India, with an average sensitivity of 0.2–0.6 in all seasons. Vapor pressure deficit dominates vegetation responses, especially in summer and autumn, with central and northwestern croplands showing higher sensitivity, while humid northeastern parts remain resilient. Elevated aCO2 amplifies drought effects in the spring, highlighting the vital role of seasonal water balance and hydroclimatic dynamics. Policy-makers should integrate these insights into regional drought management and climate adaptation strategies to support sustainable agricultural practices and ecosystem conservation."

10.5194/acp-25-7699-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文分析了戈壁沙漠的沙尘暴将蛋白质物质（氨基酸）输送到中国北方的情况。通过测量戈壁沙漠土壤和植被以及中国北方四个城市PM2.5样本中氨基酸的浓度和氮同位素值，发现沙尘暴携带的氨基酸富含丙氨酸、甘氨酸和谷氨酸。研究表明，戈壁沙漠的沙尘暴可以将大量的蛋白质氮输送到中国北方，从而影响当地的生态系统生产力。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究内容与大气成分分析、空气质量监测密切相关，特别是关于沙尘暴这种大气现象的组成和影响。,"['PM2.5', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring', 'dust transport', 'nitrogen deposition', 'amino acids']",Ren-Guo Zhu;Hua-Yun Xiao;Meiju Yin;Hao Xiao;Zhongkui Zhou;Yuanyuan Pan;Guo Wei;Cheng Liu,Asian dust transport of proteinaceous matter from the Gobi Desert to northern China,"The concentrations and δ15N isotopic values of CAAs (combined amino acids) in surface soil and plants from the Gobi Desert, as well as in PM2.5 samples from four cities in Northern China, were measured. CAAs transported by Gobi dust were rich in alanine, glycine and glutamic acid. Glycine and leucine in Gobi Desert sources exhibited δ15N depletion by more than 6 ‰ compared to their values in urban PM2.5. Substantial protein-N deposition can be transported by the Gobi Desert to northern China over brief periods. 
 Asian dust can greatly influence the ecosystem's productivity and biogeochemical cycles by providing new nutrients. However, the transport of proteinaceous matter (combined amino acids, CAAs) by Asian dust to downwind ecosystems remains unclear. Here, the concentrations and δ15N values of individual CAAs in Gobi surface soil and vegetation and in PM2.5 samples from four cities in northern China were characterized. Proline dominated the total pool of CAAs in urban PM2.5 during non-dust periods, whereas CAAs transported by Gobi dust were rich in alanine, glycine and glutamic acid. The concentrations and percentages of these three CAAs in PM2.5 from northern China notably increased during dust periods. During non-dust periods, the δ15N values of individual CAAs in urban PM2.5 fell within their respective ranges in local urban sources, suggesting CAAs in PM2.5 were primarily influenced by local urban sources during non-dust periods. Compared to their values in urban PM2.5 during non-dust periods, glycine and leucine in Gobi Desert sources exhibited δ15N depletion by more than 6 ‰. During dust periods, glycine and leucine in urban PM2.5 all exhibited negative shifts in their δ15N values, confirming that Gobi dust is a significant source of CAAs in PM2.5 in northern China. The dry deposition of protein N from Gobi dust was calculated using nitrogen isotopic mass balance based on the δ15N values of glycine and leucine, yielding a value of up to 0.36 mgNm-2d-1. The rapid accumulation of such considerable protein N quantities may profoundly affect oligotrophic ecosystem productivity."

Murphy;Douglas Kinnison;Jian Guan,Two-years of stratospheric chemistry perturbations from the 2019–2020 Australian wildfire smoke,"The Australian 2019–2020 wildfires injected a substantial amount of smoke into the upper atmosphere, causing unusual chemical reactions that altered the chemical makeup of the upper atmosphere. This led to ozone depletion in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes that likely did not fully recover until 2 years after the initial event due to the persistent chemical effects of the smoke. 
 The very large pyrocumulonimbus events that occurred during the Australian summer of 2019–2020 caused extremely unusual partitioning of stratospheric chlorine in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude and Antarctic regions not only in 2020 but also in 2021. This was likely caused by enhanced HCl solubility in organic species that increased heterogeneous chemistry. Here, we show that observed HCl and ClONO2 values remain outside the pre-wildfire satellite range, measured from 2005 until just prior to the event, in both the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude and Antarctic regions in 2021. Through model simulations, we replicate this prolonged multiyear chemical perturbation, in good agreement with observations. This was achieved by calculating the HCl solubility in mixed wildfire and sulfate aerosols consistent with assumptions of (1) liquid–liquid phase separation and (2) linear dependence on organic and sulfate composition. The model simulations also suggest that the Australian pyrocumulonimbus organic aerosols contributed to low midlatitude ozone values in 2020 and 2021. A marked, photochemically controlled seasonality of the chemical perturbations and ozone depletion is also observed and simulated, and its underlying chemical drivers are identified. This work highlights that lower concentrations of smoke still had profound effects on stratospheric heterogeneous chemistry more than a year after the 2019–2020 wildfire event."

Popovicheva;Marina A. Chichaeva;Nikolaos Evangeliou;Sabine Eckhardt;Evangelia Diapouli;Nikolay S. Kasimov,Multi-year black carbon observations and modeling close to the largest gas flaring and wildfire regions in the Western Siberian Arctic,"High-quality measurements of light-absorbing carbon were performed at the polar aerosol station ""Island Bely” (Western Siberian Arctic) from 2019 to 2022. The maximum light absorption coefficients were seen in summer due to gas flaring, which is the most significant source in the region. However, the increasing Siberian wildfires had a special share in carbon contribution at this high Arctic station, with a persistent smoke layer extending over the whole troposphere in summer. 
 The influence of aerosols on the Arctic system remains associated with significant uncertainties, particularly concerning black carbon (BC). The polar aerosol station “Island Bely” (IBS), located in the Western Siberian Arctic, was established to enhance aerosol monitoring. Continuous measurements from 2019 to 2022 revealed the long-term effects of light-absorbing carbon. During the cold period, the annual average light-absorption coefficient was 0.7 ± 0.7 Mm−1, decreasing by 2–3 times during the warm period. The interannual mean showed a peak in February (0.9 ± 0.8 Mm−1) then 10 times the lower minimum in June and exhibited high variability in August (0.7 ± 2.2 Mm−1). An increase of up to 1.5 at shorter wavelengths from April to September suggests contribution from brown carbon (BrC). The annual mean equivalent black carbon (eBC) demonstrated considerable interannual variability, with the lowest in 2020 (24 ± 29 ng m−3). Significant difference was observed between Arctic haze and Siberian wildfire periods, with record-high pollution levels in February 2022 (110 ± 70 ng m−3) and August 2021 (83 ± 249 ng m−3). Anthropogenic BC contributed 83 % to the total for the entire study period, and gas flaring, domestic combustion, transportation, and industrial emissions dominated. During the cold season, > 90 % of surface BC was attributed to anthropogenic sources, mainly gas flaring. In contrast, during the warm period, Siberian wildfires contributed to BC concentrations by 48 %. In August 2021, intense smoke from Yakutian wildfires was transported at high altitudes during the region's worst fire season in 40 years."

 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent a pivotal driver of global climate change, with vehicular emissions, particularly from light-duty vehicles, emerging as a prominent source of GHGs. Despite extensive research on gaseous pollutants, studies on GHG emissions within the framework of carbon neutrality remain scarce. This study delves into the emission characteristics of three primary GHGs (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)) from various light-duty vehicles, encompassing conventional gasoline and hybrid vehicles and bi-fuel taxis. As anticipated, with advancements in emission standards and powertrains, vehicular GHG emissions have significantly decreased. However, our findings also revealed surprising trends. While engine technology upgrades reduced CO2, they unexpectedly increased CH4 and N2O emissions. Additionally, hot starts, beneficial for reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions, caused heightened N2O emissions, which is noteworthy under operating conditions with frequent start–stop events. Intriguingly, compressed natural gas (CNG), generally perceived as cleaner, increased CH4 emissions. Regarding the impact of three-way-catalyst (TWC) converters on GHG emissions, under “TWC deteriorated” conditions, N2O emissions from CNG-powered vehicles were approximately 3 times higher than those under “TWC worked” conditions, which can be attributed to the significant increase in nitrogen oxides (NOx). Considering the global warming potential (GWP), the “TWC deteriorated” scenario paradoxically decreased GWP values, highlighting the complex interaction between emission control technologies and their environmental impacts. This study provides crucial insights into vehicular GHG emissions, which are essential for developing effective strategies aimed at mitigating emissions and enhancing the efficiency of emission control systems."

Its spectral slope contains information about the source region or transport paths of the observed aerosol. The extension to 1064 nm is a recent development led by our institute. We gathered previous observations and added new ones to provide the spectral slope for the most important aerosol types such as marine and continental aerosol, dust, smoke, and sulfate. We compared it to assumptions used for spaceborne backscatter lidars. 
 The extinction-to-backscatter ratio, also known as the lidar ratio, is an important quantity in active remote sensing with lidar. It is a key parameter in aerosol typing and an essential quantity to derive the extinction coefficient from elastic backscatter lidars like the spaceborne Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) or ceilometer observations. The present study discusses the spectral dependence of the lidar ratio from the frequently measured lidar ratios at 355 and 532 nm to the rarely observed lidar ratio at 1064 nm. Therefore, a special focus is put on the rotational Raman lidar method applied to the emission wavelength of 1064 nm. We present a literature review on existing triple-wavelength lidar ratio observations and add new measurements for marine and continental aerosol. For cirrus clouds and marine and continental aerosol the spectral behavior is neutral; for sulfate aerosol, we see a decrease from 532 to 1064 nm. In the case of mineral dust, the lidar ratio slightly increases towards 1064 nm, and in the case of aged smoke an increase with wavelength is found. Furthermore, we observe an increase in the lidar ratio with relative humidity for continental aerosol and report hygroscopic growth factors. The findings are compared to the assumptions made in the CALIPSO version 4 automated aerosol classification and lidar ratio selection algorithm (Kim et al., 2018). We could confirm these assumptions for marine and sulfate aerosol. However, we see slight differences for mineral dust and continental aerosol and pronounced differences for elevated smoke."

The methodology is described, and the quality of the wind and temperature observations is evaluated against radiosonde and other aircraft observations. 
 Wind and temperature observations from aircraft are of major importance for aviation meteorology and numerical weather prediction (NWP). The European Meteorological Aircraft Derived Data Centre (EMADDC) system processes aircraft surveillance data received from air traffic control (ATC) and other partners and converts them into upper-air observations of wind and temperature. Only so-called Mode-S Enhanced Surveillance (Mode-S EHS) data can be used because these data contain the air vector and ground vector of the aircraft from which a wind vector can be inferred. Temperature is derived from true airspeed and Mach number measurements. To produce high-quality observations, the data are processed in three steps: pre-processing, processing, and post-processing. The pre-processing is needed to obtain high-quality information and to calculate several correction values for correcting temperature observations and heading values. Processing converts the aircraft data into meteorological information, and finally post-processing guarantees that only high-quality information is made available.The EMADDC system processes around 75×106 surveillance observations per day and produces over 55×106 observations of quality-controlled wind observations and 32×106 temperature observations in the European airspace per day. The average age of the observation is around 5 to 10 min, depending on the method of data delivery (files via ftp or streaming constantly).The quality of the observations produced is verified by comparing these observation to other upper-air wind and temperature observations from radiosondes and Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) and comparing them with NWP data. The quality of wind observations is almost identical to AMDAR, and the quality of the temperature of EMADDC observations is lower but with a bias of around zero, while AMDAR exhibits a positive bias of 0.5 K.This paper presents the EMADDC (R2.2) system, operational since 2019."

We provide a reproducible code base that can be used to easily update the product for future years. 
 While there are many global geospatial datasets representing the extent of agriculture, they predominantly represent croplands. Only a couple of global data products represent the full global agricultural footprint, including both cropland and pastures. Our own research team's most recent complete publicly available agricultural land cover dataset, including both croplands, and pastures, represents circa 2000.

 Denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) convert reactive nitrogen to inert N2 and play vital roles in nitrogen removal in coastal and marine ecosystems, weakening the adverse effects caused by terrestrial excessive nitrogen inputs. Given the importance of denitrification and anammox in the nitrogen cycle, several studies have measured denitrification and anammox through intact core incubations across different systems, and nitrogen loss processes are affected by a series of environmental factors such as organic carbon, nitrate, dissolved oxygen and temperature. However, a global synthesis of actual nitrogen loss rates is lacking, and how environmental factors regulate nitrogen loss remains unclear. Therefore, we have compiled a database of nitrogen loss rates, including denitrification and anammox in coastal and marine systems, from the published literature. This database includes 473, 466 and 255 measurements for total nitrogen loss, denitrification and anammox, respectively. This work deepens our understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of denitrification, anammox and the relative contribution of anammox to total nitrogen loss, and their corresponding environmental controls. To our knowledge, the constructed database offers for the first time a comprehensive overview of actual nitrogen loss rates in coastal and marine ecosystems on a global scale. This database can be utilized to compare nitrogen loss rates of different regions, identify the key factors regulating these rates and parameterize biogeochemical models in the future.

Due to its wide spectral range and polarimetric capabilities, POSP measurements provide rich information for aerosol and surface characterization. We present the detailed aerosol/surface products generated from POSP's first 18 months of operation, including spectral aerosol optical depth, aerosol-size-/absorption-related properties, surface black-sky and white-sky albedos, etc. 
 The development of long-term, continuous, consistent, and high-quality satellite remote sensing aerosol and surface products is crucial to constrain climate models and improve our understanding of climate change. Particulate Observing Scanning Polarization (POSP) is the first space-borne multi-spectral (UV–VIS–NIR–SWIR) cross-track scanning polarimeter dedicated to complementing the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) multi-angle polarimetric measurements and performing synergistic observations, namely the polarization crossfire (PCF) suite on board the Chinese GF-5(02) (Gaofen-5 series) satellite. The POSP's unique single-view spectral (UV–VIS–NIR–SWIR) high-precision polarimetric measurements provide rich information for atmospheric aerosol and surface characterization. Here, we developed aerosol and surface products from POSP/GF-5(02) based on the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP)/Models approach. The detailed retrieval approach and processing scheme are provided. The baseline Level 2 product was generated for the first 18 months of POSP measurements from December 2021 to May 2023 and is publicly available and registered at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.14748 (Chen et al., 2024c). The obtained POSP/GF-5(02) aerosol and surface products are validated and intercompared with the ground-based AERONET reference aerosol dataset and other independent satellite products, such as the NOAA-20 VIIRS/DB aerosol product and the MODIS MCD43 surface product. The results show generally good consistency of POSP products with AERONET, the VIIRS/NOAA-20 aerosol dataset, and the MODIS surface product. Moreover, the developed POSP product includes not only total aerosol optical depth (AOD) but also detailed properties of aerosols (aerosol size, absorption, layer height, type, etc.), along with full-surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), bidirectional polarization distribution function (BPDF), black-sky albedo, white-sky albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). These parameters are of high importance to constrain the Earth–atmosphere radiation budget. The retrieval of these properties seems to be possible due to the polarimetric capabilities and wide UV–VIS–NIR–SWIR spectral range of POSP observations and advances of the used GRASP/Models retrieval approach. Finally, some potential improvements for the POSP Level 1–Level 2 processing chain are identified, and the limitations and lessons learned are discussed."

Macfarlane;Duncan A. Robertson,SynRad v1.0: a radar forward operator to simulate synthetic weather radar observations from volcanic ash clouds,"A numerical model that simulates the measurement processes behind the ground-based radars used to detect volcanic ash clouds is introduced. Using weather radars to detect volcanic clouds is not ideal, as fine ash particles are smaller than raindrops and remain undetected. We evaluate the performance of weather radars to study ash clouds and to identify optimal frequencies that balance the trade-off between a higher return signal and the higher path attenuation that comes at these higher frequencies. 
 In this work, SynRad, a new radar forward operator for the Active Tracer High-Resolution Atmospheric Model (ATHAM) volcanic plume model is introduced. The operator is designed  to generate synthetic radar signals from ground-based scanning weather radars for volcanic ash clouds simulated by ATHAM. A key novelty of SynRad is a ray-tracing module that traces radar beams from the antenna to the ash cloud and calculates path attenuation due to hydrometeors and ash. The operator is designed to be compatible with the one-moment microphysics scheme in ATHAM, but it can easily be extended to  other one- or two-moment schemes in ATHAM or any weather prediction model. The operator can be used to test candidate locations at which to operationally deploy portable high-frequency or multi-frequency (from long to short wavelength) scanning radar(s). An optimal frequency or frequencies (for a multi-frequency radar) can be identified that balance the trade-off between a stronger return signal and the increased path attenuation that comes at these higher frequencies. A case study of the eruption of the Raikoke volcano in 2019 is used to evaluate the performance of SynRad. The measurement process of a C-band radar is simulated using SynRad, and the operator was able to generate realistic fields of the equivalent radar reflectivities, echo tops, and vertical maximum intensities. Even though higher-frequency microwave weather radars (K-band and higher) have been used to observe volcanic activity, they may not operate in scanning mode. Ideally, higher-frequency microwave radars will be designed and constructed specifically for monitoring volcanic eruptions. This is certainly possible in the coming years, making feasibility studies on the capability of higher-frequency radars timely."

These models are useful for studying the composition of the Earth's and other planets' atmospheres. Understanding the results of these models can be difficult. Here, we build on previous work to develop open-source code that can identify the reaction chains (pathways) that produce the results of these models, facilitating the understanding of these results. 
 We describe the development of Chempath, an open-source pathway analysis program for photochemical models.  This algorithm can help understand the results of complex photochemical models by identifying the most important reaction chains (pathways) for the production and destruction of a species of interest in a reaction system. The algorithm can also quantify the contributions of the pathways to the production and destruction of a species. Chempath is an open-source Python re-implementation of the algorithm developed by Lehmann (2004). However, Chempath does not include the balance of concentration changes and reaction rates that Lehmann's algorithm uses to eliminate imbalances due to numerical errors. Instead, Chempath quantifies the contributions of these imbalances to the production and destruction of a species.We demonstrate how to apply Chempath to both a simple box model and a one-dimensional photochemical model, using a reaction system for Earth's present-day atmosphere. Chempath can identify well-known chemical mechanisms for O3 production and destruction in these models, suggesting that this algorithm can be applied to understand photochemical models of less-well-known atmospheres, like past and exoplanet atmospheres."

 The first version of the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP v1.0) coordinated key simulations exploring the role of individual forcings in past, current and future climate as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 6 (CMIP6). The simulations have been used extensively in the literature for detection and attribution of long-term changes, constraining projections of climate change, attributing extreme events and understanding drivers of past and future simulated climate changes. Attribution studies using DAMIP v1.0 simulations underpinned prominent assessments of human-induced warming in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report. Here, we describe the set of DAMIP v2.0 simulations, proposed for the next phase of CMIP, CMIP7. Detection and attribution studies rely on pre-industrial control simulations and historical simulations, which will be part of the Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) set of simulations for CMIP7. In addition, we identify the three highest-priority single-forcing experiments for CMIP7 to be run as “Assessment Fast Track” simulations in support of the Seventh Assessment Report of the IPCC: simulations with natural forcings only, anthropogenic well-mixed greenhouse gases only and anthropogenic aerosols only. Beyond this, the DAMIP v2.0 experimental design includes full-column ozone-only simulations and land-use-only simulations, such that the set of individual forcing experiments, when these are considered together, represents the full set of historical forcings. While concentration-driven simulations are prioritised for attribution, emissions-driven versions of the DAMIP experiments are also proposed to support understanding of the influence of carbon-cycle feedbacks on the simulated responses to individual forcings."

This study evaluates techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of seven alternative unblended fuels for freight locomotive engines─biodiesel, renewable diesel (RD), bio-oils, methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), ethanol, and ammonia─across 16 fuel pathways utilizing soybean, corn, woody biomass, renewable hydrogen, and waste sources, e.g., sludge, manure, and industrial CO2, and compares these to conventional diesel. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) ranged from $2.05 to $8.27 per diesel gallon equivalent (2020 US dollars), with biocrude and RDs produced from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of sludge having the lowest MFSPs due to coproduct credits and avoided waste treatment cost. Life cycle GHG emissions ranged from −41 to 53 g of CO2e/MJ. RD from waste via HTL achieves negative emissions by diverting sludge/manure from GHG-intensive conventional management. Few pathways such as biocrude, methanol, and DME require additional control for SOX emissions in the refinery, while ethanol, FT-diesel, and bio-oil require additional control for particulate matter emissions. Bio-oil and RD from sludge have lower marginal abatement cost or MAC (–$38/tonne CO2 lowest) while methanol and ammonia with renewable hydrogen have higher MAC ($490/tonne CO2 maximum)."

In this study, we investigated the toxicokinetics of Tl in the intertidal snail Reishia clavigera, an ecologically and economically important gastropod native to East and Southeast Asia. Using the stable isotope 203Tl as a tracer, we quantified Tl uptake and elimination under environmentally relevant conditions across salinity (15–30‰) and temperature (7–28 °C) gradients. Despite moderate uptake rates (ku: 0.064–0.29 L g–1 day–1), Tl bioaccumulation remained low due to exceptionally fast elimination (ke: 0.79–3.37 day–1), with biological half-lives as short as 0.21 days. Salinity suppressed Tl uptake without affecting elimination, while temperature increased both ku and ke. The resulting bioconcentration factors (BCF: 59–160 L kg–1 dry weight) were two to four orders of magnitude lower than those of other trace metals, indicating inherently weak Tl retention. Tissue-specific analyses showed a higher Tl retention in viscera than in muscle, largely driven by slower elimination. Our findings resolve the apparent paradox between Tl’s high mammalian toxicity and relatively lower aquatic toxicity, highlighting rapid elimination as the key controlling factor. This work underscores the importance of integrating toxicokinetics into ecological risk assessment and suggests that Tl tissue levels in marine mollusks primarily reflect short-term environmental exposure rather than chronic contamination."

Herein, a polypyrrole (PPy) nanostructured coating strategy was proposed to modify PCs (PPy@P-BC) for rapid and efficient removal of ultrashort- and short-chain PFAS from water. Static batch tests revealed that the sorption rate constant and sorption capacity of PFAS (C2–C6) on PPy@P-BC are at least 38 times and 5 times greater than those on undecorated PCs and benchmark materials of granular activated carbon, respectively, and their sorption equilibrium time is within 300 s. The outstanding sorption performance of PPy@P-BC is maintained in dynamic column tests (>3120 bed volumes) and different types of real water contaminated by 36 PFAS, including 11 previously identified emerging PFAS (removal >95.3%). PPy@P-BC also exhibited excellent regeneration and reusability. The following dual-drive mechanisms for PFAS removal were identified based on experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations: (i) electrostatic attraction between amino functional groups (especially −NH•+−) on the nanostructured PPy coating and anionic PFAS and (ii) pore filling facilitated by the well-preserved porous structure via construction of the nanostructured coating. Overall, these results provide a promising solution to address the ultrashort- and short-chain PFAS crisis."

Tested products were sourced from multiple markets, including North America, South America and Europe, all of which had at least one item with levels consistent with intentional fluorination. The observation of at least one product in each tested category not containing intentional fluorine indicates that PFAS use is unnecessary in all these reusable products.

The products of α-pinene ozonolysis measured experimentally are typically characterized by only their molecular formulas, while their structures and formation mechanisms often remain unclear. In this work, we theoretically map the oxidation pathways, structures, and formation time scales of the major first-generation products formed from α-pinene ozonolysis by calculating the H-shift and bond-scission reaction rate coefficients of the peroxy (RO2) and alkoxy (RO) radicals that arise under atmospheric conditions with different RO2 bimolecular reaction rates (kbi): polluted (kbi > 0.2 s–1), moderate (0.2 s–1 > kbi > 0.01 s–1), and pristine (kbi ≈ 0.01 s–1). In polluted environments, almost no RO2 unimolecular reactions are of importance and ozonolysis leads to nitrates and small fragmented products. By contrast, in moderate to pristine atmospheres, C10 highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) with up to 12 oxygen atoms can form from either purely unimolecular or a combination of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Our results suggest that explicit chemical mechanisms of α-pinene ozonolysis used ubiquitously in the literature require significant revision in their treatment of unimolecular-isomerization and stereoisomer-specific reactions."

Using satellite isoprene retrievals from the Cross‐track infrared sounder (CrIS), we find anomalously high isoprene columns during 2020, coincident with high methane growth. Isoprene's oxidation produces carbon monoxide, which can be transported over longer distances and decrease OH outside of isoprene source regions. Elevated isoprene concentrations may have contributed 13% (bounds: 10%–28%) of 2020's methane growth if we assume no change in NOx emissions in 2020.

Ensemble members with strongest MJO precipitation change in a given 20‐year period have a more El Niño‐like east Pacific warming pattern.

We show that high resolution (∼10 km2) TEMPO measurements can be used to produce good quality SO2 retrievals with relatively small noise and biases. We demonstrate that hourly TEMPO data are useful for monitoring volcanic hazards, by providing frequent updates on the plume location and additional information on the plume height or winds. With the large number of measurements from TEMPO, it is also feasible to monitor diurnal changes in SO2 for relatively large sources such as the Cantarell oil field. We also show that high‐cadence TEMPO measurements allow estimates of SO2 degassing from Popocatépetl volcano on sub‐daily timescales. Overall, our results suggest that TEMPO can significantly enhance space‐based SO2 detection and monitoring over North America."

The nighttime maritime low cloud extent is often determined in meteorological satellite imagery using the brightness‐temperature difference between the longwave infrared (e.g., 11 μm) and shortwave infrared (e.g., 3.9 μm) window bands. However, this nighttime low‐cloud detection has been previously shown to be contaminated by clear‐sky false low cloud (FLC) signals associated with warm and moist air over cold regions of water. We use numerical model data and radiative transfer to quantitatively estimate the global extent and intensity of FLC signals. Insights from this research can help forecasters and researchers determine which regions and conditions are prone to nighttime FLCs and thus may require either refinement of detection algorithms or independent sensor assessments."

However, photolysis‐driven postdepositional processing can alter ice core nitrate signals and complicate their interpretation. We present a new nitrogen isotope (δ15N) record of nitrate measured in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core covering the last glacial period and Holocene. The glacial δ15N(NO3−) is substantially higher than the Holocene δ15N(NO3−), with a glacial‐interglacial difference of (26.6 ± 5.7) ‰. All samples exhibit a strong negative correlation between δ15N(NO3−) and the snow accumulation rate, suggesting that postdepositional processing is the primary driver of the δ15N(NO3−) variability. Photochemical model calculations indicate that changes in the degree of postdepositional processing can fully explain the observed glacial‐interglacial δ15N(NO3−) difference, with 12.7% and 31.8% of nitrate mass loss during the Holocene and glacial climate, respectively. Comparison with the Greenland GISP2 δ15N(NO3−) record indicates that the glacial level of postdepositional modification was higher at WAIS Divide despite its snow accumulation rate was twice that at Summit, Greenland. This is due to the higher light‐absorbing impurity contents in the GISP2 ice core that reduced postdepositional losses. We also assess the ability of using δ15N(NO3−) for past surface mass balance (SMB) reconstruction at WAIS Divide. We find this proxy is reliable for regions/periods with snow accumulation rates lower than 150 kg m−2 a−1. While exceeding this threshold, the assumption of a constant δ15N of initially deposited nitrate is no longer valid, leading to significant bias in SMB reconstruction such as WAIS Divide."

Here, we use an isotope‐enabled climate model with water‐tagging capability to show that the developing and decaying phases of ENSO are associated with distinct patterns of interannual δ18Op variability in the northern and southern TP. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we conducted modeling experiments to investigate three potential processes through which ENSO may affect the interannual variation of δ18Op in the TP, including (a) the initial vapor isotopic signal in the ocean sources, (b) the relative moisture contribution from different sources, and (c) atmospheric processes along the moisture transport path. We find that δ18Op is dominantly influenced by upstream processes along the moisture transport, in response to ENSO‐driven changes in atmospheric activities. Specifically, during the summer and fall of the developing El Niño (La Niña) phases, δ18Op in the southern TP is affected by convective activities in the Indian Peninsula, Bay of Bengal, Indochina Peninsula, and South China Sea, leading to enrichment (depletion) in δ18Op. In contrast, atmospheric activities over the Eurasian landmass and the local TP during the mature winter and the decaying spring phases of El Niño (La Niña) result in depletion (enrichment) of δ18Op in the northern TP. Our study suggests the possibility of improving the reconstruction of past ENSO‐related interannual variations at a seasonal scale by integrating isotopic proxies from TP."

However, it is not yet fully understood how different permafrost types constrain TWS changes during the rapid warming period. In this study, we focused on the six major Arctic river basins (Ob', Yenisei, Lena, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie), which are characterized by widespread permafrost, and employed three TWS products derived from remote sensing observations, land surface models, and reanalysis data sets to quantify changes in TWS anomalies during the rapid warming period (1981–2020). Statistical analyses revealed differential TWS declines across all permafrost types, with the most significant decline observed in the discontinuous permafrost regions at −3.05 mm/year, compared to in the continuous permafrost regions (−0.78 mm/year) and in the sporadic permafrost regions (−2.45 mm/year). Correlation analyses further indicated a pronounced negative relationship between permafrost active layer thickness (ALT) and TWS, especially in discontinuous permafrost regions, where a 1‐cm increase in ALT corresponded to a TWS decrease of up to 4.4‐mm. These findings highlight the significant impact of permafrost thawing accelerated by climate warming on TWS changes in permafrost‐dominated Arctic regions, with important implications for regional hydrology, carbon feedback, and ecosystem stability in the pan‐Arctic. Our results underscore the necessity of incorporating permafrost‐specific processes into hydrological models and climate assessments, thereby enhancing projections of water resource a4vailability and environmental changes in northern high‐latitude regions."

This study employed environmental covariates representing climate, soil, and vegetation, combined with a hybrid convolutional neural network ‐ Long Short‐term Memory‐self‐attention (CNN‐LSTM‐SA) model to predict net primary productivity (NPP) of the Northeast China (NEC) and the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) Mollisol regions. The analysis covered the periods from 2001 to 2020, and 2021 to 2040 under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP245 and SSP585. Subsequently, areas requiring crop type adjustments were identified, and appropriate crops were assigned to each growth site. Our results elucidate that: (a) During 2021–2040, a general increase in temperature and minor fluctuations in precipitation were observed across the study area. In the NEC, crop NPP initially increases before decreasing, whereas in the MRB, it consistently decreases. (b) Both vegetation and soil covariates explained 75.6% of NPP variability in the NEC, while in the MRB, climate factors, particularly precipitation, accounted for 18.4% of the variability. (c) The proportion of area requiring adjustment in the NEC ranged from 4.45% to 5.13% (SSP245) to 5.05%–5.77% (SSP585), while in the MRB, it varied from 4.92% to 7.54% (SSP245) to 6.49%–9.10% (SSP585), suggesting a necessity for more substantial cropping type adjustments under the SSP585 climate scenario. (d) In the NEC, the area cultivated with corn, soybean, and other crops will decrease, while rice cultivation will increase. Conversely, a decrease in wheat and pasture, and an increase in corn and soybean cultivation are suggested in the MRB. (e) Following crop type adjustments, the average NPP enhancements for corn, soybean, rice, and other crops in unsuitable areas of the NEC were 22.85%, 22.2%, 17.35%, and 20.5%, respectively, In the MRB, the average NPP enhancements for corn, soybean, wheat, and pasture were 28.5%, 26.9%, 32.4%, and 21.1%, respectively.

 Along-trench variations in various properties of subducted slabs have been inferred in subduction zones globally, yet the causes of these variations remain poorly understood. Along the Alaska Peninsula, the variation of slab (de)hydration and fluids shallower than 50-km depth cannot explain a seismicity gap below 150 km nor the abrupt changes in volcano density and arc orientation around Aniakchak volcano. Here we investigate the cause of these observations using seismic full-wave ambient noise tomography. Our 3D shear-wave velocity model reveals multiple high-velocity slab segments below about 50 km, with a much-lower-velocity segment broadly below Aniakchak. This low-velocity segment coincides with the inferred location of a subducted oceanic plate joint, where two sets of plate fabrics intersect, and with slab-normal fast directions in the asthenosphere indicated by seismic anisotropy. We infer that the subducted oceanic joint facilitated slab weakening and tearing, which has developed into a slab window below about 150 km, explaining the seismicity gap and slab-orthogonal mantle flow. Hence we suggest that oceanic plate joints may have an important role as potential weak zones in slabs and thus potentially influence subduction dynamics and seismicity. An oceanic plate joint, where two sets of plate fabrics intersect, may have led to weakening, tearing and a window opening in the slab subducting beneath the Alaska Peninsula, according to ambient noise seismic tomography."

 The heterodifunctionalization of alkenes is an efficient and straightforward method for the preparation of highly functionalized molecules. However, enantioselective introduction of two different carbon-based functional groups in a single step using readily accessible and inexpensive starting materials presents a significant challenge. Herein, we report an electrochemical copper-catalyzed protocol for the asymmetric cyanoesterification of vinylarenes using commercially available alkyl carbazates and trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) as the sources of ester and cyano groups, respectively. The desired products could be obtained with good yields and enantioselectivities under mild conditions without the need for stoichiometric oxidants, providing sustainable access to versatile synthetic intermediates that could be smoothly converted into a variety of useful chiral building blocks. Mechanistic data are consistent with electrochemical copper-catalyzed generation of alkoxycarbonyl radicals from alkyl carbazates and the copper catalyst is also responsible for the stereoselective C–CN bond formation. The potential synthetic utility of this new electrocatalytic protocol is demonstrated in the concise synthesis of pharmacologically active molecules.

Here, authors show that DSS1 is upregulated in metastatic ccRCC, promoting tumor growth and metastasis by impairing autophagy and stabilizing TWIST1. 
 The mechanisms underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) metastasis remain largely unexplored. We demonstrate that Deleted in Split hand/Split foot protein 1 (DSS1), a critical cofactor of BRCA2 in DNA repair, is upregulated in metastatic ccRCC and promotes both tumor growth and distant metastasis. Mechanistically, DSS1 interacts with LC3 and promotes its degradation via TRIM25-mediated Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination at LC3B-K51. This impairs (macro) autophagic flux and leads to p62 accumulation, thereby stabilizing TWIST1 and facilitating its nuclear translocation, ultimately activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). DSS1 highly expressed (DSS1hi) tumor cells are enriched in late-stage tumors and are associated with microvascular invasion within a vascularized invasive niche at the tumor-stromal interface, mediated by SPP1-ITGB1 interactions. Clinically, DSS1hi tumor cells correlate with therapeutic resistance and poorer patient outcomes. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ccRCC metastasis and suggest potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.

 Cellular decision-making and tissue homeostasis are governed by transcriptional networks shaped by chromatin accessibility. Using single-nucleus multi-omics, we jointly profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 10,335 cells from the Drosophila testis apical tip. This enables inference of 147 cell type-specific enhancer-gene regulons using SCENIC + . We functionally validate key transcription factors, including ovo and klumpfuss, known from other stem cell systems but not previously linked to spermatogenesis. CRISPR-mediated knockout reveals their essential roles in germline stem cell regulation, and we provide evidence that they co-regulate shared targets through overlapping enhancer elements. We further uncover a critical role for canonical Wnt signaling, with Pangolin/Tcf activating lineage-specific targets in the germline, soma, and niche. The Pan eRegulon links Wnt activity to cell adhesion, intercellular signaling and germline stem cell maintenance. Together, our study defines the enhancer-driven regulatory landscape of early spermatogenesis and reveals conserved, combinatorial mechanisms of niche-dependent stem cell control.

 Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are key therapeutic agents in cancer immunotherapy and exert their effects through Fc receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. However, the nanoscale receptor reorganization resulting from mAb binding and its implications for the therapeutic mode of action remain poorly understood. Here, we present a multi-target 3D RESI super-resolution microscopy technique that directly visualizes the structural organization of CD20 receptors and the Type I (e.g., Rituximab) and Type II (e.g., Obinutuzumab) anti-CD20 therapeutic antibodies and quantitatively analyze these interactions at single-protein resolution in situ. We discover that, while Type I mAbs promote higher-order CD20 oligomerization, Type II mAbs induce limited clustering, leading to differences in therapeutic function. Correlating RESI with functional studies for Type II antibodies with different hinge region flexibilities, we show that the oligomeric CD20 arrangement determines the Type I or Type II function. Thus, the nanoscale characterization of CD20-mAb complexes enhances our understanding of the structure-function relationships of therapeutic antibodies and offers insights into the design of next-generation mAb therapies.

 In March 2024, clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses were first detected in U.S. dairy cattle. Similar viruses have since caused 70 zoonotic human infections. To assess changes to zoonotic potential, we characterized A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses isolated from cows’ milk and birds. Bovine-derived viruses are lethal in mice and ferrets and transmit to direct but not airborne contact ferrets. All viruses replicate in human bronchial epithelial cells despite preferentially binding avian virus-like receptors. The bovine-derived viruses remain susceptible to FDA-approved antivirals, and they are inhibited by sera from ferrets vaccinated with WHO-recommended candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) or human sera from clade 2.3.4.4c vaccinees. While 2.3.4.4b viruses induce severe disease in mammalian models, they retain many avian virus-like characteristics. Combined, we conclude that the risk of contemporary bovine-derived viruses to humans not in contact with affected animals is low. However, heightened vigilance remains essential to promptly detect and respond to any changes.

 The functional programs adopted by cancer cells and their impact on the tumor microenvironment are complex and remain unclear. Here, we identify three distinct single-cell archetypes (i.e. metabolism, stemness and inflammation) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, each exhibiting unique spatial distribution. Further analysis shows an immune-suppressive niche populated by metabolism archetype cancer cells and TREM2-positive tumor-associated macrophages (TREM2+ TAMs), which exacerbates immune exclusion and compromises patient outcomes. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the upregulated squalene epoxidase (SQLE) expression in metabolism archetype cancer cells facilitates the generation of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). OxLDL induces TREM2+ TAM polarization through the TREM2-SYK-CEBPα axis, enabling these TAMs to promote cancer cell invasion, resistance to effector cytokines and CD8+ T cell dysfunction. Importantly, cancer cell-intrinsic SQLE and TREM2+ TAMs are associated with inferior immunotherapy response in human and mouse HCC. Our results highlight an oxLDL-mediated metabolic interplay between cancer cells and TREM2+ TAMs, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for HCC immunotherapies.

 Association with reactive metal (hydr)oxides is critical for soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization. However, direct evidence is lacking on how shifting dominance of different metal-bound organic carbon within soil profile mediates SOC stability. Here we leverage a natural experiment comprising 16 soil profiles (~200 cm) sampled along a 1,500 km climatic gradient from semi-humid to semi-arid. We indicate that the response of SOC chemical stability (acid hydrolysis for recalcitrant organic carbon determination) to metal-bound organic carbon is asymmetric, meaning that metal-bound organic carbon dominating recalcitrant organic carbon does not strictly follow the pattern of greater content equating to stronger effect. Soil pH mediates the shift in dominance from iron to calcium phases over the range of 7.2 to 7.6, thereby regulating their respective impact on recalcitrant organic carbon. Our findings elucidate the key behavior of metal-bound organic carbon (especially calcium-bound organic carbon), in maintaining SOC stability under soil pH regulation. Metal-bound organic carbon dominating soil organic carbon stability does not follow the pattern of greater content equating to stronger effect, rather it is strongly regulated by soil pH, according to an experiment with 16 soil profiles spanning 1500 km in northern China."

 Over 130 million people in Latin America identify as Afro-descendants, many of whom inhabit lands with potential to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change. Yet, the role of Afro-descendants is not adequately considered in conservation and climate decision-making. Here, we mapped the biological value of Afro-descendant lands in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Suriname, and conducted a matching analysis to estimate the effect of these lands on deforestation. Afro-descendant lands coincide with areas that have high biodiversity and irrecoverable carbon and were associated with a 29%–55% reduction in forest loss compared to control sites. To contextualize these findings, we present a social-historical assessment of Afro-descendant conservation practices. This assessment highlights the adaptation of African knowledge to the American tropics and the development of sustainable environmental practices.

 Escalating impacts of snow droughts have critically threatened hydrological stability and socioeconomic resilience on the Tibetan Plateau, Asia’s alpine water tower. However, the mechanisms linking snow droughts to compound climate extremes remain poorly understood. Here, we presented comprehensive assessment of how snow drought regimes modulated compound climate extremes during the period 1979–2022. We found significant increases in severity for both dry snow droughts and warm snow droughts, with warm types emerging as a dominant driver of snowpack depletion. Dry/warm snow droughts triggered compound dry-hot/pluvial-hot extremes through divergent heat-moisture regulation pathways: surface energy budget imbalances acted as the common trigger, while moisture heterogeneity governed the dry-wet divergence. After snow disappearance, a significant coincidence rate of 0.68 (0.58) for compound dry-hot extremes (compound pluvial-hot extremes) was observed at a 1-month lag time (p < 0.05). These findings necessitate adaptive strategies to mitigate cascading threats to water-ecosystem-socioeconomic systems in the Asian water tower.

 The 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption on Iceland’s Reykjanes Peninsula was preceded by an intense seismic swarm, offering an opportunity to investigate fluid dynamics and faulting processes at divergent plate boundary. Here we analysed 1306 full moment tensors of pre-eruption dike-related earthquakes and identified three faulting regimes: strike-slip, normal and reverse, driven by variations in vertical stress and controlled by fluid dynamics and crustal heterogeneity. Systematic volumetric components of these earthquakes revealed both tensile opening and compressive closing of cracks. Notably, crack closing dominated shallow, fractured crust, associated with surface subsidence above the dike, while crack opening occurred within the impermeable crust, suggesting overpressured fluids trapped at structural barriers. These variations highlight the role of fluid-rock interactions and anisotropic permeability in driving fault behaviour. Our results demonstrate that non-double-couple components of earthquakes are sensitive indicators of evolving stress and fluid migration. They provide insights into the mechanics of seismo-volcanic unrest at the slow-spreading rift.

 The inflow of warm waters into the Nordic Seas, crucial for sustaining the climate-regulating Atlantic overturning circulation, can be reconstructed from hydrography using a north-south dynamic height gradient across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge. Variations in this influx are herein linked to northward-propagating thermohaline anomalies, initially observed at the intergyre boundary and likely driven by changes in ocean heat transport. As these anomalies reach the eastern subpolar North Atlantic, they modulate the cross-ridge dynamic height difference, thereby influencing both the Atlantic inflow and the Nordic Seas overflows on multi-year to decadal scales. Thus, these thermohaline anomalies play a dynamically active role in modulating the watermass exchanges across the ridge and downstream along the Atlantic Water path, rather than being a simple passive train of signals. This explains why these thermohaline signals are a key source of climate predictability and provides fresh insights into the functioning of the Nordic Seas overturning circulation from observations. Northward-propagating thermohaline anomalies actively modulate Atlantic inflow into the Nordic Seas and associated overturning circulation on multi-year to decadal scales, as revealed by reconstructing inflow variations from dynamic height gradients across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge using hydrographic observations."

 Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a critical state variable for water cycle research, and the advances in satellite remote sensing technology have provided a novel means for acquiring large-scale SSM data. While satellite microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrieval has emerged as the dominant approach for global SSM product development, offering numerous advantages, it still faces significant challenges. These include the trade-off between model accuracy and generalizability, the limitations of applying uniform retrieval models across diverse environments, and the inherent complexity and computational demands of the retrieval process. To address these common issues in microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrieval studies, this study proposed a cloud-based intelligent retrieval framework for global high-accuracy SSM estimation. This framework integrated physical mechanisms with machine learning models to ensure robust generalization and high retrieval accuracy; additionally, a model selection module was incorporated to enhance the overall retrieval accuracy by providing environment-specific retrieval models. In an assessment based on global validation sites for 1-km resolution SSM retrieval, the proposed framework performed well, with an R value of 0.851 and an ubRMSE of 0.058 m3·m−3. Furthermore, to mitigate the computational resource demands and time-consuming of the retrieval process, the SSM retrieval framework was implemented in a cloud environment utilizing Google Earth Engine, Drive, and Colab, thereby enabling seamless online operation of the entire retrieval process. This cloud-based intelligent retrieval framework facilitates real-time point-scale SSM retrieval on a global scale and rapid production of high-accuracy SSM products at the regional scale (SSM products for China at 1 km resolution can be accessed via https://tinyurl.com/SSMproduct). The SSM retrieval framework can significantly contribute to agricultural, environmental, and other related fields, and serve as a reference for the retrieval of other environmental variables."

 The derivation of Diurnal Temperature Cycle (DTC) models from geostationary satellite data plays a critical role in temperature monitoring of the landscape and thermal anomaly applications such as wildfire detection. This study compares the performance of physical-based and data-driven DTC models on 1,305 study sites across Australia, leveraging Himawari-8 AHI middle-infrared (MIR) band 7 data. The physical-based model, GOT09 (based on Göttsche and Olesen study), achieved the highest accuracy, with a mean validation Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.41 K, but its practical application was limited by a lower model generation rate (48.77%), especially under high cloud cover conditions. Among data-driven methods, the proposed TRI model (named after the first author) balances accuracy and practical feasibility, achieving a validation RMSE of 3.62 K and a generation rate of 85.07%. The TRI model consistently generated reliable DTCs under various environmental conditions, including high cloud cover, outperforming alternative data-driven models such as RW (from Roberts-Wooster study), XIE (from Xie et al. study), and HAL (from Hally et al. study). Additionally, the TRI model maintained reliability across diverse land cover and climate types, showing only minimal variations in performance. The study further highlights strategies for addressing cloud and data availability challenges, proposing methods such as the use of previous day’s DTC or adjusting training data criteria in cloudy conditions. These approaches ensure a continuous temperature background where continuity of measurements is required, such as for wildfire detection. Overall, the research underscores the importance of balancing accuracy and model generation rates in DTC modeling, particularly for real-time applications. Future work could explore hybrid models and additional factors to further improve performance."

 Forest ecosystems underpin global ecological security, yet China’s forest landscapes are subjected to dual pressures of restoration and degradation, with complex spatiotemporal dynamics that remain insufficiently understood. While existing studies focus on static landscape metrics, the nonlinear interactions between natural and anthropogenic drivers of forest fragmentation and connectivity remain elusive. This study addresses this gap by introducing the Ecological Land Evolution Index (ELEI) to quantify patch-scale forest dynamics, integrating multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) with XGBoost-SHAP analysis to dissect driving mechanisms across China from 2000 to 2020. Key findings reveal distinct spatial patterns: Ecological Land Restoration (ELR) processes with high connectivity potential concentrated in northeastern China, the Qinba Mountains, and southwestern regions. “Connection-type” patches (comprising 48 % of ELR area) dominated low-elevation plains (e.g., Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau), while “infilling-type” restoration prevailed in hilly/mountainous areas, driven by shrubland-to-forest conversions. Ecological Land Degradation (ELD) driven by cropland expansion caused severe fragmentation in the Sichuan Basin and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.”Enclosing-type” ELD dominated high-relief mountains, while “fragmentation-type” patches thrived in lowlands under agricultural/urban pressures. MGWR analysis identified slope, elevation, and the Grain for Green Program as key positive drivers of ELR connectivity, while urbanization and agricultural expansion emerged as dominant ELD fragmentation forces with pronounced spatial heterogeneity. XGBoost-SHAP further revealed nonlinear interactions: road density (>0.5 km/km2) exacerbating fragmentation in depopulating peri-urban zones, and climate-topography thresholds shaping restoration efficacy (e.g., precipitation > 1,300 mm). This national-scale assessment highlights the need for connectivity-oriented strategies: prioritize contiguous forest expansion in plains, promote infilling-type restoration in hills/mountains, and facilitate passive recovery in high-altitude regions. By quantifying patch-scale connectivity changes and disentangling complex driver interactions, the study provides a scientific foundation for adaptive forest management, bridging ecological conservation and socioeconomic development."

 The air quality in major cities has declined due to increasing urbanization and industrialization, resulting in serious health and crucial economic impacts. The presence of particulate matter in the atmosphere, specifically PM2.5 (fine) and PM10 (fine and coarse), creates a substantial threat to human health. Prediction of PM concentration levels using machine learning (ML) might help the government to prepare a better prevention and safety plan that can eventually lower the risk factor. The present study is based on predicting the PM concentration in Delhi–NCR (western Uttar Pradesh) by developing a ML model for PM2.5 and PM10 under different atmospheric conditions, including precipitation, wind speed, temperature, specific humidity, relative humidity, and surface pressure. We have developed a prediction model for two observational stations: the first industrial area (station 1) and the second urban area (station 2). The analysis of particulate matter indicates that seasonal fluctuation significantly influences air pollution levels in industrial areas. It was observed that 90 days of particulate matter concentration exceeded the permissible threshold established by NAAQS (PM2.5 = 60 μg/m3) during the winter season in 2020 and 61 days during the post-monsoon season in 2021. Meteorological parameters, such as temperature inversions and stagnant wind conditions, significantly contribute to pollutant accumulation, especially during the winter and post-monsoon seasons. The Neural Network and Random Forest models outperformed compared to other ML models, achieving R2 values of 0.74 for PM2.5 at station 1 and 0.84 for PM10 at station 2, indicating enhanced precision in explaining non-linear correlations between meteorological parameters and pollutant concentrations. According to the study and predictions, these innovative methods may improve the accuracy of particulate matter prediction and impact policymakers and decision-makers within pollution control agencies to improve air quality."

 Aerosols substantially influence microphysical processes within thunderclouds, potentially altering lightning flash rates and electrical characteristics. This research analyzed Cloud-to-Ground (CG) lightning data from the Indian Lightning Location Network (ILLN) for Maharashtra state (Western India) over the period 2014–2023. The seasonal proportion of positive CG lightning events and the underlying mechanisms contributing to their increased frequency have been investigated. The analysis revealed that the percentage of positive CG lightning peaked at approximately 40 % during the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) season and the post-monsoon period. These peaks coincided with elevated dust aerosol concentrations in the study area, which were associated with long-range transport of dust aerosols from the Arabian Desert and adjoining areas during the ISM. The high humidity during this period leads to a lower estimated cloud base height compared to the pre-monsoon season, likely facilitating the influx of abundant dust aerosols into thunderclouds. These dust particles act as efficient ice nuclei (IN), alter cloud microphysics, and enhance charge separation processes within thunderclouds. Positive CG lightning showed a significant upward trend, increasing by 141 % (2.41-fold rise) from 2014 to 2023, with an average annual rise of 4312 flashes during the ISM. Additionally, an increasing trend in Dust Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) and Ice Cloud Optical Thickness (ICOT) during the ISM emphasized the potential link between desert dust influx and the rise in positive CG lightning activity, suggesting a role for dust particles in ice formation within thunderclouds. The correlation between ICOT and positive CG lightning further confirmed that increased dust concentrations likely contributed to the rise in positive CG lightning activity. We propose that elevated dust concentrations near the cloud base promote ice crystal accumulation, fostering the development of a positive charge region in the lower portion of the mixed-phase region through a non-inductive charging mechanism. This environment likely contributes to the formation of tripole thunderclouds, characterized by a distinct lower positive charge region, commonly referred to as Inverted Polarity thunderclouds."

 Supermicron sea spray aerosols (SSA) play a crucial role in stratocumulus cloud microphysics and drizzle formation. However, our understanding of SSA's spatiotemporal distribution, production mechanisms, and fluxes in the marine boundary layer remains limited. This study introduces a novel approach to determine supermicron SSA production flux and number concentration at various heights above the ocean surface. Our method leverages Doppler lidar data, specifically attenuated backscatter and vertical velocity, collected at a 105 m range gate during the Eastern Pacific Clouds and Aerosols for Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) at Scripps Pier, La Jolla, California. To focus on nascent SSA, we analyzed data from periods with wind directions between 225° and 315° and wind speeds exceeding 4 m s−1. Cloud and precipitation events were excluded using relative humidity, backscatter thresholds, and 2D Video Disdrometer observations. Results show that calculated supermicron SSA number concentrations at 105 m ranged from 0.26 to 2.93 cm−3 for surface wind speeds between 4 and 6 ms−1. When exceeding the method's Limit of Detection, estimated production fluxes ranged from 0.20 to 1.53 cm−2 s−1.

 Global industrialization and urbanization have caused substantial emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial environments. Nitrous acid (HONO), a significant Nr species, exhibits a short lifetime yet has a strong environmental oxidation capacity. Atmospheric HONO production is primarily attributed to homogeneous or heterogeneous reactions of NOx and heterogeneous particulate nitrate reactions. Integrated observational and modeling studies demonstrate that atmospheric HONO critically modulates tropospheric ozone production and overall oxidation capacity through photolysis and reoxidation. The atmosphere-soil HONO exchange is mainly mediated by deposition and microbial activity. HONO cycling across atmosphere-soil boundaries perturbs soil acid-base balance and gas-liquid partitioning, thereby modifying physicochemical properties of soil and restructuring microbial community composition. Photolysis of NOx and particulate nitrate is the main source of HONO formation at the ocean-atmosphere interface, while heterogeneous reactions of NOx with nitrate particles are key processes in marine HONO formation. The sea surface microlayer inhibits HONO dissociation, which may affect its environmental persistence and interactions. Ocean acidification and oxidation-capacity changes are possible consequences of the mutual conversion of HONO in atmosphere-ocean environments. Future studies should elucidate heterogeneous transformation pathways and cross-media migration dynamics of HONO, and quantify its environmental-health impacts."

 High levels of ozone (O₃) and particulate matter (PM) have become significant environmental challenges in urban areas worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as China. A comprehensive understanding of atmospheric chemistry during both polluted and non-polluted periods is essential for effective pollution control strategies. In this study, we analyzed reactive atmospheric gases (VOCs, NOₓ, and O₃) in Nanjing, China, during high and low O₃ and PM₂.₅ episodes. The Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM) was employed to simulate OH reactivity, the ROx radical budget, ROx radical chemistry, and O₃-related processes. We found that the contribution of model-derived secondary reactants and unconstrained primary hydrocarbons to total OH reactivity was significantly higher during high ozone episodes (HOE) at 50.5 %, compared to 38.8 % during low ozone episodes (LOE). Aromatic compounds contributed more to OH reactivity during high PM₂.₅ episodes (HPME, 20 %) than during low PM₂.₅ episodes (LPME, 14.5 %). The ROx radical recycling rates were approximately 2.5 to 7.5 times higher than primary production rates during HOE, compared to LOE. Additionally, the RO₂ + NO reaction accounted for a larger share of daily mean O₃ production during HOE (50 %) than during LOE (46 %). Conversely, O₃ photolysis contributed more to daily mean O₃ loss during LOE (37 %) than during HOE (33 %). Finally, a Random Forest model revealed that meteorological and atmospheric chemical conditions together enhanced ozone formation by approximately 63 % (other parts could be explained by the concentrations of precursors). This study sheds light on how various atmospheric conditions and pollutants interact to form secondary pollution, offering valuable insights for more effective pollution control strategies."
