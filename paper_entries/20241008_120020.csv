10.1088/1748-9326/ad71e1,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究欧洲在 2050 年实现碳中和的路径，重点关注各种陆地和技术二氧化碳去除 (CDR) 策略，包括森林恢复、土壤碳封存、生物能源与碳捕获与封存、直接空气捕获与封存、生物炭和增强风化等负排放技术和实践 (NETPs)。论文通过三个情景故事来描述 NETPs 在不同未来发展中的作用，并分析了大规模实施 NETPs 的潜在机遇和限制。研究结果表明，到 2050 年，欧洲实现碳中和可能需要数百万吨的 NETPs。论文还强调了 NETPs 在提供实现气候目标的成本效益解决方案方面的潜力，但同时也指出需要更严格的温室气体减排政策，以避免过度依赖 CDR。,"['carbon dioxide removal', 'carbon neutrality', 'negative emissions', 'bioenergy with carbon capture and storage', 'direct air capture and storage']",Johanna Markkanen;Kati Koponen;Antti Lehtilä,Sustainable negative emissions in Europe: evaluating scenarios to meet carbon neutrality by 2050,"Using the Pan-European TIMES-VTT model, we studied pathways for carbon neutrality by 2050 for 31 European countries by modelling a large portfolio of various terrestrial and technological carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies. Negative emission technologies and practices (NETPs) such as af-/reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture and storage, biochar, and enhanced weathering were considered. Three different storylines were created to describe the role of NETPs in varying future developments. The scenario storylines illustrate potential opportunities and constraints for large scale NETP implementation focusing on (1) optimistic technology development, (2) strict protection of planetary boundaries, and (3) increased self-sufficiency due to geopolitical risks associated with policy fragmentation. The results show that the demand for NETPs could be on a gigaton scale to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050. As different countries have different opportunities to implement NETPs, none of the NETP options should be excluded from mitigation portfolios at this stage. The results also indicate the potential of NETPs in providing cost-effective solutions for achieving climate targets. On the other hand, stricter greenhouse gas emission reduction policies are needed to avoid over-reliance on CDR."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7479,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是碳移除技术（CDR）的研究进展及其在科学、技术、政策和媒体领域的传播情况。它利用文献计量方法分析了八种不同碳移除解决方案的科学进展，并探讨了这些进展对科学研究、技术创新、政策制定和公众讨论的影响。论文的重点在于分析不同CDR技术的社会价值和传播效应，并没有直接涉及到大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。,"['carbon dioxide removal', 'CDR', 'Direct Air Capture', 'Blue Carbon', 'Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage']",Giorgio Tripodi;Fabrizio Lillo;Roberto Mavilia;Andrea Mina;Francesca Chiaromonte;Francesco Lamperti,The public use of early-stage scientific advances in carbon dioxide removal: a science-technology-policy-media perspective,"While Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) solutions are considered essential to meet Paris Agreement objectives and curb climate change, their maturity and current ability to operate at scale are highly debated. The rapid development, deployment, and diffusion of such methods will likely require the coordination of science, technology, policy, and societal support. This article proposes a bibliometric approach to quantify the public use of early-stage research in CDR. Specifically, we employ generalized linear models to estimate the likelihood that scientific advances in eight different carbon removal solutions may induce (i) further production of scientific knowledge, (ii) technological innovation, and (iii) policy and media discussion. Our main result is that research in CDR is of significant social value. CDR research generates significant, positive, yet heterogeneous spillovers within science and from science to technology, policy, and media. In particular, advances in Direct Air Capture spur further research and tend to result in patentable technologies, while Blue Carbon and Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage appear to gain relative momentum in the policy and public debate. Moreover, scientific production and collaborations cluster geographically by type of CDR, potentially affecting long-term carbon removal strategies. Overall, our results suggest the existence of coordination gaps between science, technology, policy, and public support."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7747,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注了洛杉矶和长滩港口在新冠疫情期间由于货运量激增导致的空气污染和温室气体排放问题。研究人员通过对船舶、卡车、火车和港口设备的排放进行评估，发现疫情期间的拥堵导致了氮氧化物和二氧化碳等污染物的排放量大幅增加。研究还分析了加州空气资源委员会的清洁能源政策对未来港口排放的影响，并预测了未来十年内排放量的变化趋势。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测和卫星观测等领域。,"['air quality monitoring', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'particulate matter', 'oxides of nitrogen', 'carbon dioxide', 'satellite observations']",Jiachen Zhang;Junhyeong Park;Nancy Bui;Sara Forestieri;Elizabeth Mazmanian;Yucheng He;Cory Parmer;David C Quiros,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on greenhouse gas and criteria air pollutant emissions from the San Pedro Bay Ports and future policy implications,"The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, collectively known as the San Pedro Bay Ports, serve as vital gateways for freight movement in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic and other influencing factors disrupted freight movement and led to unprecedented cargo surge, vessel congestion, and increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from seaport and connected freight system operations beginning in June 2020. In this study, we conducted the first comprehensive monthly assessment of the excess particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to the heightened congestion and freight transport activity from ocean-going vessels (OGVs), trucks, locomotives, and cargo handling equipment (CHE) supporting seaport operations. Excess emissions peaked in October 2021 at 23 tons of NOx per day and 2001 tons of CO2 per day. The strategic queuing system implemented in November 2021 significantly reduced the number of anchored and loitering OGVs and their emissions near the ports, even during continued high cargo throughput until Summer 2022. Looking forward, we analyzed projected emissions benefits of adopted California Air Resources Board regulations requiring cleaner and zero-emission trucks, locomotives, and CHE over the next decade. If a repeated port congestion event were to occur in 2035, NOx emissions from land-based freight transport should be lessened by more than 80%. Our study underscores the potential emissions impacts of disruptions to the freight transport network and the critical need to continue reducing its emissions in California and beyond."

This study examines Mexico City’s Cosecha de Lluvia program, a government initiative promoting residential rainwater harvesting (RWH). This case study offers valuable lessons for other megacities facing similar water security issues. The study particularly explores result-based financing (RBF) as a promising strategy to strengthen Mexico City’s RWH sector. Despite its potential, research on RBF for water supply diversification remains limited, especially from the perspective of practitioners. To address this gap, the study employs a systems thinking approach supported by qualitative methods, including a literature review and interviews. Thematic networks analysis revealed that RBF could enhance Cosecha de Lluvia by improving monitoring and results measurement, facilitating information exchange, and increasing transparency—key factors for successful water supply diversification. While these identified benefits do not address all of Cosecha de Lluvia’s challenges and RBF could have implementation challenges, there is a clear opportunity for this financial mechanism to enhance programs like the one studied and have a positive impact on several of its elements. As part of the RBF suitability assessment, three different funding sources were evaluated—public, private, and philanthropic—to determine their effectiveness in overcoming Cosecha de Lluvia’s challenges. The findings suggest that no single source of finance markedly influences the program’s effectiveness alone. Instead, a blended financing approach that integrates all three sources is recommended as a strategy to explore further for implementing RBF in water supply diversification efforts. Overall, the study highlights the necessity of diversifying water supply to build climate resilience in megacities. While programs like Cosecha de Lluvia are crucial, significant room for improvement exists. RBF offers a promising mechanism to enhance such initiatives, and its potential merits further exploration."

Although various studies have revealed PM2.5 chemical components, there is limited knowledge on how to reduce PM2.5 concentrations through administrative policies focusing on source management. We compared PM2.5 compositional characteristics and performed source apportionment using the positive matrix factorization in four metropolitan cities (Seoul, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Ulsan) in South Korea from 2014 to 2018. The annual average of PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the annual national ambient air quality standard of 15 μg m−3 in all areas while secondary inorganic aerosols constituted the largest fraction of PM2.5. This implies that secondary formation from gaseous precursors in the atmosphere was the main factor contributing to ambient PM2.5. However, the concentrations of PM2.5 constituents varied significantly across cities, suggesting that PM2.5 is a heterogeneous pollutant considerably influenced by region-specific conditions. In line with the chemical composition, secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate, and mobile-related sources were found to be significant contributors of PM2.5. Additionally, the extent of contribution from each source varied across the study regions. We also evaluated the impacts of policy interventions by comparing the PM2.5 composition and source apportionment before and after the policies for improving air quality. Intensive programs focused on the vehicle sector in Seoul led to a considerable decrease in the concentrations of carbonaceous compounds and mobile-related sources. In addition, strengthened regulations on coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) since 2016 have influenced the contributions of coal combustion sources in two cities adjacent to the west coastal area, where approximately half of the CFPPs of the country are densely distributed. Overall, the study’s findings indicate that region-specific PM2.5 chemical constituents and source contributions should be considered for establishing PM2.5-related policies, considering the high heterogeneity of PM2.5."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7c69,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注大气甲烷去除（AMR）技术，重点探讨在进行AMR技术野外试验之前，需要进行有意义的公众参与。论文从国际法和环境正义的核心原则出发，论证了公众参与的重要性，并以海洋施肥和太阳辐射管理为例，说明了在气候干预技术研究和开发的早期阶段，公众参与的重要性。论文还强调了早期参与如何促进道德流程和结果，并使研究与社会价值观保持一致。虽然论文没有提供实证证据证明参与总是能带来研究者期望的结果，但它认为参与总是会带来正义增进的结果，因此应该积极推动。论文倡导基于技术性质的不同参与方式，重点关注与受影响社区、公众和国际跨学科研究人员的合作。为了确保负责任的研究实践，论文呼吁制定全面的治理框架和野外试验的伦理准则。,"['atmospheric methane', 'field trials', 'environmental justice', 'public engagement', 'governance frameworks', 'ethical guidelines']",Celina Scott-Buechler;Sikina Jinnah,Early engagement will be necessary for atmospheric methane removal field trials,"Atmospheric methane removal (AMR) refers to a suite of emerging technologies and practices that destroy atmospheric methane. There is growing interest in AMR field trials to better understand the risks and benefits of various approaches. Building on rights-based rationales from international law and core principles of environmental justice, we argue that AMR field trials should not proceed before meaningful public engagement occurs. We also draw preliminary lessons from ocean fertilization and solar radiation management cases to highlight the significance of involving members of the public in conversation about climate intervention technologies in early stages of the research and development process. While we emphasize that engagement is not a checkbox for gaining social license, these cases illustrate how neglecting public engagement can be unnecessarily detrimental to proposed research. We further point to an enhanced weathering experiment to highlight how early engagement can foster ethical processes and outcomes, which enhance alignment of research with societal values. While empirical evidence does not yet support the argument that engagement always results in the outcomes researchers desire, it does always result in justice enhancing outcomes and should therefore be pursued regardless. We advocate for diverse engagement approaches based on the nature of the technology, with a focus on collaboration with impacted communities, the public, and international interdisciplinary researchers. To ensure responsible research practices, the article calls for the development of comprehensive governance frameworks and ethical guidelines for field trials."

Coastal region of Bangladesh has been struggling with elevated levels of soil and water salinity, exacerbated by storm surges and rising sea levels. We assessed nutrient and salinity contents in agricultural and homestead lands, and the level of salinity in pond and canal water in six sub-districts in coastal Bangladesh. Finally, using household (HH) survey, focus group discussion (FGD) and key informant interview (KII), we explored the adaptive practices and challenges of salinity issues in agriculture and drinking water management. Soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents exhibited significant variations across the sub-districts, which reflect the diversity of agricultural practices and soil management strategies. However, there was no notable difference in soil salinity across the sub-districts, which underscores the commonality of soil salinity as a pressing concern. Shyamnagar (13.99 dS m−1) recorded the highest level of pond water salinity, followed by Assasuni (13.96 dS m−1), Dacope (13.91 dS m−1), Koyra (13.58 dS m−1), Morrelganj (13.33 dS m−1), and Mongla (13.19 dS m−1) sub-districts, which highlights that water salinity decreased from exposed coast to the landward areas. Respondents in HH surveys, FGDs and KIIs identified salinity as a major challenge in agriculture and drinking water. Furthermore, climate-related stresses were recognized as significant challenges impacting crop productivity. The research highlights the feasibility of rainwater harvesting, with 89%–100% of HHs harvest rainwater in HH tanks, as an effective adaptive practice for managing drinking water. The study emphasizes the positive impact of vermicompost in reducing soil salinity levels, which is demonstrated by the 43%–88% of HHs using this practice, indicating its potential as a nature-based solution to address soil salinization. The findings underscore the need for resilient agricultural systems and sustainable water management approaches to tackle these challenges."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7edd,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了生物能源与碳捕获与封存技术（BECCS）在德国实现碳中和目标中的应用潜力。研究利用了一个空间详细的优化模型，考虑了BECCS的技术经济和政治因素，分析了BECCS在德国生物能源系统中的作用。研究结果表明，BECCS在2050年可以去除近6100万吨二氧化碳，但对碳信用和碳价格敏感，在一定条件下可以去除高达6900万吨二氧化碳。研究还指出，仅靠BECCS实现德国2045年碳中和目标非常困难，需要多种负排放技术共同作用。该研究为理解BECCS的可行性和其在实现德国气候目标中的潜力提供了更深入的认识。虽然该研究将模型应用于德国，但开发的工具和见解具有通用性，可以应用于其他国家。,"['bioenergy', 'carbon capture and storage', 'BECCS', 'CDR', 'CO2 removal', 'biomass', 'techno-economics', 'climate targets', 'Germany']",Mohammad Sadr;Danial Esmaeili Aliabadi;Matthias Jordan;Daniela Thrän,A bottom–up regional potential assessment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage in Germany,"Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is a bio-based Carbon Dioxide Removal Technology (CDR) undergoing detailed and comprehensive screening in many countries. The latest scientific reports emphasized that net-zero targets can not be achieved globally or nationally without deploying such technologies. Germany aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, and negative emissions thereafter, which means a higher demand for CDRs. Despite BECCS being the building block of net-zero policies, its implementation on a national and regional scale presents serious challenges. Therefore, in this study, we analyze the role of BECCS in the German bioenergy system with a spatially detailed bottom–up optimization model that accounts for techno-economics and political aspects of BECCS (e.g. availability of biomass and investment costs). Our analysis demonstrates that BECCS can remove almost 61 Mt CO2 in 2050; however, the outcomes demonstrate sensitivity toward CO2 credit and CO2 prices, which can raise the removal as high as 69 Mt CO2. Additionally, results suggest that removing enough CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality in Germany by 2045 solely through BECCS seems extremely challenging; thus, a portfolio of negative emission technologies will be necessary to contribute. Our findings provide a better understanding of BECCS feasibility and its potential to assist us in achieving climate targets in Germany. Although we apply our model to Germany, the developed tool and insights are generic and can be applied to other countries."

The FLUXNET-CH4 synthesis initiative has established a global network of flux tower infrastructure, offering valuable data products and fostering a dedicated community for the measurement and analysis of methane flux data. Existing studies using the FLUXNET-CH4 Community Product v1.0 have provided invaluable insights into the drivers of ecosystem-to-regional spatial patterns and daily-to-decadal temporal dynamics in temperate, boreal, and Arctic climate regions. However, as the wetland CH4 monitoring network grows, there is a critical knowledge gap about where new monitoring infrastructure ought to be located to improve understanding of the global wetland CH4 budget. Here we address this gap with a spatial representativeness analysis at existing and hypothetical observation sites, using 16 process-based wetland biogeochemistry models and machine learning. We find that, in addition to eddy covariance monitoring sites, existing chamber sites are important complements, especially over high latitudes and the tropics. Furthermore, expanding the current monitoring network for wetland CH4 emissions should prioritize, first, tropical and second, sub-tropical semi-arid wetland regions. Considering those new hypothetical wetland sites from tropical and semi-arid climate zones could significantly improve global estimates of wetland CH4 emissions and reduce bias by 79% (from 76 to 16 TgCH4 y−1), compared with using solely existing monitoring networks. Our study thus demonstrates an approach for long-term strategic expansion of flux observations."

However, the influence climate change and changing land use will have on these events remains unclear. A large ensemble generated using the Max-Planck Institute (MPI) Earth system model is used to generate projections of NE windstorms under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and to attribute changes to projected land use land cover (LULC) change, externally forced changes and internal climate variability. To reduce the influence of coarse grid cell resolution and uncertainties in surface roughness lengths, windstorms are identified using simultaneous widespread exceedance of local 99th percentile 10 m wind speeds (U99). Projected declines in forest cover in the NE and the resulting reductions in surface roughness length under SSP3-7.0 lead to projections of large increases in U99 and derived windstorm intensity and scale. However, these projected changes in regional LULC under SSP3-7.0 are unprecedented in a historical context and may not be realistic. After corrections are applied to remove the influence of LULC on wind speeds, regionally averaged U99 exhibit declines for most of the single model initial-condition large ensemble (SMILE) members which are broadly proportional to the radiative forcing and global air temperature increase in the SSPs, with a median value of −0.15 ms−1 °C−1. While weak cyclones are projected to decline in frequency in the NE, intense cyclones and the resulting windstorms and indices of socioeconomic loss do not. Where present, significant trends in these loss indices are positive, and some MPI SMILE members generate future windstorms that are unprecedented in the historical period."

As global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, sea levels have been consistently increasing and are projected to continue this upward trend. This study assesses the future exposure at provincial and city levels populations coastal mainland China coast to local sea level changes under five greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios from IPCC-AR6, as well as two low-confidence scenarios accounting for the potential impact of uncertain ice sheet processes with low- and high-GHG emissions. We incorporate spatial heterogeneity into regional sea level projections and population projections from 2020 to 2100, extreme sea levels (ESLs) of 10-, 50-, and 100 year return periods (RP), and local coastal protection standards. Our findings indicate that the inundated areas expand continuously within the century with heightened exposure under higher emission scenarios. Although the coastal population is projected to decline, the fraction of the coastal population exposed to flooding increases across all scenarios, with accelerated growth under higher GHG emissions and higher ESLs. Zhejiang and Jiangsu emerge as the provinces most exposed to sea-level rise, whereas Taizhou, Nantong, Wuxi, Panjin, and Huzhou are identified as the top five cities with the highest population exposure to local sea level rise (SLR). Transitioning towards a sustainable scenario (i.e. SSP1-2.6) rather than a fossil fuel-intensive one (i.e. SSP5-8.5) can reduce the local SLR and substantially mitigate these exposures. Compared to the median projections under SSP5-8.5, aligning GHG emissions with SSP1-2.6 could reduce population exposure substantially in all coastal provinces, especially in Jiangsu, where population exposure to 100 year RP coastal floods would be reduced by ∼1.6 M in 2050 and by ∼5.4 M in 2100."

Wildfire risk is closely connected to shifting climatic trends and their impacts on fuel availability and flammability. Although previous research has explored the connection between meteorological conditions and wildfire probabilities, there remains a substantial gap in understanding the influence of hydrologic drivers, such as groundwater recharge, on wildfire dynamics. Both short- and long-term variations in these variables are crucial in shaping fuel conditions, and significant changes can create environments more prone to severe wildfires. This study focuses on Santa Barbara County to examine the connection between wildfire probability and various environmental factors, including meteorological and hydrological data from 1994 to 2021, topography, vegetation, and proximity to road. Using a random forest (RF) machine learning model and fine-scale data (270 m resolution) we achieved high predictive accuracy in identifying wildfire probability. Our findings confirm the important roles of short-term meteorological conditions, such as mean precipitation 12 months and relative humidity 1 month before a wildfire event, in predicting wildfire occurrence. In addition, our results emphasize the critical contribution of long-term hydrological components, such as mean deviation from the historical normal in actual evapotranspiration and recharge in the years preceding the fire, in influencing wildfire probability. Partial dependence plots from our RF model revealed that both positive and negative deviations of these hydrological variables can increase the likelihood of wildfire by controlling fuel water availability and productivity. These findings are particularly relevant given the increasing extreme weather patterns in southern California, significantly affecting water availability and fuel conditions. This study provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between wildfire occurrence and hydrometeorological conditions. Additionally, the resulting wildfire probability map, can aid in identifying high-risk areas, contributing to enhanced mitigation planning and prevention strategies."

However, the underlying physical mechanism is still unknown completely. In this study, we explore the causative role of anomalous sea surface temperatures in three oceans using observation and reanalysis data, as well as partial regression and correlation methods. This heatwave exhibited the longest maximum duration of the past 50 years. According to the probability density function, the maximum temperature also reached an unprecedented high. A long-lived anticyclone dominated North China, causing persistent downward motion and adiabatic heating, enabling the heatwave to form and continue for more than 20 d. The Indian, Pacific, and North Atlantic oceans all experienced extreme warming. However, our results indicate that North Atlantic warming played a decisive role in the occurrence of this heatwave by exciting a Rossby wave train that propagated eastward, generating the long-lived anomalous anticyclone and inducing heatwaves. In comparison, the other two oceans exhibited weak or negative contributions to the heatwave. As the North Atlantic shows an obvious warming trend with increasing global warming, more attention should be paid to its relationship with heatwaves in North China."

 Clouds formed during marine cold-air outbreaks (MCAOs) exhibit a distinct transition from stratocumulus decks near the ice edge to broken cumuliform fields further downwind. The mechanisms associated with ice formation are believed to be crucial in driving this transition, yet the factors influencing such formation remain unclear. Through Lagrangian trajectories collocated with satellite data, this study investigates the development of mixed-phase clouds using these outbreaks. Cloud formed in MCAOs are characterized by a swift shift from liquid to ice-containing states, contrasting with non-MCAO clouds also moving off the ice edge. These mixed-phase clouds are predominantly observed at temperatures below −20 °C near the ice edge. However, further into the outbreak, they become dominant at  temperatures as high as −13 °C. This shift is consistent with the influence of biological ice-nucleating particles (INPs), which become more prevalent as the air mass ages over the ocean. The evolution of these clouds is closely linked to the history of the air mass, especially the length of time it spends over snow- and ice-covered surfaces – terrains may that be deficient in INPs. This connection also accounts for the observed seasonal variations in the development of Arctic clouds, both within and outside of MCAO events. The findings highlight the importance of understanding both local marine aerosol sources near the ice edge and the overarching INP distribution in the Arctic for modelling of cloud phase in the region."

The identification results from the bi-Gaussian method are more reasonable and more consistent with the evolution process of atmospheric thermal stratifications. 
 The tropopause is an important transition layer and can be a diagnostic of upper-tropospheric and lower-stratospheric structures, exhibiting unique atmospheric thermal and dynamic characteristics. A comprehensive understanding of the evolution of fine tropopause structures is necessary and primary for the further study of complex multi-scale atmospheric physical–chemical coupling processes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. A novel method utilizing the bi-Gaussian function is capable of identifying the characteristic parameters of vertical tropopause structures and providing information on double-tropopause (DT) structures. The new method improves the definition of the cold-point tropopause and detects one (or two) of the most significant local cold points  by fitting the temperature profiles to the bi-Gaussian function, which defines the point(s) as the tropopause height(s). The bi-Gaussian function exhibits excellent potential for explicating the variation trends of temperature profiles. The results of the bi-Gaussian method and lapse rate tropopause, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization, are compared in detail for different cases. Results indicate that the bi-Gaussian method is able to more stably and obviously identify the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the thermal tropopauses, even in the presence of multiple temperature inversion layers at higher elevations. Moreover, 5 years of historical radiosonde data from China (from 2012 to 2016) revealed that the occurrence frequency and thickness of the DT, as well as the single-tropopause height and the first and second DT heights, displayed significant meridional monotonic variations. The occurrence frequency (thickness) of the DT increased from 1.07 % (1.96 km) to 47.19 % (5.42 km) in the latitude range of 16–50° N. The meridional gradients of tropopause height were relatively large in the latitude range of 30–40° N, essentially corresponding to the climatological locations of the subtropical jet and the Tibetan Plateau."

We found that biomass burning and transboundary transport are the main sources of NOCs in the high-altitude area. Understanding these aerosol sources informs how they add to regional and potentially global climate changes. Our findings could help shape effective environmental policies to enhance air quality and address climate impacts in this sensitive region. 
 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is highly susceptible to climate change, and nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) represent one of the largest uncertainties with respect to their impact on the climate in high-altitude areas. Previous studies have shown that NOCs play a vital role in the nitrogen budget of PM2.5. However, our understanding of the composition and sources of NOCs in PM2.5, particularly in the TP, is limited. Here, we aim to enhance our understanding of NOCs in the TP region by examining their identification, concentration levels, sources, and origins. We conducted field sampling at a regional background sampling site in Gaomeigu, in the southeastern margin of the TP from 11 March to 13 May 2017, followed by laboratory analysis of the NOCs collected on the filters. The daily mass concentrations of NOCs ranged from 714.4 to 3887.1 ng m−3, with an average of 2119.4 ± 875.0 ng m−3 during the campaign. This average concentration was approximately 40 % higher than that reported at a typical regional site in the North China Plain (NCP), highlighting a more significant presence of NOCs in the Tibetan area. Biomass burning and secondary sources were identified as the major contributors to total NOCs. This was further substantiated by a regional air quality model, which indicated that over 80 % of the aerosol in the southeast of the TP originated from neighboring countries. This study improves our understanding of NOCs' contribution to PM2.5 in the TP and their potential impacts on climate stability in high-altitude areas."

Velazco;Wei Wang;Avelino F. Arellano Jr.,"Local and regional enhancements of CH4, CO, and CO2 inferred from TCCON column measurements","A combination of data analysis techniques is introduced to separate local and regional influences on observed levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane from an established ground-based remote sensing network. We take advantage of the covariations in these trace gases to identify the dominant type of sources driving these levels. Applying these methods in conjunction with existing approaches to other datasets can better address uncertainties in identifying sources and sinks. 
 In this study, we demonstrate the utility of available correlative measurements of carbon species to identify regional and local air mass characteristics as well as their associated source types. In particular, we combine different regression techniques and enhancement ratio algorithms with carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) total column abundance from 11 sites of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) to infer relative contributions of regional and local sources to each of these sites. The enhancement ratios provide a viable alternative to univariate measures of relationships between the trace gases that are insufficient in capturing source-type and transport signatures. Regional enhancements are estimated from the difference between bivariate regressions across a specific time window of observed total abundance of these species (BERr for bulk enhancement regression ratio) and inferred anomalies (AERr for anomaly enhancement regression ratio) associated with a site-specific background. Since BERr and AERr represent the bulk and local species enhancement ratio, respectively, its difference simply represents the site-specific regional component of these ratios. We can then compare these enhancements for CO2 and CH4 with CO to differentiate between combustion and non-combustion air masses. Our results show that while the regional and local influences in enhancements vary across sites, dominant characteristics are found to be consistent with previous studies over these sites and with bottom-up anthropogenic and fire emission inventories. The site in Pasadena shows a dominant local influence (> 60 %) across all species enhancement ratios, which appear to come from a mixture of biospheric and combustion activities. In contrast, Anmyeondo shows more regionally influenced (> 60 %) air masses associated with high-temperature and/or biofuel combustion activities. Ascension Island appears to only show a large regional influence (> 80 %) on CO / CO2 and CO / CH4, which is indicative of transported and combustion-related CO from the nearby African region, consistent with a sharp rise in column CO (3.51 ± 0.43 % ppb yr−1) at this site. These methods have important applications to source analysis using spaceborne column retrievals of these species."

Thornton;Urs Rohner;Felipe Lopez-Hilfiker,Evaluation of a reduced-pressure chemical ion reactor utilizing adduct ionization for the detection of gaseous organic and inorganic species,"We present a newly designed reduced-pressure chemical ionization reactor for detection of gas-phase organic and inorganic species. The system operates through the combined use of vacuum ultraviolet ionization and photosensitizers to generate numerous adduct ionization schemes. As a result, it offers the ability to simultaneously measure a wide variety of organic and inorganic species in terms of compound volatility and functionality, while being largely independent of changes in sample humidity. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and volatile inorganic compounds (VICs) provide critical information across many scientific fields including atmospheric chemistry and soil and biological processes. Chemical ionization (CI) mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool for tracking these chemically complex and temporally variable compounds in a variety of laboratory and field environments. It is particularly powerful with time-of-flight mass spectrometers, which can measure hundreds of compounds in a fraction of a second and have enabled entirely new branches of VOC and/or VIC research in atmospheric and biological chemistry. To accurately describe each step of these chemical, physical, and biological processes, measurements across the entire range of gaseous products is crucial. Recently, chemically comprehensive gas-phase measurements have been performed using many CI mass spectrometers deployed in parallel, each utilizing a different ionization method to cover a broad range of compounds. Here we introduce the recently developed Vocus AIM (adduct ionization mechanism) ion–molecule reactor (IMR), which samples trace vapors in air and ionizes them via chemical ionization at medium pressures. The Vocus AIM supports the use of many different reagent ions of positive and negative polarity and is largely independent of changes in the sample humidity. Within the present study, we present the performance and explore the capabilities of the Vocus AIM using various chemical ionization schemes, including chloride (Cl−), bromide (Br−), iodide (I−), nitrate (NO3-), benzene cations (C6H6+), acetone dimers ((C3H6O)2H+), and ammonium (NH4+) reagent ions, primarily in laboratory and flow tube experiments. We report the technical characteristics and operational principles, and compare its performance in terms of time response, humidity dependence, and sensitivity to that of previous chemical ionization approaches. This work demonstrates the benefits of the Vocus AIM reactor, which provides a versatile platform to characterize VOCs and VICs in real time at trace concentrations."

The paper deals with technical aspects of this process and shows how the reconstruction of the spectrum can be optimized. 
 Correct determination of the phase spectrum is a highly relevant task in Fourier Transform Spectrometry for concluding which spectral distribution connects with the measured interferogram. We present implementation of an improved scheme for phase determination in the operational Collaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON) processor. We introduce a robust unwrapping scheme for retrieving a connected phase spectrum at intermediate spectral resolution, which uses all spectral positions carrying enough signal to allow a significant determination of the phase. In the second step, we perform a least squares fit of model parameters of a suited analytical phase spectrum model through all reliable phase values constructed in the first step. The model fit exploits the fact that we expect the phase to be spectrally smooth. Still, it can be refined to reflect specific characteristics inherent to the optical and electronic layout of the interferometer. The proposed approach avoids the problems of the classical phase reconstruction method, which enforce a spectrally smooth phase by directly limiting spectral resolution when calculating the complex phase. Thereby, the phase is created from a very low number of interferogram points around the centerburst of the interferogram, which results in a suboptimal noise propagation from the interferogram into the spectral domain. Moreover, the interpolation of the phase spectrum across spectral subsections with reduced spectral signal is not well behaved and results depend strongly on the numerical apodization function used for creating the low-resolution phase."

Exhaustive efforts have been made towards standardising almost every facet of the information provided by major public reporting networks, which is saved in 21 data variables and 163 metadata variables. Extensive effort in particular is made towards the standardisation of measurement process information and station classifications. Extra complementary information is also associated with measurements, such as metadata from various popular gridded datasets (e.g. land use) and temporal classifications per measurement (e.g. day or night). A range of standardised network quality assurance flags is associated with each individual measurement. GHOST's own quality assurance is also performed and associated with measurements.

The evaluation and validation results confirm the reliability of this dataset. The altimeter-based virtual stations along the world’s coastlines can be built from this dataset to monitor the coastal sea level changes where tide gauges are unavailable. Therefore, it would be beneficial for both oceanographic communities and policy makers. 
 A new dedicated coastal sea level dataset called the International Altimetry Service 2024 (IAS2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13208305, Peng et al., 2024c) has been presented to monitor sea level changes along the world’s coastlines. One of the reasons for generating this dataset is the quality of coastal altimeter data has been greatly improved with advanced coastal reprocessing strategies. In this study, the Seamless Combination of Multiple Retrackers (SCMR) strategy is adopted to obtain the reprocessed Jason data for January 2002 and April 2022. The evaluation results show that the data availability of the IAS2024 dataset over global coastal oceans is much higher than that of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative version 2.3 (ESA CCI v2.3) dataset. The closure of trend differences (0.16 ± 3.98 mm yr−1) between IAS2024 and Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) tide gauge data is observed at the global scale, which further demonstrates the good performance of the IAS2024 dataset in monitoring the coastal sea level changes. The altimeter-based virtual stations have been built with the IAS2024 dataset over 0−10 km, 5−15 km and 10−20 km coastal strips, which will contribute to the analysis of coastal sea levels for the ocean community and the risk management for the policy makers. Our study also points out that no obvious variations exist in linear sea level trends from offshore to the coast in most coastal zones. In addition, the vertical land motion (VLM) estimates from the combination of coastal altimeter data with tide gauge records agree well with the University of La Rochelle 7a (ULR7a) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) solution (0.09 ± 2.22 mm yr−1), suggesting that altimeter-derived VLM estimates can be an independent data source to validate the GNSS solutions."

 Seismic facies classiﬁcation is crucial for seismic stratigraphic interpretation and hydrocarbon reservoir characterization but remains a tedious and time-consuming task that requires signiﬁcant manual effort. The data-driven deep learning approaches are highly promising to automate the seismic facies classiﬁcation with high efﬁciency and accuracy, as they have already achieved signiﬁcant success in similar image classiﬁcation tasks within the ﬁeld of computer vision (CV). However, unlike the CV domain, the ﬁeld of seismic exploration lacks a comprehensive benchmark dataset for seismic facies, severely limiting the development, application, and evaluation of deep learning approaches in seismic facies classiﬁcation. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive workﬂow to construct a massive-scale benchmark dataset of seismic facies and evaluate its effectiveness in training a deep learning model. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst develop a knowledge graph of seismic facies based on the geological concepts and seismic reﬂection conﬁgurations. Guided by the graph, we then implement three strategies of ﬁeld seismic data curation, knowledge-guided synthesization, and GAN-based generation to construct a benchmark dataset of 8000 diverse samples for ﬁve common seismic facies. Finally, we use the benchmark dataset to train a network and then apply it on two 3-D seismic data for automatic seismic facies classiﬁcation. The predictions are highly consistent with expert interpretation results, demonstrating the diversity and representativeness of our benchmark dataset is sufﬁcient to train a network that can generalize well in seismic facies classiﬁcation across ﬁeld data.

We test the new snow model over a set of sites where in situ observations are available. We find that when compared to a simpler snow model, this model improves predictions of seasonal snow and of soil temperature under the snowpack, important variables for simulating both the hydrological cycle and the global climate system. 
 Snowpacks modulate water storage over extended land regions and at the same time play a central role in the surface albedo feedback, impacting the climate system energy balance. Despite the complexity of snow processes and their importance for both land hydrology and global climate, several state-of-the-art land surface models and Earth System Models still employ relatively simple descriptions of the snowpack dynamics. In this study we present a newly-developed snow scheme tailored to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) land model version 4.1. This new snowpack model, named GLASS (Global LAnd–Snow Scheme), includes a refined and dynamical vertical-layering snow structure that allows us to track the temporal evolution of snow grain properties in each snow layer, while at the same time limiting the model computational expense, as is necessary for a model suited to global-scale climate simulations. In GLASS, the evolution of snow grain size and shape is explicitly resolved, with implications for predicted bulk snow properties, as they directly impact snow depth, snow thermal conductivity, and optical properties. Here we describe the physical processes in GLASS and their implementation, as well as the interactions with other surface processes and the land–atmosphere coupling in the GFDL Earth System Model. The performance of GLASS is tested over 10 experimental sites, where in situ observations allow for a comprehensive model evaluation. We find that when compared to the current GFDL snow model, GLASS improves predictions of seasonal snow water equivalent, primarily as a consequence of improved snow albedo. The simulated soil temperature under the snowpack also improves by about 1.5 K on average across the sites, while a negative bias of about 1 K in snow surface temperature is observed."

However, increasing mechanical recycling may have unintended negative consequences. For example, recycling of PVC flooring containing hazardous plasticizers that were used in the past may lead to continued exposure. Here we propose measures to increase recycling while circumventing adverse health impacts caused by legacy additives. For this, we conduct a dynamic substance flow analysis for Switzerland and the time period from 1950 to 2100, focusing on three plasticizers: di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisononyl phthalate (DiNP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT). We quantify the uncertainty of results, check their plausibility against measured concentrations in samples representative for the Swiss market, and compare them with modeled substance flows in Germany. Based on the cross-checked model, future average concentrations of DEHP in PVC flooring on the Swiss market are expected to be above the legal limit of 0.1 wt % for several decades if increased recycling rates are implemented without additional measures. Phasing out the potentially concerning DiNP, too, and preventing phthalates from entering recycling would lower their average market concentrations to values below 0.1 wt % and enable increasing recycling rates without compromising product safety. Analogous measures could help achieve this goal across other European countries and product groups."

Yet, understanding their contribution to global biogeochemical cycling of mercury remains elusive. Here, we show that microbial transformation of nanoparticulate divalent mercury can be an important source of elemental and methylmercury.Geobacter sulfurreducensPCA, a model bacterium predominant in anoxic environments (e.g., paddy soils), simultaneously reduces and methylates nanoparticulate Hg(II). Moreover, the relative prevalence of these two competing processes and the dominant transformation pathways differ markedly between nanoparticulate Hg(II) and its dissolved and bulk-sized counterparts. Notably, even when intracellular reduction of Hg(II) nanoparticles is constrained by cross-membrane transport (a rate-limiting step that also regulates methylation), the overall Hg(0) formation remains substantial due to extracellular electron transfer. With multiple lines of evidence based on microscopic and electrochemical analyses, gene knockout experiments, and theoretical calculations, we show that nanoparticulate Hg(II) is preferentially associated with c-type cytochromes on cell membranes and has a higher propensity for accepting electrons from the heme groups than adsorbed ionic Hg(II), which explains the surprisingly larger extent of reduction of nanoparticles than dissolved Hg(II) at relatively high mercury loadings. These findings have important implications for the assessment of global mercury budgets as well as the bioavailability of nanominerals and mineral nanoparticles."

C. Simon and Jennifer G. Murphy,Ozone Uptake Kinetics and Implications for the Extent of Modification of Airborne Pollen,"Ground-level ozone, a highly reactive air pollutant, is known to cause significant damage to biological surfaces. Understanding the interaction between ozone and pollen is crucial, as it may influence pollen allergenicity and reproductive viability. Measurements were conducted to determine the kinetics and extent of ozone uptake for 12 different types of tree pollen (Birch, Sycamore Maple, Box Elder Maple, Alder Gray, Cypress, Ash, Mulberry, Juniper, White Pine, Lombardy Poplar, Red Oak, and Black Oak). The results revealed an initial rapid uptake of ozone, followed by a gradual decline due to the saturation of surface reaction sites and the depletion of reactive substances. The geometric initial uptake coefficients (γ0-geo) ranged from 0.4 to 6.4 ×  10–5, and surface saturation was reached under our experimental conditions on a time scale of 1500–10,000 s. Using the integrated uptake of ozone over the observation period, we calculated surface site concentrations of 1014–1016 sites cm–2. Most experiments were performed under dry conditions, but tests with Birch at intermediate relative humidities, up to 60%, showed that the presence of water may decrease the uptake coefficient by a factor of 2. When Ash, Birch and Black Oak pollen grains were manually crushed to mimic subpollen particles, they were found to take up orders of magnitude more ozone for the same mass of pollen. For pollen grains washed in acetone to extract soluble molecules from the pollen coat, the cumulative ozone uptake for some pollen types was significantly reduced. This reduction was interpreted to arise as a loss of reactive surface sites and lipids with C═C bonds, which are crucial for ozone interactions. The presence of highly antioxidant molecules, like carotenoids in Ash, was confirmed spectroscopically, and linked to the extremely high cumulative uptake of ozone, suggesting a protective role for the pollen coat. A box model representing diurnally varying emissions, ozone oxidation and deposition was used to estimate the typical extent of oxidation of airborne pollen. The model indicated that surface oxidation peaked in the afternoon and evening concurrent with high ozone levels, and the percent oxidation ranged from 24% to 97% depending on the pollen species. Sensitivity analysis suggested that conclusively determining whether pollen grains are fully oxidized or unoxidized in the atmosphere is challenging. Instead, the extent of oxidation falls within a range that warrants further investigation into its impact on pollen and human exposure."

Gao;Anne Sophie Daloz,High‐Resolution Modeling and Projecting Local Dynamics of Differential Vulnerability to Urban Heat Stress,"Climate change‐induced heat stress has significant effects on human health, and is influenced by a wide variety of factors. Most assessments of future heat‐related risks however are based on coarse resolution projections of heat hazards and overlook the contribution of relevant factors other than climate change to the negative impacts on health. Research highlights sociodemographic disparities related to heat stress vulnerability, especially among older adults, women and individuals with low socioeconomic status, leading to higher morbidity and mortality rates. There is thus an urgent need for detailed, local information on demographic characteristics underlying vulnerability with refined spatial resolution. This study aims to address the research gaps by presenting a new population projection exercise at high‐resolution based on the Bayesian modeling framework for the case study of Madrid, using demographic data under the scenarios compatible with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. We examine the spatial and temporal distribution of population subgroups at the intra‐urban level within Madrid. Our findings reveal a concentration of vulnerable populations, as measured by their age, sex and educational attainment level in some of the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods. These vulnerable clusters are projected to widen in the future unless a sustainable trajectory is realized, driving vulnerability dynamics toward a more uniform and resilient change. These results can guide local adaptation efforts and support climate justice initiatives to protect vulnerable communities in urban environments."

China's quest for reducing carbon emissions will promisingly benefit the air quality, yet its impact on carbon sinks remains unclear. Here, we assess the effect of China's clean air actions and carbon neutrality policy on air quality and its associated co‐benefits for terrestrial carbon sinks by integrating multiple observations and numerical modeling. We find a quadratic response of plant photosynthesis to aerosol loading due to trade‐offs between diffuse fertilization effect and light limitations. The estimations show that China's air pollution suppresses terrestrial carbon uptake through aerosol‐induced light limitations, leading to a 7.3% decrease in plant productivity in the 2010s. In the context of carbon neutrality pledge, the associated aerosol reductions tend to alleviate the suppression and produce an additional CO2 removal of 0.39 GtCO2 year−1. Our results uncover the enhanced terrestrial carbon sinks by aerosol mitigation, highlighting the synergy between carbon neutrality and clean air."

Here the authors report the design and characterization of a risedronate-manganese-based nanosystem for in situ vaccination, amplifying RT-mediated anti-tumor immunity in preclinical models. 
 The irradiated tumor itself represents an opportunity to establish endogenous in situ vaccines. However, such in situ cancer vaccination (ISCV) triggered by radiation therapy (RT) alone is very weak and hardly elicits systemic anticancer immunity. In this study, we develop two-dimensional risedronate-manganese nanobelts (RMn-NBs) as an adjuvant for RT to address this issue. RMn-NBs exhibit good T2 magnetic resonance imaging performance and enhanced Fenton-like catalytic activity, which induces immunogenic cell death. RMn-NBs can inhibit the HIF-1α/VEGF axis to empower RT and synchronously activate the cGAS/STING pathway for promoting the secretion of type I interferon, thereby boosting RT-triggered ISCV and immune checkpoint blockade therapy against primary and metastatic tumors. RMn-NBs as a nano-adjuvant for RT show good biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy, presenting a promising prospect for cancer radiotherapy and immunotherapy.

Here, the authors illustrated the role of AtPRMT3-RPS2B in maintaining ribosome assembly and coordinating growth-stress trade-off. 
 Translation, a fundamental process regulating cellular growth and proliferation, relies on functional ribosomes. As sessile organisms, plants have evolved adaptive strategies to maintain a delicate balance between growth and stress response. But the underlying mechanisms, particularly on the translational level, remain less understood. In this study, we revealed the mechanisms of AtPRMT3-RPS2B in orchestrating ribosome assembly and managing translational regulation. Through a forward genetic screen, we identified PDCD2-D1 as a suppressor gene restoring abnormal development and ribosome biogenesis in atprmt3-2 mutants. Our findings confirmed that PDCD2 interacts with AtPRMT3-RPS2B, and facilitates pre-ribosome transport through nuclear pore complex, finally ensuring normal ribosome translation in the cytoplasm. Additionally, the dysfunction of AtPRMT3-RPS2B was found to enhance freezing tolerance. Moreover, we revealed that AtPRMT3-RPS2B promotes the translation of housekeeping mRNAs while concurrently repressing stress-related mRNAs. In summary, our study sheds light on the regulatory roles of AtPRMT3-RPS2B in ribosome assembly and translational balance, enabling the trade-off between growth and stress.

 Climate change is shifting animal distributions. However, the extent to which future global habitats of threatened marine megafauna will overlap existing human threats remains unresolved. Here we use global climate models and habitat suitability estimated from long-term satellite-tracking data of the world’s largest fish, the whale shark, to show that redistributions of present-day habitats are projected to increase the species’ co-occurrence with global shipping. Our model projects core habitat area losses of >50% within some national waters by 2100, with geographic shifts of over 1,000 km (∼12 km yr−1). Greater habitat suitability is predicted in current range-edge areas, increasing the co-occurrence of sharks with large ships. This future increase was ∼15,000 times greater under high emissions compared with a sustainable development scenario. Results demonstrate that climate-induced global species redistributions that increase exposure to direct sources of mortality are possible, emphasizing the need for quantitative climate-threat predictions in conservation assessments of endangered marine megafauna. The authors use long-term satellite tracking to project climate-induced shifts in whale shark distributions and understand their potential future risk of ship-strike.

 Aquifer depletion due to intensive irrigation threatens global economies, food security and ecosystems. This Perspective examines the hydrological, social and economic complexities of managing groundwater resources, focusing on the Sheridan 6 Local Enhanced Management Area in the US High Plains aquifer. Here irrigator-led conservation efforts reduced groundwater use by 25% and slowed aquifer depletion by 65% while maintaining farmers’ incomes. This success resulted from a hybrid integration of bottom-up rule development with top-down enforcement, providing flexible multi-year water allocations and aligning management with local conditions.

 The Atlantic Niño, a primary climatic variability mode in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, exhibits pronounced variability not only in boreal summer but also in winter. However, the role of the winter Atlantic Niño in trans-basin interactions remains underexplored compared to its summer counterpart. Through analysis of observational reanalysis data since the mid-twentieth century, here we found that the winter Atlantic Niño significantly influences the development of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), surpassing the impact of summer Atlantic Niño, with a longer lead time. This effect is reasonably captured in the CMIP6 Historical simulations from a multi-model ensemble perspective. Further analysis of the global warming scenario projects that the influence of winter Atlantic Niño on ENSO will persist into the future, in contrast to the reduced impact of summer Atlantic Niño. Therefore, these findings underscore the importance of further investigating the winter Atlantic Niño to gain a comprehensive understanding of trans-basin interactions and their future changes."

 Compound events have become more frequent and diverse under global warming. This study specifically focuses on a type of compound events termed spatially compounding flood-nocturnal heat events over adjacent regions. Five flood hotspots are identified to compound with adjacent nocturnal heat. The flood and nocturnal heat are linked via a water vapor transport belt, with flood over the region of prominent water vapor convergence and ascending anomalies and nocturnal heat over the extension region with moderately increased humidity and weak vertical motion anomaly. The compound events for all the hotspots occur more frequently recently, with commonly positive contribution from the increasing trends of nocturnal temperature (TN) but various contribution from the trends of precipitation (Pr) and Pr-TN correlation. The positive contribution of enhanced Pr-TN correlation results from the enhanced variability of the circulation accompanied with water vapor transport.

 Ongoing warming intensifies snowpack extremes, posing significant hydroclimatic risks to socio-ecological systems. However, the relation between snowpack extremes and subsequent compound hydroclimatic extremes remains unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of snowpack extremes on warm-season compound hydroclimatic extremes in the Northern Hemisphere using multisource datasets from 1980 to 2022. We found widespread increases in deficient, short, and deficient-short snowpack extremes, triggering more compound hot-dry extremes within a month after snowpack disappearance (mean coincidence rate over 0.6, p < 0.05). The impact of compound snowpack extremes exceeded that of individual snowpack extremes in both areas (over 10%) and coincidence rates (over 0.2). Meanwhile, increased intensity, rather than frequency, of snowpack extremes drove mainly the occurrence of compound hydroclimatic extremes. Furthermore, background climate factors, followed by vegetation, topography, and soil, affected relations between snowpack and compound hydroclimatic extremes. These findings will deepen our understanding of the emerging consecutive extremes and improve their predictability.

Both estimates show consistent, statistically significant trends. 
 Estimating accurate oil and gas methane emissions has been a global challenge, highlighted by a twofold discrepancy between atmospheric measurement-based estimates and emission inventories. The principle of continuous improvement in Canada’s National Inventory Report has led to an unstable baseline in recent years for tracking emission reduction progress. The gaps between previous inventory estimates and inversions exceeded 60%. Here we show that incorporating new source-resolved information derived from low-altitude aerial survey data has narrowed this gap by 80%, reducing the discrepancy to 10% for the 2010–2014 baseline. This study proposes a hybrid emission reporting framework, complemented by an ensemble inversion top-down method using continuous tower-based atmospheric measurements, to establish a stable baseline and provide independent verification. As the 2030 target year for emission reduction approaches, we report a significant 27% decline (19%–34%) in inverse oil and gas methane emissions from 2010 to 2022 in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, and a 41% decline (26%–56%) as calculated using the 2024 official inventory.

 The Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) is an imaging spectrometer launched to the International Space Station in July 2022 to measure the mineral composition of Earth’s dust-producing regions. We present a systematic accuracy assessment of the EMIT surface reflectance product in two parts. First, we characterize the surface reflectance product’s overall performance using multiple independent vicarious calibration field experiments with hand-held and automated field spectrometers. We find that the EMIT surface reflectance product has a standard error of ±1.0% in absolute reflectance units for temporally coincident observations. Discrepancies rise to ±2.7 % for spectra acquired at different dates and times of day, which we attribute mainly to changes in solar geometry. Second, we develop an error budget that explains the differences between EMIT and in-situ field spectrometer data. We find that uncertainties in spatial footprints, field spectroscopy, and the EMIT-reported measurement were sufficient to explain discrepancies in most cases. Our approach did not detect any systematic calibration or reflectance errors in the timespan considered. Together, these findings demonstrate that a space-based imaging spectrometer can acquire high-quality spectra across a wide range of observational and atmospheric conditions."

 Stereo matching is essential for establishing pixel-level correspondences and estimating depth in scene reconstruction. However, applying stereo matching networks to UAV scenarios presents unique challenges due to varying altitudes, angles, and rapidly changing conditions, unlike the controlled settings in autonomous driving or the uniform scenes in satellite imagery. To address these UAV-specific challenges, we propose the CSStereo network (Contrastive Learning and Feature Selection Stereo Matching Network), which integrates contrastive learning and feature selection modules. The contrastive learning module enhances feature representation by comparing similarities and differences between samples, thereby improving discrimination among features in UAV scenarios. The feature selection module enhances robustness and generalization across different UAV scenarios by selecting relevant and informative features. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CSStereo in UAV scenarios, and show superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative assessments."

 Mangroves are one of the most important marine ecosystems globally, their spatial distribution is crucial for promoting mangrove ecosystems conservation, restoration, and sustainable managements. This study proposed a novel Unet-Multi-Scale High-Resolution Vision Transformer (UHRViT) model for classifying mangrove species using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-RGB), UAV-LiDAR, and Gaofen-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (GF-3 SAR) images. The UHRViT utilized a multi-scale high-resolution visual Transformer as its backbone network and was designed to a multi-branch U-shaped network structure to extract features of different scales layer by layer, and to facilitate the interaction of high and low-level semantic information. We further verified the classification performance superiority of UHRViT model by comparing to HRViT and HRNetV2 algorithms. We also systematically investigated the effects of active–passive image combination ratios on mangrove communities mapping. The results revealed that: UAV-RGB images exhibited the better classification accuracy (mean F1-score＞95 %) for mangrove species than UAV-LiDAR and GF-3 SAR images; The classification performances and stability of UHRViT algorithm in the fifteen datasets outperformed the HRViT and HRNetV2 algorithms; Combining UAV-RGB with GF-3 SAR or UAV-LiDAR images respectively, both achieved better classifications than the single data source. Based on the UHRViT algorithm, the combination of UAV-RGB and UAV-LiDAR achieved the highest classification accuracy (Iou = 0.944, MIou = 50.2 %) for Avicennia corniculatum (AC). When the combination ratio of UAV-RGB with GF-3 SAR or UAV-LiDAR was 3:1, Avicennia marina and AC both obtained the optimal classification accuracy with average F1-scores of 98.19 % and 97.3 %, respectively. Our works revealed that the changes in the classification accuracies of mangrove communities under multi-sensor image combination ratios, and demonstrated that our model could effectively improve the classification accuracy of mangrove communities."

 Rice, a crucial global food crop, necessitates accurate mapping for food security assessment. China, a major rice producer and consumer, includes Jiangsu Province as a significant rice production region. The Hongzehu (HZH) area in Jiangsu contributes substantially to rice supply, supporting food security locally and province-wide. Sentinel-1 SAR data, particularly Single Look Complex (SLC) products, holds promise for precise crop mapping with enhanced phase and polarization information, enhancing sensitivity to rice growth changes by analyzing rice surface features information. However, challenges persist, especially climate impacts and timing inconsistencies between fields for planting rice. To overcome this, our study proposes a progressive feature screening and fusion method using multi-temporal SAR images. We introduce fuzzy coarse screening based on statistical distribution characteristics and refine it with Gaussian fitting. A model incorporating time-series sample separation and polarization decomposition feature fusion based on rice growth height enhances rice growth expression. For more precise results, we advocate a multi-temporal feature fusion approach using optimized sample features in the BiLSTM network to characterize rice growth and ground features. Experimental results demonstrate the method’s efficacy in two cities with a limited number of sampling points. The progressive feature fusion (DF) method outperforms classical classification methods using single feature (SF) or combined features (CF). Our proposed strategy proves effective for rice mapping applications, providing a promising approach for leveraging Sentinel-1 SLC SAR data. In conclusion, our study enhances accuracy in identifying rice fields and characterizing rice growth, contributing to improved food security assessments despite challenges associated with rainy seasons and planting times."

 Hyperspectral imaging of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is required for plant phenotyping and stress detection. However, the most accurate instruments for SIF quantification, such as sub-nanometer (≤1-nm full-width at half-maximum, FWHM) airborne hyperspectral imagers, are expensive and uncommon. Previous studies have demonstrated that standard narrow-band hyperspectral imagers (i.e., 4–6-nm FWHM) are more cost-effective and can provide far-red SIF quantified at 760 nm (SIF760), which correlates strongly with precise sub-nanometer resolution measurements. Nevertheless, narrow-band SIF760 quantifications are subject to systematic overestimation owing to the influence of the spectral resolution (SR). In this study, we propose a modelling approach based on the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model with the objective of enhancing the accuracy of absolute SIF760 levels derived from standard airborne hyperspectral imagers in practical settings. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using airborne imagery acquired from two airborne hyperspectral imagers (FWHM ≤ 0.2-nm and 5.8-nm) flown in tandem on board an aircraft that collected data from two different wheat and maize phenotyping trials. Leaf biophysical and biochemical traits were first estimated from airborne narrow-band reflectance imagery and subsequently used as SCOPE model inputs to simulate a range of top-of-canopy (TOC) radiance and SIF spectra at 1-nm FWHM. The SCOPE simulated radiance spectra were then convolved to match the spectral configuration of the narrow-band imager to compute the 5.8-nm FWHM SIF760. A site-specific model was constructed by employing the convolved 5.8-nm SR SIF760 as the independent variable and the 1-nm SR SIF760 directly simulated by SCOPE as the dependent variable. When applied to the airborne dataset, the estimated SIF760 at 1-nm SR from the standard narrow-band hyperspectral imager matched the reference sub-nanometer quantified SIF760 with root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.5 mW/m2/nm/sr, yielding R2 = 0.93–0.95 from the two experiments. These results suggest that the proposed modelling approach enables the interpretation of SIF760 quantified using standard hyperspectral imagers of 4–6 nm FWHM for stress detection and plant physiological condition assessment."

 Increasing exposure to heatwaves threatens public health, challenging various socioeconomic sectors in the coming decades. Prior studies mostly concentrated on the heatwaves occurring in specific regions by examining temperature durations, ignoring the fact that heatwaves typically swept across a large area. To comprehensively assess the effects of heatwaves, we jointly analyzed public attention to heatwaves using a dataset of over 10 million geo-located Weibo tweets across 321 cities in China. By considering spatial disparities, two kinds of public attention at city level, namely the number of heat-related tweets (NHTs) and the ratio of heat-related tweets (RHTs), were designed to indicate the severity and location of heatwave impacts, respectively. The heat cumulative intensity was used as a proxy for heatwaves, which exhibited more significant correlations with RHTs than NHTs. The multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was employed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of environment, demographic, and economic-social factors. Six city groups were clustered with MGWR coefficients that were consistent with the seven geographic subregions of China.

We link prolonged withdrawal from cocaine to the depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z, coupled with increased genome accessibility and latent priming of gene transcription, in D1 dopamine receptor–expressing medium spiny neurons (D1 MSNs) that relate to aberrant gene expression upon drug relapse. The histone chaperone ANP32E removes H2A.Z from chromatin, and we demonstrate that D1 MSN–selectiveAnp32eknockdown prevents cocaine-induced H2A.Z depletion and blocks cocaine’s rewarding actions. By contrast, very different effects of cocaine exposure, withdrawal, and relapse were found for D2 MSNs. These findings establish histone variant exchange as an important mechanism and clinical target engaged by drugs of abuse to corrupt brain function and behavior."
