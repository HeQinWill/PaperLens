10.5194/acp-25-4767-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了1995年至2014年期间印度人为源和生物质燃烧排放对空气污染和死亡率负担变化的时空模式。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星观测或特定的遥感技术，但它使用了高分辨率的全球化学传输模型（CAM-chem）来模拟和分析PM2.5和O3的浓度变化，这与大气成分分析密切相关。此外，研究结果对于验证和改进基于遥感的空气质量监测具有重要意义。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术有较强的关联性，尤其是在空气质量监测和大气成分分析的应用方面。,"['PM2.5', 'Ozone', 'Anthropogenic emissions', 'Biomass burning', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Chemical transport model']",Bin Luo;Yuqiang Zhang;Tao Tang;Hongliang Zhang;Jianlin Hu;Jiangshan Mu;Wenxing Wang;Likun Xue,Spatial–temporal patterns in anthropogenic and biomass burning emission contributions to air pollution and mortality burden changes in India from 1995 to 2014,"India is facing a severe air pollution crisis that poses significant health risks, particularly from PM2.5 and O3. Our study reveals rising levels of both pollutants from 1995 to 2014, leading to increased premature mortality. While anthropogenic emissions play a significant role, biomass burning also impacts air quality, in particular seasons and regions in India. This study underscores the urgent need for localized policies to protect public health amid escalating environmental challenges. 
 Anthropogenic (ANTHRO) and biomass burning (BB) emissions are major contributors to ambient air pollution, with the latter playing a particularly dominant role in nonurban regions. India has experienced a dramatic deterioration in air quality over the past few decades, but no systematic assessment has been conducted to investigate the individual contributions of ANTHRO and BB emission changes over the long term in India, particularly in nonurban areas. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the long-term trends in particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in India and their mortality burden changes from 1995 to 2014, using a state-of-the-art high-resolution global chemical transport model (CAM-chem). Our simulations reveal a substantial nationwide increase in annual mean PM2.5 (6.71 µg m−3 per decade) and O3 (7.08 ppbv per decade), with the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and eastern central India serving as hotspots for PM2.5 and O3 trend changes, respectively. It is noteworthy that substantial O3 decreases were observed in the northern IGP, potentially linked to nitric oxide (NO) titration due to a surge in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Sensitivity analyses highlight ANTHRO emissions as primary contributors to rising PM2.5 and O3, while BB emissions play a prominent role in winter and spring. In years with high BB activity, the contributions from BB emissions to both PM2.5 and O3 changes were comparable to or even exceeded ANTHRO emissions in specific areas. We further estimate that the elevated air pollutant levels were associated with increased premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 and O3, leading to 97 830 and 73 911 deaths per decade. Although there has been a decrease in premature mortality per capita in the IGP region, population increase has offset its effectiveness."
10.5194/acp-25-4785-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文评估了英国化学与气溶胶模型（UKCA）对南亚和东亚地区对流层二氧化氮（NO2）的模拟结果，并将其与美国宇航局Aura卫星上的臭氧监测仪（OMI）的卫星观测数据进行了比较。研究重点关注NO2的季节性和趋势，发现模型在捕捉NO2的季节性变化方面表现良好，但存在高估NO2浓度的问题，尤其是在冬季中国东部和印度北部等气溶胶负荷较高的地区。论文探讨了可能导致模型偏差的原因，包括气溶胶表面积的低估以及挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）排放的不足。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测来验证和改进大气化学模型，从而提高对空气质量和大气成分的理解。,"['Nitrogen dioxide', 'OMI satellite retrievals', 'Tropospheric NO2', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Satellite observations']",Alok K. Pandey;David S. Stevenson;Alcide Zhao;Richard J. Pope;Ryan Hossaini;Krishan Kumar;Martyn P. Chipperfield,Evaluating tropospheric nitrogen dioxide in UKCA using OMI satellite retrievals over south and east Asia,"Nitrogen dioxide is an air pollutant largely controlled by human activity that affects ozone, methane, and aerosols. Satellite instruments can quantify column NO2 and, by carefully matching the time and location of measurements, enable evaluation of model simulations. NO2 over south and east Asia is assessed, showing that the model captures not only many features of the measurements, but also important differences that suggest model deficiencies in representing several aspects of the atmospheric chemistry of NO2. 
 We compare tropospheric column nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol (UKCA) model version 11.0 with satellite measurements from NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura satellite Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to investigate the seasonality and trends of tropospheric NO2 over south and east Asia (S and E Asia). UKCA is the atmospheric composition component of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM). UKCA was run with nudged meteorology, producing hourly output over S and E Asia for 2005–2015. OMI averaging kernels have been applied to the model hourly data sampled at Aura's local overpass time of 13:45 LT ± 15 min to allow for consistent model–data comparison. Background UKCA and OMI tropospheric column NO2 typically ranges between 0×1015 and 2×1015 molec.cm-2. Diurnal cycles and vertical profiles of the tropospheric NO2 column in UKCA show that the daily minimum tropospheric column NO2 occurs around the satellite overpass time. UKCA captures the seasonality but overestimates NO2 by a factor of ∼ 2.5, especially during winter over eastern China and north India, at times and locations with high aerosol loadings. Heterogeneous chemistry is represented in the version of UKCA used here as uptake of N2O5 on internally generated sulfate aerosol. However, aerosol surface area may be underestimated in polluted locations, contributing to overestimation of NO2. In addition, the model may underestimate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and associated peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) formation, leading to insufficient long-range transport of oxidised nitrogen and also contributing to overestimation of NO2 over polluted regions and underestimation over remote regions. Quantifying and understanding discrepancies in modelled NO2 warrant further investigation as they propagate into modelling of multiple environmental issues."

We analyzed the error sources of the multi-channel calibration coefficients and assessed the results. The results indicate that the uncertainty of the clear-air scattering ratio was within the anticipated range of 7.9 %. 
 The Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (Daqi 1 or DQ-1) was successfully launched in April 2022, with the capability of providing continuous multi-sensor spatial and optical simultaneous observations of carbon dioxide, aerosols, and clouds. The primary payload carried on DQ-1 is an Aerosol and Carbon Detection Lidar (ACDL). The instrument comprises a high-spectral-resolution channel at 532 nm, polarization channels at 532 nm, an elastic scattering channel at 1064 nm, and an integrated-path differential absorption (IPDA) channel at 1572 nm. The optical properties of aerosols and clouds measured by the ACDL promote a quantitative characterization of the uncertainties in the global climate system; hence, precise calibrations for the ACDL are necessary. This paper outlines the algorithms employed for calibrating the nighttime 532 nm measurements for the first spaceborne high-spectral-resolution lidar with an iodine vapor absorption filter. The nighttime calibrations of the 532 nm data are fundamental to the ACDL measurement procedure, as they are utilized to derive the calibrations over daytime orbits and the calibrations of the 1064 nm channel relative to the 532 nm channel. This paper provides a review of the theoretical foundations for molecular normalization techniques as applied to spaceborne lidar measurements and includes a detailed discussion of auxiliary data and theoretical parameters used in ACDL calibrations, as well as a comprehensive description of the calibration algorithm procedure. To mitigate large errors stemming from high-energy events during calibration, a data filter is designed to obtain valid calibration signals. The paper also assesses the results of the calibration procedure by analyzing the errors of calibration coefficients and validating the attenuated backscatter coefficient results. The results indicate that the relative error of the calibrated attenuated backscatter coefficients is lower than 1 % in the calibration area, and the uncertainty of the clear-air scattering ratio was within an anticipated range of 7.9 %."

Nilo;Giandomenico Pace;Bernhard Pospichal;Filomena Romano,Atmospheric stability from numerical weather prediction models and microwave radiometer observations for onshore and offshore wind energy applications,"Atmospheric stability indicates whether air vertical motion is dumped or amplified. This is important for wind energy applications as it affects wind turbine wakes and thus the yield of wind parks. The paper provides an assessment of stability metrics measured by ground-based microwave radiometers in different climatological conditions and instrument types, onshore and offshore. Results indicate that special precaution may be required offshore to achieve typical onshore performances. 
 Atmospheric stability controls the evolution of wind turbine wakes and thus the yield and performance of wind parks. For estimations of wind park power output and for improving analyses of wind park wakes, crucial parameters were found to be profiles of atmospheric temperature and stability metrics. Atmospheric temperature profiles are available from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models or are measured in situ by balloon-borne sensors but can also be estimated from the ground using radiometric observations. This paper reviews the stability metrics useful for monitoring wind park performances and provides a quantitative assessment of the value of NWP model data for estimating these metrics. This paper also extends previous work, quantifying the performances of microwave radiometer (MWR) observations to estimate stability metrics from surface-based observations in three climatological conditions (marine, continental, and polar) and with different instrument types, situated either on land or in the ocean. Two NWP systems (DOWA and NEWA) have been evaluated against temperature profiles measured by offshore met masts in the 30–100 m layer from the surface. The systematic differences are ∼ 0.3–0.5 K, with no clear dependence on the stability class. Conversely, both models show larger random differences in stable compared to unstable conditions. Root-mean-square (rms) differences were within 1 K for DOWA (Dutch Offshore Wind Atlas), while they exceeded 2 K for NEWA (New European Wind Atlas) in very stable conditions. For temperature gradients in the 50–100 m vertical layer, the mean absolute error (MAE) was ∼ 3.4–4.2 K km−1, with 5.8–8.4 K km−1 rms and 0.7–0.8 correlation. From the six datasets of MWR and radiosonde observations considered here, temperature profiles mostly agree within ∼ 0.5 K near the surface, increasing to ∼ 1.5 K at 2 km. Substantial differences are found between MWR performances in retrieving temperature and potential temperature gradients (50–300 m) onshore and offshore. Onshore, potential temperature gradients agree with 2.1–3.4 K km−1 MAE and 0.7–0.9 correlation. Offshore, both MAE (0.9–1.9 K km−1) and correlation (0.3–0.4) are relatively lower, although performances tend to improve using elevation scanning retrievals. Considering all the datasets, the reported MAE values range from 0.9–3.4 K km−1 while rms values range from 1.2–5.1 K km−1. Thus, the uncertainty of MWR for temperature and potential temperature gradients in the 50–300 m vertical layer is ∼ 0.5–4.3 K km−1. The relatively lower performances offshore may be attributed to the training of the inversion method, which may under-represent the peculiar offshore conditions, and the ship movements, which can impact low-elevation observations. These considerations suggest that appropriate dedicated training and elevation scanning with ship movement compensation may be required for the MWR to better catch potential temperature gradients typical of offshore conditions."

These data enhance our understanding of glacier change variability before 2000. When combined with existing research, our dataset provides a nearly 5-decade record of mass balance, aiding hydrological simulations and assessments of mountain glacier contributions to sea-level rise. 
 The highly glacierized eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau is the key source region for seven major rivers: the Yangtze, Yellow, Lancang–Mekong, Nu–Salween, Irrawaddy, Ganges, and Brahmaputra rivers. These rivers are vital freshwater resources for more than 1 billion people downstream for their daily life, irrigation, industrial use, and hydropower. However, glaciers have been receding during recent decades and are projected to decline further, which will partly and temporarily impact water availability during drought periods, especially in headwater catchments of these larger river systems. Although few studies have investigated glacier mass changes in these river basins since the 1970s, they are site- and period-specific and limited by data availability. Hence, knowledge of glacier mass changes is especially lacking for the years prior to 2000. We therefore used digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from large-scale topographic maps based on aerial photogrammetry from the 1970s and 1980s and compared them to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM to provide a complete picture of mass change in glaciers in the region. The mass changes are presented on individual glacier bases with a resolution of 30 m and are also aggregated into gridded format at a resolution of 0.5°. Our database consists of 13 117 glaciers with a total area of ∼ 21 695 km2. The annual mean mass loss of glaciers is −0.30 ± 0.13 mw.e. in the whole region. This is larger than the previous site-specific findings: the surface thinning increases on average from west to east along the Himalayas–Hengduan mountains, with the largest thinning in the Irrawaddy basin. Comparisons between the topographic map-based DEMs and DEMs generated based on Hexagon KH-9 metric camera data for parts in the Himalayas demonstrate that our dataset provides a robust estimation of glacier mass changes. However, the uncertainty is high at high altitudes due to the saturation of aerial photos over low-contrast areas like a snow surface on a steep terrain. The dataset is well-suited to supporting more detailed climatical and hydrological analyses and is available at https://doi.org/10.11888/Cryos.tpdc.301236 (Liu et al., 2024)."

 Here we present Earth TOPOgraphy (ETOPO) 2022, the latest iteration of NOAA's global seamless topographic–bathymetric dataset. ETOPO1, NOAA's prior release at 1 arcmin resolution, has been a widely used benchmark global digital elevation model (DEM) since its initial release in 2009 (Amante and Eakins, 2009). Tsunami forecasting, modeling, and warning systems critically rely upon accurate topographic and bathymetric data to predict and reproduce water movement across global ocean surfaces, wave heights at the coastline, and subsequent land inundation. ETOPO 2022 is an updated topographic–bathymetric dataset at 15 arcsec global resolution that incorporates bare-Earth datasets with forests and buildings removed. ETOPO 2022 integrates more than a dozen source datasets for land topography, sea bathymetry, lake bathymetry, and ice-sheet bed elevation data, all of which have been carefully evaluated for quality, accuracy, and seamless integration. We evaluate the relative and absolute vertical accuracies of all land-elevation input datasets, as well as the final ETOPO 2022 tiles, using a geographically optimized, independent database of bare-Earth elevation photons from NASA's ICESat-2 satellite mission over the calendar year 2021. Measured against more than 960 billion lidar measurements from ICESat-2 that span nearly the entire globe, ETOPO 2022 measures a global RMSE of 7.17 m. ETOPO 2022 is publicly available in both ice surface and bedrock versions that portray either the top layer of the ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica or the bedrock below, and both versions are also available in GeoTIFF and NetCDF formats in 15×15° tiles, as well as global tiles at 30 and 60 arcsec resolutions.

 Spatial predictions of total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations and stocks are crucial for understanding marine sediments’ role as a significant carbon sink in the global carbon cycle. In this study, we present a geospatial prediction of global TOC concentrations and stocks on a 5 × 5 arcmin grid, using a novel neural network approach. We also provide and apply a new compilation of over 21 000 global TOC measurements and a new set of predictors, including features such as seafloor lithologies, benthic oxygen fluxes, and chlorophyll-a satellite data. Moreover, we compare different machine learning models based on their performance metrics and predictions and assess their strengths and limitations. For the dataset used, we find that the performance metrics of the models are comparable and that the neural network approach outperforms, on unseen data, methods such as k-nearest neighbours and random forests, which tend to overfit the training data. We provide estimates of mean TOC concentrations and stocks, both on continental shelves and in deep-sea settings across various marine regions and oceans. Our model suggests that the upper 10 cm of oceanic sediments harbour approximately 156 Pg of TOC stocks and have a mean TOC concentration of 0.61 %. Furthermore, we introduce a standardized methodology for quantifying predictive uncertainty using Monte Carlo dropout. The method was applied to our neural network model and underlying features to generate a map of information gain that measures the expected increase in model knowledge, achieved through additional sampling at specific locations, which is pivotal for sampling strategy planning."

The precise mechanisms by which microcystin-LR, a potent cyanotoxin, disrupts lipid metabolism in amphibian tadpoles remain unclear. In this study, tadpoles (Pelophylax nigromaculatus) were exposed to MC-LR and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments were performed to investigate whether or how MC-LR at environmental concentrations interfered with tadpole lipid metabolism from the perspective of the gut microbiota-gut-liver axis. Following exposure, the liver exhibited significant inflammation, hypertrophy, and fibrosis, accompanied by elevated serum lipid levels. Furthermore, the expression levels of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor, were significantly downregulated. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated a strong and stable binding between FXR and MC-LR. Moreover, MC-LR suppressed liver FXR expression or activity, triggering: (1) upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated triglyceride (TG) synthesis, (2) inhibition of free fatty acid (FFA) β-oxidation, and (3) activation of SREBP2-dependent bile acid biosynthesis. Moreover, MC-LR altered the composition of gut microbiota and specific bile acid levels (e.g., taurocholic acid and glycochenodeoxycholic acid) in the gut, thereby interfering with hepatic lipid metabolism, as evidenced by FMT-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in recipient tadpoles. These findings identify FXR as a potentially key molecular target for MC-LR and suggest that changes in bile acid levels of intestinal microbiota metabolism also may be an important pathway driving hepatic lipid dysregulation in amphibians exposed to environmental concentrations of MC-LR."

Although recent ecotoxicological studies of reptiles have increased, little is known about how these two stressors interact to affect reptile reproductive processes. This study investigated the single and combined effects of atrazine and warming on reproduction in female lizards (Eremias argus) following 10 weeks of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of atrazine (0–10 mg·kg–1) at two temperature treatments (control or warming). Reproductive traits, clutch characteristics, and endpoints related to endocrine disruption (HPG axis gene expression) and energy metabolism (enzyme activity, hepatic metabolomics) were assessed. Atrazine inhibits female reproduction by disrupting HPG axis-related gene expression and energy metabolism, resulting in delayed spawning time and reduced fecundity. In contrast, warming promoted female reproduction and partly alleviated the inhibitory effects of atrazine, which is related to the upregulation of HPG axis-related gene expression and an additional energy metabolism compensatory response. Additionally, atrazine and/or warming altered the direction and intensity of the trade-off between egg number and size and affected maternal nutritional investment in eggs. These findings highlight the complex interplay of environmental stressors on lizard reproduction and add to a better understanding of reptile reproductive strategies and ecological consequences under environmental stress."

PS NPs were mainly accumulated in the cortex and xylem of radish roots and primarily accumulated within the peels via direct adsorption onto tuber surfaces. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that exposure to PS NPs triggered plant defense systems by upregulating gene expression and metabolites involved in flavonoid biosynthesis as well as starch and sucrose metabolisms. However, the downregulation of genes associated with plant hormone signal transduction, as well as the biosynthesis of glucosinolates (the most valued compounds contributing to radish nutrition and flavor), and amino acids reduced crop yield and quality.

The primary goal is to refine emission estimates for key sources, including enteric fermentation, manure, and feed production, using the latest climate science, predictive models, and updated industry data, including a broader range of dietary rations across 12 distinct dairy regions. Compared with previous studies that employed generalized models and less granular data, this approach offers greater accuracy and regional specificity. In addition to establishing the 2020 GHG emissions baseline, we compare the results to 2007 estimates to highlight trends and improvements in emission intensities and production practices. U.S. raw milk production in 2020 generated 138.88 million tonnes of CO2e, corresponding to an average of 1.38 kg CO2e per kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), with regional emissions ranging from 1.24 to 1.87 kg CO2e/kg FPCM. Notably, the study shows that while enteric fermentation and manure emissions remain substantial contributors, their share of total emissions is less than in previous assessments. A sensitivity analysis explores the impact of key methodological choices, ensuring robust results that support mitigation strategies and inform the dairy sector’s path toward net neutrality by 2050."

Our strategy was to tailor suitable Cu–O–Mn coordination environments across numerous types of widely used CuMn bimetallic oxides. Unexpectedly, Cu–O–Mn sites within the CuO phase ignited greater catalytic activity toward alkanes like cyclohexane under 5.0% relative humidity, with a lower T90 at 219 °C, and excellent stability over 48 h, compared to spinel phases noted for electron transfer. Doping CuO with high-valence Mn3+ and Mn4+ prefers to generate oxygen interstitials, facilitating the formation of dual high-valence Cu–O–Mn sites. Notably, optimal Cu3Mn1 simultaneously featured high-valence states of Cu1.98+ and Mn3.22+, as evidenced by the positive correlation between catalytic activity and valence state. Dual high-valence Cu–O–Mn sites within the CuO phase bolstered reactive oxygen species mobility, oxidizability, and replenishment, as well as acid sites, facilitating the Mars-van-Krevelen redox cycles. The resulting enhancement rapidly overcame the rate-limiting step of key intermediate benzene oxidation, endowing higher and sustainable reactivity. The superior performance could be validated through the catalytic oxidation of aromatics and alkenes represented by benzene and 1,3-butadiene, respectively.

Nitrate-driven pollution has long been recognized as a primary contributor to haze formation at the ground surface in Beijing. Here, comprehensive observations of N2O5 and related species were conducted using a unique 528 m platform in Beijing. Elevated N2O5 concentrations (1.3 ppb, 1 h average) were recorded. The average nighttime nitrate production rate from N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis was 5.8 μg·m–3·h–1, while the partitioning of HNO3 at night significantly contributes to nitrate with an average production rate of 7.6 μg·m–3·h–1. As a result, chemical processes dominated by N2O5–NO3 contribute approximately 65% of the total nitrate source. Using a large eddy simulation model, peak nitrate transfers of 14.1 μg//m3 from the residual layer to the surface were found, with a contribution of up to approximately 43% during the nitrate morning peak compared to simultaneous surface measurements. Entrainment effects even persisted into the afternoon, highlighting the vital contribution from thermal shear turbulence mixing. Sensitivity tests further suggest that reducing NOx emissions during boundary-layer mixing could effectively mitigate nitrate formation, thereby improving the ground-level air quality."

Hammerling,Investigating Aerial Data Preanalysis Schemes and Site-Level Methane Emission Aggregation Methods at Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities,"Methane observations at liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities play an important role in characterizing methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. The large size and complexity of LNG facilities make quantifying emissions with ground-based monitoring systems challenging, making aerial platforms one of the preferred methods for detecting and estimating methane emissions at these sites. However, aerial measurements typically provide a snapshot of emissions at a given instance, necessitating further analytical steps to infer both annualized emissions and the range of possible emissions at different instances in time. This study uses aerial measurements at two U.S. LNG facilities from a Quantification, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification project to characterize the distribution of temporally averaged emissions (i.e., annualized inventories) and possible site-level emissions at any given point in time (“instantaneous emissions”). The former provides uncertainty on the aerial measurement component of measurement-informed annual inventories, while the latter helps contextualize future snapshot measurements, such as those from aerial surveys or high-resolution satellite platforms, at LNG facilities. We find that instantaneous emissions may fall well outside of the distribution describing uncertainty in the annual inventory. We also compare different preanalysis schemes for aerial data, as existing literature does not provide a clear consensus on methods for doing so, especially at LNG facilities. We find the persistence assumption to be the most critical preanalysis factor."

This study therefore focuses on the impact of precipitation on daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and daily minimum temperature (Tmin) across China's climatic regions from 1952 to 2019. Results show that precipitation‐induced cooling effects on Tmax through cloud effects and evaporative cooling, particularly in arid and semi‐humid regions. In arid regions, precipitation enhances Tmin through increased downward longwave radiation and changes in soil thermodynamics, while in humid regions, rainfall‐induced evaporative cooling suppresses Tmin. Notably, the Tmax warming trend during rainy weathers lacks statistical significance in humid regions, and Tmin consistently warms more during dry conditions. These findings reveal a saturation effect of precipitation on temperature and provide a framework for understanding precipitation‐temperature interactions, with implications for refining climate model and assessing global warming."

This study presents aircraft‐based observations on 8 May 2020 over a coastal region in China, to investigate the microphysical characteristics of a liquid stratus cloud. Significant differences in aerosols number concentration (Na), cloud droplet concentration (Nc), and drizzle droplet concentration (Nd) are observed, with lower number concentrations in the precipitating part for all three. The effective radius (re) of cloud droplets is smaller, while drizzle droplets exhibit a larger re in the precipitating part. In the non‐precipitating part, drizzle droplet re decreases with altitude, while in the precipitating part, it remains constant due to larger droplets falling out. Aerosol size distribution analysis implies that precipitation mainly scavenges aerosols with sizes smaller than 0.3 μm. Cloud particle size distributions are bimodal, with a broader spectrum in the precipitating part, especially in lower layers. Additionally, drizzles contribute approximately 20% to the total liquid water content in the non‐precipitating part, and 70% in the precipitating part.

Two DA experiments were conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model: the first (DA1) assimilated temperature and humidity profiles from a microwave radiometer (MWR) using 3DVar/GSI‐based system, while second (DA2) extended DA1 by incorporating fine‐gridded initial soil fields from the High‐Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS). The effectiveness of these data sets in improving the forecast accuracy of wintertime meteorological parameters within the boundary layer was evaluated. MWR profiles were validated against simultaneous radiosonde (RS) measurements during the winter seasons of 2017–2019, and bias correction using RS data was implemented to enhance MWR profile accuracy. The results indicated that the assimilation of MWR profiles (DA1) improves the accuracy of near surface temperature and humidity forecasts, conducive for fog conditions. The inclusion of soil state assimilation (DA2) further improves the representation of soil states, thereby better capturing the physical processes associated with fog formation. With DA2, biases in near‐surface meteorological and soil variables were significantly reduced (50% in T2, 16% in RH2, 66% in SM, 46% in ST) compared to DA1. DA2 also improved the representation of surface fog heterogeneity and lifecycle across the IGP, with a spatial skill score of 0.36, versus 0.29 for DA1 and 0.24 without assimilation.

Possible evolution of the morphology of these cloud shields with climate change remain poorly understood. In this study, the sensitivity of the cloud shield to environmental conditions is therefore investigated using a large data set of atmospheric profiles from reanalysis and satellite observations. The initial environmental conditions in stability, thermodynamics, and dynamics are explored. Multilinear regression between morphology and environment is used in a 2D phase space linked to the life cycle of the systems, namely the time to reach the maximum area and the associated maximum area. Dynamical drivers show stronger morphological control than the thermodynamic factors. The result reveals an overwhelming role for wind shear over a deep tropospheric layer in explaining the scale dependence of cloud shield morphology. In particular, the variability of the shield growth rate is very well explained by deep layer shear (R2 > 0.8). The depth of the systems is also strongly related to dynamics and secondly to water vapor loading. These results feed the debate on the relative role of deep‐ versus low‐level shear in influencing deep convection and extend previous precipitation‐centric considerations to the cloud shield of the systems. Possible underlying mechanisms are discussed, and the need to extend previous theoretical considerations on idealized convective geometry toward the whole spectrum of deep convective systems populating the tropical oceans is emphasized."

To stop continued global warming, we understand that we must reach and sustain net‐zero global CO2 emissions, however, there is limited knowledge on how heat extremes might change in net‐zero futures. In this study, we explore possible changes in temperature extreme intensity over the century after net‐zero CO2 emissions using projections from Earth System Models in the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP). Specifically, we investigate how regional single‐day temperature extreme intensities scale with global mean surface temperatures changes before and after net‐zero CO2 emissions. We also explore potential hydrological drivers of changes in temperature extreme scaling by performing focused investigations over the Mediterranean and Southern African regions. Our results show substantial reductions in scaling of temperature extreme intensity after reaching net‐zero CO2 emissions over nearly all land regions, however, scaling changes are dependent on the cumulative emissions prior to reaching net‐zero CO2. Temperature extreme scaling reductions after net‐zero CO2 are also regionally dependent, and the regional magnitudes of scaling reductions tend to favor mid‐latitude land in the Northern Hemisphere relative to tropical and Southern Hemispheric land masses. From focused investigations over the Mediterranean and Southern African regions, we find that changes in atmospheric circulation and local precipitation may play a major role in determining the sign and magnitude of changes in temperature extremes after net‐zero CO2 emissions."

Here, the authors report a Mo₂TiC₂ MXene-supported platinum nanocluster catalyst that requires minimal platinum content and operates efficiently for over 8700 h. 
 Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis stands as a promising technology for sustainable hydrogen production, although its viability hinges on minimizing platinum (Pt) usage without sacrificing catalytic efficiency. Central to this challenge is enhancing the intrinsic activity of Pt while ensuring the stability of the catalyst. We herein present a Mo2TiC2 MXene-supported Pt nanocluster catalyst (Mo2TiC2-PtNC) that requires a minimal Pt content (36 μg cm−2) to function, yet remains highly active and stable. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical simulation provide evidence for anomalous charge transfer from the MXene substrate to PtNC, thus generating highly efficient electron-rich Pt sites for robust hydrogen evolution. When incorporated into a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, the catalyst affords more than 8700 h at 200 mA cm−2 under ambient temperature with a decay rate of just 2.2 μV h−1. All the performance metrics of the present Mo2TiC2-PtNC catalysts are on par with or even surpass those of current hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts under identical operation conditions, thereby challenging the monopoly of high-loading Pt/C-20% in the current electrolyzer design. Reducing platinum use is vital for sustainable hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.

 Simultaneously capturing static images and processing dynamic visual information within a single sensor enables a more comprehensive and efficient acquisition of scene information, thereby enhancing the understanding and processing of complex scenes. However, current artificial visual systems present significant challenges in device integration and multimodal operation. Here, we developed a 640×512-pixel CMOS-integrated organic neuromorphic imager featuring dual modes: standard (frame-based imaging) and synaptic (neuromorphic imaging). In synaptic mode, the system extracts high-resolution spatiotemporal maps (light distribution and motion trajectories) from final frames, decoding temporal sequences of light events through contrast analysis. The neuromorphic device demonstrates adjustable memory behavior through modulation of charge recombination-trapping dynamics, enabling multi-level memory functionality. We further developed a CMOS-compatible photolithography method, which supports high-resolution and non-destructive patterning of organic neuromorphic devices. The fabricated imager allows in-sensor memorization (>18 min) and real-world spatiotemporal imaging with reduced computation resource, demonstrating its potential for industrial monitoring and motion detection.

 The human genome contains millions of copies of retrotransposons that are silenced but many of these copies have potential to become active if mutated, having phenotypic consequences, including disease. However, it is not thoroughly understood how nucleotide changes in retrotransposons affect their jumping activity. Here, we develop a massively parallel jumping assay (MPJA) that tests the jumping potential of thousands of transposons en masse. We generate a nucleotide variant library of four Alu retrotransposons containing 165,087 different haplotypes and test them for their jumping ability using MPJA. We found 66,821 unique jumping haplotypes, allowing us to pinpoint domains and variants vital for transposition. Mapping these variants to the Alu-RNA secondary structure revealed stem-loop features that contribute to jumping potential.

 The K29/K48-linked ubiquitination generated by the cooperative catalysis of E3 ligase Ufd4 and Ubr1 is an enhanced protein degradation signal, in which Ufd4 is responsible for introducing K29-linked ubiquitination to K48-linked ubiquitin chains to augment polyubiquitination. How HECT-E3 ligase Ufd4 mediates the ubiquitination event remains unclear. Here, we biochemically determine that Ufd4 preferentially catalyses K29-linked ubiquitination on K48-linked ubiquitin chains to generate K29/K48-branched ubiquitin chains and capture structural snapshots of Ub transfer cascades for Ufd4-mediated ubiquitination. The N-terminal ARM region and HECT domain C-lobe of Ufd4 are identified and characterized as key structural elements that together recruit K48-linked diUb and orient Lys29 of its proximal Ub to the active cysteine of Ufd4 for K29-linked branched ubiquitination.

 Carbon monoxide is a primary pollutant in energy-rich regions. Here we use a space-based mass-conserving framework based on observed carbon monoxide and formaldehyde columns to quantify carbon monoxide emissions over the energy-driven province of Shanxi, China. Annualized total emissions are seven times higher on average compared with some existing datasets, partly due to the fractional increase in low-emitting area’s energy consumption, resulting in a spatial mis-alignment. This induces a net 7% increase in CO2 emissions. Substantial forcings include atmospheric lifetime (10th and 90th percentile of carbon monoxide and formaldehyde are [1.0, 5.7] days and [0.2, 2.3] hours) and transport. Carbon monoxide decreased year-by-year, although only obvious at the two/three peak emission months. Cross-border transport is important during the same months, including sources from central Shaanxi and western Hebei. Carbon monoxide to nitrogen oxides ratios show obvious differences and give source attribution over industrial areas (including cement, power, iron/steel, and coke).

 The presence of radionuclides in seafood following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in March 2011 have led to widespread and persistent concerns over seafood safety. We assess seafood ingestion doses before and after the accident for adults in the Tohoku Region of Northeast Japan. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we evaluate 23 anthropogenic and natural radionuclides alongside realistic seafood consumption rates. In the first year after the accident, the ingestion dose from accident-derived radionuclides was 19 µSv for consumers exposed to the 95th percentile dose, contributing only 2% of the total seafood ingestion dose, which includes natural radionuclides such as 210Po and 210Pb. After the third year, the dose from accident-derived radionuclides was indistinguishable to that from pre-accident background levels. These findings suggest that, with seafood restrictions in place, the impact of accident-related releases on seafood ingestion doses was minor and relatively short-lived compared with that of natural radionuclides.

 Rare earth element exploration requires a quantitative understanding of factors governing their mobilization and economic concentration. However, the behavior of rare earth elements in carbonate-bearing hydrothermal fluids associated with carbonatite-hosted deposits is poorly understood, and conflicting mechanisms of rare earth transport by anionic ligands and alkali behavior have been described.

Solubility studies of neodymium phosphate were performed at temperatures ranging from 100 to 600 °C in carbonate-bearing solutions. The thermodynamic data determined for the predominant complex were used to model the separation of neodymium from thorium in a simple flow-through system based on fluid and mineral compositions characteristic of carbonatite deposits. Our data suggest that neodymium transport is controlled by the stability of the carbonate species NdCO3OHo, and at temperatures of 500–600 °C, the concentrations of neodymium in solutions can reach ~1000 ppm.

 Shallow coastal systems with tidal flats and barrier islands are valuable assets to coastal protection and unique habitats with thriving biodiversity. Sea level rise threatens to diminish these systems unless sediment accretion compensates submergence. To quantify these dynamics for the world’s largest channel-shoal system, the Wadden Sea, an observed geomorphological time series was created and assessed over three decades. We found how (i) accretion-erosion was asymmetric from deep to shallow, (ii) topographic steepening occurred, and (iii) the morphological evolution was systematic across tidal basins. Peak accretion was observed below tidal low and above tidal high water, while the greatest erosion was found at intermediate subtidal elevations. Most intertidal areas accreted faster than sea level rise, and accretion was prominent at the channel-flat and flat-marsh interfaces. The simultaneous deepening of tidal channels leads to topographic steepening. Overall, the current net sediment import of the Wadden Sea is 19.7 Mm³/yr.

 Global food security is increasingly challenged by climate change and unsustainable agriculture, emphasizing the need for strategies to enhance crop productivity. Understanding the interplay between crop health and soil microbiomes is crucial. This study explores the link between crop health, observed via multi-spectral satellite imagery, and fungal soil microbiome taxonomy. We associate the normalized difference vegetation index with fungal microbiomes in wheat, barley, and maize using a two-step machine learning process. The first step adjusts normalized difference vegetation index values for abiotic confounders using a random forest model trained on Lucas 2018 topsoil and ERA5 climate datasets. The second step clusters operational taxonomy unit counts from fungal DNA, revealing significant differences in residual normalized difference vegetation index values. To identify potential bio-fertilizer candidates, we compare the average relative abundance of operational taxonomy unit clusters and construct sparse biological networks. Key findings are: (I) clusters with higher plant pathogenic genera have lower normalized difference vegetation index values; (II) clusters with higher influential scores for multiple beneficial genera have higher normalized difference vegetation index values; (III) lower abundance taxonomy (1-3%) seems to regulate microbial networks; (IV) the influence of beneficial vs. pathogenic taxonomy is relative to their abundance.

 Oxygen isotope values (δ18O) in benthic foraminifera indicate a marked cooling from the early to late Eocene in the higher latitudes where oceanic bottom water forms. This record is widely interpreted as an indication of global surface cooling, leading to the hypothesis of greater climate sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration in warmer than in cooler climate states. Here we extend the coexistence approach using phylogenetic trees to study Eocene climatic change in the Western Interior of North America based on assemblages of small reptiles. Our results capture and elaborate on climatic features previously inferred for the early Eocene, such as drying during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, but also show that the late Eocene in mid-latitude North America was considerably warmer and wetter than previously thought. Accordingly, the net Eocene cooling trend in benthic foraminiferal δ18O might reflect not global but rather regional, high-latitude phenomena, and hypothesised extreme values of climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling might be revised downward.

 Assimilating crop biophysical traits (e.g., Leaf area index, LAI) derived from remote sensing data into a crop growth model provides an effective way for monitoring spatiotemporal variability of crop biomass and yield. However, traditional complex crop growth models generally require extensive input parameters and computation resources, limiting their applicability for large-area estimation using earth observation data. The Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimation model (SAFY), a semi-physical crop growth model grounded in light use efficiency theory has been widely adopted for satellite-based biomass estimation in major field crops. Despite its utility, SAFY cannot directly simulate sugarcane stalk biomass, a critical metric for sugarcane yield assessment. To address this, we developed SAFY-Sugar, a revised SAFY incorporating a temperature-driven stalk biomass module that partitions daily above-ground biomass into stalk biomass. Multi-temporal LAI (S2-LAI) was first inverted from vegetation indices of Sentinel-2 satellite using a semi-empirical model calibrated with the 250 m GLASS LAI product as reference. The estimated S2-LAI achieved an overall accuracy of 0.50 m2/m2 in RMSE across selected vegetation indices. Two data assimilation strategies to assimilate the S2-LAI into the SAFY or SAFY-Sugar model for above-ground and stalk biomass estimation in fields were tested (1) independently optimizing SAFY and SAFY-Sugar parameters with S2-LAI alone, and (2) pre-optimizing the stalk module using independent farm measurements before assimilation. SAFY employed a fixed biomass allocation coefficient for stalk biomass estimation. Under the first Strategy, SAFY-Sugar demonstrated large improvements in stalk biomass estimation (R2 = 0.94, nRMSE = 26.09 %) compared to SAFY (R2 = 0.92, nRMSE = 32.73 %). The second strategy further enhanced SAFY-Sugar’s accuracy (R2 = 0.98, nRMSE = 14.34 %). For regional application in Chongzuo City (2020 – 2021) using the second strategy, SAFY-Sugar captured spatial yield variability, consistent with the government statistics (nRMSE = 6.61 %). By integrating satellite data assimilation, SAFY-Sugar provides a robust framework for monitoring sugarcane productivity across scales, advancing precision agriculture in sugarcane systems."

Additionally, a novel transfer learning approach enables reliable classification in conflict-affected areas with limited ground-truth data.We achieved high classification accuracy across the 14 major crop types in Ukraine and abandoned land, validated through F1-scores exceeding 90 % for most classes. The fusion of the results generated on the GEE and CDSE platforms enhanced the classification accuracy for minor classes. Our analysis reveals significant reductions in cultivated land in 2022–2024, particularly in conflict zones, where agricultural activity has been heavily disrupted. Overall, Ukraine’s arable land area shrunk by 10 % nationwide. The consistently high accuracy of our classification methodology across the nine-year study period demonstrates its robustness and suitability for long-term monitoring of agricultural dynamics in conflict-affected regions and provides a valuable tool for guiding post-war recovery efforts. Our findings underscore the importance of leveraging satellite data for timely and accurate land use monitoring, supporting policymakers in addressing food security challenges and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

 In the background of global climate change, the trend of atmospheric pollution of the Tibetan Plateau region (TP), where ecosystem is susceptible to their synergistic effects, requires prompt attention. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as an important air pollutant of the TP with a profound social and ecological effect, lacks sufficient investigations. Current assessments on NO2 greatly rely on machine-learning models based on NO2 column derived by Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), which provides observations over 20 years. Meanwhile, an unexpected overestimation in non-urban areas of the TP due to the coarse spatial resolution of OMI strongly impacts the long-term assessment. Consequently, this study proposes a fusion strategy to improve the long-term OMI NO2 column based on the recent available fine-scale NO2 column from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Besides the fine resolution and extended applicability to periods long before available TROPOMI observations, the improved NO2 column obtained by fusion strategy retrieves ground-level NO2 concentrations with enhanced accuracy (with R2 0.831–0.880) and approximately 20% mitigated overestimation. Based on the improved dataset, the urban–rural contrast is revealed, as ground-level NO2 in non-urban regions declines by 0.88 μg/m3 per year, while 14% lower rate is observed in urban regions.

 Droughts are some of the most devastating natural extreme events in sub-Saharan with enormous economic impacts on agrarian economies such as Cameroon. However, knowledge and information on their dynamics and drivers in the five agroecological zones (AEZs) of Cameroon is very scanty leading to poor planning and management. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize agricultural droughts based on soil moisture, explored trends and drivers of scale 3 standardized soil moisture index in the five AEZs of Cameroon at high spatial and temporal resolutions for the period 1990–2022. Results show a predominance of moderate to severe droughts in most parts of the MF AEZ, a general increase in the percent of drought area (PDA) in the last four years averaging at 48% and, a significant increase in droughts for over 65% of the country at 5% level of significance. The observed droughts were found to be significantly internally associated with precipitation, evapotranspiration, vapor pressure deficit and minimum temperature but majorly driven by evapotranspiration, precipitation and vapor pressure deficit with a 52% coefficient of determination. This relationship was well aligned with the first Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) mode that for 34.1% explained variance. Externally, the second EOF mode (21% explained variance) was associated with atmosphere-oceanic teleconnections including Atlantic Meridional Mode, Tropical North Atlantic Index, El-NINO Standardized Precipitation Index and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation Index. While as, the third EOF (9.7% explained variance) corresponded to both precipitation and ENSOs. The results of this study not only inform effective drought planning and management but also help in boosting the forecasting capacity of the Cameroonian climate and water management agencies for agricultural droughts with a good lead time."

 Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites offer high-resolution multispectral imagery widely used for applications such as vegetation phenology assessment, soil dynamics monitoring, and crop yield estimation. However, optical remote sensing data often encounter information gaps due to satellite orbital cycles and adverse atmospheric conditions, which significantly reduce image availability and complicate accurate, timely monitoring of surface change. Although integrating Landsat and Sentinel-2 can mitigate some of these challenges, the spectral differences between the two datasets necessitate spectral adjustments to minimize discrepancies in surface reflectance. Furthermore, Sentinel-2′s distinct red-edge and narrow near-infrared spectral bands play a vital role in vegetation monitoring, and their absence significantly hinders precise tracking of vegetation growth and detailed analysis. In response to these issues, we propose a deep learning framework incorporating an enhanced attention mechanism and multi-scale connection for precise remote sensing image reconstruction. This framework leverages 30-metre Landsat-8 as input to generate the 10-metre resolution Sentinel-2, harmonizing the spectral differences between the two satellites and utilizing the reconstructed images to interpolate missing pixels. The experimental findings demonstrate that the deep learning framework in this study outperforms other methodologies across various essential quantitative metrics. The integrated enhanced attention mechanism significantly improves the accuracy of image reconstruction and visual quality, particularly in restoring fine details. The assessment of transferability further validates the model’s robustness and applicability across different periods and geographic regions. Moreover, using the reconstructed images to interpolate missing data produces a denser NDVI time series, offering great potential for downstream tasks such as crop growth monitoring, identification of key phenological stages, and enabling more precise monitoring and management in agricultural applications."

 Nephrite, as a rare jewelry with a long history, holds great economic value and cultural significance. The Eastern Kunlun Range possesses immense potential for nephrite resources controlled by tectonic evolution and magmatic activities during geological periods. However, the harsh environment and backward prospecting technology have led to stagnation of the nephrite exploration in this area. Remote sensing, as a rapidly advancing technology that is sensitive to mineral identification and structural interpretation, has played a critical role in the exploration of mineral deposits. This study summarized the geological characteristics of nephrite deposits in Nachitai area of the Eastern Kunlun Range, revealing that these deposits exhibit distinct mineral assemblages, lithological, and structural features. Various satellite data, including Landsat-9, GF-5B, and ASTER GDEM, were utilized to extract geological indicators associated with ore formation and discover new exploration targets. Landsat-9 multispectral image was used to preliminarily identify the known nephrite areas through false color composite (FCC) and selective principal component analysis (SPCA). GF-5B hyperspectral data were applied to detect tremolite, dolomite, and chlorite using spectral angle mapper (SAM). ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) data were used for the automatic interpretation of lineaments in the study area. The mapping results show a high degree of consistency with four known open pit mines. Ultimately, fourteen target areas with potential for nephrite formation were delineated through a comprehensive analysis of lithologies, mineral assemblages, and structures within the study area.

 Accurate crop yield estimation enables informed decisions that support efficient and sustainable food production systems. Despite some success in crop yield estimation using deep learning models, they are often referred to as “black boxes” due to their lack of interpretability. Meanwhile, most current models are designed to provide yield estimations without assessing the uncertainty and verifying the contribution of components within the models. This work developed a novel deep learning approach to estimate winter wheat yield in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China by using three remotely sensed indices, vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), leaf area index (LAI), and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) during main growth stages of winter wheat. The attention mechanism (AM) and an interpretable attribution method, backpropagation-based integrated gradients (IG), were incorporated into the deep learning approach to enhance interpretability. Additionally, to address uncertainty limitations the Monte Carlo (MC) dropout was applied to the deep learning approach to assess the uncertainty over time during data accumulation. The proposed approach (AM-CNN-LSTM) combined a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to capture local dependencies in sequences, the temporal data processing capability of long short-term memory (LSTM), and the interpretability of the AM. The AM-CNN-LSTM model had enhanced precision in yield estimation (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 498.08 kg/ha) compared with the CNN, AM-CNN, and CNN-LSTM. The attention weights indicated that the most significant variable influencing wheat yield was FPAR, followed by LAI and VTCI. The results of IG showed that the FPAR at the jointing and heading-filling stages, LAI at the heading-filling and milk maturity stages, and VTCI at the jointing stage contributed more to the yield. The MC dropout results showed that the level of model uncertainty decreased steadily as time advanced from late March to late April and stabilized around mid-May."

 One predominant source of microplastics emitted into the atmosphere is tyre- and road wear particles (TRWPs). Only a handful of studies have quantified atmospheric TRWP concentrations. Our objective was to study variations in TRWPs, compared to other primary traffic pollutants, at locations with different traffic conditions.In 2022–2023, three locations with different traffic-flow and speed (a stop-and-go busy road, highway and urban park), were repeatedly visited for 4-hrs resulting in 23 measurement days. Particles were collected on quartz filters using a high-volume sampler with PM10-inlet and analyzed using double-shot pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the mass of synthetic- and natural rubbers (NR). Concentrations of combustion and brake-wear-related traffic air pollutants were measured, including PM10, black carbon (BC), ultrafine particles (UFP) and trace elements. We calculated spatial contrasts and correlations.We observed relatively low levels of sampling- and analysis rubber marker contamination. Synthetic- and NR levels ranged between 2.9 to 42.5 ng/m3 and 1.6 to 26.8 ng/m3, respectively. Compared to the park, rubber markers were 2.8 to 4.6 times higher at the stop-and-go and 2.0 to 2.7 times higher at the highway. These contrasts were larger than for UFP and PM10, but similar to BC and brake-wear related components. Park synthetic rubber levels were modestly higher than field blanks. Rubber markers were highly correlated (r = 0.66 to 0.98) and weakly correlated with most other air pollutants, except for BC and brake wear-related trace elements (r = 0.36 to 0.77).We found substantially increased atmospheric TRWP levels near major roads compared to a park.

 The Pi convection-cloud chamber can generate steady-state turbulence in both rectangular and cylindrical shapes via Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC) by maintaining warm bottom and cold top surfaces. Although most experiments in the Pi chamber were conducted in cylindrical shapes, all previous Pi chamber simulations were conducted in a rectangular shape due to the limitations of those models to discretize a cylindrical domain when using the finite difference method therein. Here, we use OpenFOAM, an open-source finite-volume-based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package, to conduct Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of dry RBC in the Pi chamber at high Rayleigh numbers (108 to 109). Results show that large-scale circulation (LSC) direction varies in the chamber with a constant side wall temperature. Imposing a slight temperature imbalance at the side wall ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 degrees can lock the LSC, aligning better with Pi chamber observations, particularly at higher Rayleigh numbers. In addition, we examine the impact of surface topography on LSC and heat transfer in RBC systems within cylindrical and rectangular shapes under varying conditions. Results show that roughing top/bottom surfaces by adding bars of a few tens millimeters height can strengthen thermal plumes and enhance temperature fluctuations in the chamber. Furthermore, we observe that different bar height configurations lead to notable changes in LSC orientation and thermal stratification, highlighting the complex interactions between surface features and convection patterns. This finding highlights how surface topography and chamber geometry affect Rayleigh-Bénard convection, improving understanding of turbulent heat transfer and atmospheric boundary-layer processes. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are also conducted to validate LES results. While LES effectively captures qualitative behaviors seen in DNS, it tends to underestimate velocity variances near walls, illustrating a trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy."

We found robust Fermi surface (FS) nesting, consistent with the magnetic modulationq-vector detected by the previous resonant x-ray scattering measurements. The pseudogap opens at the nested FS portions, which vary for different magnetic domains. The anomalous pseudogap disconnects the FS to generate Fermi arcs with twofold symmetry. These results indicate that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction plays a decisive role in generating the screw spin modulation responsible for the skyrmion formation in GdRu2Si2.

We describe a microchip-based high-throughput imaging approach offering rapid and precise determination of molecular properties under native solution conditions. Our method detects differences in molecular weight across at least three orders of magnitude and down to two carbon atoms in small molecules. We quantify the strength of molecular interactions across more than six orders of magnitude in affinity constant and track reactions in real time. Highly parallel measurements on individual molecules serve to characterize sample-state heterogeneity at the highest resolution, offering predictive input to model three-dimensional structure. We further leverage the method’s structural sensitivity for diagnostics, exploiting ligand-induced conformational changes in the insulin receptor to sense insulin concentration in serum at the subnanoliter and subzeptomole scale."

DeGrado,De novo design of porphyrin-containing proteins as efficient and stereoselective catalysts,"De novo design of protein catalysts with high efficiency and stereoselectivity provides an attractive approach toward the design of environmentally benign catalysts. Here, we design proteins that incorporate histidine-ligated synthetic porphyrin and heme ligands. Four of 10 designed proteins catalyzed cyclopropanation with an enantiomeric ratio greater than 99:1. A second class of proteins were designed to catalyze a silicon-hydrogen insertion and were optimized by directed evolution in whole cells. The evolved proteins incorporated features unlikely to be generated by computational design alone, including a proline in an α helix. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that as the proteins evolved toward higher activity, their conformational ensembles narrowed to favor more productive conformations. Our work demonstrates that efficient de novo protein catalysts are designable and should be useful for manifold chemical processes."
10.1126/science.adu8988,False,Science,这篇论文主要研究植物中产生二甲基二硫醚（DMDS）的酶的进化，DMDS是一种吸引腐食性传粉媒介的挥发性化合物。论文揭示了二硫键合酶（DSS）如何从一种在动植物中保守的甲硫醇氧化酶（MTOX）进化而来，并且这种DSS酶在其他植物属中独立进化。研究发现，三个氨基酸的改变足以导致MTOX和DSS之间的功能转换。虽然涉及挥发性化合物，但该研究的重点是植物的进化生物学和生物化学，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Yudai Okuyama;Kenji Fukushima;Satoshi Kakishima;Anna K.

We show that dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), a volatile compound that attracts saprophilous pollinators, is produced by a disulfide synthase (DSS) in the plant genusAsarum(Aristolochiaceae). DSS is derived from methanethiol oxidase (MTOX), an enzyme conserved among animals and plants, and similar DSS enzymes have independently evolved in two other plant genera. Three amino acid changes shared among the DSSs of independent origins were sufficient to cause a functional switch between MTOX and DSS. The small number of amino acid changes and the co-option of a highly conserved enzyme may explain why DMDS-emitting flowers are widespread among floral mimics."

Of all intervention kilns, 65% adopted the improved practices. Treatment assignment reduced energy use by 10.5% (P-value <0.001) and decreased CO2and PM2.5emissions by 171 and 0.45 metric tons, respectively, per kiln per year. Valuing the CO2reductions using a social cost of carbon of 185 USD per metric ton, we find that the social benefits outweigh costs by a factor of 65 to 1. The intervention, which required no new capital investment, also decreased fuel costs and increased brick quality. Our results demonstrate the potential for privately profitable, as well as publicly beneficial, improvements to address environmental problems in informal industries."

Martin R.

The spine-covered fossilShishania aculeata(Cambrian Stage 4, Yunnan, China) has been interpreted as intermediate between mollusks and their lophotrochozoan ancestors. Our new material challenges this interpretation. We propose taphonomic explanations for apparent molluscan features and instead identify prominent anatomical similarities to coeval chancelloriids from nearby strata. Our reinterpretation ofShishaniaas an early-diverging chancelloriid helps to consolidate a model for the early evolution of this enduringly problematic group of sponge-like metazoans."
