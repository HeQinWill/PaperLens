Rajeevan,"Reactive chlorine-, sulfur-, and nitrogen-containing volatile organic compounds impact atmospheric chemistry in the megacity of Delhi during both clean and extremely polluted seasons","We quantified 111 gases using mass spectrometry to understand how seasonal and emission changes lead from clean air in the monsoon season to extremely polluted air in the post-monsoon season in Delhi. Averaged total mass concentrations (260 µg m-3) were > 4 times in polluted periods, driven by biomass burning emissions and reduced atmospheric ventilation. Reactive gaseous nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur compounds hitherto unreported from such a polluted environment were discovered. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly impact the atmospheric chemistry of polluted megacities. Delhi is a dynamically changing megacity, and yet our knowledge of its ambient VOC composition and chemistry is limited to few studies conducted mainly in winter before 2020 (all pre-COVID-19). Here, using a new extended volatility range high-mass-resolution (10 000–15 000) proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer, we measured and analysed ambient VOC mass spectra acquired continuously over a 4-month period, covering “clean” monsoon (July–September) and “polluted” post-monsoon seasons, for the year 2022. Out of 1126 peaks, 111 VOC species were identified unambiguously. Averaged total mass concentrations reached ∼ 260 µg m−3 and were > 4 times in the polluted season relative to the cleaner season, as driven by enhanced emissions from biomass burning and reduced atmospheric ventilation (∼ 2). Among 111, 56 were oxygenated, 10 contained nitrogen, 2 chlorine, 1 sulfur, and 42 were pure hydrocarbons. VOC levels during polluted periods were significantly higher than most developed world megacities. Methanethiol, dichlorobenzenes, C6 amides, and C9 organic acids/esters, which have previously never been reported in India, were detected in both the clean and polluted periods. The sources were industrial for methanethiol and dichlorobenzenes, purely photochemical for the C6 amides, and multiphase oxidation and partitioning for C9 organic acids. Aromatic VOC / CO emission ratio analyses indicated additional biomass combustion/industrial sources in the post-monsoon season, along with year-round traffic sources in both seasons. Overall, the unprecedented new information concerning ambient VOC speciation, abundance, variability, and emission characteristics during contrasting seasons significantly advances current atmospheric composition understanding of highly polluted urban atmospheric environments like Delhi."

Hamilton;Sagar D. Rathod;Kara D. Lamb;Natalie M. Mahowald,Representation of iron aerosol size distributions of anthropogenic emissions is critical in evaluating atmospheric soluble iron input to the ocean,"Atmospheric aerosol deposition provides bioavailable iron to promote marine primary production, yet the estimates of its fluxes remain highly uncertain. This study, by performing global aerosol simulations, demonstrates that iron-containing particle size upon emission is a critical factor in regulating soluble iron input to open oceans. Further observational constraints on this are needed to reduce modeling uncertainties. 
 Atmospheric aerosol deposition acts as a major source of soluble (bioavailable) iron in open ocean regions where it limits phytoplankton growth and primary production. The aerosol size distribution of emitted iron particles, along with particle growth from mixing with other atmospheric components, is an important modulator of its long-range transport potential. There currently exists a large uncertainty in the particle size distribution of iron aerosol, and the extent to which such uncertainty shapes global soluble iron deposition remains unclear. Here, we couple a sophisticated microphysical, size-resolved aerosol model with an iron-speciated and iron-processing module to disentangle the impact of iron emission size distributions on soluble iron input to the ocean, with a focus on anthropogenic combustion and metal smelting sources. We evaluate our model results against a global-scale flight measurement dataset for anthropogenic iron concentration and show that the different representations of iron size distribution upon emission, as adopted in previous studies, introduce a variability in modeled iron concentrations over remote oceans of a factor of 10. Shifting the iron aerosol size distribution toward finer particle sizes (< 1 µm) enables a longer atmospheric lifetime (a doubling), promoting atmospheric processing, which enhances the soluble iron deposition to ocean basins by up to 50 % on an annual basis. The monthly enhancements reach 110 % and 80 % over the Southern Ocean and North Pacific Ocean, respectively. Uniquely, our results highlight that compared with emission flux variability, iron emission size distribution plays an equally important role in regulating soluble iron deposition, especially to the remote oceans. Our new findings can help to interpret inter-model differences in iron deposition estimation and to better quantify the effects of atmospheric nutrient input on marine biogeochemistry, including but not limited to iron and phosphorus."

Nagao;Haruma Ishida,Description and validation of the Japanese algorithm for radiative flux and heating rate products with all four EarthCARE instruments: pre-launch test with A-Train,"A Japanese team developed the Level 2 atmospheric radiation flux and heating rate product for EarthCARE, which offers vertical profiles of longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes and heating rates. This study outlines the algorithm for the radiative product and its comparative validation against satellite and ground-based observations. It also analyzes errors in radiative fluxes at various scales and their dependence on cloud type, with ice-containing clouds identified as a primary error source. 
 This study developed an algorithm for the Level 2 (L2) atmospheric radiation flux and heating rate product by a Japanese team for Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE). This product offers vertical profiles of downward and upward longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) radiative fluxes and their atmospheric heating rates. This paper describes the algorithm developed for generating products, including the atmospheric radiative transfer model and input datasets, and its validation against measurement data of radiative fluxes. In the testing phase before the EarthCARE launch, we utilized A-Train data that provided input and output variables analogous to EarthCARE, so that the developed algorithm could be directly applied to EarthCARE after its launch. The results include comparisons of radiative fluxes between radiative transfer simulations and satellite and ground-based observations that quantify errors in computed radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere against Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) observations and their dependence on cloud type with varying thermodynamic phases. For SW fluxes, the bias was 24.4 W m−2, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 36.3 W m−2 relative to the CERES observations at spatial and temporal scales of 5° and 1 month, respectively. On the other hand, LW exhibits a bias of −10.7 W m−2 and an RMSE of 14.2 W m−2. When considering different cloud phases, the SW water cloud exhibited a bias of −11.7 W m−2 and an RMSE of 46.2 W m−2, while the LW showed a bias of 0.8 W m−2 and an RMSE of 6.0 W m−2. When ice clouds were included, the SW bias ranged from 58.7 to 81.5 W m−2 and the RMSE from 72.8 to 91.6 W m−2 depending on the ice-containing cloud types, while the corresponding LW bias ranged from −8.8 to −28.4 W m−2 and the RMSE from 25.9 to 31.8 W m−2, indicating that the primary source of error was ice-containing clouds. The comparisons were further extended to various spatiotemporal scales to investigate the scale dependency of the flux errors. The SW component of this product exhibited an RMSE of approximately 30 W m−2 at spatial and temporal scales of 40° and 40 d, respectively, whereas the LW component did not show a significant decrease in RMSE with increasing spatiotemporal scale. Radiative transfer simulations were also compared with ground-based observations of the surface downward SW and LW radiative fluxes at selected locations. The results show that the bias and RMSE for SW are −17.6 and 172.0 W m−2, respectively, which are larger than those for LW that are −5.6 and 19.0 W m−2, respectively."

They are more affordable, compact, and use less power than traditional OPCs. We tested the ability of the low-cost OPC-N3 from Alfasense to estimate the dust emission flux during erosion events in Jordan.

 The recent development of low-cost optical particle counters (OPCs) presents new opportunities for improving spatial coverage of particle concentration in the atmosphere as they are more affordable, compact, and consume less power than traditional OPCs. In particular, these OPCs could improve our ability to quantify dust emissions in complex environments during aeolian soil erosion. The high frequency sampling capacity (1 Hz) of some sensors may make them suitable for estimating dust emissions using the eddy-covariance method. Here, the capability of the low-cost OPC-N3 from Alfasense to estimate the size-resolved dust flux using the eddy-covariance method is evaluated. During the Jordan Wind Erosion and Dust Investigation (J-WADI) experiment, we tested one OPC-N3 against traditional reference OPCs. The OPCs were located in close proximity to a sonic anemometer, enabling the correlation of dust concentration and vertical velocity fluctuations for estimating dust fluxes. Despite the high temperature and dusty wind conditions of the campaign, the N3 monitored the dynamics and magnitude of dust concentration with reasonable precision. The turbulence characteristics of the dust concentration fluctuations measured by the N3 were similar to those from the reference OPC. After calibrating the N3 dust concentration, the N3 accurately estimated the dust emission flux, with differences of less than 30 % compared to the reference OPC. Our results confirm the potential of low-cost OPCs for dust-erosion research. Nonetheless, further evaluation of low-cost OPCs is still needed across different environments and weather conditions."

Passer;Mikael K. Witte;Patrick Y. Chuang,Aircraft Evaluation of MODIS Cloud Drop Number Concentration Retrievals,"One important property of a cloud is the concentration of cloud drops. This property is relevant to how the cloud interacts with sunlight, and how easily the cloud forms precipitation. Measuring this property from satellite is one important source of data, but it does require making some assumptions. This study evaluates the accuracy of satellite-derived drop concentration by comparing to aircraft measurements. 
 Cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) can be retrieved through passive satellite observation. These retrievals are useful due to their wide spatial and temporal coverage. However, the accuracy of the retrieved values is not well understood. In this paper, we compare satellite Nd derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument with in situ aircraft measurements using a phase Doppler interferometer onboard three flight campaigns sampling marine stratocumulus clouds. Intercomparison of Nd values shows that the discrepancy between retrieved and in situ Nd can be ±50 % or more. In the mean, there is evidence of an overestimation bias by MODIS retrievals, although the sample size is insufficient for statistical certainty. We find that MODIS Nd is best interpreted as representative of the mid-cloud region, as there is almost always a greater discrepancy from in situ values near cloud top and cloud base. We also find evidence of cases where Nd is accurately retrieved, but effective radius is not, presumably due to offsetting errors in other retrieval parameters. Vertical profiles of extinction coefficient β, liquid water content L, and effective radius re measured during sawtooth-pattern flight legs through cloud top are also compared to implicit MODIS retrieval profiles. For the one case with Nd agreement, all profiles match well. For seven cases with significant disagreement, there is no consistent underlying cause. The discrepancy originates from either: (a) discrepancy in the re profile, (b) discrepancy in the β and L profiles, or (c) discrepancy in both."

Here we present an annual series (2019–2022) of summer digital elevation models (PRODEMs) for the Greenland Ice Sheet margin, covering all outlet glaciers from the ice sheet. The PRODEMs are based on fusion of CryoSat-2 radar altimetry and ICESat-2 laser altimetry. With their high spatial and temporal resolution, the PRODEMs will enable detailed studies of the changes in marginal ice sheet elevations. 
 Surface topography across the marginal zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet is constantly evolving in response to changing weather, season, climate, and ice dynamics. However, current digital elevation models (DEMs) for the ice sheet are usually based on data from a multi-year period, thus obscuring these changes over time. Here we present four 500 m resolution summer DEMs (PRODEMs) of the Greenland Ice Sheet marginal zone for 2019 through 2022. The PRODEMs cover the marginal zone from the ice edge to 50 km inland, hence capturing all Greenland outlet glaciers. Each PRODEM is based on data fusion of CryoSat-2 radar altimetry and ICESat-2 laser altimetry using regionally varying kriging of elevation anomalies relative to ArcticDEM. The PRODEMs are validated using leave-one-out cross-validation, and PRODEM19 is further validated against an external data set, showcasing their ability to correctly represent surface elevations within the associated spatially varying prediction uncertainties. We observe a general lowering of surface elevations during the 4-year PRODEM period, but the spatial pattern of change is highly complex and with annual changes superimposed. The PRODEMs enable detailed studies of the marginal ice sheet elevation changes. With their high spatio-temporal resolution, the PRODEMs will be of value to a wide range of researchers and users studying ice sheet dynamics and monitoring how the ice sheet responds to changing environmental conditions. PRODEMs from summer 2019 through 2022 are available at https://doi.org/10.22008/FK2/52WWHG (Winstrup, 2024), and we plan to annually update the product henceforth."

We developed a global 30 m 23-year (2000–2022) daily seamless data cube (SDC) of surface reflectance based on Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 and MODIS products. The SDC exhibits enhanced capabilities for monitoring land cover changes and robust consistency in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which are important for global environmental monitoring. 
 The Landsat series constitutes an unparalleled repository of multi-decadal Earth observations, serving as a cornerstone in global environmental monitoring. However, the inconsistent coverage of Landsat data due to its long revisit intervals and frequent cloud cover poses significant challenges to land monitoring over large geographical extents. In this study, we developed a full-chain processing framework for the multi-sensor data fusion of Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 and MODIS Terra surface reflectance products. Based on this framework a global 30 m resolution daily seamless data cube (SDC) of land surface reflectance was generated, spanning from 2000 to 2022. A thorough evaluation of the SDC was undertaken using a leave-one-out approach and a cross-comparison with NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) products. The leave-one-out validation at 425 global test sites assessed the agreement between the SDC with actual Landsat surface reflectance values (not used as input), revealing an overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.014 (the valid range of surface reflectance values is 0–1). The cross-comparison with HLS products at 22 Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiles revealed an overall mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.017 with L30 (Landsat 8-based 30 m HLS product) and a MAD of 0.021 with S30 (Sentinel-2-based 30 m HLS product). Moreover, experimental results underscore the advantages of employing the SDC for global land cover classification, achieving a sizable improvement in overall accuracy (2.4 %–11.3 %) over that obtained using Landsat composite and interpolated datasets.

Here we construct a global database on actual nitrogen loss rates, covering over 30 years of observations, measured in coastal and marine sediments. This work provides a global overview of the biogeography and potential controlling factors of denitrification and anammox, and highlights the potential applications of this database. 
 Denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) convert reactive nitrogen to invert N2, and play vital roles in nitrogen removal in coastal and marine ecosystems, weakening the adverse effects caused by terrestrial excessive nitrogen inputs. Given the importance of denitrification and anammox in nitrogen cycle, lots of studies has measured denitrification and anammox through intact core incubations across different systems, and nitrogen loss processes are affected by a series of environmental factors such as organic carbon, nitrate, dissolved oxygen and temperature. However, a global synthesis of actual nitrogen loss rates is lacking and how environmental factors regulate nitrogen loss remains unclear. Therefore, we have compiled a database of nitrogen loss rates, including denitrification and anammox in coastal and marine systems from published literatures. This database includes 473, 466, and 255 measurements for total nitrogen loss denitrification and anammox, respectively. This work deepens our understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of denitrification, anammox and the relative contribution of anammox to total nitrogen loss and their corresponding environmental controls. To our knowledge, the constructed database for the first time offers a comprehensive overview of actual nitrogen loss rates in coastal and marine ecosystems on a global scale. This database can be utilized to compare nitrogen loss rates of different regions, identify the key factors regulating these rates, and parameterize biogeochemical models in the future.

The model was developed using multi-directional mean sea surface data, providing detailed coverage of ocean gravity variations at a 1'×1' resolution. Freely available on Zenodo, SDUST2023VGGA serves as a valuable dataset for marine geophysics and oceanography research, offering insights into seafloor structures and ocean mass distribution. 
 Satellite altimetry is a vital tool for global ocean observation, providing critical insights into ocean gravity and its gradient. Over the past six years, satellite data from various space agencies have nearly tripled, facilitating the development of high-precision ocean gravity anomaly and ocean vertical gradient of gravity anomaly (VGGA) models. This study constructs a global ocean VGGA model named SDUST2023VGGA using multi-directional mean sea surface data. To address computational resource limitations, the global ocean is divided into ten sub-regions. In each sub-region, the DTU21 Mean Sea Surface (MSS) model and the CNES-CLS22 Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) model are used to derive the geoid. To mitigate the influence of long-wavelength signals on the calculations, the study subtracts the long-wavelength geoid derived from the XGM2019e gravity field model from the original geoid, resulting in a residual geoid (short-wavelength). To ensure the accuracy of the VGGA calculations, a weighted least-squares method is employed using residual geoid data from a 17′ × 17′ area surrounding the computation point. This approach effectively accounts for the actual ocean environment, thereby enhancing the precision of the calculation results. After combining the VGGA models for all sub-regions, the model's reliability is validated against the SIO V32.1 VGGA (named curv) model. The comparison between the VGGA and the SIO V32.1 model shows a mean of -0.08 Eötvös (E) and an RMS of 8.50 E, indicating a high degree of consistency across the global scale. Analysis of the differences reveals that the advanced data processing and modeling strategies employed in the DTU21 MSS model enable SDUST2023VGGA to maintain stable performance across varying ocean depths, unaffected by ocean dynamics. The effective use of multi-directional mean sea surface data allows for the detailed capture of ocean gravity field information embedded in the MSS model. Analysis across diverse ocean regions demonstrates that the SDUST2023VGGA model successfully reveals the internal structure and mass distribution of the seafloor.

 We describe an idealized Southern Ocean model (ISOM 1.0) that contains simplified iconic topographic features in the Southern Ocean and conduct a fully mesoscale-resolving simulation with the horizontal resolution of 2 km, based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model. The model obtains a fully developed and vigorous mesoscale eddying field with a k−3 eddy kinetic energy spectrum and captures the topographic effect on stratification and large-scale flow. To make a natural introduction of large eddy simulation (LES) methods to ocean mesoscale parameterization, we propose the concept of mesoscale ocean direct numerical simulation (MODNS). A qualified MODNS dataset should resolve the first baroclinic deformation radius and ensure that the affected scales by the dissipation schemes are sufficiently smaller than the radius. Such datasets can serve as the benchmark for a priori and a posteriori tests of LES schemes or mesoscale ocean large eddy simulation (MOLES) methods in ocean general circulation models. The 2 km simulation can meet the requirement of MODNS and also capture submesoscale effects. Therefore, its output can be a type of MODNS and provide reliable data support for relevant a priori and a posteriori tests. We demonstrate the diversity of multiscale eddy interactions, validate the crucial role of mesoscale-related strain in submesoscale processes, and uncover the bridge effect of submesoscale processes between mesoscale entities and in the eddy–jet interaction. In addition, we use the model to conduct multipassive tracer experiments and reveal guidelines for the initial settings of passive tracers to delay the homogenization process and ensure the mutual independence of tracers over a long period."

To facilitate the application of GNNWR and GTNNWR in addressing spatiotemporal nonstationary processes, the Python-based package GNNWR has been developed. This article details the implementation of these models and introduces the GNNWR package, enabling users to efficiently apply these cutting-edge techniques. Validation of the package is conducted through two case studies. The first case involves the verification of GNNWR using air quality data from China, while the second employs offshore dissolved silicate concentration data from Zhejiang Province to validate GTNNWR.

In this study, Fe-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanomaterials were used to construct Fe–Nx sites, and the electronic structure was tuned by boron nitride quantum dots (BNQDs), thereby optimizing PAA activation for the degradation of antibiotics. The BNQDs-modified Fe-doped g-C3N4 catalyst (BNQDs-FCN) achieved an excellent reaction rate constant of 0.0843 min–1, marking a 21.6-fold improvement over the carbon nitride (CN)-based PAA system. DFT calculations further corroborate the superior adsorption capacity of the Fe–Nx sites for PAA, facilitating its activation. Charge transfer mechanisms, with PAA serving as an electron acceptor, were identified as the source of high-valent iron-oxo species. Moreover, the BNQDs-FCN system preferentially targets oxygen-containing functional groups in antibiotic structures, elucidating the selective attack patterns of these highly electrophilic species.

These phenolic compounds can undergo oxidation by nitrate radicals (NO3) to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Viscosity and hygroscopicity are key properties that affect SOA’s role in atmospheric chemistry, air quality, climate and public health. However, these properties have not been quantified for SOA formed from the reaction of phenolic compounds with NO3. We used the poke-flow technique and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to measure the viscosity and hygroscopicity of SOA particles generated from the reaction of NO3 with guaiacol, termed guaiacol-NO3 SOA. The viscosity of this SOA is extremely high (≳5 × 107 Pa s) at RH ≲ 70% and drastically higher than other SOA types previously  investigated with the poke-flow technique at RH ≳ 40%. The high viscosity for guaiacol-NO3 SOA can be attributed, at least in part, to the low hygroscopicity measured via the QCM. From the viscosity results, we calculated the mixing times of organic molecules within guaiacol-NO3 SOA. The results suggest that mixing times within this type of SOA exceed 1 h for most tropospheric conditions, with possible implications for predicting the size, mass, and long-range transport of pollutants in phenolic SOA."

Mutagenicity is increased in intergenic relative to genic regions, suggesting a role for transcription-coupled repair of BbF-induced DNA damage. At higher doses, the maximum mutagenic response to BbF is higher in liver, which has a lower mitotic index but higher metabolic capacity than BM; however, mutagenic potency is comparable between the two tissues. BbF induces primarily C:G > A:T mutations, followed by C:G > T:A and C:G > G:C, indicating that BbF metabolites mainly target guanines and cytosines.

A high-resolution three-dimensional physical–biogeochemical coupled model, validated against observational data from three summer cruises in 2020, accurately captured key drivers of hypoxia. Results reveal that hypoxic zones exhibit an uneven distribution, driven by persistent offshore jets at specific locations. Nearshore deployment of oxygenation devices upstream of hypoxic zones significantly improves oxygen delivery and is more cost-efficient due to reduced construction and maintenance requirements. Uncertainty analysis explored the impacts of varying water mass properties, oxygen concentration, injection flow rates, and biogeochemical content. The influence varies depending on the deployment site. Particularly, buoyant plumes can notably reduce the effectiveness of hypoxia mitigation. Artificial oxygenation may lead to unintended ecological impacts, including increased nutrient release and enhanced primary production, which can prolong the duration of hypoxia.

We quantified water scarcity risks and resilience at the city level, since fine-grained studies can better capture the highly varied water resource availability, demand and socio-economic development across China. To do this, we used an income-based multiregional input-output approach between 2007 and 2017, which allows the economic impacts of water scarcity along supply chains to be comprehensively assessed. The results show that supply chains amplify potential local economic risks by three times nationally, with the amplification effect reaching ten times in some cities. The resilience to water scarcity, taking into account multiple dimensions including the impact of physical water transfer, varies across different cities and is negatively correlated to water scarcity risks.

With the biotic reduction of ferrihydrite and Fe(II) production, Mo(VI) reduction and Mo(IV)O2 formation were observed for the first time, which further immobilized Mo after surface adsorption of Mo(VI). At low Mo levels (Mo/Fe molar ratios of 1–2%), sufficient Fe(II) adsorption onto ferrihydrite resulted in its transformation into magnetite nanoparticles (>80%, ∼25 nm), which catalyzed the reduction of Mo(VI) to form Mo(IV)O2 and immobilized Mo. Contrastingly, at high Mo concentrations (Mo/Fe molar ratios of 5–10%), Mo(VI)O42– adsorption onto ferrihydrite limited Fe(II) adsorption; subsequently, less magnetite (<8–12%) formed while more goethite (∼30–50%, width and length >15 and 100 nm, respectively) and siderite (∼20–30%, width and length >100 and 200 nm, respectively) with larger particle sizes formed instead, causing Mo(VI) release due to lower Mo adsorption. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the interaction mechanisms among Geobacter sulfurreducens, Mo(VI), and iron oxyhydroxides, enabling predictions and controls of long-term Mo mobility and Fe mineral transformation under a variety of biogeochemical scenarios."

Here, we show an integrated underway observation of oceanic and atmospheric NO and NO2 from the coastal seas to the open ocean in the northwestern Pacific Ocean (NWPO). The concentrations of NO and NO2 showed similar distribution patterns that the coastal seas with rich nitrogen nutrients showed higher levels, like the Yellow Sea (7.6 and 19.9 pmol L–1) and the East China Sea (11.8 and 23.3 pmol L–1), while the oligotrophic sea and open ocean showed decreased levels, like the South China Sea (2.4 pmol L–1 and below the detection limit, LOD) and the NWPO (3.5 pmol L–1 and below the LOD). Apart from nitrogen nutrients, sea surface temperature might be another important influencing factor on the NO and NO2 distribution. In the surface water (<10 m), photoproduction was a major NO source compared to the microbial process, while in the mixed layer, the microbial process played a more critical role. The saturation values showed that the sea was a net source of atmospheric NO but was a net sink of NO2."

However, the contribution of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation and the driving environmental factors remain unclear, especially on large scales. Here, we utilized biogeochemical and genome-resolved metagenomic profiling, assisted by machine learning analysis, to estimate the contributions of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation and to predict the key environmental factors driving this process in soils from five distinct ecosystems. The results showed that phylogenetically and physiologically diverse H2 and CO oxidizers and chemosynthetic carbon-fixing microbes are present in the soil in different terrestrial ecosystems. The large-scale variations in soil carbon fixation were highly positively correlated with both the abundance and the activity of H2 and CO oxidizers (p < 0.05–0.001). Furthermore, soil pH and moisture-induced shifts in the abundance of H2 and CO oxidizers partially explained the variation in soil carbon fixation (55%). The contributions of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation in the different terrestrial ecosystems were estimated to range from 1.1% to 35.0%. The estimated rate of trace gas carbon fixation varied from 0.04 to 1.56 mg kg–1 d–1. These findings reveal that atmospheric trace gas oxidizers may contribute to soil carbon fixation driven by key soil environmental factors, highlighting the non-negligible contribution of these microbes to terrestrial carbon cycling."

Keoleian,Carbon and Energy Footprinting across Archetypes for U.S. Maple Syrup Production,"The production of maple syrup from sap requires extensive processing, which has traditionally led to significant energy inputs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per gallon produced. Technology advancements, e.g., vacuum tubing sap collection systems, reverse osmosis (RO), and electric evaporators have changed the way syrup is produced, resulting in widespread variability in processing equipment and sugar-making operational decisions. This paper evaluates these complex operations through a cradle-to-retail gate carbon footprinting model and by capturing variability in a series of producer archetypes. By isolating energy and emissions impacts, we find that implementing RO has the largest reduction effect on energy (54–77%) and emissions (57–82%), depending on both production size and evaporator fuel (wood, fuel-oil, or electricity). Results also demonstrate the effect of production scale on cumulative energy demand (CED) and emissions per gallon of syrup, with small producers ranging from 333–1,425 MJ/gal and 27–118 kg CO2e/gal (61–90% biogenic on-site) for wood-fired operations and 18–65 kg CO2e/gal for oil-fired operations.

However, since the 1970s, saltmarsh wetlands in coastal China have been seriously threatened by the invasive Spartina alterniflora. Although the Chinese government has initiated a nationwide S. alterniflora removal project, the potential benefits and risks of this project remain unknown. Here, we focus on the Yangtze River Estuary Saltmarsh Wetland (YRESW) and simulate its future ecosystem structure, function, and quality under three scenarios based on remote sensing and field investigation data. The simulation scenarios include the absence of a removal project, natural regeneration postproject (NRP), and planted restoration postproject. The results show that the removal project will reverse the escalating invasion trend of S. alterniflora in the YRESW. Compared to the baseline year of 2022, there is a remarkable increase in ecosystem structure (composition: +107%, configuration: +27%) and ecosystem quality (+10.5%) under the NRP scenario. Although blue carbon storage sharply decreases under both scenarios involving project implementation, planted restoration can restore YRESW’s carbon sequestration capacity to 0.19 Tg C per year, achieving 87% of the carbon storage present before the project. This study underscores the necessity of comprehensive and detailed risk assessments in ecological projects, particularly when dominant species are involved.

However, the mechanisms of formation  of aromatic aminiums in urban aerosols remain elusive. Highly time-resolved PM2.5 samples were collected in the center of Shanghai (China) during the winter to investigate the origin and formation of aminiums. The dominant aminium groups were aliphatic (mainly dimethylaminium and monomethylaminium). Anilinium was the third most abundant aminium. The concentrations of anilinium and total aminiums showed higher levels during the daytime and on weekdays. This finding combined with source apportionment analysis suggested that the daily and weekly scale variations of anthropogenic activities (e.g., traffic for commuting) were mainly responsible for the fluctuations in aminium concentrations (particularly aromatic aminiums). The acid dependence of aliphatic aminium formation was significantly stronger than that of aromatic aminium formation. Aliphatic and aromatic aminiums were significantly negatively and positively correlated with ozone, respectively, suggesting that the oxidative processes weakened the abundance of aliphatic aminiums but promoted the formation of aromatic aminiums. The molecular characterization of aromatic aminiums suggested that the atmospheric degradation of higher-molecular-weight aromatic amine compounds was an important mechanism for anilinium formation in urban aerosols. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the formation of  aromatic aminiums."

Ion chromatography (IC) and aerosol mass spectrometry (a mini aerosol mass spectrometer, mAMS) were used to constrain the proportions of sulfurous compounds produced under wildfire-relevant conditions ([NO2]/[O3] = 0.1). With constraints from IC, results indicated that the sulfurous particle mass consisted of 30.3 ± 6.6% SO42–, while mAMS fractionation attributed 24.5 ± 1.6% of total sulfate signal to SO42–, 15.4 ± 1.9% to organosulfates, and 60.1 ± 0.9% to sulfonates.

According to differences in alcohol-derived adducts (e.g., DMPO-CH2OH or DMPO-OCH3) while alcohol is attacked by •OH or DMPO•+, a nonradical mechanism is proposed for the BQ/DMPO system. This is further evidenced by the mass spectrometry data in which DMPO-OCH3 has been identified in BQ (or chlorinated-BQ)/DMPO systems. 17O incorporation experiments verify that hydroxyl oxygen in DMPO-OH originates from water. The DMPO-OH adduct might be formed via direct oxidation and water substitution or one-electron oxidation and nucleophilic addition.

This study used the primary murine olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) as an in vitro model to explore the translocation mechanism of PM2.5 in the olfactory system. We found that PM2.5 can be internalized into the OSNs via vesicle transportation. This process responds only to the water-insoluble compositions of PM2.5 (WIS-PM2.5) and cannot be affected by the water-soluble compositions of PM2.5 (WS-PM2.5). PM2.5 can further disrupt the integrity of the barrier constituted by the OSNs, and WS-PM2.5 plays a heightened role in inducing the damages.

Magmatic processes at the crust‐mantle boundary (i.e., Moho) are commonly studied post facto at fossil ophiolites, oceanic core complexes, or inferred from the compositions of crystals or melt inclusions. The 2021 eruption at Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland, was supplied from magma bodies near the Moho and offers a unique opportunity to study the timescales, structure, and syn‐eruptive processes of near‐Moho magmatic systems at ∼15 km depth. Here, we present a comprehensive petrological and geochemical investigation of the full 183 day eruption that is based on frequent sampling of the eruption. Lavas erupted in the first 45 days displayed significant and sudden changes in geochemistry, followed by lower amplitude fluctuations until the end of the eruption. This variability can be explained by contribution from multiple magma bodies, as best distinguished using Sr‐Nd‐Hf‐Pb isotope systematics. The lavas display unusual trace element and radiogenic isotope compositions compared to other Icelandic basalts, but are similar to other rare, highly incompatible element enriched lavas on the Reykjanes Peninsula, and thus these lavas may represent a distinct suite of Reykjanes Peninsula basalts. Our geochemical and petrological observations show that numerous, compositionally variable bodies of magma must exist in the lowermost crust or at the crust‐mantle boundary. These near‐Moho magma bodies transfer magma between one another on timescales as short as days‐to‐months, but partially crystallize over longer time periods, and periodically inject into the overlying crust."

 All-inorganic perovskites prepared by substituting the organic cations (e.g. methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+)) with inorganic cations (e.g. Cs+) are effective concepts to enhance the long-term photo- and thermal-stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs)1,2.

We elucidate that LE deliberately leverages multiple roles for inorganic NBG perovskite growth and anticipate our study provides insightful guideline for developing high-efficiency and stable IPTSCs."

 The ability to flexibly switch our response to external stimuli according to contextual information is critical for successful interactions with a complex world. Context-dependent computations are necessary across many domains1–3, yet their neural implementations remain poorly understood. Here we developed a novel behavioral task in rats to study context-dependent selection and accumulation of evidence for decision-making4−6. Under assumptions supported by both monkey and rat data, we first show mathematically that this computation can be supported by three dynamical solutions, and all networks performing the task implement a combination of these solutions. These solutions can be identified and tested directly with experimental data. We further show that existing electrophysiological and modeling data are compatible with the full variety of possible combinations of these solutions, suggesting that different individuals could use different combinations. To study variability across individual subjects, we developed automated, high-throughput methods to train rats on our task, and we trained many subjects on it. Consistent with theoretical predictions, neural and behavioral analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity across rats, despite uniformly good task performance. Our theory further predicts a specific link between behavioral and neural signatures, which was robustly supported in the data. In summary, our results provide a new experimentally-supported theoretical framework to analyze individual variability in biological and artificial systems performing flexible decision-making tasks, they open the door to cellular-resolution studies of individual variability in higher cognition, and they provide insights into neural mechanisms of context-dependent computation more generally.

 Quantum scars refer to eigenstates with enhanced probability density along unstable classical periodic orbits. First predicted 40 years ago1, scars are special eigenstates that counterintuitively defy ergodicity in quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic2,3. Despite the importance and long history of scars, their direct visualization in quantum systems remains an open field4–10. Here we demonstrate that, by using an in situ graphene quantum dot (GQD) creation and a wavefunction mapping technique11,12, quantum scars are imaged for Dirac electrons with nanometre spatial resolution and millielectronvolt energy resolution with a scanning tunnelling microscope. Specifically, we find enhanced probability densities in the form of lemniscate ∞-shaped and streak-like patterns within our stadium-shaped GQDs. Both features show equal energy interval recurrence, consistent with predictions for relativistic quantum scars13,14. By combining classical and quantum simulations, we demonstrate that the observed patterns correspond to two unstable periodic orbits that exist in our stadium-shaped GQD, thus proving that they are both quantum scars. In addition to providing unequivocal visual evidence of quantum scarring, our work offers insight into the quantum–classical correspondence in relativistic chaotic quantum systems and paves the way to experimental investigation of other recently proposed scarring species such as perturbation-induced scars15–17, chiral scars18,19 and antiscarring20.

 Despite the fundamental role of bacterial strain variation in gut microbiota function1–6, the number of unique strains of a species that can stably colonize the human intestine is still unknown for almost all species. Here we determine the strain richness (SR) of common gut species using thousands of sequenced bacterial isolates with paired metagenomes. We show that SR varies across species, is transferable by faecal microbiota transplantation, and is uniquely low in the gut compared with soil and lake environments. Active therapeutic administration of supraphysiologic numbers of strains per species increases recipient SR, which then converges back to the population average after dosing is ceased. Stratifying engraftment outcomes by high or low SR shows that SR predicts microbial addition or replacement in faecal transplants. Together, these results indicate that properties of the gut ecosystem govern the number of strains of each species colonizing the gut and thereby influence strain addition and replacement in faecal microbiota transplantation and defined live biotherapeutic products. Strain richness of gut microbiota ecosystems is a key characteristic underpinning engraftment in faecal microbiota transplantation, and could improve the design of defined live biotherapeutic products with predictable outcomes."

 The Southern Ocean, a region highly vulnerable to climate change, plays a vital role in regulating global nutrient cycles and atmospheric CO2 via the biological carbon pump. Diatoms, photosynthetically active plankton with dense opal skeletons, are key to this process as their exoskeletons are thought to enhance the transfer of particulate organic carbon to depth, positioning them as major vectors of carbon storage. Yet conflicting observations obscure the mechanistic link between diatoms, opal and particulate organic carbon fluxes, especially in the twilight zone where greatest flux losses occur. Here we present direct springtime flux measurements from different sectors of the subpolar Southern Ocean, demonstrating that across large areas of the subpolar twilight zone, carbon is efficiently transferred to depth, albeit not by diatoms. Rather, opal is retained near the surface ocean, indicating that processes such as diatom buoyancy regulation and grazer repackaging can negate ballast effects of diatoms’ skeletons. Our results highlight that the presence of diatoms in surface waters of the Southern Ocean’s largest biome does not guarantee their importance as vectors for efficient carbon transfer through the subpolar twilight zone. Climate change-driven shifts in phytoplankton community composition may affect biologically sequestered carbon pools less than currently predicted.

 Lung tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells induced by influenza vaccination are crucial for heterosubtypic immunity upon re-exposure to the influenza virus, enabling rapid and robust responses upon reactivation. To enhance the efficacy of influenza vaccines, we induce the generation of lung TRM cells following intranasal vaccination with a commercial influenza vaccine adjuvanted with NexaVant (NVT), a TLR3 agonist-based adjuvant. We demonstrate that intranasal immunization with the NVT-adjuvanted vaccine provides improved protection against influenza virus infections by inducing the generation of CD4+ TRM cells in the lungs in a type I interferon-dependent manner. These pulmonary CD4+ TRM cells provide potent mucosal immunity and cross-protection against heterosubtypic infections in both mouse and ferret models.

 Paediatric medulloblastomas with chromothripsis are characterised by high genomic instability and are among the tumours with the worst prognosis. However, the molecular makeup and the determinants of the aggressiveness of chromothriptic medulloblastoma are not well understood. Here, we apply spatial transcriptomics to profile a cohort of 13 chromothriptic and non-chromothriptic medulloblastomas from the same molecular subgroup. Our data reveal a higher extent of spatial intra-tumour heterogeneity in chromothriptic medulloblastomas compared to non-chromothripictic tumours, which is associated with increased proliferation and stemness, but lower immune infiltration and differentiation. Spatial mapping of genetic subclones of the same tumour identify a regionally distinct architecture and clone-specific phenotypic features, with distinct degrees of differentiation, proliferation and immune infiltration between clones. We conduct temporal profiling of 11 samples from patient-derived xenografts from a patient with chromothriptic medulloblastoma, covering the transition from the minimal residual disease stage to treatment-resistant regrown tumours. In chromothriptic medulloblastoma, an ecosystem of cells from multiple genetic clones resist treatment and lead to relapse.

Here, Aboy et al. describe CAV1 Y14 phosphorylation as required for appropriate adipocyte caveolae flattening and homeostasis. 
 Adipocytes expand massively to accommodate excess energy stores and protect the organism from lipotoxicity. Adipose tissue expandability is at the center of disorders such as obesity and lipodystrophy; however, little is known about the relevance of adipocyte biomechanics on the etiology of these conditions. Here, we show in male mice in vivo that the adipocyte plasma membrane undergoes caveolar domain reorganization upon lipid droplet expansion. As the lipid droplet grows, caveolae disassemble to release their membrane reservoir and increase cell surface area, and transfer specific caveolar components to the LD surface. Adipose tissue null for caveolae is stiffer, shows compromised deformability, and is prone to rupture under mechanical compression. Mechanistically, phosphoacceptor Cav1 Tyr14 is required for caveolae disassembly: adipocytes bearing a Tyr14Phe mutation at this residue are stiffer and smaller, leading to decreased adiposity in vivo; exhibit deficient transfer of Cav1 and EHD2 to the LD surface, and show distinct Cav1 molecular dynamics and tension adaptation. These results indicate that Cav1 phosphoregulation modulates caveolar dynamics as a relevant component of the homeostatic mechanoadaptation of the differentiated adipocyte.

Here, the authors show that it is possible to use a scanning tunnelling microscope to measure and influence the outcome of a single-molecule reaction with multiple competing outcomes. 
 Programming matter one molecule at a time is a long-standing goal in nanoscience. The atomic resolution of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) can give control over the probability of inducing single-outcome single-molecule reactions. Here we show it is possible to measure and influence the outcome of a single-molecule reaction with multiple competing outcomes. By precise injection of electrons from an STM tip, toluene molecules are induced to react with two outcomes: switching to an adjacent site or desorption. Within a voltage range set by the electronic structure of the molecule-surface system, we see that the branching ratio between these two outcomes is dependent on the excess energy the exciting electron carries. Using known values, ab initio DFT calculations and empirical models, we conclude that this excess energy leads to a heating of a common intermediate physisorbed state and gives control over the two outcomes via their energy barriers and prefactors.

 The stereoselectivity of enzymes plays a central role in asymmetric biocatalytic reactions, but there remains a dearth of evolution-driven biochemistry studies investigating the evolutionary trajectory of this vital property. Imine reductases (IREDs) are one such enzyme that possesses excellent stereoselectivity, and stereocomplementary members are pervasive in the family. However, the regulatory mechanism behind stereocomplementarity remains cryptic. Herein, we reconstruct a panel of active ancestral IREDs and trace the evolution of stereoselectivity from ancestors to extant IREDs. Combined with coevolution analysis, we reveal six historical mutations capable of recapitulating stereoselectivity evolution. An investigation of the mechanism with X-ray crystallography shows that they collectively reshape the substrate-binding pocket to regulate stereoselectivity inversion. In addition, we construct an empirical fitness landscape and discover that epistasis is prevalent in stereoselectivity evolution. Our findings emphasize the power of ASR in circumventing the time-consuming large-scale mutagenesis library screening for identifying mutations that change functions and support a Darwinian premise from a molecular perspective that the evolution of biological functions is a stepwise process.

 This paper addresses the challenge of indoor space segmentation from 3D point clouds, which is essential for understanding interior layouts, reconstructing 3D structures, and developing indoor navigation maps. While current deep learning-based methods rely on projecting 3D point clouds into 2D for instance extraction, they often fail to capture the local and global 3D features necessary for effectively segmenting complex indoor spaces, such as multi-ring nested structures. These methods also struggle with generalization across different scenes. In response, this paper proposes an efficient indoor space segmentation method that integrates both 2D and 3D geometric constraints. By leveraging the distribution characteristics of point clouds in 2D and the local and global features in 3D, the method achieves reliable extraction of vertical structural information in complex indoor environments. To address under-segmentation in small spaces due to varying scales, the paper introduces an adaptive extraction method for space partition anchors, guided by local features. During instance-level space segmentation, a hierarchical contour tree structure is employed to precisely partition complex indoor spaces, effectively handling circular and composite structures. The proposed approach was tested on 96 RGB-D scans from the Beike dataset and 6 large-scale indoor scenes from the S3DIS dataset, covering a range of complexities, sizes, and structures. The experimental section includes ablation studies and thorough comparisons with existing state-of-the-art spatial partitioning algorithms based on morphology and deep learning. Results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability, providing a solid foundation for indoor space modeling and robotic navigation.

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) retrieval from remote sensing imagery is essential for monitoring vegetation growth and stress in the agroforestry industry. Many remote sensing inversion methods for estimating LCC primarily rely on 1D radiative transfer models (RTMs) that abstract canopies into horizontal layers or simple geometric primitives. Yet, this methodology faces challenges when applied to heterogeneous canopies, particularly in fine-scale mapping where each pixel's reflectance is significantly influenced by its surroundings, e.g. crown shadows. While 3D RTMs hold promise for addressing these challenges by explicitly describing complex canopy structures, their computational demands and the complexity involved in parameterizing detailed 3D structures limit the generation of extensive training datasets, requiring simulations across numerous parameter combinations. In this study, we used a semi-empirically accelerated 3D RTM, termed Semi-LESS, with a 1D residual network to accurately retrieve leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) from UAV images and LiDAR data at a 3-m resolution. We first reconstructed structures of forest plots using UAV LiDAR point cloud, based on which, UAV images with varying leaf and soil optical properties are simulated using the Semi-LESS. Subsequently, a training dataset consisting LCC and its corresponding reflectance was generated from the simulated UAV images by focusing on sunlit pixels. A 1D residual network is trained using the training dataset for LCC estimation. For comparison, we also trained an estimation model using a dataset generated from PROSAIL. The results show that estimation model trained with Semi-LESS surpasses PROSAIL in retrieving LCC from both simulation datasets and field measurements of two forest plots. The RMSE of Semi-LESS was 5.40–6.92 µg/cm2 for simulation datasets and 8.21–9.76 µg/cm2 for field measurements, whereas PROSAIL exhibited lower accuracy with an RMSE of 7.76–9.83 µg/cm2 for simulation datasets and 12.76–13.06 µg/cm2 in field measurements. The results demonstrate that Semi-LESS coupled with deep learning is reliable and has great potential for LCC mapping using UAV images, which is particularly useful for fine-scale applications such as crop and orchard monitoring. This approach also highlights the impact of shadows on LCC retrieval."

 Accurate bathymetric data is crucial for various aspects such as marine resource exploitation and marine ecological conservation. Currently, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) based on empirical and physical models has been widely utilized in constructing underwater terrain in shallow seas. However, the application of such SDB models is limited in remote island reef areas lacking in-situ measurement data. To overcome this issue, the manuscript proposes an unconstrained SDB optimization method without in-situ measurement data, utilizing satellite multispectral imagery (Geoeye-1) and spaceborne LiDAR data (ICESat-2). By classifying the seafloor substrate in coral reef areas into sandy and coral, based on the depth invariant index (DII), we employ an adaptive logarithmic ratio model for unconstrained SDB. The ICESat-2 LiDAR data are then used to correct the SDB results, achieving bathymetry optimization in the coral reef area of the Xisha Islands. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to Yuanzhi Island of the Xisha Islands, and the accuracy of the bathymetric results is evaluated against ALB (Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry) data. The findings demonstrate that compared to conventional methods, our method can improve the accuracy of SDB results with good adaptability. In the Yuanzhi Island area, the proposed method yields SDB results with an R2 of 0.93, an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 0.94, and an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 1.12 m, compared to ALB data. The average error is less than 10 % of the maximum depth, essentially meeting the requirements of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) standards for depth measurement error when depth is <20 m. This study can offer a novel approach for enhancing bathymetric accuracy around offshore and remote islands, where gathering underwater terrain data is challenging."

 Climate change caused by rapid urbanization in the Guanzhong region of China is becoming an increasingly significant problem. Previous empirical studies have confirmed that landscape patterns inextricably linked with the thermal environment, but static results based on a single temporal cross section of image data provide only a partial understanding. In this paper, we constructed a dynamic framework using Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) for temperature simulation and Geodetector to study the landscape factors and their interactions that influence near-surface temperature (NST) changes in the Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA) between 2000 and 2020. Results showed that the GPUA average NST increased by 0.012 °C and 0.053 °C in January and July from 2000 to 2020, respectively. In terms of the dynamic correlation between landscape patterns and NST, cropland (CPL) was negative, urban land (UBL) was positive, and the remainder of the landscapes differed in winter and summer. Furthermore, results from the Geodetector showed that UBL embodied a stronger influence in summer than during winter months. This finding helps to explain why the average NST increase is higher in summer than during winter. The Dynamic Q values (DQ) of the area-based landscape metrics were generally larger than those of other spatial configuration metrics, and the interaction results showed that the landscape metrics of various land-cover classifications were enhanced, indicating that the superposition effect among landscape metrics needs to be taken into account in landscape planning in addition to area factors. The study of the relationship between landscape patterns and thermal environment considering dynamic perspective using WRF offers an important theoretical reference allied with practical guidance for understanding and adapting to forthcoming change in our climate through which we can help drive sustainable development decisions of the GPUA."

Prior studies mostly concentrated on the heatwaves occurring in specific regions by examining temperature durations, ignoring the fact that heatwaves typically swept across a large area. To comprehensively assess the effects of heatwaves, we jointly analyzed public attention to heatwaves using a dataset of over 10 million geo-located Weibo tweets across 321 cities in China. By considering spatial disparities, two kinds of public attention at city level, namely the number of heat-related tweets (NHTs) and the ratio of heat-related tweets (RHTs), were designed to indicate the severity and location of heatwave impacts, respectively. The heat cumulative intensity was used as a proxy for heatwaves, which exhibited more significant correlations with RHTs than NHTs. The multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was employed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of environment, demographic, and economic-social factors.

 Population growth and agricultural intensification lead to stress on landscapes that are highly sensitive to land-use changes. An increase in irrigation-triggered landslides (ITL) in dry climates has negative impacts on local communities. However, evolution and global impacts of ITL are little-known. Here, we use Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR), vectorization, and differential method to study surface deformation, ground displacement, and changes in headscarp morphology and topography in regions prone to ITL, aiming to uncover the evolution and spatiotemporal distribution of ITL. Findings show that the most severe surface deformation of ITL occurs on the landslide body. Meanwhile, the ITL displacement curve indicates the ITL will maintain continuous movement for at least 7 years, while ancient ITL also poses a threat. Moreover, the headscarp of ITL shows lateral expansion and longitudinal retrogression on the horizontal ground, whereby the scale of expansion is greater than that of retrogression, which transforms landslides into landslide clusters. Finally, the topographic changes further reveal that the main development pattern of ITL is lateral expansion. We suggest that the frequency and disaster-causing ability of ITL will increase greatly with further population growth and related intensification in the agricultural sector."

 3D mapping provides highly accurate environmental data, which is essential for critical applications such as autonomous driving and urban emergency response. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, particularly solid-state ones, play a pivotal role in spatial–temporal mapping by providing precise three-dimensional data of the environment, significantly enhancing remote sensing capabilities and adaptability to challenging environments compared to mechanical LiDAR systems. However, the limited field of view results in a sparse point cloud frame with few features, which poses challenges to feature matching, causes pose offset, and hinders spatial–temporal continuity, and further significant obstacle for existing vehicle-mounted mobile mapping methods. To address the above issues, we proposed a novel approach that integrating inertial measurement unit (IMU) with solid-state LiDAR. Specifically, it comprises two key modules: an initial localization mapping module, mitigating the limitations of solid-state LiDAR in positioning and mapping accuracy, and an attitude optimization mapping module utilizing real-time high-frequency IMU data to identify key frames for correcting initial attitudes and generating accurate 3D maps. The effectiveness of the method is validated through extensive experiments in complex community and high-speed urban road scenarios.

 Accurate crop mapping is critical for agricultural decisions and food security. Despite the widespread use of machine learning and deep learning in remote sensing for crop classification, mapping crops in mountainous smallholder farming systems remains challenging. In particular, cloudy and rainy weather limits high-quality satellite imagery, potentially limiting the availability of reliable data for classification. Additionally, the substantial intraclass variability among multiple crops further impedes classification accuracy. In this context, this study sought to resolve these two issues by applying a hybrid approach that combines multisource remote sensing data and deep metric learning. For the first challenge, multisource remote sensing data, including Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data from the Google Earth Engine, were integrated to provide more comprehensive information on crop growth and differences. To address the second challenge, we proposed a 2D-CNN network enhanced by CBAM attention and an online hard example mining strategy. The network focuses on the channel-spatial information of crop samples and their surrounding pixels while promoting the convergence of similar crop samples within the latent feature space and enhancing the separation among different samples. This process is exemplified through a case study of crop mapping in Jiangjin District, Chongqing city, an area representing the typical mountain smallholder farming systems in Southwest China.

 Recently the applications of remotely sensed Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) in the study of photosynthesis, stress conditions, and gross primary production have increased significantly. The full SIF spectrum spans over a spectral region of 650 ∼ 850 nm with two characteristic peaks around 685 nm and 740 nm. Over recent decades, many retrieval algorithms have been developed to estimate SIF at Top-Of-Canopy (TOC) using in-situ measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. Although the majority of retrieval methods retrieve SIF at a narrow spectral window, there exists a potential for retrieval of SIF in the full emission spectrum. Moreover, solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra should ideally be measured at the same time but are usually measured sequentially with a certain time lag, raising potential errors in SIF retrieval. In this study, an enhanced retrieval algorithm of the full SIF spectrum at TOC is proposed. The proposed algorithm attempts to minimize the errors owing to time mismatch in measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. As an improvement to the previous algorithm (advanced Fluorescence Spectrum Reconstruction, aFSR), this proposed algorithm (aFSR-SVE) models the SIF-free contribution with principal components using the singular value decomposition technique. The optimal parameter settings in the forward model were determined for the experimental data collected by spectrometers used in the study. Firstly, the proposed algorithm was used to reconstruct full SIF spectrum for simulated data. The results were compared with known reference SIF values. After achieving satisfying results from simulated data, the proposed algorithm was compared with retrievals from established algorithms using experimental data. The results show improved SIF retrieval accuracy, without the need to simultaneously measure solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. The retrieval values comply with the results of previous algorithms in terms of spectral shape, diurnal trend, and temporal variations. The induced errors in SIF retrievals due to non-simultaneous measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra were also investigated and the proposed algorithm was found to be less prone to such errors. Hence, the proposed algorithm is an improvement in reconstructing the full SIF spectrum with near-ground measurements. With the help of the proposed algorithm, field measurements using sequential systems and automated measurements of multiple targets can be performed effectively as it relaxes the requirement of concurrent measurement of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. For future work, the applicability of this method can be investigated under more variable illumination conditions, like high cirrus clouds, passing clouds or persistent thin clouds."

 Recently, Autoencoders (AEs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection, owing to their powerful capability in handling high-dimensional data. However, they often overlook the inherent global distribution characteristics and long-range dependencies in hyperspectral images (HSI). This oversight makes it challenging to accurately characterize and describe boundaries between different backgrounds and anomalies in complex HSI, thereby affecting detection accuracy. To address this issue, a robust multi-stage progressive autoencoder for hyperspectral anomaly detection (RMSAD) is proposed. Initially, a progressive multi-stage learning framework based on convolutional autoencoders is employed. This framework incrementally reveals and integrates deep contextual features along with their long-range dependencies in HSI, aiming to accurately characterize the background and anomalies. Subsequently, an innovative multi-scale fusion strategy is introduced at the intersections of each stage, reinforcing the learning and representation of background and global spatial details across multiple stages. Finally, by collectively extracting abnormal spatial information across stages, effectively reducing the tendency of autoencoders to reconstruct anomalies. This ensures the efficient restoration and replication of global textural details in HSI. The experimental results on the six HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed RMSAD is superior to other state-of-the-art methods."

 Precise spatial mapping of individual species using hyperspectral data is crucial for effective forest management and policy-making. This study focuses on Rhododendron arboreum, known for its medicinal properties attributed to the flavonoid Quercitrin. Sample data and spectroradiometer data were collected from the complex terrain of the Kumaon region in the Himalayas. Hyperspectral data, which includes signal variations based on biophysical and biochemical properties along with noise, were preprocessed using filtering techniques to enhance signal clarity by removing noise. Smoothing techniques were applied to remove noisy bands from the spectra, such as the Savitzky-Golay filter for reduced least square fit complexity and the Average Mean filter for taking mean spectral values. Subsequently, Spectral Analysis (SA) techniques, including first derivative, second derivative, and continuum removal, were employed. These mathematical transformations highlighted absorption troughs and determined the effect of Quercitrin on spectral wavelengths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify the most relevant bands related to Quercitrin. Additionally, regression analysis was applied on resampled spectral data, selected significant wavelengths based on variable importance values, pinpointing the most prominent wavelengths: 1196, 1229, 1328, 1383, 1425, 1636, 1661, 1699, 1785, and 1715 nm. Over 50 two-band combination indices were tested, and those with p-values less than 0.05 were deemed significant. For the development of prediction model, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were applied. The Random Forest model, which splits input data into trees to simulate the best model based on observed values, demonstrated high effectiveness in predicting Quercitrin levels, achieving a training correlation of 0.864 and a testing correlation of 0.570. Hence RF proved to be a best technique of band selection as well as robust for Quercitrin prediction. This methodological approach highlights the importance of advanced data processing and analysis techniques in remote sensing applications for forest phytochemical prediction."

 Detailed knowledge of vegetation patterns allows to evaluate mire ecosystems and their dynamics. The use of hyperspectral information has the benefits of exploring spectral characteristics of species and vegetation modelling. Our study employed multi-scale and multi-source hyperspectral imaging with a handheld camera in the field and an UAV (Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle) sensor covering the wavelengths of 400 – 1000 nm. Plot-level spectra acquired with a UAV and field spectra collected at 1 m height were combined to develop a spectral library for Sphagnum moss species. This library was then used to map dominant Sphagnum species in a Finnish Aapa mire complex using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier. Classification performance assessment was supported by calculating a water index from the UAV-information. Additionally, we examined the transferability of site-specific spectral libraries to an aapa mire with similar vegetation. The results showed little spectral variation in the plot spectrum between the sensors. A fusion of species- and plot-level libraries yielded the highest accuracy of 62 %. For both mires, there was a great variation among the class accuracies. Floating mosses had an accuracy of 86 %, followed by lawn-forming Sphagnum balticum with 77 %. For the test site, the latter species was mapped with an accuracy of 59 %. Red moss species achieved low accuracies of 45 % and 38 %, likely due to effects from sub-pixel and mixed-pixel effects of neighbouring graminoid species and the presence of litter. This might have also enhanced the contrast of adjacent pixels contributing to spectral alterations. Water table depth measurements and the water index revealed a hydrological preference for most species, with classification performance notably improving with higher water index values. We recommend collecting on-site hyperspectral information at varying hydrological circumstances to build a comprehensive spectral library for mire vegetation and modelling."

 Hyperspectral imaging of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is required for plant phenotyping and stress detection. However, the most accurate instruments for SIF quantification, such as sub-nanometer (≤1-nm full-width at half-maximum, FWHM) airborne hyperspectral imagers, are expensive and uncommon. Previous studies have demonstrated that standard narrow-band hyperspectral imagers (i.e., 4–6-nm FWHM) are more cost-effective and can provide far-red SIF quantified at 760 nm (SIF760), which correlates strongly with precise sub-nanometer resolution measurements. Nevertheless, narrow-band SIF760 quantifications are subject to systematic overestimation owing to the influence of the spectral resolution (SR). In this study, we propose a modelling approach based on the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model with the objective of enhancing the accuracy of absolute SIF760 levels derived from standard airborne hyperspectral imagers in practical settings. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using airborne imagery acquired from two airborne hyperspectral imagers (FWHM ≤ 0.2-nm and 5.8-nm) flown in tandem on board an aircraft that collected data from two different wheat and maize phenotyping trials. Leaf biophysical and biochemical traits were first estimated from airborne narrow-band reflectance imagery and subsequently used as SCOPE model inputs to simulate a range of top-of-canopy (TOC) radiance and SIF spectra at 1-nm FWHM. The SCOPE simulated radiance spectra were then convolved to match the spectral configuration of the narrow-band imager to compute the 5.8-nm FWHM SIF760. A site-specific model was constructed by employing the convolved 5.8-nm SR SIF760 as the independent variable and the 1-nm SR SIF760 directly simulated by SCOPE as the dependent variable. When applied to the airborne dataset, the estimated SIF760 at 1-nm SR from the standard narrow-band hyperspectral imager matched the reference sub-nanometer quantified SIF760 with root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.5 mW/m2/nm/sr, yielding R2 = 0.93–0.95 from the two experiments. These results suggest that the proposed modelling approach enables the interpretation of SIF760 quantified using standard hyperspectral imagers of 4–6 nm FWHM for stress detection and plant physiological condition assessment."

 Confronting the escalating challenge of emergencies, the urban supply network of daily necessity is an important defense line for human well-being. This study introduces a groundbreaking approach that leverages mobile signaling data, departing from static regional data, to model large-scale and high-precision urban supply-demand network.

The model’s robustness is corroborated through simulations of major disaster scenarios. The results indicate that: 1) High-precision human mobility data promises large-scale urban supply-demand network modeling with high accuracy. 2) In regions characterized by greater vulnerability, the establishment of local supply networks demonstrates efficacy in mitigating the impacts of minor disasters. 3) During various stages of cascading failure, the leading factors contributing to community supply shortages vary, with population density being the predominant factor.

 Mapping tree crowns in arid or semi-arid areas, which cover around one-third of the Earth’s land surface, is a key methodology towards sustainable management of trees. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promising results for tree crown segmentation. However, a large amount of manually labeled data is still required. We here propose a novel method to delineate tree crowns from high resolution satellite imagery using deep learning trained with automatically generated labels from 3D radiative transfer modeling, intending to reduce human annotation significantly. The methodological steps consist of 1) simulating images with a 3D radiative transfer model, 2) image style transfer learning based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and 3) tree crown segmentation using U-net segmentation model. The delineation performances of the proposed method have been evaluated on a manually annotated dataset consisting of more than 40,000 tree crowns. Our approach, which relies solely on synthetic images, demonstrates high segmentation accuracy, with an F1 score exceeding 0.77 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) above 0.64. Particularly, it achieves impressive accuracy in extracting crown areas (r2 greater than 0.87) and crown densities (r2 greater than 0.72), comparable to that of a trained dataset with human annotations only. In this study, we demonstrated that the integration of a 3D radiative transfer model and GANs for automatically generating training labels can achieve performances comparable to human labeling, and can significantly reduce the time needed for manual labeling in remote sensing segmentation applications."

 Fusion of hyperspectral image (HSI) and multispectral image (MSI) is a prevalent scheme to generate a HSI with enhanced spatial resolution. Current methods often fail to sufficiently leverage the effective spectral and spatial priors existing in the observed HSI and MSI to further enhance the fusion performance. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel HSI-MSI fusion approach, which integrates Sparse and Low Rank with a CNN denoiser (SLRCNN) while considering spectral dictionary optimization. Firstly, an initialized spectral dictionary is derived from the HSI. Next, the spatial coefficients optimization model is established by incorporating the sparse prior, local low-rank prior, and plugged image prior simultaneously, where the l1 norm is imposed to promote the sparse prior, and the super-pixel segmentation strategy is conducted on the MSI to impose the local low-rank prior while a well-trained CNN denoiser is plugged in to enforce the image prior. Then, the spectral dictionary optimization model is constructed to refine the initial spectral dictionary, capturing more detailed spectral characteristics to further improve the fusion results. Finally, the optimization process involves applying the split-augmented Lagrangian shrinkage method and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets, namely the Pavia University dataset, the Indian Pines dataset, and the EO-1 dataset, indicate that SLRCNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches at 4x, 5x, and 6x resolutions in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results. Specifically, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of SLRCNN is improved by more than 0.9 dB, 0.9 dB, and 0.2 dB while the spectral angle mapper (SAM) is decreased by more than 0.1, 0.2, and 0.2 in degree compared to other state-of-the-art methods across three datasets, respectively, which underscores the effectiveness of SLRCNN in leveraging both spatial detail reconstruction and spectral preservation."

 Average leaf inclination angle (θ¯L) is an important canopy structure variable that influences light regime, photosynthesis, and evapotranspiration of plants. θ¯L can be measured through direct methods (e.g., protractor), which are labor-intensive and time-consuming, or through indirect optical instruments, which are more efficient than the direct methods. However, uncertainties of different indirect optical instruments for quantifying θ¯L remain largely unquantified. In this study, we evaluated and compared the performances of three major indirect optical instruments: (1) LAI-2200, (2) 30°-tilted camera, and (3) digital hemispherical photography (DHP), in different crop fields over a growing season, benchmarked with direct measurements. LAI-2200 and 30°-tilted camera showed higher agreement with direct θ¯ measurements (R2 = 0.54, RMSE = 7.37°; R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 8.08°) than DHP (R2 = 0.14, RMSE = 13.96°). Different performances of indirect optical instruments could be attributed to the accuracy of gap fraction measurement and the performance of the θ¯L quantification algorithms. When using the LAI-2200 algorithm, larger gap fraction gradients over view zenith angles led to larger θ¯L values, and smaller gap fraction gradients led to smaller θ¯L values. Such error propagation was larger in sparse canopy than in dense canopy. The Wilson G function of the LAI-2200 algorithm performed better in estimating θ¯L than the G function based on the ellipsoidal LAD function used by the CAN_EYE algorithm. We also proposed a modification of the LAI-2200 algorithm, which further improved the performance of LAI-2200 and 30°-tilted cameras in estimating θ¯L.

 Commercial districts, as the epicenters of urban commerce and economic activity, largely reflect an area’s prosperity through their customer flow. However, previous research, which often relied on statistical and survey data, has typically not captured the full scope of customer flow dynamics throughout urban commercial districts and has not adequately measured the specific impacts of business district locations and their surrounding communities on customer flow. To bridge these gaps, this study utilizes multidimensional big geo-data resources, including mobile phone signaling data, Points of Interest (POI) data, and transportation network data, to uncover the underlying factors that influence customer flow within urban commercial districts. The findings suggest that several factors—the size of the commercial district, the diversity of business formats, the convenience of parking, the working and residential population in surrounding communities, and the proximity to urban centers—significantly influence the customer flow. Consumers show a preference for larger-scale, centrally-located commercial districts that offer convenient parking options, while a homogenized and uncharacteristic business format may reduce a commercial district’s appeal. Furthermore, the study reveals that industrial parks and mixed-use complexes within the 15-minute living circle surrounding the commercial district have a stronger attraction to customer flow than residential neighborhoods do.

Firstly, we combined the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) and the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST) algorithms to identify LCC and LCM using all available Landsat time series (TS) data from 2000 to 2020. Then, the harmonic regression coefficients and RMSE values derived from CCDC (hereafter called CCDC features) were fed into the DCNN model for LCC classification. Our findings indicate: (1) For LCC and LCM accuracy assessment, the CCDC and BEAST ensemble achieved a spatial F1 score of 82.7% and an average temporal F1 score of 79.7%. (2) In LCC classification, the DCNN model with CCDC features, particularly DeepLabV3+, outperformed the pixel-based XGBoost and other multi-year land cover products, with frequency-weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), overall accuracy, and Kappa scores of 88.7%, 94%, and 0.87, respectively. (3) Seasonal LCM showed a more concentrated distribution than trend LCM. (4) In Jinchang City, LCM larger than LCC in area, and grassland and cultivated land are the most distributed. Our approach can be contributed to wall-to-wall land surface monitoring and enhance land management capabilities."

 Low scattering terrain areas introduce complex phase interference, which reduces the accuracy of deformation signal estimation in InSAR(Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) techniques. Existing covariance matrix-based InSAR phase calculation methods often fail to account for translational offset relations between scatterers leading to inaccuracies, and pixels with zero spatial coherence exist. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed scatterer InSAR phase estimation method based on the Cross-Correlation complex coherence matrix. The effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm are verified through simulation and actual data. The results show that: (i) The simulation analysis shows that, compared to the traditional covariance matrix method, the optimal Cross-Correlation matrix improves the interferometric phase, coherence, and accuracy by 21.51%, 15.24%, and 6.52%, respectively. (ii) The actual experimental data show that the interferometric phase optimal by the Cross-Correlation matrix can effectively overcome the pseudo-signal caused by spatial hopping and make the phase more continuous. Compared with the traditional covariance matrix, the average a posteriori coherence and average coherence of arbitrary interference combinations in the Cross-Correlation matrix are improved by 18.12% and 58.10%, respectively. (iii) The number of DS points selected by the Cross-Correlation matrix algorithm is more than that of the covariance matrix algorithm. PS-InSAR (Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) achieved more accurate deformation rates compared to the covariance and correlation matrices, with errors of 9.34, 17.21, and 16.28 mm∙a-1 when compared against GNSS data, respectively. (iv) The Cross-Correlation matrix reduces the deformation rate error by 5.43 % relative to the covariance matrix. The algorithm provides reliable phase estimation for accurate monitoring of surface deformation in low-scattering regions, supporting geological disaster early warning and resource and environmental management."

 Effective management of corn straw and stubble is critical in conservation tillage, as it impacts soil health and productivity. However, accurate classification of different types of straw cover has been hindered by their similar spectral and spatial characteristics and the low spatial resolution of hyperspectral satellite imagery. Moreover, traditional convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods, which rely on first-order statistics for feature extraction, often struggle to extract distinguishable features of highly similar objects effectively, thereby reducing classification accuracy. In this study, a second-order statistical-feature extraction algorithm based on CNN that uses fused multispectral and hyperspectral data was tested for its ability to classify types of straw cover. In the first step, coupled non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) was used to fuse hyperspectral and multispectral images effectively, thereby enhancing the spatial resolution of the hyperspectral data. In this study, we integrated pointwise convolution (PWC), depthwise convolution (DWC), and a distance covariance matrix (DCM) to form a mixed convolution and DCM (MCDCM) network; we used this to extract and integrate deep spectral–spatial features of the hyperspectral images. Our experimental results show that the MCDCM network significantly improved classification accuracy compared to traditional methods, with accuracy rates for the different straw-cover types exceeding 90% and overall accuracy reaching 98.26%. The fused image also exhibited better preservation of feature edges and contours. The accurate identification of corn-straw-cover types achieved with the proposed MCDCM method is a major step in optimizing conservation-farming practices, improving soil fertility and farm productivity, and supporting sustainable ecological development."

AAT has evolved into a fundamental process widely applied in large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based mapping. However classic AAT methods still face challenges like low efficiency and limited robustness. This paper introduces DeepAAT, a deep learning network designed specifically for AAT of UAV imagery. DeepAAT considers both spatial and spectral characteristics of imagery, enhancing its capability to resolve erroneous matching pairs and accurately predict image poses. DeepAAT marks a significant leap in AAT’s efficiency, ensuring thorough scene coverage and precision. Its processing speed outpaces incremental AAT methods by hundreds of times and global AAT methods by tens of times while maintaining a comparable level of reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, DeepAAT’s scene clustering and merging strategy facilitate rapid localization and pose determination for large-scale UAV images, even under constrained computing resources.

 Effective geographic environment observation planning is the key to obtain disaster monitoring and warning information. The previous researches can only make observation plans for a single disaster at some specific stages. They are difficult to apply to the dynamic evolution of the disaster chain. Timely and comprehensive geographic environment observation planning is urgently needed to provide high-value monitoring data for the identification and response of secondary disaster chains. Event logic graph (ELG) shows great potential in evolutionary law expression and chain event reasoning. Therefore, this study proposed an observation ELG (OELG), in which events and their logical relationships are modeled as nodes and edges to express the occurrence and development motivation of observation events. The disaster chain observation planning can be transformed into the reasoning of potential continuous observation events. Subsequently, an OELG-based geographic environment observation planning framework was proposed, which realizes the construction, instantiation, and plan reasoning of OELG. The observation planning experiment was carried out taking the flood disaster chain that occurred in Beijing, China and Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany as examples. The results show that OELG can generate disaster chain observation plan more timely, comprehensively, and continuously than other models, thus providing support for disaster chain risk monitoring and emergency response."

 Knowledge about the impact craters on rocky planets is crucial for understanding the evolutionary history of the universe. Compared to traditional visual interpretation, deep learning approaches have improved the efficiency of crater detection. However, single-source data and divergent data quality limit the accuracy of crater detection. In this study, we focus on valuable features in multi-modal remote sensing data from Chang’e lunar exploration mission and propose an Attention-based Dual-branch Segmentation Network (ADSNet). First, we use ADSNet to extract the multi-modal features via a dual-branch encoder. Second, we introduce a novel attention for data fusion where the features from the auxiliary modality are weighted by a scoring function and then being fused with those from the primary modality. After fusion, the features are transferred to the decoder through skip connection. Lastly, high-accuracy crater detection is achieved based on the learned multi-modal data features through semantic segmentation. Our results demonstrate that ADSNet outperforms other baseline models in many metrics such as IoU and F1 score.

 Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention across various research domains due to their impressive performance, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), known for their exceptional accuracy in image processing tasks. However, the opaque nature of DNNs has raised concerns about their trustworthiness, as users often cannot understand how the model arrives at its predictions or decisions. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in critical fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where the stakes are high. Consequently, there has been a surge in the development of explanation methods for DNNs. Typically, the effectiveness of these methods is assessed subjectively via human observation on the heatmaps or attribution maps generated by eXplanation AI (XAI) methods. In this paper, a novel GeoStatistics Explainable Artificial Intelligence (GSEAI) framework is proposed, which integrates spatial pattern analysis from Geostatistics with XAI algorithms to assess and compare XAI understandability. Global and local Moran’s I indices, commonly used to assess the spatial autocorrelation of geographic data, assist in comprehending the spatial distribution patterns of attribution maps produced by the XAI method, through measuring the levels of aggregation or dispersion. Interpreting and analyzing attribution maps by Moran’s I scattergram and LISA clustering maps provide an accurate global objective quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution of feature attribution and achieves a more understandable local interpretation. In this paper, we conduct experiments on aircraft detection in SAR images based on the widely used YOLOv5 network, and evaluate four mainstream XAI methods quantitatively and qualitatively. By using GSEAI to perform explanation analysis of the given DNN, we could gain more insights about the behavior of the network, to enhance the trustworthiness of DNN applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time XAI has been integrated with geostatistical algorithms in SAR domain knowledge, which expands the analytical approaches of XAI and also promotes the development of XAI within SAR image analytics."

 Tropical savannas have a patchy vegetation structure and heterogeneous composition that complicates their mapping and management. Land managers need detailed vegetation information, especially as tropical savannas often support extensive ranching systems or wildlife-based tourism and face specific challenges such as bush thickening, drought, bushfires and, in Africa, browsing by large game. Since existing methods to map savanna vegetation mosaics rarely provide the resolution or speed required, this study aimed to characterise savanna vegetation with sufficient detail for management purposes and sufficient generalisation for the assessment of processes at a landscape level, using an easy, quick, and cost-efficient system. The study area is a semi-arid savanna in a small game reserve south of Etosha National Park in Namibia. A rapid field assessment focused on the woody vegetation and used the Bitterlich method. Indicator species analysis and MRPP tests resulted in five mixed woody vegetation classes. Random Forest was used to model vegetation composition, structure and woody cover. The highest accuracy was obtained for vegetation composition (77 %) and the lowest for vegetation cover (71 %) with similar accuracies at a resolution of 10 m compared to 30 m. The most important predictors were a radar mosaic (ALOS PALSAR HV) and Sentinel-2 data representing days in wet and dry seasons, with MSAVI2 a more suitable vegetation index than NDVI. Other predictors such as land surface temperature during winter nights, geology, and distance to water points contributed to the models. The final vegetation map contains 10 classes based on woody vegetation composition and structure. The most dominant classes were Colophospermum mopane – Terminalia prunioides woodland (33 %) and bushland (18 %) with grassland only covering 2.5 %. The method described here was driven by management requirements and can be used for bush control monitoring, quantifying the carbon pool and carrying capacity.

 Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements, necessitating accurate and timely detection of burned areas for post-fire management. This study focused on the immediate assessment of a recent major forest fire that occurred on March 15, 2024, in southwestern China. We comprehensively utilized high temporal resolution MODIS and Black Marble nighttime light images to monitor the fire’s development and introduced a novel method for detecting burned forest areas using a new Shadow-Enhanced Vegetation Index (SEVI) coupling with a machine learning technique. The SEVI effectively enhances the vegetation index (VI) values on shaded slopes and hence reduces the VI disparity between shaded and sunlit areas, which is critical for accurately extracting fire scars in such terrain. While SEVI primarily identifies burned forest areas, the Random Forest (RF) technique detects all burned areas, including both forested and non-forested regions. Consequently, the total burned area of the Yajiang forest fire was estimated at 23,588 ha, with the burned forest area covering 19,266 ha.

Current approaches, while successful, require laborious experimentation or large sample sizes. To elucidate shared determinants of antimalarial resistance that can empower in silico inference, we examined the genomes of 724Plasmodium falciparumclones, each selected in vitro for resistance to one of 118 compounds. We identified 1448 variants in 128 recurrently mutated genes, including drivers of antimalarial multidrug resistance. In contrast to naturally occurring variants, those selected in vitro are more likely to be missense or frameshift, involve bulky substitutions, and occur in conserved, ordered protein domains.

Translation can initiate on nascent mRNAs, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) can promote the recruitment of the pioneering 30S. Here, we examined 30Srecruitment to nascent mRNAs using cryo–electron microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence colocalization, and in-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry. We show that bS1 delivers the mRNA to the ribosome for SD duplex formation and 30Sactivation. Additionally, bS1 and RNAP stimulate translation initiation.

How substrates are released from SRP at the ER to subsequently access translocation factors is not well understood. We found that TMEM208 can engage the substrate binding domain of SRP to accelerate release of its bound cargo. Without TMEM208, slow cargo release resulted in excessive synthesis of downstream polypeptide before engaging translocation factors. Delayed access to translocation machinery caused progressive loss of insertion competence, particularly for multipass membrane proteins, resulting in their impaired biogenesis. Thus, TMEM208 facilitates prompt cargo handover from the targeting to translocation machinery to minimize biogenesis errors and maintain protein homeostasis."

This response, typical for most mammals, safeguards against short-term water deprivation but fails in the long term. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) use the short-term response during summer, whereas during winter, they lack thirst and survive without water for months. In this work, we show that long-term thirst suppression occurs despite hormonal and behavioral signs of a substantial fluid deficit and originates from hypoactivity of neurons in the circumventricular organs, which exhibit marked functional suppression during winter that blunts their sensitivity to thirst cues. Our work reveals a notable capacity of the evolutionarily conserved brain regions that control fluid homeostasis in mammals to enable long-term survival without water."

We report monthly resolved records of coral skeleton–bound nitrogen isotopes (CS-δ15N) to reconstruct denitrification in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ over the last 80 years. The data indicate strong decadal variation in ETNP denitrification, with maxima during the cool North Pacific phase of Pacific Decadal Variability. The maxima in denitrification (and thus oxygen deficiency) were likely due to stronger upwelling that enhanced productivity leading to greater oxygen demand in the thermocline. Prior findings of multidecadal-to-centennial ODZ trends were likely biased by this variability.
