This work provides a comprehensive review of 6PPD and 6PPD-q in the environment, focusing on four key aspects: source, occurrence, transformation, and toxicity. Key findings include the following: (1) Tire wear particles are the main source of 6PPD and 6PPD-q in the environment, with their release directly linked to traffic density. (2) Ozone levels, temperature, climate conditions (e.g., snowmelt and rainy seasons), and environmental settings (e.g., roadways, tunnels, and parking lots) can greatly affect exposure levels. (3) In addition to atmospheric ozonation, oxidation in the atmosphere, free radical oxidation, and photocatalytic oxidation also play key roles in transforming 6PPD to 6PPD-q within aquatic systems and soils. (4) URMS is caused by 6PPD-q attacking the organs of fish, leading to blood–brain barrier and vascular dysfunction, with observed interspecies differences in sensitivity; these differences may be linked to variations in metabolic capacity. (5) Both 6PPD and 6PPD-q can enter the human body through the food chain, but their metabolic mechanisms and pathological changes are still unclear. Given the significant research gaps, this review concludes with proposed future research directions to deepen understanding of 6PPD’s and 6PPD-q’s environmental impacts."

Here, we introduce the Pretrained Remote sensing pIxel-based Spatial-teMporal Deep Neural Network (PRISM-DNN), an advanced deep learning framework that couples unsupervised pretraining on vast unlabeled satellite data with supervised fine-tuning using ground-based measurements. PRISM-DNN extracts rich spatiotemporal features and produces stable, robust global fAOD and cAOD retrievals for 2001–2024. Compared with established satellite products (POLDER and MISR), PRISM-DNN achieves markedly higher correlation coefficients with AERONET, reaching 0.94 for fAOD (+26%) and 0.91 for cAOD (+58%) relative to their mean performance. The model also performs well on additional ground networks excluded from training with correlation coefficients of 0.84 and 0.80 for fAOD and cAOD, respectively. The 24-year data set reveals pronounced regional disparities, with eastern China showing substantial declines in both fAOD and cAOD consistent with long-term emission control efforts, whereas parts of India exhibit increasing fine-mode aerosol loading associated with intensified human activities. These findings highlight how integrating unsupervised pretraining enables robust long-term aerosol component retrievals, strengthening satellite-based environmental monitoring and paving the way for broader AI-driven advances in earth system science."

In this study, a ligand-mediated synergistic strategy for crystal facet and morphology regulation was employed to construct Co3O4 catalysts exposing distinct facets, including {001}, {011}, {111}, and {110}, and the catalytic activity of these catalysts was evaluated for the oxidation of toluene. Catalytic tests revealed that Co3O4–S achieved a T90 (temperature for 90% toluene conversion) of 259 °C, with the activity order being dodecahedron Co3O4–S {110} > flower-like Co3O4–H {011} > disciform Co3O4–Y {111} > cube-type Co3O4-L {001}. The superior catalytic activity of Co3O4–S is attributed to its exposed {110} crystal facets, which feature abundant oxygen vacancies, a higher concentration of Co3+ active sites, and a larger specific surface area. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the {110} crystal plane of Co3O4–S features the lowest oxygen vacancy formation energy (EVO {110} = 4.41 eV), the optimal O2 adsorption energy (Eads {110} = −1.88 eV), and toluene adsorption energy (Eads {110} = −2.38 eV), indicating strong ability for oxygen activation. This study clarifies the mechanism of the ligand-mediated facet-morphology synergistic regulation strategy, establishes a complete structure–activity chain of “facet/morphology → oxygen vacancy → adsorption energy → catalytic activity” for toluene oxidation, and provides key theoretical support and technical references for the rational design of high-efficiency non-noble metal catalysts for toluene oxidation."

In reservoir riparian zones, hydrological-fluctuation-induced redox oscillations restructure the SOM transformation dynamics. Iron (Fe) minerals and microbial consortia are recognized as primary SOM regulators under redox conditions, while their specific functions remain elusive. Herein, we investigated the influences of Fe speciation and microbial metabolism on the SOM transformation through redox incubations on riparian soils. The results demonstrated that the redox oscillations induced cyclic Fe(II)/Fe(III) transformation that liberated Fe-bound organic carbon and generated hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Enhanced organic substrate bioavailability upregulated microbial glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) pathways, resulting in a 2.5- to 5.3-fold increase in CO2 flux rate during oxic phases. However, Fe mineral crystallization and SOM transformation (e.g., lignin accumulation and labile organic substrate depletion) downregulated microbial energy metabolism (glycolysis, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation) compared to the static anoxic condition. The weakening of electron-donating capability decreased Fe reduction efficiency from 91.7% to 28.5%, thereby suppressing organic carbon release and •OH yields. Collectively, the effects of redox oscillations on the SOM transformation gradually diminished with cycle numbers. This study elucidated Fe mineral-microbe-SOM mechanistic linkages during redox oscillations, advancing theoretical frameworks for riparian ecosystem management."

Here we show the experimental investigation of the sulfuric acid weathering of olivine under simulated FT conditions (193–293 K). Our results reveal that FT cycling enhances both mechanical and chemical weathering processes, with the lifetime of olivine decreasing 23 times compared to those under continuous freezing conditions. Cryogenic weathering promotes olivine hydroxylation and generates secondary phases (e.g., hydrated sulfates and amorphous silica) that collectively retain substantial water in the solid phase. Quantitative comparisons show these cryogenic weathering products retain approximately sevenfold higher water content per unit ion release compared to equivalent materials formed at ambient temperatures. These findings highlight FT cycling as an efficient geological mechanism for simultaneous mineral alteration and water sequestration, advancing mechanistic understanding of Martian hydrological evolution and habitability potential."

We show that the innovative Ka‐band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) onboard the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite makes it possible to visualize seiche‐like structures within lagoons of French Polynesia. This ability to capture two‐dimensional sea surface undulations of low amplitude (on the order of a few centimeters) in relatively small water bodies (less than 80 km in length) is unprecedented in satellite altimetry, and opens new avenues of research into these events and their contribution to coastal erosion and flooding. Our study combines sea surface height observations from SWOT with in situ measurements conducted in the Raroia lagoon and theoretical calculations based on an eigenvalue model. These three complementary approaches—satellite remote sensing, in situ data, and theoretical modeling—allow us to investigate both the spatial and spectral properties of seiches in atoll islands."

Amann,How Fault Zone Fabric Controls the Hydro‐Mechanical Behavior and Evolution of Critical State Shearing in Clay Shale,"Understanding the hydro‐mechanical behavior of faults in clay‐rich formations is essential for earthquake mechanics and underground storage applications. We conducted fully hydro‐mechanically coupled triaxial tests on preserved fault material from scaly clay sections of the Opalinus Clay formation. The faulted rock exhibits no post‐peak weakening and maintains distributed strain accommodation through the reactivation of multiple, sub‐parallel tectonic micro‐shears. The hydro‐mechanical response is stress‐dependent, transitioning from dilative shearing at lower effective consolidation stresses to constant volumetric shearing at higher effective consolidation stresses, eventually resulting in critical state conditions. Shear strength analysis revealed the absence of cohesion in the scaly clay fabric, which reduces the rock's shear strength to below the residual strength of the intact rock. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for distributed, steady‐state shearing in naturally faulted clay shale and highlight the need to incorporate fabric‐dependent behavior into models of fault mechanics."

Silber,Radiosonde‐to‐Space (R2S) Atmospheric Specifications: Bridging Observations and Models for Infrasound Propagation,"Infrasound propagation is inherently asymmetric and time‐dependent, making accurate atmospheric specifications essential for predicting when and where signals arrive. The Naval Research Laboratory's Ground‐to‐Space (G2S) model is widely used for this purpose, yet discrepancies between G2S predictions and observations highlight the need for improvement. Here we develop Radiosonde‐to‐Space (R2S) specifications by merging direct radiosonde‐based observations of the lower atmosphere with G2S profiles aloft, producing continuous profiles from the ground surface elevation to 150 km. We compare more than 6,000 G2S–R2S pairs for Albuquerque, New Mexico, and conduct propagation modeling on representative endmembers spanning the range of differences. While G2S typically reproduces most R2S‐predicted arrivals, important exceptions occur that would affect event interpretation in real world scenarios. These results demonstrate that although G2S provides robust global coverage, predictions can change when direct lower‐atmosphere observations are incorporated, motivating broader integration of real‐time radiosonde data into global atmospheric specifications."

In the warmer climate, the classic PNA‐like teleconnection strengthens and shifts eastward, with large ensemble member consistency. An additional Rossby wave source emerges over the southeastern U.S. (SEUS), generated largely by an eastward‐extended MJO in concert with the subtropical jet, providing a more direct pathway for tropical variability to influence SEUS weather. These changes nearly double SEUS precipitation anomalies and substantially increase extremes, with 82% of members projecting growth in persistent extreme events. Results highlight greater subseasonal extreme risks in a warmer climate and emphasize the importance of both MJO variability and the background state in shaping future teleconnections."

Neyestani;Jiachen Zhang,Quantifying Urban Morphology‐Induced Uncertainty in Urban Meteorology and Heat Stress Simulations in Southern California,"Accurate representation of land use and urban morphological parameters (UMPs), particularly building height, road width, and roof width, is critical for urban climate/weather modeling. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) coupled with the Single‐Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM) has been widely used; however, few studies have quantified urban modeling uncertainties associated with UMPs in Los Angeles, a key metropolitan area. This study assesses the impact of UMPs on WRF–SLUCM simulations in Los Angeles and quantifies UMP‐induced uncertainties in 2‐m air temperature (T2), relative humidity (RH), wind speed and other outputs by integrating Polynomial Chaos Expansion, Sobol sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo methods. We apply urban Local Climate Zone (LCZ) land use data and find that incorporating accurate UMPs based on Los Angeles County improves wind speed simulations compared with default LCZ UMPs. Uncertainty analyses reveal strong sensitivities of urban meteorology to 50% UMP perturbation. The resulting average standard deviations of 2‐m air temperature are 0.02 K (day) and 0.23 K (night), while those of urban canyon temperature are 0.51 K (day) and 1.03 K (night). Wind speed uncertainties are also notable, reaching 0.42 m/s (day) and 0.27 m/s (night). Among UMPs, building height has the strongest influence on urban T2, RH, and wind speed. Furthermore, uncertainties in urban meteorology propagate into heat stress estimates, where different indices show different spatial patterns of uncertainty. These findings underscore the importance of accurately representing UMPs in urban climate/weather simulations and their implications for assessing urban heat stress."

This study investigates how In‐Fa remotely influenced the 21·7PRE by decomposing atmospheric fields using the multiscale window transform into basic‐scale (>64 days), intraseasonal‐scale (16–64 days), and synoptic‐scale (<16 days) motions. A prominent mid‐to‐lower‐tropospheric anticyclone, located approximately 880 km west of In‐Fa, acted as intermediary circulation linking the typhoon and the rainfall event. The anticyclone channeled moisture into Henan, producing pronounced meridional moisture convergence and supplying ∼64% of the total moisture during the event. Meanwhile, intraseasonal‐scale easterlies between In‐Fa and the western Pacific subtropical high facilitated westward wave‐energy propagation, which intensified an upper‐level divergence zone over Henan Province. This upper‐level divergence, together with local mesoscale cyclone activity, played a critical role in sustaining the extreme rainfall. These results indicate that Typhoon In‐Fa exterted a substantial remote influence on the 21·7PRE through a synoptic‐scale, cold‐core anticyclonic anomaly that mediated wave‐energy propagation and organized moisture transport. The findings highlight a dynamical pathway by which tropical cyclones can affect distant predecessor rain events beyond classical moisture‐conveyor and subtropical‐high paradigms."

However, due to limited measurements, the behavior of these quantities, particularly in TCs over the western North Pacific (WNP), is not fully understood. Here we analyze observations from dropsondes and radiosondes in 141 WNP TCs in 2009–2024. We find that over the deep and open South China Sea (SCS), the drag coefficient increases with wind speed until reaching 1.5 × 10−3 at a threshold wind speed of 30 m s−1, then levels off or decreases above this wind speed. A quadrant analysis further reveals that the drag coefficient is significantly higher in the left‐front storm quadrant than in the right‐front and rear quadrants at wind speed around 30 m s−1. Over the urban area, the drag coefficient is about 102 times higher than the open ocean and does not show significant variation with wind speed up to 25 m/s.

However, the connection between these droughts and the atmospheric water cycle remains unclear. Here, we applied two process‐based models—the Dynamic Recycling Model (DRM) and the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model—to investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of atmospheric water cycles during SCB summer droughts from 1979 to 2022. The results show that the climatological mean precipitation recycling ratios for June, July, and August were 12.92%, 13.04%, and 12.63%, respectively, indicating the SCB's strong dependence on externally transported moisture. Most droughts are linked to deficits in external moisture transport. However, in the later stages of the most severe droughts (e.g., August 2006 and 2022), the drought evolves from preceding external moisture reduction into an internal‐moisture‐depletion regime. This shift is driven by extreme soil moisture depletion, which markedly intensifies land–atmosphere coupling and ultimately leads to the collapse of local moisture recycling. Moisture tracking further reveals that droughts with external deficits are associated with reduced oceanic inflow, while those with internal deficits exhibit reduced terrestrial moisture contributions despite sufficient oceanic supply, reflecting low efficiency in converting available moisture into rainfall. Large‐scale circulation systems, especially the Western Pacific Subtropical High and mid‐latitude westerlies, play a key role in shaping these drought‐related anomalies by regulating moisture transport and precipitation efficiency, while land–atmosphere coupling further amplifies these anomalies. These findings provide new insights into summer drought dynamics in the SCB and inform improved drought prediction under a changing climate."

Over 45% of dust events were recorded at two sites in the Chihuahuan Desert. The intensity of dust events, indicated by regional average concentration of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter ≤ 10 μm) during these events, decreased by −0.24 μg/m3 per year compared to −0.10/m3 per year on non‐dust days. However, the number and frequency of both severe dust events (24‐hr PM10 > 40 μg/m3) and moderate dust events (30 μg/m3 < PM10 ≤ 40 μg/m3) have increased with moderate events increasing faster than severe events. The variability of dust event frequency was strongly associated with that of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The increasing wind speed has a stronger effect on the dust activity in the Northwest, whereas in the Southwest, the decreasing soil moisture has a larger impact on the increase in dust event frequency. This work provides the latest dust climatology, along with the underlying climate drivers and synoptic indicators that control the long‐term variations of dust events over the western US."

We apply the customized inversion to 3 years (July 2018–December 2019 and January 2021–June 2022) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to derive annual NOx emissions for 24 isolated hotspots (21 urban, three power plants) compared to at most 5 for Sub‐Saharan Africa in past global studies. Annual hotspot emissions total 311.5 kt NO. Urban hotspot emissions range from <2 mol s−1 for Antananarivo, Madagascar, to 27.7 ± 12.6 mol s−1 for the megacity Lagos in Nigeria. Coal‐fired power plant emissions are 2.7 ± 1.0 mol s−1 for Hwange, Zimbabwe, and similar (∼70 mol s−1) for Lethabo and combined Matimba and Medupi plumes in South Africa.

Our understanding of the interactions underlying these feedbacks at different spatial and temporal scales and the extent to which feedbacks affect Earth system functioning remains limited. Climate change and other anthropogenic pressures are already negatively affecting ecological processes in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. These will most likely be amplified in the coming decades under our current warming and socioeconomic pathways. The knock‐on impacts on ecological feedbacks have the potential to cause rapid perturbations to the Earth system, and may significantly impact the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Yet, the role of our planet's diverse ecological feedbacks in Earth system processes and the impacts of perturbations are major knowledge gaps. Here we review and synthesize current understanding of ecological feedbacks and how they affect physical and chemical processes. We then consider the implications of ecological feedbacks for analyses of anthropogenically‐driven change, development of scientific understanding and models, and provision of scientific advice for policymakers.

However, past studies have not effectively separated the influences of anthropogenic management practices (AMP) from climate factors, leaving the actual temporal effects of climate change on crop phenology unclear. This study developed a novel framework that isolates AMP interference and quantifies real temporal effects to address this critical challenge. Focusing on China's major corn zones during 1990–2020, we applied the Hodrick‐Prescott (HP) filter to separate AMP influences and employed gray correlation analysis to quantify both cumulative and lagged temporal effects on two key phenological stages (the three‐leaf stage and maturity) of corn. Our results demonstrate that the HP filter effectively isolates AMP effects, revealing that raw data underestimate climate impacts by 25 ± 10%. AMP modulates temporal responses by extending cumulative time by 3–29 days while reducing lagged time by 2–11 days. Lagged effects dominating by 0.06 ± 0.02 compared to cumulative effects nationwide. Spatial analysis further uncovers significant heterogeneity: in the arid northwest, lagged time to temperature and solar radiation exceed cumulative time by 12–18 days, whereas in the northern plains, cumulative time prevails. Notably, the “Qinling‐Huaihe Line” emerges as a key demarcation, with northern zones exhibiting longer cumulative and shorter lagged time relative to the south. These findings advance our understanding of climate‐induced phenological shifts and offer actionable insights for precision agriculture and global food security."

 Adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) involves complex and heterogeneous alterations in brain functional organization. A possible explanation is the disruption of individualized brain maturation during adolescence, which typically transitions from lower-order sensory to higher-order association regions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed resting-state functional MRI data using advanced matrix decomposition techniques to extract organizational gradients, temporal dynamics, and information flow. Clustering sensory–association gradient features in our main sample (NMDD = 302 and NControls = 207; ages 11-17) revealed two subtypes. Subtype 1 showed bottom‑up (sensory‑to‑association) flow, reduced synergy but heightened redundancy in sensory cortices, and a highly modular yet globally inefficient network—patterns consistent with aberrant sensory processing and impaired integration. Subtype 2 instead displayed a top‑down (association‑to‑sensory) flow, reduced synergy in association areas, elevated redundancy in sensory regions, and network efficiency between subtype 1 and healthy controls, suggesting compensatory higher‑order engagement. Subtypes also differed in age-related changes, clinical profiles, and neurobiological processing. These patterns were largely replicated in an independent sample (NMDD = 73 and NControls = 28). Overall, the sensory-association axis distinguishes MDD subtypes, integrating functional heterogeneity, cortical dynamics, developmental trajectories, and genetic influences, offering new insights for pathophysiology and precision psychiatry.

 Developing a practical and robust cloud removal method has long been a crucial research objective in the field of remote sensing. Existing multi-temporal approaches typically adopt cloud-free images from other acquisition dates as training targets. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneity of optical observations introduces intrinsic limitations to this paradigm. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel cloud removal strategy based on a Generate-to-Remove (G2R) self-supervised framework. Unlike conventional methods, G2R employs the cloudy image itself as the supervision target, thereby introducing temporal constraints into the reconstruction process and enabling faithful recovery of the original surface features beneath cloud-covered regions. Furthermore, to address the insufficient capability of existing multi-temporal networks in modeling spatio-spectral dynamics and cross-dimensional interactions, we design the Spectral–Spatial Mamba network (SSMamba). Built upon a structured state space model, SSMamba adopts dual spectral and spatial branches tailored for multi-temporal inputs, achieving coordinated representation learning and efficient feature interaction. This design allows for fully exploiting spectral consistency and spatial dependencies across temporal observations, leading to improved detail restoration and stronger generalization. Experimental results on multiple real-image scenes demonstrate that the proposed framework not only achieves accurate reconstruction of cloud-covered regions but also delivers substantial advantages over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its strong potential for operational applications."

 Large-scale rice mapping is crucial for agricultural management and climate change studies but is hampered by challenges such as the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of high-quality data, sample scarcity, and limited model transferability. To overcome these barriers, this study presents a pioneering framework that shifts the paradigm from traditional reconstruction of spectral data to the reconstruction of time-continuous classification model sequences guided by phenological knowledge constraints. Unlike traditional methods that focus on reconstructing raw spectral data, our approach models the continuous evolution of parameters of classification models throughout the growing season. By training discrete Logistic Regression (LR) models regularized by their temporal predecessors, we ensure biophysical realism and link model dynamics directly to rice canopy development. This sparse sequence is then interpolated into a continuous trajectory also under the constraints of rice canopy development. The model-space interpolation enables optimal handling of observations from any arbitrary date and facilitates robust, sample-free model transfer. Long-term validation (1984–2024) and cross-regional rice mapping applications across China, Japan, Italy, and the USA demonstrate that our method achieves high classification accuracy (OA > 0.95) and robust generalization (relative errors < 10%). This study demonstrates that reconstructing model parameter sequences—rather than the raw data itself—is a feasible and powerful strategy for large-scale rice mapping across diverse climatic zones. Beyond rice mapping, the proposed strategy of reconstructing model parameter sequences may offer a transformative perspective for the broader Earth observation community. It demonstrates that when direct high-quality observations are intermittent, modeling the continuous evolution of the classification logic itself under phenological or geographic knowledge is a powerful alternative to data imputation. This conceptual shift provides a scalable solution for monitoring various highly dynamic Earth surface processes, such as forest phenology, and land degradation, where temporal consistency and physical interpretability are paramount."

 The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) Plain in north China has experienced significant land subsidence due to long-term groundwater overexploitation. Although water diversion project and climate change have improved groundwater conditions overall, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in land deformation responses to groundwater recovery remains unclear. This study reconstructs and identifies differentiated deformation patterns across the BTH Plain under the new hydrological background, revealing their multi-scale response mechanisms to groundwater change. After mosaicking Time-Series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (TS-InSAR) deformation fields, we reconstructed the seasonal and long-term components of deformation. A long-term deformation characteristic-constrained K-means clustering method was developed to classify distinct deformation evolution patterns. Coupling these patterns with groundwater-level (GWL) observations to further distinguish the annual lag and long-term delayed response of deformation to GWL changes. From 2016 to 2024, the BTH Plain exhibits clear spatial partitioning of deformation behaviors, categorized as 10.14% continuous subsidence, 18.86% reduced subsidence, 46.09% stable deformation, and 24.91% slight rebound. Uncertainties in the reconstructed deformation reflect short-term fluctuations driven by extreme hydrological or anthropogenic disturbances. Short-time Fourier transform analysis reveals periodic response of deformation to GWL change and annual lag: elastic deformation dominated areas lag GWL by ≤ 2 months, whereas clay-rich persistent subsiding areas lag 4–6 months. The exponential decay model further indicates that the recovery of subsidence funnels is governed by geological structures: funnels intersecting faults show the slowest subsidence decay along their edges, while those without faults display a more uniform edge-to-center recovery pattern."

 Accurate and efficient monitoring of seedling emergence is critical for early-stage crop management and yield forecasting in sugarcane production. To meet this practical demand for precise field phenotyping, this study developed a high-throughput phenotyping framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data and machine learning. This framework addresses the critical agricultural challenges of inefficient manual counting and the need for plot-scale monitoring in sugarcane production by enabling high-throughput sugarcane seedling number prediction through the integration of UAV-acquired RGB and multispectral imagery. Specifically, the sugarcane canopy was accurately segmented from the background using K-means clustering, a step that enabled the extraction of canopy area and the generation of a mask for obtaining canopy-level average features (including vegetation indices and texture features). These features together form a comprehensive feature set. Subsequently, six different feature selection methods were used to optimize the feature set, and eight machine learning models were combined for training and evaluation. The results showed that the combination of Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) and KBest-F feature selection method yielded the optimal prediction performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7641, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.42, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 15.93. Further analysis identified canopy area, the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), red edge contrast, and green entropy as core predictive features. They collectively contribute over 60% of total feature importance, and their synergistic effects support accurate seedling number estimation. This framework offers an efficient, scalable tool for plot-scale seedling monitoring, with substantial potential for precision field management of high-density crops."

 Effectively combating soil erosion under intensifying extreme precipitation requires moving beyond broad-scale assessments to precision-targeted interventions. Current approaches often fail to capture the differentiated erosion responses across diverse landscapes, limiting the efficacy of conservation investments. Here, we introduce a novel framework that combines modeling (RUSLE) with Explainable artificial intelligence (LightGBM model with SHAP method) and multi-criteria decision analysis to prioritize soil and water conservation (SWC) efforts. Applied to 20 SWC zones in the ecologically critical Yunnan Province, China, our analysis reveals that maximum 5-day precipitation (RX5) is the paramount driver of erosion, superseding other precipitation metrics. We uncover distinct regional response mechanisms: erosion in northwestern cold alpine zones is governed by cumulative rainfall, while erosion in temperate and tropical zones is triggered by short-duration, high-intensity events. This mechanistic understanding enabled the robust identification of the Northwest Alpine Gorge and Western Broad Valley zones as highest-priority areas demanding urgent action. By systematically diagnosing the primary climatic drivers and identifying the most vulnerable regions, our framework provides a powerful, replicable blueprint for optimizing conservation resources and enhancing climate resilience in mountainous ecosystems globally."

 Artificial light at night (ALAN) influences safety perceptions, public health, energy use, and biodiversity, yet its eye-level impacts remain difficult to quantify at city scale. Meanwhile, reducing outdoor lighting is especially contested because the widely held belief that “brighter is safer” sustains excessive ALAN even in low-crime cities such as Hong Kong. We assert that unveiling the threshold effect of brightness on perceived safety and human behavior is crucial for shifting the linear paradigm and informing acceptable lighting adjustments. However, auditing urban-scale nighttime perceived safety is challenging because nighttime street view imagery (SVI) is almost nonexistent. Most studies rely on limited nighttime samples, satellite radiance, or daytime SVI as proxies, ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of nightscapes and differences between day and night. Moreover, lighting intensity is often examined in silo; how it interacts with urban forms is underexplored. To address these gaps, we developed a multimodal diffusion model trained on 2600 paired day–night SVIs and conditioned on SDGSAT-1 radiance (40 m) and POI context to synthesize context-aware nighttime scenes from 58,500 daytime SVIs (50 m spacing) across Hong Kong. A validated vision-language model was used to score perceived nighttime safety from generated images, while semantic area, brightness, and depth (ABD) features were extracted to model their interactions. To characterize human behaviors, approximately 150,000 volunteered trajectories of physical activities were collected. The ABD interactions extracted from eye-level nightscapes alone explained 49.3% (36.5%) of the variation in day–night activity disparities (perceived nighttime safety), significantly outperforming satellite-based radiance. Near-field, line-of-sight lighting on facades, trees, and sidewalks is consistently associated with higher safety and stronger nighttime activity retention. Brightness shows diminishing gains beyond ∼ 40–60 luma DN (∼19–40 lx as an interpretive reference from our DN–lux field cross-walk) on nighttime perception and physical activity across heterogeneous urban contexts, indicating significant potential for reduced light pollution in overlit areas. This study demonstrates the necessity and provides a scalable toolkit for auditing nighttime environments at eye level to support sustainable and healthy cities."

 China's effective control of PM2.5 has coincided with increasing ozone concentrations and frequent compound pollution of PM2.5 and O3 (co-pollution), indicating the critical role of aerosols in air pollution. To investigate the impact of aerosol extinction on ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA), the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, incorporating an enhanced Mie scattering parameterization, was applied to simulate a co-pollution episode (25–30 September 2022) in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. The improved single-scattering albedo (mean bias decreased by 87%) provided a robust foundation for aerosol extinction assessment. During the episode, aerosol extinction suppressed surface photolysis rates, reducing regional surface O3 concentrations by 2.59 ± 4.6% and increasing SOA concentrations by 3.40 ± 9.90%. Although SOA increased across the region, it decreased in heavily polluted Beijing under the influence of aerosol extinction, exhibiting variations consistent with those of O3. Process analysis in Beijing indicated that within the planetary boundary layer (PBL), aerosol extinction lowered O3 by suppressing daytime chemical production and inhibiting SOA formation mainly by suppressing aerosol-phase conversion, with the strongest effect occurring near the surface and gradually diminishing with altitude. However, at the top of the PBL, aerosol extinction resulted in elevated O3 and SOA levels, strengthening vertical gradients and promoting downward transport, which offset ∼70% of the decrease in O3_CHEM and SOA_AERO below 440 m at midday. Furthermore, aerosol extinction led to greater decreases in pollutants in urban regions than in suburban areas, narrowing the urban–suburban concentration gap and thereby suppressing the outward transport of urban pollutants. The quantified role of aerosol extinction in O3 and SOA formation and transport provides critical insights into how declining aerosol concentrations may reshape future regional air quality."

 This study proposes a novel framework, GeoGMI, to generate virtual 89 GHz horizontally polarized brightness temperatures (TBs) of the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) on the geostationary Geo-Kompsat-2 A (GK-2 A) platform. The study aims to overcome the temporal sparsity of low-Earth orbit microwave (MW) observations during tropical cyclone (TC) events by leveraging the high-temporal resolution of GK-2 A. In contrast to conventional statistical techniques, GeoGMI employs a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that integrates optimized input feature selection with a composite loss function to learn storm-scale spatial structures effectively. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate the clear advantage of the proposed deep learning framework: the multiple linear regression (MLR) baseline shows limited predictive skill, with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.531 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15.599 K, whereas GeoGMI achieves a higher CC of 0.647 and a lower RMSE of 14.429 K. These improvements indicate that GeoGMI more faithfully reconstructs physically meaningful deep convective cores, capturing nonlinear relationships that linear models do not represent. Nonetheless, despite the enhanced performance, the reconstruction of fine-scale TC structural features remains less accurate than that from direct instrument observations, highlighting the need for further refinement to resolve sub-storm-scale variability. However, the generated 10-min interval virtual GMI-like TB fields effectively bridge the temporal gaps between GMI overpasses and enable continuous MW-like monitoring of TCs. GeoGMI offers a promising approach to improve near-real-time monitoring of a TC's internal structures using only geostationary satellite observations, thereby enhancing nowcasting capability and reducing disaster-related risks."

 The Tienshan Mountains of Central Asia, a key region in global arid and semi-arid zones, faces highly uneven precipitation distribution due to its unique topography and climate. While extreme heavy precipitation has been widely studied, research on extreme light precipitation is limited. Additionally, spatial distribution patterns and driving mechanisms of extreme events under varying climatic and geomorphic conditions remain underexplored. This study systematically examines the spatial-temporal trends of extreme hydro-climatic events, focusing on both extreme heavy and light precipitation, to provide insights for water resource management and disaster prevention. A distinct hydrological regime shift has occurred since 2000. The frequency anomaly of extreme light precipitation events (R1p) plunged from positive to negative, indicating a marked decline, whereas extreme heavy precipitation events (R99p) surged, reflecting a substantial increase in frequency. Spatially, a prominent dipole pattern is identified around 80°E, where extreme heavy precipitation frequency increases eastward and decreases westward. Vertically, the mid-altitude zone acts as an amplification center, exhibiting the sharpest intensification of heavy precipitation and the steepest decline in light precipitation frequency. These patterns result from the combined effects of Tibetan Plateau thermal dynamics and monsoon-driven moisture transport, creating distinct differences in extreme precipitation between the eastern and western Tienshan. Future studies should explore the interactions between the plateau and atmospheric circulation to improve the prediction and mitigation of extreme events, aiding water resource management and disaster preparedness."

 Recent studies have shown that the global temperatures are rising dramatically affecting the water and energy balances in the atmosphere, in turn, altering the precipitation regime and evaporative processes. These changes may cause aridification that can be estimated by the Aridity Index (AI), the ratio between the Precipitation (P) and Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0). High-resolution P and ET0 datasets are essential for accurate estimation of AI, as both variables exhibit strong spatial variability in topographically and climatically diverse regions. In this study, aridification in Europe is examined during the 1950–2024 period using the recently available ERA5-Land high-resolution climate reanalysis dataset, and it is integrated and bias-corrected with ground observations. The analysis covers three consecutive 25-year intervals to evaluate temporal shifts in aridity with particular emphasis on the quantitative contributions from P and ET0. Land classifications based on AI thresholds are also applied following the UNEP criteria, to examine both the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of humid, sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid zones. In addition to a domain-wide assessment, the analysis also investigates trends across distinct elevation bands and disaggregates findings at the national scale. This study provides one of the most comprehensive assessments of recent European aridification, demonstrating a clear acceleration and a fundamental shift toward evapotranspiration-driven aridification in the twenty-first century across large parts of the continent. Although aridification may be unavoidable in the near future, the fine resolution analysis presented herein provides a scientific basis for identifying vulnerable regions and development of targeted adaptation strategies."

 Stratospheric intrusions (SI) are natural and uncontrollable phenomena that pose challenges for improving air quality. This study introduces the STARFusion technique, a novel and versatile framework that integrates multi-source observations with modeling to identify both direct (DSI) and indirect (ISI) stratospheric intrusion events. The strength of STARFusion lies in its ability to establish direct links between stratospheric sources and receptor regions in the troposphere, including near-surface layers, by considering the dynamics of inclined transport. This study focuses on spring-summer SI events in Eastern China (EC) during 2019. Results highlight the distinct behaviors of ISI and DSI events. For tropospheric ozone, SI impacts are altitude-dependent. Compared to intrusion-free periods, ozone vertical profiles during SI events exhibit a pronounced curvature towards the tropopause with increasing ozone, with stronger effects from ISIs compared to DSIs. For near-surface ozone, ISI events lead to the highest frequency of exceedance, occurring 2.4 times more frequently than intrusion-free periods. These exceedances affect half of the monitoring sites, predominantly in the eastern coastal region of EC. Air quality standard violations are not observed during DSI events. Near-surface ozone exceedances exhibit a spatial drift towards the downwind regions influenced by SI. Additionally, we conduct detailed assessments of hourly, site-level SI contributions (14% to 26%), with exceedance cases halved after excluding SI-influenced site data. The STARFusion technique effectively disentangles stratospheric signals from anthropogenic pollution, which has scientific implications for deepening the understanding of SI occurrence, development, and its atmospheric mechanisms."
