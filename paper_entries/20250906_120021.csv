Defined as the difference between actual and attainable crop yields, they can be reduced by expanding irrigation and increasing nutrient inputs—strategies whose land, water, and nutrient requirements have been quantified in previous studies; however, their energy consumption and emissions remain largely unknown. This study quantifies the energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with yield gap closure through irrigation and fertilizer management. Our findings indicate that energy consumption for irrigation pumping, and fertilizer production under baseline scenario is 462 TWh and 1884 TWh per year, respectively. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers account for 97%, 2%, and 1% of total fertilizer energy consumption. These activities contribute 552 Mt CO2e annually—154 Mt from irrigation and 398 Mt from fertilizer production. Closing the full yield gap would double annual energy consumption to 4579 TWh with emissions of 1.1 Gt CO2e, equivalent to 3% of global energy consumption and 2% of total GHG emissions in 2020. Although closing 75% or 50% of the yield gap would reduce energy use and GHG emissions, countries such as India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and several in Sub-Saharan Africa would still face disproportionate burdens, requiring over 15% of their national energy consumption and more than 5% of their total GHG emissions to achieve the full yield gap closure. These findings reveal pronounced regional disparities in agricultural productivity, energy demands, and environmental trade-offs, underscoring the need for locally tailored strategies to strengthen food system resilience, while also advancing low-carbon energy infrastructure, reducing fossil fuel dependence, and enhancing energy security."

The designation of National Key Ecological Function Zones (NKEFZs) serves as a critical policy tool to strengthen ecological regulation. This study evaluates four key ecosystem services—water provision (WP), crop production (CP), carbon storage (CS), and habitat quality (HQ) —in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2022, analyzing supply-demand surpluses and deficits, spatial-temporal dynamics, and the policy impact of NKEFZs using a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) approach. The results show that the supply-demand balance exhibits notable spatial heterogeneity: (1) WP follows a ‘southern surplus–northern deficit’ pattern, CP and HQ show a ‘western surplus–eastern balance’ structure, and CS presents a ‘western surplus–eastern deficit’ configuration. (2) Temporally, from 2005 to 2022, the WP index rose from 0.12 to 0.30, CP increased from 0.63 to 0.90, CS declined from −0.03 to −0.38 despite a reduced deficit extent, and HQ remained stable though deficits expanded in eastern urban areas. (3) Comprehensive spatial-temporal analysis shows that surpluses are concentrated in western regions, while deficits dominate central and eastern cities, with most eastern and western areas improving, in contrast to declining trends in central cities; the province-wide average index rose from 0.45 to 0.51. (4) The DID results confirm that the NKEFZs policy significantly improved the balance of ecosystem services, with the effect remaining robust after multiple tests. This study offers a scientific basis for optimizing ecological protection policies and advancing sustainability through improved ecosystem service management."

Evapotranspiration (ET) is central to understand these processes, as it regulates water transport across the Amazon. However, its long-term responses to ongoing climate change and human activities remain poorly understood. This study conducted a multi-scale analysis of ET trends from basin to local scale in the most deforested region of the Brazilian Amazon. We applied a remote sensing-based model (geeSEBAL) from 1990 to 2022 to assess deforestation and climate change effects on ET. Our results indicate that overall ET in the Amazon arc of deforestation has increased by 11% during the dry season despite significant forest removal, largely due to the contribution of intact forests and global warming feedback. While these findings suggest a forest response to a changing climate, they also highlight a critical vulnerability that is exacerbated by the threat of ongoing deforestation. With projected warmer future climate and extended dry seasons, our results emphasize the complex interplay between water recycling and climate change in the world’s largest rainforest, with significant ecological and water security implications."

In the Amazon, deforestation disrupts this process, altering moisture source and sink dynamics of areas in the region and impacting its overall moisture recycling function. This study examined the spatial and temporal variability of moisture recycling by assessing the responses of moisture sources and sinks to deforestation across different time lags, focusing on the Amazon’s contribution to and dependency on its moisture recycling regime. We used the UTrack moisture tracking model and high-resolution deforestation data from MapBiomas to quantify changes in dependency and contribution of the Amazon over a 22 year period (2000–2021). Our findings revealed high heterogeneity in moisture recycling patterns across the Amazon. We also found that deforestation affects both immediate and delayed moisture recycling responses, with mid- and long-term responses (13–48 months and 49–72 months) more pronounced than immediate responses (1–12 months). Deforestation is associated with a decreasing evaporation contribution of the Amazon to its moisture recycling regime as moisture sources and an increasing dependency for precipitation as moisture sinks. These results underscore the persistent and delayed effects of deforestation on the hydrological cycle of this important biome."

Utilizing ship-based observations from a decaying cyclonic eddy off southeastern Sri Lanka, we reveal that while both the eddy interior and frontal zones exhibit elevated phytoplankton biomass due to different nutrient supply mechanisms, they drive divergent particulate organic carbon (POC) transfer efficiency: enhanced within the eddy but reduced at the front. Subsurface hydrodynamic processes and particle size distributions shaped contrasting export efficiency. During the decay phase, downwelling, weaker stratification, and larger particles inside the eddy promoted efficient POC transfer to depth. Conversely, frontal upwelling, strong stratification induced by water-mass convergence, and finer particles attenuated export. These findings demonstrate that decaying eddy-front systems exhibit spatially heterogeneous carbon sequestration efficiencies, challenging assumptions of uniform attenuation rates and underscoring the need to resolve life-stage dynamics in biological pump assessments."

With a myriad of heat indices in use and limited guidance on their purpose or performance, countries risk adopting ineffective systems misaligned with local risks and decision-making needs. This Perspective traces the roots of this fragmentation across disciplinary, operational, and institutional lines, showing how differing approaches from health, meteorology, and climate science have led to incompatible definitions and thresholds. We then propose a clear typology of heat indices, aligned with WMO guidance: (1) temperature indicators, (2) thermal indices, and (3) heatwave intensity indices. The typology clarifies what each type measures, where it performs best, and the trade-offs involved, helping systems move toward greater transparency, coherence, and fit-for-purpose. Each type offers distinct strengths, and many countries will benefit from layered approaches that combine them. Moving toward intensity-based approaches represents a conceptual shift, from identifying hot days to quantifying the severity of heatwaves. By aligning early warning systems with this understanding, countries can improve coordination, reduce health and societal impacts, and accelerate progress under global frameworks such as the UN’s Early Warnings for All initiative."

This study investigates the impacts of compound drought-flood (CDF) extremes using data from two widely-used disaster databases: the emergency events database (EM-DAT) and its geocoded disasters (GDIS), along with the DesInventar database. The analysis covers the period from 1960 to 2018, consistent with GDIS’ temporal coverage. CDF events are defined as instances where drought and flood hazards occur concurrently or sequentially, with a flood taking place during a drought period or within four months of its end. Our findings for the global extratropics reveal that the economic losses and the number of affected people resulting from CDF events are up to eight times higher than those ascribed to isolated droughts or floods, with a confidence interval ranging from one to twelve. Similar qualitative results emerge from DesInventar and EM-DAT, albeit with some quantitative differences. Furthermore, impact ratios have increased in more recent decades compared to earlier periods, emphasizing the increasing impacts of the drought-flood compound events. These results highlight the amplified negative impacts when droughts and floods occur concomitantly or sequentially, underscoring the need for targeted policies to address their socioeconomic risks, particularly under changing climatic conditions."

By comparing high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) Community Earth System Model simulations with tide gauge and altimeter data along the US. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) coast, we find that HR better represents both mean dynamic sea level (DSL) and daily mean extreme DSL (EDSL) statistics. In contrast, LR significantly underestimates the strength of EDSL mainly due to its deficiency in simulating strong TCs. Both observations and HR show larger daily mean EDSL on the western Gulf coast than on the eastern side, highlighting the need for HR climate simulations to improve coastal resilience planning."

Mangrove restoration strategies have typically focused on either passive (i.e. re-establishing tidal regimes suitable for natural mangrove recruitment), or active (planting) restoration approaches. To date, mangrove restoration projects typically consider chronic environmental pressures at a site (e.g. the tide). However, acute or extreme weather events (e.g. waves, floods, droughts, etc) are important drivers of global mangrove loss and are rarely considered in restoration projects. In this study, the mangrove lifecycle ecosystem analysis and forecasting model was used to monitor the temporal and spatial effectiveness of passive and active mangrove restoration projects when exposed to routine tides and wind waves, and extreme weather events like floods, droughts and storm conditions. Passive restoration was the most recommended strategy for mangrove survival and ecosystem services across all tested environmental conditions, except constant wind waves. These outcomes were overcome by the active planting of mangrove saplings with stems tall enough to resist overturning and/or wave breaking forces. Planting was most beneficial when restricted to bed elevations where propagules would naturally recruit and when waves were present. Propagule availability was found to be critical in re-populating sites post climatic events (e.g. storms) and was most effective in ensuring the long-term development of active restoration strategies. Mangrove planting provided immediate returns on ecosystem services post-restoration, before converging with the outputs of passive restoration. This study provides previously missing guidance regarding mangrove restoration for a range of chronic conditions and extreme weather events, highlighting the importance of aligning restoration conditions with the mangrove lifecycle for tailored restoration strategies."

This study reassesses county-level CLF in China (1990–2023) using a 30 m-resolution Landsat-based dataset and a novel Modified Landscape Division Index to capture both cropland gains (transfer-in) and losses (transfer-out). We find pronounced CLF increases in urbanized plains, notably the Huang–Huai–Hai Plain (6.13 × 10−2 y), Northeast China Plain (3.69 × 10−2 y), and Sichuan Basin (4.97 × 10−2 y), driven primarily by urbanization (39.5% contribution to CLF from impervious surfaces). Conversely, cropland gains from forests and grasslands mitigate fragmentation, with forest-to-cropland conversion reducing CLF by 40.3%. Counties with CLF increases due to losses outnumber those with decreases by 5.5 times. Regression analysis reveals strong correlations between area changes and CLF (p < 0.01). These insights are relevant for urbanizing regions globally, such as Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the need for policies like zoning regulations and reforestation incentives to balance urban expansion with cropland restoration for sustainable land use and food security."

These events were exceptional in intensity, persistence, and spatial extent, reflecting the combined influence of anthropogenic warming, short-term climate modes and complex atmosphere-ocean interactions. This study investigates the large-scale atmospheric drivers behind these extremes using NOAA OISST v2.1 and ERA5 reanalysis datasets. We characterize MHWs from May to August 2023, analyze surface and mid-tropospheric anomalies in pressure, air temperature, wind and air–sea heat flux and apply regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) to study multivariate links between atmospheric variability and MHW characteristics. Our findings show that the Subtropical Atlantic experienced the longest MHW, the Northwest Atlantic the most intense, and the Western Mediterranean the most frequent events. The summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Scandinavian Pattern (SCAN) emerged as key modulators of MHWs. Compound configurations of NAO−/SCAN+ in July-August and NAO+/SCAN− in May-June generated persistent atmospheric ridges and weakened the Azores High, which in turn suppressed winds, altered heat fluxes and mixed layer depths, and promoted stratification—leading to sustained surface warming. The leading RGCCA mode explains more than 40% of the SSTA variability and shows statistically robust correlations (r = 0.81–0.94) between atmospheric drivers and MHW evolution. This multivariate approach demonstrates how teleconnection patterns co-modulate regional MHW dynamics, underscoring the importance of compound atmospheric influences. Our results highlight the utility of RGCCA in diagnosing complex climate extremes and support the integration of large-scale atmospheric indicators into early warning systems and adaptation planning in the face of increased marine heat stress."

However, although a region has multiple advantages and disadvantages, the intersectionality of these factors has been overlooked. This study assessed spatial variation in heat-mortality associations in South Korea and investigated how regional characteristics intersect and interact to create distinct vulnerability patterns using a novel intersectionality framework. We analyzed the association between heat (defined as daily mean temperature at the 99th percentile) and non-accidental mortality across 229 regions of South Korea during 2011–2020. We conducted two-stage time-series analysis with a distributed lag nonlinear model to investigate heat-mortality associations and their spatial variations at the regional level. We then applied a multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy framework to examine the role of intersectional strata in explaining the spatial variation of heat-related risks. Heat-related mortality risks were spatially heterogeneous. The multiply disadvantaged regions (having a low annual mean temperature, a high proportion of older housing stock, and a low proportion of timely emergency room visits) exhibited the highest heat-related relative risk (RR) of 1.105 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.097, 1,112), while the multiply advantaged regions exhibited the lowest heat-related RR of 1.065 (95% CI: 1.057, 1.072). These intersectional inequalities are primarily driven by additive effects, with minimal contribution from interaction effects. Our findings suggest the need to develop region-specific heat adaptation strategies that address local vulnerability.

Our study examined how these particles form in a plant-rich region of Southeast Australia. We found frequent new particle formation (NPF) events, often linked to pollution plumes. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from plants and other factors influence NPF and aerosol growth. Nighttime NPF requires further study. Overall, plant emissions play a key role in aerosol formation in this region. 
 Aerosols play an important role in atmospheric processes influencing cloud formation, scattering and absorbing solar radiation and affecting trace gases through chemical reactions occurring in and on aerosol particles. Ultimately, aerosols affect the radiative balance of the Earth, modifying climate. A large fraction of aerosols is formed through chemical reactions following gas-to-particulate processes in the atmosphere: nucleation and growth. Biogenic secondary organic aerosols (BSOAs) are formed when plant-produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in the atmosphere through gas-phase oxidation. One of the highest biogenic VOC (BVOC)-emitting regions in the world is Southeast Australia due to the high density of Eucalyptus species. The Characterizing Organics and Aerosol Loading over Australia (COALA)-2020 (Characterizing Organics and Aerosol Loading over Australia) campaign worked towards gaining a better understanding of biogenic VOCs in quasi-pristine conditions in the atmosphere and their role in particle formation.The observations showed a highly reactive atmosphere with frequent new particle formation (NPF) occurring (42 % d with data), often associated with pollution plumes. Analysis of NPF events suggested that SO2 plumes likely triggered particle formation, while particle growth depended on available VOCs and hydroxyl radicals, and the presence of multiple SO2 intrusions promoted the growth of smaller clusters. Nighttime NPF events coincided with monoterpene ozonolysis but were rare. These findings highlight the significant role of biogenic VOCs in driving NPF and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in Southeast Australia. The COALA-2020 campaign provided valuable insights into local atmospheric chemistry and its potential impact on regional air quality and climate. However, longer-term observations are crucial to understand seasonal variations, trends, and extreme events."

In this paper, we assess regional trends of tropospheric ozone column amounts, based on two different approaches of merging or synthesizing ground-based observations and their trends within specific regions. Our findings clearly demonstrate regional trend differences but also consistently higher pre-COVID than post-COVID trends. 
 Quantifying long-term free-tropospheric ozone trends is essential for understanding the impact of human activities and climate change on atmospheric chemistry. However, this is complicated by two key challenges: the differences among existing satellite-derived tropospheric ozone products, which are not yet fully understood or reconciled, and the limited temporal and spatial coverage of ground-based reference measurements. Here, we explore if a more consistent understanding of the geographical distribution of tropospheric ozone column (TrOC) trends can be obtained by focusing on regional trends from ground-based measurements. Regions were determined with a correlation analysis between modeled TrOCs at the site locations. For those regions, TrOC trends were estimated with quantile regression for the Trajectory-mapped Ozonesonde dataset for the Stratosphere and Troposphere (TOST) and with a linear mixed-effects modeling (LMM) approach to calculate synthesized trends from homogenized HEGIFTOM (Harmonization and Evaluation of Ground-based Instruments for Free-Tropospheric Ozone Measurements) individual site trends. For different periods (1990–2021/22, 1995–2021/22, 2000–2021/22), both approaches give increasing (partial) tropospheric ozone column amounts over almost all Asian regions (median confidence) and negative trends over Arctic regions (very high confidence). Trends over Europe and North America are mostly weakly positive (LMM) or negative (TOST). For both approaches, the 2000–2021/22 trends decreased in magnitude compared to 1995–2021/22 for most regions; and for all time periods and regions, the pre-COVID trends are larger than the post-COVID trends. Our results enable the validation of global satellite TrOC trends and assessment of the performance of atmospheric chemistry models to represent the distribution and variation of TrOC."

However, only sea level anomalies are retrieved; to monitor the entire ocean signal, mean dynamic topography (MDT) must be added to these anomalies. In this study, an evaluation of new NES-CLS22 MDT shows significant improvements in the Arctic. Over the globe, this new solution is better than its predecessor, although the two solutions remain close. 
 The mean dynamic topography (MDT) is a key reference surface for altimetry. It is needed for the calculation of the ocean absolute dynamic topography, and under the geostrophic approximation, the estimation of surface currents. CNES-CLS MDT solutions are calculated by merging information from altimeter data, GRACE, and GOCE gravity field and oceanographic in situ measurements (drifting buoy velocities, High Frequency radar surface velocities, hydrological profiles). The objective of this paper is to present the newly updated CNES-CLS22 MDT. The main improvement of this new CNES-CLS22 MDT over the previous CNES-CLS18 MDT is in the Arctic, with better coverage and a more physical solution (with the disappearance of artifacts from the previous version). This is due to the use of a new first guess estimated with the CNES-CLS22 MSS and the GOCO06s geoid to which optimal filtering has been applied, as well as Lagrangian filtering at the coast to reduce the intensity of currents normal to the coast. Improvements also include updating the drifting buoy and T/S profile databases, and processing to obtain synthetic mean geostrophic velocities and synthetic mean heights. In addition, a new data type, HF radar data, was processed to extract physical content consistent with MDT in the Mid Atlantic Bight of the northeast U.S. coastal region. The study of this region in particular has shown the improvements of the CNES-CLS22 MDT, though there is still work to be done to obtain a more physical solution over the continental shelf. The CNES-CLS22 MDT has been evaluated against independent height and velocity data in comparison with the previous version, the CNES-CLS18. The new solution presents slightly better results, although not identical in all regions of the globe."

We present here the methods for developing historical (1938–2020) maps of all three of these critical drivers, which can be used to analyze the immense changes as agriculture has intensified with more nutrient inputs and irrigation and less crop diversity. The data can also be used to drive models including those that estimate water quality. 
 Land use-land cover, nutrient inputs from fertilizer and manure, and irrigation are primary anthropogenic drivers of ecosystem functioning and degradation. Historical datasets covering these drivers at various spatial resolutions are essential for analyzing changes in these drivers as well as for input to models that estimate ecosystem outcomes such as water quality and runoff. We describe a new dataset for the conterminous United States (CONUS) – the Harmonized Land Nutrient Irrigation Dataset (HLNID) – that leverages existing datasets both at the county-scale (e.g., Census of Agriculture) and higher resolution land change model outputs (e.g., FORE-SCE) and remotely-sensed products (e.g., NLCD, CDL) to produce annual land use-land cover (including crop type), fertilizer and manure nutrient mass (nitrogen and phosphorus), and irrigation extent for the years 1938–2020. The flexible method can provide data at a range of custom spatial resolutions but we present results at 48 and 250 arc-seconds. The dataset reveals specific changes such as the increase in corn and soybean (replacing small grains and pasture) in the northern Great Plains since the 1990s, the spatial concentration of manure production in certain regions such as the uplands of the Southern Seaboard, and the expansion of irrigation in regions such as the Prairie Gateway.

Metrics are defined for warming response to cumulative emissions and for the cessation of emissions or ramp-down to net-zero and net-negative levels. Results indicate that previous concentration-driven experiments may have overstated the Zero Emissions Commitment due to emissions rates exceeding historical levels. 
 The proportionality between global mean temperature and cumulative emissions of CO2 predicted in Earth system models (ESMs) is the foundation of carbon budgeting frameworks. Deviations from this behavior could impact estimates of required net-zero timings and negative emissions requirements to meet the Paris Agreement climate targets. However, existing ESM diagnostic experiments do not allow for direct estimation of these deviations as a function of defined emissions pathways. Here, we perform a set of climate model diagnostic experiments for the assessment of transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE), the Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC), and climate reversibility metrics in an emissions-driven framework. The emissions-driven experiments provide consistent independent variables simplifying simulation, analysis and interpretation, with emissions rates more comparable to recent levels than existing protocols using model-specific compatible emissions from the CMIP DECK 1pctCO2  experiment, where emissions rates tend to increase during the experiment, such that at the time of CO2 doubling in year 70, emissions are much greater than present-day values. A base experiment, “esm-flat10”, has constant emissions of CO2 of 10 GtC per year (near-present-day values), and initial results show that the TCRE estimated in this experiment is about 0.1 K less than that obtained using 1pctCO2. A subset of ESMs exhibit land carbon sinks that saturate during this experiment. A branch experiment, esm-flat10-zec, illustrates that both positive and negative ZEC effects are less pronounced under esm-flat10 than under 1pctCO2 – the magnitude of ZEC50 in ESMs is, on average, reduced by 30 % compared with 1pctCO2 branch experiments. A final experiment, esm-flat10-cdr, assesses climate reversibility under negative emissions, where we find that peak warming may occur before or after net zero and that the asymmetry in temperature at a given level of cumulative emissions between the positive and negative emissions phases is well described by ZEC in most models. Further, we find that existing probabilistic simple climate model (SCM) ensembles tend to overestimate temperature reversibility compared with ESMs, highlighting the need for additional constraints. We propose a set of climate diagnostic indicators to quantify various aspects of climate reversibility. These experiments were suggested as potential candidates in CMIP7 and have since been adopted as “fast track” simulations."

The model is described in detail and evaluated against grid-resolved urban canopy simulations, demonstrating its ability to model urban surfaces accurately. By bridging the gap between computational efficiency and physical detail, PALM-SLUrb broadens PALM's potential for urban climate research. 
 Urban areas are recognised as critical zones for climate research due to the high number of people living in these areas and their significant impacts on local and regional climates. However, understanding urban boundary layer processes remains a challenge, as existing mesoscale models cannot resolve their fine-scale features and dynamics, while microscale fluid dynamics simulations remain computationally expensive or unfeasible for the full extent of the urban atmosphere. To address this gap, we present PALM-SLUrb, a single-layer urban canopy model for the PALM model system, offering a computationally efficient and physics-based model to represent urban surfaces on non-building-resolving grids. Together with the model description, we present sensitivity tests and a model comparison against grid-resolved urban canopies to demonstrate the model's performance. The results demonstrate the model's ability to extend the representation of key urban–atmosphere interactions in PALM to coarser grid resolutions on the order of 10 m.

Numerical experiments presented in this paper indicate that mid- and high-latitude low-level stratus occurring under weak turbulence is a key cloud regime for investigating the causes of these very low cloud droplet number concentrations in E3SMv2. 
 The E3SMv2 model, like various other global models that include representations of aerosol–cloud interactions, uses an empirically chosen lower bound on the simulated in-cloud cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) to help constrain the effective radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols, ERFaer.  This study identifies where ultra-low CDNCs (i.e., concentrations lower than 10 cm−3) occur in the stratiform and shallow convective clouds simulated by E3SMv2 and which of the occurrences have the strongest impact on ERFaer. Process-level analyses are presented to reveal characteristics of the cloud droplet formation and removal processes associated with impactful ultra-low CDNCs.Simulations performed with present-day emissions show that ultra-low CDNCs are most frequently found over the mid- and high-latitude oceans in both hemispheres, while the occurrences are also frequent in polluted continental regions despite the high aerosol concentrations.  Ultra-low CDNCs with the largest impacts on the simulated regional and global mean ERFaer are found in the lower troposphere in the Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. These cases are typically associated with large cloud fractions, strong water vapor condensation, weak turbulence, and lack of cloud droplet nucleation from aerosol activation.  Under such atmospheric conditions, boosting aerosol activation and enhancing turbulent mixing of cloud droplet number can increase the simulated CDNCs, although the magnitude of the global mean ERFaer increases undesirably.  The reason for this model behavior is discussed.  Overall, our study suggests that mid- and high-latitude low-level stratus occurring under weak turbulence is a cloud regime worth further investigating for the purpose of identifying and addressing the root causes of ultra-low CDNCs and strong ERFaer in E3SM."

This article introduces a new computer model that combines a land surface model (SWAT+) and a groundwater model (MODFLOW) and shows how it can be applied to managed, irrigated watersheds. This new model can be used for regions that rely on both surface water and groundwater for drinking water, agriculture, and industry. 
 Coupled surface-subsurface hydrologic models are used worldwide to study historical patterns of water storage and hydrologic behaviour, investigate the impact of management strategies on water resources, and quantify the impact of changing climate, population, and policies. This study presents a new hydrologic model to simulate surface and subsurface in a physically based spatially distributed manner by linking the popular SWAT+ and MODFLOW modelling codes. Within this new code, SWAT+ simulates processes in the landscape, soils, channels, and reservoirs, whereas MODFLOW simulation groundwater processes and interaction with land surface features (soil, channels, canals, reservoirs, tile drains). Geographic connections between SWAT+ objects and MODFLOW grid cells are established a priori using a GIS and then read into the code to be used throughout the simulation to map hydrologic fluxes (recharge, soil water transfer, groundwater-channel exchange, canal seepage, tile drainage outflow, groundwater-reservoir exchange, pumping for irrigation) on a daily time step. The use and general accuracy of the model is demonstrated for two study regions that are subject to irrigation management: the Arkansas River Basin in Colorado and the San Joaquin River Basin in California. An accompanying tutorial and example model data allow for easy use of the model to other study regions. As both SWAT+ and MODFLOW are widely used worldwide for watershed and groundwater modelling, we expect that this new tool can be an important asset in many water resources projects."

Recognizing this limitation, the lack of a robust and physically interpretable tool for assessing prediction reliability has become a critical bottleneck. In this work, the composition and photophysical inconsistencies among fluorescent compounds underlying the same fluorophore signal were identified as key sources of predictive inaccuracy. To detect these inconsistencies, fluorescence quenching was incorporated into EEM analysis with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Apparent F0/F─the ratio of PARAFAC component intensity before and after extrinsic quencher addition─was proposed as an indicator for model failure and treatment anomaly detection. Validations with both model compound mixtures and real-world greywater samples showed that shifts in apparent F0/F reflect changes in the relationship between Fmax and target concentrations of total cell count (TCC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Two practical tools were developed based on apparent F0/F: a clustering method for post hoc chemical composition analysis, and a thresholding method for outlier detection in real-time monitoring.

We applied both nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on the same nontargeted chemical data set to compare their different interpretations of environmental sources. Weekly nontargeted data was collected from the Fall Creek Monitoring Station (Ithaca, NY), where daily samples were previously analyzed using source-defined models. NMF was first used to decompose the full nontargeted chemical data set into a small set of chemical factors representing distinct composition profiles. Each factor was  then interpreted through (1) Spearman correlations with watershed characteristics (e.g., temperature, flow) and (2) suspect screening of high-weighted nontargeted features. In addition to confirming known anthropogenic inputs, our analysis revealed potential novel sources associated with snowmelt, groundwater seepage, and seasonal hydrological dynamics. We also detected an annual shift in the chemical composition, highlighting the evolving influence of these sources.

Our group has previously shown that illuminated road dust is a source of singlet oxygen, an important environmental oxidant. Here, we report the singlet oxygen steady state concentration ([1O2]ss) of illuminated aqueous suspensions and aqueous extracts of road dust samples collected from three different road types (local, arterial, and expressway) in Toronto, Canada.

The median singlet oxygen apparent quantum yield of the road dust extracts is 5.4% (UV-A), which is more than double the median reported values (UV-A) for river, lake, soil and wastewater samples.

Previous bottom-up NH3 inventories are usually constrained by satellite observations, deposition measurements, or isotopic analysis and still lack careful validation at fine regional scales. This study develops a novel diagnostic framework combining multisite NH3 observations across the Pearl River Delta (PRD) with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations and machine learning techniques to evaluate and refine a regional NH3 inventory. Our analysis indicates that the inventory overestimates agricultural emissions, particularly during the wet period, while underestimating nonagricultural sources. Underrepresented precipitation effects were a key driver of overestimated agricultural emissions (∼19% during the wet period). Conversely, a natural experiment during the Spring Festival holiday provided strong evidence that vehicle emissions are a key underestimated nonagricultural source. Adjusting the inventory based on these findings (agricultural sources reduced 39% (31%) during wet (dry) periods, nonagricultural sources increased 70%) improved NH3(g) simulations across the PRD.

We observed significant positive associations between phospholipid membrane-water partition coefficient (log KMW) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylate (PFCA) chain length on bioaccumulation across most biological matrices, demonstrating that these chemical parameters are predictive of PFAS bioaccumulation potential in the field. Our research reveals important differences in aquatic versus terrestrial exposure for certain PFAS and that biological processes (e.g., trophic interactions and metamorphosis) and chemical properties (e.g., chain length, log KMW, and concentration) control PFAS uptake, bioaccumulation, and transfer in linked freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems."

High-resolution metabolomics offers a promising approach to examine how TRAP influences infant health. However, few studies have focused on Black and Latino populations, who are disproportionately exposed to TRAP. This study aims to assess the association between prenatal exposure to TRAP and the infant metabolome in two distinct, geographically independent populations: the prospective Atlanta African American Cohort and the Southern California Mother’s Milk Study (MMS). This study provides novel evidence that prenatal nitrogen oxides (NOx), a major component of TRAP, are associated with perturbations in the infant circulating and fecal metabolome during the first month of life. We found that prenatal NOx exposure was linked with the intensity of 8 and 16 level-1 metabolites in the ATL AA and MMS, respectively. Metabolites associated with NOx included several involved in lipid and xenobiotic metabolism. In analyses including untargeted metabolic features, we found that prenatal NOx was associated with perturbations in metabolic pathways including oxidative stress and inflammatory response. These findings provide novel insight into the biological mechanisms by which prenatal TRAP may influence infant health and development."

However, the effect of water temperature on the degradation rates is unknown, limiting projections of lifetime across space and time. Here, we incubated CDA-based materials (film, foam, and straw), paper straws, polyethylene (PE) films, and poly(butylene adipate terephthalate) (PBAT) straws for 28 weeks at 10 and 20 °C in continuous-flow seawater mesocosms. The relative mass loss of the CDA film, foam, and straw increased by 20–25% from 10 to 20 °C, and their degradation rates increased by 1.8–3.1-fold. Accordingly, model predictions of CDA-based article lifetimes in North American coastal waters were highly sensitive to differences in water temperature across latitude and seasonality. Paper straws also showed a notable temperature dependence, with degradation rates increasing 1.7-fold from 10 to 20 °C. PE films and PBAT straws showed no measurable degradation at either temperature, highlighting their persistence in the ocean. Microbial communities implicated in CDA biodegradation were influenced by the material type, temperature, and incubation time. Differential abundance analysis revealed that ∼93% (29/31) of the highly responsive microbial taxa implicated in the degradation of CDA were unique at 10 and 20 °C. These findings indicate that water temperature governs the lifetime of biodegradable materials, supporting its inclusion as a primary variable in experimental frameworks moving forward."

We derived RPFs for four trihalomethanes (THMs) and nine haloacetic acids (HAAs) from published animal developmental bioassays using benchmark dose models at 10% responses, estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for RPF-weighted quintile 5 (vs 1) DBP mixture sums, and compared the RPF-weighted and unweighted aORs. RPFs were generally higher for brominated DBP species (e.g., HAA RPF10s from mouse whole embryo culture dysmorphogenesis data: monobromoacetic acid [MBAA] = 1.00, trichloroacetic acid [TCAA] = 0.0011, and dichloroacetic acid [DCAA] = 0.0005), which occurred at lower concentrations than chlorinated species. For THM mixtures, aORs changed <10% with RPF weighting, except for TOF (+19%) for the sum of brominated THMs (tribromomethane + bromodichloromethane + dibromochloromethane). We detected >10% aOR changes for HAA3 (TCAA + DCAA + dibromoacetic acid) with TOF and OGD; HAA5 (HAA3 + monochloroacetic acid + MBAA) with ASD, TOF, and OGD; HAA6 (all brominated HAAs) with TOF; and HAA9 (HAA5 + tribromoacetic acid + bromochloroacetic acid + bromodichloroacetic acid + dibromochloroacetic acid) with OGD.

Yet, selective removal of contaminants while retaining essential minerals remains a critical challenge for cost-effective water treatment processes. Here, we employed ammonia bicarbonate (AB) as an economical additive to modify interfacial polymerization (IP) for developing high-performance NF membranes suitable for drinking water applications. Comprehensive characterization coupled with molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that AB modulates the IP process through three mechanisms: (1) controlling the diffusion kinetics of piperazine (PIP) at the aqueous–organic interface, (2) the reaction between HCO3– and H+ produced by IP achieves nanofoaming, and (3) the thermal decomposition of AB releases additional gaseous products (NH3 and CO2), enhancing the dual nanofoaming effect. This controlled reaction kinetics and increased nanobubble formation produced a thinner, more wrinkled PA selective layer with an optimized microstructure. The optimized NF-AB-8 membrane demonstrated enhanced permeance (28.5 LMH/bar) during actual surface water purification, while maintaining selective separation between minerals and dissolved organic matter (KCa2+/DOM = 34.5). In addition, the improved microstructure and separation performance enhanced the antiscaling and antifouling properties of the NF membrane. This study explored the application of dual-nanofoaming mechanisms in NF membranes, providing insights for designing NF membranes that simultaneously improve permeance and selectivity, which may promote the preparation of high-performance NF membranes and their application in drinking water production."

This unified analysis identifies the well-documented cooking organic aerosol (COA, ∼21% of total OA) and, importantly, extracts cooking-emitted VOCs through COA constraints. The extracted VOC profile is corroborated well by direct kitchen cooking experiments. Our results show that cooking emissions constitute ∼7% of total atmospheric VOC mixing ratio. Further analysis demonstrates that cooking-emitted VOCs contribute to both secondary pollution formation and health risks. These environmental impacts have been largely overlooked in previous ambient VOC assessments due to the failure to identify cooking-emitted VOCs. These findings challenge the conventional practice of venting cooking emissions outdoors to protect indoor air quality, suggesting the necessity of an end-of-pipe treatment for cooking exhaust.

We find that the impact of 2001–2021's atmospheric CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ increase on terrestrial C (+39.4 PgC) opposes and far outweighs the impact of climate trends over this period (− ${-}$10.5 PgC). Globally, C gains are mostly attributable to live biomass growth (+31.2 PgC), while CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐induced dead organic C gains (+7.8 PgC) are compensated by climate‐induced losses (− ${-}$8.8 PgC). The distribution of compensating dead C changes induces an aggregate shift in dead C from high‐ and mid‐latitudes (− ${-}$3.5 PgC) to tropical ecosystems (+2.6 PgC). We additionally find global residence time reductions attributable to CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ (− ${-}$2.6%) and climate (− ${-}$1.3%) reflected across latitudes, irrespective of reservoir C changes. In aggregate, these changes reveal an acceleration and redistribution of terrestrial C stores in response to CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ and climate trends, which together reflect a gradual but fundamental reorganization of the terrestrial C cycle.

Our results show that sediment supply variability has a stronger impact than magnitude: increased variability leads to much thicker channel‐belt deposits and elevated yet alternating high and low down‐valley slopes. In contrast, greater total sediment supply results in only slightly thicker channel‐belt deposits and uniformly elevated down‐valley slopes.

This study investigates whether these impacts can be reversed by removing atmospheric greenhouse gases. Using carbon dioxide removal experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we identify considerable inter‐model diversity in projections of Antarctic sea ice recovery, partly driven by a positive feedback loop starting from different initial ocean stratification in the present climate. Specifically, during the CO2 increasing period, models with stronger initial stratification tend to store heat in the upper layer but not in the deeper layer in the Antarctic Ocean, accelerating sea ice melting, which in turn strengthens ocean stratification and thus impedes sea ice recovery during the CO2 decreasing period. Conversely, weaker stratification promotes sea ice recovery under carbon dioxide removal scenarios. This demonstrates that the initial ocean stratification intensity exerts a critical influence on the reversibility of Antarctic sea ice loss."

Here, they show that these embryos self-organize in an unusual way to pattern the body axes. 
 Since Hans Driesch’s pioneering work in 1891, it has been known that animal embryos can develop into complete individuals even when divided. However, the developmental processes and molecular mechanisms enabling this self-organization remain poorly understood. In this study, we revisit Driesch’s experiments by examining the development of isolated 2-cell stage blastomeres in the sea urchin, Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus. Contrary to intact embryos, these isolated blastomeres initially form a flat, single layer of dividing cells that eventually round up to be a blastula. Live imaging and knockdown experiments reveal that actomyosin activity at the basal side of the cells and septate junctions drives this process. Intriguingly, we observed temporal disorganization of the anterior-posterior (A-P) and dorsal-ventral (D-V) axes, where the original A-P poles come into contact after sphere shape formation. The disrupted A-P axis is subsequently corrected as the embryos employ the Wnt/β-catenin signaling mechanisms assumed to be used in intact embryos to re-establish a normal axis. These findings suggest that axis re-organization through pre-existing developmental mechanisms is essential for the successful regulative development of divided embryos. Experiments from over a century ago showed that dividing sea urchin embryos at the 2-cell stage yields two embryos, but the mechanisms of this phenomenon have not been shown.

 The distribution of tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) shows remarkable inter-individual heterogeneity, including hemispheric asymmetry. However, the factors driving this asymmetry remain poorly understood. Here we explore whether tau asymmetry is linked to i) reduced inter-hemispheric brain connectivity (potentially restricting tau spread), or ii) asymmetry in amyloid-beta (Aβ) distribution (indicating greater hemisphere-specific vulnerability to AD pathology). We include 452 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort with evidence of both Aβ pathology (CSF Aβ42/40 or neocortical Aβ-PET) and tau pathology (temporal tau-PET), categorising them as left asymmetric (n = 102), symmetric (n = 306), or right asymmetric (n = 44) based on temporal lobe tau-PET uptake distribution. We assess edge-wise inter-hemispheric functional (RSfMRI; n = 318) and structural connectivity (dMRI; n = 352) but find no association between tau asymmetry and connectivity. In contrast, we observe a strong association between tau and Aβ laterality patterns based on PET uptake (n = 233; β = 0.632, p < 0.001), which we replicate in three independent cohorts (n = 234; β = 0.535, p < 0.001). In a longitudinal Aβ-positive sample, we show that baseline Aβ asymmetry predicts progression of tau laterality over time (n = 289; β = 0.025, p = 0.028). These findings suggest that tau asymmetry is not associated with a weaker inter-hemispheric connectivity but might reflect hemispheric differences in vulnerability to Aβ pathology, underscoring the role of regional vulnerability in determining the distribution of AD pathology. Asymmetrical distribution of tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease is linked to asymmetrical amyloid-beta deposition, not reduced brain connectivity, suggesting regional vulnerability plays a key role in determining the distribution of tau pathology."

 The nature of the dominant pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated.

 Light-induced magnetisation switching is one of the most intriguing and promising areas where an ultrafast phenomenon can be utilised in technological applications. So far, experiment and theory have considered the origin of all-optical helicity-independent magnetisation switching (AO-HIS) in individual magnetic films only as a microscopically local, thermally-driven process of angular momentum transfer between different subsystems. Here, we demonstrate that this local picture is insufficient and that AO-HIS must also be regarded as a spatially inhomogeneous process along the depth within a few-nanometre thin magnetic layer. Two regions of opposite magnetisation directions are observed, separated by a highly mobile boundary, which propagates along the depth of a 9.4 nm thin Gd25Co75 alloy. The dynamics of this transient boundary determines the final magnetisation state as well as the speed of AO-HIS throughout the entire magnetic layer. The ability to understand the influence of nanoscale and transient inhomogeneities on ultrafast switching phenomena and more generally on phase transitions will open new routes for material design and excitation scenarios in future devices for transferring and storing information. The authors reveal that even within a few-nanometre thin films, ultrafast all-optical magnetisation switching is spatially inhomogeneous along the depth and driven by the picosecond propagation of a transient domain boundary."

Here, the authors show that species with both high occupancy decades ago and increasing native occupancy ever since are more likely to become naturalized elsewhere. 
 Due to anthropogenic pressure some species have declined whereas others have increased within their native ranges. Simultaneously, many species introduced by humans have established self-sustaining populations elsewhere (i.e. have become naturalized aliens). Previous studies have shown that particularly plant species that are common within their native range have become naturalized elsewhere. However, how changes in native distributions correlate with naturalization elsewhere is unknown. We compare data on grid-cell occupancy of native vascular plant species over time for 10 European regions (countries or parts thereof). For nine regions, both early occupancy and occupancy change correlate positively with global naturalization success (quantified as naturalization in any administrative region and as the number of such regions). In other words, many plant species spreading globally as naturalized aliens are also expanding within their native regions. This implies that integrating data on native occupancy dynamics in invasion risk assessments might help prevent new invasions. How changes in species’ native occupancy over time relate to global naturalization success remains unclear. Here, the authors show that species with both high occupancy decades ago and increasing native occupancy ever since are more likely to become naturalized elsewhere."

 The quantification and mapping of important soil properties, such as soil texture, are vital for effective crop management and the assessment of overall soil health in agricultural systems. In this study, we propose a multi-modal Visual Transformer (MMVT) architecture to predict and map the soil particle size distribution of agricultural topsoils in Germany at a high spatial resolution of 10 meters. Our modeling utilized multi-source bare soil satellite image composites with terrain and soil-related covariates. To optimize the model’s ability to capture spatial soil context, various image sizes were evaluated. The study findings highlighted the effectiveness of our MMVT model, demonstrating improved estimation accuracies compared to a two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D CNN) and a Random Forest (RF) model. Specifically, the proposed transformer network achieved the highest averaged validated accuracy in predicting the soil texture when incorporating a contextual image surrounding of 320 × 320 m around the soil sampling positions (Sand: R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 14.78%, and RPIQ = 3.52, Silt: R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 12.36%, and RPIQ = 3.50, Clay: R2 = 0.52, RMSE = 6.30%, and RPIQ = 1.95).

 Accurate quantification of aboveground biomass (AGB) in heterogeneous forest ecosystems is critical for reliable carbon cycle modeling and the effective climate policy development. Although remote sensing-assisted methods have significantly enhanced estimation efficiency, the impact of forest type stratification on estimation accuracy remains insufficiently investigated, especially when classified forest types from remote sensing data are used. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison between model-assisted (MA) and model-based (MB) estimators and conventional simple random sampling (SRS) estimators under three different stratified or nonstratified scenarios: (A) a nonstratified estimation framework; (B) stratified estimation employing error-free forest type maps; and (C) stratified estimation predicated on classification results from remote sensing. Additionally, we assessed the effect of model specification—whether using a general model or strata-specific models—on estimation accuracy within stratified frameworks. The results showed that both the MA and MB estimators outperformed the SRS estimator. Stratification with ground truth reference maps significantly enhanced estimation accuracy, especially for the variance of the MB estimator employing strata-specific models is reduced from 13.65 t/ha to 10.42 t/ha, with the highest relative efficiency (RE = 2.95) achieved by the error-free stratified MA estimator using a general model. However, classification errors in remote sensing-derived maps substantially reduced these benefits, often leading to estimation variances exceeding those of the unstratified approach. Specifically, the variances of estimators MA and MB have increased from 8.89 t/ha to 24.17 t/ha, and from 10.42 t/ha to 23.65 t/ha, respectively. The predominant source of error was model misassignment due to misclassified forest types. This study provides a practical framework for estimating regional forest AGB using remote sensing data and offers decision support for the scientific formulation of forest management and sustainable utilization plans."

 In the context of urbanisation and growing disparities, timely and detailed spatial data on income inequality in cities is essential. We combined satellite imagery with streetlevel photographs provided by Google Street View to reveal the spatial distribution of household income. For this, we suggest a harmonised framework for median household income modelling based on deconstructing landscape patterns using a machine-learning approach, applied across three ’global cities’: Amsterdam, New York, and Sydney. First, we classified Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 mosaics and Google Street View scenes to detect functional elements of the built environment. Second, we calculated spatial indices for Sentinel imagery and visual indices for Google Street View scenes to characterise the urban landscape. Third, by combining various indicators, we trained city-specific income prediction models according to ground truth census data. The correlation between actual and predicted income in New York and Sydney reached 0.76 and 0.78, respectively. The accuracy of income prediction in Amsterdam reached 51.13%. We revealed relationships between spatial indicators of landscape patterns and spatial income distribution and recommend using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery as the primary data choice for income modelling in datarestricted regions.

 Dust aerosols, primarily originating from arid and semi-arid regions, exert substantial influence on cloud radiative forcing (CRF) by altering cloud microphysical properties and radiative transfer processes. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) was employed to quantify the impacts of dust aerosols on CRF over the Chinese mainland from 2000 to 2020. Scenario-based experiments indicated that dust aerosols reduce the cooling effect of shortwave CRF at both the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the surface (SUR), with annual averages reduced by up to 0.20 ± 0.07 W m−2 and 0.18 ± 0.07 W m−2, respectively. Similarly, the heating effect of longwave CRF is weakened by up to 0.89 W m−2 at SUR and 0.19 W m−2 at TOA. Within the atmosphere, dust aerosols enhanced longwave heating by up to 0.71 W m−2, although their effects on shortwave forcing are more variable. These effects are most pronounced in northern and southwestern China, with stronger impacts observed during spring and summer.

 The interaction between aerosol particles and thunderstorm evolution and properties is complex and was studied by direct observational campaigns, remote sensing from space and through numerical simulations. Aerosols invigorate convection and can lead to enhanced charging manifested in more lightning, but they can also lead to a “Boomerang Effect” where too large concentrations of particles lead to diminished vertical development and weaker electrical activity. The effects of ship exhaust on ocean cloudiness have been studied intensively in recent years, following the discovery of prolonged ship tracks in oceanic regions where maritime transportation is most heavy, leading to large-scale changes in albedo and reduced precipitation. Recently it was shown that aerosols emitted by ships also tend to increase lightning activity, by modifying the dynamics and microphysics of clouds formed directly above the busiest shipping lanes. Here, we study the effects of ship-emitted aerosols on thunderstorms in one of the busiest shipping routes in the world: the Mediterranean Sea between the Suez Canal and the Gibraltar Straights. This region hosts hundreds of ships daily, and space observations show considerable enhancement of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and sulphate concentrations there, some from land sources and others directly related to maritime transportation. The research utilized 14 winter months of lightning detection networks data (ENTLN, from 2018 to 2022) and studied the properties of lightning with respect to sulphate concentrations and cloud properties. The results were divided between before and after the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulation change in January 2020 that curbed sulphate emissions from 3.5 % to 0.5 %. We show a marked increase in winter lightning activity over the main east-west shipping lanes. That spatial enhancement is all but gone following the reduction in sulphate emissions from ships from February 2020, and on average, clouds became shallower with a thinner charging layer, testifying to the role of aerosol particles in convective invigoration and lightning generation."

 During August 2020, record-breaking precipitation occurred over the Sichuan Basin (SCB), the highest since 1979, exceeding both the historical August average and the rainfall of July 2020. This observed inter-month precipitation evolution contrasts with the typical climatological pattern, in which precipitation rises from July to August. During this period, two extreme rainfall episodes occurred—11 to 13 August (E1) and 15 to 18 August (E2)—and E2 exhibited a more northerly-located precipitation center and higher precipitation compared to E1. These two extreme precipitation episodes accounted for 60.1 % of the total rainfall in August 2020. This study investigates the causes of inter-monthly precipitation anomalies in the SCB during July–August 2020 from the perspective of the inter-monthly difference (August minus July) and further reveals the causes of two extreme precipitation episodes. Compared to July, the enhanced and eastward-shifted South Asian High (SAH) and the northeastward-shifted Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) collectively contributed to the record-breaking precipitation over the SCB in August. The enhanced western Pacific convection and suppressed Indian Ocean convection influence precipitation through its effects on WPSH and SAH indirectly. During both extreme episodes (E1 and E2), abundant water vapor was transported from the tropical western Pacific to the SCB by the intensified WPSH. Concurrently, more moisture from the Indian Ocean resulted in more precipitation in E2. Moreover, non-adiabatic heating anomalies on the Tibetan Plateau facilitated the development of a southwest vortex, which enhanced upward motion over the SCB. All key processes can be validated by the Linear Baroclinic Model."

Short-term perturbations in one type of neurotransmission are homeostatically counteracted by the opposing type, but prolonged excitation-inhibition imbalance causes dysfunction at both single neuron and circuit levels. However, whether dysfunction in one or both types of neurotransmission leads to pathogenicity in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by select synaptic deficits is not known. Here, we used functional, morphological, and viral-mediated approaches to uncover the pathogenic contribution of unbalanced excitation-inhibition in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show that vulnerable SMA motor circuits fail to respond homeostatically to reduced excitation and instead increase inhibition. This imposes an excessive burden on motor neurons and further restricts their recruitment. Reducing inhibition genetically or pharmacologically improves neuronal function and motor behavior in SMA mice. Thus, the disruption of excitation-inhibition homeostasis is a major maladaptive mechanism that diminishes the capacity of premotor commands to recruit motor neurons and elicit muscle contractions in SMA."

Here, we identify that the talin interacting proteins DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule), and paxillin each preferentially bind to talin at a specific ECM stiffness, this interaction is preserved in the absence of tension, and the interaction is regulated through focal adhesion kinase signaling. Moreover, DLC1 regulates cardiomyocyte RhoA activity in a stiffness-dependent way, whereby the loss of DLC1 results in myofibrillar disarray. Together, this study demonstrates a mechanism of imprinting mechanical information into the talin interactome to fine-tune RhoA activity, with impacts on cardiac health and disease."

Here, we explore this question using a coupled climate model. We show that the existence of the North American continent is critical for the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon. The mechanism involves North America acting as an additional heating center, resulting in the strengthening and extension of oceanic advection toward the monsoon region. This is achieved via the Rodwell-Hoskins mechanism that strengthens the North Pacific subtropical high and through a widespread Northern Hemisphere heating that shifts the Hadly circulation subsidence center poleward. This teleconnection is independent of the presence of the Tibetan Plateau, and its impact on East Asian summer precipitation is found to be smaller but comparable to that of Tibet. The individual role of other continents outside Afro-Eurasia is found to be less important."

Recent evidence suggests that perturbation of myo-inositol (MI) plays a role in mammalian hyperglycemic regulation.

We show that MI transporters are highly conserved across birds and that dietary MI reduces fat accumulation in Anna’s hummingbirds. MI consumption by hummingbirds varies with seasonal changes in body mass, consistent with a regulatory role. Furthermore, MI enhances fatty acid oxidation in avian cells, via effects on pyruvate-dehydrogenase complexes, indicating a role in mitochondrial fuel selection. Our findings underscore the importance of MI in avian metabolism, offering insights into their evolutionary adaptations in the context of insulin insensitivity."

However, adverse events (e.g., chorioretinal atrophy) have been reported in many patients receiving subretinal injection of Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) and experimental gene therapies. Subretinal injection confines transduction to the treated area. To address this, we manufactured high-concentration fibrin hydrogels encapsulating AAV2–green fluorescent protein (AAV2-GFP). Gels had homogeneous AAV distribution, desired mechanical properties, and retained infectivity. Epiretinal placement of fibrin–AAV2-GFP(n= 11) was compared to subretinal (n= 5) and intravitreal AAV2-GFPinjection (n= 3). The subretinal group exhibited inconsistent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transduction restricted to the injection region with severe atrophy in two cases. The intravitreal group had weak transduction and inflammation. In contrast, epiretinal hydrogels degraded within days and led to broad transduction of RPE without atrophy or inflammation.

PTPN22 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling through dephosphorylation of the kinases lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and zeta-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70). The regulation of PTPN22 remains poorly understood. Here, we identify PTPN22 Ser449as a protein kinase A phosphorylation site, which is triggered by TCR engagement and is hyperphosphorylated in lupus peripheral blood cells. PTPN22 Ser449phosphorylation selectively lowered the affinity of PTPN22 for ZAP70 versus LCK but also indirectly suppressed inhibitory LCK Tyr192phosphorylation through a ZAP70-CD45 signaling axis. The resulting dephosphorylation of LCK Tyr192not only enhanced TCR signaling but also modulated pathway activation downstream the TCR. In vivo loss of PTPN22 Ser449phosphorylation reduced T cell responses and suppressed experimental lupus nephritis. These results suggest that PTPN22 Ser449phosphorylation promotes a CD45-mediated retrograde ZAP70-LCK feedback loop that enhances T cell responses and promotes autoimmunity."

CD96, an inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptor poorly studied in human CD4+T cells, was markedly down-regulated.

Herein, we report a simple and general approach for synthesizing ketonylC-glycosides. The transformation uses designed glycosyl sulfides as air- and moisture-stable precursors to glycosyl radicals, styrenes as aglycone sources, and dimethyl sulfoxide as both an oxidant and solvent, proceeding under photoredox catalysis. Glycosyl radicals are generated from glycosyl sulfides via efficient unimolecular homolytic substitution. This approach obviates harsh conditions for donor activation and the use of activated aglycone precursors, accommodating extensive functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction also exhibits high stereoselectivity across various glycosyl units.

Adult diaphyseal aging was accompanied by the disproportionate rate between a faster increase in the medullary area and an absent or marginal increase in the total area. This indicates that subperiosteal apposition did not fully biomechanically compensate for the medullary expansion.

The framework integrates a segmentation module for accurate voxel-based vessel delineation with a surface deformation module that performs anatomically consistent and unsupervised surface refinements guided by medical image data. The integrated pipeline addresses key limitations of existing methods, enhancing geometric accuracy and computational efficiency. Evaluated on public datasets, it achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while substantially reducing manual effort and processing time. The resulting vascular models exhibit anatomically accurate and visually realistic geometries, effectively capturing both primary vessels and intricate branching patterns. In conclusion, this work advances the scalability and reliability of image-based computational modeling, facilitating broader applications in clinical and research settings."

We examined associations between PHD adherence and risks of mortality and chronic diseases using data from two prospective cohorts—the US NHANES (1999–2018, 42,947 participants) and the UKB (125,372 participants)—and a meta-analysis of 37 published cohort studies (3,244,263 participants). Higher adherence to PHD was associated with lower all-cause mortality in both cohorts. In the UKB, it was also associated with reduced the risk of cancer and respiratory disease mortality. In the meta-analysis, higher adherence to the PHD was associated with lower risks of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and reduced risks of colorectal cancer, lung cancer, CVDs, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. This analysis suggests that higher adherence to the PHD may offer substantial health benefits."

Here, we confirm a fission event in one zokor species through multiple-omics and functional analyses. We traced this event to a mutation in a splicing enhancer of the DNA repair geneAplfin the fission-bearing species, which caused exon skipping and produced a truncated protein that disrupted DNA repair. An intronic deletion inDna2, known to facilitate neo-telomere formation when knocked out, reduced gene activity. These variants collectively drove chromosomal fission in this zokor species. The newly formed chromosome became fixed due to carrying essential genes and strong selective pressure. While geographic isolation likely initiated the divergence of this species and the sister one, the fission event and associated decline at the chromosome level in gene flow probably exacerbated the speciation process. Our work elucidates the genetic basis of chromosomal fission and underscores its role in speciation dynamics."

Birkinshaw,Computational design of potent and selective binders of BAK and BAX,"Potent and selective binders of the key proapoptotic proteins BAK and BAX have not been described. We use computational protein design to generate high affinity binders of BAK and BAX with greater than 100-fold specificity for their target. Both binders activate their targets when at low concentration, driving pore formation, but inhibit membrane permeabilization when in excess. Crystallography shows that the BAK binder induces BAK unfolding, exposing the α6 helix and BH3 domain. Together, these data suggest that upon binding, BAK or BAX unfold; at high binder concentrations, self-association of the partially folded BAK or BAX proteins is blocked and the membrane remains intact, whereas at low concentrations, dimers form, and the membrane ruptures. Our designed binders modulate apoptosis via direct, specific interactions with BAK and BAX and reveal that for therapeutic strategies targeting BAK and BAX, inhibition requires saturating binder concentrations at the site of action."
