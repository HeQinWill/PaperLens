10.5194/acp-24-10849-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了中国地区 PM2.5 和氧化潜势 (OP) 的时空变化及其与气象条件和排放源的关系。研究使用了丹麦欧拉半球模型 (DEHM) 和天气研究与预报 (WRF) 模型，分析了 PM2.5 和 OP 的变化趋势，并评估了气象条件和排放源的影响。结果表明，气象条件和排放源分别对 PM2.5 浓度和 OP 的变化贡献了 46% 和 54%，其中二次气溶胶形成和生物质燃烧是 PM2.5 和 OP 水平的主要贡献者。该研究通过数值模拟方法，探讨了 PM2.5 和 OP 的时空分布特征，并分析了影响其变化的主要因素，为中国大气环境质量改善提供了科学依据。,"['air quality monitoring', 'PM2.5', 'oxidative potential', 'aerosol', 'meteorology', 'emission']",Jiemei Liu;Jesper H. Christensen;Zhuyun Ye;Shikui Dong;Camilla Geels;Jørgen Brandt;Athanasios Nenes;Yuan Yuan;Ulas Im,Impact of meteorology and aerosol sources on PM2.5 and oxidative potential variability and levels in China,"China was chosen as an example to conduct a quantitative analysis using the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) system with meteorological input from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Meteorological conditions and emission inventories contributed 46 % (65 %) and 54 % (35 %) to the variations in PM2.5 concentrations (oxidative potential – OP), respectively, highlighting secondary aerosol formation and biomass burning as the primary contributors to PM2.5 and OP levels. 
 China has long-term high PM2.5 levels, and its oxidative potential (OP) is worth studying as it may unravel the impacts of aerosol pollution on public health better than PM2.5 alone. OP refers to the ability of PM2.5 to induce oxidative stress (OS). OP and PM2.5 are influenced by meteorological factors, anthropogenic emission sources, and atmospheric aging. Although their impact on PM2.5 has been studied, OP measurements only recently became available and on a limited scale, as they require considerable technical expertise and resources. For this, the joint relationship between PM2.5 and OP for a wide range of meteorological conditions and emission profiles remain elusive. Towards this, we estimated PM2.5 and OP over China using the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) system with meteorological input from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. It was found that higher values of PM2.5 and OP were primarily concentrated in urban agglomerations in the central and eastern regions of China, while lower values were found in the western and northeastern regions. Furthermore, the probability density function revealed that about 40 % of areas in China had annual average PM2.5 concentrations exceeding the Chinese concentration limit. For OP, 36 % of the regions have OP below 1 nmolmin-1m-3, 41 % have OP between 1 and 2 nmolmin-1m-3, and 23 % have OP above 2 nmolmin-1m-3, which are in line with previous measurement studies. Analysis of the simulations indicates that meteorological conditions contributed 46 % and 65 % to PM2.5 concentrations and OP variability, respectively, while anthropogenic emissions contributed 54 % and 35 % to PM2.5 concentrations and OP variability, respectively. The emission sensitivity analysis also highlighted the fact that PM2.5 and OP levels are mostly determined by secondary aerosol formation and biomass burning."

Giangrande;Thiago S. Biscaro;Ann Fridlind;Scott Braun,A thermal-driven graupel generation process to explain dry-season convective vigor over the Amazon,"Using computer simulations and real measurements, we discovered that storms over the Amazon were narrower but more intense during the dry periods, producing heavier rain and more ice particles in the clouds. Our research showed that cumulus bubbles played a key role in creating these intense storms. This study can improve the representation of the effect of continental and ocean environments on tropical regions' rainfall patterns in simulations. 
 Large-eddy simulations (LESs) are conducted for each day of the intensive observation periods (IOPs) of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon) field campaign to characterize the updrafts and microphysics within deep convective cores while contrasting those properties between Amazon wet and dry seasons. Mean Doppler velocity (Vdop) values simulated using LESs are compared with 2-year measurements from a radar wind profiler (RWP) as viewed by statistical composites separated according to wet- and dry-season conditions. In the observed RWP and simulated LES Vdop composites, we find more intense low-level updraft velocity, vigorous graupel generation, and intense surface rain during the dry periods compared with the wet periods. To investigate coupled updraft–microphysical processes further, single-day golden cases are selected from the wet and dry periods to conduct detailed cumulus thermal tracking analysis. Tracking analysis reveals that simulated dry-season environments generate more droplet-loaded low-level thermals than wet-season environments. This tendency correlates with seasonal contrasts in buoyancy and vertical moisture advection profiles in large-scale forcing. Employing a normalized time series of mean thermal microphysics, the simulated cumulus thermals appear to be the primary generator of cloud droplets. When subsequent thermals penetrate the ice crystal layer, droplets within the thermals interact with entrained ice crystals, which enhances riming in the thermals. This appears to be a production pathway of graupel/hail particles within simulated deep convective cores. In addition, less-diluted dry-case thermals tend to be elevated higher, and graupel grows further during sedimentation after spilling out from thermals. Therefore, greater concentrations of low-level moist thermals likely result in more graupel/hail production and associated dry-season convective vigor."

Palmer;Mark Lunt;Ingrid Super;Arjan Droste,Verifying national inventory-based combustion emissions of CO2 across the UK and mainland Europe using satellite observations of atmospheric CO and CO2,"Under the Paris Agreement, countries must track their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This study describes a method to determine self-consistent estimates for combustion emissions and natural fluxes of CO2 from atmospheric data. We report consistent estimates inferred using this approach from satellite data and ground-based data over Europe, suggesting that satellite data can be used to determine national anthropogenic CO2 emissions for countries where ground-based CO2 data are absent. 
 Under the Paris Agreement, countries report their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in national inventories, which are used to track progress towards mitigation goals, but they must be independently verified. Atmospheric observations of CO2, interpreted using inverse methods, can potentially provide that verification. Conventional CO2 inverse methods infer natural CO2 fluxes by subtracting a priori estimates of fuel combustion from the a posteriori net CO2 fluxes, assuming that a priori knowledge for combustion emissions is better than for natural fluxes. We describe an inverse method that uses measurements of CO2 and carbon monoxide (CO), a trace gas that is co-emitted with CO2 during combustion, to report self-consistent combustion emissions and natural fluxes of CO2. We use an ensemble Kalman filter and the GEOS-Chem atmospheric transport model to explore how satellite observations of CO and CO2 collected by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), respectively, can improve understanding of combustion emissions and natural CO2 fluxes across the UK and mainland Europe in 2018–2021. We assess the value of using satellite observations of CO2,  with and without CO, above what is already available from the in situ network. Using CO2 satellite observations leads to small corrections to a priori emissions that are inconsistent with in situ observations, due partly to the insensitivity of the atmospheric CO2 column to CO2 emission changes. When we introduce satellite CO observations, we find better agreement with our in situ inversion and a better model fit to atmospheric CO2 observations. Our regional mean a posteriori combustion CO2 emission ranges from 4.6–5.0 Gt a−1 (1.5 %–2.4 % relative standard deviation), with all inversions reporting an overestimate for Germany's wintertime emissions. Our national a posteriori CO2 combustion emissions are highly dependent on the assumed relationship between CO2 and CO uncertainties, as expected. Generally, we find better results when we use grid-scale-based a priori CO2:CO uncertainty estimates rather than a fixed relationship between the two species."

DeMott;Ottmar Möhler;Daniel J. Cziczo,Measurement report: The Fifth International Workshop on Ice Nucleation phase 1 (FIN-01): intercomparison  of single-particle mass spectrometers,"Single-particle mass spectrometry (SPMS) is commonly used to measure the chemical composition and mixing state of aerosol particles. Intercomparison of SPMS instruments was conducted. All instruments reported similar size ranges and common spectral features. The instrument-specific detection efficiency was found to be more dependent on particle size than type. All differentiated secondary organic aerosol, soot, and soil dust but had difficulties differentiating among minerals and dusts. 
 Knowledge of the chemical composition and mixing state of aerosols at a single-particle level is critical for gaining insights into atmospheric processes. One common tool to make these measurements is single-particle mass spectrometry. There remains a need to compare the performance of different single-particle mass spectrometers (SPMSs). An intercomparison of SPMSs was conducted at the Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere (AIDA) chamber at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in November 2014, as part of the first phase of the Fifth International Workshop on Ice Nucleation (FIN-01). In this paper we compare size distributions and mass spectra of atmospherically relevant particle types measured by five SPMSs. These include different minerals, desert and soil dusts, soot, bioaerosol (Snomax; protein granule), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), and SOA-coated mineral particles. Most SPMSs reported similar vacuum aerodynamic diameter (dva) within typical instrumental ranges from ∼100–200 nm (lower limit) to ∼2–3 µm (upper limit). In general, all SPMSs exhibited a wide dynamic range (up to ∼103) and high signal-to-noise ratio (up to ∼104) in mass spectra. Common spectral features with small diversities in mass spectra were found with high average Pearson's correlation coefficients, i.e., for average positive spectra ravg-pos=0.74 ± 0.12 and average negative spectra ravg-neg=0.67 ± 0.22. We found that instrument-specific detection efficiency (DE) was more dependent on particle size than particle type, and particle identification favored the use of bipolar, rather than monopolar, instruments. Particle classification from “blind experiments” showed that all instruments differentiated SOA, soot, and soil dust and detected subtle changes in the particle internal mixing but had difficulties differentiating among specific mineral types and dusts. This study helps to further understand the capabilities and limitations of the single-particle mass spectrometry technique in general and the specific performance of the instrument in characterizing atmospheric aerosol particles."

For experiments where droplets are steadily supercooled from the freezing point, our work combines nucleation theory and survival probability analysis to predict the nucleation spectrum, i.e., droplet freezing probabilities vs. temperature. We use the new framework to extract approximately consistent rate parameters from experiments with different cooling rates and droplet sizes. 
 Homogeneous nucleation is the prominent mechanism of glaciation in cirrus and other high-altitude clouds.  Ice nucleation rates can be studied in laboratory assays that gradually lower the temperature of pure water droplets.  These experiments can be performed with different cooling rates, with different droplet sizes, and often with a distribution of droplet sizes.  We combine nucleation theory, survival probability analysis, and published data on the fraction of frozen droplets as a function of temperature to understand how the cooling rate, droplet size, and size dispersity influence the nucleation rates.  The framework, implemented in the Python code AINTBAD (Analysis of Ice nucleation Temperature for B and A Determination), provides a temperature-dependent nucleation rate on a per volume basis, in terms of approximately temperature-independent prefactor (A) and barrier (B) parameters.  We find that dispersion in droplet diameters of less than an order of magnitude, if not properly included in the analysis, can cause apparent nucleation barriers to be underestimated by 50 %.  This result highlights the importance of droplet size dispersion in efforts to model  glaciation in the polydisperse droplets of clouds.  We also developed a theoretical framework, implemented in the Python code IPA (Inhomogeneous Poisson Analysis), to predict the fraction of frozen droplets at each temperature for arbitrary droplet size dispersions and cooling rates.  Finally, we present a sensitivity analysis for the effect of temperature uncertainty on the nucleation spectrum.  Our framework can improve models for ice nucleation in clouds by explicitly accounting for droplet polydispersity and cooling rates."

To overcome the limitation, extra infrared signals from GOES-R ABI are combined with TEMPEST microwave measurements. Compared with ground observations, improved humidity information is extracted from the merged TEMPEST and ABI signals. 
 The Temporal Experiment for Storms and Tropical Systems Demonstration (TEMPEST-D) demonstrated the capability of CubeSat satellites to provide high-quality, stable microwave signals for estimating water vapor, clouds, and precipitation from space. Unlike the operational NOAA and MetOp series satellites, which combine microwave and hyperspectral infrared sensors on the same platforms to optimize retrievals, CubeSat radiometers such as TEMPEST do not carry additional sensors. In such cases, the high-temporal- and spatial-resolution and multi-channel measurements from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the next-generation series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-R) are ideal for assisting these smaller, stand-alone radiometers. Based on sensitivity tests, the water vapor retrievals from TEMPEST are improved by adding water-vapor-sounding, window, and CO2 channels at 6.2, 6.9, 7.3, 8.4, 10.3, 11.2, 12.3, and 13.3 µm from ABI, which help to increase the vertical resolution of soundings and reduce retrieval errors. Adding three ABI water-vapor-sounding channels, under clear-sky conditions, retrieval biases and root mean square errors improve by approximately 10 %, while under cloudy skies, biases remain unchanged, but root mean square errors still decrease by 5 %; meanwhile, retrieval biases and root mean square errors are substantially reduced by adding more information from eight ABI bands in both clear and cloudy skies. Humidity soundings are also validated using coastal radiosonde data from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) from 2019 to 2020. When ABI indicates clear skies, water vapor retrievals improve somewhat by decreasing the overall bias in the microwave-only estimate by roughly 10 %, although layer root mean square errors remain roughly unchanged at 1 g kg−1 when three or eight ABI channels are added. When ABI indicates cloudy conditions, there is little change in the results. The small number of matched radiosondes may limit the observed improvement."

Aspects like the height of their base are of essential interest to quantify their radiative effects but remain difficult to derive from satellite data. In this study, we combine observations from the surface and satellite retrievals of cloud properties to build a robust and accurate method to retrieve the cloud base height, based on a computer vision model and ordinal regression. 
 Clouds are a crucial regulator in the Earth's energy budget through their radiative properties, both at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface; hence, determining key factors like their vertical extent is of essential interest. While the cloud top height is commonly retrieved by satellites, the cloud base height is difficult to estimate from satellite remote sensing data. Here, we present a novel method called ORABase (Ordinal Regression Auto-encoding of cloud Base), leveraging spatially resolved cloud properties from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument to retrieve the cloud base height over marine areas. A machine learning model is built with two components to facilitate the cloud base height retrieval: the first component is an auto-encoder designed to learn a representation of the data cubes of cloud properties and to reduce their dimensionality. The second component is developed for predicting the cloud base using ground-based ceilometer observations from the lower-dimensional encodings generated by the aforementioned auto-encoder. The method is then evaluated based on a collection of collocated surface ceilometer observations and retrievals from the CALIOP satellite lidar. The statistical model performs similarly on both datasets and performs notably well on the test set of ceilometer cloud bases, where it exhibits accurate predictions, particularly for lower cloud bases, and a narrow distribution of the absolute error, namely 379 and 328 m for the mean absolute error and the standard deviation of the absolute error, respectively. Furthermore, cloud base height predictions are generated for an entire year over the ocean, and global mean aggregates are also presented, providing insights into global cloud base height distributions and offering a valuable dataset for extensive studies requiring global cloud base height retrievals. The global cloud base height dataset and the presented models constituting ORABase are available from Zenodo (Lenhardt et al., 2024)."

Analysis shows that BSR provides improved accuracy and stability compared to Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (LER). These results indicate that BSR can significantly enhance climate analysis and air quality monitoring, making it a promising tool for accurate environmental satellite applications. 
 In satellite remote sensing applications, enhancing the precision of level 2 (L2) algorithms relies heavily on the accurate estimation of the surface reflectance across the ultraviolet (UV) to visible (VIS) spectrum. However, the mutual dependence between the L2 algorithms and the surface reflectance retrieval poses challenges, necessitating an alternative approach. To address this issue, many satellite algorithms generate Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (LER) products as a priori surface reflectance data; however, this often results in an underestimation of these data. This study is the first to assess the applicability of background surface reflectance (BSR), derived using a semi-empirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model, in an operational environmental satellite algorithm. This study pioneered the application of the BRDF model to hyperspectral satellite data at 440 nm, aiming to provide more realistic preliminary surface reflectance data. In this study, the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) data were used, and a comparative analysis of the GEMS BSR and GEMS LER retrieved in this study revealed an improvement in the relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) accuracy of 3 %. Additionally, a time series analysis across diverse land types indicated a greater stability exhibited by the BSR than by the LER. For further validation, the BSR was compared with other LER databases using ground-truth data, yielding superior simulation performance. These findings present a promising avenue for enhancing the accuracy of surface reflectance retrieval from hyperspectral satellite data, thereby advancing the practical applications of satellite remote sensing algorithms."

Understanding GHG flux processes and controls across various ecosystems is essential for estimating the current and future state of climate change. It was shown that using the UAV platform for such measurements is beneficial for improving our understanding of GHG processes over complex landscapes. 
 This study presents an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) platform used to resolve horizontal and vertical patterns of CO2 and CH4 mole fractions within the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer. The obtained data contribute important information for upscaling fluxes from natural ecosystems over heterogeneous terrain and for constraining hot spots of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This observational tool, therefore, has the potential to complement existing stationary carbon monitoring networks for GHGs, such as eddy covariance towers and manual flux chambers. The UAV platform is equipped with two gas analyzers for CO2 and CH4 that are connected sequentially. In addition, a 2D anemometer is deployed above the rotor plane to measure environmental parameters including 2D wind speed, air temperature, humidity, and pressure. Laboratory and field tests demonstrate that the platform is capable of providing data with reliable accuracy, with good agreement between the UAV data and tower-based measurements of CO2, H2O, and wind speed. Using interpolated maps of GHG mole fractions, with this tool we assessed the signal variability over a target area and identified potential hot spots. Our study shows that the UAV platform provides information about the spatial variability of the lowest part of the boundary layer, which to date remains poorly observed, especially in remote areas such as the Arctic. Furthermore, using the profile method, it is demonstrated that the GHG fluxes from a local sources can be calculated. Although subject to large uncertainties over the area of interest, the comparison between the eddy covariance method and UAV-based calculations showed acceptable qualitative agreement."

Our dataset is valuable for improving physics-based snow, land-surface, and hydrological models, with potential applications in similar high-alpine catchments. 
 We present a high-resolution hydrometeorological and snow dataset from the alpine Dischma watershed and its surroundings in eastern Switzerland, including station measurements of variables such as snow depth and catchment runoff. This dataset is particularly suited for different modelling experiments using distributed and process-based models, including physics-based snow and hydrological models. Additionally, the data is highly useful for testing various snow data assimilation schemes and for developing models representing snow-forest interactions. The dataset covers seven water years from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2023. The complete domain spans an area of 333 km² with altitudes ranging from 1250 to 3228 meters. The Dischma basin, with its outlet at 1671 m elevation, occupies 42.9 km². Included in the dataset are high-resolution (100 m) hourly meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation, as well as long- and shortwave radiation), land cover characteristics (primarily forest properties), and a digital elevation model. Noteworthy, the dataset includes snow depth acquisitions obtained from airborne lidar and photogrammetry surveys, constituting the most extensive spatial snow depth dataset in the European Alps. Along with these gridded datasets, we provide daily quality-controlled snow depth recordings from seven sites, biweekly snow water equivalent measurements from two locations, and hourly runoff and stream temperature observations for the Dischma watershed.

For the first time at this scale, we use differentiable physics-informed machine learning hydrologic models to simulate rainfall–runoff processes for 3753 basins around the world and compare them with purely data-driven and traditional modeling approaches. This sets a benchmark for hydrologic estimates around the world and builds foundations for improving global hydrologic simulations. 
 Accurate hydrologic modeling is vital to characterizing how the terrestrial water cycle responds to climate change. Pure deep learning (DL) models have been shown to outperform process-based ones while remaining difficult to interpret. More recently, differentiable physics-informed machine learning models with a physical backbone can systematically integrate physical equations and DL, predicting untrained variables and processes with high performance. However, it is unclear if such models are competitive for global-scale applications with a simple backbone. Therefore, we use – for the first time at this scale – differentiable hydrologic models (full name δHBV-globe1.0-hydroDL, shortened to δHBV here) to simulate the rainfall–runoff processes for 3753 basins around the world. Moreover, we compare the δHBV models to a purely data-driven long short-term memory (LSTM) model to examine their strengths and limitations. Both LSTM and the δHBV models provide competitive daily hydrologic simulation capabilities in global basins, with median Kling–Gupta efficiency values close to or higher than 0.7 (and 0.78 with LSTM for a subset of 1675 basins with long-term discharge records), significantly outperforming traditional models. Moreover, regionalized differentiable models demonstrated stronger spatial generalization ability (median KGE 0.64) than a traditional parameter regionalization approach (median KGE 0.46) and even LSTM for ungauged region tests across continents. Nevertheless, relative to LSTM, the differentiable model was hampered by structural deficiencies for cold or polar regions, highly arid regions, and basins with significant human impacts. This study also sets the benchmark for hydrologic estimates around the world and builds a foundation for improving global hydrologic simulations."

Here we show that the activation of nonvolatile soot particles during contrail formation is likely determined by the sizes of primary soot particles rather than the effective sizes of soot aggregates as assumed in previous studies, which can explain less-than-unity fractions of soot particles forming contrail ice particles as recently observed during ECLIF (Emission and CLimate Impact of alternative Fuels) campaigns. The smaller soot primary sizes compared to aggregate sizes delay the onset of contrail ice formation, increase the maximum plume supersaturation reached in the contrail plume, and thus increase the probability of small volatile particles contributing to the total contrail ice particle number. This study suggests that the range of conditions for volatile plume particles to contribute significantly to the contrail ice number budget is wider than previously thought. As the aviation industry is moving toward sustainable aviation fuel and/or lean-burning engine technology, which is expected to reduce not only the emission index of nonvolatile soot particles but also the sizes of primary soot particles, this study highlights the need to better understand how the combined changes may affect contrail formation, contribution of volatile particles, and climate impacts."

Herein, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 supported Pt nanoparticle monolithic catalyst (Pt/OM CZO) was synthesized to investigate these effects. Our findings uncover the diverse effects of SO2: Upon SO2 treatment, the coupling between the S 3p and Pt 5d orbitals promotes the Pt–O–SO3 structure in situ formed on the catalyst surface. The propene (C3H6) molecule readily binds with the oxygen atom in Pt–O–SO3, resulting in the accumulation of acetone and carbon deposition, thereby hindering C3H6 oxidation. Conversely, a cleaved oxygen atom within the Pt–O–SO3 structure enhances propane (C3H8) adsorption and activates the C–H bond, facilitating C3H8 oxidation. These insights are pivotal for advancing the frontier of sulfur-tolerant catalysts, addressing both economic and environmental challenges."

To realize the elimination of VOCs, Ru/CeO2 catalysts have been intensively investigated and applied. Although it has been widely acknowledged that the catalytic performance of platinum group metal catalysts was highly determined by their dispersion and coordination environment, the most reactive structures on Ru/CeO2 catalysts for VOCs oxidation are still ambiguous. In this work, starting from Ce-BTC (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) materials, atomically dispersed Ru catalysts and agglomerated Ru catalysts were successfully created via one-step hydrothermal method (Ru-CeO2-BTC) and conventional incipient wetness impregnation method (Ru/CeO2-BTC), respectively. In a typical model reaction of C3H6 oxidation, atomically dispersed Ruδ+ species with the formation of abundant Ru–O–Ce linkages on Ru-CeO2-BTC were found to perform much better than agglomerated RuOx species on Ru/CeO2-BTC. Further characterizations and mechanism study disclosed that Ru-CeO2-BTC catalyst with atomically dispersed Ru ions and more superior low temperature redox performance compared to Ru/CeO2-BTC could better facilitate the adsorption/activation of C3H6 and the decomposition/desorption of intermediates, thus exhibiting superior C3H6 oxidation activity.

However, information on the occurrence and fate of the highly toxic halogenated byproducts, which are produced by chlorination decolorization of the textile printing and dyeing wastewater, is very limited. In this study, the occurrence of six categories of halogenated byproducts (haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), N-nitrosamines (NAs), trihalomethanes, halogenated ketones, and halonitromethanes) was investigated along the full-scale treatment processes of textile printing and dyeing wastewater treatment plants. Furthermore, the ecological risk of the halogenated byproducts was evaluated. The results showed that the total concentration of halogenated byproducts increased significantly after chlorination. Large amounts of HAAs (average 122.1 μg/L), HANs (average 80.9 μg/L), THMs (average 48.3 μg/L), and NAs (average 2314.3 ng/L) were found in the chlorinated textile wastewater, and the results showed that the generations of HANs and NAs were positively correlated with the BIX and β/α index, indicating that the HANs and NAs might form from the microbial metabolites. In addition, HAAs and HANs exhibited high ecological risk quotients (>1), suggesting their high potential ecological risk. The results also demonstrated that most halogenated byproducts could be effectively removed by reverse osmosis treatment processes except NAs, with a lower removal rate of 18%. This study is believed to provide an important theoretical basis for controlling and reducing the ecological risks of halogenated byproducts in textile printing and dyeing wastewater effluents."

Natural organic matter (NOM) is ubiquitous in aquatic environments and plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles. However, its impact on the dissemination of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes (eARGs) under sunlight exposure remains elusive. This study reveals that environmentally relevant levels of NOM (0.1–20 mg/L) can significantly enhance the natural transformation frequency of the model bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 by up to 7.6-fold under simulated sunlight. Similarly, this enhancement was consistently observed in natural water and wastewater systems. Further mechanism analysis revealed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NOM under sunlight irradiation, primarily singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, play a crucial role in this process. These ROS induce intracellular oxidative stress and elevated cellular membrane permeability, thereby indirectly boosting ATP production and enhancing cell competence of extracellular DNA uptake and integration. Our findings highlight a previously underestimated role of natural factors in the dissemination of eARGs within aquatic ecosystems and deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between NOM, sunlight, and microbes in environmental water bodies. This underscores the importance of developing comprehensive strategies to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments."

Water quality risks include leaks of gas and salty fluids (brines) that are coproduced at wellpads. Identifying the cause of contamination is difficult, however, because UOG wells are often colocated with other contaminant sources. We investigated the world’s largest shale gas play with publicly accessible groundwater data (Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. with ∼29,000 analyses) and discovered that concentrations of brine-associated barium ([Ba]) and strontium ([Sr]) show small regional increases within 1 km of UOG development. Higher concentrations in groundwaters are associated with greater proximity to and density of UOG wells. Concentration increases are even larger when considering associations with the locations of (i) spill-related violations and (ii) some wastewater impoundments. These statistically significant relationships persist even after correcting for other natural and anthropogenic sources of salts. The most likely explanation is that UOG development slightly increases salt concentrations in regional groundwaters not because of fracking but because of the ubiquity of wastewater management issues. These results emphasize the need for stringent wastewater management practices across oil and gas operations."

Extracellular electron transfer (EET)-mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM)-coupled with humic substances reduction plays an important role in the reduction of methane emissions from wetlands, where magnetite is prevalent. However, little is known about the magnetite-mediated EET mechanisms in AOM-coupled humic substances reduction. This study shows that magnetite promotes the reduction of the AOM-coupled humic substances model compound, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS). 13CH4 labeling experiments further indicated that AOM-coupled AQDS reduction occurred, and acetate was an intermediate product of AOM. Moreover, 13CH313COONa labeling experiments showed that AOM-generated acetate can be continuously reduced to methane in a state of dynamic equilibrium. In the presence of magnetite, the EET capacity of the microbial community increased, and Methanosarcina played a key role in the AOM-coupled AQDS reduction. Pure culture experiments showed that Methanosarcina barkeri can independently perform AOM-coupled AQDS reduction and that magnetite increased its surface protein redox activity. The metatranscriptomic results indicated that magnetite increased the expression of membrane-bound proteins involved in energy metabolism and electron transfer in M. barkeri, thereby increasing the EET capacity. This phenomenon potentially elucidates the rationale as to why magnetite promoted AOM-coupled AQDS reduction."

Prior EAC studies of soils and soil constituents utilized different methods, reductants, and mediators, making cross-study comparison difficult. This study was conducted to quantify and compare the EACs of two soil constituents (hematite and Leonardite humic acid) and 12 soils of diverse composition, using chemical redox titration (CRT) with dithionite as the reductant and mediated electrochemical reduction (MER) with diquat as the mediator. The EACs of hematite and humic acid measured by CRT (EACCRT) and MER (EACMER) are similar and close to the theoretical/reported values. For soils, EACCRT and EACMER increased with iron and organic carbon (TOC) contents, suggesting iron and carbon were the main contributors to soil EAC. EACCRT > EACMER for all soils, and their difference (ΔEAC = EACCRT – EACMER) increased with TOC, presumably due to the longer contact time in CRT and thus more complete reduction of carbonaceous redox moieties. We propose an equation that relates EACCRT to EACMER (ΔEAC = 1796fTOC + 32) and another that predicts EACCRT from dithionite-reducible Fe and TOC (EACCRT = 2705 μmol e–/g C × fTOC + 17907 μmol e–/g Fe × fFedithionite-reducible).

This work investigated the impact of TCC on anaerobic sulfur transformation, especially toxic H2S production. Experimental findings revealed that TCC facilitated sulfur flow from the sludge solid phase to liquid phase, promoted sulfate reduction and sulfur-containing amino acid degradation, and largely improved anaerobic H2S production, i.e., 50–600 mg/kg total suspended solids (TSS) TCC increased the cumulative H2S yields by 24.76–478.12%. Although TCC can be partially biodegraded in anaerobic systems, the increase in H2S production can be mainly attributed to the effect of TCC rather than its degradation products. TCC was spontaneously adsorbed by protein-like substances contained in microbe extracellular polymers (EPSs), and the adsorbed TCC increased the direct electron transfer ability of EPSs, possibly due to the increase in the content of electroactive polymer protein in EPSs, the polarization of the amide group C═O bond, and the increase of the α-helical peptide dipole moment, which might be one important reason for promoting sulfur bioconversion processes. Microbial analysis showed that the presence of TCC enriched the organic substrate-degrading bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria and increased the abundances of functional genes encoding sulfate transport and dissimilatory sulfate reduction."

We show that the relationships between P* and SSTrel, and between P*, surface convergence, and SST gradients are largely constant during climate change.

10.1029/2024GL110924,True,Geophysical Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注了2024年3月北极地区总臭氧柱浓度创下历史新高，并解释了这种现象背后的原因。研究利用卫星观测数据，特别是微波边缘探测器（MLS）数据，分析了北极地区臭氧柱浓度变化趋势，发现其与行星尺度波事件导致的平流层暖化现象密切相关。这些波事件导致臭氧向极地和低层平流层输送，从而导致总臭氧柱浓度创下新高。该研究表明，平流层动力学变化对北极地区臭氧浓度具有显著影响，这对于理解和预测北极地区大气环境变化具有重要意义。,"['ozone', 'total column ozone', 'satellite observations', 'microwave limb sounder', 'stratospheric ozone', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality', 'planetary waves', 'stratospheric warming']",Paul A.

Dhomse,Record High March 2024 Arctic Total Column Ozone,"Observations of March 2024 Arctic (63°N–90°N) total column ozone set a record high of 477 Dobson Units (DU) against the 1979–2023 satellite era time series. It was about 60 DU higher than average and 6 DU higher than the previous March 1979 471 DU record. Daily Arctic ozone was above average for every day in March 2024, and set record highs from 11–26 March 2024. Microwave Limb Sounder data show this record ozone anomaly was concentrated in the lower stratosphere (10–30 km). These record values developed over the 2023–2024 winter and can be associated with vertically propagating planetary‐scale wave events that caused significant stratospheric warmings. These wave events forced poleward and downward ozone advection into the lower stratosphere, leading to record column ozone levels. The above average levels persisted through August 2024 and across the northern hemisphere."

Such multi‐layer (ML) clouds constitute major challenges in cloud observations and weather and climate modeling. This study improved a threshold algorithm for detecting ice‐over‐water ML clouds using geostationary satellites. Optimal thresholds were established for the spectral characteristics of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI), accounting for differences between land and ocean surfaces. Validation with collocated space radar and lidar measurements indicated the identification accuracies of approximately 82% over the land and 76% over the ocean. Annual distributions of ML clouds inferred by AHI and AGRI exhibited strong similarity. Furthermore, 6 years of hourly observations revealed distinct monthly and daily variations in ice‐over‐water clouds over the Asia–Pacific region. The ML cloud monthly variations were similar to those of the seasonal convection cycle, with occurrence frequencies over the typical regions higher in summer (maximum ∼27%) and lower (minimum 6%–10%) in winter. Regarding daily variations, ice‐over‐water clouds occurred more frequently around local noon over most of the six time zones (from UTC + 06 to UTC + 11) throughout all seasons. The refined spatiotemporal distribution of ML clouds, particularly the daily variations, is possible to improve our understanding of cloud vertical distributions and radiative effects, and has the potential to promote subsequent validation and parameterization of cloud overlapping in global climate modeling."

Sátori;T. Bozóki;E. Williams;E. Prácser;M. Herein;R. I. Albrecht;R. P. Beltran,How Do Schumann Resonance Frequency Changes in the Vertical Electric Field Component Reflect Global Lightning Dynamics at Different Time Scales?,"The electromagnetic waves in the Schumann resonance (SR) frequency range (<100 Hz) radiated by natural “lightning antennas” excite the Earth‐ionosphere cavity confined between the Earth's surface and the lower ionosphere. The peak frequencies of SR are known to vary with source‐observer distance (SOD), while the daily frequency range (DFR: fmax − fmin) is also indicative of the average size of thunderstorm regions. This paper provides observational evidence for these relationships based on SR frequency observations of the vertical electric (EZ) field component at Nagycenk (NCK), Hungary in Central Europe from the period 1994–2015. Variations of the peak frequencies are considered on the annual, seasonal and diurnal time scales as well as during a specific event when squall‐line formation of lightning activity in South America moves toward NCK. DFR is studied in relation to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Increasing area of lightning activity in mid‐high Northern hemisphere latitudes has been identified by DFR variations during the transition from warm to cold episodes of the ENSO in 1998 and 2010. The extension of the lightning area is considered as a consequence of energy released in the tropics and exported to higher latitudes with some months of delay from the end of the El Niño episodes. The frequency variations are interpreted via model calculations and supported with satellite‐based optical lightning observations (Optical Transient Detector, Geostationary Lightning Mapper). The described variations of SR peak frequencies and DFR yield information on the global/regional lightning dynamics and on this basis they have important application to climate issues as well."

Horton,Methodological Approaches for Measuring the Association Between Heat Exposure and Health Outcomes: A Comprehensive Global Scoping Review,"Objective: To synthesize the methodologies of studies that evaluate the impacts of heat exposure on morbidity and mortality. Methods: Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from date of inception until 1 March 2023 for English language literature on heat exposure and health outcomes. Records were collated, deduplicated and screened, and full texts were reviewed for inclusion and data abstraction. Eligibility for inclusion was determined as any article with climate‐related heat exposure and an associated morbidity/mortality outcome. Results: Of 13,136 records initially identified, 237 articles were selected for analysis. The scope of research represented 43 countries, with most studies conducted in China (62), the USA (44), and Australia (16). Across all studies, there were 141 unique climate data sources, no standard threshold for extreme heat, and 200 unique health outcome data sources. The distributed lag non‐linear model (DLNM) was the most common analytic method (48.1% of studies) and had high usage rates in China (68.9%) and the USA (31.8%); Australia frequently used conditional logistic regression (50%). Conditional logistic regression was most prevalent in case‐control studies (5 of 8 studies, 62.5%) and in case‐crossover studies (29 of 70, 41.4%). DLNMs were most common in time series studies (64 of 111, 57.7%) and ecological studies (13 of 20, 65.0%). Conclusions: This review underscores the heterogeneity of methods in heat impact studies across diverse settings and provides a resource for future researchers.

 One issue that always strands the scaling-up development of perovskite photovoltaics is the significant efficiency drop when enlarging the device area, which is caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of defected sites1-3. In the narrow band gap formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), the native impurities of PbI2 and δ-FAPbI3 non-perovskite could induce unfavored non-radiative recombination, as well as inferior charge transport and extraction 4,5.Here, we develop an impurity-healing interface engineering strategy to well address the issue both in small-area solar cell and large-scale submodule. With the introduction of a functional cation, 2-(1-cyclohexenyl)ethyl ammonium, two-dimensional (2D) perovskite with high mobility is rationally constructed on FAPbI3 to horizontally cover the film surface and vertically penetrate to the grain boundaries of 3D perovskites. Such unique configuration not only comprehensively transforms the PbI2 and δ-FAPbI3 impurities into stable 2D perovskite and realize a uniform defect passivation, but also provides interconnecting channels for efficient carrier transport. As a result, the FAPbI3-based small-area (0.085 cm2) solar cells achieve a champion efficiency over 25.86% with a notably high fill factor (FF) of 86.16%. More encouragingly, the fabricated submodules with the aperture area of 715.1 cm2 obtain a certified record efficiency of 22.46% with a good FF of 81.21%, showcasing the feasibility and effectualness of the impurity-healing interface engineering for scaling-up promotion with well-preserved photovoltaic performance."

 Cognitive deficits are long-lasting consequences of drug use, yet the convergent mechanism by which classes of drugs with different pharmacological properties cause similar deficits is unclear. We find that both phencyclidine and methamphetamine, despite differing in their targets in the brain, cause the same glutamatergic neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of male mice to gain a GABAergic phenotype and decrease expression of their glutamatergic phenotype. Suppressing drug-induced gain of GABA with RNA-interference prevents appearance of memory deficits. Stimulation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area is necessary and sufficient to produce this gain of GABA. Drug-induced prefrontal hyperactivity drives this change in transmitter identity. Returning prefrontal activity to baseline, chemogenetically or with clozapine, reverses the change in transmitter phenotype and rescues the associated memory deficits. This work reveals a shared and reversible mechanism that regulates the appearance of cognitive deficits upon exposure to different drugs.

 Marine heatwaves (MHWs) and total heat exposures (THEs), extreme warming events occurring across the global oceans, seriously threaten marine ecosystems and coastal communities as the climate warms. However, future changes in MHWs and THEs in the Arctic Ocean, where unique marine ecosystems are present, are still unclear. Here, based on the latest CMIP6 climate simulations, we find that both MHWs and THEs in the Arctic Ocean are anticipated to intensify in a warming climate, mainly due to Arctic sea ice decline and long-term warming trend, respectively. Particularly striking is the projected rise in MHW mean intensity during the 21st century in the Arctic Ocean, surpassing the global average by more than sevenfold under the CMIP6 SSP585 scenario. This phenomenon, coined the ‘Arctic MHW Amplification’, underscores an impending and disproportionately elevated threat to the Arctic marine life, necessitating targeted conservation and adaptive strategies.

 The human microbiome emerges as a promising reservoir for diagnostic markers and therapeutics. Since host-associated microbiomes at various body sites differ and diseases do not occur in isolation, a comprehensive analysis strategy highlighting the full potential of microbiomes should include diverse specimen types and various diseases. To ensure robust data quality and comparability across specimen types and diseases, we employ standardized protocols to generate sequencing data from 1931 prospectively collected specimens, including from saliva, plaque, skin, throat, eye, and stool, with an average sequencing depth of 5.3 gigabases. Collected from 515 patients, these samples yield an average of 3.7 metagenomes per patient. Our results suggest significant microbial variations across diseases and specimen types, including unexpected anatomical sites. We identify 583 unexplored species-level genome bins (SGBs) of which 189 are significantly disease-associated. Of note, the existence of microbial resistance genes in one specimen was indicative of the same resistance genes in other specimens of the same patient. Annotated and previously undescribed SGBs collectively harbor 28,315 potential biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), with 1050 significant correlations to diseases.

Here the authors raise nanobodies to human gasdermin and characterize the pore formation process mediated by GSDMD and how antagonistic nanobodies prevent pyroptosis. 
 Inflammasome activation results in the cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) by pro-inflammatory caspases. The N-terminal domains (GSDMDNT) oligomerize and assemble pores penetrating the target membrane. As methods to study pore formation in living cells are insufficient, the order of conformational changes, oligomerization, and membrane insertion remained unclear. We have raised nanobodies (VHHs) against human GSDMD and find that cytosolic expression of VHHGSDMD-1 and VHHGSDMD-2 prevents oligomerization of GSDMDNT and pyroptosis. The nanobody-stabilized GSDMDNT monomers partition into the plasma membrane, suggesting that membrane insertion precedes oligomerization. Inhibition of GSDMD pore formation switches cell death from pyroptosis to apoptosis, likely driven by the enhanced caspase-1 activity required to activate caspase-3. Recombinant antagonistic nanobodies added to the extracellular space prevent pyroptosis and exhibit unexpected therapeutic potential. They may thus be suitable to treat the ever-growing list of diseases caused by activation of (non-) canonical inflammasomes. Inflammasome assembly promotes the cleavage and oligomerisation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and subsequent pore formation. Here the authors raise nanobodies to human gasdermin and characterize the pore formation process mediated by GSDMD and how antagonistic nanobodies prevent pyroptosis."

Here, the authors demonstrate that matching data to a higher-input sample faithfully improves proteome coverage to examine proteome response and heterogeneity in single-cell populations. 
 Proteome analysis by data-independent acquisition (DIA) has become a powerful approach to obtain deep proteome coverage, and has gained recent traction for label-free analysis of single cells. However, optimal experimental design for DIA-based single-cell proteomics has not been fully explored, and performance metrics of subsequent data analysis tools remain to be evaluated. Therefore, we here formalize and comprehensively evaluate a DIA data analysis strategy that exploits the co-analysis of low-input samples with a so-called matching enhancer (ME) of higher input, to increase sensitivity, proteome coverage, and data completeness. We assess the matching specificity of DIA-ME by a two-proteome model, and demonstrate that false discovery and false transfer are maintained at low levels when using DIA-NN software, while preserving quantification accuracy. We apply DIA-ME to investigate the proteome response of U-2 OS cells to interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in single cells, and recapitulate the time-resolved induction of IFN-γ response proteins as observed in bulk material. Moreover, we uncover co- and anti-correlating patterns of protein expression within the same cell, indicating mutually exclusive protein modules and the co-existence of different cell states. Collectively our data show that DIA-ME is a powerful, scalable, and easy-to-implement strategy for single-cell proteomics. Single-cell proteomics needs improved workflows for reliable proteome characterization in minute samples. Here, the authors demonstrate that matching data to a higher-input sample faithfully improves proteome coverage to examine proteome response and heterogeneity in single-cell populations."

 Understanding human, animal, and environmental microbiota is essential for advancing global health and combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We investigate the oral and gut microbiota of 48 animal species in captivity, comparing them to those of wildlife animals. Specifically, we characterize the microbiota composition, metabolic pathways, AMR genes, and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the production of specialized metabolites. Our results reveal a high diversity of microbiota, with 585 novel species-level genome bins (SGBs) and 484 complete BGCs identified. Functional gene analysis of microbiomes shows diet-dependent variations. Furthermore, by comparing our findings to wildlife-derived microbiomes, we observe the impact of captivity on the animal microbiome, including examples of converging microbiome compositions. Importantly, our study identifies AMR genes against commonly used veterinary antibiotics, as well as resistance to vancomycin, a critical antibiotic in human medicine. These findings underscore the importance of the ‘One Health’ approach and the potential for zoonotic transmission of pathogenic bacteria and AMR. Overall, our study contributes to a better understanding of the complexity of the animal microbiome and highlights its BGC diversity relevant to the discovery of novel antimicrobial compounds.

 The approval of splice-switching oligonucleotides with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has advanced the field of oligonucleotide therapy. Despite this progress, PMOs encounter challenges such as poor tissue uptake, particularly in the heart, diaphragm, and central nervous system (CNS), thereby affecting patient’s prognosis and quality of life. To address these limitations, we have developed a PMOs-based heteroduplex oligonucleotide (HDO) technology. This innovation involves a lipid-ligand-conjugated complementary strand hybridized with PMOs, significantly enhancing delivery to key tissues in mdx mice, normalizing motor functions, muscle pathology, and serum creatine kinase by restoring internal deleted dystrophin expression. Additionally, PMOs-based HDOs normalized cardiac and CNS abnormalities without adverse effects. Our technology increases serum albumin binding to PMOs and improves blood retention and cellular uptake. Here we show that PMOs-based HDOs address the limitations in oligonucleotide therapy for DMD and offer a promising approach for diseases amenable to exon-skipping therapy. Here, the authors develop a PMO-based heteroduplex oligonucleotide technology that enhances PMO delivery to tissues and normalizes motor/cardiac function and CNS symptoms in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

 Individuals with mental illness are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, previous studies on the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in this population have reported conflicting results. Using data from seven cohort studies (N = 325,298) included in the multinational COVIDMENT consortium, and the Swedish registers (N = 8,080,234), this study investigates the association between mental illness (defined using self-report measures, clinical diagnosis and prescription data) and COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Results from the COVIDMENT cohort studies were pooled using meta-analyses, the majority of which showed no significant association between mental illness and vaccination uptake. In the Swedish register study population, we observed a very small reduction in the uptake of both the first and second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine among individuals with vs. without mental illness; the reduction was however greater among those not using psychiatric medication. Here we show that uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is generally high among individuals both with and without mental illness, however the lower levels of vaccination uptake observed among subgroups of individuals with unmedicated mental illness warrants further attention. Monitoring COVID-19 vaccine uptake in those at risk of severe disease, such as people with mental illness, is important.

 South America is experiencing severe impacts from climate change. Although the warming of the subcontinent closely follows the global path, the rise of temperatures has been more pronounced in some regions, which have also seen a parallel increment in the occurrence of droughts and weather conditions associated with enhanced fire risk. Here, we use reanalysis datasets to analyze the progression of the concurring warm, dry, and high fire risk conditions (i.e., dry compounds) since 1971. We show that the frequency of these compound extremes has surged in key South American regions including the northern Amazon, which have seen a 3-fold increase in the number of days per year with extreme fire weather conditions (including high temperatures, dryness, and low humidity). Our results also suggest that the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean modulates the interannual variability of dry compounds in South America. While El Niño enhances the fire risk in the northern Amazon, dry extremes in the Gran Chaco region appear to be more responsive to La Niña.

 The rapid increase in Urban Construction Sites (UCSs) due to urbanization has become a global trend. UCSs are crucial for timely tracking of urban expansion and renewal progress, understanding settlement environments and human activities, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 11. However, distinguishing UCSs from other land covers remains challenging, whether using spatial texture and spectral features or time-series characteristics. There is an urgent need for a universally applicable UCS mapping method at the national scale, a gap that current research has yet to fill. In this study, we proposed a method combining geospatial data with remote sensing data for national UCS mapping under medium spatial resolution. Additionally, we combine the UCS mapping results with SDGSAT-1 GLI data to evaluate the utilization status of new construction areas, thereby supporting SDG 11.3. The results showed that, for six representative cities, the F1-Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC) for exposed UCS mapping results ranged from 98.83 % to 99.49 % and from 0.64 to 0.77, respectively. Variable importance detected in the Random Forest (RF) model highlighted that the key to identifying UCSs lay in geospatial information describing UCS spatial distribution, including distance to roads, city boundaries, and dust-proof nets. The assessment of the utilization status for new construction areas highlights the differences in the utilization status with which cities at various stages of development utilize these new areas. We then compared the ability of UCS distribution with existing impervious surface products in reflecting the dynamics of urban construction. The results showed that UCS spatial distribution could reflect urban construction patterns more timely and accurately, providing key insights for urban planners. Overall, this study provides a universal methodology that can be referenced for mapping land covers that have low separability in spectral and textural features in complex urban environments. The proposed method offers a cost-effective and reliable way to map nationwide UCS distribution, providing clear and timely spatial information for urban planning and achieving SDGs."

 In order to facilitate the shift towards sustainable practices and to support the transition to renewable energy, there is a requirement for faster and more accurate predictions of solar irradiance. Surface solar energy predictions are essential for the establishment of solar farms and the enhancement of energy grid management. This paper presents a novel approach to forecast surface solar irradiance up to 24 h in advance, utilizing various machine and deep learning architectures. Our proposed Machine Learning (ML) models include both point-based (1D) and grid-based (3D) solutions, offering a comprehensive exploration of different methodologies. Our forecasts leverage two days of input data to predict the next day of solar exposure at country scale. To assess the models’ performance, extensive testing is conducted across three distinct geographical areas of interest: Austria (where models were trained and validated), Switzerland and Italy (where we tested our models under a transfer learning regime), and sensitivity to the season is also discussed. The study incorporates comparisons with established benchmarks, including state-of-the-art numerical weather predictions, as well as fundamental predictors such as climatology and persistence. Our findings reveal that the ML-based methods clearly outperform traditional forecasting techniques, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability in predicting surface solar irradiance. This research not only contributes to the advancement of solar energy forecasting but also highlights the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models in being competitive to conventional methods for short-term solar irradiance predictions."

 In South Korea, particulate matter (PM) is generated from various emission sources, including domestic air pollutants and long-range transport. Effective air quality policies require an understanding of the chemical characteristics of PM and differences between urban and non-urban areas (suburban and background areas). We analyzed the chemical characteristics of non-refractory submicron aerosols (NR-PM1) in Yongin City, a suburban area southeast of Seoul, using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) in spring/summer. In spring/summer, photochemical reactions resulted in the highest proportion of Organic Aerosol (OA) among NR-PM1. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) revealed four OA sources: Primary OA and Secondary OA (Oxidized Primary OA (OPOA), Less Oxidized Oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), and More Oxidized Oxygenated OA (MO-OOA)). OPOA was formed from the oxidation of emissions from biomass burning and coal combustion; LO-OOA and MO-OOA were correlated with inorganic compounds and influenced by long-range transport. The majority of OA was SOA (82%). High temperatures and humidity accelerated the conversion of SO2 to SO42−, resulting in the proportion of SO42−, second only to OA. Despite favorable conditions for nitrate formation in ammonium-rich conditions, the proportion of NO3− was relatively low due to the decomposition of NH4NO3 into gaseous NH3 and HNO3 at high temperatures. This indicated that while ammonium-rich conditions are conducive to NH4NO3 production, elevated temperatures lead to its decomposition, resulting in lower NO3− concentrations in spring/summer. In the case study, for the case associated with long-range transport, the PM concentration increased due to inorganic compounds such as NO3− and SO42−. Conversely, in cases of domestic air stagnation, the concentration of PM increased primarily due to the presence of OA. These findings provide crucial insights for air quality management in suburban areas and can guide policies to reduce PM levels in spring and summer."

Stone;Christoph Ritter;Simone Pulimeno,Monitoring aerosol optical depth during the Arctic night: Instrument development and first results,"•Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) was continuosly measured at two Arctic sites during the polar night. •The Moon was used as light source for custom-modified conventional solar photometers. •Uncertainty on AOD was evaluated to be similar to the solar case. •This technique has proven to be suitable to measure night-time AOD even in the pristine Arctic. 
 Moon-photometric measurements were made at two locations in the Arctic during winter nights using two different modified Sun photometers; a Carter Scott SP02 and a Precision Filter Radiometer (PFR) developed at PMOD/WRC. Values of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were derived from spectral irradiance measurements made at four wavelengths for each of the devices. The SP02 was located near Barrow, Alaska and recorded data from November 2012 to March 2013, spanning five lunar cycles, while the PFR was deployed to Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard each winter from February 2014 to February 2019 for a total of 56 measurement periods. A methodology was developed to process the raw data, involving calibration of the instruments and normalizing measured spectral irradiance values in accordance with site-specific determinations of the extraterrestrial atmospheric irradiance (ETI) as Moon phase cycled. Uncertainties of the derived AOD values were also evaluated and found to be in the range, 0.006–0.030, depending on wavelength and which device was evaluated.The magnitudes of AOD determined for the two sites were in general agreement with those reported in the literature for sunlit periods just before and after the dark periods of Arctic night. Those for the PFR were also compared with data obtained using star photometers and a Cimel CE318-T, recently deployed to Ny-Ålesund, showing that Moon photometry is viable as a means to monitor AOD during the Arctic night. Such data are valuable for more complete assessments of the role aerosols play in modulating climate, the validation of AOD derived using various remote sensing techniques, and applications related to climate modeling."

We further reveal alternative exon 3 splicing in distantly related bat families and confirm that both cTnI splice variants are incorporated into cardiac myofibrils.

Specifically, the device uses a hierarchically structured solar transpirational evaporator to create a pressure gradient, which allows for the extraction of lithium from brines through a membrane and its storage in a vascular storage layer. Long-term experiments, various membrane tests, and different size assessments demonstrate the stability, compatibility, and scalability of STLES.

We obtained single-cell spatial transcriptomic atlases of macaque, marmoset, and mouse cerebella and identified primate-specific cell subtypes, including Purkinje cells and molecular-layer interneurons, that show different expression of the glutamate ionotropic receptor Delta type subunit 2 (GRID2) gene. Distinct gene expression profiles were found in anterior, posterior, and vestibular regions in all species, whereas region-selective gene expression was predominantly observed in the granular layer of primates and in the Purkinje layer of mice. Gene expression gradients in the cerebellar cortex matched well with functional connectivity gradients revealed with awake functional magnetic resonance imaging, with more lobule-specific differences between primates and mice than between two primate species.

The wood had near-perfect preservation, with carbon loss less than 5% compared to a modern sample. The lack of decay is likely due to the low permeability of the compact clay soil at the burial site. Our observation suggests a hybrid nature-engineering approach for carbon removal by burying woody biomass in similar anoxic environments.

The mathematical model predicted that increased synaptic strength promotes the neuronal “down state” and raises the delta power. Our molecular tool (synapse-targeted chemically induced translocation of Kalirin-7, SYNCit-K), which induces dendritic spine enlargement and synaptic potentiation through chemically induced translocation of protein Kalirin-7, demonstrated that synaptic potentiation of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) increases nonrapid eye movement sleep amounts and delta power.

To address this, we have incorporated machine learning strategies specifically designed for the analysis as they allow for identification of nontrivial dependencies and classification within these high-dimensional data, thereby promising comprehensive interrogation. We introduce a deep learning algorithm trained on a synthetic dataset that allows for fast and accurate analysis of the XRF spectra in MA-XRF datasets.
