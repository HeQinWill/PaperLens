10.1088/1748-9326/add8a2,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注北海风电场的能源生产和风场之间的尾流损失。它使用中尺度气候模型模拟了风电场扩张情景下的能源产量，并分析了风场之间的相互作用对能源生产的影响。虽然该研究涉及大气环境，但其重点在于风能资源评估和风电场优化，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['wind farm energy production', 'inter-farm wake losses', 'mesoscale climate modeling', 'wind resource assessment']",R Borgers;J Meyers;N P M van Lipzig,Energy production and inter-farm wake losses in future North Sea wind farms,"The deployment of new wind farms in the North Sea is an essential part of Europe’s transition to low-emission energy sources. Here, we use the mesoscale climate model COSMO-CLM to simulate the energy production of a realistic 92 GW wind farm expansion scenario and compare it with that of the wind farm distribution in 2024. The simulations indicate that added inter-farm wakes would cause the annual energy production of 25 out of 69 operational wind farms to decline by over 5%, with 13 of them experiencing reductions exceeding 10%. These annual losses are composed of intermittent wake periods characterized by large production deficits. For instance, the planned Princess Elisabeth zone in Belgian waters is expected to reduce the output of the existing Belgian wind farm cluster by more than 15% during one out of every five 24 h periods with high production potential (  ms−1). Despite these enhanced inter-farm interactions, we find that the overall capacity factor over the basin increases by 1.6%pt after expansion due to the deployment of next-generation turbines and installation at low capacity densities in high-resource zones. However, negative impacts are highly region-dependent and many wind farms may face substantial losses. Although more validation studies are recommended to further constrain the uncertainty on the presented results, this work demonstrates the need for a coordinated wind farm expansion strategy, especially because spatial constraints are expected to intensify on the path to surpassing 200 GW of capacity in the North Sea by 2050."

In this letter, we suggest a cross-disciplinary framework for studying the social–ecological margins. We highlight two definitions of marginality, one from the social sciences and one from the natural sciences, and discuss the relations that render a research subject marginal through four case studies on wildlife and agriculture. This discussion illuminates the importance of studying the behavioral and cultural repertoires with which marginal populations respond to social–ecological constraints."

Forest loss due to generally temporary causes, such as wildfire and logging, is important to distinguish from permanent land use conversion due to the differing ecological and climate impacts of these disturbances and for the purposes of developing effective policies and management strategies. Existing global maps of the drivers of forest loss that are widely used are not spatially or thematically detailed enough for decision makers at local-to-regional scales, such as governments, land managers, or companies. Using publicly available satellite observations (Landsat, Sentinel) and ancillary biophysical and population data, we developed a 1 km resolution, global map of the dominant drivers of forest loss from 2001 to 2022 with seven classes: permanent agriculture (e.g. commodity crops or pasture), hard commodities (e.g. mining), shifting cultivation, logging, settlements and infrastructure, wildfire, and other natural disturbances. We interpreted nearly 7000 reference samples to train a global neural network model that classifies the driver of tree cover loss with an overall accuracy of 90.5%. Our results show that permanent agriculture was the leading driver of forest loss globally, representing 35% of loss from 2001 to 2022. The drivers of tree cover loss vary by region, with the leading driver identified as logging in Europe, permanent agriculture across the tropics, and wildfire in Russia, the Asian mainland, North America, and Oceania. Our results enable assessment of forest disturbance dynamics from local to global scales and can support tracking progress towards corporate and governmental zero-deforestation commitments, monitoring deforestation risks within jurisdictions and supply chains, and assessment of global biodiversity targets."

Here, we conduct an initial test of the empirical evidence that such investments were made in the context of groundwater extraction in India. Irrigation with groundwater has played a crucial role in India’s rural development, but also made it the world’s largest consumer of groundwater with fast depleting aquifers. We test whether in locations that have extracted greater amounts of water between 1966–2009, there are indications of greater accumulation of household level physical (assets) and human (education and health) capital, presumably through the investment of income generated from irrigation. We document positive correlations between groundwater utilization and the accumulation of physical assets. The results are more mixed for correlations with health and learning outcomes, which are likely the most important for the diversification of income away from farming once irrigation is no longer viable."

A deployment of marine carbon dioxide removal (CDR) for mitigating global warming could therefore also be viewed as a measure for mitigating ocean deoxygenation if, and only if, the respective CDR measure itself does not lead to a larger oxygen loss than the reduction in atmospheric CO2 would prevent. We here review the current state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of various marine CDR (mCDR) options onto ocean oxygen, a key ocean state variable and an essential element for all higher forms of marine life. Using results from global model simulations, we show that biotic approaches, such as ocean fertilization, macroalgae cultivation and sinking, and placement of organic matter that is prone to remineralization, can lead to a loss in seawater dissolved oxygen that is 4–40 times larger than the oxygen gain that would result from the CDR-induced reduction in global warming only. Biotic approaches also tend to enhance the amplitude of the diel cycle in dissolved oxygen, with possible physiological impacts specifically in shallow-water environments of coastal vegetated ecosystem. In contrast, geochemical approaches, and biotic approaches that avoid remineralization of biomass within the ocean, may be applied in ways that have minimal impacts on dissolved oxygen. We suggest that impacts on marine oxygen should be accounted for in assessing the suitability of mCDR, and that oxygen should be measured prior to, during and after any research-scale or full-scale implementation activity."

However, recent altimetry observations of Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) reveal many eddies own multicore structures. This study investigates the differences between these multicore eddies and single-core eddies and how the multicore eddies are generated. SWOT observation shows that about two-thirds of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies have multiple centers, mainly found in mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and high-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Additionally, the geostrophic velocity in multicore eddies is generally higher, through inverse barotropic energy, than in single-core ones. Using LLC4320 simulations, we found that the baroclinic (BC) instability plays a key role in forming these subcenters, and the probability of eddies generating multiple centers decreases during the eddy lifecycle. There are more multicore eddies observed in winter, corresponding to a larger BC growth rate, than in summer. Our study provides new insights into the structure of eddies."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade0d7,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注水文预报，特别是欧洲地区次季节到季节（S2S）的径流预测。它探讨了如何结合欧洲中期天气预报中心（ECMWF）的次季节（ENS-ER）和季节（SEAS5）系统，以提高不同水文区域的预测技能。论文侧重于优化预测技能的无缝通信方法，并根据区域特点定制策略，为水资源和气候相关部门提供准确的信息。虽然该研究涉及气候预测，但它主要集中在水文过程和径流预测方面，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,[],Ilias G Pechlivanidis;Louise Crochemore,Skill-informed seamless communication of European S2S hydrological forecasts,"Sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) information holds significant socio-economic value for decision-makers relying on climate variability. While significant advancements have been made in S2S meteorological forecasting, skill variability among prediction systems persists due to differences in physical process representation and technical characteristics of the predictive systems. Traditionally, sub-seasonal systems are considered more informative than seasonal systems within their time horizons, leading to seamless communication approaches that combine systems at fixed horizons, overlooking tailored solutions to optimize forecast skill. This study investigates S2S streamflow forecasting skill across Europe’s diverse hydrological regimes, identifying optimal combination horizons for skill-informed seamless communication. Using bias-adjusted forecasts from ECMWF’s sub-seasonal (ENS-ER) and seasonal (SEAS5) systems, we evaluate streamflow forecasts to uncover spatiotemporal complementarities between the two systems. The results reveal that most European basins benefit from sub-seasonal forecasts up to 3–6 weeks ahead, while steep, snow-dominated mountain ranges, high-precipitation basins, and elevated Mediterranean areas exhibit shorter horizons of 2–4 weeks. Gains in meteorological forecast skill at short lead times (1–3 weeks) are amplified when translated into hydrological processes, extending predictability up to 6 weeks. ENS-ER-based forecasts demonstrate greater spatial homogeneity in skill during shorter lead times, while SEAS5-based forecasts excel at extended horizons. These findings highlight the potential for tailored seamless products to enhance S2S forecast utility. By integrating complementary S2S prediction systems with this diagnostic, region-dependent strategy tailored to diverse hydrological regimes, hydro-climate services can seamlessly deliver accurate, actionable, and operationally relevant information to water- and climate-dependent sectors."

This study integrates ozone lidar observations, WRF-Chem modeling, and meteorological analyses to investigate the monthly and diurnal variations of ozone vertical profiles and its generation and transport mechanisms during a heatwave from July to September 2022 in Guangzhou. Results show that ozone concentrations were primarily confined below 2 km, with significantly higher levels in July compared to August and September, reaching a maximum of 420 μg m−3. WRF-Chem modeling identified photochemical reactions as the dominant driver of ozone formation, with average contributions of 5.9 ppb hr−1, 6.3 ppb hr−1, and 3.7 ppb hr−1 in July, August, and September, respectively. Vertical mixing and convective processes had minimal influence, while advective accumulation became increasingly significant with altitude. Meteorological analyses further indicated that the high temperature and low humidity caused by the subtropical high pressure system further intensified photochemical reactions and promoted ozone production. In addition, the south-westerly winds at the periphery of anticyclone drove ozone transport to downstream areas such as Fujian. This study advances our understanding of ozone vertical profiles and transport dynamics, providing critical insights for developing effective ozone pollution control strategies in the Pearl River Delta region."

To address this, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of two distinct soil-regulated water limitation regimes in global drylands, distinguishing between ecosystem water limitation regulated by wilting point (WP) and those regulated by critical soil moisture (CSM) threshold for meeting ecosystem water demand. We find systematic differences of these two distinct water limitation regimes across drylands: the more significant the WP effect, the less significant the CSM effect, and vice versa. Climatic aridity, soil texture, root-water uptake depths or all together drive the divergence between two types of ecosystem water limitations at regional scale, and soil texture play a dominant role. Sand and clay soils drive ecosystem productivity fluctuations by increased water limitations, albeit through different pathways: clay soils correspond to a more significant water limitation as WP contribution rather than CSM, while sandy soils are the opposite. In this study, the framework of decoupling the differential effects of soil on ecosystem water limitation was re-developed by integrating WP and CSM into ecological drought monitoring and assessment."

In China, the grasslands of dryland Inner Mongolia provide a vital ecological resource, highlight the urgent need to understand their response to drought in these arid regions. We investigate vegetation dynamics and soil moisture fluctuations across three grassland types—meadows, typical grasslands, and desert grasslands—utilizing solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil moisture data from 2001 to 2020. By employing event coincidence analysis and the maximum coincidence rate, we quantified the grasslands’ responses to drought events. Our findings indicate a significant upward trend in SIF across all grassland types over the past two decades, while NDVI and soil moisture levels remained relatively stable. Under drought conditions, the probability of grassland degradation ranged from 40% to 60%. Notably, desert grasslands exhibited a considerably slower response rate compared to other grassland types, while meadow grasslands responded the fastest to drought; however, all grassland types displayed a response delay of 1–2 months. When soil moisture levels fell below −1.8 standard deviations (STDs), a reversal in grassland response patterns was observed, particularly in meadow grasslands, which showed a substantial increase in response probability. At soil moisture levels below −2.4 STD, this probability stabilized at approximately 90%, significantly higher than that of other grassland types. These insights provide a vital basis for understanding and mitigating drought impacts on resilient grassland ecosystems under climate change."

However, long-term impacts of SF on vegetation and the underlying mechanism remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct spatial (Impact versus Control zones) and temporal (pre- versus post- development of utility-scale SF) comparisons of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate vegetation variations in three ground-mounted utility-scale SF (with an average installed capacity of 8263 MW) in northwest China. Results indicate SF impacts on vegetation within an extent of around 1 km. Both spatial and temporal comparisons reveal positive SF impacts on vegetation, with higher NDVI in Impact (0.098) than Control zones (0.076) as well as during post- (0.113) than pre-SF development (0.087). Further quantification based on random forest shows generally equivalent contribution of climatic factors and SF construction on vegetation greening (48.4% and 51.6% respectively). These findings underscore substantial influence of SF on vegetation in non-humid conditions, and raise an urgent need to further explore its potential eco-environmental implications on a broader scale."

We use the WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modeling system to innovatively reconstruct the meteorologically-driven trends of PM2.5 pollution in Beijing from 2013 to 2023 by setting up fixed emission scenarios and minimize the interference of anthropogenic emissions. The results show that the heavy pollution frequency (HPF) in Beijing in winter is significantly correlated with the intensity of ENSO (r = 0.72, p < 0.05): the intensity of El Niño events is positively correlated with the HPF, and the intensity of La Niña events is negatively correlated with the HPF. Further analysis reveals that ENSO triggers anomalous 850 hPa southerly winds and 500 hPa northwesterly winds mainly through coupling with the East Asian Winter Monsoon, thus altering the low-level warm and humid transport and mid-level diffusion conditions. In addition, the ENSO-driven trans-regional transport also led to the formation of distinct spatial distribution patterns of pollution between Beijing and Tianjin–Tangshan areas."

The emissions computed are shown to be larger than known oil and gas sources, indicating that methane from coal mines may play a larger role in the global methane budget. The results are found to be slightly larger than or similar to satellite observational campaigns over the same region. 
 This work focuses on Changzhi, Shanxi, China, a city and surrounding rural region with one of the highest atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH4) worldwide (campaign-wide minimum, mean, standard deviation, and max observations: 2.0, 2.9, 1.3, and 16 ppm) due to a rapid increase in the mining, production, and use of coal over the past decade. An intensive 15 d surface observation campaign of CH4 concentration is used to drive a new analytical, mass-conserving method to compute and attribute CH4 emissions. Observations made in concentric circles at 1, 3, and 5 km around a high-production high gas coal mine yielded emissions of 0.73, 0.28, and 0.15 ppm min−1, respectively. For attribution a two-box mass-conserving model was used to identify the known mine's emissions from 0.042–5.3 ppm min−1 and a previously unidentified mine's emission from 0.22–7.9 ppm min−1. These results demonstrate the importance of simultaneously quantifying both the spatial and temporal distribution of CH4 emissions to better control regional-scale CH4 emissions. Results of the attribution are used in tandem with observations of boundary layer height to quantify policy-relevant emissions from the two coal mines as 6860 ± 3520 and 1010 ± 347 kg h−1, respectively. Both mines display a fat-tailed distribution, with respective 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile values of [1600, 3070, 10 500]  and [755, 1090, 1420] kg h−1. These findings are demonstrated to be higher than CH4 emissions from equivalent oil and gas operations in the USA, with one about double and the other similar to day-to-day emissions inverted over 5 years using TROPOMI over the same region."

This study uses in situ data collected aboard passenger aircraft to assess the ability of four chemistry–climate models to reproduce (bi-)decadal climatologies of ozone, carbon monoxide, water vapour, and reactive nitrogen in this region. The models reproduce the very distinct ozone seasonality in the upper troposphere and in the lower stratosphere well. 
 Assessing global models in the upper troposphere (UT) and in the lowermost stratosphere (LS) is an important step toward a better understanding of the chemical composition near the tropopause. For this purpose, the current study focuses on an evaluation of long-term simulations from four chemistry–climate/transport models, based on In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) measurements. Most simulations span the period from 1995 to 2017 and follow a common protocol among models. The assessment focuses on climatological averages of ozone (O3), water vapour (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and reactive nitrogen (NOy). In the extra-tropics, the models reproduce the seasonality of O3, H2O, and NOy in both the UT and LS, but none of them reproduce the CO springtime maximum in the UT. Tropospheric tracers (CO and H2O) tend to be underestimated in the UT, consistently with an overestimation of cross-tropopause exchanges. Most models systematically overestimate ozone in the UT, and the background of nitrogen oxides (NOx) appears to be the main contributor to ozone variability across the models. The partitioning between NOy species changes drastically across the models and acts as a source of uncertainty in the NOx mixing ratio and on the impact of these species on atmospheric composition. However, we highlight some well-reproduced geographical variations, such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) seasonal shifts above Africa and the correlation of extratropical ozone (H2O) in the LS (UT) with the observations. These features are encouraging with respect to the simulated dynamics in both layers. The current study confirms the importance of separating the UT and the LS with a dynamical tracer for the evaluation of model results and for model intercomparisons."

The model underestimates temperature, leading to an overprediction of contrail formation and larger ice-supersaturated regions. Adjusting the model improves temperature accuracy but adds uncertainties. Better predictions of contrail formation areas can help optimise flight tracks to reduce aviation's climate effect. 
 While carbon dioxide emissions from aviation often dominate climate change discussions, non-CO2 effects such as contrails and contrail cirrus must also be considered. Despite varying estimates of their radiative forcing, avoiding contrails is a reasonable strategy for reducing aviation’s climate effects. This study examines temperature and humidity, key atmospheric parameters for contrail formation, across different ECHAM/MESSy (European Centre Hamburg General Circulation Model/Modular Earth Submodel System) Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model setups. EMAC, a general circulation model, is evaluated with various vertical resolutions and two nudging methods across seven specified dynamics setups. A higher vertical resolution aims to capture steep water vapour gradients near the tropopause, crucial for accurate contrail prediction. Comparisons with reanalysis data (March–April 2014) indicate a systematic cold bias (approximately 3–5 K in mid-latitudes), particularly in setups without mean temperature nudging. In the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, all simulations exhibit a wet bias, while lower altitudes display a dry bias, both affecting contrail formation estimates. Point-by-point comparisons along aircraft trajectories confirm similar biases. Sensitivity experiments with varying thresholds of relative humidity over ice illustrate trade-offs between achieving high hit rates and minimising false alarms in contrail detection. A single-day case study integrating aircraft and satellite observations demonstrates that EMAC’s predicted contrail coverage aligns well with the observed formation. These results suggest that, despite existing temperature and humidity biases, EMAC generally captures regions favourable for contrail formation across diverse atmospheric conditions. Addressing model biases by refining temperature and humidity representation could significantly improve contrail prediction accuracy, strengthening contrail-avoidance strategies and supporting climate-optimised flight routing to mitigate aviation's overall climate effect."

The fitting parameters obtained within a narrow range of conditions can generally be extended to estimate the OHexp for wide ranges of conditions in the OFR, except for external OH reactivity, which requires new fitting. At least 20–30 data points from SO2 or CO decay with varying conditions are required to fit a set of empirical parameters that can accurately estimate OHexp. 
 The oxidation flow reactor (OFR) has been widely used to simulate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in laboratory and field studies. OH exposure (OHexp), representing the extent of hydroxyl (OH) radical oxidation and normally expressed as the product of OH concentration and residence time in the OFR, is important in assessing the oxidation chemistry in SOA formation. Several models have been developed to quantify the OHexp in OFRs, and empirical equations have been proposed to parameterize OHexp. Practically, the empirical equations and the associated parameters are derived under atmospheric relevant conditions (i.e., external OH reactivity) with limited variations in calibration conditions, such as residence time, water vapor mixing ratio, and ozone (O3) concentration. Whether the equations or parameters derived under limited sets of calibration conditions can accurately predict the OHexp under dynamically changing experimental conditions with large variations (i.e., extremely high external OH reactivity) in real applications remains uncertain. In this study, we conducted 62 sets of experiments (416 data points) under a wide range of experimental conditions to evaluate the scope of the application of the empirical equations to estimate OHexp. Sensitivity tests were also conducted to obtain a minimum number of data points, which is necessary for generating the fitting parameters. We showed that, for the OFR185 mode (185 nm lamps with internal O3 generation), except for external OH reactivity, the parameters obtained within a narrow range of calibration conditions can be extended to estimate the OHexp when the experiments are in wider ranges of conditions. For example, parameters derived within a narrow water vapor mixing ratio range (0.49 %–0.99 %, corresponding to 15.1 %–30.8 % of relative humidity at 101.325 kPa and 298 K) can be extended to estimate the OHexp under the entire range of water vapor mixing ratios (0.49 %–2.76 %, equivalent to 15.1 %–85.7 % of relative humidity under identical conditions). However, the parameters obtained when the external OH reactivity is below 23 s−1 could not be used to reproduce the OHexp under the entire range of external OH reactivity (4–204 s−1). For the OFR254 mode (254 nm lamps with external O3 generation), all parameters obtained within a narrow range of conditions can be used to estimate OHexp accurately when experimental conditions are extended. Additionally, when using the OFR254 mode, lamp voltages that are too low should be avoided, as they will generally result in large deviations in the estimations of OHexp from empirical equations. Regardless of whether the OFR185 or OFR254 mode is used, at least 20–30 data points from sulfur dioxide (SO2) or carbon monoxide (CO) decay with varying conditions are required to fit a set of empirical parameters that can accurately estimate OHexp. Caution should be exercised to use fitted parameters from low external OH reactivity to high ones, for instance, those from direct emissions such as vehicular exhaust and biomass burning."

We estimated an average annual CH4 emission of 22.8 ± 2.4 Tg CH4 yr−1 (15.7–51.6 Tg CH4 yr−1). Emissions were intensified in 2016, 2020, and 2022, with the largest interannual variation coming from Western Siberia. Continued, all-season tower observations and improved soil moisture products are needed for future improvement of CH4 upscaling. 
 Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane (CH4) emissions globally. Northern wetlands (>45° N), accounting for 42 % of global wetland area, are increasingly vulnerable to carbon loss, especially as CH4 emissions may accelerate under intensified high-latitude warming. However, the magnitude and spatial patterns of high-latitude CH4 emissions remain relatively uncertain. Here, we present estimates of daily CH4 fluxes obtained using a new machine learning-based wetland CH4 upscaling framework (WetCH4) that combines the most complete database of eddy-covariance (EC) observations available to date with satellite remote-sensing-informed observations of environmental conditions at 10 km resolution. The most important predictor variables included near-surface soil temperatures (top 40 cm), vegetation spectral reflectance, and soil moisture. Our results, modeled from 138 site years across 26 sites, had relatively strong predictive skill, with a mean R2 of 0.51 and 0.70 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 30 and 27 nmol m−2 s−1 for daily and monthly fluxes, respectively. Based on the model results, we estimated an annual average of 22.8±2.4 Tg CH4 yr−1 for the northern wetland region (2016–2022), and total budgets ranged from 15.7 to 51.6 Tg CH4 yr−1, depending on wetland map extents. Although 88 % of the estimated CH4 budget occurred during the May–October period, a considerable amount (2.6±0.3 Tg CH4) occurred during winter. Regionally, the Western Siberian wetlands accounted for a majority (51 %) of the interannual variation in domain CH4 emissions. Overall, our results provide valuable new high-spatiotemporal-resolution information on the wetland emissions in the high-latitude carbon cycle. However, many key uncertainties remain, including those driven by wetland extent maps and soil moisture products and the incomplete spatial and temporal representativeness in the existing CH4 flux database; e.g., only 23 % of the sites operate outside of summer months, and flux towers do not exist or are greatly limited in many wetland regions. These uncertainties will need to be addressed by the science community to remove the bottlenecks currently limiting progress in CH4 detection and monitoring.

To address this gap, we develop a global 1 km spatially continuous UCP dataset (GloUCP) which provides superior spatial coverage and higher accuracy in capturing urban morphology across diverse regions. It has great potential to support further advancements in urban climate modeling and related applications. 
 The complexities of urban climate and environmental challenges have garnered significant attention in the 21st century. Numerical simulations, offering high-spatiotemporal-resolution meteorological data, are essential tools in meteorological research and atmospheric science. Accurate representation of urban morphology parameters is crucial for enhancing the precision of these simulations in urban areas. Despite the availability of urban canopy parameter (UCP) data for 44 major cities in the United States and 60 in China for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a comprehensive global dataset representing urban morphology remains absent. This study addresses this gap by leveraging existing global three-dimensional vector data of buildings, including footprints and heights, to compile a global 1 km spatially continuous UCP (GloUCP) dataset for the WRF model. Our findings indicate that GloUCP not only surpasses existing datasets in accuracy but also provides superior spatial coverage. In key urban agglomerations such as Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, GloUCP offers detailed and reliable urban morphological information that closely aligns with reference datasets, outperforming other available sources. Similarly, in United States cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, GloUCP consistently achieves lower RMSE values and higher correlation coefficients, demonstrating its robustness in modeling diverse urban environments. Furthermore, GloUCP's capability to effectively capture the vertical distribution of buildings, particularly in high-rise areas, highlights its utility in urban climate modeling and related applications. As UCPs are pivotal in regulating atmospheric responses to urbanization, the availability of this globally consistent urban description is a crucial prerequisite for advancing model development and informing climate-sensitive urban planning policies.

Heat transfer peaks in spring, while water vapor release is highest in summer. Most stations act as carbon sinks, but one in a forested valley is a carbon source, likely due to vegetation loss and human activity. The findings highlight the strong connections between water, heat, and carbon fluxes, offering valuable insights into climate change and weather forecasting. 
 Land-atmosphere (LA) interaction process, through the turbulent exchange of water, heat and CO2 flux, significantly influences regional micro-climates, local water cycles, energy budgets, and ecosystem dynamics. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), characterized by vast extent, high elevation, strong solar radiation and convection, as well as extreme weather fluctuations, has been under-explored due to the scarcity of LA interaction stations, particularly in the western and northern regions. To address this gap, this study introduces a newly constructed research and observation platform, which consists of 16 planetary boundary layer towers, spans diverse landscapes and covers dynamic meteorological conditions, with average annual air temperature, wind speed and liquid precipitation ranging from -3.5 to 18.5 °C, 0.6 to 5.6 m s-1, and 43 mm to 2164 mm. Elevation correlates significantly with all meteorological variables, highlighting a strong spatial heterogeneity distribution patterns of LA coupling. The turbulent flux of water and heat show clear seasonal variations, with highest sensible heat flux (SH) in April–May and largest latent heat flux (LE) in July–August. Further, most stations report negative net ecosystem exchange (NEE) values, ranging from -3.2 g C m-2 a-1 at Mangai to -174.3 g C m-2 a-1 at NADORS, and function as carbon sinks. However, Medog station, locating in the densely forested Yarlung Zangbo valley, functions as a carbon source which is most probably related to the vegetation destruction and human activities. LE is significantly and closely correlated with SH, NEE and ecosystem respiration, indicating strong coupling between water, heat and carbon fluxes. Precipitation as well as soil water content provide favorable moisture sources and show significance in the water-carbon coupling process. The observation and research platform and the quality-controlled high-temporal resolution data provide valuable in situ measurements for studying water-heat-carbon interactions, validating numerical models and satellite algorithms, and offering ground truth for research on hydrological, meteorological, and ecological responses to global climate change."

Craig;Bryan A. Tolson,A reach-integrated hydraulic modelling approach  for large-scale and real-time inundation mapping,"We aim to improve mapping of floods and present a new method for hydraulic modelling that uses a combination of novel geospatial analysis and existing hydraulic modelling approaches. This method is wrapped into a modelling software called Blackbird. We compared Blackbird with two other existing options for flood mapping and found that the Blackbird model outperformed both. The Blackbird model has the potential to support real-time and large-scale flood mapping applications in the future. 
 Flooding is one of the world's most common and costly natural hazards, inflicting billions in damages each year. However, current hydraulic models to support flood mapping are not well suited for large-scale applications or frequent updates, either due to limited accuracy of simple methods or lack of scalability (i.e. large computational requirements) for more sophisticated hydrodynamic models. This results in flood maps being decades out of date or simply nonexistent in some areas. Recent advances in generating flood maps have been made seemingly in parallel between geospatial methods and hydrodynamic models, such as the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) method, hybrid 1D–2D hydrodynamic models, and more efficient computing of 2D models. This study presents the Geospatially Augmented Standard Step (GASS) method, which combines a novel improvement to the HAND method, Dynamic Height Above Nearest Drainage (DHAND), with a 1D hydraulic model for rapid flood inundation mapping at large scales while maintaining the accuracy of hydrodynamic models. This method is implemented into a new modelling software package called Blackbird and is tested via verification of the code and a benchmark case study comparing multiple approaches in the ability to approximate 2D model results. The Blackbird model vastly outperforms the simpler HAND–Manning method and also outperforms a traditional HEC-RAS 1D model when evaluated for accuracy of approximating a 2D model benchmark. This new method is shown to reduce the incidence of falsely predicting flooded areas through improved resolution of landscape connections over HAND-based or 1D hydraulic models. Blackbird also streamlines the model development effort relative to existing 1D or 2D models while maintaining a computational speed that was 10 000 times faster (a few seconds compared to a few hours) than a comparable 2D model in one case study. The method also allows for future integration of hydraulic structures, ice jams, and other features that are unavailable in HAND-based models. Overall, the GASS method provides a viable option for large-scale and real-time fluvial flood mapping applications."

However, this study reveals a critical limitation: in atmospheric environments where reactant density is relatively low, the generation of OH radicals triggers the breakdown of the C–C network in carbon cocatalysts rather than degrading air pollutants. This self-destruction of carbon cocatalysts not only reduced long-term efficiency but also led to their mineralization into CO2, causing unintended secondary air pollution. We verified the self-destruction mechanism of carbon nanotubes, graphene oxides, and carbon nanofibers loaded onto TiO2 through microscopic and colorimetric analyses in air purification applications. Although these composites initially exhibited higher removal efficiencies for various gaseous pollutants, their performances over an extended period reverted to that of pristine TiO2, while contributing to additional CO2 emission. An economic analysis comparing carbon cocatalysts with noble metals, factoring in material costs, accumulated depreciation, and CO2 emission taxes, revealed that carbon cocatalysts are less economically favorable than noble metal cocatalysts, especially when they are used in practice over the long term. Contrary to perception, using carbon cocatalysts in photocatalytic air purification may offset their benefits, indicating the need for a paradigm shift from focusing on initial cost and removal efficiency to considering the ultimate environmental relevance."

Large uncertainties exist in the estimation of VOC emission intensities. Measurement- and calculation-based estimation methods have  limitations in representativeness and applicability, respectively. The inversion method based on downwind receptor monitoring was considered a more effective approach. In this research, a novel inverse dispersion method based on multiple fingerprint species for estimating the intensities of VOCs emissions from the chemical industry was developed. A coating production plant was selected as a case study for validation of this method, and the AERMOD model was utilized to establish the correlation coefficient matrix between the emission intensities of the source items and the concentrations at downwind receptor points. By leveraging the correlation coefficients for multiple fingerprint species and the source chemical profiles, the novel method exhibits good performance in the estimation accuracy. The overall source intensity of the target plant was estimated to be 91.3 mg/s with an overall uncertainty range of ±6.05% and equivalent contributions from aromatics, oxygenated, and halogenated VOCs, which are consistent with the measured intensity (82.6 mg/s) and chemical composition. The uncertainty ranges for the fingerprint species with an emission contribution of no less than 10% have been reduced to ±19.2%–71.7%. This new approach, reflecting the quasi-real-time emission intensities, is useful to pollution tracing in complex sources (e.g., chemical industrial parks) and nonpoint sources (e.g., biomass burning)."

This study evaluated the potential of using heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) filters to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in university lecture rooms. HVAC filters were collected from three air handling units (AHUs) in university buildings between November 2022 and February 2024. Using vacuum-based dust collection, followed by RT-ddPCR analysis, varying levels of SARS-CoV-2 were detected on filters across AHUs. Positive detection rates ranged from 28 to 86% in prefilters and 17–50% in final filters. Viral concentrations in coarse dust varied significantly across AHUs and sampling batches, reaching up to 14,000 genome copies (gc)/g of dust in prefilters. Analysis of fine dust samples showed  viral concentrations higher than those of coarse dust when normalized by dust mass. Factors such as the prevalence of COVID-19  on campus, occupancy dynamics, lecture room air distribution systems, and HVAC operation conditions likely contributed to the observed SARS-CoV-2 positive rates and concentrations in dust samples.

This AMOC tipping event was found under constant pre‐industrial greenhouse gas forcing, while global warming likely limits this AMOC‐induced cooling response. Here, we quantify the European temperature responses under different AMOC regimes and climate change scenarios. A strongly reduced AMOC state and intermediate global warming (≤+2° ${\le} +2{}^{\circ}$C, Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) has a profound cooling effect on Northwestern Europe with more intense cold extremes. The largest temperature responses are found during the winter months and these responses are strongly influenced by the North Atlantic sea‐ice extent. Enhanced North Atlantic storm track activity under an AMOC collapse results in substantially larger day‐to‐day temperature fluctuations.

This issue has been widely discussed but without a clear attribution. Using the latest sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models, we investigate the relevant physical processes contributing to the greater simulated temperature variability in China based on the atmospheric energy budget. The results show that a strong overestimation exists in Northwest, Southwest, North, Central, and East China, which is dominated by the poor reproduction of snow cover and cloud. Exaggerated snow cover variability enhances the fluctuations of the clear‐sky shortwave radiation reflected back to the top‐of‐the‐atmosphere, inducing positive biases in the Tibetan Plateau, North, Central, and East China. This snow‐albedo feedback also explains why the overvalued temperature variability in winter and spring is larger than that in summer and autumn. The shortwave cloud radiative forcing is also responsible for the overvalued temperature fluctuations in North and Northwest China, as well as south of 30°N in Central and East China. The contributions of snow‐albedo feedback and shortwave cloud radiative forcing vary with seasons and regions. Additionally, the overvalued tropospheric temperature variability leads to the temperature variability overestimation in Northwest China."

However, the contributions of large‐scale atmospheric processes and land‐atmosphere interactions to heatwave dynamics and their cascading impacts on water resources and human exposure are not fully understood. This study investigates heatwave frequency (HWF) across 50 global regions, spanning historical (1979–2014) and future periods (2025–2060 and 2065–2100) under SSP 370 (regional rivalry) and SSP 585 (fossil‐fuel development) scenarios. Using bias‐corrected general circulation model simulations and reconstructed terrestrial water storage (TWS) data, we quantify the contributions of atmospheric processes to HWF modulation and assess the impacts of HWF and temperature changes on water storage deficits using TWS drought severity index (TWS‐DSI) and standardized temperature index (STI). We show that Western Central Asia exhibits moisture divergence driven by significant positive thermodynamic effects, which correlates with increased HWF. In West Africa, moisture flux divergence at 1,000 hPa accounts for 45% of HWF variability, while relative humidity at 300 hPa explains 58% of HWF changes in East Asia. HWF and STI strongly influence TWS‐DSI, with high STI intensifying TWS deficits. Concurrent high HWF and wet conditions in Western North America are linked to atmospheric blocking and hydrological persistence, highlighting complex illative mechanisms. We project population exposure to HWF to rise tenfold globally by 2100, with regions such as South Asia experiencing over 100% increases due to combined climate and population effects.

 Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to restore communication for people who have lost the ability to speak owing to a neurological disease or injury. BCIs have been used to translate the neural correlates of attempted speech into text1–3. However, text communication fails to capture the nuances of human speech, such as prosody and immediately hearing one’s own voice. Here we demonstrate a brain-to-voice neuroprosthesis that instantaneously synthesizes voice with closed-loop audio feedback by decoding neural activity from 256 microelectrodes implanted into the ventral precentral gyrus of a man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe dysarthria. We overcame the challenge of lacking ground-truth speech for training the neural decoder and were able to accurately synthesize his voice. Along with phonemic content, we were also able to decode paralinguistic features from intracortical activity, enabling the participant to modulate his BCI-synthesized voice in real time to change intonation and sing short melodies.

 Type I interferons are essential for antiviral immunity1 but must be tightly regulated2. The conserved transcriptional repressor SP140 inhibits interferon-β (Ifnb1) expression through an unknown mechanism3,4. Here we report that SP140 does not directly repress Ifnb1 transcription. Instead, SP140 negatively regulates Ifnb1 mRNA stability by directly repressing the expression of a previously uncharacterized regulator that we call RESIST (regulated stimulator of interferon via stabilization of transcript; previously annotated as annexin 2 receptor). RESIST promotes Ifnb1 mRNA stability by counteracting Ifnb1 mRNA destabilization mediated by the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins and the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex. SP140 localizes within punctate structures called nuclear bodies that have important roles in silencing DNA-virus gene expression in the nucleus3. Consistent with this observation, we find that SP140 inhibits replication of the gammaherpesvirus MHV68. The antiviral activity of SP140 is independent of its ability to regulate Ifnb1. Our results establish dual antiviral and interferon regulatory functions for SP140. We propose that SP140 and RESIST participate in antiviral effector-triggered immunity5,6.

This enabled circuit operation below 3 V with an operating frequency of up to 25 kHz, which was constrained by parasitic capacitances, along with ultra-low power consumption in the picowatt range and a switching energy as low as approximately 100 pJ.

 Since the invention of the laser, nonlinear effects such as filamentation1, Rabi cycling2,3 and collective emission4 have been explored in the optical regime, leading to a wide range of scientific and industrial applications5–8. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have extended many optical techniques to X-rays for their advantages of ångström-scale spatial resolution and elemental specificity9. An example is XFEL-driven inner-shell Kα1 (2p3/2 → 1s1/2) X-ray lasing in elements ranging from neon to copper, which has been used for nonlinear spectroscopy and development of new X-ray laser sources10–16. Here we show that strong lasing effects similar to those in the optical regime can occur at 1.5–2.1 Å wavelengths during high-intensity (>1019 W cm−2) XFEL-driven Kα1 lasing of copper and manganese. Depending on the temporal XFEL pump pulse substructure, the resulting X-ray pulses (about 106−108 photons) can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneities and spectral splitting, inhomogeneities and broadening. Three-dimensional Maxwell–Bloch calculations17 show that the observed spatial inhomogeneities result from X-ray filamentation and that the broad spectral features are driven by sub-femtosecond Rabi cycling. Our simulations indicate that these X-ray pulses can have pulse lengths of less than 100 attoseconds and coherence properties that provide opportunities for quantum X-ray optics applications. Strong lasing effects similar to those in the optical regime can occur at 1.5–2.1 Å wavelengths during high-intensity XFEL-driven Kα1 lasing of copper and manganese."

Here, the authors develop an integrated analysis of advanced SGC to characterize the immune microenvironment and identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. 
 Salivary gland cancers are rare, diverse malignancies characterized by poor response to immunotherapy. The tumor immune environment in these cancers remains poorly understood. To address this, we perform an integrative analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment in a large cohort of advanced salivary gland cancer samples. Most tumors exhibit low immune activity with limited immune cell infiltration. Inflammation is linked to higher tumor mutational burden in non-adenoid cystic carcinoma histologies. Subtype specific expression of immune checkpoints is identified with prominent expression of VTCN1 in luminal-like cells within adenoid cystic carcinoma. Macrophages with immunosuppressive properties dominate the immune microenvironment across subtypes. Responses to immunotherapy are limited and associated with a higher ratio of T-cells relative to macrophages in individual cases, warranting further investigation. Here, we show an immunosuppressive environment in salivary gland cancers and identify subtype-specific immune vulnerabilities that could inform tailored therapeutic strategies.

 Importing renewable energy to Europe may offer many potential benefits, including reduced energy costs, lower pressure on infrastructure development, and less land use within Europe. However, open questions remain: on the achievable cost reductions, how much should be imported, whether the energy vector should be electricity, hydrogen, or derivatives like ammonia or steel, and their impact on Europe’s infrastructure needs. This study integrates a global energy supply chain model with a European energy system model to explore net-zero emission scenarios with varying import volumes, costs, and vectors. We find system cost reductions of 1-10%, within import cost variations of  ± 20%, with diminishing returns for larger import volumes and a preference for methanol, steel and hydrogen imports. Keeping some domestic power-to-X production is beneficial for integrating variable renewables, leveraging local carbon sources and power-to-X waste heat.

This study examines the impact of human depopulation on biodiversity levels across Japan. 
 Global studies consistently highlight a direct relationship between habitat and species losses, and human population and economic growth. Nevertheless, countries are experiencing below-replacement human fertility and starting to depopulate; among these countries, Japan is a global forerunner. To better understand whether human depopulation automatically yields environmentally restorative outcomes, we examine the impacts of human depopulation on aspects of biodiversity in Japan. Alongside population, land use and surface temperature, we analyse biodiversity change among 464 taxonomic species of bird, butterfly, firefly and frog egg masses, and 2,922 native and non-native plant species in wooded, agricultural and peri-urban landscapes across Japan over periods of 5–17 years from 2004. Irrespective of human population increase or decrease, biodiversity losses continue among most species studied mainly because of change in agricultural land use, either due to urbanization, disuse and abandonment, or intensification. Only where human numbers are currently stable, biodiversity is also more stable, although we anticipate that this may also change as ageing deepens into depopulation in these areas. We conclude by urging countries facing depopulation to account for its outcomes in their biodiversity conservation and restoration strategies.

 Determining what was responsible for the last glacial millennial-scale glacier fluctuations can help to pinpoint the causes of abrupt climate events during that period. Yet, the question remains poorly constrained in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), where glaciers react to the global climate system via the northern mid-latitude westerlies and Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM). Here, we examine this issue through 10Be exposure dating of moraines in the western Nyainqentanglha Mountains, southern TP. We find that glaciers reached their maximum extent during the last glaciation before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and that the LGM termination pre-dated a rapid CO2 rise at ~18 ka. Changes in summer air temperature, which is tied to the northern tropical Indian Ocean sea surface temperature by the northern mid-latitude westerlies, likely accounted for the pattern of glacial fluctuations, along with the ASM weakening. The rising summer solar insolation from 23 ka also made a positive contribution towards terminating the LGM."

 The Western Antarctic Peninsula is undergoing rapid environmental change. Regional warming is causing increased glacial meltwater discharge, but the ecological impact of this meltwater over large spatiotemporal scales is not well understood. Here, we leverage 20 years of remote sensing data, reanalysis products, and field observations to assess the effects of sea surface glacial meltwater on phytoplankton biomass and highlight its importance as a key environmental driver for this region’s productive ecosystem. We find a strong correlation between meltwater and phytoplankton chlorophyll-a across multiple time scales and datasets. We attribute this relationship to nutrient fertilization by glacial meltwater, with potential additional contribution from surface ocean stabilization associated with sea-ice presence. While high phytoplankton biomass typically follows prolonged winter sea-ice seasons and depends on the interplay between light and nutrient limitation, our results indicate that the positive effects of increased glacial meltwater on phytoplankton communities likely mitigate the negative impact of sea-ice loss in this region in recent years. Our findings underscore the critical need to consider glacial meltwater as a key ecological driver in polar coastal ecosystems.

 Explosive volcanic eruptions, driven by magma fragmentation, pose significant geohazards due to their rapid energy release and widespread dispersal of pyroclasts. High magma viscosity promotes brittle fragmentation by limiting volatile escape and enhancing internal pressure buildup. Although recent studies have recognized that iron-titanium oxide nanocrystal formation increases melt viscosity, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly constrained. Here we quantify the influence of nanocrystallization on magma viscosity by developing viscosity models that incorporate iron-titanium variations, calibrated against nanocrystal-free andesitic melts. Using time-resolved imaging, we show that nanocrystals form within seconds within synthetic andesitic melts. This process generates nanoscale chemical heterogeneities, including silica enrichment in the surrounding melt and aluminum-rich shells embedding the nanocrystals. These heterogeneities result in viscosity increases of up to 30-fold at eruptive temperatures. Our findings indicate that nanocrystallization modulates magma rheology during early crystallization, with direct implications for the dynamics of andesitic eruptions.

 Climate change is projected to cause significant and irreversible losses in mountain regions, severely impacting both people and ecosystems. Assessing adaptation in mountain regions is crucial to address diverse sectoral challenges and to mitigate the risks of maladaptation. Despite increasing awareness of the need to integrate adaptation across all sectors affected by climate change, the understanding of multi-sectoral solutions remains limited.

In contrast, technological/infrastructural and institutional responses, often anticipatory and associated with disaster-risk management, tourism, transportation and water sectors are highly prominent in Europe, especially in urban areas.

 In recent years new sensors and products have been developed to advance our capabilities in assessing human activities based on the remote sensing of night lights. Correctly understanding patterns in human activity and land use based on night lights, is key to gauge our advancement in reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In this paper I focus on five challenges in remote sensing of night lights. For each of these research challenges I provide a brief review of previous work, and then demonstrate how this challenge can be tackled, using a variety of ground-based sensors (TESS-4C, LANcube, SVC-HR1024 field spectrometer and webcams), UAV imagery, and spaceborne sensors (SDGSAT-1 and VIIRS/DNB). Challenge 1: Providing a cloud mask in future night light missions; Here I demonstrate that using a thermal night time image acquired simultaneously with the night time light image (as in the case for some of the SDGSAT-1 images), a cloud mask can be created, allowing to analyze night lights over cloud-free areas. Challenge 2: Monitoring hourly changes in night lights over a single night. Here I demonstrated that using mobile measurements conducted with a LANcube photometer at different hours, it was possible to detect locations where and when night lights have decreased during the night (e.g. a large sport stadium). In addition, using a citizen science webcam, I showed that hourly changes in night lights can be discerned even from a non-calibrated camera, and that within the city of Jerusalem, where there is a large population of orthodox Jews, certain land uses had less lights during holy days. Challenge 3: Fusing night time imagery from spaceborne sensors with different overpass times and spatial resolution to better understand hourly changes in night lights; merging SDGSAT-1 images (21:30 overpass) and VIIRS/DNB images (01:30 overpass) I was able to map the turning off of street lights across rural areas in France that accelerated since the 2022 energy crisis of Europe. Challenge 4: Estimating the emissions of blue light using night light sensors; here I demonstrated that the measured portion of blue light varies between ground based and spaceborne sensors, and that it is affected by atmospheric scattering; Challenge 5: Quantifying the anisotropy of night light emissions; here I demonstrated that using panoramic images acquired from a UAV at different heights, it is possible to examine how viewing angles affect the light sources that are observed. I conclude that while the number of designated night lights sensors is still limited, with the availability of new multispectral sensors, we can advance in our understanding of the dynamics of human activities at night-time, by fusing data from different sensors, to take advantage of the unique spatial, spectral, temporal and directional capabilities of each of them."

 The hotspot-sun angular offset (the spherical circular angle between hotspot and sun positions, termed ΔCA) in urban thermal anisotropy (UTA) plays a pivotal role in advancing remote sensing of urban climates. However, its diurnal and monthly variations across scenarios influenced by sun position, urban morphology, and thermal inertia remain largely unknown. Here we filled this knowledge gap based on 1049 UTA scenarios incorporating 12 urban surface models using both computer simulations and in-situ measurements. Our findings reveal ΔCA varies from 0° to 50° (predominantly 10° – 30°). Surface thermal inertia, urban morphology (i.e., building-street aspect ratio), and sun position collectively drive ΔCA variation, with their relative contributions exhibiting significant diurnal and monthly variabilities. In general, ΔCA is most pronounced around noon with relatively low thermal inertia (279–739 W·s1/2·m−1·K−1) and low aspect ratio values (< 1.5), leading to high ΔCA values exceeding 30°. Monthly ΔCA variations shows a bimodal pattern, with peaks (ΔCA is ∼25°) in April and August and a trough (ΔCA is ∼15°) from May to July around the summer solstice when the solar zenith angle (SZA) is relatively small. Hourly ΔCA variations exhibits sinusoidal variation during daytime, also characterized by a noon trough around the summer solstice. Troughs in diurnal/annual cycles are associated with small SZA (< 20°) and high sunlit roof/ground temperatures that ensure hotspot-sun adjacency. Our results indicate pronounced ΔCAs under scenarios with lower thermal inertia, lower aspect ratio, and midday periods in May to August. Our findings could facilitate designing kernel-driven models for simulating UTA."

 Methane is an important greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and climate change. The effective identification of atmospheric plumes in spatial images of methane concentration data retrieved from remote sensing is a critical step in quantifying emissions and ultimately helping to mitigate climate change by reducing large methane emission sources. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive efficient learning network (CELNet) for atmospheric plume detection, which is constructed with several deep neural modules and detects the shape of plumes in methane concentration images effectively. Specifically, to conduct an efficient plume identification, a generative module is constructed, which is tasked to generate feature maps for the characterisation of potential plumes in remotely sensed methane concentration data. This helps to reduce the search space in the detection implementation. Methane plumes in remotely sensed image data normally exhibit complex morphological structures with high background noise, which can interfere with the delineation of the shapes of plumes. Thus, the generative module alone cannot guarantee an accurate identification. To conduct high quality methane plume delineation, an extractor module is introduced to extract features that intrinsically characterise methane plumes in remotely sensed image data. The extracted intrinsic features are encoded using an encoder module for compact representation, which convey important information for implementing a better methane plume delineation. In particular, to enhance the capability of the generative module for generating accurate features, we structurally pair it with a discriminative module. In the training process, the discriminative module takes the generated features and the intrinsic features as inputs and improves its capability to discriminate the generated features from the intrinsic ones, whereas the generative module strives to generate accurate features that the discriminative module is unable to identify. They thus build an adversarial game which is beneficial for enhancing the feature generation capability of the generative module during the training process. The generated features along with the intrinsic features are then fed into the decoder module to produce accurate methane plume detection maps, where the intrinsic features incorporated provide additional supervision information that enables the CELNet to perform a more effective methane plume identification. We validate the proposed technique with different types of remote sensing image datasets (e.g., Landsat 5, AVIRIS-NG), and the accuracy achieved by CELNet outperforms the other comparison methods over 6%. This highlights its applicability for different sourced images with high performance, making it valuable for remote sensing community."

In addition, each of the algorithm coefficients are tuned specifically for each of the AVHRR instruments, using simulated Top of the atmosphere (TOA) TBs and ERA-Interim reanalysis surface and atmosphere data. Simulated TOA TB’s are computed using the community radiative transfer model, RTTOV v12.3. Spatially and temporally varying uncertainties are computed for each data-point. The C3S IST surface temperatures were validated against different in situ observation types, where comparison against radiometric temperatures from flight campaigns and ice sheet station data resulted in smaller mean differences of 0.20°C and -1.84°C in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than for validations against met station air temperatures, which were usually 1–3°C higher. Surface temperature climatology and trends have been computed for sea ice and ice sheets, showing large regional differences in surface temperature trends within the NH. For the entire dataset, the average trend is +1.11 °C/decade for the NH sea ice, +0.16 °C/decade for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) sea ice, +0.38 °C/decade for the Greenland ice sheet and -0.13 °C/decade for the Antarctic ice sheet. The positive trends are typically small during summer and larger during winter, e.g. in the Barents Sea, where trends exceed +0.3 °C/year in winter. Negative temperature trends are observed in some regions such as the Bering Strait’s ice edge. For Antarctic sea ice, the trends are generally smaller and statistically less significant than those in the NH. The trends of the ice sheet surface show a similar pattern, where the Greenland Ice Sheet has positive trends, which both are largest and most significant in the coastal areas. The Antarctic Ice Sheet has diverse trends and large areas have statistically non-significant trends, except for the negative temperature trend in the central, high altitude part of east Antarctica exceeding -0.5 °C/year."

 Climate change is dramatically shifting the distribution and prevalence of pests and diseases, posing significant threats to global forest ecosystems. Poplar plantations, particularly multiclonal ones, are highly vulnerable to pathogen-driven diseases such as leaf rust caused by Melampsora spp. In this study, we developed three machine learning (ML) detection models (DMs) for identifying rust-affected poplar trees coupling Sentinel-2 time series and the PROSAIL radiative transfer model. For each DM, three ML algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks) were trained using in situ leaf rust inspections as reference data, and the following inputs: (i) inverted plant traits retrieved from the PROSAIL model, (ii) key spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 time series, and (iii) a combination of both plant traits and indices from Sentinel-2 images. The best-performing DM, which combined plant traits and spectral indices, achieved an overall accuracy of 89.5 % (Kappa = 0.78) across three tested ML algorithms. Relative importance analysis highlighted chlorophylls (21 %), carotenoids (16 %), and leaf water content (11 %) as the most critical variables for rust detection. This study shows the potential of combining biophysical models with Sentinel-2 imagery for precise and scalable rust detection in multiclonal poplar plantations. Our approach also highlights how key plant traits, such as chlorophyll, carotenoids, and leaf water content, vary across poplar clones, offering valuable insights for forest management and conservation strategies in the context of climate change. The framework we propose is adaptable and transferable to different regions and conditions, enhancing disease monitoring and forest health management. Its robustness is further supported by external validation using the ANGERS spectral database, confirming the physiological relevance of the retrieved traits."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a crucial tool in remote sensing, yet existing deep learning methods are primarily limited in visual representation, neglecting the intrinsic characteristics of SAR and the need for strong generalization across multiple tasks. To address this, we propose SUMMIT (SAR foUndational Model with Multiple auxiliary tasks enhanced Intrinsic characterisTics), a foundational model tailored for SAR image understanding. SUMMIT is pre-trained on the Multi-sensor SAR Image Dataset (MuSID), which contains over 560,000 SAR images. To enhance its feature extraction capability, we introduce a masked image modeling (MIM) framework with self-supervised auxiliary tasks (SSATs): (1) MIM for learning robust structural representations, (2) self-supervised denoising to improve the model’s noise resistance, and (3) space scattering feature enhancement to preserve geometric consistency. Furthermore, we design an auxiliary task coordination module (ATCM) to balance these tasks and ensure effective feature fusion. The resulting self-supervised framework enables SUMMIT to integrate deep learning with SAR’s physical attributes effectively. Extensive experiments across seven datasets and three downstream tasks demonstrate that SUMMIT achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in SAR classification, detection, and segmentation.

 The accurate extraction of building roof structures from aerial imagery represents a fundamental task for urban digital twin systems, facilitating critical applications such as 3D city modeling and solar potential assessment. Despite recent advancements in geospatial artificial intelligence, existing methods frequently encounter challenges posed by real-world complexities. These include structural heterogeneity caused by diverse architectural styles, discontinuities in roof structures due to occlusions from vegetation and other obstacles, and the limited generalization ability of models stemming from the scarcity of specialized annotated datasets. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end network called RoofMapNet, specifically designed for extracting roof structures. First, we propose a strategy for roof junction extraction that integrates dynamic Gaussian heatmaps with quadratic coordinate calibration. This strategy enhances the model’s robustness in junction prediction under heterogeneous sample distribution scenarios. To address the loss or blurring of roof lines caused by occlusion and shadow, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware module. This module employs a bidirectional mapping between geometric and feature spaces to refine candidate lines accurately, thus improving the model’s generalization ability and robustness in roof line detection. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of roof structure detection models, we meticulously annotated a diverse, large-scale remote sensing imagery dataset for roof structure extraction, named RoofMapSet. Comprehensive evaluations on the VWB and RoofMapSet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with mean sAP improvements of 4.13% and 2.85% over competitors, respectively.

 Port cities are often burdened by elevated air pollution levels due to ship emissions and harbour-related activities such as cargo handling and internal traffic. This study investigates the concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and selected metals/metalloids (Pb, As, Cd, Ni, V, Co, Cu, Cr, Zn, Mn, Fe) bound to the inhalable particulate matter (PM10) in the port of Volos (central Greece), the fourth largest in the country. Data were collected over a five-year period (2018–2022), allowing for the assessment of interannual variability. A risk assessment was conducted using standard U.S. EPA methodologies to estimate both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks through inhalation exposure, separately for adults and children. The results revealed that the cumulative non-cancer risk from EU-regulated PM10-bound metal(loid)s (As, Ni, Cd, Pb) remained well below the threshold of 1 × 10−6, indicating acceptable exposure levels. However, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) contributed significantly to the non-cancer risk—30 % for children and 20 % for adults. The inhalation lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for the metal(loid)s exceeded the U.S. EPA's safety threshold (1 × 10−6), reaching 5.1 × 10−5 for children and 5.7 × 10−5 for adults, with lead (Pb) being the predominant contributor. In contrast, the ILCR of Σ12PAHs was nearly two orders of magnitude lower.

Conversely, the TC exhibits a noticeably slower translation speed and deviates significantly from the observed track in the experiment using the Yonsei University (YSU) PBL scheme. The potential vorticity tendency (PVT) budget analysis reveals that the diabatic heating related to the asymmetric convection within the TC inner-core has a negative impact on the translation speed of TC. The in-cloud mixing effect in the YSU scheme is conducive to transporting the moisture from the boundary layer to the upper levels, promoting the development of asymmetric deep convection and the enhancing diabatic heating.

 Extreme precipitation events in the winter season (WEPEs) over Southeast China cause tremendous social and economic loss with spatiotemporal variability across scales, making it important to study the complicated triggering mechanisms and further to improve seamless forecasting skills for winter extreme precipitation events (WEPEs). Based on a daily precipitation dataset from 2474 stations across China from 1961 to 2023, an objective identification metric was employed to identify 347 WEPEs over Southeast China. Synthesis analysis was performed by using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data to study the circulation features across large-scale, synoptic scale, and sub-synoptic scale. Results show that WEPEs occur more frequently in the central region rather than the northern and southern coastal areas. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function and objective pattern correlation statistics, 279 WEPEs were classified into five categories, i.e. Huai River Basin type (HR), Yangtze River Middle-Lower Reaches type (YR), Central Southeast China type (CSE), Southeast China type (SE), and South China type (SC). Similarities among the five types are concluded from two perspectives. On one hand, large-scale and synoptic scale characteristics all present anomalous troughs in the lower troposphere over South China extending to the Indochinese Peninsula, which deepened the southern branch trough (SBT), and anomalous positive geopotential height anomalies near northeast China and Japan in the form of the Northeast Asian anomalous anticyclone (NAAA). On the other hand, the unbalanced winds in the lower atmosphere coincide with precipitation areas and intensity of the five types of WEPEs. Differences are evident in locations and intensities of both scale systems resulting to different moisture transports. Moisture transport from the NAAA in HR and YR types is greater than from the SBT. Moisture in the CSE type mainly comes from the SBT, while it originates from the combined effects of the SBT and the NAAA in the SE and SC types. What's more, the unbalanced winds of sub-synoptic scales more accurately highlight similarities and differences in moisture transport channels over heavy precipitating areas compared to ageostrophic wind."

 This study investigates the processes driving interannual variability of rainfall over the western coast of the Philippines during the peak southwest monsoon (SWM) months (July–September) from 1961 to 2022. Specifically, it describes how tropical cyclones (TC), SWM, and TC-enhanced SWM influence SWM rainfall variability. Rainfall measurements from 11 stations along the western coast of the Philippines were classified into three types: direct TC rainfall (PD), indirect TC rainfall (PI), and SWM rainfall (PSM). The yearly contributions of PD, PI, and PSM to SWM rainfall were estimated to be 15.4 %, 33.1 %, and 51.5 %, respectively. Furthermore, four rainfall variability types were found depending on the characteristics of each year's rainfall anomalies: enhanced PD but suppressed PSM (D+S-), suppressed PD but enhanced PSM (D-S+), enhanced PI but suppressed PSM (I+S-), and suppressed PI but enhanced PSM (I-S+). Composite analysis using ERA5 data revealed the presence of anomalous winds and circulations unique to each type that causes variations in the TC tracks and the monsoon flow, which accounts for the rainfall variability. Notable ones are the anomalous anticyclone over Taiwan in the D+S- case, which pushes TCs closer to the Philippines, and the anomalous anticyclone east of the Philippines in the I+S- case, which enhances the trade winds."

The trend analysis showed a statistically significant (SS) decreasing trend in BC mass concentration of 0.57 μg m−3y−1 (6.7 % y−1). The SS decreasing rate observed in BC from fossil fuels (BCff) is 0.51 μg m−3y−1 and in BC from biomass burning (BCbb) is 0.06 μg m−3y−1. In comparison, the meteorological and satellite parameters show statistically insignificant change, pointing towards the effectiveness of policies such as Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), implications of Bharat Stage (BS) norms, emission control measures, and shifts towards cleaner fuels. A negligible fall in BCbb results in its increasing contribution (1.17 % y−1) towards BC, suggesting the need of aimed measures to deal with BB practices. During the PoM season, a peak in the high compensation parameter (K) of 0.00896 is observed, indicating freshly emitted BC aerosols typically associated with BB activities and fossil fuels. A high-frequency peak at a low K value (−0.00312) is observed during W only, indicating the presence of aged aerosols with enhanced scattering properties.

 This study applies the Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) algorithm to investigate the causal relationship between Arctic Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) and the Siberian High (SH) from a causal perspective. The main results are as follows: 1) Both autumn and winter pan-Arctic SIC have a causal influence on the winter SH, and the causal influence of autumn SIC on SH being significantly stronger than that of winter SIC. 2) The causal strength of autumn SIC on the SH differs by region, being most potent in the Barents-Kara Sea and least in the Greenland Sea. Nonetheless, the trends in interannual variations in causal strength are uniform, with a notable intensification in the impact of autumn SIC on SH across various regions after 1998. 3) A comparison of the circulation patterns before and after 1998 reveals that the reduction in the autumn Arctic SIC may affect the SH through stratospheric pathways. Specifically, after 1998, the accelerated reduction in the autumn Arctic SIC has weakened the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and the westerly jet, enhanced cold air activities, which in turn strengthened the SH. This study will enhance the comprehension of the impact of Arctic sea ice decline on the SH and its potential as an early warning signal. Additionally, it will improve the understanding of the causal relationships between Arctic sea ice and mid-latitude climate, which can help in forecasting extreme cold events."

The highly efficient hole-doping enables high-performance p-type 2D transistors with an ultralow contact resistance of ~0.041 kilohm micrometers and a record-high ON-state current density of ~2.30 milliamperes per micrometer."

It is not understood whether it represents an adaptive or maladaptive response toPlasmodiumspp. infection. We found that asymptomaticP. falciparuminfection in humans was associated with a higher ratio of unconjugated over conjugated bilirubin and parasite burden compared with symptomatic malaria. Genetic suppression of bilirubin synthesis by biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) increased parasite virulence and malaria mortality in mice. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in plasma, through genetic inhibition of hepatic conjugation by UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was protective against malaria in mice. Unconjugated bilirubin inhibitedP. falciparumproliferation in red blood cells by a mechanism that suppressed mitochondrial pyrimidine synthesis. Moreover, unconjugated bilirubin inhibited hemozoin crystallization and compromised the parasite’s food vacuole. Hence, jaundice appears to represent a metabolic response toPlasmodiumspp. infection that limits malaria severity."

A long-held structure-property relationship is that centrosymmetric crystals cannot differentially absorb circularly polarized light. In this study, we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and characterization of the centrosymmetric material Li2Co3(SeO3)4, which violates this relationship not by defying symmetry-imposed selection rules but by invoking a photophysical process not previously characterized for crystalline solids. This process originates from an interference between linear dichroism and linear birefringence, referred to as LD-LB, and involves strong chiroptical signals that invert upon sample flipping. In addition to enabling a chiroptical response under centrosymmetry, this process opens up photonic engineering opportunities based on crystalline solids."

We discovered that bacteria can overcome this limitation by acquiring nutrients by lysing neighboring cells through contact-dependent antagonism.

By querying 1375 genomes of the species-rich Malawi cichlid fish radiation, we discovered five large inversions segregating in the benthic subradiation that each suppress recombination over more than half a chromosome. Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagicDiplotaxodonthrough admixture, whereas the others established early in the deep benthic clade. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage, and a notable excess of protein changing substitutions points toward selection on neurosensory, physiological, and reproductive genes. These results indicate that repeated interplay between depth adaptation and sex-specific selection on large inversions has been central to the evolution of this iconic system."

Ultimately, preinvasive lesions developed from a few highly mutated clones that dominate most of the bronchial tree. Multisite sequencing in human patients confirmed the presence of clonally related preinvasive lesions across distinct airway regions.

This Earth energy imbalance has strengthened over the period 2001 to 2023 with satellite data. Here, we show that low climate sensitivity models fail to reproduce the trend in Earth energy imbalance, particularly in the individual longwave and shortwave contributions to the imbalance trend. The inability to produce a strong positive shortwave and strong negative longwave Earth energy imbalance trend is found to be a robust feature in the low climate sensitivity models, especially for models with a climate sensitivity below 2.5 kelvin. The negative longwave contribution to Earth energy imbalance is driven by surface temperature increases and is therefore most pronounced in high climate sensitivity models, whereas the shortwave contribution is generally positive and amplified by greater surface warming."
