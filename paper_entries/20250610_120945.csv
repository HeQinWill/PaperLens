Large-scale nonlinear and possibly irreversible changes in system state, such as AMOC weakening or rainforest-savanna transitions in the Amazon basin, would have severe impacts on ecosystems and human societies worldwide. In order to improve future tipping risk assessments, understanding interactions between tipping elements is crucial. The AMOC is known to influence the Intertropical Convergence Zone, potentially altering precipitation patterns over the AR and affecting its stability. However, AMOC-AR interactions are currently not well understood. Here, we identify a previously unknown stabilising interaction pathway from the AMOC onto the Southern AR, applying an established causal discovery and inference approach to tipping element interactions for the first time. Analysing observational and reanalysis data from 1982–2022, we show that AMOC weakening leads to increased precipitation in the Southern AR during the critical dry season, in line with findings from recent Earth system model experiments. Specifically, we report a 4.8% increase of mean dry season precipitation in the Southern AR for every 1 Sv of AMOC weakening. This finding is consistent across multiple data sources and AMOC strength indices. We show that, predicated on recent estimates of AMOC weakening, this stabilising interaction has offset 17% of dry season precipitation decrease in the Southern AR since 1982. Our results demonstrate the potential of causal discovery methods for analysing tipping element interactions based on reanalysis and observational data. By improving the understanding of AMOC-AR interactions, we contribute toward better constraining the risk of potential climate tipping cascades under global warming."

These changes can profoundly affect the regional climate system by altering the surface energy balance, moisture fluxes, and atmospheric circulation, potentially exacerbating the vulnerability of human, ecological, and economic systems. Despite the ability of climate models to simulate LCC impacts, considerable uncertainties remain, particularly in simulations of precipitation and temperature responses. This study provides the first multidisciplinary systematic review of LCC impacts in West Africa. Data from 26 selected publications were eventually synthesized from an initial pool of nearly 6000 studies. Results indicate that deforestation generally contributes to regional warming, with significant historical temperature increases of +0.26 ± 0.12 °C and projected increases of +0.88 ± 0.25 °C under the future scenarios. Conversely, afforestation could have significantly cooled the climate, lowering temperatures by −0.24 ± 0.14 °C historically and −0.22 ± 0.14 °C in future scenarios, without even accounting for carbon sequestration. Deforestation decreases regional precipitation by 80 ± 58 mm yr−1 historically and −55 ± 102 mm yr−1 in future scenarios, while large-scale afforestation could substantially reduce droughts with increased precipitation, averaging +40 ± 67 mm yr−1 historically and 80 ± 58 mm yr−1 in future scenarios. These results emphasize the need to integrate LCC-induced climate effects into land-based mitigation strategies, climate policy, and assessment frameworks."

Polvani,Effective Heat Capacity and Its Role in Arctic Amplification,"Arctic amplification (AA), referring to the greater warming of the Arctic relative to lower latitudes, is a robust feature in observations and in climate model simulations driven by increasing greenhouse gases. In this study, we examine the rapid development of AA following abrupt CO2 quadrupling in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. We show that this rapid development of AA is a consequence of the Arctic's lower effective heat capacity compared to the tropics and global mean. The Arctic's lower heat capacity, which is due to the presence of sea ice, leads to polar‐amplified warming in response to CO2 radiative forcing alone. However, the full magnitude of AA can only be understood by also considering the feedbacks and energy transport changes that act to preferentially warm the Arctic region."

This phenomenon makes the Arctic climate particularly sensitive to change if the conditions that support one of these states vanish. This study examines 25 years of in‐situ data from the North Slope of Alaska to investigate how these two states have changed over time. While November once had nearly equal occurrences of both states, the transmissive state has almost completely disappeared, resulting in an increase of over 30 W/m2 ${\text{W/m}}^{2}$ in surface downwelling longwave radiation since the turn of the century. This dramatic shift highlights a crucial climate feedback that any region prone to sea ice loss may experience—reducing the transmissive state enhances atmospheric warming and moistening, further promoting the opaque state. This feedback accelerates surface energy imbalances and could amplify Arctic change beyond current projections."

Dannenberg,Recent and Future Climate Extremes in the Northeastern Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau Under Anthropogenic Forcing,"The northeastern Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau experienced a persistently wet regime since the 1960s. However, a severe drought occurred in the summer of 2023, pointing to the critical need to assess recent and future precipitation changes in this climate hotspot. Leveraging a newly developed millennial tree‐ring reconstruction with climate simulations, we show that both the recent humidification and precipitation deficit are exceptional, and the wet‐to‐dry transition is unprecedented over the past millennium. Despite model discrepancies and uncertainties, a subset of climate model simulations reproduced the multidecadal precipitation variability. Natural variability dominated the pre‐industrial precipitation patterns, while anthropogenic greenhouse gases are responsible for the recent humidification. Using a correlation‐based data‐model comparison, the region is projected to receive higher precipitation than its last‐millennium baseline through 2100, potentially exceeding the full‐ensemble estimates of CMIP6 projections. However, low‐precipitation summers similar to 2023 remain possible and, combined with future warming, could significantly impact regional ecosystems and socio‐economic systems."

This study introduces a novel methodology for monitoring near‐surface seismic attenuation variations using repetitive seismic noise sources. Our approach employs a single‐station technique to quantify seismic attenuation variations by evaluating the linear relationship between the frequency and spectrum amplitude variations. We applied this method in the Lyon water catchment area, utilizing train tremors as a continuous and stable seismic source. The case study demonstrates that seismic attenuation variations correlate strongly with environmental factors such as rainfall and significant changes in the water table due to a flood event. This methodology offers an effective and practical means to continuously monitor the subsurface seismic attenuation using opportune noise sources, providing valuable insights into groundwater dynamics and subsurface processes."

Mixed‐phase stratiform clouds are of particular interest due to their ubiquity in the Arctic. Here, we present a new long‐term data set composed of various observations specifically designed to identify cloud controlling factors of mixed‐phase cloud properties in the Arctic. We find that Arctic cloud properties are largely controlled by meteorological properties, whereby a warmer, drier, and more stable environment acts to decrease cloud fraction, water path, and median volume particle size. However, understanding the influence of changes in aerosols cannot be neglected and are essential in understanding the difference in the responses of liquid and ice water. We find that sulfur‐based aerosols primarily control liquid processes of clouds while carbon‐based aerosols primarily control ice processes of clouds."

Here we present in situ observations of melt at near‐vertical ice faces using a novel instrument platform mounted rigidly to icebergs. We investigate boundary layer dynamics controlling melt across 31 measurement periods that span a range of momentum and thermal forcing (1–12 cm/s flows and 3–10 K). While melt generally scales with velocity and temperature, we find substantially enhanced melt linked with unsteady forcing. Several implementations of the three‐equation melt parameterization show melt can be predicted within a factor of 2 if the model is evaluated with peak near‐boundary velocities and flows are quasi‐steady. However, if flows are unsteady or the model is evaluated with low‐resolution velocities, melt is underpredicted by 2–75×. $75\times .$ We conclude that understanding the detailed character of near‐boundary flows is critical for submarine melt predictions."

Based on the precipitating fluxes estimated from Polar‐orbiting Observational Environmental Satellites, we quantify the REP‐induced atmospheric chemical effects using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model. Present results show that direct stratospheric ionization caused by REP can enhance the NOx concentration by a factor of ∼2.58 at ∼37 km altitude, and the HOx concentration by a factor of ∼6.41 at ∼44 km altitude. As for the annual variation, REP causes an additional ozone loss of ∼16.2%–17.1% at ∼30–35 km altitude during winter. Moreover, REP's impact is not confined to winter since the resultant NOx and HOx production occurs in situ. Therefore, neglecting REP would significantly underestimate EEP's total effects on the stratospheric ozone."

Typically, the inclusions are trapped as minerals which are only stable in the deep mantle, retrogressing into multiple phases during their uplift. Determining the bulk inclusion composition is difficult but crucially important. Here we use micron‐scale synchrotron X‐ray computed tomography alongside μ‐Raman mapping to reconstruct primary inclusion compositions of seven former Ti‐rich CaSi‐perovskite inclusions, which had retrogressed to assemblages of breyite and perovskite. The inclusions display Ti#s (molar Ti/[Ti + Si]), ranging from 0.03 to 0.60. In diamonds with previously reported coexisting inclusions, former bridgmanite coexists with lower Ti# CaSi‐perovskite and garnet inclusions with higher Ti# CaSi‐perovskite. This observation is consistent with published petrological experiments on mafic compositions suggesting that CaSi‐perovskite undergoes a decrease in Ti# after the post‐garnet transition. Thus variations in Ti content of CaSi‐perovskite inclusions are interpreted as differences in formation pressures."

The 2024 El Niño exhibited a wet signal over California, but it was notably weaker. Observed SST anomalies for this winter included a contribution from SST warming trends and pronounced Atlantic warming that was much larger than attributable to SST warming trends alone. Sensitivity experiments indicated that SST trends suppressed California precipitation by disrupting traditional El Niño teleconnection patterns, particularly in southern California. Atlantic warming contributed to North Pacific anticyclonic anomalies, opposing typical El Niño‐induced wet conditions. These findings highlight the role of inter‐basin SST interactions and of trends in shaping atmospheric responses and underscore the importance of regional and global SST variations in modulating ENSO teleconnections."

Using observations and state‐of‐the‐art subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) models, the influence of the MJO on total precipitation (P) and TC‐related precipitation (TCP) is analyzed across MJO phases. Results indicate that TCs significantly contribute to the MJO's modulation of precipitation, particularly in regions like the Gulf Coast, Florida, and western Mexico. The anomalous probability of extreme precipitation events associated with the MJO is strongly linked to the MJO‐TCP connection, highlighting the importance of capturing these interactions for reliable S2S forecasts of precipitation.

 Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) and related carbon nanorings (CNRs) represent iconic molecular entities in molecular nanocarbon science. While theoretical studies predict that the introduction of nitrogen atoms (N-doping) onto CPP frameworks would add a number of fascinating properties, only a handful of partially N-doped carbon nanorings have been synthesized.

 Rocket emissions thin the stratospheric ozone layer. To understand if significant ozone losses could occur as the launch industry grows, we examine two scenarios. Our ‘ambitious’ scenario (2040 launches/year) yields a −0.29% depletion in annual-mean, near-global total column ozone in 2030. Antarctic springtime ozone decreases by 3.9%. Our ‘conservative’ scenario (884 launches/year) yields −0.17% annual, near-global depletion; current licensing rates suggest this scenario may be exceeded before 2030. Ozone losses are driven by the chlorine produced from solid rocket motor propellant, and black carbon which is emitted from most propellants. The ozone layer is slowly healing from the effects of CFCs, yet global-mean ozone abundances are still 2% lower than measured prior to the onset of CFC-induced ozone depletion. Our results demonstrate that ongoing and frequent rocket launches could delay ozone recovery. Action is needed now to ensure that future growth of the launch industry and ozone protection are mutually sustainable."

 Harmful algal blooms contaminate seafood with toxins and poison humans and wildlife upon consumption. Toxic algae niches are projected to expand in high latitudes, but how the frequency of their blooms will evolve is still little known. Here we use climate models, 14 years of observations and probabilistic models of toxic algae, to assess the frequency of harmful algal blooms in a future warmer world. The warmer ocean temperatures increase the blooms in spring and autumn. However, the blooms reduce in summer as surface waters become excessively warm. Freshening reduces the blooms of species confined to high salinity ranges and has no effect on increasing the blooms. In a 3 °C warmer world, the blooms of D. acuta might increase by 50% and A. tamarense complex reduce by 40% along the Norwegian coast. Therefore, humans and wildlife are likely to become more exposed to diarrheic toxins and less to paralytic toxins.

 In the 2023 summer, wildfires in Canada were exceptionally intense, producing the highest carbon emissions recorded since 2003 and affecting much of North America. However, the factors driving the 2023 wildfires and their interactions remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the 2023 Canadian wildfires were primarily fueled by persistent, intense and widespread summer surface warming, along with pronounced reductions in precipitation and soil moisture. These conditions were closely linked to unusually frequent, wide, long-lasting and eastward-moving North American blocking events. We reveal that an unusually strong negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation and an Eastern Pacific El Niño in the 2023 summer play a crucial role in promoting these blocking patterns. Furthermore, we find that abnormally low precipitation and soil moisture during the preceding winter and spring served as critical precursors, compounding summer fire risk by preconditioning the landscape. Our findings offer new insights into the underlying causes of the 2023 Canadian wildfires.

 Reservoir drought is a valuable indicator of regional hydrological drought severity; however, it has received limited attention because of the low quality of reservoir storage data. This study proposes a Remote Sensing-Based High-Resolution Reservoir Drought Index (RS-HRDI) that integrates recent high-resolution satellite observations with historical low-resolution records to construct a long-term reservoir storage dataset. Reservoir droughts are identified by periods of abnormally low reservoir storage using a time-variant threshold. The RS-HRDI was used to detect reservoir droughts in the Yangtze River Basin, one of the most reservoir-regulated and critical river systems globally, from 2018 to 2023, including a record-breaking drought in 2022. The results indicate that the multi-satellite combination significantly improved the reservoir observation frequency from the historical monthly scale to an average of 4.3 d, enabling the detection of rapid reservoir storage reductions within days. The RS-HRDI could effectively identify droughts across various reservoirs and accurately describe their characteristics. Through comprehensive assessments of widespread reservoir networks, the aggregated RS-HRDI effectively characterized basin-scale hydrological droughts, detailing their spatial extent, intensity, and duration. Furthermore, the RS-HRDI highlighted the influence of reservoir operations on the occurrence and propagation of hydrological droughts in a river system. Specifically, upstream reservoir interception advanced downstream droughts by 2–40 d. This study presents a novel reservoir drought assessment method based on remote sensing, highlighting its potential for use in large-scale and timely hydrological drought monitoring and water resource management."

 Particulate organic nitrates (pON) are important nitrogen-containing compounds in ambient aerosols that have considerable impacts on air quality, nutrient inputs, and biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen. pON, estimated via the fragmentation ratios of NO2+ and NO + ions detected by the quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation monitor, was investigated at a coastal site in Shanghai. Among organic aerosols, more-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA) was the dominate group throughout the whole year. pON accounted for considerable fractions of OA and the total nitrate with strong seasonal variations. Receptor modeling apportioned the nitrate-related production as the largest source of pON, indicating the significance of secondary formation pathway. Analysis of various influencing factors on pON indicated that aqueous-phase chemistry played the most significant role in the formation of pON in four seasons, while the photochemical pathway was also contributing in summer. Reactions among the nitrogenous precursors and VOCs (mainly alkanes and aromatics) facilitated by aerosol liquid water promoted the formation of pON. Under high humidity conditions, the mass yield of pON was particularly favored compared to its inorganic counterpart. This study signified the importance of accurate quantification of pON in the future research, which has scientific implications on the formation mechanisms of organic aerosols, nitrogen deposition, and biogeochemical cycle of key elements in the coastal environment."

 Aerosols and clouds significantly influence the climate system. This paper systematically reviews the microphysical processes of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI), recent advances in precipitation studies, associated radiative effects, and the development of observational techniques. The primary mechanisms of the ACI process depend on the cloud type and evolutionary stage, with distinct interactions identified for liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds. Understanding the effects of aerosols on ice and mixed-phase clouds poses greater challenges than on liquid clouds. In terms of climate effects, we summarize recent advancements regarding how aerosols influence precipitation by affecting the characteristics and development of clouds, including their impacts on precipitation amount, distribution area, onset timing, and vertical structure. Statistical analyses reveal a weakening negative trend in global ACI-induced radiative forcing and effective radiative forcing, linked to declining aerosol concentrations in many regions, which accelerates climate change. Regarding observational techniques, the joint observation strategy, by integrating the advantages of different techniques, provides a multi-angle view and improves the temporal and spatial resolution and accuracy of the data. Finally, challenges to ACI research are discussed. By reporting the latest research results and methods, this review will help to provide the current state of knowledge on ACI and their impact on climate, providing valuable insights for those working on this research."
