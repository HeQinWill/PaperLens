The co-occurrence of these flood drivers is generally assumed to exacerbate the resulting flood impacts, a result referred to as compound flooding. However, few observational or modeling studies have investigated the circumstances under which this occurs. Here, we study the impacts of these combined flood drivers and evaluate the implicit hypothesis of official flood maps, which is that rainfall has a negligible impact on the flood depth and flooded area due to a 100 year coastal flood. A coastal system model, configured to capture coastal and pluvial flood drivers, is used. We evaluate the flooding for different urban landform types, including coastal landfill (human-made land), convergent areas (topographic depressions) and other urban terrain, within a model domain covering the Jamaica Bay watershed of New York City. A scenario-based strategy is adopted with a 100 year coastal flood as a control simulation, to which we add a set of realistic scenarios of rainfall data from historical tropical cyclones. We also apply a joint probability analysis framework with historical data to evaluate the probability of these compound coastal-pluvial scenarios. Results reveal cases where the pluvial driver compounds the coastal flood through expansion of the flood zone, with a 17% chance of rainfall increasing the flood area by 6%–38%, and a 5% chance of an increase of 61%–73%. It is rare that floods are significantly deepened but when deepening occurs, it is more common for the convergent zone than for the coastal landfill. These findings quantitatively assess the potential of the pluvial driver to exacerbate flooding, which may influence emergency management strategies such as evacuation plans, shelter arrangements, and related preparedness measures."

The objectives of this project are to contribute towards a more comprehensive understanding of air quality in Providence and support environmental justice, community health, and greenhouse gas reduction goals. Towards these objectives, Breathe Providence developed an integrated sensor network design approach, balancing both community and scientific priorities in the monitoring site selection process to maximize (1) community investment and collaboration, and (2) data quality and utility. Enabled by partnerships with community-based organizations, guidance from the Providence Climate Justice Plan, and findings from low-cost sensing literature, Breathe Providence’s site selection strategy operated at both the geographic and host-specific levels to prioritize data utility for community members, researchers, and decision-makers alike. The two-stage network design process employed a Providence-based air quality vulnerability index to guide and evaluate network development at a geographic level, and a community-informed definition of ‘meaningful’ to guide it at the sensor host level. The result of these efforts is a network of air monitoring stations throughout Providence that is primarily hosted by community-serving institutions and is weighted towards neighborhoods with higher vulnerability to air pollution. The network successfully represents the priorities of the Climate Justice Plan and community-based project partners on both a geographic and sensor host level. Sensor hosts have become meaningfully involved through the co-planning of public events, which have in turn broadened the project’s channels for public outreach. Scientific considerations were largely compatible with community criteria: by supporting data quality and completeness, they supported the broader policy applicability goals stressed by community partners. The site selection process presents an essential opportunity to build relationships and align monitoring priorities; as a result, it better positions networks to yield community-relevant benefits."

To evaluate their actual impact, this paper analyzes trade regulations on high-deforestation commodities under three scenarios: two based on EU measures and one exploring a globally coordinated implementation of import regulations on countries with high deforestation risk (HDR). We use a policy assessment framework based on MAGNET, a global general equilibrium model, to analyze the impact on trade, production and land use change. Our results indicate that EU-only measures can substantially reduce HDR imports into the EU, but the global impact remains limited given the EU’s modest share of world demand for products from countries with HDR. By contrast, a globally coordinated regulation targeting HDR countries would expand forest land in these countries and substantially reduce their production and trade, while shifting these activities to other parts of the world."

However, comprehensive monitoring of terrestrial ecosystems is challenging, partially because of the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of land cover and vegetation structure. While forest ecosystems are relatively well studied, knowledge of trees outside forests (TOFs) is limited, even though TOF contribute substantially to many ecosystem services. In this study, we leveraged advances in remote sensing and modeling to quantify TOF and their contribution to the 2011–2023 Maryland state carbon budget. Specifically, the Ecosystem Demography model was initialized with 1 m airborne optical and LiDAR data. These datasets were combined with 30 m National Land Cover Database maps to identify and monitor TOF statewide. In the base year, TOF contributed to 22.86% (2795.59 km2) of the total tree cover, 14.70% (15.98 Tg C) of the total aboveground live tree carbon stocks, and 22.56% (0.39 Tg C yr−1) of the corresponding carbon fluxes in the state, with variation by land cover class. TOF on developed and planted/cultivated lands contributed approximately 90% of the total TOF tree cover and carbon stocks, as well as over 96% of the total TOF carbon fluxes. Most TOF occurred as polygons smaller than 1 km2 and were within 600 m distance from forests. From 2011–2023, persistent TOF carbon stocks were estimated to increase by 5.15 Tg C, representing 23.71% of the state’s total increase in tree carbon stocks over the interval, with substantial interannual variability in carbon fluxes. These results suggest TOF are an important contribution to statewide tree cover and produce carbon stocks and fluxes that should be highlighted in carbon budgets for effective monitoring and assessment. Moving forward, efforts are needed to expand the availability and application of high-resolution remote sensing data and models needed for TOF quantification in carbon budgets."

This study investigates whether the ‘hot’ Earth system models (ESMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, whose past warming trends are typically greater than the observations, tend to overestimate future temperature and precipitation changes across the global maize harvesting areas. By applying an emergent constraint (EC) approach to 30 ESMs, we assess the future mean and extreme temperature (ΔTave and ΔTmax) and precipitation (ΔPave and ΔPmax) changes during maize growing seasons. We find that ΔTave, ΔTmax, and ΔPmax averaged over the global harvesting regions are significantly correlated with the past global mean temperature trends, indicating that hot ESMs tend to overestimate the future changes in these variables. ECs reduce the inter-ESM variances in these projections by 43%, 39%, and 18%, respectively. Notably, the regions with the highest maize production, such as the USA and China, are projected to experience the greatest increases in ΔTave and ΔTmax. The fraction of the global maize production exposed to historically rare high temperatures increases substantially in the raw projections but is moderated when ECs are applied. These findings suggest that the use of hot ESMs may lead to overestimated impacts of climate change on maize and that EC methods offer a robust pathway for refining impact assessments."

A critical parameter in most SEB models is the surface temperature of wet or dry boundaries where sensible heat (H) or latent heat (LE) equals 0, which is difficult to measure or estimate. The wide application of SEB models is seriously limited due to this challenge. Therefore, this study introduces ‘critical canopy temperature ( )’, defined as the canopy temperature at which LE equals 0, corresponding to the dry boundary in SEB models. We develop a physics-constrained machine learning (ML) model (hybrid model) that conserves the SEB equation to predict using meteorological measurements from 103 eddy-covariance (EC) stations combined with remote-sensing data. The predicted is integrated into the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model to replace the dry boundary, thereby to improve the estimation of LE estimation. Results demonstrate that the hybrid model effectively captures canopy temperature anomalies during stomatal closure and achieve better generalization than pure ML approaches in LE estimation, particularly under extreme conditions. Compared with conventional dry-boundary selection scheme without SEB constraints, incorporating significantly improve SEBAL performance, reducing the root mean square error for LE from 119.33 to 81.71 W m−2 against EC observations (at 31.52% reduction). At regional scales, the hybrid model enables pixel-level estimation of , addressing the long-standing challenge of dry-boundary underrepresentation. Overall, the hybrid model provides a robust and accurate framework for predicting theoretical dry-boundary temperatures while conserving the SEB, supporting improved monitoring of vegetation physiological status and enhancing the accuracy of SEB models."

At the same time, advocates of impact-based accounting argue for global REC markets, purposefully abandoning deliverability in favor of enabling cost-effective displacement of fossil power generation. At this point, the extent to which claims by individual e-fuel producers diverge from actual emissions under different potential regulations remains unclear. This study uses a hypothetical e-methanol case to investigate (1) how accounting requirements of different policy regimes affect the accuracy of inventory emissions, and (2) how these reported values compare with emissions estimated under an impact-based accounting perspective. Our results show that hourly energy matching is needed for accurate inventory accounting. When production is not aligned in time and place with renewable generation, reported emissions increase substantially. If RECs are non-additional, emissions can be 14–28 times higher than stated for hourly energy matching under inventory accounting, with carbon intensities exceeding those of the fossil reference fuel, stressing the critical role of additionality. Out of six scenarios, only hourly energy matching results in methanol that can be considered renewable according to EU regulation (i.e. below 28.2 gCO2e/MJ). Impact-based accounting shows potential for larger reductions, up to almost three times the inventory emissions when based on RECs from regions with high marginal emission factors. However, these reductions do not influence the company’s inventory and should be treated as complementary to it. Thus, to ensure accurate inventory claims, deliverability and additionality are crucial. Although based on a single e-fuel producer, the findings can apply broadly to other electricity consumers."

Souri;Gonzalo González Abad;Bryan N. Duncan;Luke D. Oman,Beyond binary maps from HCHO∕NO2: a deep neural network approach to global daily mapping of net ozone production rates and sensitivities constrained by satellite observations (2005–2023),"We create long-term maps of PO3 magnitudes along with their corresponding sensitivity maps. This is achieved using a deep learning parameterization method that relies on satellite data, atmospheric models, and ground-based remote sensing. Our approach provides more quantitative information than commonly used methods that depend on ratio-based indicators (such as HCHO/NO2). Additionally, our method considers light and water vapor, making it suitable for applications with GEO satellites. 
 Previous studies on net ozone production rates (PO3) and their sensitivities to precursors relied on limited in-situ data, often coarse and uncertain chemical transport models (CTMs), and ozone indicators like the formaldehyde-to-nitrogen dioxide ratio (FNR). However, FNR fails to fully capture PO3's complex relationships with pollution, light, and water vapor. To address this, we refine the satellite-based PO3 product from Souri et al. (2025) with key advancements: (i) a deep neural network to parametrize high-dimensional non-linear ozone chemistry without the need for empirical linearization of atmospheric conditions, (ii) incorporation of water vapor, (iii) improved error characterization, and (iv) the application of a finer CTM to dynamically convert column retrievals into near-surface mixing ratios. Our PO3 sensitivity maps surpass traditional FNR-based assessments by quantifying sensitivity magnitudes – factoring in photolysis rates and water vapor – with greater spatial information. Our new product provides daily near-clear sky PO3 and sensitivity maps using bias-corrected OMI (2005–2019, 0.25° × 0.25°) and TROPOMI (2018–2023, 0.1° × 0.1°), with values aligning within 10 %. High PO3 rates (> 8 ppbv h−1) appear in urban and biomass-burning regions under strong photochemical activity, including during a heatwave in the northeastern U.S. Photolysis rates are the dominant factor dictating the seasonality of PO3 magnitudes and sensitivities. The stability and long-term records of OMI retrievals (2005–2019) enable us to provide the first global maps of PO3 linear trends showing a surge of > 30 % over China, the Middle East, and India, while a reduction in the eastern U.S., southern Europe, and several regions in Africa."

 Elevated background ozone (O3) poses significant challenges for regional air quality management. Understanding the vertical distribution of O3 and its precursors is critical, yet remains poorly characterized in Southwest China. This study presents the first comprehensive altitudinal gradient analysis (550, 1774, 2119 m  above sea level – a.s.l.) in the Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve, a remote high-altitude site on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Continuous measurements (March–August 2024) revealed a marked positive gradient in O3 (14.8 ± 15.2 ppb at mountain foot to 40.2 ± 14.7 ppb at mountaintop), contrasting with declining precursor concentrations. Random Forest–SHAP analysis identified relative humidity and NOx as dominant controls at the mountain foot, whereas temperature and reactive VOCs governed O3 variability aloft. Chemical box modeling (OBM-MCM v3.3.1) demonstrated net O3 destruction at mountain foot (−1.93 ppb h−1) due to NO titration, shifting to net production at mountainside (0.35 ppb h−1) and mountaintop (0.29 ppb h−1). While O3 formation remained NOx-limited across all sites, sensitivity to anthropogenic hydrocarbons increased with altitude (RIR: −0.12 mountain foot to 0.51 mountaintop). Transport analysis indicated O3 accumulation at mountain foot via regional transport, contrasting with mountainside and mountaintop, which function as net source regions. These findings necessitate altitude-specific O3 control: prioritizing NOx reduction at lower elevations while coordinating NOx and VOC controls at higher altitudes. Expanding high-altitude monitoring, especially in under-monitored areas like Southwest China, is crucial for characterizing regional background pollution. Future studies require vertical monitoring with improved models to assess transboundary impacts and changing emissions."

Turner;Diego Lange;Volker Wulfmeyer,Improved method for temporally interpolating radiosonde profiles in the convective boundary layer,"Many atmospheric science endeavors require temporally resolved profiles of temperature, humidity, and winds. Radiosondes are considered the gold standard for measuring these profiles, but the temporal resolution is frequently too coarse for many applications within the atmospheric boundary layer. This study proposes a new method using a normalized height grid in the temporal interpolation process that yields more accurate profiles in the convective boundary layer. 
 A significantly improved technique for temporally interpolating radiosonde (RS) profiles of potential temperature and water vapor mixing ratio in the planetary boundary layer during daytime is introduced. The key innovation of this technique is its operation on a height grid normalized with the planetary boundary layer height. This study utilized a three-month dataset of three-hourly soundings from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Facility's Southern Great Plains site. The technique was evaluated for convective boundary layer cases, with the necessary boundary layer height data obtained from a ground-based infrared spectrometer. A total of 79 comparisons were conducted between reference soundings and interpolated profiles that did and did not employ height normalization. The results demonstrated a substantial improvement in the representation of interpolated profiles using the new technique, characterized by enhanced correlation, improved amplitude representation, and reduced bias for potential temperature, as well as improved correlation and reduced bias for water vapor mixing ratio."

Brandt;Catherine Juéry;Vincent Blandin;Dominik Brunner;Gerrit Kuhlmann,Quantifying CH4 point source emissions with airborne remote sensing: first results from AVIRIS-4,"We tested a new airborne imaging instrument to detect and measure methane emissions. Flying over controlled test releases in France, we compared our measurements with known release rates. The instrument detected emissions as low as 5.5 kilograms per hour in good weather and 1.45 kilograms per hour in ideal conditions. Our results show that better wind information is crucial for accurate totals. Our new instrument is important for helping target methane leaks in energy and waste systems. 
 Atmospheric concentration of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, increased significantly since pre-industrial times, with anthropogenic emissions originating primarily from agriculture, fossil fuel sector and waste management. However, considerable uncertainties persist in the detection and quantification of anthropogenic CH4 emissions. In this study, we present first CH4 observations, plume detections and emission estimates from the new state-of-the-art Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer 4 (AVIRIS-4), which participated in a blind controlled release experiment in September 2024 in southern France. We used an albedo-corrected matched filter to retrieve CH4 maps from the spectral images and estimated CH4 emission with the Integrated Mass Enhancement (IME) and Cross-Sectional Flux (CSF) methods. Our results demonstrate that AVIRIS-4 can reliably detect emissions as low as 5.5 kg CH4 h−1 under good weather conditions at low flight altitudes (< 1500 m) and 1.45 kg CH4 h−1 under ideal conditions. These low-altitude detection limits are substantially lower than published detection limits for the predecessor instrument AVIRIS-NG, which were in the order of 10–16 kg CH4 h−1 under comparable conditions. While AVIRIS-4 provides highly accurate CH4 maps at < 0.5 m resolution, emission estimation is limited by the accuracy of the effective wind speed, whose uncertainty and natural variability contribute substantially to the overall uncertainty. Using wind speed at source height performs well for small releases (below 20 kg CH4 h−1) (rRMSE =1.065; rMBE =0.361) and overall (rRMSE =0.702; rMBE =−0.204). Using literature-derived effective wind speeds improves the apparent fit between estimated and reported CH4 emissions, but degrades performance both in overall agreement (rRMSE =2.098; rMBE =0.964) and for low-emission events (rRMSE =2.367; rMBE =1.711). Interestingly, the high spatial resolution makes it possible to retrieve the cast shadow of the CH4 plume, which can be used to estimate source and plume height, and could provide an approach for better constraining the height-dependency of the effective wind speed. On the bottom line, the controlled release experiment provides critical insights into the sensor's capabilities and guides further improvements to detect and quantify low intensity sources in the fossil fuel and waste management sectors, with implications for more accurate global greenhouse gas monitoring."

Traditional instruments only capture the average behavior of many particles, missing how individual ones grow. We developed a precise optical method that traps and measures single particles as humidity varies, accurately determining their dry size and water uptake. This versatile approach applies to diverse particle types and enhances understanding of their roles in air quality and climate systems. 
 Traditional hygroscopicity bulk measurements of aerosols using humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) are limited to population-averaged properties, potentially overlooking individual particle growth processes. Although aerosol optical tweezers enable single-particle measurements, no universal and accurate method exists to determine particle dry radius and hygroscopic growth factor (GF). Here, we develop a robust method using optical tweezers to quantify GF of individual particles accurately. Solution densities were accurately predicted via apparent molar volume, and refractive indices were predicted using the molar refraction method. By fitting particle radius and refractive index across multiple relative humidities under the conservation of solute mass, we retrieve dry particle size and hygroscopic growth curves. Application to typical aerosols, including ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, and sucrose, yields GF in excellent agreement with reported values and thermodynamic models, while extension to mixed-component particles also demonstrates broad applicability. This study provides the first accurate characterization of single-particle hygroscopic growth with optical tweezers, yielding a self-consistent set of physical parameters and a framework to test and refine thermodynamic models, while improving the representation of aerosol–radiation–cloud interactions in climate models."

The model integrates GLASS and MODIS remote sensing data, ERA5-Land reanalysis datasets, topographic data, CO2 concentration data as independent variables and in situ radiation and heat flux observations at 258 eddy covariance sites worldwide as dependent variables within a multivariate random forest technique to effectively learn the physics of energy conservation. The developed CoSEB-based datasets are strikingly advantageous in that [1] they are the first data-driven global datasets that satisfy both surface radiation balance and heat balance among the eight fluxes, as demonstrated by both the radiation imbalance ratio [RIR, defined as 100%×(SWIN-SWOUT+LWIN-LWOUT-Rn)/Rn] and energy imbalance ratio [EIR, defined as 100%×(Rn-G-LE-H)/Rn] of 0, [2] the radiation and heat fluxes are characterized by high accuracies, where (1) the RMSEs (R2) for daily estimates of SWIN, SWOUT, LWIN, LWOUT, Rn, LE, H and G from the CoSEB-based datasets at 44 independent test sites were 37.52 W m−2 (0.81), 14.20 W m−2 (0.42), 22.47 W m−2 (0.90), 13.78 W m−2 (0.95), 29.66 W m−2 (0.77), 30.87 W m−2 (0.60), 29.75 W m−2 (0.44) and 5.69 W m−2 (0.44), respectively, (2) the CoSEB-based datasets, in comparison to the mainstream products/datasets (i.e. GLASS, BESS-Rad, BESSV2.0, FLUXCOM, MOD16A2, PML_V2 and ETMonitor) that generally separately estimated subsets of the eight flux components, better agreed with the in situ observations. Our developed datasets hold significant potential for application across diverse fields such as agriculture, forestry, hydrology, meteorology, ecology, and environmental science, which can facilitate comprehensive studies on the variability, impacts, responses, adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures of global and regional land surface radiation and heat fluxes under the influences of climate change and human activities.

The gridded product provide us a better view of contemporary mean status of the Southern Ocean and Antarctic shelf seas and help models to better reference the prediction of the future climate. 
 A compilation of in situ temperature and salinity profiles south of 45° S is assembled, drawing from multiple data centers and sensor sources. This database is then used to create a new Southern Ocean climatology, adopting an interpolation scheme that takes into account ocean depth and mean ocean dynamics, influenced by methods developed for the Southern Ocean Atlas. This interpolation scheme is designed to consider along flow spatial coherency and the distinct dynamic regimes between Antarctic shelf seas and the Southern Ocean. Initial exploration of the profile compilation investigates the type of variability timescales one could reasonably start to analyze in different sectors around Antarctica. A comparison between the climatology product and the World Ocean Atlas climatology, the most used product to date, indicates that the OCEAN ICE climatology provides significant improvements in Antarctic shelf seas, including a more detailed representation of the unique water masses they host. The profile compilation is available in NetCDF format with the SEANOE database at https://doi.org/10.17882/99787, and the climatology product is available at https://doi.org/10.17882/103946.

This new dataset is shown to improve mesoscale quality and consistency, particularly over coastal and polar areas, as well as the long-term stability for climate research. 
 Since the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992, more than 15 satellite altimetry missions have gathered measurements of ocean surface topography. These observations contributed to significant advancements in our understanding of ocean dynamics in the open ocean, coastal and polar areas and at scales ranging from 10 km and a few days to global averages over decades.

This study aimed to elucidate the interaction between HBQs and DNA, which may represent a critical initial molecular event in the adverse outcome pathway toward carcinogenesis. By combining high- and low-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), we developed a highly selective and sensitive analytical strategy integrating pentose neutral loss and information-dependent acquisition to characterize trace-level HBQ-DNA adducts in complex biological matrices. Deoxyguanosine (dG) was identified as the primary target of HBQs, and in vitro reaction revealed 16 mono-, di-, and trihalogenated 1:1 and 2:1 (mol:mol) adducts, including HBQ-dG, HHQ-dG, HPH-dG, and HBQ-HPH-dG (HHQ and HPH denoted halohydroquinone and halophenol, respectively). The stepwise formation involved HBQ-HHQ interconversion, cyclization of OH or halogen in HBQ with N1 and N2 in dG, and ether bond formation between HBQ and HPH. Four adducts were identified in reaction with calf thymus DNA, and in particular, 1-Cl-3-OH-PH-6,5-N1,N2-dG was identified in human urothelial cells SV-HUC-1.

We evaluated the molecule-to-population responses of the zooplankton Brachionus asplanchnoidis to leachate from retired 18650 cells across single-generation exposure, postexposure recovery, and multigenerational propagation and tested whether monosodium glutamate (MSG) accelerates recovery. Rotifers were exposed to 5% (volume/volume, v/v) leachate and assessed for morphological, feeding, life-history, population, metabolomic, biochemical, and gene-expression end points. Chemical profiling confirmed elevated Li, Fe, Al, Co, Ni, and Mn above seawater background. Leachate suppressed growth and feeding within and across generations, and poststress recovery was asynchronous, with feeding rebounding faster than body size and life-history traits. In multigenerational assays, the exposure lineage collapsed by F4, whereas recovery lineages showed progressive improvement, approaching control levels by ∼F6 in the transgenerational lineage and by ∼F4 with MSG supplementation. Metabolomics revealed 189 differential metabolites and distinct exposure–recovery signatures centered on amino acid and energy metabolism. Gene expression supported metallothionein-mediated detoxification under the measured metal burden. By integrating short- and long-term perspectives, this study demonstrates multilevel toxicity, incomplete and phased recovery, and the potential of targeted nutritional support to enhance resilience and poststress performance, informing mixture-aware environmental risk assessment of LIB leachate."

Moving beyond conventional metal–CO2 interaction strategies, we demonstrate a powerful alternative pathway through atomic-level engineering of zeolite oxygen electronic states. Incorporating Ce into the mordenite (MOR) framework generates electron-rich lattice oxygens and spatially polarized Oδ−–Ceδ+–Oδ− domains within the channels. These unique electronic features endow the resulting Ce-MOR with exceptional CO2 uptake, even at high Si/Al ratios (∼8). Spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that strong Ce 4f–O 2p orbital coupling redistributes electron density, creating robust trapping sites. The electron-rich Oδ− atoms serve as primary binding centers, synergizing with adjacent Ceδ+ to enable dual CO2 adsorption pathways: Cδ+(CO2)···Oδ− (framework) and Oδ−(CO2)···Ceδ+. Furthermore, by assembling Ce-MOR crystals into a binder-free monolith, we achieve enhanced mass transport and mechanical stability, translating the intrinsic adsorption advantages of Ce-MOR into superior dynamic CO2 capture performance under realistic flow conditions. This work offers a novel perspective on designing practical, high-efficiency physisorbents by tailoring electron-rich anionic centers and integrating them into scalable monolithic architectures."

Acidic conditions maintained by nitrification can enhance digestion efficiency, but at short hydraulic retention time (HRT), nitrifiers are washed out. Here, we utilized a biofilm-based solution to retain nitrifiers and produce in situ free nitrous acid (HNO2) to expedite WAS stabilization and reduce pH. Two laboratory-scale sludge digesters were operated for over one year to evaluate this approach. This process reduced pathogen levels to well below the Class A biosolids standard within an extraordinarily short HRT of 1.75 days. Furthermore, it achieved a high volatile solids (VS) reduction rate of 0.87 ± 0.13 kg/m3/d. Model-based analysis indicated the biofilm-based digester achieved both a higher hydrolysis rate (k) (0.58 ± 0.07 d–1 vs 0.51 ± 0.13 d–1) and a greater extent of VS degradability (fd) (31 ± 2% vs 21 ± 2%) compared to the suspended sludge digester. Microbial community analysis revealed that biofilms enriched ammonia oxidizers and acid-tolerant heterotrophs, underpinning enhanced HNO2 production and sludge degradation. Overall, this process provides a promising sludge management strategy for small-scale WWTPs."

We assessed associations between water interruptions and various outcomes. Among 237 households in Malawi, we conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire and tested drinking water for generic and cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli (CREC). Water interruptions in the past month were reported by 32.5% of households; interruptions were unpredictable and more common in piped supplies. Households with interruptions were 3−5 times more likely to be water-insecure, skip laundry and handwashing after handling animal feces (p-values < 0.05). Most water samples came from storage, and 65.7% harbored E. coli and 8.4% harbored CREC; households with vs without interruptions had similar fecal contamination. Children <5 years experiencing interruptions had increased caregiver-defined diarrhea (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.85, 1.02−3.37) and ARI with fever (PR = 1.98, 1.09−3.57). Rare (1−2/month) interruptions were associated with diarrhea and antibiotic use; frequent (≥3/month) or long (above-median duration) interruptions with ARI. Frequent or short interruptions were associated with stress. Our findings highlight respiratory risks from water interruptions and suggest that interruption frequency and duration may influence enteric vs respiratory pathogen transmission through distinct mechanisms.

Previous research has linked noise to emotional or behavioral problems in children; however, the association between noise and developmental delays remains unclear. To examine this association, a total of 12,130 children aged 3 to 5.5 years were included from 226 kindergartens in Shanghai, China. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Chinese version of the Ages & Stages Questionnaires-Third Edition, and individual residential noise exposure (LAeq, 40 min) was estimated using a land-use regression model. Higher noise exposure was associated with lower performance in communication, motor, and problem-solving domains. Specifically, each interquartile range [4 dB(A)] increase in noise exposure was significantly associated with a decrease in gross motor scores (0.25, 95% CI, 0.04–0.47) and an increase in the suspected developmental delay (SDD) odds (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.15) and domain-specific delays, particularly in communication (OR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.27) and gross motor (OR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03–1.19).

However, PFOS degradation pathways and underlying mechanisms under smoldering reductive conditions remain unclear. In this study, PFOS smoldering degradation pathways and relative bond cleavage mechanisms were deduced from lab-scale byproduct profiles and supported by reactive force field simulations and quantum-chemical calculations. Smoldering self-sustained at calorific value of 0.79 MJ/kg and air Darcy velocity of 1.5–2.5 cm/s. The removal rate of PFOS reached 98.1%, with only ∼50% energy consumption compared with that of conventional incineration under equivalent degradation conditions. Investigations revealed distinct degradation pathways in smoldering compared with traditional approaches: in a CO atmosphere, early C–C bond scission and CO-coupled sulfur transformation were predicted (potentially evolving toward COS). This pathway played a dominant role in PFOS degradation, providing more efficient sulfur-group transformation, less toxic byproducts, and better compatibility with oxygen-limited conditions. Pilot-scale experiments further validated the feasibility for field applications, achieving 98.6% PFOS removal. These findings provide mechanistic insights into improved smoldering-based PFASs remediation under reductive conditions and optimization of treatment strategies toward higher efficiency and environmental safety."

Here, we demonstrate that aged polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) unexpectedly mitigate cadmium [Cd(II)]-induced acute cytotoxicity in osteoblasts, suggesting a modulatory role beyond passive transport. Aged PS-NPs effectively adsorb Cd(II) via electrostatic and coordination interactions, forming larger aggregates that significantly limit cellular uptake compared to free Cd(II). This mitigating effect was further associated with restricted Cd(II) release, altered subcellular trafficking, and limited mitochondrial penetration, as revealed by super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). In addition, molecular-level analyses demonstrated that aged PS-NPs impaired Cd(II) binding to biomolecules. Collectively, these mechanisms reduced Cd(II) bioavailability. Quantitatively, aged PS-NPs reduced intracellular free Cd(II) by ∼14–29% and attenuated cytotoxic responses by ∼15–33% with respect to oxidative stress, membrane damage, and apoptosis during 24 h of acute co-exposure. Our findings reveal an unexpected mitigating role of aged nanoplastics in metal toxicity, challenging their conventional view as merely passive carriers.

However, whether and how probiotics interact with PFBS to maintain the host’s endocrine equilibrium are unknown. Herein, juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio) were chronically exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of PFBS during the critical window of gonadal differentiation and maturation (from 21 days postfertilization (dpf) until 150 dpf), with or without dietary supplementation of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus. At 35 dpf, probiotics robustly acted to alleviate PFBS body burden and regulate the toxic fingerprints of PFBS on the sex ratio, estrogen hormones, sex differentiating genes, and estrobolome dynamics. In mature adults, PFBS induced antiestrogenic effects in females, thus forming a male-biased population, accompanied by oogenesis blockade, reduced fecundity, and offspring developmental defects. However, these adverse effects were efficiently counteracted by probiotic supplementation, which was attributed to the holistic activation of the reproductive axis and marked increase of estrogen concentrations. In the gut microenvironment, probiotics mitigated the PFBS-induced disturbance of estrogen-metabolizing bacteria, β-glucuronidase enzyme activity, and critical metabolites along the pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathway, thus directing estrogen gut-liver recycling. Overall, our findings highlight the far-reaching implications of probiotics beyond the gut to mitigate endocrine disrupting effects, suggesting a health intervention strategy based on gut estrobolome remediation."

However, the highly diverse molecular composition of wastewater, arising from various emission sources, presents a major challenge to deciphering the underlying biochemical reactions. Herein, nontargeted analysis and paired mass distance (PMD) analysis were conducted in paired influent–effluent samples from 11 wastewater treatment plants to elucidate contaminant diversity and transformation reactions across different treatment processes. In total, 418 structural subclasses of contaminants were classified, among which amino acids, peptides, and analogues (AAPAs) were the most common. Although the total number of features, subclasses, and overall abundance decreased in effluent samples, chemical diversity did not show a consistent reduction. This finding was primarily due to the removal of contaminants such as AAPAs and the persistence of aromatic compounds such as benzenoids. Transformation reactions were highly conserved across biological processes, with methylation and demethylation occurring the most frequently. High-frequency PMDs were strongly associated with carbon-related transformations, which substantially altered the polarity of transformation products. Furthermore, transformation reactions were characterized by small mass shifts and intrastructural reactions, indicating that most contaminants did not undergo extensive structural transformations. This study provides insight into common patterns of contaminant removal across wastewater treatment processes, benefiting transformation product prediction and wastewater treatment process optimization."

Lithium titanate (LTO) is structurally robust and chemically selective yet remains electrochemically inactive under aqueous conditions. In contrast, manganese-based spinels exhibit strong redox activity but suffer from structural degradation. Here, we report a site-selective doping strategy that integrates the strengths of both material classes by incorporating Mn into the spinel framework of LTO. Crystallographic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical analyses reveal that Mn substitution of specific lattice sites modulates both Li+ transport pathways and redox-active centers, enabling enhanced intercalation kinetics and electronic conductivity without compromising the structural integrity of the crystal lattice. The optimized electrode material (H1.33Ti1.17Mn0.5O4) achieves a record Li+ adsorption capacity of 43.58 mg/g at 350 ppm of Li+ with high selectivity and minimal capacity loss after repeated cycling with real salt lake brine.

The total annualized expenditures (including capital and operating) are 1.41–1.87 (5th to 95th percentiles) and 1.85–2.45 USD·cap–1·day–1 for PMD and SCWO, respectively, placing both at the high end of global centralized treatment prices.

Poor solid–liquid separation disproportionately increases costs and GHG emissions for SCWO relative to PMD. In the short term, optimizing a few levers─number of users, flush water volume, and the detailed design of the SCWO unit─can significantly reduce cost and emissions. In the long term, operating at maximum efficiency reduces both cost and emissions by approximately 70%. Deployment in locations with low wage, low-carbon electricity, low price levels, and large household sizes offers the greatest potential, positioning HRTs as viable advanced decentralized sanitation options in specialized settings."

However, inherent challenges exist in capturing the in situ metabolic activity of phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) due to intrinsic cultivation biases and the disconnect between bulk metagenomic profiles and the functions of viable cells. Furthermore, a lack of research into the coupling  the phenotypic activity and adaptive genetic strategies of PSB in heterogeneous sedimentary environments  has led to limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying endogenous phosphorus release. Here,  using single-cell Raman spectroscopy coupled with deuterium oxide labeling (Raman-D2O), distinct in situ phosphorus-solubilizing activities of PSB inhabiting eutrophic, mesotrophic, and oligotrophic sediments were quantified. Inorganic PSB dominated in all sediment types but exhibited the highest activity in nutrient-rich eutrophic sites. Their activities correlated strongly with phosphorus speciation and release fluxes at the sediment–water interface of their habits. In contrast, organic PSB prevailed in oligotrophic sediments. Raman-activated cell sorting conbined with metagenomic sequencing uncovered that low-abundance taxa (e.g., Bacillus and Acinetobacter ) acted as disproportionate drivers of phosphorus mobilization. PSB from eutrophic sediments were enriched in genes encoding phosphatases and organic acid hydrolysis pathways, whereas their oligotrophic counterparts  favored genes related to high-affinity transporters and polyphosphate storage. These findings elucidate how nutrient regimes shape PSB metabolic traits, advancing mechanistic insights into microbial phosphorus dynamics in aquatic ecosystems and providing a theoretical basis for optimizing lake management strategies to mitigate endogenous pollutant-driven eutrophication risks."

Using three low-salt-rejection membranes, including a highly “leaky” membrane prepared by controlled chlorination, we conducted experiments with NaCl solutions of up to 3.64 M to measure water flux, salt rejection, and salinity-dependent salt permeability. With only three intrinsic membrane parameters, the SF-AA accurately captures the dependence of salt transport on both feed concentration and permeate flux, substantially outperforming the conventional model.

PFOS and undecanedioic acid were associated with increased odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in logistic regression models adjusted for maternal age and race/ethnicity. We observed associations between four level 2 chemicals and GDM, and eight were associated with gestational hypertension. Exposure levels varied significantly by education, race/ethnicity, and nativity, with higher PFOS observed in participants with higher educational attainment and in non-Hispanic White groups. Our findings highlight novel chemical exposures and their associations with pregnancy complications, raising concerns about gaps in the monitoring of plastic-related chemicals and their potential impacts on maternal health."

Pan,A Machine Learning‐Based Dynamic SST Index for Long‐Lead Malaria Prediction in the Peruvian Amazon,"Malaria imposes a major health burden in the Peruvian Amazon, and its early warning is essential for effective disease prevention. The tropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability, fundamentally shaping the global weather patterns, may also alter malaria transmission and potentially improve its long‐lead predictability. In this study, we propose a machine learning‐based methodology that leverages comprehensive tropical SST variability for malaria prediction in the Peruvian Amazon. First, we demonstrate that significant correlations broadly exist between tropical SST anomalies and Peruvian malaria occurrence across different seasons and time lags, confirming the potential predictability from the tropical ocean. Then, we apply the self‐organizing map to synthesize the spatiotemporally varying SST‐malaria relationship and identify a unique dynamic SST index for Peruvian malaria. The dynamic SST index provides better performance (higher correlation coefficients and lower root mean square errors) in the generalized linear model, compared to the traditional El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index, with lead times exceeding 3 months. Furthermore, the dynamic SST index captures the evolution of the ENSO life cycle from its precursor climate mode (Pacific Meridional Mode) and appears to influence Peruvian malaria by altering the local near‐surface air temperature and specific humidity. Such underlying mechanisms provide the physically plausible basis for the long‐lead predictability of Peruvian malaria using a machine learning‐based remote predictor. Last but not least, we provide open‐source code for broad applications in linking tropical SST variability and vector‐borne disease transmission, or other climate‐sensitive socioeconomic issues."

Groundwater chemistry can contribute to lead leaching from water supply pipes due to factors such as pH and mineral content that influence corrosion. Lead exposure disproportionately affects children from low‐income neighborhoods.

It blends flexibility with rigidity, offers high sensitivity and wide range, withstands extreme heat and cold, with promise for integration in spacesuits. 
 Striking a balance between sensitivity and detection range while ensuring stability under extreme temperatures remains a formidable challenge in the design of flexible pressure sensors. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the multi-gradient architectures of nature and propose a bottom-up self-assembly strategy. By leveraging a meticulously orchestrated multi-step approach that encompasses electrospinning, sequential freezing, and thermal imidization, we successfully fabricate a polyimide nanofiber/carbon nanotube dual-gradient aerogel with a dynamic stiffness transition from flexible to rigid states. Experimental results highlight notable properties of the dual-gradient aerogel, which exhibits an ultralow density (0.023 g cm−3), efficient thermal insulation (28 mW m−1 K−1), and reliable compressibility and fatigue resistance. Moreover, it establishes a favorable equilibrium between sensitivity (156 MPa−1) and an extensive detection range (223 kPa). Notably, the combination of thermal resilience (−196 °C to 533.30 °C) and mechanical stability enables performance that is comparable to, or in some aspects surpasses, that of conventional flexible sensing materials. This dual-gradient aerogel provides both effective thermal insulation and high-precision physiological monitoring under extreme conditions, offering integrated thermal protection and real-time astronaut health assessment in spacesuits.

 Glasses linked by molecular building blocks are emerging materials promising for combining the processability of glasses and designability of reticular frameworks. Achieving modular chemical space construction is key to promoting structural diversity for these glasses, which requires systematically understanding their structures and properties. Herein, we combine rheological, thermal, compositional and total scattering techniques to study glasses and liquids based on titanium, zirconium and boron nodes, multi-dentate alcohol linkers and monodentate alcohol modulators and elucidate their structure-property relationships. With decreasing modulator, the node-linker-modulator series show increased connectivity characterized by increased viscosity and diminished heat capacity jump at glass transition, eventually giving glassy coordinative networks. By systematically tuning their compositions, we show the glass transition temperatures of these materials are affected by the interplay between non-covalent interactions and covalent network formation. The modular designability in alkoxide-based glasses is exploited for synthesizing fluorescent molecular network-forming glasses with high quantum yield, which can be integrated into electroluminescent devices. The current development represents an important expansion of reticular chemistry into the regime of glassy materials.

 Coupling of ribosomal translation with cotranslational protein folding is essential for cellular homeostasis. In eukaryotes, Hsp70 and its J-domain cochaperone, the heterodimeric ribosome-associated complex (RAC), are central to this process; however, mechanistic insights into the coordination of Hsp70 function with translation remain limited. Here, we present two cryo-EM structures of the ribosome-bound yeast Hsp70 Ssb, identifying Rpl25/uL23 as the ribosomal binding site and revealing its interaction with a model nascent chain. Together with detailed biochemical and mutational analyses, these structures enable us to delineate the intricate RAC-dependent cycle, which positions the substrate binding domain of Ssb-ATP close to the tunnel exit to receive nascent chains. This arrangement allows Ssb to undergo substantial conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis without steric clashes with the ribosome, while the substrate binding domain of Ssb, now anchored by the tightly bound nascent chain, remains close to the tunnel exit.

Here, the authors show that DNA end configurations, particularly short microhomologies, dictate synaptic complex formation and can bypass XLF to promote close end joining. 
 Synapsis, the physical bridging of two broken DNA ends, is a critical step in non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ), the primary pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vertebrates. While NHEJ synapsis has been well characterized using blunt-ended DNA, how diverse DNA end configurations influence synaptic complex formation remains much less clear. Here, using single-molecule FRET, we show that end configurations play a decisive role in synapsis pathway choice, with end pairing compensating for XLF in facilitating synaptic complex transitions. Notably, 3-nucleotide (nt) microhomology at DNA ends significantly enhances close synaptic (CS) complex formation mediated by Ku70-Ku80 (Ku) and XRCC4-Ligase IV (X4L4), even in the absence of XLF. Although XLF is nonessential for synapsis with 3-nt microhomology, it further promotes CS formation when present. The FRET analysis reveals that the single-stranded and double-stranded junctions of the DNA ends are in close contact within the primary CS complex, while the overhangs flip out of the duplex, potentially stabilizing the complex. These findings underscore the pivotal role of DNA end configurations in regulating synapsis and their broader implications for NHEJ repair efficiency and fidelity. DNA double-strand breaks are primarily repaired by non-homologous end joining, which requires synapsis of broken DNA ends.

Here, the authors report that two mutations in the viral polymerase helped the virus to quickly adapt to cattle. Mutations increased the polymerase activity and made the virus better at replicating in human cells. 
 In 2024, an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza was detected in dairy cattle in the USA resulting in spillbacks into poultry, wild birds and other mammals including humans. Here, we present molecular and virological evidence that the cattle B3.13 genotype H5N1 viruses rapidly accumulated adaptations in polymerase genes that enabled better replication in bovine cells and tissues, as well as cells of other mammals including humans. We find evidence of several mammalian adaptations in cattle including PB2 M631L, which is found in all cattle sequences, and PA K497R, which is found in the majority. Structurally, PB2 M631L maps to the polymerase-ANP32 interface, an essential host factor for viral genome replication. We show that this mutation adapts the polymerase to better interact with bovine ANP32 proteins, particularly ANP32A, and thereby enhances virus replication in bovine mammary systems and primary human airway cultures. We show that ongoing evolution in the PB2 gene, including E627K and a convergently arising D740N substitution, further increase polymerase activity and virus replication in a range of mammalian cells. Thus, circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle allows virus adaption improving replicative ability in cattle and poses a continued risk of zoonotic spillover. Avian influenza jumped from wild birds into dairy cattle. Here, the authors report that two mutations in the viral polymerase helped the virus to quickly adapt to cattle.

 The hole-electron resonance in two-dimensional WTe2 dynamically screens the built-in electric field, disrupting the scattering equilibrium constraints of conventional electron transport. Here, we propose utilizing the hole-electron resonance to achieve Coulomb force-unconstrained spin angular momentum transfer across the WTe2/Fe3GaTe2 interface, offering a novel platform for exploring unconventional spin transport phenomena. A clear signature of this mechanism is the observation of an unusual anisotropic magnetoresistance of 289%, which far exceeds conventional spin Hall magnetoresistance and cannot be explained by standard spin absorption or scattering models. Its angular profile deviates from the simple cosine-squared form but realigns after accounting for magnetization and field orientation, reflecting the interplay between hole-electron resonance and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, chiral transverse transport with distinct symmetry transitions emerges within the hole-active temperature regime, originating from interfacial symmetry breaking and the inhomogeneous spin-orbital coupling. These findings highlight the essential roles of both electrons and holes in spin transport.

Here, authors show that higher temperatures activate numerous noncanonical PAMs, enabling a versatile one-pot platform that improves sensitivity, specificity, and rapid on-site pathogen detection. 
 The canonical PAM site TTTV (where V = A, G, or C) is widely used in the design of CRISPR-Cas12a systems for both genome editing and diagnostic applications. Although several non-canonical protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAM) have been identified, they generally exhibit weak Cas12a cleavage activity. In this study, we find that increasing the reaction temperature to 45 °C or higher allows the identification of numerous non-canonical PAMs with trans-cleavage activity comparable to that of canonical PAMs, while displaying only weak cis-cleavage activity. Moreover, we observe that combining these non-canonical PAMs with elevated temperatures significantly enhances the Cas12a system’s ability to discriminate highly similar sequences. Based on these findings, we develop a non-canonical PAM-mediated, poikilothermal, one-pot CRISPR-Cas12a detection platform (POP-CRISPR), which demonstrates substantial improvements in sensitivity, specificity, speed, and target adaptability for nucleic acid detection compared to existing methods. These advantages are validated through the reliable detection of clinical samples, including those of Human papillomavirus (HPV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), and its drug-resistant strains. Additionally, we show that POP-CRISPR enables rapid, on-site pathogen detection within 20 min, using a fast sample processing protocol and a miniaturized detection device.

Here authors show that non-cholinergic neurons in rodent basal forebrain link sensory stimuli with motivational states and experience-driven plasticity. 
 Sensory perception is shaped by experience, giving stimuli behavioral significance. Basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons in mice, which are crucial for arousal and motivation, also regulate sensory processing. Within BF nuclei, glutamatergic (vGlut2BF) neurons receive cholinergic input and modulate behaviors, but their roles in encoding sensory significance remain unclear. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we found that vGlut2BF neurons initially poorly encoded odor identity. However, their response to conditioned odors increased following associative learning, and their population activity more distinctly encoded paired stimuli, reflecting emergent value representation. Furthermore, pairing stimulation or inhibition of vGlut2BF neurons with specific odors altered odor preferences, suggesting that appropriately timed vGlut2BF neuronal activity is sufficient to influence valence assignment. Our findings reveal that vGlut2BF neurons transform sensory input into motivationally significant stimuli, positioning the BF as a key hub for linking sensory processing with motivational states and experience-driven plasticity. Neural mechanisms underlying motivation-driven behaviors are not fully understood. Here authors show that non-cholinergic neurons in rodent basal forebrain link sensory stimuli with motivational states and experience-driven plasticity."

This study quantifies the inequality in household material footprints (MFs) using detailed global expenditure data from 168 countries, linked with a multiregional input–output approach. Results reveal stark inequalities: the top 10% consumers contribute 36% of global total household MFs, while the bottom 50% of consumers account for merely 18%. Inequality is especially pronounced in non-renewable resources such as metals and fossil fuels. Furthermore, elasticity analysis reveals a recoupling of resource use with high consumption, challenging the notion of absolute decoupling. These findings suggest that current sustainability policies about resource focusing on national efficiency gains may fall short without addressing the material-intensive lifestyles of the affluent. Targeting overconsumption at the top could reduce ecological overshoot and create space for sustainable development and material sufficiency for the global majority. Global material use is rising unsustainably, but its distribution across individuals remains unclear. A study now reveals deep inequality in household material footprints, especially for non-renewable resources, and suggests that curbing overconsumption among the wealthy is key to sustainability."

 In this study, the variations in near-surface wind speed (SWS) across China were analysed using 55 years of observational data from 2044 meteorological stations spanning 1970–2024. The results indicate that the SWS in China experienced a persistent decline from 1970 to 2004, then remained constant from 2005 to 2014 and shifted to recovery after 2015. The seasonal and spatial analyses confirmed that the slowdown period occurred nearly nationwide, whereas the apparent recovery displayed a strong spatial heterogeneity. On the basis of long-term station records and metadata from China, station-by-station analysis revealed that SWS records are strongly influenced by widespread relocations; 1237 stations (60.5% of the total stations) with SWS discontinuities were related to relocations, leading to an overestimation of the so-called “recovery phase” at national and regional scales. This emphasized the importance of homogenization to ensure the reliability of the SWS dataset. Afterwards, the SWS breakpoints were detected and adjusted. After homogenization, the SWS displayed slight but significantly negative trends (–‍0.06 m s⁻¹ per decade) after 2005. Representative non-relocated stations were used to validate the homogenized results, and revealed that the homogenized series accurately captured more robust signal from non-relocated stations, which confirmed the consistent declining trends across China and further implied the effect of station relocation. Notably, compared with the original records, the reduction in the homogenized SWS ranged from 3% to 11% among the subregions. This could substantially impact on the assessment of wind energy resources and requires careful attention."

 Over the past four decades, global tropical cyclogenesis (TCG) frequency has exhibited no trend related to strong interannual variability and uneven regional TCG trends, despite pronounced global sea surface temperature (SST) increases. This study offers new evidence explaining the disparity between the global TCG trend and global warming. Here we show that just three global tropics-wide SST patterns can account for TCG interannual variability in most global ocean areas where TCG is climatologically active. We further find that the warming mode of tropical SSTs explains 77% of global ocean areas observed with significant TCG trends, with the strongest influence in the tropics with robust observed TCG trends. These warming-related TCG trends are associated with a reorganization of the Pacific and Atlantic Walker circulations, which modulates environmental conditions governing regional TCG. These findings reveal how global warming influences regional TCG in an uneven manner, consistent with the mechanisms underpinning interannual variability."

Miller,Modulation of tropical cyclone intensity by current–wind interaction,"Modulation of tropical cyclone intensity by current–wind interaction 
 Current–wind interaction modulates air–sea momentum and turbulent heat fluxes, which are critical in the energy cycle of tropical cyclones (TCs). However, the effects of the surface currents on air–sea exchange under TCs have remained unclear. Here, using an atmosphere–ocean coupled model, we investigate the role of current–wind interaction in determining TC intensity. Surface currents generally align with surface winds. Accounting for the current–wind interaction, the alignment reduces both the air–sea turbulent heat flux and momentum flux (average 1.0% and 2.5%), which serve as the energy source and sink of TCs, respectively. The reduction in the energy source (sink) decreases (increases) the TC growth −1.9% (+1.3%) on average and up to −13.7% (+11.1%). For simulations extending beyond the seasonal scale, the accumulated impacts of current–wind interaction alter TC genesis, affecting surface wind speed and sea surface temperature during the TC season. These findings reveal an important feedback mechanism associated with TCs driven by the current–wind interaction."

 Accurate and efficient climate simulations are crucial for understanding Earth’s evolving climate. However, current general circulation models (GCMs) face challenges in capturing unresolved physical processes, such as cloud and convection. A common solution is to adopt cloud-resolving models, which provide more accurate results than the standard subgrid parametrization schemes typically used in GCMs. However, cloud-resolving models, also referred to as super parametrizations, remain computationally prohibitive. Hybrid modeling, which integrates deep learning with equation-based GCMs, offers a promising alternative but often struggles with long-term stability and accuracy issues. In this work, we find that water vapor oversaturation during condensation is a key factor compromising the stability of hybrid models. To address this, we introduce CondensNet, a novel neural network architecture that embeds a self-adaptive physical constraint to correct unphysical condensation processes. CondensNet effectively mitigates water vapor oversaturation, enhancing simulation stability while maintaining accuracy and improving computational efficiency compared to super-parametrization schemes. We integrate CondensNet into a GCM to form PCNN-GCM (Physics-Constrained Neural Network GCM), a hybrid deep learning framework designed for long-term stable climate simulations in real-world conditions, including ocean and land. PCNN-GCM represents a significant milestone in hybrid climate modeling, as it shows a novel way to incorporate physical constraints adaptively, paving the way for accurate, lightweight, and stable long-term climate simulations."

 Extreme precipitation (EP) is a major climate risk, yet its projections remain uncertain due to the combined influence of thermodynamic (TH) and dynamic (DY) processes. Using multi-model simulations under three emission scenarios, we separate TH and DY contributions to the annual maximum 1-day precipitation (Rx1Day) and quantify their uncertainties. TH consistently intensifies extremes with warming, while DY strongly modulates their magnitude and direction. DY processes dominate Rx1Day uncertainty, with internal variability within DY emerging as the leading contributor. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis shows that the forced signal emerges more clearly for TH than DY, where chaotic variability fundamentally limits predictability. The strongest intensification occurs in equatorial regions, raising equity concerns for vulnerable populations. These results demonstrate that DY internal variability is the primary driver of EP uncertainty, highlighting limits to long-term predictability and the importance of properly representing natural dynamical fluctuations in future projections."

 Aerosol semi-direct effects represent one of the least understood yet important pathways of aerosol interactions. These effects occur when absorbing aerosols rapidly adjust Earth’s radiative budget through modifications of thermodynamic structures that influence cloud cover. Over the Atlantic Ocean, where two primary radiation-absorbing aerosols (smoke and dust) dominate above clouds, the mechanisms by which aerosol-layer properties affect underlying low-level cloud-top radiative cooling—a critical parameter controlling cloudiness—remain unclear. Using ten years of satellite-derived aerosol, cloud, and radiative flux observations, combined with radiative-transfer simulations, we find that dust and smoke layers induce longwave-dominated warming responses that weaken the mean radiative cooling at low-level cloud tops. However, the pathways of this warming response differ, resulting in dust layers impacting cloud-top cooling about ten times more than smoke layers. Whereas dust properties dominate dust-induced warming responses through direct interactions in longwave, smoke-induced warming responses involve enhanced smoke-layer moisture that induces longwave radiation, opposing the impacts of smoke properties at cloud tops. This weakened cloud-top cooling response reduces low-level cloudiness by approximately 1.21% and 0.28% for dust and smoke, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for longwave-mediated processes beyond traditional shortwave-dominated mechanisms in estimates of aerosol semi-direct effects.

 Ocean acidification caused by climate change drives a spectrum of ecological impacts on the marine environment, while also posing a lurking threat to the traces of human history lying on seabeds. We present a quantitative assessment of the climate change risk to underwater cultural heritage, focusing on the vulnerability of historical stone materials to shifting ocean pH levels. We monitored the amount and rate of stone surface material loss and textural alteration triggered by natural processes of mineral dissolution and biodeterioration in submarine settings, combining field and laboratory experimentations with climate models. Stone deterioration has been minimal in pre-industrial and present times; however, escalating anthropogenic emissions might lead to an exponential surge in vulnerability, with irreversible decay processes accelerating in the next decades and centuries, constrained by material properties and shifting biofouling dynamics. Ocean acidification will dramatically challenge the protection of underwater cultural heritage, demanding urgent preservation and adaptation policies.

 Ocean oxygen minimum zones have expanded since the mid-20th century, yet their future remains uncertain. Previous studies show that the eastern tropical North Pacific was well oxygenated during the warm Miocene Climatic Optimum (17.0–14.8 Ma), suggesting better oxygenation under climatic warming. To explore whether this response was global, we reconstruct Miocene oxygenation in the second largest oxygen minimum zone, the Arabian Sea. Trace elements and nitrogen isotopes in planktonic foraminifera show that the Arabian Sea was also better oxygenated during the Miocene Climatic Optimum than today. However, deoxygenation history and establishment of a true oxygen deficient zone following the Miocene cooling lagged in the Arabian Sea, indicating the important role of regional oceanographic processes like proto-monsoon or Tethys outflow. Our study supports future projections of deoxygenation reversals in both oxygen minimum zones, but with more complexity in the Arabian Sea due to competing changes in monsoonal upwelling and influx from marginal seas.

 The inland basins of western China are home to the world’s earliest definition of yardangs, which are streamlined, wind-sculpted landforms. The Qaidam Basin in northwestern China hosts one of the largest yardang fields on Earth, which has been regarded as the most Mars-analogue. However, basin-scale research on the timing and forcing mechanism of yardang formation in the Qaidam Basin remains lacking.

Our results indicate that yardang development in the Qaidam Basin commenced around 0.8 million years ago, starting in the northwest and gradually expanding southeast around 0.5−0.3 million years ago. This stepwise expansion of yardangs correlated well with the remarkable growth of Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet, which intensified the Siberian High and enhanced cold, dry prevailing winds in the region.

 Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) have experienced a steep population decline globally, extirpated from 91% of their historical range, including Saudi Arabia. Information about cheetahs’ historic range remains scarce throughout much of its former habitat. A serendipitous discovery of seven naturally mummified cheetahs in several caves along with skeletal remains of 54 cheetahs, and their putative prey, in Saudi Arabia provided a valuable opportunity to elucidate the evolutionary history of cheetahs in their former range. We applied paleochronological dating to establish temporal context, genomic sequencing to infer subspecies present during different time periods, and radiographic analysis to determine age classes. The mummified cheetahs showed 14C calibrated ages dated 4223 ± 40 years BP to 127 ± 40 years BP. Full genome sequences of the mummified cheetahs showed that only the youngest individual clustered with A. j. venaticus while the older samples clustered with the West-African cheetah (A. j. hecki). We conclude that rewilding of cheetahs in Arabia can be sourced from the closest subspecies of the discovered cheetahs. Our results highlight the important role caves may play as repositories of ancient biodiversity informing, in the absence of benchmarks rewilding efforts.

 Snow depth estimation using Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has emerged as a critical tool for monitoring global water environment dynamics. However, traditional linear GNSS-R snow depth estimation methods are often constrained by residual nonlinear errors induced by environmental factors and complex multipath effects. While recent studies have explored machine learning (ML) techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF), their direct snow depth retrieval approaches are still susceptible to residual nonlinear errors during snow-free periods. To address these limitations, we proposes the Dual-Branch ML framework with decoupled architectures for nonlinear interference mitigation in GNSS-R-derived snow depth estimation. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), SVM, RF are employed for efficient snow state detection, and the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), RF then leverage the extracted features (frequency, amplitude, phase, and previous day’s snow depth) to perform the precise regression task for snow depth estimation, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: the proposed method achieves an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.41 cm for the P350 station and 1.89 cm for the AB33 station, with correlation coefficients of 0.995 and 0.999, respectively. This approach not only effectively accounts for nonlinearities in GNSS-R snow depth estimation but also significantly enhances estimation accuracy, offering a robust and promising solution for global snow depth retrieval."

 Carbon satellites, as an essential means of obtaining atmospheric XCO2 concentration, play a key role in monitoring the global carbon cycle. However, the differences in observation platforms, resolutions, and inversion algorithms among different satellites lead to apparent inconsistencies among multi-source XCO2 data, which limits the joint application and comprehensive analysis of the data. In this paper, we develop a framework named MCF-XCO2 (Multi-source Consistency Fusion of XCO2) for correcting multi-source satellite XCO2 observations and performing uncertainty-weighted fusion. The method leverages high-precision satellite products as references, while minimizing the need for direct ground-based correction, to enhance the consistency and overall accuracy of multi-source observations. Based on this framework, multi-source satellite data, including GOSAT, GOSAT-2, OCO-2, and OCO-3, were integrated to construct a sparsely gridded global XCO2 fusion dataset at 0.01° × 0.02° nominal spatial resolution and nominal daily sampling, reflecting available observations. The findings indicate that the fused dataset shows improved coverage in grids with available observations compared to individual satellite products, improved accuracy, and better consistency over time. Independent validation against TCCON ground-based observations further confirms the method's effectiveness, with R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 1.09 ppm, bias = 0.07 ppm, and MRE = 0.2 %. The spatial and temporal dynamic analysis of the fused dataset reveals the typical spatial structure and seasonal variation of global carbon concentration, demonstrating the potential application of this dataset in studying the carbon cycle. The MCF-XCO2 framework is also designed to accommodate future satellite missions, supporting timely updates and extended temporal coverage."

Trigo;Raquel Nieto;Luis Gimeno,Unravelling the drivers of the April–May 2024 extreme precipitation event in Rio Grande do Sul,"•A quasi-stationary blocking high and deep low drove this extreme event •The event was amplified by concurrent heat wave conditions to the north •An atmospheric river-like pattern sustained the anomalous moisture supply •This extreme precipitation event was a high-impact compound event •The event was less predictable and persistent than similar past events. 
 This study examines the extreme precipitation event that caused unprecedented flooding in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, during April–May 2024, leading to record-breaking floods in Porto Alegre. Using data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5, the high-resolution Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation dataset, a Lagrangian moisture tracking approach, and an analogue-based analysis, we identified the atmospheric drivers and moisture sources fueling this event. Results show that a persistent, quasi-stationary dipole configuration, consisting of a high over the South Atlantic and a deep low over southern South America, drove this extreme event. This configuration, reinforced by heat wave conditions over central and southeastern Brazil, favoured a sustained, atmospheric river-like moisture transport from the Amazon region, channelled by a strengthened South American Low-Level Jet east of the Andes, configuring a compound event. We also found that the highest moisture contribution occurred predominantly 1–3 days before the precipitation over RS. The analogue-based analysis revealed that while the mean sea level pressure (MSLP) pattern was uncommon but not unique within the 1991–2020 reference period, the RS extreme event exhibited significantly enhanced moisture transport and uptake from the Amazon region compared to similar past occurrences. Additionally, we found lower predictability and persistence of the MSLP pattern during this event than that of its analogues. Overall, this research underscores the critical role of specific large-scale atmospheric patterns and sustained anomalous moisture supply in driving extreme precipitation, reinforcing the need for an improved understanding of climate-weather interactions and the development of mitigation strategies to address intensifying extreme precipitation events in a changing climate."

The current anode modulation strategies such as tailored solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lithiophilic host architectures can hardly simultaneously resolve all above issues, especially at high-capacity Li deposition. Here, we design a Li-rich, hollow ionic-electronic conductor (HIEC) interlayer, which integrates metallic Li encapsulation and interfacial protection, thus guiding highly reversible thick Li deposition (5 milliampere-hours per square centimeter). In addition, the built-in electron-deficient domains in the HIEC facilitate the formation of the hierarchical SEI and further mitigate active Li corrosion. These synergistic effects of the interlayer enable stable cycling in batteries under both anode-less and anode-free configurations, attaining >99% coulombic efficiency under industrial-level cathode loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This study highlights the significance of interlayers in integrating the SEI and host functions and provides a viable and scalable solution for energy-dense batteries."

We explored this question in the frame of X-chromosome inactivation, a process under strong selective constraint, governed by theXISTlncRNA and its cis-regulators. Using functional approaches on closely related primate species, we show thatXISTregulation has uniquely diverged over a short evolutionary timescale. In human and marmoset embryonic stem cells (ESCs), theJPXlncRNA gene is a major regulator ofXISTexpression. In contrast,JPXhas a minor effect onXISTin macaque ESCs, where it acts together with a macaque-specific enhancer. This occurs within a reshuffled 3D organization of theXISTneighborhood triggered by the insertion of a HERVK transposon in the macaque lineage. Retrospective sequence comparisons revealed that manyXISTregulators are not evolutionarily constrained, supporting the hypothesis that neutrally evolving noncoding elements harbor adaptive potential. These results illuminate how evolutionary recent elements are integrated into preexisting regulatory landscapes."

Using transcriptomic data from human brain tissues, we performed splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) analyses of schizophrenia-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms and identified more than 17,000 sQTLs linked to previously unidentified splicing junctions. Functional prioritization and experimental validation highlighted the synonymous variant rs3935873 within the 16p11.2 GWAS locus strongly associated with an unannotated isoformDOC2A∆Val217-Pro218. rs3935873 was significantly associated with hippocampal volume, and hippocampal overexpression ofDOC2A∆Val217-Pro218in mice recapitulated schizophrenia-relevant behavioral deficits, phenotypes absent inDOC2AFull-Length-overexpressing mice. Overexpression of both isoforms altered excitatory synaptic transmission, structural modeling revealed divergent tertiary configurations between DOC2A∆Val217-Pro218and DOC2AFull-Length, and interactome profiling highlighted that DOC2A∆Val217-Pro218unique interactors are enriched in the myosin II complex and ankyrin binding, suggesting the acquisition of previously unknown structural and regulatory functions by DOC2A∆Val217-Pro218.

Traditionally, GABAergic input was considered as the gatekeeper; thus, receptors closest to the soma were ideally placed to veto excitation. However, recently modeling has advanced several counterintuitive hypotheses. Since laser uncaging can be directed at will to any position, we used photostimulation to show that inhibition near the sealed end of dendrites distal to excitation is more effective than inhibition near the soma in modulating excitation. Further, dendritic inhibition was found to be branch specific. Last, we demonstrate that inhibitory input from multiple thin basal dendrites can centripetally elevate to effectively tune distant excitation at the soma. These findings provide direct experimental evidence supporting theoretical predictions based on dendritic cable properties, revealing the critical role of dendritic geometry in shaping the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission."

Here, we investigate the spectral, temporal, and directional characteristics of room-temperature XDemission from a tungsten diselenide monolayer coupled to a dissipative plasmonic nanocavity. Under resonant plasmon-exciton coupling, the radiative decay rate of XDis accelerated by nearly four orders of magnitude, and correspondingly, the XDlifetime is shortened to a subnanosecond level, making it comparable to that of bright excitons. Fitting the measured lifetimes with a Purcell-formalism–based cavity quantum electrodynamics model allows estimating of the intrinsic room-temperature XDlifetime to be about 24 ± 2.3 microseconds. Furthermore, the measured radiation patterns of the dark excitons show that subtle variations in the nanocavity orientation can effectively tailor the XDemission directionality, important for quantum technologies and optoelectronics applications."

To disentangle the contribution of each active site to the observed enzymatic activity, we developed a cleavage assay involving heterodimers of active and inactive (catalytic residue mutated or inhibitor-bound) monomers. Notably, we found that heterodimerization increased cleavage efficiency per active monomer. In addition, we mapped a network of critical residues bridging the two active sites and probed this network through engineered mutations.

However, the role of crotonate in cancer progression is unknown. Here, we present a crotonate–crotonyl–coenzyme A (CoA)–enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) crotonylation cascade blocking breast cancer growth and metastasis. We demonstrated that crotonate promotes EZH2 degradation via crotonyl-CoA–mediated crotonylation at Lys348in EZH2 (EZH2-K348cr). EZH2-K348cr leads to reduced genome-wide H3K27me3 (trimethylation of lysine-27 on histone-3) occupancy. Crotonate metabolizes to crotonyl-CoA by ACSS2 (acyl-CoA synthetase 2), and then, acyltransferase p300 catalyzes crotonyl-CoA and generates EZH2-K348cr. Crotonylated EZH2 triggers EZH2 ubiquitination and degradation. Administration of crotonate markedly inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis via a crotonate-crotonyl-CoA-EZH2-K348cr cascade. In comparison, crotonate showed better blocking effect than EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in suppressing breast cancer metastasis. The combination of crotonate and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) antibody enhances responses of breast cancer cells to immunotherapy. Together, our findings indicate that crotonate is a promising anticancer drug candidate that suppresses breast cancer growth and metastasis by specifically inducing EZH2 degradation."

Herein, an “inherited noninvasive intracellular recording” methodology was proposed, which was based on the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) with microelectrode array (MEA)–electroporation system (AI-MEA-EP) to enable prolonged monitoring of intracellular APs in cardiomyocytes. It used MEA-electroporation (MEA-EP) for minimally invasive collection of intracellular signals transiently (~1 minute), as well as noninvasive recording of extracellular signals in long term. The recorded extracellular APs were converted into corresponding intracellular APs by a convolutional neural network–long short-term memory–based AI model enhanced by model self-calibration. The intracellular APs detected by the AI-MEA-EP exhibited high consistency with those physically obtained through MEA-EP. It was demonstrated to monitor cardiac intracellular AP under drug treatments and glucose challenging during >5 consecutive days. This method offers a unique solution to achieve prolonged recording of intracellular signals for advancing cardiac research."

However, distinguishing between these sources for reactive chlorine remains challenging. Here, we establish isotopic constraints on the origin of tropospheric reactive chlorine using chemical ionization mass spectrometry to analyze nitryl chloride (ClNO2). Field observations from four regions in China reveal a much broader isotopic value (δ37Cl) range for ClNO2(−21 to +39‰) than previously documented for Earth’s chlorine reservoirs. Notably, significant δ37Cl differences for ClNO2from sea-salt emissions (−9 ± 4‰) and anthropogenic combustion sources (+20 ± 7‰) were identified. These distinct isotopic signatures, combined with field data, highlight the important role of oceanic chlorine in air pollution, with its chemical cycling affecting not only coastal regions but also extending into inland areas. This research advances our understanding of chlorine’s behavior and cycling in the troposphere."

S. Kim,High-precision and low-depth quantum algorithm design for eigenstate problems,"Estimating the eigenstate properties of quantum systems is a long-standing, challenging problem for both classical and quantum computing. Existing universal quantum algorithms typically rely on ideal and efficient query models (e.g., time evolution operator or block encoding of the Hamiltonian), which, however, become suboptimal for actual implementation at the quantum circuit level. Here, we present a full-stack design of quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenenergy and eigenstate properties, which can achieve high precision and good scaling with system size. The gate complexity per circuit for estimating generic Hamiltonians’ eigenstate properties isεO˜(logε−1), which has a logarithmic dependence on the inverse precision ε. For lattice Hamiltonians, the circuit depth of our design achieves near-optimal system-size scaling, even with local qubit connectivity. Our full-stack algorithm has low overhead in circuit compilation, which thus results in a small actual gate count (cnotand non-Clifford gates) for lattice and molecular problems compared to advanced eigenstate algorithms. The algorithm is implemented on IBM quantum devices using up to 2000 two-qubit gates and 20,000 single-qubit gates and achieves high-precision eigenenergy estimation for Heisenberg-type Hamiltonians, demonstrating its noise robustness."

Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of changes in fluvial particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations (CPOC) and fluxes (FPOC) during ice-free seasons of pan-Arctic rivers from 1985 to 2022 on the basis of satellite observations. Across 578,000 kilometers of river length, 18% of the total length experienced a significant increase inCPOC, which exceeds the 11% that exhibited declines, resulting in a net rise. Most increases occurred after 2005, contributing to a 12.6% (0.49 teragrams per year) increase in totalFPOCto the Arctic Ocean between 1985 to 2005 and 2006 to 2022. Regional contrasts highlight distinct possible drivers: increased precipitation in the North American Arctic and atmospheric warming in the Eurasian Arctic. Deepening of the permafrost active layer is also significantly correlated withCPOCincreases. These findings highlight climate-driven fluvial POC export as a key contributor to the Arctic carbon budget and provide a high-resolution, satellite-based dataset that can inform carbon cycle models and data assimilation efforts."

Here, we developed a dual-mode microfluidic immunostaining (Dumi) device, which integrates diagnostic and research workflows into a single, automated platform, reducing tissue section consumption by more than 90%. Using just one to two slides, it enables both regional detection of biomarkers for diagnostic subtyping (≤16) and construction of multiplex tumor microenvironment (TME) maps. Joint analysis of multiregion diagnostic biomarkers in the TME map indicates that tumor cell subpopulations defined by specific diagnostic biomarkers can actively shape their in situ microenvironmental niche. Dumi offers an efficient, cost-effective, and multifunctional immunostaining method, overcoming the limitations of scarce tissue resources and providing a clinically accessible solution to the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges with rare tumors."
