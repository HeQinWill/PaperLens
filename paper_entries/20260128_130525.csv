However, an evaluation of nine CMIP6 models reveals substantial inconsistencies: in some models, mrsos and integrated mrsol agree globally; in others, they align only in specific regions; and in a few, they diverge across all grid cells. These discrepancies arise from a combination of factors, including metadata errors, inconsistent variable definitions, or diagnostic sequencing within the model. We demonstrate how such issues can lead to significant biases, even when both variables are present and seemingly well-defined. As model complexity increases and multi-model comparisons become more common, assumptions about variable equivalence may lead to flawed conclusions. This study highlights the need for routine consistency checks, improved metadata standards, and community-wide practices that ensure reliability of derived variables across ESM outputs, particularly in preparation for CMIP7."

However, the expansion of AR raises concerns about the adverse impacts on biodiversity. While local studies have assessed these impacts, global-scale evaluations remain limited. Our study addressed the need for a comprehensive approach to mitigate the risks of AR and enhance its potential as a nature-based solution for both CDR and biodiversity conservation. Here, we introduce a novel approach for assessing AR’s strategic potential using a species distribution framework that considers both favorable and unfavorable effects on species in forest landscapes. We propose a biome-specific spatial prioritization framework to delineate where AR may negatively affect biodiversity. By adopting a habitat suitability index as a biodiversity proxy, our approach increased the compatibility between climate mitigation goals (i.e. carbon storage) and biodiversity conservation. We found that in forest biomes, and particularly in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome and the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, many areas offer high carbon sequestration per unit area alongside high habitat suitability values. However, even within the same biome, the impact of AR on biodiversity can vary among locations. Among the non-forested biomes, the existing species in temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands are particularly vulnerable to AR if carbon sequestration is prioritized over biodiversity. To mitigate these risks, prioritizing ecosystem restoration can support biodiversity and restore degraded lands to produce ecosystems that are tailored to regional ecological contexts. Our approach highlights how and where AR strategies can be deployed to simultaneously achieve climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation."

Nevertheless, flood resilience in the VMD has improved through engineering and adaptive practices initiated by local governments and farmers. However, the understanding of the internal interactions among flood resilience measures remains limited. Cho Moi district, An Giang province, VMD, has experienced flooding but shown resilience since the implementation of the South Vam Nao project, making it a representative case for flood resilience investigation. This study employs qualitative methods and Bayesian network (BN) analysis to examine the interrelationships among flood resilience measures in Cho Moi district to address the research gap. The results indicate that the project has facilitated coordination between the local governments and citizens, enhancing farmers’ capacity to reduce flood impacts. A BN inference test, assuming that all measures perform at 100% ‘High’ efficiency, illustrates that the current system configuration performs strongly overall. ‘High-dike construction’ is also highlighted as the central measure facilitating the transformation of agricultural practices. Yet, without the presence of high dikes, farmers remain the most critical factor in sustaining resilience, regardless of the adequacy of government-led measures. The study recommends redesigning the height of the high-dike system to mitigate landslide risk and address other environmental problems, such as nutrient-rich alluvium loss and soil compaction, while ensuring adequate flood protection. The study introduces an innovative framework for flood resilience assessment, helping governments understand their water management systems and identify necessary improvements to enhance flood resilience."

Significant attention has been given to a dedicated fund to assist vulnerable countries to recover from climate related L&amp;D. While much of the political discussion focuses on the amount of funding needed and who should pay, less attention is given to risk reduction initiatives eligible for the L&amp;D funding mechanisms. There is also an emerging need to link L&amp;D funding with adaptation (funds) which is not yet being given enough consideration. Against this background, the paper presents different dimensions of L&amp;D for example on severity and compensability, and provides a new perspective that goes beyond the current discourse of economic versus non-economic or direct versus indirect L&amp;D. A global analysis is complemented with a set of L&amp;D related case studies to explore both conventional economic dimensions of L&amp;D, and under-represented dimensions, such as population displacement and human mobility, territory and cultural heritage. These cases highlight how different types of L&amp;D are articulated in climate related initiatives. The cases point towards the need to better connect L&amp;D and adaptation strategies and funding to strengthen climate resilience. The paper informs the ongoing international debate on L&amp;D, highlighting the importance of understanding its different dimensions, the effectiveness of climate-related policies across countries and the need to rethink the concept of L&amp;D as compensation, since this falls short of supporting climate resilience. Recommendations emphasize national and local level monitoring, funding tools and international cooperation."

While most research to date concentrated on climate impacts on crop yields, the climatic determinants of harvested area (ha) which is an equally important component of production, remain insufficiently explored. Employing a machine learning framework on historical maize production and climate datasets, this study evaluates how both mean climate conditions and weather extremes have influenced maize yield and ha across SSA from 1979 to 2021. Our findings indicate that reported yield reductions are predominantly attributable to heat and drought stress, while contractions in ha are primarily associated with episodes of excessive wetness. Notably, our models account for a greater proportion of variance in ha (R2 up to 0.75) than in yield (R2 ≈ 0.43). This suggests that fluctuations in cultivation area are more readily anticipated from climate signals, potentially reflecting farmers’ proactive adjustments to wet conditions, than the more complex physiological responses of yield to heat stress. The rising frequency of area-related shocks, in contrast to relatively stable trends in yield-shock, signals a shifting landscape of production risks. Collectively, these findings elucidate two principal climate-risk pathways: heat and drought diminishing yields, and wetness extremes constraining cultivated area. These insights underscore the urgent need for agronomic innovation, targeted economic incentives, and infrastructural investment to enhance the resilience of maize-based systems in SSA."

Renewable energy such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power provides opportunities to mitigate sectoral water use, but quantifying their effects on the water-energy-land nexus remains challenging. Using an engineering-economic optimization model, this study quantifies how, and to what extent, energy transition towards PV and wind mitigates water competition between the energy and land sectors in the Yellow River Basin from 2020 to 2050. Results show that under current conditions, energy water use increases by 32.9 × 108 m3 yr−1 (+34.2%) while irrigation water decreases by 23.3 × 108 m3 yr−1 (−12.7%) compared to the baseline. Transitioning to PV and wind energy, alongside electricity transmission, substantially alleviates the competition. Energy water use decreases by 82.1 × 10⁸ m3 yr−1 (−63.7%) across the basin, and irrigation water is replenished by 21.9 × 108 m3 yr−1 (+54.7%) in Inner Mongolia and 1.6 × 108 m3 yr−1 (+35.9%) in Shandong. Though costly, the transmission line from Inner Mongolia and Shandong is prioritized for reducing the local consumption of renewable energy, ensuring downstream energy supply and restoring irrigation water availability. These findings underscore the critical role of transitioning to renewable energy in resolving sectoral water conflicts, and highlight the importance of electricity transmission in balancing spatial disparities in energy and irrigation demands across the basin."

We apply causal machine learning to evaluate the heterogeneous impact of winter wheat-based rotations on SOC at the field-level across Lithuania. Using a nationwide dataset collected over five years (2018–2022), including crop types, management practices, soil properties, and environmental conditions, we estimate how the effects of winter wheat-based rotation vary across space and climate. Our results indicate that winter wheat generally enhances SOC levels, but its effectiveness is modulated by climate. Cooler regions experience higher SOC gains, whereas warmer regions show diminished or even negative effects. Future climate projections suggest that the potential for winter wheat carbon sequestration may decline under high-emission scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of localized agricultural strategies that account for climate variability to maximize SOC sequestration and ensure long-term soil sustainability."

However, deforestation and increasingly frequent droughts, heatwaves and wildfires threaten these rainforests. Amazonian fires are generally assumed to be entirely anthropogenic, which has led to lightning-ignited fires being underexplored. Here, we present the first detailed assessment of the spatiotemporal patterns of lightning-ignited fires in the Amazon rainforest to elucidate the role of lightning and human ignitions in shaping Amazon fire dynamics. To do this, we matched cloud-to-ground lightning strokes from the Global Lightning Dataset (GLD360) with individual fire events between 2019 and 2024 to obtain a probability of lightning ignition for each fire. We also calculated a human-ignition probability index using proximity to roads, waterways, and human land cover as proxies for human activity. By combining both probabilistic indices with ground-observed lightning ignitions from eight protected areas, we could optimize the threshold that determines if an ignition is more likely to be caused by lightning or human activities. We estimate that in the Brazilian Amazon, lightning caused on average 0.2%–0.4% of all fires each year (234–407 ignitions per year) and 1.1%–1.2% of the annually burned area (1226–1358 km2 per year) between 2019 and 2024. More than 89% of these fires occurred in the late dry season between August and November, peaking in September and October. Despite lightning-ignited fires contributing a small proportion of all Amazonian fires, they constitute over 25% of the fires in identified grid clusters in parts of the states of Pará (particularly in the Breves region), Amazonas, and Rondônia. This study provides the first estimation of the role of natural ignitions in Amazon fire dynamics and a scientific basis for understanding their contribution within the region."

Under similar radiative forcing, particularly during daytime and clear-sky conditions, its temporal variability is expected to be coupled to surface conditions such as availability of soil moisture and plant functional conditions. In this study, we use Earth observations to identify regions with a strong interannual co-variability between the diurnal amplitude of land surface temperature and surface soil moisture. Land surface temperature is taken from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Applications Facility on Land Surface Analysis and soil moisture from the Copernicus Climate Change Service for the period 2004–2023 over the 0° Meteosat Second Generation region, encompassing Africa and Europe. We introduce a new metric to quantify the soil moisture-temperature interannual co-variability in the satellite data, which is then applied to evaluate the fifth reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ERA5). Earth observations and ERA5 show similar spatial co-variability patterns across much of the domain, highlighting regions of transition between climate zones. However, ERA5 shows weaker co-variability in regions with large interannual vegetation variability. These findings suggest that accurately capturing the interannual variability of land surface temperature and its co-variability with soil moisture, in regions with large vegetation variability, may require a dynamic representation of vegetation status, beyond the mean annual cycles currently implemented in ERA5."

This review presents a systematic analysis of over 40 000 peer-reviewed articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science between 1980 and 2024, classified according to their disciplinary scope, marine environment, and climate-inspired framing (diagnosis, mitigation, adaptation). Our results reveal persistent structural imbalances: biology dominates thematically, beaches and coastlines dominate spatially, and diagnostic efforts far outnumber mitigation or adaptation studies. Crucially, the deep ocean—despite comprising the majority of marine volume and likely acting as a long-term reservoir for microplastics—remains severely underrepresented. Studies that include sampling below 1000 m are rare, and most lack specific geographic metadata. While the growth in microplastics literature is robust, its conceptual and spatial coverage remains narrow. We argue for a strategic expansion of research to include the full depth and breadth of the ocean, and for increased interdisciplinarity to reduce current uncertainties in global plastic budgets and support evidence-based mitigation efforts."

However, the sensitivity of scientific outcomes to dataset choice remains poorly understood, and evaluation using station-based records can favor datasets built heavily on weather stations. Here, we evaluate seven high-resolution daily gridded datasets covering the contiguous United States using independent meteorology from the FLUXNET2015 dataset, with a focus on the implications of dataset choice for process-based tree growth modeling. We find that gridded products tend to capture temperature accurately while consistently overestimating the magnitude and frequency of precipitation and its extremes. Moreover, datasets vary in how they define a ‘day,’ which significantly affects temporal alignment with FLUXNET2015 observations. Despite differences among the datasets, the interannual variability in tree ring simulations is insensitive to dataset choice, likely because daily-scale biases are averaged out through accumulated growth across several months. However, inaccuracies in temperature and precipitation can significantly bias modeled xylem cell production, with systematically higher annual precipitation in the gridded datasets leading to greater xylem production compared to simulations using in situ data. Our results suggest that model applications, especially those that integrate to time scales longer than one day, are likely insensitive to climate dataset choice, but applications that are sensitive to daily climate variations or to absolute climate values need to carefully consider biases in gridded climate products."

As previous studies have shown, we find that current new BEVs, with some exceptions for smaller or shorter-range vehicles, have a higher TCO than conventional alternatives. However, we also present the first comparative analysis of the TCO of used vehicles, which make up 70% of all vehicle purchases in the U.S. We find that for used vehicles, BEVs have the lowest TCO among all powertrains. As vehicle TCO varies spatially and with use patterns, we test 5 different vehicle classes, 17 different U.S. cities, and 5 different charging strategies. The finding that BEVs have the lowest total cost for used vehicles is robust across these variables and is largely driven by vehicle depreciation patterns. We conduct a regression analysis based on 260 000 publicly available used vehicle listings, collected from January to December of 2024. We find that BEVs depreciate more rapidly than other powertrains in the first several years of vehicle life but follow similar depreciation patterns afterwards. With a 7 year ownership period, buying a used (3 year-old) midsize SUV vs a new midsize SUV has a TCO savings of approximately $3000 for an ICEV, $1000 for an HEV or PHEV, and $13 000 for a BEV. These results highlight an opportunity for savings via BEV adoption among used vehicle purchasers."

In the Dutch Southwest Delta, coastal management has turned tidal waters into marine lakes. The ensuing stagnation and stratification in combination with eutrophication has caused a decline in water quality, including decreased oxygen (O2) saturation. Restoring such systems is challenging as exemplified by Lake Veere, which was reconnected to the tidal marine Eastern Scheldt, via a culvert, two decades ago. After an initial improvement, water quality strongly declined again in recent years. Here, we investigate the consequences of the restoration effort on coastal deoxygenation by leveraging existing monitoring data of oxygen, temperature, salinity, and benthic macroinvertebrates. In addition, we quantified the O2 demand of the sediment at selected sites via field measurements. Water quality monitoring data indicate that the restored tidal influence resulted in strong improvements in O2 saturation of bottom waters. However, improvements were confined to the eastern part nearby the inflow of marine water. Modelled bottom water O2 concentrations and observed benthic macroinvertebrate densities are related, and show reduced densities under low-O2, especially for less mobile infauna. This highlights the detrimental effect of deoxygenation on benthic faunal communities. Geochemical analyses reveal a very high sedimentary O2 demand, mainly caused by high concentrations of the reduced solutes ammonium and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). These solutes are toxic and are formed by anaerobic (re)mineralization of organic matter. Furthermore, low availability of easily reducible iron-oxides in the lake sediments mutes the formation of iron-sulphides, explaining high porewater H2S concentrations, and release of H2S into bottom waters. Combined, our results illustrate the challenge of restoring a coastal ecosystem by increasing lateral oxygen supply without addressing the legacy effects of eutrophication in the sediments, reemphasizing the importance of nutrient reductions in restoration strategies."

Although the natural gas leakage rate is not high (1.12 %), the greenhouse effect caused by natural gas leakage can not be ignored. 
 Natural gas will continue to replace coal in the process of global energy structure reform, but its leakage potential can delay the realization of global carbon neutrality. To quantify its impact, we established a carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux detection platform on the 220 m platform of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, located in northwestern Beijing. The observation results indicated that the daily mean CO2 and CH4 fluxes were 12.21 ± 1.75 µmol m−2 s−1  and 95.54 ± 18.92 nmol m−2 s−1, respectively. The fluxes were significantly correlated with natural gas consumption, indicating that natural gas has become a common source of CH4 and CO2, the combustion of which releases CO2, while its leakage processes emit CH4. Vehicle-based identification demonstrated that CH4 can escape at the production, storage and use stages of natural gas. Based on natural gas consumption data, the upper limit of the calculated natural gas leakage rate in Beijing reached 1.12 % ± 0.22 %, indicating that the contribution of CH4 to climate change could reach 23 % of that of CO2 on a 20-year scale. Natural gas leakage was estimated to delay the time for China to achieve carbon neutrality by at least almost four years."

Bednarz,"Air quality impacts of stratospheric aerosol injections are likely small and mainly driven by changes in climate, not aerosol settling","Stratospheric aerosol injection is a proposed method to slow global warming by adding tiny reflective particles high up in the atmosphere to cool the planet. We study how this proposed method might affect air quality and human health using climate models. We find that the health impacts would likely be small and are mainly driven by changes in climate, not by the particles themselves. 
 Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is a proposed climate intervention method to offset future global warming through increased solar reflection in the stratosphere, but its broader environmental and public health implications are yet to be thoroughly explored. We use three large ensembles of fully coupled CESM2-WACCM6 simulations to assess changes in mortality attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and surface ozone exposure (O3). Maintaining temperatures at 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels through SAI is projected to yield a modest 0.4 % (ensemble range: −1.9 % to +1.5 %) reduction in pollution-related mortality relative to middle-of-the-road climate change scenario, reflecting a 1.3 % (−2.3 % to −0.6 %) reduction in ozone-related deaths and a 0.9 % (−0.4 % to +2.1 %) increase in PM2.5-related deaths. The spread among ensemble members underscores the influence of internal variability and highlights the importance of ensemble-based analyses when assessing the potential health impacts of climate intervention strategies. We find that global PM2.5 mortality changes exhibit little sensitivity to injected sulfate amounts, with the most variability driven by precipitation-mediated changes in non-sulfate PM2.5 species (e.g., dust and secondary organic aerosols), whereas ozone-related mortality is primarily driven by surface cooling and hemispheric asymmetries in stratospheric-tropospheric exchange and ozone transport. However, our results heavily reflect the specific forcing patterns of the SAI scenarios used; our estimates are also limited by model shortcomings, including omitting the effects of aerosols in the photolysis scheme – which might limit UV-driven changes and impact surface ozone rates – or not including nitrate aerosols. Within our framework, we find that SAI impacts on pollution-related mortality are modest but regionally heterogeneous, and that the magnitude of the SAI-driven changes is smaller than the improvements expected from near-term air quality policies planned or implemented within the same time frame."

 This paper explores whether it is possible to achieve consistency between ground-based infrared radiance measurements made in the presence of cirrus, co-located in-situ aircraft measurements of the cirrus microphysics, and ancillary ground-based remote sensing. Specifically we use spectrally resolved radiances covering the range 400–1500 cm−1, in-situ measurements of cirrus particle sizes and habits, backscatter ceilometer observations of cloud vertical structure and microwave inferred temperature and humidity profiles to investigate whether we can obtain consistency between the derived cloud properties and atmospheric state from these independent sources of data. The primary focus of this study is on the sensitivity of the retrieved cloud particle size to the assumed crystal habit. Excellent consistency between the retrieved cloud parameters is achieved both with the ceilometer derived optical depth and the size distribution measured by the aircraft by assuming the crystal habit to be comprised of bullet rosettes. The averaged values of the effective diameter and optical depth obtained from radiometric  measurements are (26.5 ± 1.8) µm and (0.12 ± 0.01) in comparison with the values derived from in-situ and ceilometer measurements equal to (31.5 ± 5.0) µm and (0.13 ± 0.01), respectively.   Furthermore, we show that the radiance information contained within the far-infrared (wavenumbers < 650 cm−1) spectrum is critical to achieving this level of agreement with the in-situ aircraft observations. The results emphasize why it is vital to expand the current limited database of measurements encompassing the far-infrared spectrum, particularly in the presence of cirrus, to explore whether this finding holds over a wider range of conditions."

Hayes,"Emerging Mineral Dust Source in ’A’ą̈y Chù’ Valley, Yukon, Canada Poses Potential Health Risk via Exposure to Metal and Metalloids Enriched in PM10 and PM2.5 Size Fractions","Glacial sediment of the ’A’ą̈y Chù’ Valley in Yukon, Canada is exposed to strong winds, and consequently, has become a significant mineral dust source. Mineral dust is known to have an impact on human health, partly due to various metals it contains, with the size of the particles also being an important factor. The goal of this study was to determine the concentration of various metals in the dust, how this relates to dust size, and whether air quality standards were surpassed. 
 The ’A’ą̈y Chù’ Valley in Kluane National Park and Reserve, Yukon, Canada has undergone significant hydrological change in the past decade due to climate-driven glacial recession. This has reverted the ’A’ą̈y Chù’ to a major source of sediment-derived mineral dust, representing an environmental change for the region. Mineral dust influences climatic radiative forcing and impacts human health, both of which depend on its concentration, size distribution, and composition. This work discusses results from a field campaign conducted in the ’A’ą̈y Chù’ Valley in 2021 aimed at understanding and quantifying these parameters, with comparison to a previous campaign in the same location to evaluate the evolution of the dust emissions between 2018 and 2021. An optical particle counter (OPC) instrument measured a mean volume diameter of airborne dust of 4.43 µm at 3.3 m above ground, with Coulter Counter measurements being used for comparison and validation. The concentration of many metal(loid)s in the dust were also studied: Al, Ag, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Tl, U, and V. It was found that 24 h ambient air quality criteria for exposure to several metal(loid)s were surpassed. Significant enrichment of several metal(loid)s was observed for both the PM10 and PM2.5 size fractions relative to the Total Suspended Material (TSP) fraction of the mineral dust and the parent soil. This suggests that the mineral dust in the ’A’ą̈y Chù’ Valley possesses compounding characteristics that are detrimental to human health due to exposure to potentially toxic metal(loid) concentrations."

Santee,Version 8 IMK/IAA MIPAS measurements of ClO,"We present a global climatology of Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) version 8 chlorine monoxide (ClO), retrieved from spaceborne observations between 2002 and 2012. Due to an improved retrieval setup, the high bias and poor vertical resolution of upper stratospheric ClO, which had affected the previous V5 data set, has been removed. Comparisons with ClO observations of the Microwave Limb Sounder generally show good agreement. Differences can be explained by simulations with an atmospheric chemistry model. 
 Global distributions of chlorine monoxide (ClO) were retrieved from infrared limb emission spectra recorded with the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), covering the time period from July 2002 to April 2012. The retrieval was performed by constrained non-linear least squares fitting using spectral lines in the fundamental band of ClO around 844 cm−1. The vertical resolution of V8 ClO is 4 km at 18–20 km and 7.5–9.5 km at 40 km altitude. The considerable improvement at 40 km with respect to the previous V5 data version is achieved by extension of the spectral range for retrieval of upper stratospheric ClO. Errors are by far dominated by measurement noise and increase from 0.4–0.5 ppbv at 20 km to 0.8 ppbv at 50 km altitude. Thus, in general, individual ClO profiles are noisy, and profile averaging has to be performed for, e.g., analysis of the upper stratospheric maximum. However, strongly enhanced lower stratospheric ClO amounts of more than 1.5 ppbv during polar winter are well detected in single measurements. Along with the standard representation of the data, an alternative coarse grid representation that obviates the need to apply averaging kernels in certain situations is also provided. Due to improved modeling of the atmospheric continuum and the instrumental offset, the high bias in upper stratospheric ClO that had particularly affected the previous V5 data over the period 2005–2012 has been removed. A comparison with ClO measurements of the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite shows good agreement between the lower stratospheric enhancements observed by the two instruments in polar winter. There is also good agreement between the upper stratospheric ClO amounts observed in the northern hemisphere and at southern hemispheric low latitudes. With the support of simulations from the Earth system model ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC), deviations between the ClO amounts of MIPAS and MLS in the Antarctic lower stratosphere during July and in the upper stratosphere, especially at southern mid- and high latitudes during winter, are attributed to the different local solar times of the measurements."

The database includes over 70 000 nitrogen isotope records from 417 studies, along with essential geological context and related chemical data. This database will help reveal the mechanisms behind critical events like mass extinctions and major ocean changes, enhancing our understanding of Earth's long-term environmental processes. 
 Stable nitrogen isotope records preserved in marine sediments provide critical insights into Earth's climate history and biospheric evolution. Although numerous studies have documented nitrogen isotope (δ15N) records for various geological systems (Archean to Recent) and paleogeographic settings, the scientific community remains constrained by the absence of a standardized database to systematically investigate their spatiotemporal evolution. Here, we present the database of Deep-time Sediment Nitrogen Isotopes in Marine Systems (DSMS-NI), a comprehensive global compilation of δ15N data and associated geochemical parameters, spanning a vast collection of sediment samples dating from the Recent to the Archean. This database encompasses 70 854 δ15N records derived from 417 publications, systematically organized with 31 metadata fields categories (e.g., chronostratigraphic ages, coordinates, lithology, metamorphic grade, sedimentary facies, references) encompassing 1 999 226 metadata. This repository further incorporates 130 proxy data fields, including 281 215 geochemical data spanning total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and organic carbon isotopes (δ13Corg), major and trace elements and iron species. These integrated parameters enable evaluation of sample fidelity and factors influencing δ15N signatures. The DSMS-NI database will facilitate research for key geological intervals such as the Permian/Triassic boundary and the Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). Researchers can leverage temporal and paleogeographic information, alongside geochemical data, to conduct spatiotemporal analyses, thereby uncovering changes in deep-time marine nitrogen cycles and paleoenvironmental conditions. The database is open-access via the Geobiology portal (https://geobiologydata.cug.edu.cn/, last access: 30 April 2025), allowing users to access data and submit new entries to ensure continuous updates and expansion.

For each region and year, exposure to temperature change of agriculture—rural population, land use area, harvested area, livestock numbers and production value—was defined as the share of regional aggregates over the total. We computed exposure indicators to ΔT > 1.5 °C and ΔT > 2.0 °C. Results help highlight which regions may be most in need of adaptation preparedness. 
 We used available FAO statistics as input metrics to compute simple indicators of exposure of agriculture at regional and global levels to temperature change thresholds, ΔT > 1.5 °C and ΔT > 2.0 °C, relative the 1951–1980 climatology. Since 1995 and with respect to ΔT > 1.5 °C, results show that exposure of rural populations increased globally 14 times (from 64 to 920 million people); exposed agricultural land area grew five-fold (from 350 to 2000 million hectare, Mha). The exposed harvested area of soybean increased globally 90 times (0.5 to 45 Mha); rice 78 times (0.5 to 39 Mha); maize 38 times (2 to 76 Mha) and wheat 5 times (22 to 110 Mha). Finally, exposure of livestock grew six-fold for dairy cows and 20-fold for chicken broilers. Among regions, Europe had the largest exposure to ΔT > 1.5 °C, with more than 80 % of its rural population, cropland area, dairy cattle, maize and wheat harvested areas exposed in 2024. Exposure indicators for Central Asia, Western Asia and Northern Africa were above 65 % for cropland area and wheat harvested area. The computed exposure indicators were found to increase nearly exponentially over the period 1961–2024 across all regions, highlighting the urgency of implementing appropriate agricultural adaptation strategies to avert possible negative impacts in coming decades.

It provides a reliable baseline for analyzing food production trends and helps policymakers track progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger. 
 Accurate, high-resolution spatial data of paddy rice are indispensable for assessing global food security and tracking progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger). However, a consistent global rice map at medium-to-high resolution has been lacking due to the challenges of cloud contamination and the temporal irregularity of multi-source satellite archives. Here, we present GlobalRice20, the first global 20m resolution paddy rice dataset for the years 2015 and 2024.

 Contrails — thin ice clouds formed by aircraft — are a major contributor to aviation-induced climate forcing, yet their observational characterization remains limited. We present a manually labeled contrail dataset derived from observations of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) SEVIRI instrument over Europe and the North Atlantic, comprising 140 scenes of 256 × 256 pixels.

By blending satellite images with computer models using artificial intelligence, researchers created continuous, high-resolution daily maps of these gases globally and for China from 2019 to 2023. This data accurately tracks pollution from wildfires and farming, offering a key tool for leaders to monitor air quality and check the impact of environmental policies. 
 Long-term, high-resolution monitoring of carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) is essential for understanding their spatiotemporal variability and guiding climate mitigation strategies. However, satellite observations like TROPOMI are often incomplete, and existing fusion methods have limitations in accuracy and continuity. This study proposes a signal-domain fusion approach combining 3D discrete cosine transform (DCT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to integrate TROPOMI data with GEOS-Chem simulations. A lightweight residual U-Net is employed to refine the initial reconstruction by learning the residual field using meteorological drivers and model outputs, guided by a masked loss. The method produces global 0.25° and China-specific 0.05° daily gap-free XCO and XCH4 datasets from 2019 to 2023. The fused results outperform GEOS-Chem and are comparable or superior to TROPOMI, with R² values of 0.92 for XCO and 0.85 for XCH4. Trend analysis reveals regional patterns such as XCO increases in North America and declines in Eastern China, and widespread CH4 growth. High-resolution data captures enhancements during the 2022 Chongqing wildfires, with average increases of 17.1 ppb in XCO and 24.5 ppb in XCH4, and reveals lower XCH4 increases over rice-growing areas compared to TROPOMI, with overestimation reduced by 17–26 %, and stronger XCO reductions, with satellite underestimations up to 38 %. These results highlight agricultural contributions and policy impacts. This approach effectively reconstructs missing observations and enhances the utility of satellite–model data for atmospheric research and emission assessments.

 Accurate urban flash flood forecasting relies on well-spatialized rainfall data distribution. This study introduces and utilizes the TTI-HydroMet dataset, a publicly available and unique collection for the Tamanduateí River Watershed, in Sao Paulo (Brazil). The dataset includes rainfall measurements from 23 rain gauge stations, stage observations from a hydrological gauge near the outlet, and quantitative precipitation estimates at 1-km radar resolution, accumulated in 10-minute precipitation fields over 10 years. The weather radar data presents missing values for only 0.3 % of timestamps during rainfall events observed by rain gauges. The Spearman correlation coefficient between weather radar and rain gauges varies from 0.675 (full period) to 0.949 (a specific event). It was used to assess the predictive capacity of Machine Learning (ML) hydrological models trained on accumulated rainfall data from rain gauges and estimated by a weather radar. Using an advanced cross-validation framework, two representative algorithms (LinearSVR and XGBRegressor) were tested across different rainfall source configurations and showed strong performance at lead times up to 120 minutes. The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency index ranges from 0.781 to 0.996. The statistically comparable performance of ML models driven by radar and rain gauge rainfall indicates that radar-based ML approaches can represent a viable alternative for short-term stage forecasting in regions lacking rain gauge networks."

We undertook calculations with an Earth system model using a high-performance computer to explore hydrogen atmospheric dynamics. Simulations with our model yielded highly accurate results at global scale. Correctly representing hydroxyl radicals in the model is a critical requirement for predicting hydrogen concentrations well. Our hydrogen budget is also in very good agreement with bottom-up literature estimates. 
 In this study, we use an earth system model with detailed atmospheric chemistry (EMAC v2.55.2) to undertake simulations of hydrogen (H2) atmospheric dynamics. Extensive global equilibrium simulations were performed with a horizontal resolution of 1.9°. The results of this simulation are compared with observational data from 56 stations in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) Carbon Cycle Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network. We introduced H2 sources and sinks, the latter inclusive of a soil uptake scheme, that accounts for bacterial consumption. The model thus accounts for detailed H2 and methane (CH4) flux boundary conditions. Results from the EMAC model are accurate and predict the magnitude, amplitude and interhemispheric seasonality of the annual H2 cycle at most observational stations. Time series comparison of EMAC and observational data produces Pearson correlation coefficients (r) in excess of 0.9 at eight remote stations located in polar regions and on high mid-latitude islands. A further 23 stations yielded correlation coefficients between 0.7–0.9, predominantly located in remote marine stations across all latitudes and also in polar regions. The quality of model predictions (r<0.5, 9 stations) is reduced in anthropogenically highly polluted stations in east Asia and the Mediterranean region and stations impacted by peat fire emissions in Indonesia, as local and incidental emissions are difficult to capture. Our H2 budget corroborates bottom-up estimates in the literature in terms of source and sink strengths and overall atmospheric burden. By simulating hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the atmosphere leading to a CH4 lifetime in agreement with observationally constrained estimates, we show that the EMAC model is a capable tool for undertaking high accuracy simulation of H2 at global scale. Future research applications could target the impact of potentially significant natural and anthropogenic H2 sources on air quality and climate, reducing uncertainties in the H2 soil sink and impacts of H2 release on the future oxidising capacity of the atmosphere."

The database is designed to support habit-evolving microphysical schemes, which predict continuous changes in ice particle properties rather than the traditionally assumed fixed categories. It includes over 2600 individual crystals and 450 aggregates with varying riming degrees and morphology. 
 The optical properties of atmospheric hydrometeors are a crucial component of any forward operator. These forward operators are essential data assimilation, and atmospheric model evaluations. Recent advances in microphysical modelling, such as Lagrangian super-particle models with habit prediction for ice particles, allow for the continuous evolution of particle properties in contrast to fixed hydrometer classes with fixed properties. This increasing complexity demands scattering databases capable of handling a wide range of particle properties.The discrete dipole approximation (DDA) is one of the most accurate and widely used methods for computing the scattering properties of irregular ice particles. However, its high computational cost typically limits either the diversity of particle shapes or the range of environmental parameters (e.g., frequency, temperature) represented in existing databases, constraining their applicability to models with highly variable microphysics.In this study, we present a new DDA-based database of optical properties at 5.6, 9.6, 35.6, and 94 GHz, specifically designed to accommodate the broad range of ice crystal morphologies predicted by habit-evolving schemes. The database contains 2627 individual ice crystals, including dendrites, plates, and columns, as well as 450 aggregates with varying degrees of riming and crystal types. The data are organized in three levels: Level 0 provides raw scattering matrices at individual orientations for a full range of scattering angles; level 1a summarizes Mueller and Amplitude matrix elements relevant for radar applications (at forward and backward scattering angles); and level 1b offers lookup tables of scattering properties that are relevant for polarimetric radars assuming azimuthally random orientations of the particles.

Low-Current-Enhanced Electrocatalytic Ozonation through Synergistic Surface •OH Generation and Mass Transfer,"This study challenges the conventional “higher current, better performance” paradigm in electrocatalytic ozonation (ECO) by demonstrating that reduced current operation simultaneously enhances pollutant removal, surface radical generation, and mass transfer through interface-dominated catalysis. Two systems using a TiO2 nanoflower (TiO2-NF)-modified porous anode coupled with graphite-loaded (GT-ECO) or pristine (PT-ECO) titanium mesh cathodes revealed fundamentally different reaction pathways. GT-ECO achieved complete p-CBA removal at 50 mA─4-fold lower than PT-ECO at 200 mA─through synergistic electrode functions: the TiO2-NF anode enabled H2O2-independent O3 activation, generating surface-localized •OH, while the GT cathode maintained elevated potentials for selective O3 electroreduction without H2 evolution. In situ electrochemical confocal fluorescence microscopy provided the first direct visualization of electric field-dependent surface •OH generation at the TiO2-NF anode, confirming potential-regulated interfacial catalysis as the governing mechanism. Reduced current paradoxically enhances O3 mass transfer of the O3 at the porous anode through interfacial renewal, liquid film thinning, and bubble refinement. This anode-focused approach fundamentally departs from conventional cathode-driven H2O2-mediated strategies, enabling remarkable energy efficiency with operational safety and environmental robustness. These results emphasized the synergistic enhancement between surface catalysis and mass transfer and offered a new theoretical perspective on interfacial regulation in low-current ECO processes."

This study examined the roles of acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) from Dietzia aurantiaca strain J3, as well as glutathione (GSH), in the biotransformation of fluorotelomer compounds. Heterologously expressed and purified ACS and GST from strain J3 were evaluated for their catalytic activities toward selected fluorinated and nonfluorinated carboxylates. Results showed that J3 ACS catalyzed the formation of CoA adducts with long-chain fluorinated compounds, including 2H-perfluoro-2-octenoic acid (6:2 FTUCA) and 5:3 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylate (5:3 FTUCA), providing the first experimental evidence of CoA adduct formation for eight-carbon PFAS. Notably, no enzymatic activity was observed toward saturated analogues (5:3 FTCA and 6:2 FTCA) or PFOA, with kinetic analysis suggesting that unsaturation and chain length are critical determinants of enzyme reactivity. While GST exhibited no activity toward the tested fluorinated substrates, GSH adducts were observed with 5:3 FTUCA and 6:2 FTUCA via spontaneous, nonenzymatic thiol conjugation. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that β-oxidation-like pathways, initiated by CoA conjugation, and GSH-dependent conjugation reactions are both involved in the biotransformation of long-chain polyfluorinated carboxylates."

The absorption and adverse effects of pollutants are markedly influenced by sex. However, insights into sex-specific differences in PCB oral bioavailability remain limited. In this study, PCB oral bioavailability was assessed in adult female and male Balb/c mice. At different exposure doses, the oral bioavailability of PCBs in female mice (14.2–22.8%) was significantly higher than that in male mice (12.3–18.8%). Correspondingly, males excreted a greater proportion of PCBs via feces, with fecal excretion percentages of 9.50–10.4% in males compared to 6.98–8.13% in females. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the higher PCB oral bioavailability in females was associated with greater dietary lipid assimilation efficiency and elevated postprandial serum apoB-48 levels, which are key indicators of chylomicron-mediated transport of lipophilic pollutants. Gut microbiota analysis revealed a more pronounced increase in Desulfovibrio abundance in female mice (from 6.57% to 18.18%) than in males (4.95% to 7.89%). This sex-specific change may be related to the impaired intestinal barrier and thereby enhanced PCB absorption in female mice. Liver transcriptomics revealed that PCB exposure primarily altered lipid metabolism-related genes in female mice, while male mice exhibited stronger responses in xenobiotic metabolism and DNA toxicity pathways. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving sex differences in PCB oral bioavailability and hence the adverse effects, offering key insights for crafting targeted strategies to reduce PCB exposure across diverse subpopulations."

The solid–liquid distribution coefficient (logKd) is a key parameter for PFAS mobility, but current machine learning (ML) models often overlook its susceptibility to real-world water chemistry. To address this, we introduce the Phys-ML Sorp Framework, a novel multiscale approach integrating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with ML to enhance logKd prediction. We quantified physically informed microscopic features from MD simulations, including radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and a novel effective activity coefficient (logγ) that uniquely captures solute conformational responses by incorporating MD-derived Rg into an extended Debye–Hückel equation, offering a physically meaningful measure of nonideal solution effects. Leveraging 499 PFAS partitioning observations in pure water and calcium chloride (CaCl2) systems, our model achieved superior predictive performance (RPD = 2.90, RMSE = 0.32). The incorporation of MD-derived microscopic features resulted in a 14.62% improvement in RPD and a 13.52% reduction in RMSE over models relying solely on macroscopic parameters. SHAP analysis revealed molecular weight (MW, 0.32), SASA (0.28), logKow (0.23), Rg (0.08), and logγ (0.07) as dominant factors. This framework not only advances environmental pollutant modeling but also establishes a robust, mechanistically informed approach for enhanced environmental risk assessment."

Large-scale models typically simplify BC mixing state representation due to computational constraints, often resulting in substantial overestimations of light absorption. Under the steady-state assumption, we present a physically grounded inversion approach to infer the mixing state of coated BC (CBC) particles by mapping bulk volume and volume fraction of BC cores to the total number concentration and coating thickness distribution parameter (k), based on preset number-size distributions of BC core diameter. By introducing the k-value, we reconstruct the two-dimensional distribution of CBC particles for calculating key optical properties through efficient lookup tables. The inversion approach is validated against both particle-resolved model simulations and field observations, yielding mean relative errors of below 5% for optical properties. Compared to traditional assumptions of uniform composition, our approach accounts for coating thickness heterogeneity among CBC particles, improving optical evaluation in models with a negligible additional computational cost. This work provides a practical and scalable solution to represent the BC mixing state in atmospheric models, facilitating more reliable assessments of BC radiative effects in air quality and climate studies."

The net carbon benefits of GI and the factors shaping them remain poorly understood due to data and methodological gaps. This study draws on 679 engineering cases from 15 demonstration Sponge Cities in China to conduct multiscale life-cycle carbon accounting of GI. Overall, sponge retrofitting shifted conventional urban surfaces from a net source to a sink. At the infrastructure scale, carbon benefits varied widely across different types of GI, mainly due to differences in construction materials and operational efficiency. At the project scale, all project types achieved net carbon benefits, with variations primarily driven by infrastructure configuration. Regionally, carbon payback periods ranged from 7.5 to 28.6 years, depending on rainfall volume control rates and infrastructure composition, with wetter regions achieving higher net benefits. To maximize cost-effective runoff, pollution, and carbon reduction, NSGA-II favored green roofs and sunken green spaces without considering landscape functions. Ensuring stable carbon benefits under climate change and overdesign storms requires future GI to adopt sustainable and resilient pathways. By integrating life cycle assessment with multiobjective optimization, this study establishes a novel framework for decoupling carbon emissions from infrastructure growth, offering actionable pathways for global carbon-neutral urban design."

While ozone exposure has been linked to anxiety and depression, reliance on ambient measurements may misrepresent personal exposure. This study examined associations between ozone exposure at ambient, indoor, and personal levels and anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbance among young adults, and assessed sleep quality as a potential mediator. A nationwide cross-sectional survey (2023–2024) was conducted across 261 Chinese municipalities. Annual maximum 8-h ozone concentrations over the preceding year were estimated at outdoor, indoor, and personal exposure levels. Validated scales were used to assess anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and sleep quality (PSQI). Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analysis within a logistic framework were applied, adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioral, and health condition covariates. Among 13,028 participants, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbance was 14%, 19%, and 39%, respectively. Associations with anxiety and depressive symptoms varied modestly across outdoor, indoor, and personal ozone exposure. Per interquartile range increase in outdoor, indoor, and personal ozone concentrations, odds ratios for anxiety were 1.17, 1.19, and 1.14; corresponding estimates for depression were 1.14, 1.13, and 1.10. Sleep quality mediated 10–30% and 16–49% of the ozone-anxiety and ozone-depression associations, respectively. These findings suggest that incorporating indoor and personal exposure metrics may provide additional insight into ozone-related mental health risks, with sleep quality serving as a mediator."

This study aimed to quantify errors in ambient data proxies and develop a scalable modeling framework for personal exposure prediction using readily available data. We conducted a panel study with 12 adults from three diverse Chinese cities, collecting 4571 person-hours of personal PM2.5 measurements. These were compared against three ambient data sources to quantify relative errors. We developed a modeling framework integrating ambient concentrations, meteorological variables, and basic personal characteristics, incorporating systematic preprocessing, feature engineering, variable selection, and multialgorithm comparison optimized through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Results showed substantial personal-ambient exposure discrepancies, with relative errors of 39–48% for the daily average level. The framework successfully predicted personal exposure, with a Random Forest model using daily monitoring-station data achieving the highest performance (R2 = 0.87). SHAP analysis identified ambient PM2.5 as the dominant predictor, with personal traits and meteorology also contributing significantly. This work provides a validated, end-to-end modeling framework that moves beyond ambient proxies, offering a standardized workflow to refine personal exposure estimates in large cohorts and enhance the validity of air pollution health studies."

At 10 and 100 μM, PFOS enhanced adipogenesis, promoting intracellular oil droplet accumulation and upregulating key markers, including PPARγ, perilipin, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), CD36, fatty acid synthase (FASN), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). It also increased adipokines (adiponectin and resistin). Compared to troglitazone (TGZ), a PPARγ agonist, PFOS induced milder differentiation effects. Cotreatment with PFOS and TGZ diminished TGZ’s pro-adipogenic potency, indicating potential interference. PFOS further influenced N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modifications by altering the expression of m6A writers (METTL3 and VIR) and eraser (FTO), suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of adipogenic genes. Functional evaluations showed that PFOS preserved forskolin-stimulated lipolysis without impairing it. However, it upregulated metabolic markers, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT1a), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK), and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21), alongside elevated ATP levels in the 100 μM PFOS-treated group. These molecular changes suggest enhanced energy expenditure or energy stress, despite the cells’ morphological resemblance to white adipocytes. This duality likely arises from PFOS’s modulation of PPARγ signaling and m6A RNA modifications. By elucidating these mechanisms, the study highlights potential metabolic risks associated with PFOS exposure."

However, research on the specific mechanism remains extremely limited. In this study, a multi-methodological framework integrating network toxicology, machine learning, and molecular docking was adopted to explore the potential toxicity and molecular mechanisms of PFAS-induced NAFLD. Key molecular targets were identified by integrating transcriptomic data with toxicological databases such as CTD, ToxCast, and GeneCards. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) was constructed using integrated PFAS–gene–phenotype evidence, and the interaction network was visualized via Cytoscape. The AOP was further validated through in vitro experiments, QWoE assessment, and clinical sample analysis. We determined that the downregulation of THBS1 serves as the molecular initiating event (MIE) in PFAS-induced NAFLD. This downregulation leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which subsequently triggers lipid metabolic dysregulation and inflammatory responses, ultimately resulting in hepatic steatosis. HFPO-TA causes more pronounced lipid accumulation than PFOA or HFPO-DA at the same concentration, suggesting a higher adipogenic potential. It is particularly worth noting that alternative PFASs may have greater metabolic toxicity than traditional compounds like PFOA. This study clarifies the mechanistic foundation of the AOP of PFAS-induced NAFLD, thus providing support for risk assessment and the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

Cord blood samples are frequently employed in epidemiological studies to evaluate the links between contaminant exposure and birth outcomes. However, a significant knowledge gap persists regarding the presence of QACs in cord blood and their potential associations with birth outcomes. In this study, QACs were analyzed in 235 cord blood samples collected in a hospital in Jinan, Shandong Province, from February 2017 to January 2022. QACs were detected in the investigated cord blood samples, with total concentrations reaching up to 47.3 ng/mL. Benzylalkyldimethyl ammonium compounds (BACs) accounted for the largest proportion, with BAC-C12 and BAC-C14 being the most abundant QACs. The multiple linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were developed to explore the relationships between QACs exposure and newborn birth outcomes. Results showed that BAC-C10, BAC-C16, and octyl decyldimethyl ammonium-8:10 were positively associated with birth weight and ponderal index (p for trend < 0.05), suggesting an obesogenic hypothesis. Furthermore, these three QAC structures can activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ, the core adipogenesis receptor). The margin of exposure results indicated that the obesogenic risks of QACs were limited under current exposure distributions, but ongoing attention is warranted due to uncertainties and sensitive life stages."

However, the detection of these particles in human tissues, fluids, cell systems, and relevant models remains a major analytical challenge. There is an urgent need for robust, selective, sensitive, and high-throughput methods capable of generating reliable quantitative data. Equally essential is the transparent reporting of methodological limitations and uncertainties, supported by rigorous data collection and standardized practices. These challenges are compounded by the ubiquity of plastic particles, and therefore the risk of sample contamination and their diverse properties (e.g., size, shape, composition), all adding to the complexity of identifying and quantifying them in biological matrices. To address these issues, we propose a framework that integrates orthogonal analytical techniques to enhance the data reliability. Commonly used analytical techniques for the analysis of micro- and nanoplastics are assigned a category based on their specificity when identifying plastic particles. The framework proposes minimum data requirements from orthogonal techniques for the identification of plastic particles at various confidence levels. Clear communication of analytical confidence is vital, and we present a structured approach to support this. We emphasize the importance of scientific integrity, rigorous study design, and transparent reporting in health research. Finally, we call for the universal adoption of harmonized confidence criteria for reporting the presence of plastics in humans, an essential step toward informed decision-making."

 Changes in the translation speed of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) pose great challenges in disaster preparedness. While some recent studies have discussed the increased chance of a reduction in the annual-mean translation speed of TCs after landfall, such changes before landfall have not been systematically investigated, especially for short-term variations (that is, hour-to-day timescales). Here we show, first based on observations, that globally, a TC about to make landfall tends to accelerate towards the coast, with an average acceleration of about 0.83 m s−1 per day, which means that the mean translation speed of a landfalling TC increases by ~48% during the 60-h period before landfall. Such an acceleration exists irrespective of TC intensity, seasonality and ocean basin, although its magnitude varies. Numerical simulations demonstrate that land–sea differences in surface roughness and thermal effect result in asymmetric circulation and convection in TCs, both of which are enhanced as the TC moves closer to the coast, leading to local changes in potential vorticity and thereby accelerating the storm. As this phenomenon is due to the land–sea contrast, a TC approaching the coast will probably have such an acceleration and hence it is inherent. Landfalling tropical cyclones generally accelerate as they approach coastlines due to changes in surface roughness and thermal properties, according to numerical modelling simulations and global observations."

Here, the authors demonstrate ultrafast and reversible dynamic Stark modulation of a semiconductor exciton-polariton quantum condensate. 
 Time-dependent spatial modulation of a quantum condensate plays a key role in the investigation of the dynamics of collective coherent systems. Cold-atom condensates were already manipulated into forming solitons, vortices and optical lattices via the dynamic Stark effect. In the solid-state framework, semiconductor microcavity exciton-polaritons present an excellent platform for observing nonequilibrium condensate dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamic manipulation of exciton-polariton condensates offers numerous potential implementations in all-optical logic devices. We report the first observation of the energy modulation of an exciton-polariton condensate via the dynamic Stark effect. A Stark pulse is employed to induce a transient, coherence-preserving blueshift in the energy of the condensate of femtosecond-scale duration. A novel approach is presented for discerning the Stark effect in a condensate from the uncondensed case according to distinctive features in differential reflectance spectra, including spectro-temporal oscillations enabling to detect the buildup of coherence. The ultrafast and non-invasive modulation of the exciton-polariton condensate demonstrated here opens new research avenues of nonequilibrium physics of solid-state condensates as well as opportunities for polariton-based elements in both classical and quantum information technologies. Ultrafast shaping of exciton-polariton condensates enables applications for classical and quantum logic devices and provides insights into the physics of nonequilibrium quantum condensates in solid-state.

 The Drosophila proventriculus is a bulb-shaped structure at the juncture of the foregut and the midgut, which plays important roles in ingestion, peritrophic membrane synthesis, and the immune response to oral pathogens. A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endocycle throughout the fly’s life, increasing their ploidy and size, while at the same time cells in this tissue are lost into the gut lumen as the fly ages. Functionally, these cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when their endocycling is experimentally increased or decreased, there is a concomitant change in ploidy, tissue size, and peritrophic membrane synthesis. Further, we show that inhibition of endocycling makes flies more susceptible to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function in the face of cell loss due to aging or tissue damage. This study demonstrates that the Drosophila proventriculus, the structure at the anterior of gut that synthesizes the peritrophic membrane, lacks stem cells but undergoes continual endocycling to compensate for cells loss during aging or damage."

 The SEL1L-HRD1 complex represents the most conserved branch of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), a critical quality-control pathway that clears misfolded ER proteins. However, the molecular organization and pathogenic mechanisms of mammalian ERAD have remained elusive. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the core mammalian ERAD complex, comprising the ER lectin OS9, SEL1L, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1. The structure, validated by mutagenesis and crosslinking assays, reveals a dimeric assembly of the core complex in which SEL1L and OS9 form a claw-like configuration in the ER lumen that mediates substrate engagement, while HRD1 dimerizes within the membrane that may facilitate substrate translocation. Furthermore, pathogenic SEL1L mutations at the SEL1L-OS9 (Gly585Asp) and SEL1L-HRD1 (Ser658Pro) interfaces disrupt complex formation and impair ERAD activity. A newly identified disease-associated HRD1 variant (Ala91Asp), located in transmembrane helix 3, impairs HRD1 dimerization and substrate processing. These findings provide structural and functional insights for mammalian SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD and elucidate how mutations destabilizing this machinery contribute to human disease.

Here, the authors investigate the origin of the kink and identify the charge transport phenomena that is impacted. 
 Figures of merit are used to translate science to technology. For organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs), the product of mobility and volumetric capacitance, i.e., the µC* product, is the figure of merit used to guide the development of technologies ranging from bioelectronics to neuromorphics. While organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are used extensively to measure the µC* product, if there is a kink in the transistor current, then the µC* product is overestimated. Here, we show that the origin of the kink is a change in the rate with which the ions diffuse into the channel. We also discover that the OECT channel geometry has an unprecedented role on how the ions are distributed within the OMIEC. Finally, we observe that electronic charge carriers are first be injected and drift in the OMIEC, before ions can drift from the electrolyte into the OMIEC. Overall, the diverse charge transport phenomena identified here are essential for understanding the complexities of integrating novel OMIECs into traditional device structures, providing the key information needed to realize their promising application potential.

Here, authors demonstrate the topological resilience of classical and quantum optical skyrmions transmitted through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence. 
 The degradation of classical and quantum structured light induced by complex media, such as atmospheric turbulence, constitutes a critical barrier to its practical implementation in communication, energy transport, imaging and sensing. Here we construct both classical and quantum optical skyrmions and transmit them through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence, revealing the embedded topological resilience of their structure. For nonlocal quantum skyrmions, we show that although photon entanglement rapidly degrades, the topological characteristics of the states remain stable. Similarly, while the vectorial structure of local classical skyrmions is strongly distorted by the medium, their topology is preserved across a wide range of turbulence strengths. Our experimental results are supported by rigorous analytical and numerical modelling, validating that the quantum-classical equivalence of the topological behaviour is due to the non-separability of the states and the one-sided nature of the channel. This equivalence enables robust information transport in noisy environments, opening pathways for resilient terrestrial and satellite-to-ground communication.

 Elemental sulfur (S8), an abundant petroleum byproduct, is leveraged as a linchpin monomer in an organobase-catalyzed step-growth addition polymerization with dithiols and diacrylates at ambient temperature. This method enables the scalable synthesis of poly(ester disulfide)s—featuring alternating ester and disulfide linkages—with exceptional atom economy ( > 95% yield), Mn up to 42.0 kDa, and dual functionality: biodegradable ester units and stimuli-responsive disulfides. Mechanistic studies reveal a chemoselective three-component coupling involving S8 ring-opening, disulfide anion formation, and Michael addition, quantitatively generating symmetric and asymmetric disulfides in near-equimolar ratios. Thermal and mechanical characterizations of the poly(ester disulfide)s reveal programmable properties: High thermal stability (Td,5% = 248–281 °C), tunable phase behavior (amorphous Tg = −64 °C to semicrystalline Tm = 142 °C), and reductive degradation. By overcoming traditional limitations of harsh conditions and monomer scope, this strategy establishes S8 as a versatile feedstock for functional polymers, opening avenues for dynamic materials in biomedicine and environmental remediation.

 The uneven detection of prebiotic organic compounds in meteorites—where amino acids and nucleobases are commonly identified but sugars remain rare and poorly characterized—limits our understanding of extraterrestrial organic chemistry. This discrepancy is striking given that laboratory simulations of interstellar ice chemistry readily produce complex sugars. Here we report the simultaneous analysis of sugar and amino acid enantiomers in a meteorite sample. Multiple aldoses were detected in the Orgueil meteorite, including ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, and the ketopentose ribulose, several of which display near-racemic distributions consistent with an extraterrestrial origin. Recovery experiments demonstrate that sugar abundances are severely underestimated. Despite this limitation, pentose abundances are comparable to those of some C4–C5 amino acid enantiomers, implying higher true concentrations. These results indicate efficient abiotic sugar formation in space and suggest that meteorites may have delivered a broader range of prebiotically relevant sugars to early Earth than previously recognized.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the growing threat of zoonotic diseases, often exacerbated by land-use changes such as deforestation and habitat fragmentation. We conducted a systematic literature review (2000–2024) to assess how different types of land-use change affect zoonotic disease transmission, summarizing key findings and trends in geographic focus on the vectors/hosts/reservoirs and pathogens studied, in addition to identifying research gaps. We also evaluated the potential of restoration interventions to mitigate disease risks. Our analysis shows that land-use changes such as deforestation and urbanization often increase transmission risks, particularly for diseases transmitted by mosquitos and rodents, while some restoration strategies (for example, reforestation and wetland conservation) can reduce these risks. However, effects vary by disease group and region. The literature remains geographically biased, with most studies concentrated in wealthier regions despite higher disease burdens in low-income areas. We propose 50 high-priority locations, primarily in Western Africa and Southeast Asia, for future research. Our findings are available through an open-access online atlas, which includes supporting case studies and policy briefs to inform One Health-oriented restoration planning.

 The excessive use of antimicrobials has led to increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance that can spread between livestock, humans and the environment, with important One Health implications. Antimicrobial use in the livestock sector represents 73% of global antimicrobial consumption, yet how such antimicrobial use is embedded within international trade and global production networks remains unclear. Here we quantify global antimicrobial footprints and trace them through global supply chains from 2010 to 2020. Global livestock antimicrobial footprints peaked at 118.6 kilotons (kt) in 2013, then fell to 84.0 kt by 2020. China and the USA contributed nearly 60% of the global antimicrobial footprint. Most use remained in domestically produced goods, yet the trade-embodied share rose from 16% to 20%, signalling growing cross-border spillovers. Developed economies showed higher per capita use via trade, whereas developing economies’ use was concentrated in local production. Brazil surpassed China as the largest exporter of antimicrobials used in livestock production by 2020. Intriguingly, non-food products, particularly the clothing, services and manufacturing sectors, account for half of the trade-embodied antimicrobial footprint. Thus, global spillover of the effects of antimicrobial use extends well beyond the food system thus requiring policymakers to broaden their focus to better address antimicrobial resistance threats.

 Ocean ecosystems are undergoing accelerating disruption from human impacts such as climate change. Warming ocean temperatures drive pathogenic outbreaks, increase harmful algal blooms and cause coral stress. These can have serious consequences for marine ecosystems, human health and the aquaculture industry, representing a critical One Health issue. Monitoring key marine species offers valuable insights, but current methods are resource-intensive, low-resolution and unsuitable for frequent deployment. Here we introduce a low-cost, field-deployable CRISPR biosensing platform for detecting marine organismal DNA and RNA. Harnessing the programmability of CRISPR diagnostics for environmental biosurveillance, we demonstrate versatility across three climate-linked indicators: Vibrio spp., Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and heat-stressed corals. Portable 3D-printed processor and incubator devices enable direct processing of filter-captured samples with temperature control. Field readiness is reinforced by lyophilized reagents, lateral flow readouts, dropper-based handling and a two-step multiplexed workflow, delivering results within 1 hour without laboratory instruments. Benchmarking with authentic pathogens and environmental seawater confirmed seawater tolerance and robust detection of 108 colony-forming units per filter of Vibrio pathogens, equivalent to 102 copies per microlitre for 1 litre of filtered sample. This decentralized platform reduces barriers to routine monitoring and can provide early warnings of ecosystem disturbances, while supporting One Health initiatives in the marine space.

 The Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) acts as Earth’s largest tropical heat reservoir; however, the mechanisms that drive orbital-scale sea surface salinity (SSS) variability remain unresolved, as traditional δ¹⁸O-based proxies conflate regional salinity with global ice-volume effects. Here, we present a 450 kyr SSS record from the WPWP using hydrogen isotope composition of alkenones (δDAlk)—a proxy isolating evaporation-precipitation balance—paired with isotope-enabled climate modeling. Our results reveal dominant precessional SSS variability, with maxima during boreal precession minima (Pmin) when intensified meridional insolation gradients strengthen Walker Circulation, enhance evaporation, and sustain La Niña-like conditions. The δDAlk record demonstrates that precession-driven ocean-atmosphere feedbacks govern 78% of SSS variability, and reconcile discrepancies in previous δ¹⁸O-based studies showing the significant influence of obliquity. Integration with climate simulations shows that precession-induced trade winds amplify saline water advection and evaporation, establishing a “salinification triad” that dominates WPWP hydroclimate. These findings redefine the WPWP as a precession-paced engine of tropical hydrology, suggesting that the low-latitude tropical hydrology is highly sensitive to insolation intensity and then regulates ENSO-monsoon interactions. By isolating orbital controls on salinity extremes, this work advances frameworks for projecting hydrological responses to anthropogenic warming, critical for regions reliant on monsoon rainfall, emphasizing the vulnerability of tropical hydrological extremes to orbital forcing."

 Due to its potentially life—threatening and devastating economic impacts, variability in the East Asian Summer Monsoon needs better understanding, more accurate simulation and improved prediction. Much of the current ability of long-range summer monsoon forecasts stems from the link to the preceding winter El Niño Southern Oscillation, but the mechanisms behind this lagged impact are not fully understood. In this study, a simple new mechanism is proposed, based on migrating Atmospheric Angular Momentum anomalies. The polewards migration of atmospheric angular momentum associated with winter El Niño is shown to impact the northwest Pacific anticyclone responsible for much of the year-to-year variability in the monsoon. Model forecasts of the summer monsoon are shown to have increased accuracy when this new mechanism is active, with the increase in the success rate of forecasts due to migrating angular momentum anomalies shown to be as large as the effect of El Niño itself."

 Marginal seas with pronounced stratification are susceptible to low dissolved oxygen concentrations, which can lead to hypoxia or anoxia below the pycnocline. In the Baltic Sea, the Major Baltic Inflows ventilate the deep basins while further strengthening stratification. It was suggested that the largest-ever measured Major Baltic Inflow, which occurred in 1951, triggered the deoxygenation of the central Baltic Sea because it significantly strengthened stratification. With the help of a coupled hydrodynamical-ecosystem numerical model, we conducted a couple of numerical experiments and statistically analyzed the hypoxic volume and stratification strength variability on multidecadal timescales. We demonstrate that, although it had some short-term influence, the Major Baltic Inflow in 1951 did not significantly impact the stratification or hypoxia in the Baltic Sea on longer timescales. We provide quantitative estimates of the Major Baltic Inflows’ influence on multidecadal variability of stratification and hypoxia in the central Baltic Sea basins.

 The outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle poses substantial risks to public health, economic sustainability of farming, and global food systems. Using a Computable General Equilibrium model, we simulate its short- to medium-term impacts on Gross Domestic Product and other macro-economic outcomes for the US and its main trading partners. We simulate impacts under the current situation and realistic and reasonable worst-case scenarios. We estimate domestic economic losses ranging between 0.06% and 0.9% of US GDP, with losses to the dairy sector ranging between 3.4% and 20.6%. Trading partners increase dairy production to compensate for the loss. Current government subsidies are about 1.2% (95% HDI: 1% to 1.4%) of output losses, and likely insufficient to incentivise farmers to step up surveillance and biosecurity for mitigating the possible emergence of H5N1 strains with pandemic potential into human populations.

 While microplastic impacts on aquatic and agricultural systems are well-documented, their impacts on forest ecosystems remain poorly understood. We assessed how microplastic addition affects rhizosphere soil properties and fine-root traits for ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations in a mixed temperate forest. In ECM-associated soils, microplastics increased nitrogen availability and nitrate reductase activity but decreased phosphorus and phosphatase activity; AM-associated soils showed the opposite pattern. Morphologically, ECM roots exhibited reduced branching but increased hyphal density and colonization. Conversely, AM roots displayed increased specific root length and tip density but decreased cortical thickness and tissue density. These divergent, mycorrhizal-specific responses suggest that increasing microplastic pollution may fundamentally alter nutrient cycling and species composition dynamics in temperate forests. After microplastic addition, rhizosphere nitrogen increased but phosphorus decreased in ectomycorrhizal trees, while arbuscular mycorrhizal trees showed an opposite trend of lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus in rhizosphere soil, based on a field study in Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, China."

 Achieving just, equitable, and effective sustainability transformations requires diverse social engagement. This paper identifies five key roles played by Indigenous Peoples and local communities as agents of transformative change: embodying sustainable lifeways, resisting harm and defending rights, extending their practices to influence broader systems, and offering foundational models for care-oriented economies and governance. Through illustrative examples, we show how Indigenous Peoples and local communities actively contribute to global transformation. We emphasize the importance of engaging with a wide range of actors in supporting, expanding, and deepening these contributions to realize meaningful, systemic change toward a sustainable and just future.

 Slope lineae are enigmatic, bright, and seemingly young features on Mercury. Past investigations hypothesized that lineae occurrence might be tied to volatile loss, analogous to hollows, but no systematic analysis has been conducted. Here, we use a deep learning-driven approach to map 402 slope lineae across the planet. Lineae seem to feature blue spectral slopes and tend to originate from hollows or bright, ‘hollow-like’ features located on the equator-facing walls of young impact craters that penetrated volcanic smooth plains, implying that lineae activity could be driven by heat loss, insolation, and the devolatilization of subsurface phases like sulfur. We do not observe any geomorphic lineae activity between 2011 and 2015, suggesting that activity occurs on timescales longer than ~4 years or below MESSENGER’s spatial resolution. Lineae activity as a geomorphic indicator of recent or ongoing volatile loss on Mercury represents a specific hypothesis that can be scrutinized by ESA/JAXA BepiColombo.

 Climate change increases risks to the operations and financial reliability of drinking water utilities across the United States (US). Here we develop a comparative climate risk index that includes hazard, vulnerability, and exposure components for 1455 medium and large municipal US drinking water utilities. We find that 67 million customers are serviced by utilities with higher climate risk. Drinking water utilities in the Western US have higher risk due to expected large changes in climate hazards, while utilities in the Northeast and Midwest have higher risk due to existing vulnerabilities and exposure. We use this climate risk index, along with an analysis of municipal bond official statements, to identify utilities in need of climate adaptation and resilience planning. Of the analyzed bonds, 36% were issued by high risk utilities and didn’t mention climate change. This work offers recommendations for multiple decision-makers, including utility customers, bond purchasers, and government agencies. 67 million customers across the US rely on drinking water utilities that face higher climate risk than accounted for, which exposes major gaps in climate adaptation and resilience planning, suggests an assessment of vulnerability, exposure, and hazards across 1,455 municipal utilities."

 Sudden detachments of entire glacier tongues are rare but potentially devastating events that remain poorly understood. Here, we report on an event that occurred in Tibet on November 1, 2022, with an ice volume of ~40 million cubic meters, ranking it among the largest recorded ice avalanches. Utilizing a broad array of satellite data and seismic signals, we reconstruct the motion of the source glacier leading to its failure and the large landscape changes caused by the avalanche. The lack of glacier advance during its acceleration phase suggests that a frozen terminus has played a key role in the evolution of the glacier failure by acting as a dam to the ice mass pushing from above and its potential water content. The dense coverage by satellite data reveals details of an exponential increase in glacier speeds, up to 46 m per day in the weeks and days prior to failure.
