10.1088/1748-9326/ad7c6b,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是热带气旋登陆后在陆地上的持续性，主要关注气旋登陆后土壤湿度和土地利用类型对气旋持续性的影响。研究使用了天气研究与预报模型中的欧拉水汽示踪剂工具，分析了印度次大陆不同区域和土地利用类型对气旋降水的贡献。研究发现，印度次大陆的蒸散量对气旋登陆后降水的贡献约为 30%，其中西北部和东北部的贡献最大。研究还发现，尽管改变了主要的土地覆盖类型，但低压系统仍然在陆地上持续存在，只是改变了降水的空间分布模式。研究结果表明，土壤湿度、海洋和大气过程在决定热带气旋在陆地上的持续性方面都起着重要作用。,"['tropical cyclone', 'land-atmosphere interaction', 'soil moisture', 'land use land cover', 'precipitation', 'evapotranspiration', 'Weather Research and Forecasting model', 'Eulerian water vapor tracer']",Ashish Navale;L Karthikeyan,Understanding tropical cyclone persistence over land: a case study of cyclone Gulab,"Tropical cyclone (TC) Gulab originated in the Bay of Bengal during the post-monsoon season of 2021. Following an unusual westward trajectory, TC Gulab made landfall on the east coast of India, traversed central India, and reintensified over the Arabian Sea into TC Shaheen. This study employed an online Eulerian water vapor tracer (WVT) tool embedded within the Weather Research and Forecasting model to investigate the role of land in terms of soil moisture (SM) and land use land cover (LULC) in persistence of TC Gulab over central India. We quantified the contributions of sub-regions and dominant LULC types within the Indian subcontinent to the precipitation associated with TC Gulab. Our findings indicate that evapotranspiration across the entire Indian subcontinent contributed approximately 30% to the post-landfall precipitation associated with TC Gulab. The highest contribution originated from the northwestern region, followed by the northeast. Croplands, the dominant LULC type, were the primary contributors, followed by forests. Despite changing the dominant land cover from cropland to forest, the low-pressure system persisted over land while altering the spatial patterns of precipitation. Sensitivity experiments demonstrated a linear decrease in precipitation originating from land with decreasing SM. Notably, there is a disproportionate decline in total precipitation with decreasing SM. Further analysis separating atmospheric vapor sources into land and ocean contributions using WVT revealed a compensatory mechanism. The contribution of oceanic vapor to atmospheric vapor over land increased when SM decreased due to increase in the latent heat over ocean. However, the total atmospheric vapor remained low, ultimately leading to a lower total precipitation. Although SM plays a role, our results highlight the importance of oceanic and atmospheric processes in determining TC persistence over land. This study offers valuable insights into the dynamics of land–atmosphere interactions during low-pressure systems of TCs."

Tropical homegardens, a form of agroforestry, may have the potential to align concurrent demands for biodiversity conservation and food security in urban environments. Nevertheless, this depends on land-use decision-making strategies that are enabled by household livelihood assets. We examined which livelihood assets are associated with homegarden agrobiodiversity and food availability and accessibility in Kerala, India, the nature of these associations, and whether they vary along urbanisation gradients using data from 304 homegardens. We observed higher plant species richness closer to the urban centre and in smaller homegardens. Meanwhile, yields and share of household food consumption from homegardens tend to be higher farther away from urban centres. Assets like fertilizer use, irrigation and kinship affiliation are positively associated with both homegarden agrobiodiversity and food outcomes. Conversely, homegarden size is negatively associated with biodiversity outcomes across urbanisation gradients and positively associated with yield outcomes furthest away from urban centre. Some assets like family labour and farming association membership were only positively associated with food outcomes, while others like external labour availability were positively associated only with plant diversity in the urban centre. Overall, synergies between homegarden agrobiodiversity and household food security requires inputs to natural processes, such as irrigation and soil fertility, and social processes like knowledge sharing and social cohesion, especially in urban peripheries. We emphasize the relevance of homegardens and enhancing livelihood assets for food-secure households in biodiverse urban environments."

To shed light on the specific roles of spray-mediated sensible and latent heat fluxes, we conducted sensitivity experiments with heat flux parameterizations. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion and variation of the spray-mediated sensible heat significantly reduce model errors when compared against dropsonde data. These findings uniquely quantify the pivotal role of spray-mediated sensible heat flux in accurately predicting hurricane rapid intensification compared to previous studies. Without sea spray processes, ocean-coupled model simulations could not reproduce the steep intensification rate observed in multi-case studies of four high-impact hurricanes. This study also highlights that dropsonde data, as well as directly observed flux, is useful in minimizing uncertainty in the flux parameterization used for hurricane simulations. In this paper, we show how spray-mediated heat flux affects hurricane energetics through turbulent heat exchange and subsequent humid air inflow through primary and secondary circulations. Our findings provide new insights into the transformative role of sea spray in turbulent heat exchange that drives rapid hurricane intensification."

This drought mainly struck Yunnan Province and surrounding regions (21°–30° N, 97°–106° E), with precipitation deficit lasting for about 8 months from Oct 2022 to May 2023. The area-mean precipitation and surface soil moisture in the study region during the drought were both the lowest recorded for the same period since 1950. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) also reached its lowest level since 1950 at −2.76. Quantitative analysis shows that precipitation deficit and potential evapotranspiration (PET) increase contributed 71.36%, and 28.64% to the SPEI, respectively. Of the raw contribution of PET, 7.05% can in turn be attributed to the changes in precipitation. Using data from the CMIP6 Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP), we found that anthropogenic forcing increased the likelihood of a PET anomaly such as the one during the drought by about 133 times, with a fraction of attributable risk (FAR) of 0.99 [0.98, 1.00]. For the precipitation anomaly, we obtained a FAR of 0.26 [−1.12, 0.70], suggesting that anthropogenic forcings may have little impact. The extreme drought also increased the risk of fires, with the Fire Weather Index reaching its second-highest value since 1950 and abnormally high burned areas observed by satellites."

Demonstrating the entire country of Norway and the 2020 Gjerdrum quick clay incident as a case study, we integrated the assessment of both direct and indirect exposure information of settlement-transportation systems and their daily 1 km-by-1 km susceptibility map, which were derived from the 68 934 mass movement incidents since 1957 and the connectivity information of 4778 settlements and 257 000 km road networks. Our findings achieved 86.25% accuracy, providing a distribution of improved susceptibility estimates and identifying critical settlements in near-real-time. By interacting the graphical representations of the shared causal drivers of susceptibility and the settlement-transportation system connectivity, our study extends our understanding of the exposure of multiple interacting settlements with a high granularity degree in a unified approach."

Using high-resolution (∼0.1° for the ocean) Community Earth System Model (CESM-HR) simulations under a high-carbon emission scenario, we investigate the role of mesoscale eddies in regulating the response of the Subantarctic Front (SAF) to global warming. The CESM-HR simulates more realistic oceanic fronts and mesoscale eddies in the Southern Ocean than a coarse-resolution (∼1° for the ocean) CESM. Under global warming, the SAF is projected to intensify. The mean flow temperature advection intensifies the front, whereas the mesoscale-eddy-induced temperature advection and atmospheric dampening play primary (∼67%) and secondary (∼28%) roles in counteracting the effect of mean flow temperature advection. Our study suggests the importance of mesoscale eddies on inhibiting the SAF intensification under global warming and necessity of mesoscale-eddy-resolving simulations for faithful projection of future climate changes in the Southern Ocean."

To analyses and map GF sites (GFs), the Daytime Approach for GF Investigation (DAFI), which is based on daytime data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat-8 satellite, has recently been developed. The GFs catalogue from the DAFI system, spanning over the years 2013–2021, represents the first worldwide GF product generated from mid-high spatial resolution data (30 m). The DAFI version 2 (v2), also including information from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Sentinel-2 satellites, already showed an improved capacity in the mapping of GFs over Iran and Iraq. In this work, the new catalogue arising from the porting of DAFI v2 at global scale is presented and discussed. By using a parallel workflow, based on a loop tiling scheme running in Google Earth Engine, DAFI v2 allowed us to extend the GF inventory globally up to 2023, by analyzing ∼4 million of OLI/OLI-2 (Collection 2) and MSI imagery. Results of this study show: (i) an increased DAFI v2 capacity, of about 41%, in detecting GFs compared to the previous DAFI version; (ii) a downward trend (∼4.6%) in terms of GF sites detected from 2021 to 2023. These findings demonstrated that DAFI v2, which will also include the estimates of radiative power at different spatial scales, may contribute in assessing and monitoring the GFs activities and in evaluating the effectiveness of the greenhouse gas-emission reduction strategies at global, continental, national and local scales."

We observed a stratospheric background period from 2013 to mid-2017, along with several perturbations from volcanic aerosols and wildfire-induced smoke. In summer, injected stratospheric aerosols are found to be captured by the Asian monsoon anticyclone, resulting in prolonged residence and regional transport in the mid-latitudes of East Asia. 
 This study analyzes the vertical distribution, optical properties, radiative forcing, and several perturbation events of stratospheric aerosols using observations from a ground-based polarization lidar in Wuhan (30.5° N, 114.4° E) from 2010 to 2021. The background stratospheric aerosol optical depth (sAOD) was 0.0044 ± 0.0019 at 532 nm, as calculated during a stratosphere-quiescent period from January 2013 to August 2017. In addition, several cases of volcanic aerosol and wildfire-induced smoke were observed. Volcanic aerosols from the Nabro (2011) and Raikoke (2019) eruptions (both in boreal summer) increased the sAOD to 2.9 times the background level. Tracers of smoke from the Canadian wildfire in the summer of 2017 were observed twice, at 19–21 km on 14–17 September and at 20–23 km on 28–31 October, with a plume-isolated aerosol optical depth (AOD) of 0.002–0.010 and a particle linear depolarization ratio δp of 0.14–0.18, indicating the dominance of non-aged smoke particles. During these summertime events, the injected stratospheric aerosols were captured by the large-scale Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA), confining the transport pathway to mid-latitude Asia. On 8–9 November 2020, smoke plumes originating from the California wildfire in October 2020 appeared at 16–17 km, with a mean δp of 0.13. Regarding seasonal variation, the sAOD in the cold half-year (0.0054) is 69 % larger than in the warm half-year (0.0032) due to stronger meridional transport of stratospheric aerosols from the tropics to middle latitudes. The stratospheric radiative forcing was −0.11 W m−2 during the stratosphere-quiescent period and increased to −0.31 W m−2 when volcanic aerosols were largely injected. These findings contribute to our understanding of the sources and transport patterns of stratospheric aerosols over mid-latitude Asia and serve as an important database for the validation of model outputs."

The standardised benchmarking framework is applied to assess model performance through both statistical and process-based metrics. Ultimately, we identify two independent model groups that are suitable for dynamical downscaling in the Southeast Asian region. 
 Downscaling global climate models (GCMs) provides crucial high-resolution data needed for informed decision-making at regional scales. However, there is no uniform approach to select the most suitable GCMs. Over Southeast Asia (SEA), observations are sparse and have large uncertainties, complicating GCM selection especially for rainfall. To guide this selection, we apply a standardised benchmarking framework to select CMIP6 GCMs for dynamical downscaling over SEA, addressing current observational limitations. This framework identifies fit-for-purpose models through a two-step process: (a) selecting models that meet minimum performance requirements in simulating the fundamental characteristics of rainfall (e.g. bias, spatial pattern, annual cycle and trend) and (b) selecting models from (a) to further assess whether key precipitation drivers (monsoon) and teleconnections from modes of variability are captured, i.e. the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). GCMs generally exhibit wet biases, particularly over the complex terrain of the Maritime Continent. Evaluations from the first step identify 19 out of 32 GCMs that meet our minimum performance expectations in simulating rainfall. These models also consistently capture atmospheric circulations and teleconnections with modes of variability over the region but overestimate their strength. Ultimately, we identify eight GCMs meeting our performance expectations. There are obvious, high-performing GCMs from allied modelling groups, highlighting the dependency of the subset of models identified from the framework. Therefore, further tests of model independence, data availability and future climate change spread are conducted, resulting in a final subset of two independent models that align with our a priori expectations for downscaling over the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment –Southeast Asia (CORDEX-SEA)."

Climate change and large‐scale ecological restoration programs have profoundly influenced vegetation greening and gross primary productivity (GPP) in China's drylands. However, the specific pathways through which climatic factors and vegetation greening influence GPP remain poorly understood. This study examines the spatiotemporal changes in GPP across China's drylands from 2001 to 2020 and investigates the direct and indirect effects of climatic factors and leaf area index (LAI) on GPP. The results reveal that the overall improvement in vegetation cover has positively increased GPP in these regions. Although the direct effects of climatic factors on GPP are minimal, they exert a substantial indirect effect by regulating vegetation growth, highlighting that LAI is a key intermediary in mediating the effects of climatic factors on GPP. Furthermore, these complex interactions vary significantly along the aridity gradient. This study emphasizes the necessity of comprehensively considering the intricate interactions among multiple climate and vegetation factors."

 In recent years, perovskite has been widely adopted in series-connected monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs) to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction solar cells. Perovskite/organic TSCs, comprising a wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cell (pero-SC) as the front cell and a narrow-bandgap organic solar cell (OSC) as the rear cell, have recently drawn attention owing to the good stability and potential high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1,2,3,4. However, WBG pero-SCs usually exhibit higher voltage losses than regular pero-SCs, which limits the performance of TSCs5,6. One of the major obstacles comes from interfacial recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface, and it is important to develop effective surface passivation strategies to pursue higher PCE of perovskite/organic TSCs7. Here we exploit a new surface passivator cyclohexane 1,4-diammonium diiodide (CyDAI2), which naturally contains two isomeric structures with ammonium groups on the same or opposite sides of the hexane ring (denoted as cis-CyDAI2 and trans-CyDAI2, respectively), and the two isomers demonstrate completely different surface interaction behaviors. The cis-CyDAI2 passivation treatment reduces the Quasi–Fermi level splitting (QFLS)–open circuit voltage (Voc) mismatch of the WBG pero-SCs with a bandgap of 1.88 eV and enhanced its Voc to 1.36 V. Combining the cis-CyDAI2 treated perovskite and the organic active layer with a narrow-bandgap of 1.24 eV, the constructed monolithic perovskite/organic TSC demonstrates a PCE of 26.4% (certified as 25.7%)."

 Perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have undergone a rapid development in the last decade. However, there is still a lack of systematic studies to investigate whether the empirical rules of working lifetime assessment used in silicon solar cells can be applied to pero-SCs. It is commonly believed that pero-SCs show enhanced stability under day/night cycling due to the reported self-healing effect in the dark.1,2 While we discovered that the degradation of highly efficient FAPbI3 pero-SCs is in fact much faster under natural day/night cycling mode, questioning the widely accepted approach to estimate the operational lifetime of pero-SCs based on continuous mode testing. We reveal the key factor to be the lattice strain caused by thermal expansion/shrinking of the perovskite during the operation, an effect that gradually relaxes under the continuous-illumination mode but cycles synchronously under the cycling mode.3,4 The periodic lattice strain under the cycling mode results in deep trap accumulation and chemical degradation during operation, decreasing the ion migration potential and hence the device lifetime.5 We introduce phenylselenenyl chloride (Ph-Se-Cl) to regulate the perovskite lattice strain during day/night cycling, which achieved the certified efficiency of 26.3% and a 10-time improved T80 lifetime under the cycling mode after the modification."

 The fabrication of scalable all-perovskite tandem solar cells is considered an attractive route to commercialize perovskite photovoltaic modules1. However, The certified efficiency of 1-cm2 scale all-perovskite tandem solar cells lags behind their small-area (~0.1 cm2) counterparts2,3. This performance deficit originates from inhomogeneity in wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at a large scale. The inhomogeneity is known to be introduced at the bottom interface and within the perovskite bulk itself4,5. Here we uncover another crucial source for the inhomogeneity – the top interface formed during the deposition of the electron transport layer (ETL, C60). Meanwhile, the poor ETL interface is also a significant limitation of device performance. We address this issue by introducing a mixture of 4-fluorophenethylamine (F-PEA) and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA) to create a tailored two-dimensional perovskite layer (TTDL), in which F-PEA forms a two-dimensional perovskite at the surface reducing contact losses and inhomogeneity, CF3-PA enhances charge extraction and transport. As a result, we demonstrate a high open-circuit voltage of 1.35 V and an efficiency of 20.5% in 1.77-eV WBG PSCs at a square centimeter scale. By stacking with a narrow-bandgap perovskite sub-cell, we report 1.05 cm2 all-perovskite tandem cells delivering 28.5% (certified 28.2%) efficiency, the highest among all reported so far. Our work showcases the importance of treating the top perovskite/ETL contact for upscaling perovskite solar cells."

Here, we report an effective method for producing high-quality, micron-thick formamidinium-based perovskite films by forming coherent grain boundaries, where high-Miller-index-oriented grains grow on the low-Miller-index-oriented grains in a stabilized atmosphere. The resulting micron-thick perovskite films, with enhanced grain boundaries and grains, showed stable material properties and outstanding optoelectronic performances. The small-area solar cells achieved efficiencies of 26.1%. The 1-square-centimeter devices and 5 cm × 5 cm minimodules delivered efficiencies of 24.3% and 21.4%, respectively.

Here, the authors regulate the charge transfer state disorder and rate of back charge transfer through a ternary system, achieving low non-radiative energy loss of 0.183 eV and device efficiency of 20.25%. 
 The high non-radiative energy loss is a bottleneck issue that impedes the improvement of organic solar cells. The formation of triplet exciton is thought to be the main source of the large non-radiative energy loss. Decreasing the rate of back charge transfer is considered as an effective approach to alleviate the relaxation of the charge-transfer state and the triplet exciton generation. Herein, we develops an efficient ternary system based on D18:N3-BO:F-BTA3 by regulating the charge-transfer state disorder and the rate of back charge transfer of the blend. With the addition of F-BTA3, a well-defined morphology with a more condensed molecular packing is obtained. Moreover, a reduced charge-transfer state disorder is demonstrated in the ternary blend, which decreases the rate of back charge transfer as well as the triplet exciton formation, and therefore hinders the non-radiative recombination pathways. Consequently, D18:N3-BO:F-BTA3-based device produces a low non-radiative energy loss of 0.183 eV and a record-high efficiency of 20.25%. This work not only points towards the significant role of the charge-transfer state disorder on the suppression of triplet exciton formation and the non-radiative energy loss, but also provides a valuable insight for enhancing the performance of OSCs. The high non-radiative energy loss is a bottleneck issue for efficient organic solar cells.

Here, authors report a redox-mediated decoupled seawater direct electrolysis strategy to suppress the chlorine electro-oxidation side reaction. 
 Seawater direct electrolysis (SDE) using renewable energy provides a sustainable pathway to harness abundant oceanic hydrogen resources. However, the side-reaction of the chlorine electro-oxidation reaction (ClOR) severely decreased direct electrolysis efficiency of seawater and gradually corrodes the anode. In this study, a redox-mediated strategy is introduced to suppress the ClOR, and a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis (DSDE) system incorporating a separate O2 evolution reactor is established. Ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]3−/4−) serves as an electron-mediator between the cell and the reactor, thereby enabling a more dynamically favorable half-reaction to supplant the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This alteration involves a straightforward, single-electron-transfer anodic reaction without gas precipitation and effectively eliminates the generation of chlorine-containing byproducts. By operating at low voltages (~1.37 V at 10 mA cm−2 and ~1.57 V at 100 mA cm−2) and maintaining stability even in a Cl−-saturated seawater electrolyte, this system has the potential of undergoing decoupled seawater electrolysis with zero chlorine emissions. Further improvements in the high-performance redox-mediators and catalysts can provide enhanced cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the DSDE system.

 This study aims to identify colorectal cancer (CRC)-related proteomic profiles and develop a prediction model for CRC onset by integrating proteomic profiles with genetic and non-genetic factors (QCancer-15) to improve the risk stratification and estimate of personalized initial screening age. Here, using a two-stage strategy, we prioritize 15 protein biomarkers as predictors to construct a protein risk score (ProS). The risk prediction model integrating proteomic profiles with polygenic risk score (PRS) and QCancer-15 risk score (QCancer-S) shows improved performance (C-statistic: 0.79 vs. 0.71, P = 4.94E–03 in training cohort; 0.75 vs 0.69, P = 5.49E–04 in validation cohort) and net benefit than QCancer-S alone. The combined model markedly stratifies the risk of CRC onset. Participants with high ProS, PRS, or combined risk score are proposed to start screening at age 46, 41, or before 40 years old. In this work, the integration of blood proteomics with PRS and QCancer-15 demonstrates improved performance for risk stratification and clinical implication for the derivation of risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening, which may contribute to the decision-making process for CRC screening.

 Maximizing materials utilization efficiency via enhancing their reconfigurability and multifunctionality offers a promising avenue in addressing the global challenges in sustainability. To this end, significant efforts have been made in developing reconfigurable multifunctional smart materials, which can exhibit remarkable behaviors such as morphing and self-healing. However, the difficulty in efficiently manipulating and controlling matter at the building block level with manageable cost and complexity, which is crucial to achieving superior responsiveness to environmental clues and stimuli, has significantly hindered the further development of such smart materials. Here we introduce a concept of Robo-Matter, which can be activated and controlled through external information exchange at the building block level, to enable a high-level of controllability, mutability and versatility for reconfigurable multifunctional smart materials. Using specially designed micro-robot building blocks with symmetry-breaking active motion modes, tunable anisotropic interactions, and interactive coupling with a programmable spatial-temporal dynamic light field, we demonstrate an emergent Robot-Matter duality, which enables a spectrum of desirable behaviors spanning from matter-like properties such as ultra-fast self-assembly and adaptivity, to robot-like properties including active force output, smart healing, smart morphing and infiltration.

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising cancer therapy; however, resistance frequently develops. To explore ICB resistance mechanisms, we develop Immunotherapy Resistance cell-cell Interaction Scanner (IRIS), a machine learning model aimed at identifying cell-type-specific tumor microenvironment ligand-receptor interactions relevant to ICB resistance. Applying IRIS to deconvolved transcriptomics data of the five largest melanoma ICB cohorts, we identify specific downregulated interactions, termed resistance downregulated interactions (RDI), as tumors develop resistance. These RDIs often involve chemokine signaling and offer a stronger predictive signal for ICB response compared to upregulated interactions or the state-of-the-art published transcriptomics biomarkers. Validation across multiple independent melanoma patient cohorts and modalities confirms that RDI activity is associated with CD8 + T cell infiltration and highly manifested in hot/brisk tumors. This study presents a strongly predictive ICB response biomarker, highlighting the key role of downregulating chemotaxis-associated ligand-receptor interactions in inhibiting lymphocyte infiltration in resistant tumors.

Incorporating this relationship into autumn phenology models enhances their prediction accuracy and reduces previously projected delays in autumn phenology. 
 Autumn phenology plays a critical role in shaping the carbon sequestration capacity of temperate forests. Notable local-scale variations in autumn phenology have drawn increasing attention recently, potentially introducing substantial uncertainty when predicting temperate forest productivity. Yet the underpinning mechanisms driving these variations remain inadequately elucidated. Here we observed significant and consistent relationships between canopy structure and autumn phenology across six temperate forest sites, induced by the regulation effect of canopy structure on microclimate conditions. Incorporating the identified ‘canopy structure–microclimate–autumn phenology’ pathway into existing autumn phenology models significantly improves the prediction accuracy and reduces the projected delay in the start of autumn over the remainder of the century. These findings offer a new perspective for interpreting the local variations of autumn phenology in temperate forests and emphasize the urgent need to integrate the identified pathway into the Earth system and vegetation models, especially considering the asynchronous changes of macroclimate and microclimate conditions. The authors demonstrate a significant influence of canopy structure on autumn phenology in temperate forests, mediated by microclimate regulation.

 The global mean surface temperature is widely studied to monitor climate change. A current debate centers around whether there has been a recent (post-1970s) surge/acceleration in the warming rate. Here we investigate whether an acceleration in the warming rate is detectable from a statistical perspective. We use changepoint models, which are statistical techniques specifically designed for identifying structural changes in time series. Four global mean surface temperature records over 1850–2023 are scrutinized within. Our results show limited evidence for a warming surge; in most surface temperature time series, no change in the warming rate beyond the 1970s is detected despite the breaking record temperatures observed in 2023. As such, we estimate the minimum changes in the warming trend required for a surge to be detectable. Across all datasets, an increase of at least 55% is needed for a warming surge to be detectable at the present time. Despite 2023’s record temperatures, there is no significant warming surge beyond the 1970s, and an increase of at least 55% across all datasets is required for a detectable warming surge at the present time, according to an analysis of four global mean temperature records from 1850–2023 using changepoint models and statistical techniques."

 Tropospheric ozone impacts health, climate, and ecosystems. Effective ozone mitigation policies are challenged by limited quantitative understanding of national versus transboundary contributions to surface ozone. This study uses a chemical transport model with a source apportionment algorithm to analyze ozone contributions across Europe from 2015 to 2017 during peak ozone season. We quantify country-level ozone production and imported ozone, distinguishing contributions from 35 European countries, neighboring countries, seas, and hemispheric influences. Results show substantial contributions from outside the 35 European countries, with hemispheric contributions playing a significant role. European contributions are crucial during high ozone episodes, especially from Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Poland, and Spain. Spain, northern Italy, and northwest France are identified as areas where national precursor reductions would be more effective in improving national air quality. Furthermore, 25 of the 35 European countries studied are net importers of cumulative ozone mass, with the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK acting as major exporters. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive air quality policies and cross-border cooperation.

 The split-window (SW) and temperature-and-emissivity separation (TES) algorithms have been widely used for land surface temperature (LST) estimation from thermal infrared (TIR) observations for various missions. However, the SW algorithm requires prior estimates of land surface emissivity (LSE). The TES algorithm encompasses an atmospheric correction module, which increases the complexity and uncertainty of operational LST retrieval. To address this, we proposed a split-window-driven temperature-and-emissivity separation (SWDTES) algorithm in this study to estimate LST and LSE simultaneously without the need of atmospheric correction by combining the respective advantages of SW and TES. The inputs to the SWDTES algorithm are largely simplified, which only requires atmospheric water vapor content (AWVC) apart from the top-of-atmosphere TIR radiance. The developed SWDTES algorithm was applied to the high spatial resolution Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) data from the newly launched Sustainable Development Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) mission, and its performance was assessed using the MODIS data and ground measurements. The cross validation shows that the correlation coefficient (r), bias and root mean square error (RMSE) between MODIS-converted LSE and retrieved LSE using the SWDTES algorithm for the nighttime case is 0.904, −0.033 and 0.038 for band 1; 0.677, −0.008 and 0.014 for band 2; and 0.576, −0.000 and 0.008 for band 3, indicating a good consistency between the two LSE estimates. In addition, the evaluation using ground measurements shows that the r, bias and RMSE between the in-situ LST and retrieved LST using the SWDTES algorithm are 0.99, −0.67 K and 2.10 K, respectively. Compared to the OSW and TES algorithms, the SWDTES algorithm reduces the RMSE by 0.34 K and 0.90 K, respectively, indicating an improvement in LST retrieval accuracy. We conclude that the proposed SWDTES algorithm can achieve high-accuracy and high-resolution LST retrieval from the SDGSAT-1 mission, supporting fine-scale applications in energy, water, and carbon cycle modeling."

 We have conducted a quantitative analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Seoul from September 2022 to June 2023, employing passive air samplers (PAS) at 25 sites and continuous monitoring at five photochemical assessment monitoring stations (PAMS). Comparing VOCs concentrations and compositions from PAS and PAMS during the same time periods, we found that most VOCs showed no significant difference (p-value >0.05) between the methods, except for olefins, which were overestimated by 24 % in passive sampling, confirming PAS as an effective tool for assessing the spatial distribution of VOCs species over large areas. Throughout Seoul, median values of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) concentrations collected with passive samplers remained stable with a standard deviation of 1.22 ppbv, typically ranging from 11 to 13 ppbv, except for an increase during winter in the southwestern regions of the city, where intense industrial and vehicular emissions are reported in the current Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS) emissions inventory. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis using the passive data revealed general consistency in the spatial distribution of area and road emissions when compared with CAPSS emission inventory, although localized discrepancies were observed. In quantitative assessments of TVOCs comparing PAS observations with emission-based models, modeled values were within 1.5 times the interquartile range of observed PAS concentrations over Seoul. However, the lack of detection of emission hotspots in southeastern Seoul in the PAS data, coupled with the omission of photochemical loss in our dispersion-only models, indicates that the current CAPSS emission inventory may significantly underestimate actual ambient VOCs levels, especially in summer."

 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are the largest source of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) globally. However, the complex interactions between marine and terrestrial BVOCs remain unclear, inhibiting our in-depth understanding of the SOA formation in the coastal areas and its environmental impacts. Here, we performed smog chamber experiments with mixed α-pinene (a typical monoterpene) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS, a typical marine emission BVOC) to investigate their possible interactions and subsequent SOA formation. It is found that DMS has a non-linear effect on SOA generation: The mass concentration and yield of SOA show increasing and then decreasing trends with the increase of the initial concentration of DMS. The increasing trend can be attributed to OH regeneration from isomerization of the CH3SCH2OO radical together with acid-catalyzed heterogeneous reactions by the oxidation of DMS, while the decreasing trend is explained by the less contribution of isomerization reaction and the high OH reactivity that inhibits the formation of low volatility products. The results from infrared spectra and mass spectra together reveal the contribution of sulfur-containing molecules in the mixed system. Moreover, the mass spectra results indicate that acidic products generated by DMS photooxidation enhance the O:C ratio, while organosulfates are produced to contribute to the formation of mixed SOA. In addition, the trends in relative abundance of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) with C8 - C10 multiple functional groups in different mixed systems agree well with the turning point of the SOA yield. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding binary or more complex systems in the atmosphere in the coastal areas."

 The transported dust particles significantly impact global weather and climate. Previous studies focused primarily on the physical and chemical properties of dust plumes, but the interaction mechanism between these dust plumes and background dust aerosols remains unclear. We explored this issue using in-situ observation data of the East Asia dust from the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) during January 2013. We identified a dust plume originating from the Gurbantunggut Desert, which triggered a four-day dust event with an average dust concentration of 67.2 μg m−3. Notably, this dust event led to a significant increase in mass scattering efficiencies of dust, shifting from an inverted U-shape to a continuously increasing pattern with wavelength. The enhanced dust mass scattering efficiency inhibited the development of the planetary boundary layer. These changes persisted for at least two weeks after the event, primarily due to the resuspension of deposited dust particles altering the size of background dust particle. Our findings highlight the ability of dust plumes to enhance the scattering efficiency of background dust aerosols and providing new insights into the complex interactions between dust and the atmosphere."

 The precipitation structures and microphysical characteristics of predecessor rain events (PREs) over the Yangtze River Delta area and related tropical cyclones (TCs) from 2014 to 2019 were investigated using Dual-frequency Precipitation radar data from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) for drop size distributions (DSDs). Results showed that the total mean rain rate of PREs was larger than that of TCs, primarily due to higher convective and stratiform rain rates, with enhanced fractional coverage of convective rain in PREs. Examination of microphysical characteristics revealed that a greater quantity of small-sized droplets and a smaller quantity of medium- as well as large-sized droplets contributed towards PREs in comparison with TCs. The conclusion still holds when partitioning DSDs based on different precipitation rate categories. Further investigation of DSDs using gamma functions illustrated that precipitation in PREs had lower average mass-weighted diameters (Dm) and enhanced normalized number concentration (Nw) compared with TCs; partitioning precipitation into convective and stratiform components illustrated a larger Dm and lower Nw in TCs than PREs. The analysis of microphysical and thermodynamical processes using the reanalysis data indicates that relatively intense convective activity with drier conditions may be favorable to enhancing raindrop growth through collision-coalescence processes, as a result of larger Dm in TCs than PREs. The empirical relations (Z–R algorithms) applied in different rain regimes (stratiform, convective, and total PREs) revealed significant diversities, relying on weather conditions and geographical locations.Plain language summaryThe Yangtze River Delta area is an important economic belt in China. Under climate change, observed frequent occurrences of weather extremes of heavy rainfall and tropical cyclones (TCs) exert adverse effects on economic development in this region. Thus, a deep understanding of the mechanism of TCs torrential rainfall in the Yangtze River Delta area is urgently necessary. In this study, we investigated the precipitation patterns and microphysical characteristics of predecessor rain events (PREs) in the Yangtze River Delta region, and their association with TCs in the South China Sea-Western North Pacific Ocean (SCS-WNPO) area from 2014 to 2019. We found that PREs had a higher total mean precipitation rate than TCs. Further examination using gamma functions demonstrated that PREs exhibited lower average mass-weighted diameters (Dm) and higher normalized intercept parameters (Nw) than TCs. This pattern persisted when distinguishing between convective and stratiform precipitation components. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because these results provide valuable insights into the distinct precipitation characteristics of PREs and TCs in the study region and contribute to a better understanding of tropical cyclone-related rainfall patterns, and act as a scientific basis for disaster mitigation."
