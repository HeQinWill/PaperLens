10.5194/acp-25-8805-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,"该研究论文探讨了亚洲人为硫化物气溶胶对厄尔尼诺-南方涛动（ENSO）与东亚冬季风（EAWM）之间联系的影响。研究发现，亚洲硫化物气溶胶的增加会加强ENSO与EAWM之间的联系。通过耦合模拟，气溶胶引起的广泛降温会影响热带太平洋的平均状态，从而增加ENSO的振幅，进而导致季风年际变率的增加。虽然该研究没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，但它关注的气溶胶类型（硫化物气溶胶）和气候现象（ENSO, EAWM）是大气成分分析和气候研究的重要组成部分，这些研究通常会利用卫星观测等遥感数据来验证和改进模型。","['sulfate aerosols', 'ENSO', 'East Asian winter monsoon', 'climate modeling', 'aerosol-climate interaction']",Zixuan Jia;Massimo A. Bollasina;Wenjun Zhang;Ying Xiang,Response of the link between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the East Asian winter monsoon to Asian anthropogenic sulfate aerosols,"Using multi-model mean data from regional aerosol perturbation experiments, we find that increased Asian sulfate aerosols strengthen the link between ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) and the East Asian winter monsoon. In coupled simulations, aerosol-induced broad cooling increases the ENSO amplitude by affecting the tropical Pacific mean state, contributing to the increase in monsoon interannual variability. These results provide important implications to reduce uncertainties in future projections of regional extreme variability. 
 We use coupled and atmosphere-only simulations from the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) to investigate the impacts of Asian anthropogenic sulfate aerosols on the link between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). In fully coupled simulations, aerosol-induced cooling extends southeastward to the Maritime Continent and the northwestern Pacific. Remotely, this broad cooling weakens the easterly trade winds over the central Pacific, which reduces the east–west equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature gradient. These changes contribute to increasing ENSO's amplitude by 17 %, mainly through strengthening the zonal wind forcing.  Concurrently, the El Niño-related warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and the ensuing Pacific–East Asia teleconnection pattern (i.e. the ENSO–EAWM link) intensify, leading to an increased EAWM amplitude by 18 % in the coupled simulations. Therefore, in response to the increasing frequency of El Niño and La Niña years under Asian sulfate aerosol forcing, the interannual variability of the EAWM increases, with more extreme EAWM years. The opposite variations in the interannual variability of the EAWM to Asian aerosols in atmosphere-only simulations (−19 %) further reflect the importance of ENSO-related atmosphere–ocean coupled processes. A better understanding of the changes in the year-to-year variability of the EAWM in response to aerosol forcing is critical to reducing uncertainties in future projections of variability of regional extremes, such as cold surges and flooding, which can cause large social and economic impacts on densely populated East Asia."

Wagner;Martin Schnaiter;Guanglang Xu;Franziska Rogge;Emma Järvinen,Light scattering and microphysical properties of atmospheric bullet rosette ice crystals,"Understanding the interaction between cirrus clouds and solar radiation is critical for modeling the Earth's climate. A common crystal type found in cirrus clouds is the bullet rosette. Here, atmospheric bullet rosettes measured from jet aircraft are analyzed for their morphological and radiative properties. Atmospheric bullet rosettes are found to be more morphologically complex than previously assumed. This complexity has a significant impact on their radiative properties. 
 Cirrus clouds play a critical role in the Earth's radiative budget. The extent of the radiative impact of cirrus clouds is governed by the physical properties of aspherical ice crystals. One of the most relevant cirrus ice crystal habits is a polycrystalline bullet rosette, where individual bullets radiate from the same nucleation point. Here, the link between the crystal morphology of atmospheric bullet rosettes and their radiative properties in the form of the asymmetry parameter (g) is experimentally investigated using correlated high-resolution in situ stereo images of individual rosettes and their corresponding angular scattering functions measured by the airborne Particle Habit Imaging and Polar Scattering (PHIPS) cloud probe. Bullet rosette stereo images are analyzed for their microphysical properties, including maximum dimension, bullet aspect ratio, number of bullets, projected area, bullet hollowness, derived mass, derived effective density, and derived terminal velocity, as well as their optical properties such as g and the optical complexity parameter. Results indicate that much lower g values represent real atmospheric bullet rosette crystals than what is expected by numerical calculations assuming solid or hollow bullets, indicating higher levels of crystal complexity than have been incorporated within previous bullet rosette ray-tracing studies. Measured g values herein have a direct impact on modeling the shortwave reflection of cirrus clouds, resulting in an increase in scaled optical depth by an average of 53 % in comparison to previously calculated g values. This study will provide a valuable in situ dataset that can be used as a basis for the development of future ice optical models."

Significant variations in BC and turbulent mixing occur mainly at night. Higher resolutions reduce BC overestimation due to enhanced mixing coefficients and vertical wind fluxes. Small-scale eddies at higher resolutions increase the BC lifetime and column concentrations. Land use and terrain variations across multiple resolutions affect turbulent mixing. 
 Air pollution in cities impacts public health and climate. Turbulent mixing is crucial in pollutant formation and dissipation, yet current atmospheric models struggle to accurately represent it. Turbulent mixing intensity varies with model resolution, which has rarely been analyzed. To investigate turbulent mixing variations at multiple resolutions and their implications for urban pollutant transport, we conducted experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) at resolutions of 25, 5, and 1 km. The simulated meteorological fields and black carbon (BC) concentrations are compared with observations. Differences in turbulent mixing across multiple resolutions are more pronounced at night, resulting in noticeable variations in BC concentrations. BC surface concentrations decrease as resolution increases from 25 to 5 km and further to 1 km, but they are similar at 5 and 1 km resolutions. Enhanced planetary boundary layer (PBL) mixing coefficients and vertical wind flux at higher resolutions reduce BC surface concentration overestimations. The 1 km resolution parameterized lower mixing coefficients than 5 km but resolved more small-scale eddies, leading to similar near-surface turbulent mixing at both resolutions, while the intensity at higher altitudes was greater at 1 km. This caused BC to be transported higher and farther, increasing its atmospheric lifetime and column concentrations. Variations in mixing coefficients are partly attributed to differences in land use and terrain, with higher resolutions providing more detailed information that enhances PBL mixing coefficients, while grid size remains crucial in regions with more gradual terrain and land use changes. This study interprets how turbulent mixing affects simulated urban pollutant diffusion at multiple resolutions."
10.5194/acp-25-8859-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了气候变化驱动的生物源排放如何抵消人为减排对中国珠江三角洲地区臭氧控制的影响。研究发现，气候变暖和植被变化导致该地区生物源挥发性有机化合物（BVOC）排放量显著增加，从而削弱了人为减排的效果，导致臭氧浓度升高。该研究使用了WRF-CMAQ模型进行模拟，分析了气候驱动的BVOC排放对臭氧形成的影响。虽然论文没有直接提及大气环境遥感技术，但其研究内容与空气质量监测、大气成分分析密切相关，因为这些技术可以用于监测臭氧和BVOC的浓度和分布，从而验证和补充模型模拟的结果。,"['Ozone (O3)', 'Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOC)', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Atmospheric Composition Analysis', 'Anthropogenic Emissions', 'Climate Change', 'WRF-CMAQ Model']",Nan Wang;Song Liu;Jiawei Xu;Yanyu Wang;Chun Li;Yuning Xie;Hua Lu;Fumo Yang,"Climate-driven biogenic emissions alleviate the impact of human-made emission reductions on O3 control in the Pearl River Delta region, southern China","We found that climate warming and changes in vegetation have increased biogenic volatile organic compound emissions in the Pearl River Delta region. These increasing natural emissions, mainly due to climate warming, are weakening the benefits of reducing human-made emissions through control, leading to higher ozone levels. This work helps us understand how climate change influences air quality and provides important insights for improving pollution control strategies in the future. 
 Ozone (O3) concentrations in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during summer are typically low and often overlooked. However, integrated observational data indicate a consistent increase in summer O3 levels over recent decades (+0.96 ppb yr−1), contradicting China's efforts to reduce anthropogenic emissions. Our dynamically calculated natural emissions show that biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions in the region significantly increased between 2001 and 2020, primarily due to climate change and alterations in vegetation cover, with climate-driven BVOC emissions accounting for approximately 80 % of the increase. Furthermore, parallel simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting–Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF–CMAQ) model indicate that climate-driven BVOC emissions, by enhancing atmospheric oxidative capacity and accelerating O3 formation, have weakened or even offset the benefits of anthropogenic emission reductions, contributing 6.2 ppb to O3 formation and leading to an unexpected rise in O3 levels. This study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms behind natural emissions in urban O3 formation under climate change and provides insights for future O3 pollution control strategies."

Hennigan;Bastian Stieger;Andreas Tilgner;Laurent Poulain;Dominik van Pinxteren;Gerald Spindler;Hartmut Herrmann,Climatology of aerosol pH and its controlling factors at the Melpitz continental background site in Central Europe,"In this work, we characterize trends in aerosol pH and its controlling factors during the period 2010–2019 at the Melpitz research station in eastern Germany. We find strong trends in aerosol pH and major inorganic species in response to changing emissions. We conduct a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the aerosol system and discuss implications for controlling particulate matter in the region. 
 Aerosol acidity has importance for the chemical and physical properties of atmospheric aerosol particles and for many processes that affect their transformation and fate. Here, we characterize trends in PM10 pH and its controlling factors during the period of 2010–2019 at the Melpitz research station in eastern Germany, a continental background site in Central Europe. Aerosol liquid water content associated with inorganic species decreased by 3.4 µgm-3a-1, corresponding to a 50 % decrease during the analysed time period, in response to decreasing sulfate and nitrate. Aerosol pH exhibited an increase of 0.06 units per year, a trend that was distinct from other regions. The factors controlling aerosol pH varied by season. Temperature, the most important factor driving pH variability overall, was most important in summer (responsible for 51 % of pH variability) and less important during spring and fall (22 % and 27 %, respectively). NH3, the second-most important factor contributing to pH variability overall (29 %), was most important during winter (38 %) and far less important during summer (15 %). Aerosol chemistry in Melpitz is influenced by the high buffering capacity contributed by NH4+/NH3 and, to a lesser degree, NO3-/HNO3. Thermodynamic analysis of the aerosol system shows that secondary inorganic aerosol formation is most frequently HNO3-limited, suggesting that factors that control NOx would be more effective than NH3 controls in reducing PM mass concentrations. However, the non-linear response of gas-phase HNO3 and aerosol NO3- to NOx emissions in the region, likely due to VOC controls on oxidant formation and subsequent impacts on NOx conversion to HNO3, highlights the challenge associated with the PM reductions needed to attain new air quality standards in this region."
10.5194/acp-25-8821-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文评论了一篇关于气候敏感性范围确定性的观点文章，重点在于平衡气候敏感性（ECS）的估计方法和不确定性。论文讨论了贝叶斯统计方法在ECS估计中的应用，并强调了气候模型中结构性不确定性（特别是热带变暖模式）对ECS估计的影响。虽然气候模型与大气环境相关，但该论文主要关注气候科学中的统计和建模方法，而非直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['climate sensitivity', 'equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)', 'climate models', 'Bayesian statistical methods', 'tropical warming patterns']",Nicholas Lewis,Comment on “Opinion: Can uncertainty in   climate sensitivity be narrowed further?”  by Sherwood and Forest (2024),"This comment shows that claims made in an opinion article that challenged a 2022 study by this comment's author, which found a narrower and lower climate sensitivity range than an influential 2020 study with the same lead author as the opinion article, were wrong and explains why the article's favoured subjective Bayesian statistical methods are unreliable. It also reviews the 2022 study's revisions to the 2020 study's methods and assumptions and discusses structural uncertainties in climate models. 
 This comment addresses assertions made by Sherwood and Forest (2024) (SF24) regarding the narrowing of the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). SF24 challenged a previous study by Lewis (2022) (L22) that found a narrower and substantially lower ECS level. This comment clarifies that, contrary to SF24's claims, L22 did not rule out a high ECS level based on historical evidence and did identify and correct errors in Sherwood et al. (2020), in particular in relation to its likelihood estimation; their method, ironically, substantially underestimated likelihood for their historical evidence at high ECS levels. It also appraises L22's revisions to S20's methods and input assumptions and considers how these have contributed to the lowering and narrowing of the ECS range. This comment also discusses the role of priors in Bayesian ECS estimation and explains why the subjective Bayesian approach favoured by SF24 can often produce unreliable inference for uncertain parameters such as ECS. Finally, the importance of considering structural uncertainties in climate models, particularly regarding tropical warming patterns, is extended beyond the points raised by SF24. Such uncertainties could affect ECS estimation, not only from historical period evidence, but also from climate process understanding and emergent constraints. They seem more likely to suggest that existing ECS estimates are too high rather than too low."

Passer;Mikael K. Witte;Patrick Y. Chuang,Aircraft evaluation of MODIS cloud drop number concentration retrievals,"One important property of a cloud is the concentration of cloud drops. This property is relevant to how the cloud interacts with sunlight and how easily the cloud forms precipitation. Measuring this property from satellite observations is one important source of data, but it does require making some assumptions. This study evaluates the accuracy of satellite-derived drop concentration by a comparison with aircraft measurements. 
 Cloud drop number concentration (Nd) can be retrieved through passive satellite observation. These retrievals are useful due to their wide spatial and temporal coverage. However, the accuracy of the retrieved values is not well understood. In this study, we seek to understand why the retrievals agree or disagree with in situ measurements by examining the various cloud properties that underlie the retrievals. To do so, we compare satellite Nd derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument with in situ aircraft measurements made using a phase Doppler interferometer on board three flight campaigns sampling marine stratocumulus clouds. Intercomparison of Nd values shows that the discrepancy between retrieved and in situ Nd can be ± 50 % or more. In the mean, there is evidence of an overestimation bias by MODIS retrievals, although the sample size is insufficient for statistical certainty. We find that MODIS Nd is best interpreted as representative of the mid-cloud region, as there is almost always a greater discrepancy from in situ values near the cloud top and cloud base. We also find evidence of cases where Nd is accurately retrieved but the effective radius is not, presumably due to offsetting errors in other retrieval parameters. Vertical profiles of the extinction coefficient β, liquid water content L, and effective radius re measured during sawtooth-pattern flight legs through the cloud top are also compared to implicit MODIS retrieval profiles. For the two cases with Nd agreement, all profiles match well. For the six cases with significant disagreement, there is no consistent underlying cause. The discrepancy originates from one of the following: (a) discrepancy in the re profile, (b) discrepancy in the β and L profiles, or (c) discrepancy in both."

Several modern instruments include AVHRR-heritage channels, but some corrections are necessary to account for some differences. We have simulated AVHRR data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIIRS) sensor on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar satellites. We find that methods based on machine learning are capable of performing these corrections. 
 The long series of multispectral measurements from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), which began in 1979, is now approaching its end, with the last remaining AVHRR sensor currently operating aboard EUMETSAT's Metop-C satellite. Several climate data records (CDRs) built on AVHRR data now face the end of their observational record. However, since many modern imagers contain AVHRR-heritage spectral channels, the potential for an extension of these AVHRR-based climate data records exists. This study investigates the possibility of simulating original National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-19 (NOAA-19) AVHRR channels from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Platform (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) radiances using collocated AVHRR–VIIRS datasets from 2012–2013. Spectral band adjustments (SBAs) were derived using linear regression and neural networks (NNs). The NN approach produced the best results, and separating daytime from night-time conditions when simulating AVHRR channel 3B at 3.7 µm was key. Furthermore, daytime radiance corrections in this channel must depend on actual surface and cloud reflectances to be realistic, which was achieved only through the NN approach.The cloud mask, cloud top height, and cloud phase products were produced from the simulated AVHRR radiances using the same retrieval methods for NOAA-19 data used to compile the CLARA-A3 CDR. CLARA-A3 is the third edition of the EUMETSAT Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF) CDR, with cloud parameters, surface albedo, surface radiation, and top of atmosphere (TOA) radiation products from AVHRR. Products were validated using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations–Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO–CALIOP) cloud products and agreed well with the original CLARA-A3 products, with the best results provided by the NN simulation approach. The NN-based approach best reproduced the corresponding products for cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CRE), liquid water path (LWP), and ice water path (IWP).The CLARA-A3 CDR will be complemented and extended with VIIRS-based products to cover the period 1979–2024 (46 years). This edition will be known as CLARA-A3.5. Future extensions and editions can follow a similar approach by applying the same radiance simulation method to collocated data from the Metop-C AVHRR and the Metop Second Generation (SG) METimage sensors, with the first satellite of the latter scheduled for launch in August 2025. The successful simulation of AVHRR radiances from METimage and VIIRS data enables the CLARA CDR extension for several decades."

Hayley,Compilation and analysis of thaw settlement test results: implications for prediction tools and stress–strain characterization in permafrost,"This study aims to improve understanding of thaw settlement, a common issue caused by climate change that affects infrastructure on permafrost. A dataset of thaw settlement test results was compiled from the literature and used to compare soil behaviour during thawing. The study also evaluates common prediction tools and identifies which methods most accurately estimate thaw settlement across soil types. 
 Climate change has already significantly impacted infrastructure built on permafrost with thaw settlement as the most frequently reported issue. By characterizing thaw settlement tests, an improved understanding of the thaw settlement properties of permafrost sediment can be obtained. Thaw settlement tests involve thawing permafrost samples under an initial load, followed by applying additional load to the thawed sample to characterize its volume change behaviour upon thawing. In the absence of a standardized procedure for conducting thaw settlement tests, characterizing thaw settlement properties has been done using various methods in the existing literature; however, to date, these data have not been broadly compared. This is in part because they had not previously been compiled in a single dataset. This study presents a comprehensive dataset of thaw settlement test results digitized from published papers and reports. The data are standardized and stored in an open-source repository. Aggregating the data enabled a cross-comparison of thaw settlement properties for different soil types. This was achieved by constructing an idealized stress–strain curve for each test and deriving thaw settlement parameters from the curves. These parameters were then used to compare the thaw settlement behaviour of fine-grained, coarse-grained, and highly organic permafrost samples. Additionally, the compiled data were used to evaluate the effectiveness of various empirical tools developed to predict thaw strain from index properties. The predicted thaw strain values were compared with the measured thaw strains to determine which tool provided the most accurate and reliable predictions for each soil type. The results suggest that a correlation developed by Nixon and Ladanyi (1978) for estimating thaw strain based on frozen bulk density shows the smallest deviation from actual values and exhibits the least bias in its predictions. This dataset enhances understanding of thaw settlement behaviour and provides a basis for developing and improving empirical prediction tools. Additionally, it facilitates more consistent characterization of stress–strain response upon thawing, supporting future modelling efforts. While the dataset is a valuable foundation for preliminary analysis, its full utility is realized when combined with site-specific data. The dataset is accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15192404 (Mohammadi and Hayley, 2024c), and the results presented in this paper are based on version 1.2.1 of the dataset. While this dataset enhances preliminary assessment capabilities, it does not replace the need for site-specific investigations to accurately characterize local foundation conditions and stratigraphy."

Using satellite imagery, we mapped their distribution, finding most of them in southern Peru, above 4800 m a.s.l. and conditioned mainly by low temperature and precipitation. This dataset helps scientists to follow the evolution of permafrost and local planners to manage water resources and risks in the mountains. 
 Rock glaciers are key periglacial landforms in high mountain systems, serving as indicators of permafrost, contributors to mountain hydrology, and sentinels of climate change. Despite their scientific and practical importance, detailed knowledge of their distribution, characteristics, and dynamics in the Peruvian Andes remains limited. This study presents the Peruvian Rock Glacier Inventory (PRoGI v1.0), – a comprehensive, high-resolution inventory of rock glaciers covering the entire Peruvian Andes, encompassing their spatial distribution, morphological attributes, and topoclimatic controls. Unlike previous local-scale studies, PRoGI v1.0 provides national-scale coverage using standardized methods aligned with International Permafrost Association (IPA) guidelines and updated data. Using sub-meter satellite imagery (Bing Maps 2024 and Google Earth 2017) and IPA classification standards, we mapped 2338 rock glaciers with a total area of 94.09 ± 0.05 km². Approximately 31 % of these landforms were classified as active, 49 % as transitional, and 20 % as relict. They predominantly occur between ~4416 and 5783 m a.s.l. (mean elevation ~4999 m) on slopes averaging ~20.7° (range 7–37°). Spatially, rock glaciers are concentrated in the southern Peruvian Andes, with sparse distribution in central and northern Peru. Most have a southern to southwestern aspect (predominantly S, SW, and SE-facing), and the lower limit of permafrost (indicated by the lowest active rock glacier fronts) is ~3541 m a.s.l. Our inventory serves as a benchmark dataset that significantly advances the understanding and monitoring of mountain permafrost, and it provides a basis for assessing the hydrological importance of rock glaciers in the Peruvian Andes under climate change scenarios.

Our maps offer valuable insights for managing fragile alpine ecosystems under climate change. 
 Soil Micronutrients supply sustain critical ecological functions but exhibit poorly quantified distribution patterns in high-altitude ecosystems. This study bridges this knowledge gap through a large-scale investigation across the Tibetan Plateau, a cold-arid region where cryogenic weathering, aridity, and suppressed pedogenesis interact to govern microelement cycling. We selected 526 spatially representative sites spanning climatic and edaphic gradients, analyzing six microelements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Mo) alongside multi-factorial drivers (climate, vegetation, soil, topography, human disturbances, weathering proxies). Random Forest modeling was employed to quantify controls and generate high-resolution spatial maps. Key results reveal that pronounced regional heterogeneity driven primarily by moisture-related climatic variables (mean annual precipitation, aridity index), with secondary modulation from weathering intensity and vegetation factors. Element-specific spatial patterns were observed, with Fe enrichment in southeastern/southern plateaus, Mn gradients increasing southwestward and Zn hotspots in central-eastern and western marginal zones. The machine-learning derived maps with a 1-km resolution serve for benchmarking process-based microelement cycling models and rooting for sustainable ecosystem management under climate change."

To address this, we developed an improved processing framework that integrates flexible use of global gridded aerosol models better suited for coastal environments and incorporates tailored masking strategies. Based on this framework, we generated a high-quality Rrs dataset from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua observations, spanning 2003–2022 for the coastal waters of China and the United States (US)—two regions where complex water optics and frequent anthropogenic aerosols have long impeded retrieval accuracy and valid data yield. Compared to the NASA standard MODIS Aqua Rrs products (mean regression slope: 0.90 ± 0.06), the improved framework achieves higher accuracy and reduced overcorrection biases (slope: 1.00 ± 0.08) across eight bands, especially in the 488–555 nm range. The new dataset also yields significantly more valid retrievals, with regional mean increases of 56 % in the Chinese coastal waters and 18 % in the US coastal waters at 443 nm. Regional image analyses confirm its superior capability in preserving valid retrievals and resolving fine-scale spatial features in turbid nearshore waters. Preliminary spatiotemporal analyses further demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing long-term Rrs dynamics and trends. These results highlight the robustness of the improved framework and the practical utility of the new dataset for long-term monitoring of coastal water quality and ecosystem variability. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16413443 (Zhao et al., 2025)."

 Accurately estimating global land surface radiation [including downward shortwave radiation (SWIN), downward longwave radiation (LWIN), upward shortwave radiation (SWOUT), upward longwave radiation (LWOUT) and net radiation (Rn)] and heat fluxes [including latent heat flux (LE), soil heat flux (G) and sensible heat flux (H)] is essential for quantifying the exchange of radiation, heat and water between the land and atmosphere under global climate change.

Schneider,"COSP-RTTOV-1.0: flexible radiation diagnostics to enable new science applications in model evaluation, climate change detection, and satellite mission design","Satellites have observed Earth's emissions of infrared radiation since the 1970s. Because infrared wavelengths interact with the atmosphere in distinct ways, these observations contain information about Earth and the atmosphere. We present a tool that runs within Earth system models and produces output that can be directly compared with satellite measurements of infrared radiation. We then use this tool for climate model evaluation, climate change detection, and satellite mission design. 
 Infrared spectral radiation fields observed by satellites make up an information-rich, multi-decade record with continuous coverage of the entire planet. As direct observations, spectral radiation fields are also largely free of uncertainties that accumulate during geophysical retrieval and data assimilation processes. Comparing these direct observations with Earth system models (ESMs), however, is hindered by definitional differences between the radiation fields satellites observe and those generated by models. Here, we present a flexible, computationally efficient tool called COSP-RTTOV (Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package and Radiative Transfer for TOVS) for simulating satellite-like radiation fields within ESMs. Outputs from COSP-RTTOV are consistent with instrument spectral response functions, orbit sampling, and the physics of the host model. After validating COSP-RTTOV's performance, we demonstrate new constraints on model performance enabled by COSP-RTTOV. We show additional applications in climate change detection using the NASA Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) instrument and observing system simulation experiments using the NASA PREFIRE mission. In summary, COSP-RTTOV is a convenient tool for directly comparing satellite radiation observations with ESMs. It enables a wide range of scientific applications, especially when users desire to avoid the assumptions and uncertainties inherent in satellite-based retrievals of geophysical variables or in atmospheric reanalysis."

 We have developed an open-source ray-tracing tool for space geodetic techniques. The software uses the geometric optics approximation to calculate the signal travel time delay induced by the atmosphere between two given points. The software called DNS (“Direct Numerical Simulation of signal travel time delay”) is written in Fortran and uses OpenMP to speed up computation. The input to the ray-tracing tool is 3D pressure, temperature and humidity fields. The Earth's magnetic field and electron density field are optional. For the neutral atmosphere (troposphere) the software accepts the NetCDF files from the atmospheric reanalysis ERA5 and the mesoscale model WRF. For the ionosphere the software accepts electron density fields derived from IRI and NeQuick. We review the current status of the software and test its performance. For example, the one-to-one comparison with the open-source software RADIATE shows the high speed and precision of our ray-tracing tool. We also show how our tool can be used to study higher-order ionospheric effects (L-band frequencies). The two outstanding features of the ray-tracing tool compared to previous model developments, i.e. the ability to handle both the troposphere and the ionosphere and do so efficiently, make it perfectly suited for geoscientific applications."

The revised model, incorporating five additional HONO sources, effectively reproduced observed HONO concentrations and enhanced the model’s performance in simulating ozone and secondary particulate matter. The analysis revealed that the predominant source of HONO near the surface was heterogeneous reactions of NO2 on the ground surface, with sinks mainly consisting of vertical diffusion, dry deposition and photolysis. In the upper air layer (90–600 m), the primary sources of HONO included the homogeneous reaction of NO with OH, the heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on the aerosol surface and vertical diffusion, while the main sinks were photolysis and horizontal advection. This study provides valuable insights into the vertical distribution characteristics of HONO chemistry and underscores its critical influence on tropospheric air quality."

Additionally, ecotoxicological studies rarely consider environmentally relevant low concentrations of pesticides that may induce hormetic effects, whose potential to mitigate adverse impacts of global warming remains unknown. We sequentially exposed the freshwater rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus to a 12 h heat spike (32 °C) followed by a 36 h exposure to a hormetic concentration of the pesticide chlorpyrifos (50 μg/L) in the parental generation and assessed the effects in the parental and the unexposed (grand-)offspring generations. The heat spike negatively impacted fitness-related traits including survival, fecundity, and intrinsic population growth rate. In contrast, chlorpyrifos exposure elicited hormetic responses, shortening the time to the first brood and increasing the intrinsic population growth rate. Interestingly, the heat spike-induced adverse effects were counteracted by the hormetic response to chlorpyrifos: the heat spike-induced reductions in survival, fecundity, lifespan, the proportion of rotifers producing offspring, and the intrinsic population growth rate were no longer significant when combined with subsequent chlorpyrifos exposure. Moreover, both the main and interactive effects of the heat spike and chlorpyrifos were transmitted to the unexposed offspring and grand-offspring generations, providing the first evidence of transgenerational interactive effects between a pesticide and a climate change-related factor. Our findings underscore the critical role of hormetic and transgenerational effects in assessing pollutant impacts in a warming world."

Here, a Janus electrocatalytic membrane was fabricated to induce hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and atomic hydrogen (H*) simultaneously and tune redox processes via sequential tactics to achieve adaptable and ultrafast removal of diverse ECs. The Janus electrocatalytic carbon-fiber membrane with single-atom (SA) Fe and Ni anchored on two different sides, respectively, exhibited an excellent performance in the degradation of various ECs and treatment of the secondary effluent of pharmaceutical wastewater.

In the electrofiltration sequence of Side-Fe to -Ni, the •OH yield was enhanced due to the flow-enhanced mass transfer of Side-Fe-induced H2O2 to Side-Ni-induced H* and the subsequent reaction to form •OH, favoring electron-rich organic degradation. While in the opposite sequence, the process of H*-mediated reduction followed by •OH-mediated oxidation achieved thermodynamical superiority, favoring the degradation of ECs with electron-withdrawing groups.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, especially with respect to diet-induced susceptibility. In this study, we systematically investigated the neurotoxic effects of environmentally relevant TBBPA exposure in adult zebrafish under both normal-diet (ND) and high-fat-diet (HFD) conditions. Behavioral assessment and histopathology revealed that TBBPA induced pronounced anxiety-like behaviors and neuronal damage, with the HFD markedly augmenting these effects. Integrated multiomics analysis demonstrated that TBBPA exposure alters gut microbial composition, leading to substantial dysbiosis and a profound reduction of glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), a key secondary bile acid mediating gut-brain communication. Additionally, TBBPA induces mitochondrial dysfunction and activates inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammatory pathways in the brain. Notably, dietary GDCA supplementation effectively rescued TBBPA-induced behavioral deficits, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. To our knowledge, this study is the first to delineate a diet-dependent gut microbiota–bile acid–brain axis as a critical mediator of TBBPA-induced neurotoxicity, highlighting the significance of bile acid metabolism and the diet factor in maintaining neurophysiological homeostasis.

Comparative analysis revealed that PM2.5 in the TP shows weaker light absorption but comparable inherent oxidative potential (OP) to urban Beijing, suggesting substantial aerosol toxicity in the pristine TP. This difference can be explained by considering the roles of organic carbon (OC) and metals. PM2.5 in the TP contains both a greater proportion of OC and a higher degree of aging in its OC fraction, which not only influences light absorption and OP but also magnifies the effect of OC aging on these properties. Notably, in Nyingchi, a relatively pristine high-altitude region, the higher OC content demonstrates stronger OC-correlated light absorption and OP than Lhasa, where transition metals additionally contribute to OP.

Stadelmaier;Patrick Ludwig;Martin Kehl;Joaquim G. Pinto,Characterization of the Regional Climate and Large‐Scale Atmospheric Circulation in the Caspian Sea Region During the Last Glacial Maximum,"The Caspian Sea is the largest inland water body on Earth. Still, this region is often not considered in paleoclimate model analyses. In this study, we examine the climate of the Caspian Sea region during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and its driving large‐scale atmospheric circulation using data from two global climate models (AWI‐ESM‐1‐1LR and MPI‐ESM1.2‐LR) within the PMIP4 framework. We validate the simulation output against proxy data, including information derived from pollen, lake sediments, and loess deposits. Our results demonstrate that the global climate simulations align more closely with proxy data within the Caspian Sea region (mostly within one standard deviation) than the Mediterranean and Western Europe and can thus be further exploited. The subtropical jet stream is dominant in winter exhibiting higher wind speeds than in summer, where the jet stream undergoes a transition from a zonal structure under preindustrial conditions to a wave‐like pattern during the LGM. Furthermore, there is an increase in extratropical cyclone activity during the LGM. The analysis of the near‐surface circulation reveals the dominance of an anticyclonic flow in summer, which becomes even more frequent during the LGM (increase by up to 20%). The general characteristics of the rotational circulation weather types change toward an intensification during the LGM. Overall, the models demonstrate greater agreement at larger scales. However, to enable a more direct comparison with local proxy data, especially in the topographically complex region along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, we suggest a follow‐up study employing high‐resolution climate simulations."

Satellite remote sensing enables global‐scale CO2 monitoring, providing column‐averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2). Current missions such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐2 (OCO‐2) and Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) series provide high‐quality XCO2 but have many observation gaps because of narrow swath widths or cloud interference. To address this, we first propose a machine learning (ML) approach to estimate daily XCO2 (ML XCO2) at a 0.25° ${}^{\circ}$ resolution using OCO‐2, Sentinel‐5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, and ERA5 reanalysis data from May 2018 to December 2023. Validation against the Total Carbon Column Observing Network measurements shows high agreement, with an R2 of 0.95, a root mean square error of 1.05 ppm, and a mean absolute error of 0.78 ppm. The spatiotemporal variations in ML XCO2 are generally consistent with OCO‐2, GOSAT, and the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) XCO2. Notably, during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic in 2020, ML XCO2 estimates were more consistent with OCO‐2 and GOSAT XCO2 than CAMS XCO2, which was overestimated owing to unadjusted COVID‐19‐related CO2 emission reductions. The annual mean CO2 growth rates from ML XCO2 (2.065–2.735 ppm/year, 2019–2023) also agree with estimates from OCO‐2 and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration surface measurements, indicating the robustness of our approach. Our study demonstrates that the synergy between multiple‐satellite measurements enhances the spatial coverage of XCO2 and improves our understanding of the global carbon cycle."

The water vapor budget (WVB) within an atmospheric river enables us to understand moisture sources and sinks (horizontal flux, evaporation, and precipitation). Here, we applied our new WVB approach throughout the life cycle of the exceptional atmospheric river associated with Storm Dennis, which led to record‐breaking precipitation on 15 February 2020. We used the WRF model to simulate the event and performed two sets of sensitivity experiments: one reducing tropical moisture and the other modifying ocean evaporation to assess how these two main moisture sources affect the water vapor balance within the atmospheric river. We analyzed changes in the atmospheric river, cyclone, and associated precipitation at landfall in the sensitivity experiments. In the Dennis case study, tropical moisture played a prominent role in the early stages of the atmospheric river, whereas ocean evaporation became critical later. Additionally, the reduction of evaporation and also of tropical moisture is related to a decrease in precipitation over Europe. This study offers a new approach to understanding the evolution of atmospheric rivers and highlights the importance of different moisture processes. It provides a case study that helps unravel feedback mechanisms and the impact of different perturbations on the water vapor balance of atmospheric rivers."

It hosts ground and aircraft observations critical for monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the region that are yet to be fully utilized. To analyze these observations, we developed a high‐resolution CO2 model at smallest grid size of 1 × 1 km2 using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with GHGs fluxes (WRF‐GHG). The model used three different anthropogenic emission inventories: EAGrid (Japan region, 1 × 1 km2), EDGAR (0.1° × 0.1°), and EDGAR‐downscaled (0.01° × 0.1°) and was run for February and May 2018 and February 2020. At 1 × 1 km2 resolution, simulations resolve point‐source emission, which gradually attenuate as the model resolution is coarsened to 3 × 3, 9 × 9 or 27 × 27 km2; however, at surface sites, the 1 × 1 km2 model introduces transport errors weakening the correlation with observations compared to the 27 × 27 km2 model. CO2 simulations are found to be sensitive to planetary boundary layer dynamics on event basis. The 1 × 1 km2 model better reproduced the CO2 aircraft observations between 0 and 3 km compared to 27 × 27 km2 model, suggesting critical roles of improved representation of emission patterns and transport processes. We demonstrate that a systematic bias is introduced in the CO2 vertical distribution in the mid‐upper troposphere (altitude >3 km) when lateral and top boundary conditions are neglected in WRF‐GHG. These systematic biases in vertical distribution can have profound impact when comparing with remote sensing observations of total columns."

However, the impact of the explosion generated by them on cloud microphysics and rain formation remains highly uncertain. It is challenging to isolate the effects of the explosion on cloud development from the natural evolution of the cloud based on observational data, and there is a lack of high‐resolution cloud models capable of simulating these effects. This study investigates the impact of the explosion on the microphysics of a warm cumulus cloud, for the first time, by coupling an explosion model and a 3D large‐eddy simulation model offline. The results show that the rain forms faster due to the explosion, but the maximum rain intensity decreases. The mechanism responsible for this is that the explosion produces negatively biased pressure bands, which ultimately enhances the convergence and collisional‐coalescence process. The enhanced process increases the size and content of raindrops, triggering faster rain formation. However, faster rain formation reduces the transport of cloud droplets to higher levels and decreases the maximum rain intensity. The results provide new insights into how explosion affects cloud and rain processes, contributing to a better understanding of weather modification techniques."

 Developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for cost-effective proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is challenging1–3. Fe/N–C catalysts are among the most promising alternatives to the platinum group metal catalysts, but their activity and durability still cannot meet the performance criteria due to the strong adsorption of oxygenated reaction intermediates and the demetallization of Fe species caused by the Fenton reaction4–8. Here we design and develop a new type of Fe/N–C catalyst that is composed of numerous nanoprotrusions dispersed on two-dimensional carbon layers with single Fe-atom sites primarily embedded within the inner curved surface of the nanoprotrusions. The graphitized outer carbon layer of the nanoprotrusions can not only effectively weaken the binding strength of the oxygenated reaction intermediates, but also reduce the hydroxyl radical production rate. As a result, the Fe/N–C catalyst delivers one of the best-performing platinum group metal-free proton-exchange membrane fuel cell performances, achieving a record high power density of 0.75 W cm−2 under 1.0 bar H2–air with 86% activity retention after more than 300 hours of continuous operation.

 Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the largest reduced carbon reservoir in modern oceans1,2. Its dynamics regulate marine communities and atmospheric CO2 levels3,4, whereas 13C compositions track ecosystem structure and autotrophic metabolism5. However, the geologic history of marine DOC remains largely unconstrained6,7, limiting our ability to mechanistically reconstruct coupled ecological and biogeochemical evolution. Here we develop and validate a direct proxy for past DOC signatures using co-precipitated organic carbon in iron ooids. We apply this to 26 marine iron ooid-containing formations deposited over the past 1,650 million years to generate a data-based reconstruction of marine DOC signals since the Palaeoproterozoic. Our predicted DOC concentrations were near modern levels in the Palaeoproterozoic, then decreased by 90−99% in the Neoproterozoic before sharply rising in the Cambrian. We interpret these dynamics to reflect three distinct states. The occurrence of mostly small, single-celled organisms combined with severely hypoxic deep oceans, followed by larger, more complex organisms and little change in ocean oxygenation and finally continued organism growth and a transition to fully oxygenated oceans8,9. Furthermore, modern DOC is 13C-enriched relative to the Proterozoic, possibly because of changing autotrophic carbon-isotope fractionation driven by biological innovation. Our findings reflect connections between the carbon cycle, ocean oxygenation and the evolution of complex life.

 The time interval between about three and two million years ago is a critical period in human evolution—this is when the genera Homo and Paranthropus first appear in the fossil record and a possible ancestor of these genera, Australopithecus afarensis, disappears. In eastern Africa, attempts to test hypotheses about the adaptive contexts that led to these events are limited by a paucity of fossiliferous exposures that capture this interval. Here we describe the age, geologic context and dental morphology of new hominin fossils recovered from the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area, Ethiopia, which includes sediments from this critically underrepresented period. We report the presence of Homo at 2.78 and 2.59 million years ago and Australopithecus at 2.63 million years ago. Although the Australopithecus specimens cannot yet be identified to species level, their morphology differs from A. afarensis and Australopithecus garhi. These specimens suggest that Australopithecus and early Homo co-existed as two non-robust lineages in the Afar Region before 2.5 million years ago, and that the hominin fossil record is more diverse than previously known. Accordingly, there were as many as four hominin lineages living in eastern Africa between 3.0 and 2.5 million years ago: early Homo1, Paranthropus2, A. garhi3, and the newly discovered Ledi-Geraru Australopithecus.

 T cells respond to cytokines through receptor dimers that have been selected over the course of evolution to activate canonical JAK–STAT signalling and gene expression programs1. However, the potential combinatorial diversity of JAK–STAT receptor pairings can be expanded by exploring the untapped biology of alternative non-natural pairings. Here we exploited the common γ chain (γc) receptor as a shared signalling hub on T cells and enforced the expression of both natural and non-natural heterodimeric JAK–STAT receptor pairings using an orthogonal cytokine receptor platform2–4 to expand the γc signalling code. We tested receptors from γc cytokines as well as interferon, IL-10 and homodimeric receptor families that do not normally pair with γc or are not naturally expressed on T cells. These receptors simulated their natural counterparts but also induced contextually unique transcriptional programs. This led to distinct T cell fates in tumours, including myeloid-like T cells with phagocytic capacity driven by orthogonal GSCFR (oGCSFR), and type 2 cytotoxic T (TC2) and helper T (TH2) cell differentiation driven by orthogonal IL-4R (o4R). T cells with orthogonal IL-22R (o22R) and oGCSFR, neither of which are natively expressed on T cells, exhibited stem-like and exhaustion-resistant transcriptional and chromatin landscapes, enhancing anti-tumour properties. Non-native receptor pairings and their resultant JAK–STAT signals open a path to diversifying T cell states beyond those induced by natural cytokines.

 The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) class of drugs represents a remarkable advance in the treatment of patients with homologous recombination-deficient tumours, but resistance remains a challenge1–5. Although most research has focused on the downstream consequences of PARPi exposure to tackle resistance, the immediate effect of PARP inhibition on the chromatin environment and its contribution to PARPi toxicity remains elusive. Here we show that PARP inhibition induces histone release from the chromatin. This presents a vulnerability of PARPi-resistant cancer cells, which require histone homeostasis mechanisms to sustain elevated DNA replication rates and survival. Through functional genetic screens, we identified NASP as a key factor in maintaining the stability of evicted histones via its TPR motifs. Loss of NASP renders tumour cells hypersensitive to PARPi treatment in vitro and in vivo, impairs replication fork progression and elevates levels of replication-associated DNA damage. Moreover, NASP acts together with the INO80 complex and the chaperoning activity of PARP1 to ensure efficient histone turnover and prevent the accumulation of lethal DNA damage. Collectively, our work reports on histone eviction as an immediate cellular response to PARPi treatment and provides a promising avenue for targeting histone supply pathways to overcome PARPi resistance.

 Both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) accumulate in cancer cells during tumour development, fuelling clonal evolution. However, accurate estimation of clone-specific copy numbers from bulk DNA-sequencing data is challenging. Here we present allele-specific phylogenetic analysis of copy number alterations (ALPACA), a method to infer SNV and SCNA coevolution by leveraging phylogenetic trees reconstructed from multi-sample bulk tumour sequencing data using SNV frequencies. ALPACA estimates the SCNA evolution of simulated tumours with a higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods1–4. ALPACA uncovers loss-of-heterozygosity and amplification events in minor clones that may be missed using standard approaches and reveals the temporal order of somatic alterations. Analysing clone-specific copy numbers in TRACERx421 lung tumours5,6, we find evidence of increased chromosomal instability in metastasis-seeding clones and enrichment for losses affecting tumour suppressor genes and amplification affecting CCND1. Furthermore, we identify increased SCNA rates in both tumours with polyclonal metastatic dissemination and tumours with extrathoracic metastases, and an association between higher clone copy number diversity and reduced disease-free survival in patients with lung cancer. A study presents ALPACA, a computational method for inferring clone- and allele-specific copy numbers of individual clones from multi-sample bulk DNA-sequencing data, and demonstrates its use to study metastasis trajectories."

 Land has a vital role in sustaining human communities, nurturing diverse ecosystems and regulating the climate of our planet. As such, current rates of land degradation pose a major environmental and socioeconomic threat, driving climate change, biodiversity loss and social crises. Preventing and reversing land degradation are key objectives of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and are also fundamental for the other two Rio Conventions: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Here we argue that the targets of these conventions can only be met by ‘bending the curve’ of land degradation and that transforming food systems is fundamental for doing so. We showcase multiple actions for tackling land degradation that also yield climate and biodiversity benefits while fostering sustainable food systems that contribute to avoiding the risk of a global food crisis. We also propose ambitious 2050 targets for the three Rio Conventions related to land and food systems. Finally, we urge collective action to acknowledge the pivotal role of land in achieving the goals of the Rio Conventions and to embed food systems within intergovernmental agreements, enabling decisive progress on the complex and interconnected global crises that we face. The Rio Conventions’ objectives can be met by transforming food systems to bend the curve of land degradation."

 After fertilization, early embryos undergo dissolution of conventional chromatin organization, including topologically associating domains (TADs)1,2. Zygotic genome activation then commences amid unusually slow de novo establishment of three-dimensional chromatin architecture2. How chromatin organization is established and how it interplays with transcription in early mammalian embryos remain elusive. Here we show that CTCF occupies chromatin throughout mouse early development. By contrast, cohesin poorly binds chromatin in one-cell embryos, coinciding with TAD dissolution. Cohesin binding then progressively increases from two- to eight-cell embryos, accompanying TAD establishment. Unexpectedly, strong ‘genic cohesin islands’ (GCIs) emerge across gene bodies of active genes in this period. GCI genes enrich for cell identity and regulatory genes, display broad H3K4me3 at promoters, and exhibit strong binding of transcription factors and the cohesin loader NIPBL at nearby enhancers. We show that transcription is hyperactive in two- to eight-cell embryos and is required for GCI formation. Conversely, induced transcription can also create GCIs. Finally, GCIs can function as insulation boundaries and form contact domains with nearby CTCF sites, enhancing both the transcription levels and stability of GCI genes. These data reveal a hypertranscription state in early embryos that both shapes and is fostered by the three-dimensional genome organization, revealing an intimate interplay between chromatin structure and transcription.

 Acute tubular necrosis mediates acute kidney injury (AKI) and nephron loss1, the hallmark of end-stage renal disease2–4. For decades, it has been known that female kidneys are less sensitive to AKI5,6. Acute tubular necrosis involves dynamic cell death propagation by ferroptosis along the tubular compartment7,8. Here we demonstrate abrogated ferroptotic cell death propagation in female kidney tubules. 17β-oestradiol establishes an anti-ferroptotic state through non-genomic and genomic mechanisms. These include the potent direct inhibition of ferroptosis by hydroxyoestradiol derivatives, which function as radical trapping antioxidants, are present at high concentrations in kidney tubules and, when exogenously applied, protect male mice from AKI. In cells, the oxidized hydroxyoestradiols are recycled by FSP19,10, but FSP1-deficient female mice were not sensitive to AKI. At the genomic level, female ESR1-deficient kidney tubules partially lose their anti-ferroptotic capacity, similar to ovariectomized mice. While ESR1 promotes the anti-ferroptotic hydropersulfide system, male tubules express pro-ferroptotic proteins of the ether lipid pathway which are suppressed by ESR1 in female tissues until menopause. In summary, we identified non-genomic and genomic mechanisms that collectively explain ferroptosis resistance in female tubules and may function as therapeutic targets for male and postmenopausal female individuals. 17β-oestradiol establishes an anti-ferroptotic state in female kidney tubules."

 The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)—the leading pattern of climate variability driving changes over the North Pacific and surrounding continents—is now thought to be generated by processes internal to the climate system1,2. According to this paradigm, the characteristic, irregular oscillations of the PDO arise from a collection of mechanisms involving ocean and atmosphere interactions in the North and tropical Pacific3–5. Recent variations in the coupled ocean–atmosphere system, such as the 2015 El Niño, ought to have shifted the PDO into its positive phase6. Yet, the PDO has been locked in a consistent downward trend for more than three decades, remanding nearby regions to a steady set of climate impacts. Here we show that the main multidecadal variations in the PDO index during the twentieth century, including the ongoing, decades-long negative trend, were largely driven by human emissions of aerosols and greenhouse gases rather than internal processes. This anthropogenic influence was previously undetected because the current generation of climate models systematically underestimate the amplitude of forced climate variability. A new attribution technique that statistically corrects for this error suggests that observed PDO impacts—including the ongoing multidecadal drought in the western United States—can be largely attributed to human activity through externally forced changes in the PDO. These results indicate that we need to rethink the attribution and projection of multidecadal changes in regional climate.

 Unravelling how genomes are spatially organized and how their three-dimensional (3D) architecture drives cellular functions remains a major challenge in biology1,2. In bacteria, genomic DNA is compacted into a highly ordered, condensed state called nucleoid3–5. Despite progress in characterizing bacterial 3D genome architecture over recent decades6–8, the fine structure and functional organization of the nucleoid remain elusive due to low-resolution contact maps from methods such as Hi-C9–11. Here we developed an enhanced Micro-C chromosome conformation capture, achieving 10-base pair (bp) resolution. This ultra-high-resolution analysis reveals elemental spatial structures in the Escherichia coli nucleoid, including chromosomal hairpins (CHINs) and chromosomal hairpin domains (CHIDs). These structures, organized by histone-like proteins H-NS and StpA, have key roles in repressing horizontally transferred genes. Disruption of H-NS causes drastic reorganization of the 3D genome, decreasing CHINs and CHIDs, whereas removing both H-NS and StpA results in their complete disassembly, increased transcription of horizontally transferred genes and delayed growth. Similar effects are observed with netropsin, which competes with H-NS and StpA for AT-rich DNA binding. Interactions between CHINs further organize the genome into isolated loops, potentially insulating active operons. Our Micro-C analysis reveals that all actively transcribed genes form distinct operon-sized chromosomal interaction domains (OPCIDs) in a transcription-dependent manner. These structures appear as square patterns on Micro-C maps, reflecting continuous contacts throughout transcribed regions. This work unveils the fundamental structural elements of the E. coli nucleoid, highlighting their connection to nucleoid-associated proteins and transcription machinery.

 The emergence of animal phyla, each with their unique body plan, was a rapid event in the history of animal life, yet its genomic underpinnings are still poorly understood1. Here we investigate at the genomic, regulatory and cellular levels, the origin of one of the most distinctive animal phyla, the chaetognaths, whose organismal characteristics have historically complicated their phylogenetic placement2,3. We show that these characteristics are reflected at the cell-type level by the expression of genes that originated in the chaetognath lineage, contributing to adaptation to planktonic life at the sensory and structural levels4. Similarly to other members of gnathiferans (which also include rotifers and several other microscopic phyla)5,6, chaetognaths have undergone accelerated genomic evolution with gene loss and chromosomal fusions7,8. Furthermore, they secondarily duplicated thousands of genes9,10, without evidence for a whole-genome duplication, yielding, for instance, tandemly expanded Hox genes, as well as many phylum-specific genes. We also detected repeat-rich highly methylated neocentromeres and a simplified DNA methylation toolkit that is involved in mobile element repression rather than transcriptional control. Consistent with fossil evidence11,12, our observations suggest that chaetognaths emerged after a phase of morphological simplification through a reinvention of organ systems paralleled by massive genomic reorganization, explaining the uniqueness of their body plan.

 The development of high-energy lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is essential for advances in next-generation energy storage and electric vehicle technologies1–3. Nevertheless, the practical applications of LMBs are constrained by current electrolyte designs that inherently rely on dominant solvation structures, preventing transformative progress in performance optimization4,5. Here, we address this limitation through a delocalized electrolyte design that fosters a more disordered solvation microenvironment, thereby mitigating dynamic barriers and stabilizing interphases. The resulting delocalized electrolyte delivers notable energy densities of 604.2 Wh kg−1 in a 5.5-Ah LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (Ni90)||Li pouch cell with a lean electrolyte design (1.0 g Ah−1) and 618.2 Wh kg−1 in a 5.2-Ah Ni90||Li pouch cell with an ultralean electrolyte design (0.9 g Ah−1), maintaining significant cycle stability over 100 and 90 cycles, respectively.

 Intrinsically elastic thermoelectric generators with superior conformal coverage and shape adaptability are highly desirable for developing self-powered wearable electronics, soft bioelectronics and personal temperature regulators1,2. Until now, all reported high-performance thermoelectric materials have realized only flexibility, rather than elasticity3,4. Here we present one of the first n-type thermoelectric elastomers by integrating uniform bulk nanophase separation, thermally activated crosslinking and targeted doping into a single material. The thermoelectric elastomers could exhibit exceptional rubber-like recovery of up to 150% strains and high figure of merit values rivalling flexible inorganic materials even under mechanical deformations. Conventional wisdom suggests that incorporating insulating polymers should dilute the active component in organic thermoelectrics, resulting in lower performance. However, we demonstrate that carefully selected elastomers and dopants can promote the formation of uniformly distributed, elastomer-wrapped and heavily n-doped semiconducting polymer nanofibrils, leading to improved electrical conductivity and decreased thermal conductivity. These thermoelectric elastomers have the potential to make elastic thermoelectric generators in wearable applications much more conformable and efficient.

 Interactions between melting ice and a warming ocean drive the present-day retreat of tidewater glaciers of Greenland1–3, with consequences for both sea level rise4 and the global climate system5. Controlling glacier frontal ablation, these ice–ocean interactions involve chains of small-scale processes that link glacier calving—the detachment of icebergs6—and submarine melt to the broader fjord dynamics7,8. However, understanding these processes remains limited, in large part due to the challenge of making targeted observations in hazardous environments near calving fronts with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution9. Here we show that iceberg calving can act as a submarine melt amplifier through excitation of transient internal waves. Our observations are based on front-proximal submarine fibre sensing of the iceberg calving process chain. In this chain, calving initiates with persistent ice fracturing that coalesces into iceberg detachment, which in turn excites local tsunamis, internal gravity waves and transient currents at the ice front before the icebergs eventually decay into fragments. Our observations show previously unknown pathways in which tidewater glaciers interact with a warming ocean and help close the ice front ablation budget, which current models struggle to do10. These insights provide new process-scale understanding pertinent to retreating tidewater glaciers around the globe.

 While physical activity is critical to human health, most people do not meet recommended guidelines1,2. Built environments that are more walkable have the potential to increase activity across the population3–8. However, previous studies on the built environment and physical activity have led to mixed findings, possibly due to methodological limitations such as small cohorts, over-reliance on self-reported measures and cross-sectional designs5,7,9–11. Here we address these limitations by leveraging a large US cohort of smartphone users (N = 2,112,288) to evaluate within-person longitudinal behaviour changes that occurred over 248,266 days of objectively measured physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities. By analysing the results of this natural experiment, which exposed individuals to differing built environments, we find that increases (decreases) in walkability are associated with significant increases (decreases) in physical activity after relocation. For example, moving from a less walkable (25th percentile) city to a more walkable city (75th percentile) increased walking by 1,100 daily steps, on average. These changes hold across different genders, ages and body mass index values, and are sustained over 3 months. The added activity is predominantly composed of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which is linked to an array of associated health benefits1. Evidence against residential self-selection confounding is reported.

 Large earthquakes induce widespread landslides that fill river channels with sediment1,2, generating long-lasting fluvial hazards and reshaping mountain topography. However, riverine sediment fluxes after earthquakes remain poorly resolved, mostly because of a lack of data on bedload flux3,4. Here we construct a source-to-sink sediment budget following the 2008 Mw7.9 (where Mw is the moment magnitude) Wenchuan earthquake in the eastern Tibetan mountains. We measured sediment accumulation in a man-made reservoir downstream of the earthquake-affected region. Ten years after the earthquake, the Min Jiang River had exported about 9% of the sediment mass from earthquake-triggered landslides, with around 5.7 times increase in the total riverine sediment flux sustained over that time.

At the current pace, the river system will remove most Wenchuan landslide debris over centennial timescales. However, future sediment export rates are likely to vary because of changes on hillslopes (for example, revegetation) and in hydrology, sediment characteristics and transport processes. Our findings demonstrate a decadal bedload-dominated sediment pulse driven by earthquake-triggered landslides, suggesting that increased vulnerability to cascading hazards such as aggradation and flooding could persist for decades in populated downstream regions after a large earthquake.

We identify optimal structural parameters, including device size, membrane perforation density and distribution of the vertical ligaments that connect the two membranes, each as a function of atmospheric altitude. Targeting these optimal parameters, we fabricate structures with a heterogeneous ligament distribution, which efficiently compromises between structural rigidity and photophoretic performance. We measure how lofting forces generated by these structures depend on pressure using gases with three different molecular weights.

 Lignin is a natural plant polymer that accounts for about one-third of the organic carbon in the biosphere. Global warming has led to shrub encroachment and increased lignin input into peatlands. Generally, lignin is recalcitrant to microbial degradation in anoxic environments. Here we report methane production from lignin and its constituent monophenols in a flooded peatland in China based on microcosm experiments. Methane production was higher in the moderate shrub-covered peatland soils that have greater lignin contents compared with those of herb-covered soils. Adding lower contents of lignin and its monophenols promoted methane production of herb soil microcosms, and lignin contributed approximately 1.2–14.2% of the total methane emissions. Isotope tracing and dynamic metabolomic analyses revealed that the methoxy group of vanillin was first converted to methane, and then the aromatic ring carbons were fermented into CO2, acetate, propionate and (iso)butyrate. Lignin and its monophenols enriched the methylotrophic methanogens Methanomassiliicoccus and Methanosarcina, suggesting their involvement in methoxydotrophic methanogenesis. We suggest that lignin should not be overlooked as a source of methane in peatlands, especially given increasing shrub encroachment under global warming.

 Women with pre-existing sleep disturbance frequently experience postoperative sleep disturbance after surgery. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy of intraoperative adjunctive esketamine administration in the reduction of postoperative sleep disturbance following surgical abortion for women with pre-existing sleep disturbance. 204 women who had sleep disturbance and were scheduled for elective surgical abortion were randomized in a one-to-one allocation ratio to receive either a single intravenous injection of 0.2 mg/kg of esketamine or placebo (saline) immediately after the beginning of surgery (102 women allocated to each group).

Here, the authors report an organometallic approach for the synthesis of polyheterocyclic compounds from benzene. 
 The emerging field of dearomatization capitalizes on the synthetic potential of aromatic molecules. By using a transition metal to bind to two carbons of a benzene ring, the remaining four carbons are left available for the attachment of various chemical fragments. If these fragments are connected, this process could be a blueprint for synthesizing polycyclic architectures. The objective of this study is to develop a modular approach for creating classes of saturated polycyclic compounds that are currently underrepresented in the landscape of druggable chemical space. Herein, the phenyl group of methylphenylsulfone is coordinated to the tungsten complex {WTp(NO)(PMe3)}, largely interrupting its aromatic stabilization because of strong metal-to-ligand backbonding. Through the combination of ester enolate and amine addition reactions to the arene carbons, a wide array of chemically diverse polyheterocyclic systems is prepared. The tungsten stereogenic center influences the configurations of 3-5 stereocenters derived from the phenyl carbons.

Authors reveal that the polar smectic phase coexisting with a chiral ferroelectric nematic is itself helical, exhibits pseudo-ferrielectric switching, and shows both first- and second-order helix formation, with pre-transitional helices emerging in the nematic phase. 
 The recent discovery of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking has demonstrated the possibility of discovering the exotic textures of ferromagnetic systems in liquid crystalline fluid ferro-electrics. We show that the polar smectic mesophase exhibited by the first molecule discovered to exhibit a spontaneously chiral ferroelectric nematic phase is also helical has a strongly varied textural morphology depending in its thermal history and phase ordering. Electro-optic studies demonstrate that the two spontaneously chiral phases exhibit field-induced phase transitions. For the nematic variant, this process is threshold-less and has no hysteresis, while for the smectic it has a clear threshold and shows hysteresis meaning this phase exhibits pseudo-ferrielectric switching, the first of its kind for ferroelectric nematic like phases. We show that helix formation can be both 1st and 2nd order, but when it is 1st it is accompanied by pre-transitional helix formation extending from the phase boundary into the preceding ferroelectric nematic phase. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in ferroelectric nematic systems has opened new avenues for exploring exotic textures in liquid crystalline ferromagnets.

 The demand for high-performance permanent magnets continues to grow across a wide range of advanced technologies. However, conventional powder metallurgy routes for rare-earth magnets such as Sm–Co are limited by the intrinsic brittleness of the powders, reducing manufacturability and yield. Here, we report a single-step, solid-state processing method—friction consolidation (FC)—that enables simultaneous deformation, heating, and chemical transformation of brittle Sm–Co powders. Using commercial SmCo₅ powders containing Sm₂Co₇, FC induces a thermo-mechano-chemical pathway in which Sm₂Co₇ undergoes oxidation to form nanoscale SmCo(5–x) (where x < 1) and Sm₂O₃ phases. The heat generated from redox reactions and adiabatic shear deformation aids densification without requiring external thermal input. The extent of phase transformation is controlled by local strain and temperature during processing, with higher deformation levels leading to enhanced Sm₂Co₇ decomposition and improved saturation magnetization. This study demonstrates that FC offers a scalable, low-temperature route to consolidate brittle magnetic powders while refining their phase composition and microstructure. By tuning the starting powder chemistry and processing atmosphere, the approach reduces unwanted secondary phases and tailors the final magnetic response—offering a new pathway to fabricate high-performance Sm–Co magnets through a compact, energy-efficient process. Friction consolidation transforms brittle Sm–Co powders into dense magnets via shear-driven redox reactions and localized heating, enabling phase-selective refinement and enhanced magnetization in a single-step, low-temperature process."

This study finds that in the human-parasitic, skin-penetrating nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, skin penetration behavior is controlled by dopaminergic signaling. 
 Skin-penetrating nematodes are one of the most prevalent causes of disease worldwide. The World Health Organization has targeted these parasites for elimination by 2030, but the lack of preventative measures is a major obstacle to this goal. Infective larvae enter hosts through skin and blocking skin penetration could prevent infection. However, in order to prevent worm ingress via the skin, an understanding of the behavioral and neural mechanisms that drive skin penetration is required. Here, we describe the skin-penetration behavior of the human-infective threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis. We show that S. stercoralis engages in repeated cycles of pushing, puncturing, and crawling on the skin surface before penetrating. Pharmacological inhibition of dopamine signaling inhibits these behaviors in S. stercoralis and the human hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum, suggesting a critical role for dopamine signaling in driving skin penetration across distantly related nematodes. CRISPR-mediated disruption of dopamine biosynthesis and chemogenetic silencing of dopaminergic neurons also inhibit skin penetration. Finally, inactivation of the TRPN channel TRP-4, which is expressed in the dopaminergic neurons, blocks skin penetration. Our results suggest that drugs targeting TRP-4 and other nematode-specific components of the dopaminergic pathway could be developed into topical prophylactics that block skin penetration, thereby preventing infections.

 Fine aerosols (FA, radius <1 µm) may enhance cloud albedo for a given liquid water path (LWP), thereby partially offsetting greenhouse gas-induced warming. However, the aerosol-driven LWP adjustment is currently heavily debated due to conflicting observations. Here, we observationally found that both FA and coarse sea spray aerosols (CSA, radius > 1 µm) exhibit bidirectional regulation on LWP adjustments through precipitation-evaporation competition. In marine stratocumulus with moderate thickness, under dry cloud-top environments (RH < 20%) where evaporation dominates, FA decreases LWP by ~15% while CSA induces a slight ~8% increase. Conversely, in humid cloud-top environments (RH > 80%) favoring precipitation processes, the addition of FA more than doubles LWP, whereas the addition of CSA nearly halves it. Thin cloud LWP changes are primarily driven by droplet evaporation, while deep cloud LWP changes are dominated by precipitation. Our findings underscore the necessity to resolve precipitation-evaporation dynamics and opposing FA and CSA effects for credible aerosol-cloud interaction simulations."

 Accurate mapping of rice cultivation regions is essential for addressing global food challenges and developing climate adaptation strategies. In large-scale paddy rice mapping, obtaining sufficient training samples that capture the range of phenological variations is difficult. Cloud contamination and missing data complicate the collection of spatially and temporally complete observations for reliable rice mapping missions. This study introduces the Sentinel-1/-2 phenology-enhanced paddy rice (SPRC) mapping framework. Automated rice mapping is achieved by integrating Sentinel-2 phenology, Sentinel-1 V-shape features, Jeffries–Matusita distance, SPRC-based feature selection, and multi-layer probabilistic random forest classification with voting. The method demonstrated robust performance across varying weather conditions, achieving overall accuracy and F1 scores of 96.21 % and 96.66 in Heilongjiang Province (HLJ), China, and 95.76 % and 95.62 in Sakata (Sak), Yamagata, Japan, respectively, outperforming previous approaches. When compared with statistical data in HLJ, the maps exhibit a highly linear correlation and achieve an R2 value of 0.996, corresponding to a paddy rice area of just 1.1 % less than the reported average. The results reveal that the optimal time-series feature combinations for paddy rice mapping are strongly affected by spatial, temporal, and weather-related variations. The SPRC framework successfully produced rice maps for HLJ from 2019 to 2021 and for Sak in 2020. These findings illustrate the SPRC framework’s efficacy and precision in mapping paddy rice. The 3-year rice data are invaluable for food surveillance, regional agricultural monitoring, and policy-making."

 Despite considerable progress in air quality improvement, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution remains prevalent during the autumn and winter seasons in eastern Asian megacities: Beijing and Seoul. Here, we conducted synchronous field observations of PM2.5 chemical composition in Beijing and Seoul as part of the FRIEND Project, spanning the period from November 10th to December 10th, 2022 and we aimed to understand sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA) formation mechanism. The observations revealed that SNA, especially nitrate, were the primary contributor to particle matter pollution, accounting for 66 % and 76 % of PM2.5 in Beijing and Seoul, respectively, during pollution period (PM2.5>60 μg/m3). This indicated secondary inorganic aerosol formation was a key driver to force the urban fine particulate matter pollution in eastern Asian megacities. We found that the enhanced aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) during pollution episode facilitated SNA formation, then, contributing to the PM2.5 pollution. Such phenomenon was found in both cities. Aerosol acidity in Seoul was higher than that of in Beijing, leading to the different sulfate formation pathways. During observed pollution episode, liquid-phase sulfate was primarily formed through oxidation by transition metal ions (TMI) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Beijing, while in Seoul, sulfate was mainly formed through TMI-catalyzed oxidation. Nitrate primarily existed in the particulate phase during pollution period with ambient relative humidity larger than 60 % in Beijing. In contrast, around 20 % of nitrate was still in the gas phase in Seoul due to low aerosol pH. The sensitivity analysis of particulate matter to precursors in both cities highlighted the needs for differentiated management strategies to reduce NOx and NH3 emissions under varying ALWC and pH conditions."

 Ice core records from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) provide regional indicators of climatic and environmental changes and permit reconstruction of variations in human-made atmospheric pollutants during past hundreds of years. To comprehensively understand the TP's climate and environment history, we addressed the past climate and environmental changes reconstructed by ice core evidences, focusing on the variations of anthropogenic pollutants (e.g., mercury, black carbon). Since the 1980s, more than 40 ice cores across the TP have been drilled and some of them are investigated. Key benchmarker layers within the TP ice cores, such as peak values of ß-activity and tritium in 1963 AD, provide effective means for precise dating. The TP ice core reconstructions revealed the recent warming from the 1900s with different warming rate on the southern or northern TP, which were also affected by the large-scale atmospheric circulations. Emissions of human-related pollutants have seriously affected and altered Earth's environment and shown an increasing trend in the TP ice cores, especially since the 1950s. These existed variability of the reconstructions among ice cores in different TP regions was mainly controlled by interactions between the South Asian monsoon and westerly intensity. We also discussed the uncertainties of TP ice core dating currently, highlighting the recent rapid climate warming is threatening ice core archives.

However, with increasing efforts to mitigate climate change, the amount of anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere is expected to decrease in the future. This study aims at understanding how such a reduction in aerosol number concentration could affect the precipitation pattern of tropical cyclones through case studies of Typhoon Haikui and Koinu. The Thompson aerosol-aware microphysics scheme in the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is used, and the water-friendly aerosol number concentration is reduced by a factor of 100. For both tropical cyclones, a reduction in aerosol results in consistent expansion of precipitation area due to the enhanced warm rain process. However, the total precipitation of Koinu decreases while that of Haikui increases, depending on whether warm-rain or ice-phase processes dominate and whether upper-level convection is altered."

 Interactions between aerosols and the planetary boundary layer (PBL) play a crucial role in aggravating air quality and modulating regional climate. Despite intensive studies exploring the aerosol-PBL interaction predominantly focused on short-term haze events, uncertainties remain in understanding this interaction over longer timescales. To fill this gap, we investigate the long-term trends of extremely high and low PBL height (PBLH) across China, utilizing multi-observed datasets and sensitivity experiments conducted with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) with full chemistry. Here the extremely high (low) PBLH is defined as mean values of the daily PBLH higher (lower) than 90th (10th) percentile for each season. Our analysis reveals a significant increase in extremely high PBLH during the period 1979–2003 (seasonal ranging from +283.36 to +326.80 m/decade), followed by a pronounced reversal to declining trends during 2004–2016 (−321.45 to −178.83 m/decade). The trend shift is primarily driven by variations in surface sensible heat fluxes. Conversely, extremely low PBLH exhibits an obvious “negative to positive” trend shift around 2007 during 2000–2016, especially over Eastern and Central China (ECC) with a mean trend magnitude of +153.2 m/decade after 2007. The long-term trend of extremely low PBLH is dominated by changes in shortwave atmosphere absorption, which are influenced by the direct radiative effect of black carbon (BC) aerosols. Comparative simulations with BC's direct radiative effect turning on/off further demonstrate the reduced BC aerosols after 2007 diminishes the shortwave atmosphere absorption and enhances the surface shortwave radiation, thereby promoting an increase in extremely low PBLH, and vice versa. These findings highlight the distinct mechanisms influencing the long-term trend of extremely high and low PBLH over China, and provide new insights into the long-term variability of PBLH and its relationship with aerosols."

Over the past several decades, especially in northern mid-high latitudes (NMHL; above 48°N), OWASs have exhibited longer persistence, wider areal extent, and greater intensity than those developed solely over land. These landward migrations are associated with seasonal Atlantic teleconnection and Pacific circulation shift.

We use relocated aftershocks, geodetic measurements, and seismic waveform data to distinguish contributions from closely separated fault structures of the 2024Mw7.5 Noto earthquake. We find that the initial rupture triggered slip on a complex fault of a preceding swarm and led to bilateral slow rupture there. The earthquake ruptured two fault segments with contrasting dip angles along the eastern and western segments. Aftershocks continued to rupture the preexisting swarm faults. A delayed rupture occurred southwest of the hypocenter, implying that substantial resistance caused by a barrier temporally hindered rupture propagation. Additional stress from surrounding slip eventually overcame the strength of the barrier fault section, leading to a compound rupture. The mainshock triggered a small earthquake swarm, in which the relatively larger events were not followed by abundant aftershocks. Our findings demonstrate the influence of strong asperities and complex geometry in the progression of cascading ruptures."

Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of DAH using the chromosomal-level genome ofMenispermum canadense. Phylogenomic dating and synteny analyses reveal DAH evolution through tandem duplication of an ancestral flavonol synthase (FLS) gene, followed by neofunctionalization and gene loss events. Structural modeling, molecular dynamics, and site-directed mutagenesis identify mutations enabling the catalytic switch from FLS to DAH.

Here, we introduce Fourier synthesis optical diffraction tomography (FS-ODT), a quantitative phase imaging approach capable of recording the 3D refractive index at kilohertz rates. FS-ODT introduces computational strategies that multiplex tens of illumination angles in a single tomogram, markedly increasing the volumetric imaging rate. We validate FS-ODT on samples of known composition, hindered diffusion of colloids in solution, and the motility of bacterial swimmers. We also integrate FS-ODT into a multimodal microscope combining refractive index imaging with multicolor structured illumination microscopy. FS-ODT is a promising approach for unlocking imaging regimes that have been little explored, including understanding the physical interactions of colloids and microswimmers with their 3D environment and the interplay between these stimuli and the molecular response of biological systems."
10.1126/sciadv.aea0138,False,Science Advances,该研究论文主要关注物种分布范围的形状如何影响全球生物多样性热点地区的物种丰富度，特别是热带山区的鸟类。研究发现，物种分布范围的线性度和斑块性在地形复杂且季节性不明显的地区最为显著，例如安第斯山脉。这些分布范围的形状对物种丰富度的影响甚至超过了范围大小的影响。因此，该研究强调了基于生态位的过程对物种丰富度的贡献，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Jesper Sonne;Michael Krabbe Borregaard;Robert K. Colwell;Carsten Rahbek,Geographic range shapes influence species richness in global hotspots,"The extraordinary richness of species in tropical mountain regions is often attributed to aggregations of small-ranged species, allowing tight spatial packing of their ranges. However, ranges of species in these regions are also distinctly more patchy and elongated than those found in adjacent lowlands. Our global analysis of mainland birds demonstrates that these range shapes augment the spatial variation in species richness. Both the linearity and patchiness of species ranges are most pronounced in aseasonal and topographically complex regions, most notably in the tropical Andes, where these range shapes contribute more to the pattern of species richness than broad-scale variations in range size. Consequently, niche-based processes that govern the spatial configuration of habitats contribute to patterns of species richness in global hotspots over and above the processes that affect species richness through range sizes."

These are crucial in physics for understanding quantized bulk transport and exotic boundary effects of linear wave propagation in (meta-)materials. Beyond linear Hamiltonian systems, topological physics strives to characterize open (non-Hermitian) and interacting systems. Here, we establish a framework for the topological classification of driven-dissipative nonlinear systems by defining a graph index for their Floquet semiclassical equations of motion. Our index builds upon the topology of vector flows and encodes the particle-hole nature of excitations around all out-of-equilibrium stationary states. Thus, we uncover the topology of nonlinear resonator’s dynamics under external and parametric forcing. Our framework sheds light on the topology of driven-dissipative phases, including under- to overdamped responses and symmetry-broken phases linked to population inversion. We therefore expose the pervasive link between topology and nonlinear dynamics, with broad implications for interacting topological insulators, topological solitons, neuromorphic networks, and bosonic codes."

Their continuous insertion in the plasma membrane is balanced by constitutive and activity-dependent internalization, which is orchestrated by adaptor proteins recognizing semispecific motifs within the receptors’ intracellular regions. Here, we describe a complementary trafficking mechanism for G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that is evolutionary conserved and refined. This mechanism relies on the insertion of their amphipathic helix 8 into the inner leaflet of lipid membranes, orthogonal to the transmembrane helices. These amphipathic helices dictate subcellular localization of the receptors and autonomously drive their endocytosis by cooperative assembly and association with areas of high membrane curvature. The strength of helix 8 membrane insertion propensity quantitatively predicts the rate of constitutive internalization of GPCRs. This discovery advances our understanding of membrane protein trafficking and highlights a principle of receptor-lipid interactions that may have broad implications for cellular signaling and therapeutic targeting."

DMT is under clinical evaluation as a neuroprotective agent in poststroke recovery. Yet, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. In a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model, we previously showed that DMT reduces infarct volume. Here, we demonstrate that this effect is accompanied by reduction of cerebral edema, attenuated astrocyte dysfunction, and a shift in serum protein composition toward an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective state. DMT restored tight junction integrity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function in vitro and in vivo. DMT suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in brain endothelial cells and peripheral immune cells and reduced microglial activation via the sigma-1 receptor. Our findings prove that DMT mitigates a poststroke effect by stabilizing the BBB and reducing neuroinflammation. Such interactions of DMT with the vascular and immune systems can be leveraged to complement current, insufficient, stroke therapy."
