Kirchstetter,Emission factors and optical properties of black and brown carbon emitted at a mixed-conifer forest prescribed burn,"Prescribed burns are controlled fires used to prevent wildfires. Smoke emissions were measured to characterize emission factors and optical properties of black and brown soot particles. Brown particles were emitted at 7–14 times that of black particles and contributed 82 % of atmospheric absorption by particles for ultraviolet light and 23 % for total solar radiation. These findings will improve inventories and climate models for prescribed burns. 
 Prescribed burning is a fuel management practice employed globally that emits carbonaceous aerosols that affect human health and perturb the global climate system. Fuel-based black and brown carbon (BC and BrC) emission factors were calculated from ground and aloft smoke during prescribed burns at a mixed-conifer, montane forest site in the Sierra Nevada in California.  BC emission factors were 0.52 ± 0.42 and 1.0 ± 0.48 g kg−1 for the smoldering and flaming combustion phases. Modified combustion efficiency is a poor predictor of BC emission factor, in this study and published literature. We discuss limitations of using generalized BC to PM2.5 mass emission ratios to generate emission inventories; using BC emission factors measured in this study, we recommend BC to PM2.5 ratios of 0.7 % and 9.5 % for the smoldering and flaming combustion in mixed conifer prescribed burns. We apportioned the measured aerosol spectral absorption between BrC and BC and calculated absorption Ångström exponents (AAE) of 6.26 and 0.67, respectively. Using a BrC-specific absorption cross-section, we estimated BC concentrations and a smoldering combustion BrC emission factor of 7.0 ± 2.7 g kg−1, nearly 14 and 7 times greater than the smoldering and flaming BC emission factors. Furthermore, we estimate that BrC would account for 23 % and 82 %, respectively, of the solar radiation absorbed by the smoldering smoke in the atmosphere integrated over the solar spectrum (300–2500 nm) and in the UV spectrum (300–400 nm), indicating that BrC affects tropospheric photochemistry in addition to atmospheric warming."

Using nationwide observations (2013–2023) across China together with satellite data, we developed a new machine learning approach to decouple the impacts of emission controls and weather changes. Our results show that while emission reductions improved ozone in some regions, climate change is increasingly offsetting these gains, underscoring the need for joint air quality and climate actions. 
 Surface ozone, a major air pollutant with important implications for air quality, ecosystems, and climate, shows long-term trends shaped by both anthropogenic and climatic drivers. Here, we developed a machine learning-based approach, namely the fixed emission approximation (FEA), to decouple the effects of meteorological variability and anthropogenic emissions on summertime ozone trends in China under the clean air actions. Anthropogenic emissions drove an approximately +23.2 ± 1.1 µg m−3 increase in summer maximum daily 8 h average ozone during 2013–2017, followed by an approximately −4.6 ± 1.5 µg m−3 decrease between 2017 and 2020 in response to strengthened emission controls. In contrast, meteorological anomalies, including heatwaves and rainfall conditions, emerged as substantial drivers of ozone variability during 2020–2023. Satellite-derived formaldehyde-to-nitrogen dioxide ratios revealed widespread urban volatile organic compounds-limited regimes for ozone production, with a shift toward nitrogen oxides-limited sensitivity under influence of heatwaves. Extending the FEA framework to assess long-term climate influences from 1970 to 2023, we find that sustained climate warming has driven a substantial increase in urban summertime ozone in China. These results demonstrate that climate change was increasingly offsetting the benefits of emission reductions and highlight the need for integrated ozone mitigation strategies that jointly address emission controls and climate adaptation in a warming world."

Aerosol hygroscopic parameter γ increases from 2014 to 2017 and stabilizes at high levels afterwards, aligning with the changes in NO2-to-SO2 concentration ratio. Moreover, no evident differences are found across seasons, as well as between the free troposphere and boundary layer. 
 Lidar-derived particle backscatter coefficient is commonly used to assess air pollution levels; however, hygroscopic growth can amplify particle backscatter and hinder accurate assessment of particle concentration. This study investigated the hygroscopic growth characteristics of urban anthropogenic aerosols in Wuhan (30.5° N, 114.4° E), central China, using ground-based 532 nm polarization lidar observations during 2010–2024. A total of 192 cases were identified based on the following criteria: (1) the presence of a layer thicker than 300 m; (2) a lidar-derived backscatter coefficient that increases monotonically with simultaneously-measured relative humidity (RH) from radiosonde, and (3) limited variations in key meteorological parameters, including water vapor mixing ratio, potential temperature, and wind speed and direction. Using the Hänel parameterization method, the hygroscopic growth parameter γ was estimated as 0.62 (±0.24), corresponding to a backscatter coefficient enhancement factor of 2.36 at 85 % RH. No evident differences in γ were observed between the boundary layer (0.63 ± 0.25) and free troposphere (0.60 ± 0.24). The annual mean γ increased from 0.49 in 2015 to 0.63 in 2017 and stabilized within 0.6–0.7 after 2018, closely following the evolution of the annual mean NO2-to-SO2 concentration ratio. The minimum seasonal average γ occurred in winter (0.56), while the maximum was observed in autumn (0.64). These results provide a comprehensive characterization of the long-term and seasonal hygroscopicity of pollutants over central China, enhancing our understanding of the influence of hygroscopic growth on lidar-observed particle backscatter coefficients and offering valuable insights for urban air pollution control strategies."

Bucheli;Ralf Kaegi;Christoph Hueglin,Atmospheric deposition of microplastics: a sampling and analytical method including the associated measurement uncertainties,"Microplastics are environmental contaminants of global concern. In this study, we developed a method for measuring the amount of microplastics in atmospheric samples. In doing so, we introduced a new way to collect rain/snow samples and a custom software that helps with the analysis of microplastics. We then assessed the precision of our method and tested it on real samples. Our work may be useful for researchers seeking to measure microplastics in environmental samples. 
 Microplastics (MPs) are environmental contaminants of global concern, and the atmosphere may play an important role in their environmental distribution. In this study, we developed a tailored analytical chain – including sample collection, processing, and analysis based on optical microscopy and focal plane array μ-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FPA-μ-FTIR) – to quantify 20–215 µm MPs (excluding tire wear particles) in wet and dry atmospheric deposition samples. We present a novel sampling setup to collect particulate wet deposition, which consists of an on-site precipitation filtration device. Validation of the sampling setup via spike-recovery experiments using surrogate standards resulted in average recoveries of approximately 90 %, suggesting limited MP losses. Additionally, we developed a custom software platform that combines the results from optical microscopy and chemical imaging obtained through FPA-μ-FTIR. Furthermore, an assessment of the total measurement uncertainty was made by addressing each step of the analytical chain individually. The resulting total expanded uncertainty was approximately 90 % for determining MP numbers in a single wet or dry deposition sample. The conversion of MP numbers and associated size information into MP mass was estimated to generate an additional systematic error of 50 %. Based on analyses of blanks, the critical level and the limit of detection, number-based thresholds for minimizing false positives and false negatives, were 29 and 58 MPs per analyzed subsample, respectively. The analytical chain was applied to quantify the MP content in wet and dry atmospheric deposition samples collected at a suburban site in Switzerland. The principles and methodology used in this study to calculate the uncertainties, recoveries and limits of detection are transferrable to other analytical methods intended for MP analysis. Such an assessment of method-specific uncertainties is an important step towards enhancing the comparability of MP (monitoring) data."

It was developed using large-scale wheat sample generation combined with region-specific feature selection strategies. The dataset demonstrates high accuracy (overall accuracy > 0.91) and offers detailed spatial information to support agricultural monitoring and food security efforts in China. 
 Wheat, as one of the main food crops in the world, plays a vital role in shaping agricultural trade patterns. China is the largest producer and consumer of wheat globally, characterized by extensive cultivation areas and diverse planting systems. However, current remote sensing-based wheat mapping studies often rely on uniform phenological feature variables, without adequately accounting for the significant differences in wheat growth cycles across China's diverse agro-ecological zones. In addition, the lack of large-scale training samples severely limits both the accuracy and the spatial-temporal generalization capacity. Furthermore, existing research in China focuses mainly on winter wheat monitoring and mapping, while spring wheat research remains largely inadequate, especially in the major spring wheat-producing areas of northern China, resulting in limited availability of targeted remote sensing products. These limitations hinder the development of high-accuracy, spatially comprehensive wheat mapping datasets and reduce the completeness of agricultural monitoring and food security assessments. To address these issues, this study proposes a cross-regional training sample generation method that integrates time-series remote sensing data with crop distribution products. Furthermore, a province-level, differentiated feature selection strategy is introduced to enhance the regional adaptability and classification performance of the model. Based on these methods, we developed 10 m resolution wheat distribution dataset (CN_Wheat10) covering the years 2018–2024. The dataset includes spring and winter wheat harvested area maps for 15 provinces and detailed winter wheat planted area maps for 10 provinces across China. Validation using a large-scale reference dataset built from field surveys and high-resolution imagery visual interpretation indicates that CN_Wheat10 achieves mapping accuracies above 0.93 for winter wheat and above 0.91 for spring wheat. When compared with wheat area statistics from the China Statistical Yearbook, the coefficient of determination (R2) exceeds 0.94 at the provincial level and remains above 0.88 at the municipal level. Spatially, wheat cultivation in China is characterized by a pattern of concentration in the east, dispersion in the west, a dominance of winter wheat, and a supplementary role of spring wheat. CN_Wheat10 provides spatial distribution information on both spring and winter wheat harvested areas and winter wheat planted regions in key production areas. Compared with existing products that mainly focus on winter wheat, this dataset expands both the spatial coverage and the crop types, offering more comprehensive data support for agricultural monitoring and management in China.

We used relief-shaded bare-earth DTMs and web map tile services (WMTS), classifying features by size, form, slope, and environment into three main types. The open-access ReCHAR database supports research on forest history, early industries, and human–environment interactions. 
 This study presents the first national-scale spatial inventory of relict charcoal hearths (RCHs) in Poland, based on high-resolution LiDAR data and digital terrain analysis. Using a combination of manual interpretation, GIS-based feature extraction, and K-prototypes clustering, we identified and classified 634 815 RCHs across forested regions of the country. Each feature was georeferenced and categorized by size, morphological characteristics, slope position, and environmental context, including current and potential vegetation and soil types. Spatial analyses revealed significant regional differences in hearth density, with the highest concentrations found in western and south-central Poland, particularly in the Lower Silesian, Stobrawa, and Świętokrzyskie forests. Cluster analysis distinguished three major types of RCHs, differing in their environmental settings and spatial organization: (1) lowland pine-dominated clusters on gentle terrain, (2) isolated features on steep slopes in mixed forests, and (3) high-density hearth groups in elevated areas. Although large portions of the country appear devoid of RCHs, we argue that this reflects limitations in preservation and detection – due to long-term agricultural activity in lowlands and erosion in mountainous areas – rather than an actual absence of charcoal production. The resulting ReCHAR database offers a unique, open-access tool for interdisciplinary research on forest history, human–environment interactions, and early industrial landscapes. Its modular design supports further expansion, including links to historical settlements and industries reliant on charcoal, such as metallurgy, glassmaking, and tar or potash production.

The long-term daily lake ice coverage, annual ice phenology, and the probability of complete ice-cover occurrence were produced for 32800 global lakes using gap-filled MODIS data from 2002 to 2024. Patterns and trends of ice phenology and ice-cover status quantitatively revealed that how lakes respond to the climate change. The dataset provides a valuable resource for hydrology, ecology and climate research. 
 Lake ice is an essential component of the terrestrial cryosphere and plays an important role in the socioeconomic and ecological systems of cold regions. However, existing lake ice datasets generally suffer from poor temporal continuity, limited spatial coverage, and a lack of observations for small and medium-sized lakes. Consequently, the global spatial patterns and long-term trends of lake ice have remained insufficiently understood. In this study, using MODIS observations, we developed global datasets of daily lake ice coverage (LIC), annual lake ice-cover status, annual lake ice phenology (LIP), and the probability of complete ice-cover occurrence (PCIO), including 32,800 lakes across global cold climate regions from 2002 through 2024. Validation against multiple remote sensing datasets demonstrated high accuracy and confirmed that our Lake Ice – Cold Climate Regions dataset (LI-CCR) effectively captures the spatiotemporal evolution of the lake ice zone. Quality assessments were conducted for both LIC and LIP, and the information was included as an integral component of the LI-CCR. The results show that most cold regions lakes in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere freeze before November (May) and melt from May (November) onward, with an average ice cover duration of about 200 days. Presently 89 % of the lakes experience completely frozen annually, and the number of intermittent or even ice-free lakes is increasing under the warming climate. The LI-CCR dataset provides comprehensive records of lake ice evolution in cold climate regions and offers valuable information for studies on lake–climate interactions, cryosphere changes, and ecosystem responses.

Our results identify southwestern China as the country's primary storm hotspot and link year-to-year frequency changes to Pacific Ocean climate patterns. This new dataset is a vital resource for improving weather forecasts and climate research. 
 Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs) are major convective weather systems occurring in midlatitude regions, typically associated with significant weather phenomena such as heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail. Based on the cloud-top temperature (CTT) data of the FY-2G satellite, and through multi-threshold screening combined with morphological analysis, an automated algorithm for MCC identification and tracking was developed. The algorithm is then applied to generate an hourly dataset of MCC variables over mainland China from June 2015 to December 2024. The dataset encompasses variables describing the spatial extent of the cold-core region (CTT < -52 °C) of MCCs, the minimum cloud-top temperature within the cold cloud shields, and the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the centroids of the cold cloud shields. This work also conducts a preliminary analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of MCCs over mainland China based on the dataset. Results indicate that MCCs occur more frequently in Southwest China than in other regions of the country, and over 70 % of MCC events occur in summer both in Southwest China and mainland China. Moreover, MCC frequency in Southwest China exhibits significant interannual variability."

Using an inverse modelling approach, we recover 4160 parameter pairs that expand global coverage and support improved marine primary production modelling. The dataset is publicly available through Zenodo repository. 
 Photosynthesis-irradiance and photosynthesis-depth experiments are two standard ways of experimentally quantifying primary production. These measurements have historically formed the backbone for the formulation of mathematical models of primary production and to this day remain an invaluable resource for model development and refinement. From such experiments information on photosynthesis parameters can be extracted, which allows for the quantification of the photosynthesis light dependence, essential in the calculation of primary production. To this day, this is the only avenue for photosynthesis parameters estimation, making such data invaluable for primary production modelling. In the literature, there have been several efforts to form global datasets of photosynthesis parameters, collected at various sites across the world oceans and seas. Here, we use a publicly available global dataset of in situ primary production profiles and construct a new database of photosynthesis parameters. We use an inverse modelling approach that is described in great details, along with the data requirements. For a forward model, we employ a fully solvable analytical model of the production profile, and we use the inverse model to compare it with the measured production profile, while constraining it with measured daily watercolumn production. Using this approach, we successfully recovered 4160 photosynthesis-irradiance parameters from the global oceans, which enabled a model versus data comparison for watercolumn production. The spatio-temporal distribution of the new dataset is presented and compared to existing datasets. Finally, the new photosynthesis parameters dataset is provided publicly, along with metadata needed for the implementation in primary production models."

Mallard;Tanya L. Spero;Jared H. Bowden;Jeff Willison;Christopher G. Nolte;Anna M. Jalowska,Examining spin-up behaviour within WRF dynamical downscaling applications,"“Spin-up” is time needed for a model’s result to become effectively free of influence from initial conditions, and it is usually excluded from analysis. Here, spin-up is examined by comparing one decadal simulation to another initialized 20 years prior, in order to determine when their solutions converge. Differences lessen over the first fall and winter, but re-emerge over the following spring and summer, suggesting that at least 1 annual cycle is needed to spin up regional climate simulations. 
 Spin-up is the period after initialization when a model transitions away from its dependence on initial conditions toward a dynamic equilibrium between driving boundary conditions and its own internal dynamics. Regional climate models (RCMs) are often used to simulate conditions over several decades to inform local adaptation and resilience activities. The spin-up period represents added cost to already resource-intensive simulations, and it is often infeasible to use a spin-up period that produces complete model equilibrium. Therefore, a pragmatic compromise is desired to minimize the effects of spin-up. Here, two overlapping dynamically downscaled simulations (31 year and 11 year integrations) using the Weather Research and Forecasting model over the contiguous US (CONUS) are used to explore convergence associated with model spin-up. The shorter simulation is initialized 20 years after initialization of the longer (reference) run, and the runs are analysed over the period covered by both simulations, giving the reference simulation a 20 year period to attain spin-up prior to comparison. After initialization, the shorter run features cooler surface and near-surface temperatures and greater soil moisture compared to the reference simulation. Differences between the runs decrease in magnitude over the first 3 months as autumn transitions to winter; however, these differences re-emerge and reach a secondary peak during the proceeding spring and summer. During this warm season, evaporation and accompanying evaporative cooling increase and temperature differences between the simulations re-emerge. These results support using at least one year of spin-up time in RCM applications to account for the seasonality of spin-up behaviour. Results from some regions of the CONUS indicate that spin-up durations of 1–4 years are needed to exclude spurious behavior in top-layer soil moisture, which exhibits prolonged spin-up compared with other near-surface variables examined here."

Using idealized setups and thunderstorm case studies, we find differences in numerical diffusion and extreme precipitation rates due to changed coupling with the remaining microphysics. Neither method develops alarming instabilities in full model setups; both can be safely used. 
 In the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model, the Seifert-Beheng two-moment microphysics scheme is one approach to simulate clouds with different hydrometeor classes. In this bulk description, sedimentation is modeled by advecting the first two moments (number and mass densities) of the hydrometeor size distributions with velocities derived from fitting a generalized gamma distribution to the moments. This method implicitly relies on the diffusive properties of the numerical advection schemes to obtain results in closer agreement with the exact spectral solution. The implementation in ICON offers both a semi-implicit and largely untested explicit method for sedimentation. Currently, the semi-implicit scheme is substantially slower on graphics processing units (GPUs), which is particularly relevant considering the recent rise of GPUs in supercomputing; this raises the question of whether the explicit scheme is a viable alternative.We provide a detailed examination of both sedimentation schemes, their differences, and underlying assumptions. Using idealized one-dimensional experiments, we identify a minor issue in the default semi-implicit scheme (flux limiter artifacts) and propose a solution. Additionally, we show that the explicit scheme exhibits less numerical diffusion, though some diffusion is crucial for accurate bulk sedimentation. Purely horizontal grid refinement leads to increased diffusion in the explicit scheme, whereas finer vertical resolutions may result in insufficient diffusion, especially for the explicit scheme. An analysis of six case studies with thunderstorms reveals that the explicit scheme gives rise to more jagged patterns in the hydrometeor profiles, although without concerning instabilities. Furthermore, some differences in hail and graupel precipitation rates can be attributed to different ways of considering the microphysical source terms (e.g., hydrometeor interactions) during the sedimentation step."

However, the compositional complexity of organic waste introduces poorly understood inhibitory effects on the AD process, leading to reduced methane yields and process instability. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), potent oxidants produced under microbial stress, can damage cellular components and disrupt methanogenesis; yet, their roles in AD remain largely unexplored. This review highlights, for the first time, a comprehensive perspective on the formation pathways and fate of key ROS oxidants within anaerobic systems and the need for accurate ROS detection methods. Importantly, we propose a novel insight that ROS may facilitate the degradation of emerging organic pollutants in digestate, offering increased safety before land application for soil remediation. Furthermore, the review provides a pioneering discussion on the link between ROS and CH4/CO2 emissions, including mechanistic insights and long-term environmental implications. Our findings suggest that the potential greenhouse gas flux from digestate due to ROS-related processes warrants serious attention. Overall, this review aims to advance the understanding of ROS in anaerobic digestion and support the optimization of both AD performance and its downstream ecological impacts."

Mason,Sea-Ice-Driven Mercury Depletion over the Arctic Marginal Ice Zone Revealed by Direct Shipborne Observations,"The Arctic is undergoing rapid environmental change, with sea-ice loss altering key exchanges among the cryosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. During spring, atmospheric mercury and ozone depletion events (AMDEs and ODEs) drive rapid declines in gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) and ozone (O3), promoting mercury deposition to snow, ice, and marine ecosystems. Despite three decades of research, AMDEs have been documented almost exclusively at coastal land-based stations, leaving their occurrence and mechanisms over oceanic sea-ice poorly constrained. To address this gap, we conducted a research cruise in the Arctic marginal ice zone to study the connections between sea-ice and atmospheric Hg chemistry. We measured atmospheric Hg0, reactive gaseous Hg (RGM), and O3 along the cruise track, identifying the simultaneous occurrences of AMDEs and ODEs. Air mass back-trajectory analysis combined with sea-ice images from satellite remote sensing revealed that these depletion events occurred exclusively when air masses originated from over sea-ice and were near its surface.

However, their assembly mechanisms and ecological implications remain poorly understood. Here, we sampled microplastics and adjacent soils at 27 urban wetland sites in Changsha, China, to sequence bacterial communities and assess their assembly processes and environmental drivers. Plastispheres selectively recruit soil bacteria, with bacterial richness representing only 51.6–69.3% of that in adjacent soils despite positive correlations with source communities. Improved nutrient availability and favorable hydrothermal conditions within plastispheres reduce dispersal limitation while enhancing homogenizing selection. Network analysis indicates stronger positive correlations and greater structural robustness, reflecting niche consolidation in these confined microhabitats. Moreover, KEGG-based functional predictions reveal intensified redox-driven metabolism, where degradation of recalcitrant organics (e.g., xenobiotics, lipids and phosphonates) is inferred to supply electrons for nitrate/nitrite reduction─a coupling amplified under nitrate-enriched, well-aerated conditions. These findings collectively establish plastispheres as self-contained “micro-enclaves”, where local environmental and edaphic factors reshape microbial community and functions. They deepen our understanding of plastisphere-mediated biogeochemical processes and pollution mechanisms, thereby providing a scientific basis for conserving and managing wetland ecosystem health."

 The exponential growth of scientific literature presents an increasingly acute challenge across disciplines. Hundreds of thousands of new chemical reactions are reported annually, yet translating them into actionable experiments becomes an obstacle1,2. Recent applications of large language models (LLMs) have shown promise3,4,5,6, but systems that reliably work for diverse transformations across de novo compounds have remained elusive. Here we introduce MOSAIC (Multiple Optimized Specialists for AI-assisted Chemical Prediction), a computational framework that enables chemists to harness the collective knowledge of millions of reaction protocols. MOSAIC is built upon the Llama-3.1-8B-instruct architecture7, training 2,498 specialized chemical experts within Voronoi-clustered spaces. This approach delivers reproducible and executable experimental protocols with confidence metrics for complex syntheses. With an overall 71% success rate, experimental validation demonstrates the realizations of over 35 novel compounds, spanning pharmaceuticals, materials, agrochemicals, and cosmetics. Notably, MOSAIC also enables the discovery of new reaction methodologies that are absent from the expert’s training, a cornerstone for advancing chemical synthesis. This scalable paradigm of partitioning vast domains into searchable expert regions enables a generalizable strategy for AI-assisted discovery wherever accelerating information growth outpaces efficient knowledge access and application."

Gut macrophages clear α-synuclein via C1q–complement pathways; loss of this response worsens neuropathology and improves gut function, implicating neuroimmune crosstalk. 
 Deposition of misfolded α-synuclein (αsyn) in the enteric nervous system (ENS) is found in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. It is hypothesized that ENS synucleinopathy contributes to both the pathogenesis and non-motor morbidity in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), but the cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape enteric histopathology and dysfunction are poorly understood. Here, we employ a fibrillar injection model of enteric synucleinopathy in male mice and demonstrate that ENS-resident macrophages, which play a critical role in maintaining ENS homeostasis, initially respond to enteric neuronal αsyn pathology by upregulating machinery for complement-mediated engulfment. Pharmacologic depletion of ENS-macrophages or genetic deletion of C1q enhanced enteric neuropathology. Conversely, C1q deletion ameliorated gut dysfunction, indicating that complement partially mediates αsyn-induced gut dysfunction. However, this C1q-dependent clearance mechanism diminished over time and its failure temporally correlated with the further increase in ENS pathology. These findings highlight the importance of enteric neuron-macrophage interactions in removing toxic protein aggregates that putatively shape the gastrointestinal manifestations of PD.

 Remembering everyday events involves noticing what different experiences share and preserving the details that set them apart, yet the neural processes supporting this balance remain unclear. Here, we record EEG while participants view naturalistic movie scenes that introduce episodic events with overlapping elements. Using time-resolved representational similarity analysis, we find that these events evoke both similarities and dissimilarities in neural patterns as new information unfolds. Similarities predict successful inference of information across separate episodes, consistent with integrative encoding. Dissimilarities, by contrast, predict accurate memory for individual events, indicating the formation of distinct event-specific traces. Together, these findings indicate that the brain encodes both integrated and separated neural representations to flexibly support different mnemonic goals and to balance relational inference with detailed recollection. People often need to remember unique details while also finding connections across experiences.

 Colorectal cancer responds poorly to immune checkpoint blockade in most patients with microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors, highlighting the need for alternative targets. B7H3 (CD276) is an immune checkpoint protein that is frequently overexpressed in tumors, but how it is maintained at high protein levels is unclear. Here we show that palmitic acid (PA) promotes B7H3 palmitoylation by the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC24 at cysteine 496. This modification prevents B7H3 from binding to sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, also called p62), limiting autophagic degradation and stabilizing B7H3, which suppresses CD8+ T cell antitumor activity. Disrupting this pathway by mutating cysteine 496, or by deleting Zdhhc24 in a colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) mouse model, enhances CD8+ T cell responses. We also develop a cell-penetrant peptide that blocks the ZDHHC24–B7H3 interaction, boosts antitumor immunity, and synergizes with blockade of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings identify B7H3 palmitoylation as a targetable metabolic–immune node for colorectal cancer immunotherapy.

Stephenson,Breaking the link: warming disrupts early-season rainfall predictability in the Caribbean,"Breaking the link: warming disrupts early-season rainfall predictability in the Caribbean 
 Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical North Atlantic have historically served as reliable predictors of early-season rainfall across the Caribbean. In particular, rainfall onset has been linked to SSTs exceeding the convective threshold necessary to support deep convection. However, recent warming trends appear to have altered this relationship. Here, we show that although SSTs routinely exceed the convective threshold earlier in the season, early rainfall has not increased. This decoupling reflects a shift in the atmospheric state, with enhanced stability, evidenced by reduced convective available potential energy and increased convective inhibition, increasingly suppressing convection. Reduced rainfall results in a more persistent Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ), further inhibiting rainfall by promoting subsidence and dry air advection. Correlations indicate that dynamic atmospheric variables now explain a larger share of rainfall variability than absolute SSTs. These findings signal a regime shift in Caribbean rainfall dynamics and raise concerns about the declining utility of SST-based predictors under continued climate warming. These results have significant implications for seasonal forecasting and adaptation planning across Caribbean Small Island Developing States."

 Product reuse advances circular economy by reducing material demand. However, environmental assessments often assume reused products fully replace new ones, or they overlook market changes and shortened lifespans driven by resale and repurchase opportunities. This study presents an empirically based analysis of the second-hand smartphone market and its cumulative effects on manufacturing demand and carbon emissions. Integrating consumer survey data and product lifetime estimates in a stock-and-flow model, we find that in the United States, each second-hand transaction currently extends smartphone use time by 40%, displaces 0.40 new devices, and that circular consumption results in a 34% lower annual carbon footprint. With 25% of consumers purchasing used phones, production demand and carbon emissions are lowered by 15% and 14%, respectively. Yet, shortened use times offset nearly half the potential gains. If reuse became the norm, manufacturing demand could decline by one-third, revealing both the promise and the limits of reuse.

 Coral tissue depth reflects organismal health and is influenced by environmental stressors. Reconstructing its past variability on inter- and intra-annual timescales, however, is not yet possible. Here we reconstructed seasonal tissue depth by measuring spatial offsets between growth cycles in corallite porosity and theca geochemistry (Lithium/Magnesium and Barium/Calcium ratios) of a single Siderastrea siderea core collected in Barbados. We show spatial offsets and thus tissue depth vary systematically over multiyear timescales, with decreasing values associated with thermal stress that impact extension rate and calcification in subsequent growth cycles. Large environmental disturbances such as the 2021 volcanic eruption of La Soufrière (St. Vincent) also impact tissue depth, in this case likely due to the release of bioactive metals upon ash deposition. This study investigates the robustness of the offset signal within a single colony and with further validation across multiple colonies could help reconstruct regional to global environmental and ecological stressors.

 Africa’s coastal regions face accelerating sea level rise compounded by climate variability. Here we analyze satellite altimetry data from 1993 to 2024 across African marine domains. The 2023–2024 El Niño produced the largest detrended sea level anomaly on record (27 mm), exceeding even the stronger 1997–1998 event. This exceptional response arose from ocean preconditioning: record-positive Indian Ocean Dipole, Atlantic Niño, and Tropical North Atlantic indices preceded and amplified El Niño forcing, while anomalous winds suppressed upwelling and record stratification trapped surface heat, quadrupling ocean heat content. Thermal expansion accounted for over 70% of this event’s total anomaly, reaching nearly 30 mm across the African marine domain. Sea levels rose 11.26 cm since 1993, accelerating at 0.14 mm.yr-2, exceeding the global average. These findings reveal compound threats to low-lying deltas and Small Island Developing States from flooding, ongoing land subsidence, and declining marine productivity.

 The exchange of carbon between oceanic plates, the deep Earth, and the atmosphere plays a significant role in modulating global climate. Icehouse-greenhouse climate fluctuations have been attributed to changes in palaeogeography and solid Earth degassing, particularly along continental arcs, to arc weathering and to the sequestration of carbon into oceanic carbonate-rich sediments. However, the proportions of these contributions and their effect on modulating global climate are poorly constrained. Here we show that the changing balance between volcanic outgassing and carbon sequestration into oceanic lithosphere is the key driver for major climate shifts. Combined volcanic arc, mid-ocean ridge and continental rift emissions exceed carbon sequestration during greenhouse climates. In contrast, oceanic plate sequestration exceeds emissions during icehouse climates. Our results challenge the long-held view that carbon degassing along volcanic arcs is the main contributor to atmospheric carbon, suggesting instead that mid-ocean ridge and rift degassing surpass arc emissions before 100 Ma. Combined degassing from mid-ocean ridges and continental rifts outweigh volcanic arc emissions before 50 Ma, according to thermodynamic modelling coupled to tectonic reconstructions of carbon reservoir fluxes analysis."

 Aerosols significantly impact solar radiation forecasts, but substantial uncertainties persist in numerical models due to inadequate aerosol representation. This study develops a data assimilation framework integrating hourly surface-level particulate matter (PM₂.₅) retrievals from the FY-4B geostationary satellite into the WRF-Chem model with solar radiation diagnostics via the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) system. Assimilation experiments conducted over central and eastern China in November 2022 demonstrate marked improvements in PM₂.₅ forecasts, with correlation coefficients increasing from 0.39 to 0.82, and root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by approximately 45%. Improved aerosol initial conditions significantly reduce uncertainties in surface downward shortwave radiation (SWDOWN) predictions, lowering midday bias by over 50% and RMSE by roughly 40% across the domain. Consistent forecast enhancements were verified through spatiotemporal analyses across various pollution levels. These results highlight the practical value of assimilating hourly FY-4B PM₂.₅ retrievals for simultaneously improving air quality and solar radiation forecasts. The proposed assimilation approach offers a robust, replicable solution for near-real-time operational forecasting, thereby supporting photovoltaic energy planning and effective air quality management."

 Rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most dangerous and least predictable weather systems. In this work, we focus on two intense Atlantic TCs that showed rapid intensification (RI, defined as at least 36 hPa deepening in 24 h) and which impacted the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. This study focused on how sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean mixed-layer depth (OMLD) modulate the rapid intensification (RI) and maximum intensity (MI) of two hurricanes, Wilma and Rita (2005). Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a simplified 1D ocean model, 20 simulations were performed to systematically vary SST (±1–3 °C) and OMLD (doubled or halved), as well as remove observed SST anomalies (SSTA). Results show that SST dominates TC intensity changes from around 15–20 hPa °C−1, and correspondingly higher deepening rates. Warmer simulations also exhibit an increased energy transfer from the ocean, supporting increased near-surface equivalent potential temperature, a more symmetrical wind field and elevated accumulated cyclone energy (ACE). By contrast, deeper OMLD enhances thermodynamic support but is constrained by SST conditions, limiting the total surface heat flux in the storm's vicinity. Results also stress that remote heat fluxes across a broader region, not just beneath the storm core, play a crucial role in determining maximum intensity and deepening. Westward landfall shifts up to 300 km are observed in +3 °C scenarios, emphasizing the potential of ocean heat in altering trajectories. These findings highlight the critical importance of accurately representing upper-ocean thermal structures to improve predictions of TC intensity and trajectories, particularly as warmer future SSTs may lead to more frequent and dynamically evolving hurricanes."
