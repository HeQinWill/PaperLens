10.1088/1748-9326/ade72c,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注气象干旱到湿润的转变如何影响水文干旱到洪涝的转变，重点在于欧洲流域。论文分析了气象转变与水文转变之间的关系，发现两者关联性较弱。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联，主要侧重于水文气象领域。,[],Manuela I Brunner;Bailey Anderson;Eduardo Muñoz-Castro,Meteorological and hydrological dry-to-wet transition events are only weakly related over European catchments,"Transitions from dry to wet states challenge water management and can lead to severe impacts. While meteorological transitions from dry-to-wet spells are well studied, it is yet unclear how, and if, they propagate to hydrological transitions. Here, we study where and why seasonal meteorological transitions propagate to drought-to-flood transitions in Europe using a large-sample dataset of hydro-meteorological observations. Our analysis shows that the relationship between meteorological and hydrological transitions is weak, with only 10% and 25% of the meteorological transitions propagating to the hydrosphere at monthly and annual time scales, respectively. Transition propagation is limited by the propagation of wet spells, in particular those with small precipitation intensities and volumes but favored in catchments with a direct link between precipitation and streamflow and limited storage influences. As hydrological and meteorological transitions are only weakly related, changes in meteorological transitions are a relatively poor proxy for future changes in drought-to-flood transitions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade72e,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是公用事业规模的可再生能源项目（如风能和太阳能）对公众气候政策态度的影响，特别是考察项目邻近性是否会影响人们对气候政策的支持。研究发现，对于民主党和共和党人，项目邻近性对气候政策偏好没有显著影响；但对于独立人士，居住在风力涡轮机附近与减少对气候政策的反对有关，尤其是在清洁能源技术的大规模投资方面。因此，该研究的核心在于政治态度、可再生能源项目和气候政策之间的关系，而非大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Shan Zhou;Zhengyan Li;Aseem Prakash,Nonpartisans hold the key: how proximity to utility scale renewable energy projects influences attitudes towards climate mitigation policy,"Not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) literature notes public opposition to projects that impose local costs but generate public goods. However, whether NIMBY experience has spillover effects on support for related policy goals remains underexplored. As a typical case of NIMBYism, utility-scale renewable energy projects have faced significant local opposition across the U.S. In this paper, we investigate if an individual’s proximity to such projects correlates with their support for broader climate goals. Drawing on individual responses from three waves of cross-sectional U.S. Nationscape survey data (2019–2021), we constructed a comprehensive dataset by combining them with geocoded information on all utility-scale renewable energy projects for this period, as well as with county-level socioeconomic, political, and policy information. Our regression results show that proximity to wind or solar projects does not significantly influence climate policy preferences among Democrats or Republicans. However, for political Independents, living near wind turbines correlates with reduced opposition to climate policies, specifically large-scale investments for clean energy technology. These findings suggest that climate attitudes linked to renewable energy exposure are contingent on political affiliation. While strong partisans (Democrats and Republicans) remain unaffected by direct exposure to renewable energy projects, Independents—who are less anchored by partisan narratives—are more responsive to personal experience. Exposure to wind power does not necessarily create strong supporters for climate policy, but it shifts Independents away from outright opposition. The results highlight the necessity of more targeted approaches to expand public support for climate policies."

However, we have limited knowledge about the carbon sink capacity of coastal wetlands, whereby developing advanced skills for predicting CO2 fluxes of coastal wetlands is critical. Here, by employing recent cutting-edge achievements in artificial intelligence, we evaluated three automated machine learning (AutoML) platforms, including Lazy Predict, H2O AutoML and fast and lightweight automated machine learning, for predicting monthly gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in China’s of mangrove and saltmarsh coastal wetlands with multi-source satellite observations. Our results indicate that these AutoML platforms effectively predicted GPP, RE, and NEE, with superior performance for GPP and RE compared to NEE. For individual predictions across 14 sites, the testing set yielded average determination coefficient (R2) values of 0.74, 0.79, and 0.63, and root mean square error values of 0.83, 0.45, and 0.76 gC m−2s−1 for GPP, RE, and NEE, respectively. Cross-site predictions performed better for saltmarsh (average R2: 0.86, 0.84, and 0.76 for GPP, RE, and NEE) than mangrove ecosystems (average R2: 0.72, 0.76, and 0.59). In addition, ensemble ML models, particularly on the Lazy Predict platform, significantly outperformed individual models. Feature important analyses revealed that vegetation variables (leaf area index and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) play pronouncedly important roles in mangrove ecosystems, followed by climate variables (air temperature (Ta) and precipitation) with considerably important roles, while Ta dominated in saltmarsh ecosystems, with vegetation variables but playing a lesser role. Our study offers valuable insights for utilizing AutoML techniques to enhance CO2 flux predictions and regional budget estimations for coastal wetlands, potentially advancing strategies for monitoring large-scale coastal ‘blue carbon’ dynamics."

Here, we address this important knowledge gap through a study of 37 soil metrics for 11 restored floodplains and two reference sites across a chronosequence of 0–22 years. Soil metrics differed in their sensitivity and response to restoration and followed different rates of change including fast (0–2 years), moderate (2–10 years), and slow (>10 years). Physicochemical metrics dominated the first two trajectories, whereas biological metrics, while sensitive, fell into the last trajectory. Soil recovery rates for restored sites differed considerably for reference sites highlighting the need to better define reference conditions. Availability of consistent and sensitive soil health metrics will allow restoration practitioners to better assess restoration recovery and receive regulatory credits for meeting restoration targets."

This time-series ecological study evaluated the association between annual ambient PM2.5 and NO2 exposure and school-level National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) scores between 2008 and 2018 in Australia. Annual concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 were estimated with satellite-based land use regression models. Weighted multipollutant mixed effects models, adjusted for available confounders, were used to evaluate the association between air pollutants and school-level NAPLAN scores. A total of 9268 schools were included in the study. We found that increasing exposure to PM2.5 within a 10 km radius around the school was associated with poorer school-level scores in Reading, Numeracy, Spelling, and Grammar and Punctuation NAPLAN domains for certain grades. Unexpectedly, we found that increasing exposure to NO2 was associated with higher school-level scores in all domains. Our findings for PM2.5 are consistent with previous literature and suggest that associations between PM2.5 and adverse educational outcomes could occur in lower pollution settings. Our findings for NO2 were in the opposite direction to what was expected from prior studies. We posit that these findings may be driven by uncontrolled confounders, such as individual socio-economic factors or exposure misclassification for NO2 which has high spatial variability not captured by our models given NO2 concentrations rapidly decrease away from major high traffic roads. Further exploration of these results is required to understand the association between air pollution and academic performance in this context."
10.5194/acp-25-6633-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了污染对东地中海地区阿拉伯和撒哈拉沙尘光学性质的影响。通过A-LIFE飞机实验的数据，研究发现污染的增加会显著改变沙尘的光学性质，这对于识别沙尘事件和理解其气候效应具有重要意义。研究还表明，在污染程度相同的情况下，撒哈拉和阿拉伯沙尘的光学性质相似。论文强调了量化沙尘层中污染含量的必要性，以便准确评估其局部直接辐射效应。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及大气成分分析（沙尘、人为气溶胶）、空气质量（污染对沙尘的影响）以及辐射效应，这些都可能通过卫星观测等遥感手段进行监测和研究。,"['mineral dust', 'anthropogenic aerosols', 'optical properties', 'radiative effect', 'A-LIFE experiment', 'Ångström exponent', 'single-scattering albedo', 'asymmetry parameter', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition']",Marilena Teri;Josef Gasteiger;Katharina Heimerl;Maximilian Dollner;Manuel Schöberl;Petra Seibert;Anne Tipka;Thomas Müller;Sudharaj Aryasree;Konrad Kandler;Bernadett Weinzierl,Pollution affects Arabian and Saharan dust optical properties in the eastern Mediterranean,"The A-LIFE aircraft field experiment was carried out in the eastern Mediterranean in 2017. Using A-LIFE data, we studied the change in mineral dust optical properties due to mixing with anthropogenic aerosols. We found that increasing pollution affects dust optical properties, which has implications for identifying dust events and understanding their climate effects. We also show that optical properties of Saharan and Arabian dust are similar when comparing cases with equal pollution content. 
 Uncertainties in the direct radiative effect of mineral dust result from the variability in its optical properties but are also influenced by mixing with anthropogenic aerosols (“pollution”), e.g., black carbon or sulfates. This study investigates the effect of mixing pollution with mineral dust from different source regions on the intensive optical properties. The Ångström exponents of scattering and absorption, the single-scattering albedo, and the asymmetry parameter are determined from in situ measurements during the A-LIFE aircraft field experiment over the eastern Mediterranean, where Arabian and Saharan dust mixed with pollution. Our results show that all intensive dust optical properties change significantly with increasing pollution content, while differences between Arabian and Saharan dust are not statistically significant. We discuss the implications of these results for the identification of mineral dust events and for their direct radiative effects. The pollution masks the mineral dust signal, which calls for caution when using Ångström exponents to identify mineral dust events. Furthermore, the asymmetry parameter and single-scattering albedo change from pure to polluted mineral dust layers (e.g., at 525 nm, median values decrease from 0.67 to 0.56 and from 0.96 to 0.89, respectively). These changes have opposing effects on the shortwave direct radiative effect efficiency (i.e., the direct radiative effect per unit of aerosol optical depth), potentially canceling each other out. Still, the effect can be significant depending on surface albedo. In conclusion, quantifying pollution content in mineral dust layers is essential for accurately assessing their local direct radiative effect."

We use an atmospheric model to simulate multilayer cloud cases from the Arctic expedition MOSAiC 2019/2020. We find that it is complex to accurately model these cloud layers due to the lack of correct temperature profiles. The model also struggles to capture the observed cloud phase and the relative concentration of cloud droplets and cloud ice. We constrain our model to measured aerosols to mitigate this issue. 
 Multilayered clouds are frequent in the Arctic, but their detailed analysis is underrepresented. Here, we simulate two cases observed during the 2019/2020 MOSAiC expedition using the ICosahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) model to explore the most accurate representation of these multilayer clouds. With a limited-area setup, we investigate how cloud layers respond to perturbations in cloud droplet activation, primary ice, and secondary ice production (SIP). Using the measured aerosol concentration, we constrain our model through a new immersion freezing parameterisation. We find that multilayered clouds are challenging to simulate in remote areas with sparsely assimilated thermodynamics and that large-scale biases in the global forcing carry over to high-resolution simulations. In terms of cloud microphysics, high-temperature ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are necessary to capture the cloud phase of warm mixed-phase clouds. However, constraining the model to the observed INPs is insufficient; a factor of 106 is required to reach observed ice mass concentrations, which is also achieved by including SIP. Breakup upon ice–ice collisions is explosive and can increase the cloud ice number concentration by a factor of 106. Furthermore, the seeder–feeder mechanism significantly boosts snowfall by a factor of 103. An accurate representation of these microphysical processes is crucial to simulate multilayer clouds."

Saide;Tong Ye;Weihang Wang;Ming Zhang;Jiejun Huang,Evaluating spatiotemporal variations and exposure risk of ground-level ozone concentrations across China from 2000 to 2020 using high-resolution satellite-derived data,"We analyzed ground-level ozone variations and exposure hotspots across China (2000–2020) at multiple scales using daily 1 km ozone data derived from satellite-sourced land-surface temperature data via a machine-learning hindcasting model. The dataset was validated using cross-validation and external measurements. A non-monotonic trend with regional and seasonal variations emerged, with turning points around 2008 and 2015. Ozone levels >100 μg m‾³ shifted from June to May, while levels >160 μg m‾³ expanded in the North China Plain. 
 Understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics of both long- and short-term exposure to ground-level ozone is crucial for refining environmental management and improving health studies. However, such studies have been constrained by the availability of high-resolution spatiotemporal data. To address this gap, we characterized ground-level ozone variations and exposure risks across multiple spatial (pixel, county, region, and national) and temporal (daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual) scales using daily 1 km ozone data from 2000 to 2020, derived from satellite-sourced land surface temperature data via a machine-learning hindcast method. The model provided reliable estimates, validated through rigorous cross-validation and direct comparison with external ground-level ozone measurements. Our long-term estimates revealed seasonal shifts in high-exposure ozone centers: spring in eastern China, summer in the North China Plain (NCP), and autumn in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). A non-monotonic trend was observed, with ozone levels rising from 2001–2007 at a rate of 0.47 µgm-3yr-1, declining after 2008 (−0.58 µgm-3yr-1), and increasing significantly from 2016–2020 (1.16 µgm-3yr-1), accompanied by regional and seasonal fluctuations. Notably, ozone levels increased by 0.63 µgm-3yr-1 in summer in the NCP during the second phase and by 6.38 µgm-3yr-1 in autumn in the PRD during the third phase. Exposure levels over 100 µg m−3 have shifted from June to May, and levels exceeding 160 µg m−3 were primarily seen in the NCP, showing an expanding trend. Our day-to-day analysis highlights the influence of meteorological factors on extreme events. These findings emphasize the need for increased public health awareness and stronger mitigation efforts."

Lee Thornhill,In-cloud characteristics observed in northeastern and midwestern US non-orographic winter storms with implications for ice particle mass growth and residence time,"We analyzed in-cloud characteristics using in situ measurements from 42 research flights across two field campaigns into non-orographic, non-lake-effect winter storms. Much of the storm volume contains weak vertical motions (a few centimeters per second), and most updrafts ≥ 0.5 m s-1 are small (< 1 km). Within 2 km of cloud radar echo top, stronger vertical motions and conditions for ice particle growth are more common. Overturning air motions near cloud top appear important for the production of snow particles. 
 The spatial distribution of surface snowfall accumulation is dependent on the 3D trajectories of ice particles and their residence times through regions of ice mass increases and decreases. We analyze 42 non-orographic, non-lake-effect winter storms in the northeastern and midwestern United States from the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) and Profiling of Winter Storms (PLOWS) field campaigns. In situ aircraft measurements (1 Hz, ∼ 100 m horizontal distance) yield key data on vertical air motions, relative humidity with respect to ice (RHice), and number concentration. When suitable airborne radar data are available, we sort the in situ measurements by distance from cloud radar echo top.In total, 90 % of updrafts (vertical air motion ≥0.5 m s−1) were ≤1.3 km across. Measurements obtained within 3 km of cloud echo top were nearly twice as likely (13 % versus 7 %) to have vertical velocities capable of lofting precipitation-sized ice compared to points sampled at lower levels. Below the near-cloud-top generating cell layer, most of the storm volume has RHice≤95 % consistent with sublimation.Rather than ice precipitation growth within broad areas of vertical air motions, observations indicate that ice growth in these storms primarily occurs episodically within layers of overturning cloud-top generating cells with scales ≤ a few kilometers. Below the generating cell layer, conditions for ice growth are rarer, and the ice particles usually either persist or shrink during most of their descent. The observed distributions of ambient in-cloud conditions provide benchmarks for evaluations of winter storm model output."

By running simulations with different setups, we found that seeding impact varies greatly with weather conditions. Seeding increased snow in stable weather but sometimes reduced it in stormy weather. This helps us to better understand when seeding works best to boost water supplies. 
 Winter precipitation over Australia's Snowy Mountains provides a  crucial water resource in the region. Cloud seeding has been operational to enhance snowfall and water storage. This study presents ensemble simulations to assess cloud seeding impacts across diverse meteorological conditions and evaluate associated model uncertainties. Nine seeding cases from 2016 to 2019 were simulated, with 18 ensemble members varying initialization datasets and model configurations. Two main storm categories were studied (convective vs. stratiform). Results demonstrate that simulated seeding efficacy highly depends on meteorological conditions. Stratiform cases exhibited consistent precipitation enhancement, while convective cases showed reductions and downwind shifts in precipitation. Significantly inter-member variability was also observed. Notably, simulations driven by the Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) reanalysis dataset show better representation in supercooled liquid water. Aerosol and planetary boundary layer scheme variations also contributed to ensemble spread. The findings demonstrate the value of ensemble modeling for reliable cloud seeding assessment. Key areas are also identified for future investigations in winter cloud seeding."

The analysis examines various aspects of both the RO instrument and the bending angle processing chain. The resulting bending angle profiles were compared against forward-modeled profiles from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), confirming the processor's ability to consistently produce accurate and reliable data. 
 This study presents an exhaustive assessment of the Sentinel-6A Michael Freilich radio occultation (RO) data, focusing on the evaluation of bending angle products derived from the EUMETSAT-provided RO non-time-critical (RO-NTC) data collected between September and December 2021. The RO instrument has been performing very well since its launch in 2020, consistently surpassing its mission target of providing 770 quality-checked bending angle profiles per day. With a remarkable availability rate of 99.9 % during full operational periods, the mission demonstrates robust performance and reliability. A detailed examination of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and phase noise indicates the high-quality nature of the data. The study also analyses the benefits of employing SNR-based signal cut-off strategies and L2 signal extrapolation in the troposphere, where it is more susceptible to SNR reductions. Furthermore, the paper details some processor enhancements, which led to improved bending angle statistics, particularly below 22 km altitude. Additionally, the analysis revealed terrestrial interference signals on the L2 frequency, confirming that they do not significantly compromise the Sentinel-6A RO data quality.The validation of the EUMETSAT processed Sentinel-6A RO-NTC data against the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) short-range forecasts and comparisons with Metop-B/C and EUMETSAT-processed SPIRE occultations, highlights the reduction in random error and modifications in the tropospheric bias structure, a result of the enhancements in data processing techniques. This comprehensive analysis confirms the high quality of the EUMETSAT Sentinel-6A bending angle products and underlines the satellite's contribution to the EUMETSAT legacy of precise and reliable RO data for weather forecasting and climate research."

By combining four data sources, we obtained a detailed representation of the riverbed, with resolutions ranging from 2 to 100 m. This dataset will support future studies on water and nutrient exchanges between the Danube and the Black Sea and provide insights into the delta's buffer role within the understudied Danube–Black Sea continuum. 
 Acting as a buffer between the Danube and the Black Sea, the Danube Delta plays an important role in regulating the hydro-biochemical flows of this land–sea continuum. Despite its importance, very few studies have focused on the impact of the Danube Delta on the different fluxes between the Danube and the Black Sea. One of the first steps in characterizing this land–sea continuum is to describe the bathymetry of the delta. However, there are no complete, easily accessible bathymetric data on all three branches of the delta to support hydrodynamic, biogeochemical, or ecological studies. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by combining four different datasets, three in the river and one for the riverbanks, each varying in density and spatial distribution, to create a high-resolution bathymetry dataset. The bathymetric data were interpolated on a hybrid curvilinear–unstructured mesh with an anisotropic inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation method. The resulting product offers resolutions ranging from 2 m in a connection zone to 100 m in one of the straight unidirectional channels. Cross-validation of the dataset underlined the importance of the data source spatial pattern, with average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.55 %, 6.3 %, and 27.6 % for river segments covered by the densest to coarsest datasets. These error rates are comparable to those observed in bathymetry interpolation in rivers with similar source datasets. The bathymetry presented in this study is the first unique, high-resolution, comprehensive, and easily accessible bathymetric model covering all three branches of the Danube Delta. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14055741 (Alaerts et al., 2024)."

By offering a way for computer models to be tested against real-world lake data, LakeBeD-US offers opportunities for both sciences to grow and to give new insights into the causes of water quality changes. 
 Water quality in lakes is an emergent property of complex biotic and abiotic processes that differ across spatial and temporal scales. Water quality is also a determinant of ecosystem services that lakes provide and is thus of great interest to ecologists. Machine learning and other computer science techniques are increasingly being used to predict water quality dynamics as well as to gain a greater understanding of water quality patterns and controls. To benefit the sciences of both ecology and computer science, we have created a benchmark dataset of lake water quality time series and vertical profiles. LakeBeD-US contains over 500 million unique observations of lake water quality collected by multiple long-term monitoring programs across 17 water quality variables from 21 lakes in the United States. There are two published versions of LakeBeD-US: the “Ecology Edition” published in the Environmental Data Initiative repository (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/c56a204a65483790f6277de4896d7140, McAfee et al., 2024) and the “Computer Science Edition” published in the Hugging Face repository (https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/3771, Pradhan et al., 2024). Each edition is formatted in a manner conducive to inquiries and analyses specific to each domain. For ecologists, LakeBeD-US: Ecology Edition provides an opportunity to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of several lakes with varying water quality, ecosystem, and landscape characteristics. For computer scientists, LakeBeD-US: Computer Science Edition acts as a benchmark dataset that enables the advancement of machine learning for water quality prediction."

Here we create an automatic workflow using machine and deep learning techniques to process five years of data in the western coast of South America. This allows us to detect smaller earthquakes than before, creating a catalogue of seismicity that contains far more events than other regional catalogues. 
 In this study we process 5 years of continuous seismic data, from 2017 to 2021, recorded by networks deployed along the Chilean convergent margin of western South America. We select a set of stations so that coverage is as continuous and consistent in time as possible. Thus, changes in the catalogue are mainly due to the processes responsible for the seismicity itself and not network artifacts. For phase picking, we use the deep-learning algorithm Earthquake Transformer, PyOcto for association, NonLinLoc for location and HypoDD for relocation. To handle the large spatial extent of the study area, we create a partitioning workflow that mitigates problems that arise from associator and location codes working in cartesian coordinates. This allows us to obtain a main seismicity catalogue with over 600.000 double-difference relocated events and a completeness magnitude of ~2.5, with events located using an existing 3D velocity model. While this provides better location accuracy than a 1D or 2D velocity model, it limits the final catalogue to the extent of the 3D velocity model which does not cover our whole study area. Therefore, we create a secondary seismicity catalogue for the region to the south of the 3D model. Our catalogues provide a dense, high-resolution dataset, with large spatial extent, for the interpretation of seismic processes along the western South American Margin."

The database includes over 71 000 nitrogen isotope records from 424 studies, along with essential geological context and related chemical data. This database will help reveal the mechanisms behind critical events like mass extinctions and major ocean changes, enhancing our understanding of Earth's long-term environmental processes. 
 Stable nitrogen isotope records preserved in marine sediments provide critical insights into Earth’s climate history and biospheric evolution. Although numerous studies have documented nitrogen isotope (δ15N) records across varied geological ages (Archean to Recent) and paleogeographic settings, the scientific community remains constrained by the absence of a standardized database to systematically investigate their spatiotemporal evolution. Here, we present the database of Deep-time Sediment Nitrogen Isotopes in Marine Systems (DSMS-NI), a comprehensive global compilation of δ15N data and associated geochemical parameters, spanning a vast collection of sediment samples dating from the Recent to the Archean. This database encompasses 71 040 δ15N records derived from 424 publications, systematically organized with 29 metadata fields categories (e.g., chronostratigraphic ages, coordinates, lithology, metamorphic grade, sedimentary facies, references) encompassing 1 927 829 metadata. This repository further incorporates 130 proxy data fields, including 285 715 geochemical data spanning total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and organic carbon isotopes (δ13Corg), major and trace elements and iron species. These integrated parameters enable evaluation of sample fidelity and factors influencing δ15N signatures. The DSMS-NI database will facilitate research across key geological intervals such as the Permian-Triassic boundary and the Cretaceous ocean anoxic events. Researchers can leverage temporal and paleogeographic information, alongside geochemical data, to conduct spatiotemporal analyses, thereby uncovering changes in deep-time marine nitrogen cycles and paleoenvironmental conditions. The database is open-access via the Geobiology portal (https://geobiologydata.cug.edu.cn/, last access: 30 April 2025), allowing users to access data and submit new entries to ensure continuous updates and expansion. This resource represents a vital foundation for studies in paleoclimate, paleoenvironment, and geochemistry, offering essential data for understanding long-term Earth-system processes.

Sandborn,Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic  Carbon Estimation (TRACE),"We infer ocean gas exchange and circulation from ocean tracer measurements and use this to create code to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean that is there due to human emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. The code works across the ocean depths for the past, present, or future from information about the location, temperature, and salinity of the seawater. We produce a data product with estimates throughout the ocean throughout the last ~300 and the next ~500 years. 
 The ocean is one of the largest sinks for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (Canth) and its removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere has been valued at hundreds of billions to trillions of US dollars in climate mitigation annually. The ecosystem impacts caused by planet-wide shifts in ocean chemistry resulting from marine Canth accumulation are an active area of research. For these reasons, we need accessible tools to quantify ocean Canth inventories and distributions and to predict how they might evolve in response to future emissions and mitigation activities. Unfortunately, Canth estimation methods are typically only accessible to trained scientists and modelers with access to significant computational resources. Here, we make modifications to the transit time distribution approach for Canth estimation that render the method more accessible. We also release software (BRCScienceProducts, 2025) called “Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic Carbon Estimation version 1” (TRACEv1) that allows users – with one line of code – to obtain Canth and water mass age estimates throughout the global open ocean from user-supplied values of geographic location, pressure, salinity, temperature, and the estimate year. We use this code to generate a data product of global gridded open-ocean Canth distributions (TRACEv1_GGCanth; Carter, 2025) that ranges from the preindustrial era through 2500 under a range of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs, or atmospheric CO2 concentration pathways). We estimated the skill of these estimates by reconstructing Canth in models with known distributions of Canth and transient tracers and by conducting perturbation tests. In the model-based reconstruction test, TRACEv1 reproduces the global ocean Canth inventory to within ±10 % in 1980 and 2014. We discuss implications and limitations of the projected Canth distributions and highlight ways that the estimation strategy might be improved. One finding is that the ocean will continue to increase its net Canth inventory at least through 2500 due to deep-ocean ventilation, even with the SSP in which intense mitigation successfully decreases atmospheric Canth by ∼60 % in 2500 relative to the 2024 concentration. A notable limitation of this and similar projections made with TRACEv1 is that ongoing and potential future warming and changing oceanic circulation patterns with climate change are not captured by the method.

 The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the “Asian Water Tower”, plays a critical role in the regulation of the water cycle in the region. Obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution, and all-weather total precipitable water (TPW) data is essential for understanding water vapor transport mechanisms, improving precipitation forecasting, and managing regional water resources over the TP. However, existing single-sensor remote sensing techniques cannot provide high spatiotemporal resolution TPW data under cloudy conditions. Multi-source fusion approaches often produce anomalous distributions in the fused TPW data due to inter-sensor biases, particularly over the complex terrain of the TP. This study proposed a multi-source remote sensing TPW fusion framework that integrates TPW products from eight microwave satellites and the Himawari-8/9 (H8/9) geostationary satellite to produce an all-weather TPW data with the highest spatiotemporal resolution at present. Methodologically, two correction strategies were developed. First, a bias correction approach was proposed using H8/9 TPW data as a reference to calibrate multi-source microwave remote sensing TPW and reduce inter-sensor discrepancies. Second, an adaptive correction method was created to improve the accuracy and spatial continuity of the fused TPW data under cloudy conditions. Based on the newly developed fusion framework, an all-weather TPW dataset with hourly temporal and 0.02° spatial resolution covering the TP from 2016 to 2022 was produced for the first time. The new dataset has been published by the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center and is available at: https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301518. Taking the 2017 product as an example, it was verified against GNSS TPW. The RMSE of the fused TPW product at the hourly scale was 3.79 mm, which was 10.82 % and 6.19 % lower than MIMIC-TPW2 and ERA5, respectively. Compared to ERA5 with a spatial resolution of 0.25°, the fused product achieves a 12.5-fold improvement in spatial resolution, which make it possible to significantly grasp the transportation of water vapor in the valley of Yarlung Zsangbo River. It also demonstrates higher reliability in station-sparse regions, providing high-quality, high-resolution vapor data to support vapor flux estimation and forecasting of extreme weather events over the TP."

Keenan,CEDAR-GPP: spatiotemporally upscaled estimates of gross primary productivity incorporating CO2 fertilization,"CEDAR-GPP provides spatiotemporally upscaled estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) globally, uniquely incorporating the direct effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis. This dataset was produced by upscaling eddy covariance data with machine learning and a broad range of satellite and climate variables. Available at monthly and 0.05° resolution from 1982 to 2020, CEDAR-GPP offers critical insights into ecosystem–climate interactions and the global carbon cycle. 
 Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the largest carbon flux in the Earth system, playing a crucial role in removing atmospheric carbon dioxide and providing carbohydrates needed for ecosystem metabolism. Despite the importance of GPP, however, existing estimates present significant uncertainties and discrepancies. A key issue is the underrepresentation of the CO2 fertilization effect, a major factor contributing to the increased terrestrial carbon sink over recent decades. This omission could potentially bias our understanding of ecosystem responses to climate change.Here, we introduce CEDAR-GPP, the first global machine-learning-upscaled GPP product that incorporates the direct CO2 fertilization effect on photosynthesis. Our product is comprised of monthly GPP estimates and their uncertainty at 0.05° resolution from 1982 to 2020, generated using a comprehensive set of eddy covariance measurements, multi-source satellite observations, climate variables, and machine learning models. Importantly, we used both theoretical and data-driven approaches to incorporate the direct CO2 effects. Our machine learning models effectively predict monthly GPP (R2 ∼ 0.72), the mean seasonal cycles (R2 ∼ 0.77), and spatial variabilities (R2 ∼ 0.63) based on cross-validation at flux sites. After incorporating the direct CO2 effects, the predicted long-term GPP trend across global flux towers substantially increases from 3.1 to 4.5–5.4 gC m−2 yr−1, which aligns more closely with the 7.7 gC m−2 yr−1 trend detected from eddy covariance data. While the global patterns of annual mean GPP, seasonality, and interannual variability generally align with existing satellite-based products, CEDAR-GPP demonstrates higher long-term trends globally after incorporating CO2 fertilization and reflected a strong temperature control on direct CO2 effects. The estimated global GPP trend is 0.57–0.76 PgC yr−1 from 2001 to 2018 and 0.32–0.34 PgC yr−1 from 1982 to 2018. Estimating and validating GPP trends in data-scarce regions, such as the tropics, remains challenging, underscoring the importance of ongoing ground-based monitoring and advancements in modeling techniques. CEDAR-GPP offers a comprehensive representation of GPP temporal and spatial dynamics, providing valuable insights into ecosystem–climate interactions.

 This work documents the operation of a new submodel for tracer emissions from Explosive Volcanic ERuptions (EVER v1.1), developed within the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy, version 2.55.1). EVER calculates additional tendencies of gaseous and aerosol tracers based on emission source parameters, aligned to specific sequences of volcanic eruptions or other atmospheric emission sources and allowing various vertical emission profiles. We show that volcanic SO2 plumes can be reasonably reproduced through EVER emissions in numerical simulations with the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry Model (EMAC), using satellite observations of SO2 columns and mixing ratios following the explosive eruption of the Nabro volcano (Eritrea) in 2011 and a degassing event of the Kilauea volcano (2018) in Hawaii. Previous volcanic studies have shown large variability in stratospheric SO2 burdens depending on the chosen volcanic emission databases and parameters. Sensitivity studies on SO2 emissions from the Nabro volcano explore perturbations of the emission source parameters, revealing that emission altitude and the emitted mass above the tropopause are most important for the mid- to long-term evolution of stratospheric SO2 plumes and the resulting stratospheric aerosol, while the correct timing and geographical location of the stratospheric entrance are crucial for the short-term plume evolution. We integrate information from a volcanic SO2 emission inventory, additional satellite observations, and our findings from the sensitivity studies to establish a historical standard setup for volcanic eruptions impacting stratospheric SO2 from 1990 to 2023. This setup was successfully evaluated with satellite observations of stratospheric SO2 burden and aerosol optical properties. We advocate for this to be a standardized setup in all simulations within the MESSy framework concentrating on the upper troposphere and stratosphere in this period. Further potential applications of EVER involve studies on volcanic ash, wildfires, solar radiation modification, and atmospheric transport processes."

In this paper we develop a method that identifies whether different parts of a glacier require high or low resolution based on its physical features, such as its thickness and velocity. We show that by doing so we can achieve a more optimal simulation accuracy for the available computing resources compared to uniform-resolution simulations. 
 Glaciological modelling is a computationally challenging task due to its high cost and complexity associated with large spatial-scale and long timescale simulations. In this paper we propose feature-based anisotropic mesh adaptation methods and demonstrate their effectiveness for time-dependent glaciological modelling on a Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (MISMIP+) experiment. Our methods use the Python-based Firedrake finite element library and the mmg2d remeshing software. We show that we are able to achieve solution accuracy comparable to uniform 0.5 km resolution mesh simulations using a sequence of adapted meshes with, on average, 30 times fewer vertices when adapting meshes based on the basal stress and 8–12 times fewer when adapting based on ice thickness and velocity. We further introduce a novel hybrid time-dependent fixed-point mesh adaptation algorithm that reaches mesh convergence approximately twice as fast compared with the existing global fixed-point algorithm. Since the fixed-point algorithms require that the problem is solved multiple times, the reported reduction in the number of vertices ultimately translates into a 3–6 times lower overall computational cost compared to uniform mesh simulations."

Driven by the need to better understand climate change and its impacts, these models have become increasingly sophisticated over time, generating vast amounts of data. To effectively evaluate the complex state-of-the-art ESMs and ensure their reliability, new tools for comprehensive analysis are essential. The open-source community-driven Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) addresses this critical need by providing a software package for scientists to assess the performance of ESMs using common diagnostics and metrics. In this paper, we describe recent significant improvements of ESMValTool's computational efficiency, which allow a more effective evaluation of these complex ESMs and also high-resolution models. These optimizations include parallel computing (execute multiple computation tasks simultaneously), out-of-core computing (process data larger than available memory), and distributed computing (spread computation tasks across multiple interconnected nodes or machines). When comparing the latest ESMValTool version with a previous not yet optimized version, we find significant performance improvements for many relevant applications running on a single node of a high-performance computing (HPC) system, ranging from 2.3 times faster runs in a multi-model setup up to 23 times faster runs for processing a single high-resolution model. By utilizing distributed computing on two nodes of an HPC system, these speedup factors can be further improved to 3.0 and 44, respectively. Moreover, evaluation runs with the latest version of ESMValTool also require significantly less computational resources than before, which in turn reduces power consumption and thus the overall carbon footprint of ESMValTool runs. For example, the previously mentioned use cases use 2.3 (multi-model evaluation) and 23 (high-resolution model evaluation) times less resources compared to the reference version on one HPC node. Finally, analyses which could previously only be performed on machines with large amounts of memory can now be conducted on much smaller hardware through the use of out-of-core computation. For instance, the high-resolution single-model evaluation use case can now be run with 8 GB of available memory despite an input data size of 35 GB, which was not possible with earlier versions of ESMValTool. This enables running much more complex evaluation tasks on a personal laptop than before."

Nix is a computer programme that simulates the movement and temperature evolution in ice sheets. It helps us study how ice sheets respond to changes in the atmosphere and ocean. We found that ice temperatures play an essential role in determining the motion and stability of ice sheets. Nix is a useful tool for learning how climate change affects polar ice sheets. 
 We present a physical description of the ice-sheet model Nix v1.0, an open-source project intended for collaborative development. Nix is a two-dimensional (flowline combined with a vertical dimension) thermomechanical model written in C and C++ that simultaneously solves for the momentum balance equations, mass conservation and temperature evolution. Nix's velocity solver includes a hierarchy of Stokes approximations: Blatter–Pattyn, depth-integrated higher order and shallow shelf. The grounding-line position is explicitly solved by a moving coordinate system that avoids further interpolations. The model can be easily forced with any external boundary conditions. Nix has been verified for standard test problems, showing versatility from regular machines (lightweight memory allocation) to high-performance computing (multi-threading capabilities). Resolutions below 0.1 km are attainable even with minimal computational resources: Nix's serial run finalizes within hours on a single CPU. Here we show results for a number of benchmark experiments from the Marine Ice Sheet Intercomparison Project (MISMIP) and assess grounding-line migration with an overdeepened bed geometry. Lastly, we further exploit the thermomechanical coupling by designing a suite of experiments where the forcing is a physical variable, unlike previously idealized forcing scenarios where ice temperatures are implicitly fixed via an ice rate factor. That is, we use atmospheric temperature and oceanic temperature anomalies to assess model hysteresis behaviour with active thermodynamics. Our results show that hysteresis in an overdeepened bed geometry is similar for atmospheric and oceanic forcings. Notably, the classical hysteresis loop is widened for both forcing scenarios (i.e. atmospheric and oceanic) if the ice sheet is thermomechanically active as a result of the internal feedback among ice temperature, stress balance and viscosity. These results show that a temperature-dependent ice viscosity provides inertia and stability to the ice sheet, regardless of the particular external forcing applied. In summary, Nix combines rapid computational capabilities with a Blatter–Pattyn stress balance fully coupled to a thermomechanical solver, not only validating against established benchmarks but also offering a powerful tool for advancing our insight into ice dynamics and grounding-line stability."

Using a novel combination of high-frequency photography and fluorescent particles, we compared the transport of three MPs to that of a sand particle during rainfall simulations: linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), polystyrene (PS), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). We measured the “real time” movement of particles on the soil surface alongside the number of particles transported through splash erosion and surface runoff. Our results show that MPs of all polymer types demonstrated more rapid transport from the soil surface compared to sand particles throughout the rainfall simulations. Prior to surface runoff, ∼65–75% of MPs and sand particles were removed from the soil surface through raindrop-driven incorporation into the soil matrix. Surface runoff and splash erosion accounted for the transport of approximately 47% of PMMA and 57% of PS, while only 30% of sand particles were mobilized by these processes. This research establishes a benchmark for evaluating MP mobility to current knowledge of soil particle movement, which is critical for estimating the redistribution of MPs within soils and their ultimate flux to aquatic ecosystems."

Phytotoxic hydrogen sulfides (H2S) and light deprivation are known drivers of seagrass loss worldwide; however, the underlying physiological mechanisms are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we explored the fate of inorganic carbon (Ci) in Halophila ovalis which were exposed to either low light (88% shade), (ii) sediment H2S stress, or (iii) both stressors combined in a mesocosm setting. Using a novel multidisciplinary approach in combination with a 13C tracer (NaH13CO3), we investigated differences in Ci acquisition, metabolite incorporation, and carbon translocation. Ci acquisition into seagrass leaves was impacted by both H2S and low light stress, synergistically reducing carbon acquisition rates by 10.9-fold. The incorporation of 13C into leaf sugar pools was also affected by both stressors. In addition, low light impacted  critical intermediates of both glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Below-ground data suggest that H2S interferes with carbon translocation from the leaf into the rhizome and caused an 85% reduction in rhizome growth, irrespective of light. Overall, this study suggests that it is likely a multilevel (acquisition, metabolism, translocation) disruption of the carbon budget that threatens seagrass health and survival under both H2S and low light stress."

This study investigated the differential impacts of S-nZVI and nZVI on the dechlorination activity of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 (Dhc 195), a representative OHRB. Key factors, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), pH, Fe2+ concentration, and nanoparticle–cell interactions, were assessed. S-nZVI exhibited significantly lower cytotoxicity compared to nZVI, primarily due to the reduced nanoparticle adhesion to Dhc 195 cell membranes, attributed to its negative surface charge rather than to the milder physicochemical disturbances in the culture medium. S-nZVI minimally disrupted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), preserving cell integrity, and provided a more sustained hydrogen supply under hydrogen-limited conditions. Limited contact experiments confirmed that the reduced cytotoxicity of S-nZVI stemmed from lower contact toxicity rather than its intrinsic chemical reactivity. This study unveils the mechanisms underlying the interaction between S-nZVI and OHRB, highlighting S-nZVI’s potential for safer and more effective abiotic–biotic remediation strategies.

However, field data on ARG-MP copollution remain scarce, hindering environmental risk assessment of ARGs. This study used metagenomic sequencing and high-throughput qPCR to examine the composition and association of ARGs and MPs in sewage discharge-receiving waters. The results indicated that sewage discharge significantly increased the abundance of ARG-MP complexes in receiving waters, with fibrous and fragmented MPs exhibiting enhanced ARG enrichment and thereby serving as selective vectors for pathogens. Effluents promoted plasmid-mediated gene transfer and microbial functional shifts, driving intracellular ARG proliferation in the plastisphere. Fibrous and fragmented MPs showed strong co-occurrence patterns with ARGs, virulence factor genes, and mobile genetic elements, suggesting their role in antimicrobial resistance dissemination. A projection pursuit regression model indicated effluent-induced MP risk escalation at the estuary and downstream areas, which was associated with fragmented and polyamide MPs. Notably, WWTPs released substantial extracellular ARGs, with MPs potentially serving as a protective niche and a proliferative microenvironment. Here, we determined the role of WWTPs in shaping the aquatic resistome via MPs, which provides critical data for risk assessment and control strategies."

We therefore developed a new rectangular zero-gap cell design featuring an extended flow path to improve hydrogen retention and conversion to biomethane. Multiphase flow modeling within porous carbon felt cathodes revealed the new configuration with a trapezoidal inlet substantially reduced flow dead zones and tripled hydrogen retention time versus circular cells. At −1 V vs Ag/AgCl, increasing catholyte flow rate from 0.8 to 2.5 mL/min raised current densities from 19 to 24 A/m2 (30 °C), reaching a peak Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82% for methane production (7.0 L/L-d). Further increasing the flow rate to 7.5 mL/min or temperature to 37 °C slightly improved methane production (7.2–7.7 L/L-d) but reduced hydrogen retention in cells based on modeling results, lowering CEs and energy efficiencies due to unreacted hydrogen. Matching cathode potential to flow rates and temperatures could balance H2 production and retention, significantly improving CE to 96% toward 7.5 L/L-d methane production with a high energy efficiency of 36% (−0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl, 37 °C).

While the ecological implications of browning have received considerable attention, its impacts on the photochemical production of reactive intermediates from DOM remain understudied despite their importance for biogeochemical processes and contaminant fate in sunlit surface waters. To address this gap, we investigated singlet oxygen (1O2) production in 37 lakes within the Adirondack Long-Term Monitoring (ALTM) program. Wavelet coherence tests confirmed the synchrony between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and color as well as the time-scale-dependent influence of regional atmospheric and hydroclimatic factors on DOC dynamics in these lakes. Hydrogeological conditions of lake watersheds (e.g., hydrologic connectivity and surficial geology) and seasonal variations in DOM quality jointly shaped the spatiotemporal patterns of the apparent quantum yields of 1O2. Within the euphotic zone, depth-averaged steady-state concentrations of 1O2 were higher in lakes experiencing more intense browning, as operationally defined through trend analyses of long-term water chemistry data; however, the relevance of 1O2-mediated reactions depends on the time scales of photochemical transformation relative to lake flushing.

To illustrate this framework, we used 37, 9, and 28 species-dependent inactivation rate constants for ultraviolet (UV), ozone, and free chlorine, respectively, from systematic reviews. We estimated the sensitivity distributions of these disinfectants by incorporating the uncertainty in the individual inactivation rate constants using a Bayesian framework.

The impacts of aromatics and their oxidation products vary. While the chemistry and major pathways of the precursor aromatics are relatively well understood, the same is not true for their phenolic oxidation products. Here, we use new observations of aromatic oxidation products collected during the Korea‐United States Air Quality aircraft campaign to evaluate the aromatic chemical mechanism in the GEOS‐Chem v13.4.0 chemical transport model. Based on these results, we implement changes to emissions, add ethylbenzene chemistry, and introduce phenol production from ethylbenzene and toluene oxidation. These changes improve simulation of benzene (reducing normalized mean bias from 24% to −9%) and phenol (−71% to −42%). Model biases increase for toluene, xylene, and cresol, but simulated mixing ratios remain within measurement uncertainties and observed interquartile ranges. We identify potential toluene emission overestimates from petrochemical complexes in Ulsan and Daesan and underestimates from the Daegu dyeing industrial complex, and underestimates of benzene emissions from China. Using the updated model, we find benzene and toluene contribute equally to phenol production in the boundary layer (accounting for 40% of phenol production each), and that toluene and ethylbenzene are atmospherically relevant precursors of phenol. Phenol and cresol loss is found to be dominated by OH oxidation (73% for both phenol and cresol). We find that benzaldehyde is the dominant source of nitrophenol production (67%), although phenol dominates nitrophenol production at night."

In this study, we introduce an iterative joint mass balance inversion framework that synthesizes multiconstituent satellite observations, with a particular focus on CrIS isoprene and OMPS formaldehyde (CH2O) column measurements. Our analysis targets East Asia during May–June 2016, using the GEOS‐Chem model. Our joint inversion improves the model performance for both species compared to the satellite observations, as evident from increases in correlation coefficient (R) from 0.37 to 0.70 for isoprene and from 0.90 to 0.92 for CH2O, and reductions of normalized mean bias from −79% to −64% for isoprene and from −23% to −16% for CH2O. In contrast, single‐species inversions of CH2O‐ and isoprene‐alone lead to minor reductions in R for the unobserved species. Cross‐validation with airborne observations highlights the downside of single‐species inversions, showing that the CH2O‐only inversion tends to overfit CH2O and degrade the isoprene simulation, which is mitigated by simultaneously using satellite isoprene observations in the joint inversion. However, uncertainties in satellite isoprene observations limit the benefits of the joint inversion in regions with low concentrations, such as South Korea, due to the detection limits of CrIS isoprene retrievals. Despite this limitation, our joint inversion framework efficiently leverages information from multiple data sets to provide a more comprehensive understanding of VOC emissions, enabling future work to incorporate satellite measurements of additional species such as nitrogen oxides and potentially glyoxal."

The average radiation power densities calculated by Si I and Fe I spectral lines are only around 3.04 × 107 W/m2 and 2.56 × 107 W/m2, which remained basically steady during the stable luminescence stage. The spectral and energy feature indicated that the BL maybe exist a core with higher energy. The radiation power density shows a periodic pulse feature in the energy core and maintains basically stable in the bright periphery with lower energy. The highest energy of this BL can only excite light radiation of the near infrared band from the O I atoms in the air. The BL moved toward the nearby power line. Deduced from the energy distribution and moving direction that this BL should be associated with small gap intermittent discharge at the bottom of previous cloud‐to‐ground (CG) lightning channel, meanwhile, the strong atmospheric electric field during thunderstorm and its distribution should be a potential outside source that drives the discharge and moving direction of this BL.

Yet, the responses of fungal spores—organisms important to ecosystems and major airborne allergens—remain understudied. This knowledge gap limits our understanding of their ecological and public health implications. To address this, we analyzed a long‐term (2003–2022), large‐scale (the continental US) data set of airborne fungal spores collected by the US National Allergy Bureau. We first pre‐processed the spore data by gap‐filling and smoothing. Afterward, we extracted 10 metrics describing the phenology (e.g., start and end of season) and intensity (e.g., peak concentration and integral) of fungal spore seasons. These metrics were derived using two complementary but not mutually exclusive approaches—ecological and public health approaches, defined as percentiles of total spore concentration and allergenic thresholds of spore concentration, respectively. Using linear mixed‐effects models, we quantified annual shifts in these metrics across the continental US. We revealed a significant advancement in the onset of the spore seasons defined in both ecological (11 days, 95% confidence interval: 0.4–23 days) and public health (22 days, 6–38 days) approaches over two decades. Meanwhile, total spore concentrations in an annual cycle and in a spore allergy season tended to decrease over time. The earlier start of the spore season was significantly correlated with climatic variables, such as warmer temperatures and altered precipitations. Overall, our findings suggest possible climate‐driven advanced fungal spore seasons, highlighting the importance of climate change mitigation and adaptation in public health decision‐making."

Mild oxidation leads to intermediate borinic esters6, which can be isolated and purified or reacted directly in a range of transformations, including cross-couplings and homologation reactions. In particular, subjecting the intermediate borinic esters to Zweifel7,8 olefination conditions can give either retention or inversion of the double-bond geometry, depending on whether base is present or not. Different positional and stereoisomers of the tetrasubstituted alkenes can be easily accessed, highlighting the breadth and versatility of the method. This was showcased through its successful application to the rapid synthesis of drug molecules and natural products with high yield and stereocontrol.

 Natural chiral polymers, such as DNA, proteins, cellulose and poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] ((R)-P3HB), are prevalent in their enantiopure forms1,2. Existing methods to synthesize enantiopure polymers focus on enantiospecific polymerization, in which only one specific enantiomer is obtained from the corresponding chiral monomer3–6. Here we introduce a catalytic stereodivergent synthetic strategy to access all enantiopure di-isotactic poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) diastereomers from bacterial (R)-P3HB as the single chiral source. A series of enantiopure (R,R)-α-alkylated-β-butyrolactones are obtained from (R)-P3HB and then subjected to the catalyst-controlled diastereodivergent ring-opening polymerization (ROP) to enantiopure di-isotactic α-alkylated PHAs. Metal-catalysed coordination–insertion ROP results in threo-(R,R)-di-isotactic PHAs with chiral retention, whereas anionic ROP catalysed by an organic superbase produces erythro-(R,S)-di-isotactic PHAs with chiral inversion, achieving precision di-isotactic PHAs with exclusive regio- and stereoregularity. This strategy has also enabled the stereodivergent synthesis of all four [(R,R), (S,S), (R,S) and (S,R)] stereoisomers of α,α-dialkylated PHAs from (R)-P3HB, which can be depolymerized to chiral α,α-dialkylated-β-butyrolactones with high stereoselectivity. Overall, this catalyst-controlled regio- and stereoselective, stereodivergent synthetic methodology provides access to 16 enantiopure stereoisomers of α(α)-(di)substituted PHAs and enables the stereochemistry-defined structure–property relationship study of the di-isotactic PHAs, providing insights into the effects of main-chain stereoconfigurations and alkyl side chains on their thermal properties, melt processability, mechanical performance and supramolecular stereocomplexation.

 In a classic example of adaptation, harmless Batesian mimics gain protection from predators through resemblance to one or more unpalatable models1,2. Mimics vary greatly in accuracy, and explaining the persistence of inaccurate mimics is an ongoing challenge for evolutionary biologists3,4. Empirical testing of existing hypotheses is constrained by the difficulty of assessing the fitness of phenotypes absent among extant species, leaving large parts of the adaptive landscape unexplored5—a problem affecting the study of the evolution of most complex traits. Here, to address this, we created mimetic phenotypes that occupy hypothetical areas of trait space by morphing between 3D images of real insects (flies and wasps), and tested the responses of real predators to high-resolution, full-colour 3D-printed reproductions of these phenotypes. We found that birds have an excellent ability to learn to discriminate among insects on the basis of subtle differences in appearance, but this ability is weaker for pattern and shape than for colour and size traits. We found that mimics gained no special protection from intermediate resemblance to multiple model phenotypes. However, discrimination ability was lower in some invertebrate predators (especially crab spiders and mantises), highlighting that the predator community is key to explaining the apparent inaccuracy of many mimics. Birds have an excellent ability to learn to discriminate harmless insects from those that they mimic on the basis of subtle differences in appearance."

 Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that non-selectively preys on Gram-negative bacteria by invading the prey-cell periplasm, leaching host nutrients and ultimately lysing the infected cell to exit and find a new host1,2. The predatory life cycle of B. bacteriovorus is, in many ways, comparable to a bacteriophage. However, unlike phage defence, defence against B. bacteriovorus has not been widely investigated. Here we screened a collection of diverse Escherichia coli strains for resistance to B. bacteriovorus and identified that roughly one-third of strains robustly defended against predation by producing curli fibres. Curli fibres are oligomers of the functional amyloid protein CsgA, which is exceptionally durable3. Using genetics and microscopy, we demonstrate that curli fibres provide a barrier that protects susceptible cells independent of genes required for biofilm formation. This barrier further protected E. coli against attack by the predatory bacterium Myxococcus xanthus and select phages. Bioinformatic analysis of bacterial amyloids showed these systems are diverse and widespread in diderm bacteria (those with both inner and outer membranes). One of these, an evolutionarily distinct amyloid encoded by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also protected against B. bacteriovorus. This work establishes that functional amyloids defend bacteria against a wide range of threats. Escherichia coli uses curli fibres, oligomers of the functional amyloid CsgA, as a barrier to protect against the predatory bacteria Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and Myxococcus xanthus in a mechanism that is independent of genes required for biofilm formation."

 From fertilization onwards, the cells of the human body acquire variations in their DNA sequence, known as somatic mutations. These postzygotic mutations arise from intrinsic errors in DNA replication and repair, as well as from exposure to mutagens. Somatic mutations have been implicated in some diseases, but a fundamental understanding of the frequency, type and patterns of mutations across healthy human tissues has been limited. This is primarily due to the small proportion of cells harbouring specific somatic variants within an individual, making them more challenging to detect than inherited variants. Here we describe the Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues Network, which aims to create a reference catalogue of somatic mutations and their clonal patterns across 19 different tissue sites from 150 non-diseased donors and develop new technologies and computational tools to detect somatic mutations and assess their phenotypic consequences, including clonal expansions. This strategy enables a comprehensive examination of the mutational landscape across the human body, and provides a comparison baseline for somatic mutation in diseases. This will lead to a deep understanding of somatic mutations and clonal expansions across the lifespan, as well as their roles in health, in ageing and, by comparison, in diseases.

 Biomolecular condensates are key features of intracellular compartmentalization1,2. As the most prominent nuclear condensate in eukaryotes, the nucleolus is a multiphase liquid-like structure in which ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed and processed, undergoing multiple maturation steps to form the small (SSU) and large (LSU) ribosomal subunits3–5. However, how rRNA processing is coupled to the layered organization of the nucleolus is poorly understood owing to a lack of tools to precisely monitor and perturb nucleolar rRNA processing dynamics. Here we developed two complementary approaches to spatiotemporally map rRNA processing and engineer de novo nucleoli. Using sequencing in parallel with imaging, we found that rRNA processing steps are spatially segregated, with sequential maturation of rRNA required for its outward movement through nucleolar phases. By generating synthetic nucleoli in cells using an engineered rDNA plasmid system, we show that defects in SSU processing can alter the ordering of nucleolar phases, resulting in inside-out nucleoli and preventing rRNA outflux, while LSU precursors are necessary to build the outermost layer of the nucleolus. These findings demonstrate how rRNA is both a scaffold and substrate for the nucleolus, with rRNA acting as a programmable blueprint for the multiphase architecture that facilitates assembly of an essential molecular machine. Spatially segregated rRNA processing dictates nucleolar morphology and drives outward progression of pre-ribosomal RNA through nucleolar phases."

 Climate assessments of civil aviation1,2 have consistently quantified the dominant climate-forcing components: (1) CO2 emissions, (2) NOx (NO + NO2) emissions and (3) persistent contrails. All three components exert a positive radiative forcing (RF) and lead to climate warming of similar magnitudes. The aviation community is actively seeking to reduce its climate footprint through advanced engine technologies, more sustainable aviation fuel and optimal routing plans3–12. These approaches usually involve a trade-off of CO2 against NOx or contrails (non-CO2), such as burning 1% more fuel to decrease contrail RF by 4%. Here, we show that a climate-trade-off risk curve derived from uncertainties in the RF components2,13–16 can give the probability that a specified trade-off ratio will produce a climate benefit. For each component, we calculate the integrated effective RF resulting from 1 year of flights: global warming per activity (GWA). The complementary cumulative probability distribution of the GWA(non-CO2) to GWA(CO2) ratio results in a climate-trade-off risk curve giving the likelihood of a positive climate outcome as a function of the trade-off-CO2 to trade-off-non-CO2 ratio, because the product, GWA × trade-off, should be the same for both. We find a likely (67%) chance of climate mitigation on a 100-year time horizon for the above suggested ratio of 1:4, favouring proposed non-CO2 mitigation efforts3–12 with ratios smaller than this. A climate-trade-off risk curve derived from uncertainties in the radiative-forcing components indicates that focusing on reducing contrails or nitrogen oxide emissions is more effective than reducing CO2 emissions."

 Classical mechanics characterizes the kinetic energy of a particle, the energy it holds due to its motion, as consistently positive. By contrast, quantum mechanics describes the motion of particles using wave functions, in which regions of negative local kinetic energy can emerge1. This phenomenon occurs when the amplitude of the wave function experiences notable decay, typically associated with quantum tunnelling. Here, we investigate the quantum mechanical motion of particles in a system of two coupled waveguides, in which the population transfer between the waveguides acts as a clock, allowing particle speeds along the waveguide axis to be determined. By applying this scheme to exponentially decaying quantum states at a reflective potential step, we determine an energy–speed relationship for particles with negative local kinetic energy. We find that the smaller the energy of the particles—in other words, the more negative the local kinetic energy—the higher the measured speed inside the potential step. Our findings contribute to the ongoing tunnelling time debate2–6 and can be viewed as a test of Bohmian trajectories in quantum mechanics7–9. Regarding the latter, we find that the measured energy–speed relationship does not align with the particle dynamics postulated by the guiding equation in Bohmian mechanics. The study of the relationship between particle speed and negative kinetic energy, arising in regions in which, according to classical mechanics, particles are not allowed to enter, reveals behaviour that appears to contradict the predictions of Bohmian mechanics."

 Although most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range1. The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer–promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in vivo enhancer-replacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and medium-range limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis-acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1. The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh2. The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer–promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers. The REX element is associated with long-range enhancer–promoter interactions."

 The North Eurasian forest and forest-steppe zones have sustained millennia of sociocultural connections among northern peoples, but much of their history is poorly understood. In particular, the genomic formation of populations that speak Uralic and Yeniseian languages today is unknown. Here, by generating genome-wide data for 180 ancient individuals spanning this region, we show that the Early-to-Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers harboured a continuous gradient of ancestry from fully European-related in the Baltic, to fully East Asian-related in the Transbaikal. Contemporaneous groups in Northeast Siberia were off-gradient and descended from a population that was the primary source for Native Americans, which then mixed with populations of Inland East Asia and the Amur River Basin to produce two populations whose expansion coincided with the collapse of pre-Bronze Age population structure. Ancestry from the first population, Cis-Baikal Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Cisbaikal_LNBA), is associated with Yeniseian-speaking groups and those that admixed with them, and ancestry from the second, Yakutia Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Yakutia_LNBA), is associated with migrations of prehistoric Uralic speakers. We show that Yakutia_LNBA first dispersed westwards from the Lena River Basin around 4,000 years ago into the Altai-Sayan region and into West Siberian communities associated with Seima-Turbino metallurgy—a suite of advanced bronze casting techniques that expanded explosively from the Altai1. The 16 Seima-Turbino period individuals were diverse in their ancestry, also harbouring DNA from Indo-Iranian-associated pastoralists and from a range of hunter-gatherer groups. Thus, both cultural transmission and migration were key to the Seima-Turbino phenomenon, which was involved in the initial spread of early Uralic-speaking communities.

 Ultimate limits for the sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor1–3. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits4–7. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for several applications. Here we demonstrate a tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative-mass or positive-mass oscillator, we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble enables targeting quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational-wave detectors (GWDs). Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.

 Methanogenic archaea are the main producers of the potent greenhouse gas methane1,2. In the methanogenic pathway from CO2 and H2 studied under laboratory conditions, low-potential electrons for CO2 reduction are generated by a flavin-based electron-bifurcation reaction catalysed by heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) complexed with the associated [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Mvh)3–5. F420-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Frh) provides electrons to the methanogenic pathway through the electron carrier F420 (ref. 6). Here we report that under strictly nickel-limited conditions, in which the nickel concentration is similar to those often observed in natural habitats7–11, the production of both [NiFe]-hydrogenases in Methanothermobacter marburgensis is strongly downregulated. The Frh reaction is substituted by a coupled reaction with [Fe]-hydrogenase (Hmd), and the role of Mvh is taken over by F420-dependent electron-donating proteins (Elp). Thus, Hmd provides all electrons for the reducing metabolism under these nickel-limited conditions. Biochemical and structural characterization of Elp–Hdr complexes confirms the electronic interaction between Elp and Hdr. The conservation of the genes encoding Elp and Hmd in CO2-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens suggests that the Hmd system is an alternative pathway for electron flow in CO2-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens under nickel-limited conditions. Two distantly related methanogens shift the methanogenic pathway under nickel limitation, suggesting that methanogens adapt to changing bioavailability of nickel by rerouting electron flow between two different pathways."

 The efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in solid tumours is limited by immunosuppression and antigen heterogeneity1–3. To overcome these barriers, ‘armoured’ CAR T cells, which secrete proinflammatory cytokines, have been developed4. However, their clinical application has been limited because of toxicity related to peripheral expression of the armouring transgene5. Here, we have developed a CRISPR knock-in strategy that leverages the regulatory mechanisms of endogenous genes to drive transgene expression in a tumour-localized manner. By screening endogenous genes with tumour-restricted expression, we have identified the NR4A2 and RGS16 promoters as promising candidates to support the delivery of cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-2 directly to the tumour site, leading to enhanced antitumour efficacy and long-term survival of mice in both syngeneic and xenogeneic models. This effect was concomitant with improved CAR T cell polyfunctionality, activation of endogenous antitumour immunity and a favourable safety profile, and was applicable in CAR T cells from patients. A CRISPR knock-in strategy that uses endogenous gene regulatory mechanisms can engineer ‘armoured’ CAR T cells that secrete proinflammatory cytokines directly within a tumour without causing toxicity, leading to prolonged survival in mice."

 Social interaction can be regarded as a dynamic feedback loop between interacting individuals as they act and react to each other1,2. Here, to understand the neural basis of these interactions, we investigated inter-brain neural dynamics across individuals in both mice and artificial intelligence systems. By measuring activities of molecularly defined neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of socially interacting mice, we find that the multi-dimensional neural space within each individual can be partitioned into two distinct subspaces—a shared neural subspace that represents shared neural dynamics across animals and a unique neural subspace that represents activity unique to each animal. Notably, compared with glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex contain a considerably larger shared neural subspace, which arises from behaviours of both self and others. We extended this framework to artificial intelligence agents and observed that, as social interactions emerged, so too did shared neural dynamics between interacting agents. Importantly, selectively disrupting the neural components that contribute to shared neural dynamics substantially reduces the agents’ social actions. Our findings suggest that shared neural dynamics represent a fundamental and generalizable feature of interacting neural systems present in both biological and artificial agents and highlight the functional significance of shared neural dynamics in driving social interactions. Shared inter-brain neural dynamics, reflecting aspects of social interaction including self and other’s behaviours, arise in GABAergic neurons of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of socially interacting mice, as well as in the neurons of socially interacting artificial intelligence agents."

 In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines1. The interaction can enhance the magnetic activity of the star, such as its chromospheric2 and radio3 emission or flaring4. So far, the search for magnetic star–planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here we report the detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets5,6. Combining space-borne photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and dedicated Characterising Exoplanets Telescope observations over 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the transit phase of the innermost planet, indicating persistent magnetic star–planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six times higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the remarkably extended atmosphere of the planet, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope7. HIP 67522 is, therefore, an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star–planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.

 Establishing a unified theory of cognition has been an important goal in psychology1,2. A first step towards such a theory is to create a computational model that can predict human behaviour in a wide range of settings. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behaviour in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art language model on a large-scale dataset called Psych-101. Psych-101 has an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from more than 60,000 participants performing in excess of 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behaviour of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but it also generalizes to previously unseen cover stories, structural task modifications and entirely new domains. Furthermore, the model’s internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after fine-tuning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behaviour across a wide range of domains. We believe that such models provide tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories, and we present a case study to demonstrate this.

 Acute inflammation is an essential response that our bodies use to combat infections1. However, in the absence of infections, chronic inflammation can have a pivotal role in the onset and progression of chronic diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, autoimmune disorders, metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and most ageing-associated pathologies2,3. The underlying mechanisms that distinguish chronic inflammation from its acute counterpart remain unclear, posing challenges to the development of targeted therapies for these major diseases. Here we identify a mechanism that separates the two responses: during chronic but not acute inflammation, chromatin remodelling is influenced by nuclear autophagy, in which the WSTF protein of the ISWI chromatin-remodelling complex interacts with the ATG8 autophagy protein family in the nucleus. This interaction leads to WSTF nuclear export and subsequent degradation by autophagosomes and lysosomes in the cytoplasm. Loss of WSTF leads to chromatin opening over inflammatory genes, amplifying inflammation. Cell-penetrating peptides that block the WSTF–ATG8 interaction do not affect acute inflammation but suppress chronic inflammation in senescence as well as in MASH and osteoarthritis in mouse models and patient samples. The ability to specifically target chronic inflammation without blunting acute inflammation offers an approach for treating common chronic inflammatory diseases. During chronic but not acute inflammation, chromatin remodelling is influenced by nuclear autophagy through WSTF interaction with ATG8 in the nucleus, leading to WSTF nuclear export and its subsequent degradation."

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is effective against many cancers, although resistance remains a major issue and new strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes1–5. Here we studied ICB response in a cohort of patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma—a cancer type that poses considerable clinical challenges and lacks effective therapies6–8. We observed significantly prolonged overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with tumours with PPP2R1A mutations. Importantly, our findings were validated in additional ICB-treated patient cohorts across multiple cancer types. Translational analyses from tumour biopsies demonstrated enhanced IFNγ signalling, and the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures at the baseline, as well as enhanced immune infiltration and expansion of CD45RO+CD8+ T cells in the tumour neighbourhood after ICB treatment in PPP2R1A-mutated tumours. Parallel preclinical investigations showed that targeting PPP2R1A (by pharmacological inhibition or genetic modifications) in in vitro and in vivo models was associated with improved survival in the setting of treatment with several forms of immunotherapy, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and ICB. The results from these studies suggest that therapeutic targeting of PPP2R1A may represent an effective strategy to improve patient outcomes after ICB or other forms of immunotherapy, although additional mechanistic and therapeutic insights are needed.

 Understanding how animals and humans learn from experience to make adaptive decisions is a fundamental goal of neuroscience and psychology. Normative modelling frameworks such as Bayesian inference1 and reinforcement learning2 provide valuable insights into the principles governing adaptive behaviour. However, the simplicity of these frameworks often limits their ability to capture realistic biological behaviour, leading to cycles of handcrafted adjustments that are prone to researcher subjectivity. Here we present a novel modelling approach that leverages recurrent neural networks to discover the cognitive algorithms governing biological decision-making. We show that neural networks with just one to four units often outperform classical cognitive models and match larger neural networks in predicting the choices of individual animals and humans, across six well-studied reward-learning tasks. Critically, we can interpret the trained networks using dynamical systems concepts, enabling a unified comparison of cognitive models and revealing detailed mechanisms underlying choice behaviour. Our approach also estimates the dimensionality of behaviour3 and offers insights into algorithms learned by meta-reinforcement learning artificial intelligence agents. Overall, we present a systematic approach for discovering interpretable cognitive strategies in decision-making, offering insights into neural mechanisms and a foundation for studying healthy and dysfunctional cognition. Modelling biological decision-making with tiny recurrent neural networks enables more accurate predictions of animal choices than classical cognitive models and offers insights into the underlying cognitive strategies and neural mechanisms."

Zhou,Carbonate formation and fluctuating habitability on Mars,"A modelling study suggests that Mars had a desert-like climate with intermittent liquid-water oases regulated by a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation. 
 The cause of Mars’s loss of surface habitability is unclear, with isotopic data suggesting a ‘missing sink’ of carbonate1. Past climates with surface and shallow-subsurface liquid water are recorded by Mars’s sedimentary rocks, including strata in the approximately 4-km-thick record at Gale Crater2. Those waters were intermittent, spatially patchy and discontinuous, and continued remarkably late in Mars’s history3—attributes that can be understood if, as on Earth, sedimentary-rock formation sequestered carbon dioxide as abundant carbonate (recently confirmed in situ at Gale4). Here we show that a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation can explain the existence of intermittent Martian oases. In our model, increasing solar luminosity promoted the stability of liquid water, which in turn formed carbonate, reduced the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide and limited liquid water5. Chaotic orbital forcing modulated wet–dry cycles. The negative feedback restricted liquid water to oases and Mars self-regulated as a desert planet. We model snowmelt as the water source, but the feedback can also work with groundwater as the water source. Model output suggests that Gale faithfully records the expected primary episodes of liquid water stability in the surface and near-surface environment. Eventually, atmospheric thickness approaches water’s triple point, curtailing the sustained stability of liquid water and thus habitability in the surface environment. We assume that the carbonate content found at Gale is representative, and as a result we present a testable idea rather than definitive evidence. A modelling study suggests that Mars had a desert-like climate with intermittent liquid-water oases regulated by a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation."

 Thermal nanophotonics enables fundamental breakthroughs across technological applications from energy technology to information processing1–11. From thermal emitters to thermophotovoltaics and thermal camouflage, precise spectral engineering has been bottlenecked by trial-and-error approaches. Concurrently, machine learning has demonstrated its powerful capabilities in the design of nanophotonic and meta-materials12–18. However, it remains a considerable challenge to develop a general design methodology for tailoring high-performance nanophotonic emitters with ultrabroadband control and precise band selectivity, as they are constrained by predefined geometries and materials, local optimization traps and traditional algorithms. Here we propose an unconventional machine learning-based paradigm that can design a multitude of ultrabroadband and band-selective thermal meta-emitters by realizing multiparameter optimization with sparse data that encompasses three-dimensional structural complexity and material diversity. Our framework enables dual design capabilities: (1) it automates the inverse design of a vast number of possible metastructure and material combinations for spectral tailoring; (2) it has an unprecedented ability to design various three-dimensional meta-emitters by applying a three-plane modelling method that transcends the limitations of traditional, flat, two-dimensional structures. We present seven proof-of-concept meta-emitters that exhibit superior optical and radiative cooling performance surpassing current state-of-the-art designs. We provide a generalizable framework for fabricating three-dimensional nanophotonic materials, which facilitates global optimization through expanded geometric freedom and dimensionality and a comprehensive materials database.

 AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain1. Assembled from combinations of four core subunits, GluA1-4, and ~20 auxiliary subunits, their molecular diversity tunes information transfer and storage in a brain circuit-specific manner. GluA3, a subtype strongly associated with disease2, functions as both a fast transmitting Ca2+-permeable (CP) AMPAR at sensory synapses3, and as a Ca2+-impermeable (CI) receptor at cortical synapses4,5. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the CP GluA3 homomer, which substantially diverge from other AMPARs. The GluA3 extracellular domain tiers (NTD and LBD) are closely coupled throughout gating states, creating previously unseen interfaces that impact signalling and harbour human disease mutations. Central to this architecture is a stacking interaction between two arginine residues (Arg163) in the NTD dimer interface, trapping a unique NTD dimer conformation that enables close contacts with the LBD. Rupture of the Arg163 stack not only alters the structure and dynamics of the GluA3 extracellular region, but also increases receptor trafficking, and the expression of GluA3 heteromers at the synapse. We further show that a mammalian-specific GluA3 trafficking checkpoint determines conformational stability of the LBD tier. Hence, specific design features define communication and biogenesis of GluA3, offering a framework to interrogate this disease-prone glutamate receptor."

Electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations suggest disruption of this bond is a key component of channel opening during inhibitory synaptic signaling in the brain. 
 GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors throughout the central nervous system. Genetic mutations causing their dysfunction are related to a broad spectrum of human disorders such as epilepsy, neurodevelopment and intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and depression. GABAARs are also important drug targets for anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and anesthetics. Despite significant progress in understanding their three-dimensional structure, a critical gap remains in determining the molecular basis for channel gating. We recently identified mutations in the M2-M3 linkers that suggest linker flexibility has asymmetric subunit-specific correlations with channel opening. Here we use non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to investigate the role of main-chain H-hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) that may stabilize the M2-M3 linkers. We show that a single main-chain H-bond within the β2 subunit M2-M3 linker inhibits pore opening and is required to keep the unliganded channel closed. Furthermore, breaking this H-bond accounts for approximately one third of the energy used to open the channel during activation by GABA. In contrast, the analogous H-bond in the α1 subunit has no effect on gating. Our molecular simulations support the idea that channel opening involves the state-dependent breakage/disruption of a specific main-chain H-bond within the β2 subunit M2-M3 linker. The authors identify a single main-chain hydrogen bond required to keep GABAA receptors closed in the absence of neurotransmitter.

 Brainstem gliomas (BSG) is a highly malignant central nervous system childhood tumors with 5-year survival rate <10%.

Here we construct diagnostic and prognostic assays of BSG via circulating metabolites based on both cross-sectional study and longitudinal cohort study with 106 BSG patients. We employ nanoparticle enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to characterize static and dynamic snapshots of metabolites during BSG radiotherapy. We show that this serological tool reaches the area under the curve of 0.933 for BSG diagnosis in an independent blind test and predicts risk of patients with significant differences (p < 0.05) in prognostic outcomes. We further identify eight distinct temporal patterns of metabolite regulation associated with radiotherapy responses and tracked the metabolic trajectory via dynamic metabolic snapshots throughout radiotherapy process. If further validated, this framework could be extended to derive comprehensive metabolic pictures for cancers including but not limited to BSG.

 A key factor undermining the credibility of carbon offsets is the evaluation of project baselines and their impact. The ex ante scenarios constructed by project developers in accordance with rules set by certification schemes have been challenged by ex post evaluations from scientists, who frequently document cases of credit allocations that overestimate the actual emission reductions. Increasing credibility requires methodologies that reliably measure project outcomes and prevent overcrediting—an objective that ex post evaluations may be well suited to achieve. We explore how systematic ex post evaluations could restore credibility to certification schemes in the voluntary carbon market.

 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), as a major component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), significantly impacts air quality, climate, and human health. Although the aqueous chemistry of oxygenated organic compounds (OOCs) is acknowledged as an important contributor to the global SOA budget, the mechanisms by which this process yields SOA-forming oligomers remain unclear. Therefore, we clarify the aqueous-phase reactions of monocarbonyl OOCs (MOOCs, e.g., octanal and 2,4-hexadienal) in sulfuric acid aerosols using quantum chemistry and kinetic calculations. We identified all intermediates and products for established reaction pathways and explored a newly alcohol-governed mechanism for MOOC oligomerization, independent of prior atmospheric knowledge. Oligomers are yielded by the repetition of simple organic reactions, including protonation/deprotonation, hydration/dehydration, and nucleophilic addition, leading to rapid SOA formation. Our results unveil that an alcohol-governed aqueous-phase reaction mechanism of MOOC is likely prevalent across other OOCs in the atmosphere and helps to explain the explosive growth of PM2.5."

 Increasing protein demand in low- and middle-income countries may accelerate livestock intensification, antibiotic overuse and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risk. Here, we examined Uganda’s growing pig sector, tracking 70 farmers and their pigs in semi-intensive and free-range systems for a year. We investigated AMR and AMR gene abundance of 668 Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and DNA isolated from 877 faecal samples using diffusion disc-method and qPCR, respectively. Pigs in semi-intensive systems were 2.2 times more likely to exhibit AMR and had higher ermB levels. AMR in free-range farmers was twice that of pigs but still 1.4 times less likely than in semi-intensive systems. AMR prevalence increased by 0.76% per month. Potential transmission events were more likely on semi-intensive farms (OR = 3.16, 95% CI: 2.1–4.3, P < 0.001), especially when farmers had higher tetQ levels than pigs; the reverse was true for ermB.

 Oceanic arc and back-arc magmas are typically sourced from mantle metasomatized by subducted slab fluids/melts, but the role of the overriding plate is often ignored. Here we report the oxygen isotopic compositions of olivines in basalts erupted during arc, arc rifting, and back-arc spreading stages in the Mariana convergent margin. Rifting-stage olivines have high Forsterite (Fo = 85–90) and mantle-like δ18O (4.92 to 5.69‰). The δ18O values of olivines in arc and back-arc basin lavas correlate with their Fo values; high-Fo (>83) olivines have mantle-like δ18O while those in low-Fo olivines are as low as 3.87 ± 0.30‰. This indicates that fractionating magmas assimilated low-δ18O oceanic crust in the hydrothermally-altered upper plate, rather than the injections of underlying subducted slab-derived melts. Considering the globally widespread distribution of low-δ18O evolved olivine, we propose that low-δ18O wall rock may be common in the shallow lithosphere and serves as an important contributor to erupted evolved magma. Fractionated magma in volcanic arcs assimilate upper plate hydrothermal altered oceanic crust wall rock with low oxygen isotopic signature, which contribute to the isotopic signature of erupted magma, according to geochemical and oxygen isotope data of olivine in basalt formed at the Mariana convergent margin."

 Understanding crop migration to adapt to climate change is important to achieve food security and sustainable agriculture. Previous researches mainly focus on the impacts of climate change on crop yields and migration, but environmental feedback has been overlooked. Here we analyze the rice migration and its impact on water use in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China—which experienced considerable poleward expansion and climate warming. From 2000 to 2020, rice cultivation expanded northeast by 2.19 million hectares, increasing irrigation demand by 6.36 billion tonnes. Rice expansion contributed 122.18% to the abrupt irrigation increase, while the direct impact of climate change resulted in a −22.18% increase due to decreased evapotranspiration and increased precipitation. Such phenomenal rice expansion is considerably associated with the decline of groundwater levels by an average of 4.79 meters. Our findings highlight the urgent need to make integrated strategies balancing crop migration to climate change and water resource conservation. Rice expansion due to crop migration causes over 122% irrigation increases in Northeast China from 2000 to 2020, while climate change reduces irrigation demands by decreased evapotranspiration and increased precipitation, based on a water requirement model using rice maps and groundwater data."

 The Turkey-Syria earthquake, which struck in February 2023, was the worst earthquake the region had suffered in the last two decades. The post-earthquake reconstruction process remains underway, with local communities continuing to grapple with challenges. In this study, four cities in Turkey (i.e., Antakya, Kirikhan, Samandag, and Nurdagi) were investigated to track the post-disaster recovery process. We employed the power recovery percentage metric, derived from glimmer imagery acquired by the Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), which records nighttime light (NTL), to track the spatial-temporal dynamics of power restoration over the year following the earthquake. Clustering on time series NTL data was then utilized to identify pixel-scale recovery patterns. Furthermore, urban morphological variables were measured to explore their relationship with urban recovery at the block level. Our findings reveal three diverse dynamic patterns, characterized by ascending, descending, and stable NTL change trajectories. Notably, grids exhibiting rising NTL trends align closely with post-disaster reconstruction efforts (e.g., newly-built accommodation areas). In addition, blocks with low-density buildings, abundant open spaces, and uniform layouts demonstrate greater resilience and faster recovery pace. Overall, this study highlights that the SDGSAT-1 NTL data is powerful in capturing heterogeneous urban recovery processes following the disaster, thereby showing its contribution to advancing Sustainable Development Goal 11."

 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Understanding urban agglomerations, as highly developed products of urbanization, is important for achieving SDG 11. The Sustainable Development Science Satellite (SDGSAT-1), launched in 2021, aims to characterize “human activity traces” at a fine scale to fill data gaps and address incomplete methods in the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The satellite, with a 10 m glimmer imager, provides a new and valuable data source for research related to urban agglomerations. To better describe the degree of construction and development of urban agglomerations, we established two new indicators—the City Activity Index (CAI) and the Population Activity Index (PAI)—based on SDGSAT-1 glimmer imager data. Additionally, we proposed a novel method for extracting the strength of intercity connections using 10 m glimmer imager data to reflect the current status of city linkages. These methods were combined and applied in three urban agglomerations in China: Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The findings not only enhance our understanding of spatial patterns and resource flows within major Chinese urban agglomerations, but also provide actionable data support for urban planning, infrastructure development, and governance. The study fully demonstrates the advantages of SDGSAT-1 high-precision glimmer imager data in depicting urban development, and provides data support for achieving SDG 11."

 Urban functional zones (UFZ) are areas that divide urban space into specific uses based on the distribution of different human activities and infrastructure. UFZ mapping is to analyze the geographic information data of urban space, combine remote sensing images (RSI), point of interest (POI) data and other data sources, and use advanced spatial analysis technology to divide and visualize the UFZ. The intelligent interpretation of UFZ can provide support for urban management and planning. Previous studies on UFZ mainly focused on using remote sensing images and POI data, which can obtain the city’s macroscopic remote sensing visual features and the distribution of land use. However, these methods often ignore the inner-street details due to the absence of using inner-street perspective data and cannot capture the complex spatial relations between objects in complex urban scenes, resulting in unsatisfied UFZ results. For this purpose, we propose a unified multimodal learning method to interpret UFZ by combining remote sensing images, POI data, and street view data with inner-street details to provide a more comprehensive perspective to boost UFZ interpretation. To make full use of the inner-street perspective advantage of street view images (SVI), we not only use their visual features but also extract textual features that can reflect various human activities in street views through image captioning technology, better to capture the subtle socio-economic activity information in urban space. We conduct extensive experiments in Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanchang. The OA of this method on the test set reached 91.80%.

 Accurately inferring plant functional trait composition, diversity, and redundancy across space and time is pivotal for understanding environmental change impacts on forests’ biodiversity and functioning. Here, we tested the capabilities of combining in-situ and remote sensing approaches to deliver accurate estimates of functional trait composition, diversity, and redundancy of temperate forest vegetation in South America (30°S to 53°S) considering leaf and stem morphological, nutrient, hydraulic, and photosynthetic traits. We identified hydrological stress, soil properties, and topography as key drivers of plant functional trait distribution and variation. Further, hydrological stress and soil properties were key determinants of functional diversity and redundancy across a large latitudinal gradient. Functional diversity peaked across Mediterranean forests, occupying between 30°S to 35°S. Functional diversity and redundancy were both high at latitudes between 35°S and 42°S, coinciding with Valdivian rainforests. Conversely, functional redundancy peaked between 42°S and 48°S, corresponding to Austral forests. Towards the southernmost extent of the study area, functional diversity and redundancy were both low between 48°S and 53°S, corresponding to the Magellanic subpolar forests. Our results highlight areas in South American temperate forests where both plant functional diversity and redundancy were maximal, hence potentially pointing towards areas more resilient to environmental change."

 Ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions from aircraft engines are associated with increased UFP concentrations near airports, raising concerns for air quality and public health. This study investigated the impact of airport operations at Brussels Airport (Belgium) on local air quality during a two-month monitoring campaign in autumn 2015. Four monitoring sites, strategically located from the airport and along a transect parallel to the main runway, were used to measure particle number size distributions (PNSD), black carbon (BC), particulate matter (PM10), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). This novel approach, using high-resolution PNSD data, provided a detailed analysis of aircraft-related UFPs under varying meteorological conditions and operational phases. Results showed strong correlations between UFP concentrations, meteorological conditions, and aircraft landing and takeoff (LTO) operations, with the smallest measured particles (10–20 nm) dominating the particle number concentrations (PNC) near the airport, contributing up to 65 % of total PNC. Aircraft emissions were responsible for 15000–20000 # cm−3 of 10–20 nm particles near the airport, with peak concentrations (30-min) reaching 65000–80000 # cm−3 during high-activity periods. While airport-related UFP concentrations decreased with distance, they persisted up to 7 km. Source apportionment analysis identified taxiing and takeoff as major contributors to UFPs near the airport (50–64 % of PNC), with road traffic, biomass burning, and regional background more significant at greater distances. Despite attempts to distinguish between landing and takeoff emissions, similar particle profiles were observed for both operations. These findings provide insight into the spatial persistence, dominant operational phases, and size distribution of aircraft-related UFP emissions, and underscore the need for targeted mitigation strategies to improve air quality near airports."

 PM2.5 pollution is particularly severe in Xinjiang, China. However, the key influencing factors of heavy pollution events in this region remain unclear. In this study, we employ explainable machine learning to investigate the drivers of PM2.5 pollution from pre- to post-COVID-19 (February and March 2019-2021) in the Urumqi-Changji-Shihezi (UCS) region. Our results indicate that PM2.5 concentrations are 33% and 25% lower during the COVID-19 compared to pre- and post-COVID-19, respectively. Nevertheless, even during the COVID-19, PM2.5 pollution in the UCS region remain concerning, averaging 65.47 ± 67.37 μg/m3. Extreme PM2.5 pollution events (exceeding 150 μg/m3) are primarily attributed to unfavorable meteorological conditions. From 2019 to 2021, the meteorological factors exacerbating PM2.5 concentrations were recorded at 38.72 μg/m3 (42.5%), 21.31 μg/m3 (43.5%), and 34.04 μg/m3 (45%), respectively. Surface pressure (SP) and Ox (NO2 + O3) account for more than 70% of the variation in meteorological contributions. Over the period from 2019 to 2021, the contribution of meteorological conditions shifted from SP dominance to Ox dominance. Regarding emissions, CO contributes more significantly to the increase in PM2.5 levels compared to SO2, NO2, and O3, with a contribution of up to 79.43%. Furthermore, the greater the contribution of emissions, the more pronounced the impact of meteorological conditions on PM2.5 concentration. Therefore, regional emission standards may need to be adjusted based on varying levels of SP and Ox. Our findings underscore the necessity of considering the effects of SP and Ox on PM2.5 in the context of air pollution control in the UCS region."

These data, combined with petrogenetic constraints, indicate that serpentinization may have been driven by devolatilization of magmatic H2O, highlighting a potential link between H2production and the style and tempo of magmatism within the ancient martian crust."

What are the minimal conditions needed to achieve robust recognition abilities and when might these abilities develop? To answer these questions, we investigated the upper limits of children’s object recognition abilities. We found that children as young as 3 years successfully identified objects at speeds of 100 milliseconds (both forward and backward masked) under sparse and disrupted viewing conditions. By contrast, a range of computational models implemented with biologically informed properties or optimized for visual recognition did not reach child-level performance. Models only matched children if they received more object examples than children are capable of experiencing. These findings highlight the robustness of the human visual system in the absence of extensive experience and identify important developmental constraints for building biologically plausible machines."

The nearly identical stratigraphic trends, along with different absolute values in δ138Ba between the two sites, suggest spatial differences in marine biological pump intensity during the Early Mississippian.

It remains unclear how various hydrophobic environments stabilize membrane proteins and whether lipids play any unique role in protein stability compared to other types of amphiphiles.

Lipid solvation enhances protein stability by facilitating residue burial in the protein interior, reminiscent of the lipophobic effect. This lipid-mediated mechanism also strengthens the cooperative residue-interaction network, promoting the propagation of local structural perturbations throughout the protein.

Lerche,"Dynamic, multiphase magnetic resonance imaging of in vivo physiological processes with long-lived hyperpolarized 15N,d9-betaine","Hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (HypMRI) offers valuable insights into dynamic physiological processes in vivo. However, the short signal lifetime of hyperpolarized13C-labeled compounds commonly used in HypMRI studies restricts investigations to fast molecular reactions and rapid distributions. Here, we introduce hyperpolarized15N,d9-betaine (trimethyl-2H9-15N-glycine) as an endogenous MRI contrast agent with a long-lived signal suited for comprehensive molecular tracking. With in vivo detectability exceeding 14 minutes and high polarization efficiency,15N,d9-betaine supports both real-time and delayed-phase MRI from a single dose, enabling flexible, multistage imaging. In preclinical models, renal15N,d9-betaine images were acquired with strong signal-to-noise ratios across resolutions. This extended imaging window facilitates tracking molecular distribution, assessing tissue perfusion, and monitoring cellular uptake relevant to betaine’s roles in cellular protection. By extending MRI capabilities across timescales, hyperpolarized15N,d9-betaine holds promise for applications like organ function assessment, disease monitoring, and real-time evaluation of therapeutic interventions, advancing noninvasive molecular imaging."

Numerous gatekeepers determine which research manuscripts complete this dissemination pathway, and the resulting media landscape influences public understandings of scientific fields. Here, we compare scientific and popular publishing of archaeology about different geographic regions. Of 1155 archaeology papers in one specialist and six general science journals across 6 years, 32% were reported by at least one of 15 US news sources. Mixed-effects logistic regression models revealed variation across news sources, but overall papers about archaeology in United Kingdom, Israel/Palestine, and Australia were significantly more likely to receive coverage, compared to China/Taiwan. This disparity raises concerns as archaeology influences notions of identity and cultural achievement, and has been misappropriated by racist, nationalist ideologies. We recommend ways for actors in research dissemination to diversify archaeology coverage."

In this study, we introduce nanosilicates as proangiogenic biomaterials that can prime endogenous cells to expedite angiogenesis and graft vascularization in vivo. Characterized by their mineral-based two-dimensional structure and extensive surface area, nanosilicates are efficiently internalized by endothelial cells, leading to augmented cellular migration and the formation of tubular structures. Through whole transcriptome sequencing, we elucidated that nanosilicates activate the canonical Wnt pathway through hypoxia-induced ROS production. In vivo investigations further corroborate the proangiogenic efficacy of nanosilicate-loaded biomaterials. This study posits nanosilicates as a potential proangiogenic adjunct in the design of biomaterials for in situ tissue regeneration."

Cai,Simultaneous two-color imaging with a dual-channel miniscope in freely behaving mice,"Miniaturized fluorescence microscopes (miniscopes) enable imaging of calcium events from a large population of neurons in freely behaving animals. Traditionally, miniscopes have only been able to record from a single fluorescence wavelength. Here, we present an open-source dual-channel miniscope that simultaneously records two wavelengths in freely behaving animals. To enable simultaneous acquisition of two fluorescent wavelengths, we incorporated two CMOS sensors into a single miniscope. To validate our dual-channel miniscope, we imaged hippocampal CA1 region that co-expressed a dynamic calcium indicator (GCaMP) and a static nuclear signal (dTomato) while mice ran on a linear track. Our results suggest that, even when neurons were registered across days using dTomato signals, hippocampal spatial coding changes over time. In conclusion, our dual-channel miniscope enables imaging of two fluorescence wavelengths with minimal cross-talk between the two channels, opening the doors to a multitude of previously inaccessible experimental possibilities."

Herein, magnesium microspheres (Mg MSs) were used as embolic devices to enhance lipiodol-mediated TACE. After being dispersed in lipiodol and injected into tumors, Mg MSs would continuously generate hydrogen and magnesium hydroxide, which could neutralize the acidic tumor microenvironment, restore exhausted CD8+T cells, reverse immunosuppression, and trigger specific T cell–mediated antitumor responses, synergistically resulting in inhibited tumor growth. As demonstrated in a rabbit orthotopic liver cancer model, artery infusion of Mg MS–dispersed lipiodol offered greatly enhanced therapeutic outcome compared to lipiodol-based or polymeric-bead–based TACE. In a pilot clinical study, among 15 eligible patients with HCC, 11 patients achieved complete response and 3 patients achieved partial responses without unexpected treatment-related adverse events during the 1 to 3 months’ follow-up. The objective response rate of Mg-enhanced TACE was ~93.3% in this small-scale trial, much higher than that of current TACE therapies."

Overvelde,Toward developing a compact total artificial heart using a soft robotic fluidic transmission system,"Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality, with limited possibilities for transplantation due to a critical shortage of donor hearts. Replacing the heart with total artificial hearts (TAHs) remains challenging, due to size constraints and energy requirements, among others. To address this, we introduce the LIMO heart, a compact TAH concept based on an efficient soft fluidic transmission system. By reducing actuator volume and enhancing energy transfer, LIMO enables a more compact and efficient design. We developed a soft ventricle prototype using thin-walled pouch actuators that achieve transmission ratios above one via circumferential shrinkage. A fast, cost-effective prototyping method accelerated testing. Experimental results showed high energy transfer efficiency (82 to 91%), and in vitro tests demonstrated promising cardiac outputs of 5.9 liters per minute against aortic pressure and 7.6 liters per minute against pulmonary pressure. These findings represent a step toward a more broadly applicable biventricular soft robotic TAH for treating end-stage heart failure."

These models come with clear limitations, can produce inaccurate information, and reinforce existing biases. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how widespread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this question for the field of biomedical research, we present an unbiased, large-scale approach: We study vocabulary changes in more than 15 million biomedical abstracts from 2010 to 2024 indexed by PubMed and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This excess word analysis suggests that at least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, reaching 40% for some subcorpora. We show that LLMs have had an unprecedented impact on scientific writing in biomedical research, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the COVID pandemic."

Meanwhile, quantum coherence is a crucial resource for quantum information processing. However, despite extensive studies on various aspects of quantum metrology, the interplay between the dynamics of the QFI and quantum coherence remains unexplored. Here, we explore the factorization relationship between the QFI and quantum coherence, both theoretically and experimentally. We prepare pure states in qubit and qutrit systems and apply unitary evolution to investigate this relationship. Our results confirm the factorization law, offering strong evidence for this relationship. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound on the variance of the estimated parameter that does not require the final state information. This approach reveals a deep connection between the QFI and quantum coherence, providing insights into quantum parameter estimation. These findings have potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum metrology."
