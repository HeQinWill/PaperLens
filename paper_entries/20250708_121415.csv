10.5194/acp-25-6757-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注大气甲烷（CH4）的排放问题，特别是2020-2022年间大气甲烷浓度异常增长的原因。论文利用多种观测数据（包括地表观测、飞机观测和GOSAT卫星观测）和逆向建模方法，估算了不同地区和行业对甲烷排放的贡献。研究结果表明，南亚和东南亚的生物源排放对大气甲烷的增长有显著影响。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是大气成分分析和利用卫星观测进行气体排放估算。,"['atmospheric methane', 'CH4 emissions', 'inverse modeling', 'surface observations', 'aircraft observations', 'GOSAT observations', 'biogenic emissions', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Yosuke Niwa;Yasunori Tohjima;Yukio Terao;Tazu Saeki;Akihiko Ito;Taku Umezawa;Kyohei Yamada;Motoki Sasakawa;Toshinobu Machida;Shin-Ichiro Nakaoka;Hideki Nara;Hiroshi Tanimoto;Hitoshi Mukai;Yukio Yoshida;Shinji Morimoto;Shinya Takatsuji;Kazuhiro Tsuboi;Yousuke Sawa;Hidekazu Matsueda;Kentaro Ishijima;Ryo Fujita;Daisuke Goto;Xin Lan;Kenneth Schuldt;Michal Heliasz;Tobias Biermann;Lukasz Chmura;Jarsolaw Necki;Irène Xueref-Remy;Damiano Sferlazzo,Multi-observational estimation of regional and sectoral emission contributions to the persistent high growth rate of atmospheric CH4 for 2020–2022,"This study estimated regional and sectoral emission contributions to the unprecedented surge of atmospheric methane for 2020–2022. The methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and its emissions reduction is urgently required to mitigate global warming. Numerical modeling-based estimates with three different sets of atmospheric observations consistently suggested large contributions of biogenic emissions from South Asia and Southeast Asia to the surge of atmospheric methane. 
 Atmospheric methane (CH4) growth rates reached unprecedented values in the years 2020–2022. To identify the main drivers of this increase, an inverse modeling study estimated regional and sectoral emission changes for 2016–2022. Three inverse estimates based on different sets of atmospheric CH4 observations (surface observations only, surface and aircraft observations, and GOSAT observations) consistently suggest notable emission increases from 2016–2019 to 2020–2022 in the tropics (15° S–10° N) (10–18 Tg CH4 yr−1) and in northern low latitudes (10–35° N) (ca. 20 Tg CH4 yr−1), the latter of which likely contributed to the growth rate surge from 2020. The emission increase in the northern low latitudes is attributed to emissions in South Asia and northern Southeast Asia, which abruptly increased from 2019 to 2020, and elevated emissions continued until 2022. Meanwhile, the tropical emission increase is dominated by Tropical South America and Central Africa, but emissions were continuously increasing before 2019. Agreement was found in the sectoral estimates of the three inversions in the tropics and northern low latitudes, suggesting the largest contribution of biogenic emissions. Uncertainty reductions demonstrate that the flux estimates in Asia are well constrained by surface and aircraft observations. Furthermore, a sensitivity test with the probable reduction of OH radicals showed smaller emissions by up to 2–3 Tg CH4 yr−1 in each Asian region for 2020, still suggesting notable emission contributions. These results highlight the importance of biogenic emissions in Asian regions for the persistent high growth rate observed during 2020–2022."

Crawford;Katherine R. Travis;Laura M. Judd;Mary Angelique G. Demetillo;Lukas C. Valin;James J. Szykman;Andrew Whitehill;Eric Baumann;Thomas F. Hanisco,Maximizing the scientific application of Pandora column observations of HCHO and NO2,"The Pandonia Global Network (PGN) consists of Pandora spectrometers that observe trace gases at a high time resolution to validate satellite observations and understand local air quality. To aid users, PGN assigns quality flags that assure scientifically valid data but eliminate large amounts of data appropriate for scientific applications. A new method based on contemporaneous data in two independent observation modes is proven using complementary ground-based and airborne observations. 
 As part of the Pandonia Global Network (PGN), Pandora spectrometers are widely deployed around the world. These ground-based remote-sensing instruments are federated such that they employ a common algorithm and data protocol for reporting on trace gas column densities and lower-atmospheric profiles using two modes based on direct-sun and sky-scan observations. To aid users in the analysis of Pandora observations, the PGN standard quality flagging procedure assigns flags to the data indicating high, medium, and low quality. This work assesses the suitability of these data quality flags for filtering data in the scientific analysis of formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), two critical precursors controlling tropospheric ozone production. Pandora data flagged as high quality assure scientifically valid data and are often more abundant for direct-sun NO2 columns. For direct-sun HCHO and for sky-scan observations of both molecules, large amounts of data flagged as low quality also appear to be valid. Upon closer inspection of the data, independent uncertainty is shown to be a better indicator of data quality than the standard quality flags. After applying a filter to independent uncertainty, Pandora data flagged as medium or low quality in both modes can be demonstrated to be scientifically useful. The utility of this filtering method is demonstrated by correlating contemporaneous but independent direct-sun and sky-scan observations. When evaluated across 15 Pandora sites in North America, this new filtering method can recover as much as 90 % of data that would have previously been discarded. This method suggests that standard PGN criteria for atmospheric variability and the normalized root mean squared error are too stringent, as they are responsible for downgrading most of the recovered data. A method is also developed for combining the direct-sun and sky-scan observations into a single dataset by accounting for biases between the two observing modes and differences in measurement integration times. These combined data provide a more continuous record that is useful for interpreting Pandora observations against other independent variables such as hourly observations of surface ozone. When Pandora HCHO columns are correlated with surface ozone measurements, data filtered by independent uncertainty exhibit similarly strong and more robust relationships than high-quality data alone. These results suggest that Pandora data users should carefully assess data across all quality flags and consider their potential for useful application to scientific analysis. The present study provides a method for maximizing use of Pandora data with the expectation of more robust satellite validation and comparisons with ground-based observations in support of air quality studies."

 We assess and illustrate the benefits of high-altitude attainment of balloon-borne radiosonde soundings, up to and beyond 10 hPa level compared to, for example, 30 hPa, at operational stations and at sites of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Reference Upper Air Network (GRUAN). We first discuss technical challenges and the possible solutions for balloon soundings at these higher altitudes. Then, we assess the role of high-ascent radiosonde measurements in climate monitoring and various process studies, contributions to satellite calibration and validation, and impacts on numerical weather prediction systems. The analysis herein shows that the extra costs and technical challenges involved in consistent attainment of high ascents are more than outweighed by the benefits for a broad variety of real-time and delayed-mode applications.

Davison;Anna E. Hogg;Thomas Slater;Richard Rigby;Nicolaj Hansen,Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line discharge  from 1996–2024,"Grounding line discharge is a measure of the amount of ice entering the ocean from an ice mass. This paper describes a dataset of grounding line discharge for the Antarctic Ice Sheet and each of its glaciers. The dataset shows that Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line discharge has increased since 1996. 
 Grounding line discharge is a key component of the mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we present a time-varying estimate of Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line discharge, at up to monthly intervals, from 1996 through to November 2024. We calculate ice flux through 16 algorithmically generated flux gates across 998 ice sheet, glacier, ice stream and ice shelf drainage basins. We draw on a range of ice velocity and thickness data to estimate grounding line discharge. For ice thickness, we use three bed topography datasets, two firn models and a time-varying ice surface. For the ice velocity, we utilise a range of publicly available ice velocity maps at resolutions ranging from 200 m×200 m to 1000 m×1000 m, as well as new 100 m×100 m monthly velocity mosaics derived from intensity tracking of Sentinel-1 image pairs, available since October 2014.  Our dataset also includes the contributions to discharge from changes in ice thickness due to surface lowering, time-varying firn air content, and surface mass change between the flux gates and grounding line. We find that Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line discharge increased from 1999±175 to 2224±200Gtyr-1 between 1996 and 2024, much of which was due to the acceleration of ice streams in West Antarctica but with substantial contributions from ice streams in East Antarctica and glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. The errors in our discharge dataset stem approximately equally from errors in the underlying ice velocity and thickness measurements. However, we find that the spread in possible discharge estimates depending on the choice of bed topography dataset and flux gate location is much larger than the error in any single estimate. It is our intention to update this discharge dataset each month, subject to continued Sentinel-1 acquisitions and funding availability. The dataset is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10051893 (this paper was prepared using version 7 of the dataset) (Davison et al., 2024)."

The primary goal of the mission was to collect data within cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies during Austral Winter along the Polar Front. Unfortunate issues with the vehicles led to observations being collected in the spring and summer months and north of the Polar Front. Twelve eddies were sampled, but no meaningful relationship between pCO2 anomalies and eddies was found. 
 During the second half of 2022 and the first several months on 2023, a pair of Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) collected high-resolution (~5-km sampling) measurements of ocean and atmosphere pCO2, air temperature and humidity, wind, ocean skin temperature, sea surface temperature, salinity, ocean color (Chlorophyll α), dissolved oxygen, and ocean current velocity between roughly 13.5° E and 82° E and between the Subtropical Front (STF) and the Subantarctic Front (SAF). The mission track spanned from the Agulhas Return Current south of South Africa to the northern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current downstream of the Kerguelen Plateau. The primary goal of the mission was to collect data within cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies to quantify CO2 fluxes to better understand physical processes (upwelling and downwelling) that that can contribute to carbon cycling in addition to the biological pump. In this paper, we present an overview of the mission, details on the data collected, and a preliminary look at calculated surface pCO2, separated into cyclonic/anti-cyclonic/no-eddy conditions."

Results from three southwest-type heavy rainfall cases in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region suggest the added forecast skill of ridge and foothill networks associated with the Taihang Mountains over the existing RWP network. This research provides valuable guidance for designing optimal RWP networks in the region. 
 The optimal spatial layout of a radar wind profiler (RWP) network for rainfall forecasting, especially over complex terrain, remains uncertain. This study explores the benefits of assimilating vertical wind measurements from various RWP network layouts into convective-scale numerical weather prediction (NWP) through Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). Synthetic RWP data were assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using the National Severe Storms Laboratory three-dimensional variational data assimilation (DA) system for three southwest (SW)-type heavy rainfall events in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. Four types of DA experiments were conducted and compared: a control experiment (CTL) that assimilates data solely from the operational RWP network and three additional experiments incorporating foothill (FH), ridge (RD), and combined foothill–ridge (FH_RD) RWP network layouts. A detailed examination of the 21 July 2023 case reveals that the FH_RD experiment generally exhibits more skillful storm forecasts in terms of areal coverage, storm mode, and orientation, benefiting from refined mesoscale wind analysis. Particularly, in the RD experiment, RWP data assimilation notably reduces wind errors and improves the representation of mesoscale atmospheric features near the Taihang Mountains upstream of Beijing, crucial for convective initiation (CI). Aggregated score metrics across all cases also indicate that both FH and RD experiments offer substantial added value over the operational network alone. Further sensitivity experiments on vertical resolution and maximum detection height indicate that the RWP system configuration with the highest detection height achieves the best performance, while lower detection height degrades forecast quality. These findings highlight the importance of strategic RWP network placement along the Taihang Mountains' ridge and foothill for short-term quantitative precipitation forecast in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region."

Despite their importance, a mechanistic and quantitative understanding of these processes under dynamic flow conditions remains elusive, particularly at the basin scale. In this study, we investigate the multiscale (site-to-basin) mechanisms governing methane emissions from riverbeds, focusing on the interplay between biogeochemical processes and hydrological dynamics. We developed a reactive transport model that integrates methane production with hydrodynamic and ebullitive pathways and coupled it with a basin-scale groundwater flow model to simulate methane emissions across scales. By incorporating key factors such as vertical hydrological exchange flow (VHEF), particulate organic carbon availability, sediment properties, and temperature sensitivity, our model captures the spatiotemporal variability of methane ebullition at both the site and basin scales. Our results reveal that methane ebullition is strongly modulated by VHEF, with lower flow rates promoting methane accumulation and subsequent ebullition. Sensitivity analyses underscore nonlinear responses of methane fluxes to environmental drivers. These findings emphasize the critical roles of sediment composition, hydrological exchange, and environmental conditions in shaping methane dynamics. Overall, this work advances our understanding of riverine methane emissions and offers insights for guiding climate models and mitigation strategies."

A major competitor binding to metal (hydr)oxides is natural organic matter (NOM). This study investigated the competitive binding between humic acids (HA) and PMG on goethite with batch adsorption experiments, varying pH, ionic strength, and HA surface loading. HA strongly decreases PMG adsorption, increasing its solution concentration by multiple orders of magnitude. Interpretation of the competitive adsorption data with the NOM-CD model revealed that site and electrostatic competition insufficiently explain the competition. The model can be greatly improved by introducing steric hindrance as an additional mechanism, requiring only a single adjustable parameter. At low pH, HA maximizes its interaction with the surface while at high pH, the ligands tend to move outward. Our model reveals that steric hindrance is most significant in acidic conditions, while in alkaline conditions, competition is primarily controlled by electrostatics. The steric NOM-CD model provides excellent predictions of the behavior of PMG competing with HA and provides a tool to describe the key role of NOM in assessing the availability, mobility, and risk of PMG in the environment."

However, information regarding the metabolic interactions and associated mechanisms during bioremediation remains scarce. This study used a bottom-up approach to illustrate how mutually beneficial cross-feeding relationships form and influence the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants. The synthetic bacterial consortium is comprised of a competent bacterial degrader, Rhodococcus sp. strain p52, and a nondegrader, Acinetobacter sp. BD6 that facilitates dibenzo-p-dioxin degradation. Strain p52 releases metabolic intermediates, such as catechol, during dibenzo-p-dioxin degradation, supporting the growth of strain BD6. Not only is strain BD6 able to compete with strain p52 for cytotoxic catechol consumption, but it is also able to secrete types of siderophores for increasing iron bioavailability that were beneficial to strain p52. The microbial consortium regulates the transcriptional activities of genes involved in dibenzo-p-dioxin catabolism and siderophore synthesis and transport in strains p52 and BD6, conferring a survival advantage. Thus, based on an externalized metabolic intermediate and shared siderophores, a mutualistic metabolic cross-feeding relationship is established between strains p52 and BD6. This study provides insights into the specific mechanisms underlying microbial mutualistic metabolic cross-feeding and the role of siderophores in microbial interactions."

However, the temporal relationships between these constituents remain unclear, as most field studies have relied on single-time snapshots and seldom examined the interplay between chemical and biological dynamics. We conducted a month-long spatiotemporal field study across 20 households in Hong Kong to investigate the factors influencing chemical and biological constituents on common indoor surfaces. Among the 16 household- and occupant-related factors analyzed, routine oil-based cooking was the primary driver of microbial diversity and composition on indoor surfaces. Surfaces in kitchens with frequent cooking exhibited elevated total organic carbon levels, which were linked to an increased bacterial abundance. A focused analysis of six kitchens with well-controlled frequencies of oil-based cooking revealed that cooking-derived organic compounds, particularly alkanes, promoted bacterial abundance while reducing microbial diversity. Network analysis further revealed strong interactions between these organic compounds and bacterial taxa, especially those within the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla. These findings highlight the impact of routine household activities on indoor chemical–biological interactions, enhancing our understanding and informing strategies to improve indoor environments and occupant well-being."

Although the neurotoxicity of TPHP to aquatic animals had been highlighted in previous studies, its effects on mammals, particularly at environmentally relevant doses (ERDs), have remained largely unknown. In this study, a 28-week mouse model was established to investigate the potential neurotoxicity induced by ERDs of TPHP (0.89 and 9.19 μg/kg/day). The mechanisms underlying gut–brain axis communication were explored using behavioral tests, 16S rRNA sequencing, and multiomics analysis. The results demonstrated that chronic exposure to an ERD of TPHP (9.19 μg/kg/day) significantly reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota of mice and led to an increase in pro-inflammatory bacterium. These alterations activated the NF-κB signaling pathway in the prefrontal cortex, resulting in the accumulation of quinolinic acid and glutamate. Ultimately, these changes induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice. This study provides novel insights into the indirect neurotoxic effects of TPHP exposure at ERDs in mammals and emphasizes the need for more stringent regulatory policies regarding the use of TPHP."

In this study, we investigated the aerosol hygroscopicity of ammonium sulfate (AS) and 2-methylglutaric acid (2-MGA) mixtures. 2-MGA is a moderately surface-active compound. Dilute surface tension measurements of 2-MGA/AS mixtures were taken by using a pendant drop goniometer. Hygroscopicity at subsaturated conditions was determined using a hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (H-TDMA) and relative humidity was kept constant at 89 ± 0.9% RH. The droplet activation was also measured at supersaturated conditions using a cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC) from 0.4 to 1% supersaturation (SS). The single-hygroscopicity parameter κ was derived from measurements. Mixtures predominantly composed of AS, up to a 60 wt% 2-MGA, exhibit κ-values close to pure AS. However, κ decreases significantly as the organic fraction increases (>60 wt% 2-MGA). Previous predictions of κ-hygroscopicity assume full dissolution of both the organic and inorganic compounds. However, organic partitioning can influence the κ-hygroscopicity. A coverage-based parametrization, ϕ, assumes the probability of surface-active organics at the droplet surface. By estimation of the bulk and surface organic contribution, overall κ-hygroscopicity can be calculated. The model is computationally efficient, and the results indicate that organic solute depletion should be considered for fully soluble surface-active organics. Hygroscopicity predictions that account for the role of organic surface-active partitioning agree best with experimental results (R2 > 0.95). Therefore, this study helps to enhance our understanding of cloud-forming properties of complex chemical mixtures containing surface-active organic and inorganic compounds."

These ions modulate the dust’s radiative properties and its contribution to the deposition of bioavailable nutrients, thereby shaping regional and global climate processes as well as marine ecosystem dynamics. This review synthesizes current research on the variations of major WSIs in dust particles transported from desert regions to downstream marine areas over East Asia. In source regions and adjacent areas, WSIs typically account for 4% to 14% of dust mass, dominated by mineral salts including SO42–, Cl–, Na+, and Ca2+. As dust moves into the populated areas of northern China, the WSIs is still dominated by mineral sources, while substantial secondary SO42–, NO3– and NH4+ can be observed particularly in reversely transported dust plumes. In the coastal areas of eastern China, similar trends are observed, with additional sea salt contributions under marine air influence. When dust plumes reach Korea and Japan, dust particles often have higher proportions of SO42– and NO3–, mixed with sea salt, with WSIs in fine particles sometimes exceeding 30% of the mass. These changes of WSIs in Asian dust particles during their long-distance transport highlight the dynamic physicochemical properties of dust aerosols, their climatic and environmental effects, as well as the accompanying health risks. The review concludes with a discussion of key research challenges in quantifying WSIs in long-distance transporting Asian dust and understanding their implications."

Hughes,Influence of Biomass Burning on Fluorescent Aerosol Particles in Subarctic Winter Conditions,"Fluorescent aerosol particles (FAPs) are airborne particles that emit fluorescence when exposed to specific wavelengths of light, typically ultraviolet or visible light. In recent times, real-time measurements of aerosol autofluorescence have been widely used to study primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) or bioaerosol. Although autofluorescence techniques provide improved temporal resolution for PBAP detection, interference from nonbiological fluorescent particles complicates measurements, particularly in polluted environments. This study investigates the fluorescence properties of airborne particles influenced by biomass burning. Real-time measurements of FAPs were conducted in the North Pole, Alaska, using a wideband integrated bioaerosol sensor. Concurrent filter measurements and data from other real-time instruments were used to analyze FAP composition and size to assess the influence of biomass burning. Results indicate a moderate correlation between biomass burning and specific FAP types below 0.75 μm, evidenced by their association with levoglucosan, a biomass burning tracer. Findings further demonstrate that biomass burning emissions increased FAP concentrations, resulting in statistically significant shifts in particle size and fluorescence intensity. Notably, biomass burning appears to drive increases in specific PBAP concentrations, including potential bacterial and fungal spores, raising concerns over health impacts for local populations exposed to both anthropogenic pollutants and elevated PBAP levels. These findings provide valuable data on PBAPs in subarctic winter conditions, underscoring the environmental and public health implications of biomass burning in cold climates."

Environmental carcinogens induce mutations leading to tumors; pathogens relying on environmental media transmission cause infections; exposure to chemical or biological pollutants triggers toxicant poisoning. The mechanisms of xenobiotics work by abnormal expression of genes. Since their inception, genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout libraries have been rapidly applied in vitro to dissect the mechanism of diseases. Genome-wide screening of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout libraries has helped to identify genes essential for tumor survival, combinations of genes for synthetic lethal effects, and genes associated with drug resistance or susceptibility. In addition, key host factors and complex toxicological mechanisms of viral infection have been elucidated, contributing to the development of antidotes and the reduction of the incidence of adverse effects. CRISPR/Cas9 library screening can be combined with single-cell sequencing and organoid technologies to identify novel gene interactions and more reliable preclinical data.

Due to the relative abundance and complexity of overlying snow on sea ice, radar altimetry methods routinely deployed for sea ice thickness estimation in the Arctic are difficult to apply in Antarctica. We present nadir‐looking radar waveforms from the first deployment of the KuKa surface‐based radar on Antarctic sea ice, specifically multi‐year sea ice in the Weddell Sea marginal ice zone with a thick snow cover. Coincident snow pits revealed thick layers of snow which were exposed to the summer melt season and superimposed ice. Our instrument detects only very small amount of co‐polarized radar backscatter from the sea ice surface, suggesting that conventional satellite altimeters may not always range to this interface.

Both groups exhibit pronounced 8–20‐day variability, particularly in EATOFs, whereas SEATOFs demonstrate an additional 20–60‐day peak. The corresponding 8–20‐day atmospheric ISVs are focused on, which closely mirror the tropical quasi‐biweekly oscillation (QBWO) but differ in spatial structure. SEATOFs are tied to a zonally elongated, westward‐propagating QBWO (W‐QBWO), while EATOFs are linked to a west‐northward‐propagating QBWO (NW‐QBWO) with a slight southwest‐northeast tilt and intensified perturbations along the East Asian coast. Notably, EATOFs and their 8–20‐day ISV amplitude have concurrently increased since the late 1990s. This shift can be attributed to an interdecadal shift of QBWO dominance from W‐QBWO to NW‐QBWO.

The relationship between late‐season WNP TC frequency and the PMM index has increased in recent decades. During 1951–1990, TC genesis is enhanced (suppressed) over the eastern (western) WNP during a positive PMM, due to the PMM's signal only extending from the subtropical northeastern Pacific to the eastern WNP. By contrast, during 1991–2023, a positive PMM leads to a basinwide enhancement of WNP TC genesis, due to PMM‐induced TC‐favorable environmental conditions expanding to the full WNP. This intensified PMM‐TC relationship is likely due to increased Intertropical Convergence Zone precipitation over the tropical eastern Pacific, which enhances northeasterly trade winds over the subtropical Pacific and subsequently strengthens the PMM."

Pronounced upward nutrient fluxes were observed within the deep chlorophyll maximum layer due to ITE‐induced mixing. Lateral transport directly influenced nutrient concentrations through isopycnal advection and indirectly by regulating the horizontal distribution of sinking particles. The latter likely induced spatial variability in mineralization, which played a dominant role in shaping nutrient enrichment.

Increased Asian AAs induce a tri‐polar anomaly pattern in Antarctica via a poleward propagating Rossby wave train. This pattern is characterized by warmer temperature and less sea ice in the Amundsen‐Bellingshausen Seas, and cooler temperature and more sea ice in regions on its both flanks.

Our simulations show that mantle plume impact can effectively destabilize and delaminate cold, mature continental lithosphere. However, for the plume head to penetrate the lithosphere and initiate removal of the lower lithospheric mantle, a deep‐seated zone of weakness beneath the MLD is required. This vertically oriented zone could be an inherited tectonic suture and/or a domain of pervasive percolation of plume‐derived melts and/or fluids. In the context explored here, where a long‐lived plume is continuously fed from below, the conditions for plume‐induced craton destabilization appear to be less stringent than earlier assumed, as it can occur even with a thin MLD (≤10 km) and a purely hydrous plume lacking an initial thermal component."

We propose to account for urban heterogeneities by applying multi‐layer division and the drag‐force approach jointly to urban canopies. The impact of urban heterogeneities is represented by vertical profiles of roughness density to form a physics‐based aerodynamic parameterization for real urban surfaces (denoted RUR). Evaluation over real urban surfaces shows that RUR generally outperforms the classical schemes, especially for the estimate of z0 ${z}_{0}$.

Covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, the ocean remains an underutilized resource for climate mitigation. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is one such strategy, designed to strengthen the ocean's natural carbon sink, reduce atmospheric CO2, and mitigate ocean acidification. However, its implications for fisheries, critical for food security and livelihoods, remain uncertain. This study examines the interplay between global fisheries, OAE, and different future socioeconomic and climatic conditions, using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways framework. We explore how global fisheries and OAE could evolve under three combined scenarios: SSP1‐2.6 (sustainability‐focused), SSP3‐7.0 (regional rivalry), and SSP5‐8.5 (high fossil fuel dependency). By integrating ecological, economic, societal, and technological perspectives, we develop scenario narratives and quantify key bio‐economic parameters, including technological progress, fishing costs, fisheries management, marine aquaculture, and ecosystem carrying capacity. High‐emission (SSP5‐8.5) and fragmented development (SSP3‐7.0) scenarios present significant barriers to the coexistence of OAE and fisheries, whereas sustainability‐focused pathways (SSP1‐2.6) offer the most favorable conditions for their alignment. Successfully integrating OAE with fisheries management will likely depend on technological advancements, international cooperation, and socio‐economic developments.

To address these challenges, the Coupling Coordination Degree framework is employed to analyze the relationship between human activities and the environment. An adjusted ecosystem services (ES) matrix is used to calculate the supply, demand, and balance of potential ES and develops a human activity intensity index (HAII) that considers multiple factors, such as nighttime light and grazing intensity. By analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution of ES supply, demand, balance, HAII, and coordination degree from 2000 to 2020, this research provides insights into the evolution of coordinated human‐environmental development. Results indicate ES supply increased, but ES balance first improved and then declined. Meanwhile, HAII increased continuously, a bivariate local Moran's I test (−0.23) reveals a significant trade‐off between ES balance and HAII. Coupling Coordination analysis shows that over 86% of the region has a coordination degree below 0.7, indicating Barely Balanced Development. The most significant drop occurred in Tianjin, suggesting that intensified human activities may have contributed to the declining ES balance. Forests and grasslands account for over 88% of the cumulative contribution to ES balance. Scientific restoration of grasslands and maintenance of forest ecosystems are crucial for sustaining the human‐environment system in the JJJM region.

 Heatwaves are expected to both increase in frequency and duration under global warming. The probability distributions of heatwave durations are shaped by day-to-day correlations in temperature and so cannot be simply inferred from changes in the probabilities of daily temperature extremes. Here we show from statistical analysis of global historical and projected temperature data that changes in long-duration heatwaves increase nonlinearly with temperature. Specifically, from analysis informed by theory for autocorrelated fluctuations applied to European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) reanalysis and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate model simulations, we find that the nonlinearity results in acceleration of the rate increase with warming; that is, each increment of regional time-averaged warming increases the characteristic duration scale of long heatwaves more than the previous increment. We show that the curve for this acceleration can be approximately collapsed onto a single dependence across regions by normalizing by local temperature variability. Projections of future change can thus be compared to observations of recent change over part of their range, which supports the near-future-projected acceleration. We also find that the longest, most uncommon heatwaves for a given region have the greatest increase in likelihood, yielding a compounding source of nonlinear impacts.

 JAK (Janus Kinase) inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, were introduced a decade ago for treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). To evaluate ruxolitinib’s impact on MPN clonal evolution, we interrogate a myelofibrosis patient cohort with longitudinal molecular evaluation and discover that ruxolitinib is associated with clonal outgrowth of RAS pathway mutations. Single-cell DNA sequencing combined with ex vivo treatment of RAS mutated CD34+ primary patient cells, demonstrates that ruxolitinib induces RAS clonal selection both in a JAK/STAT wild-type and hyper-activated context. RAS mutations are associated with decreased transformation-free and overall survival only in patients treated with ruxolitinib. In vitro and in vivo competition assays demonstrate increased cellular fitness of RAS-mutated cells under ruxolitinib or JAK2 knock-down, consistent with an on-target effect. MAPK pathway activation is associated with JAK2 downregulation resulting in enhanced oncogenic potential of RAS mutations. Our results prompt screening for pre-existing RAS mutations in JAK inhibitor treated patients with MPN.

Here, the authors report an unsupervised learning approach to detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants from rural and urban wastewater showing it achieves earlier detection than existing methods and detects new variants without clinical testing data. 
 Genome sequencing from wastewater enables accurate and cost-effective identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, existing computational pipelines have limitations in detecting emerging variants not yet characterized in humans. Here, we present an unsupervised learning approach that clusters co-varying and time-evolving mutation patterns to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. To build our model, we sequence 3659 wastewater samples collected over two years from urban and rural locations in Southern Nevada. We then develop a multivariate independent component analysis (ICA)-based pipeline to transform mutation frequencies into independent sources. These data-driven time-evolving and co-varying sources are compared to 8810 SARS-CoV-2 clinical genomes from Nevadans. Our method accurately detects the Delta variant in late 2021, Omicron variants in 2022, and emerging recombinant XBB variants in 2023. Our approach also reveals the spatial and temporal dynamics of variants in both urban and rural regions; achieves earlier detection of most variants compared to other computational tools; and uncovers unique co-varying mutation patterns not associated with any known variant. The multivariate nature of our pipeline boosts statistical power and supports accurate early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This feature offers a unique opportunity to detect emerging variants and pathogens, even in the absence of clinical testing. Wastewater surveillance can help in pandemic or outbreak response.

 The molecular mechanisms underlying the transport of influenza A virus (IAV) membrane proteins to the cell surface remain largely unclear. In this study, siRNA screening identifies Rab27a as a critical host factor regulating this transport process. GTP-bound Rab27a operates via its effectors, synaptotagmin-like protein 1 (SYTL1) and SYTL4, to facilitate the transport of vesicles carrying viral membrane proteins to the plasma membrane. Absence of Rab27a or SYTL4 does not block the early stages of the IAV life cycle but restricts viral assembly and budding. Notably, silencing SYTL4 provides superior protection in the female mouse IAV infection model. This investigation elucidates the molecular mechanism by which Rab27a and its effectors modulate the transport of IAV membrane proteins, thereby bridging a critical gap in IAV life cycle research and presenting a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs.

Their quasiorder enables optical camouflage, concealing unclonable PUF keys within the background for secure, invisible authentication. 
 Quasi-order in structural coloration, as observed in nature, offers intrinsic, unclonable near-field stochastic fingerprints while preserving far-field uniform colors. However, replicating this balance in artificial photonic metasurfaces remains a major challenge. Here, we present plasmonic metasurfaces that achieve this balance through electrostatic self-assembly of quasi-ordered gold nanoparticles onto a dielectric-spaced metallic mirror. These metasurfaces enable precise tuning of far-field reflective colors across the visible spectrum by adjusting the dielectric gap thickness, while simultaneously generating stochastic near-field scattering patterns that serve as unique physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The resulting scattering PUF keys exhibit uniform bit uniformity (average: 0.501), high uniqueness (inter-Hamming distance: 0.496) and large capacity (~10260), with strong environmental stability and resistance to unauthorized cloning. We further demonstrate the practical applications of these plasmonic metasurfaces in security and authentication, including information camouflage and the integration of hidden PUF keys into identification cards and quick-response codes.

 In eukaryotes, the nucleocytoplasmic export of bulk poly(A)+-mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex is mediated by the ubiquitously expressed NXT1-NXF1 heterodimer. In humans, NXT1 has an X-chromosomal paralog, NXT2, which exhibits testis-enriched expression, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis. Here, we report the in vivo interaction of NXT2 with crucial components of the nuclear export machinery, including NXF1, the testis-specific NXF1 paralogs NXF2 and NXF3, and nuclear pore complex proteins. Binding to NXF2 and NXF3 is mediated by the NTF2-like domain of NXT2. By identifying infertile men with loss-of-function variants in NXT2 and NXF3, we link the impaired NXT2-NXF activity to disturbed germ cell development. The predominant absence of germ cells in men with NXT2 deficiency indicates its critical function already during fetal or first steps of germ cell development. In contrast, loss of NXF3 affects later stages of spermatogenesis, resulting in quantitatively and qualitatively impaired sperm production.

This study shows that endemism of birds increases from north to south, and highlights the vulnerability of southern hemisphere communities to climate change. 
 Endemism is a highly valuable metric for conservation because it identifies areas with irreplaceable species, ecological functions, or evolutionary lineages. Global analyses of endemism currently fail to identify the most irreplaceable areas because the commonly used endemism metrics are correlated with richness, and entire regions, especially low-richness areas in the southern hemisphere, are regularly excluded. Global patterns of endemism are therefore still insufficiently known. Here, using metrics representing irreplaceability, we unveil global patterns of avian taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic endemism that show striking differences between hemispheres. Across all facets of diversity, endemism decreases poleward in the northern hemisphere but increases poleward in the southern hemisphere, resulting in a global north-south increase in endemism. The pattern appears to be driven by smaller and increasingly discontinuous landmasses towards the south which lead to smaller ranges and reduced overlap in community composition, as well as to global peaks of diversity relative to available area in the southern hemisphere. Our findings suggest that there are key areas of irreplaceability that might be missed if analyses are focused on species richness and omit species-poor regions. Highly endemic southern-hemisphere communities might be especially vulnerable to the climate crisis because discontinuous landmasses impede range shifts. Global patterns of endemism (irreplaceability) are still not well known.

 RNA velocity inference is a valuable tool for understanding cell development, differentiation, and disease progression. However, existing RNA velocity inference methods typically rely on explicit assumptions of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which prohibits them from capturing complex transcriptomic expression patterns. In this study, we introduce TIVelo, a RNA velocity estimation approach that first determines the velocity direction at the cell cluster level based on trajectory inference, before estimating velocity for individual cells. TIVelo calculates an orientation score to infer the direction at the cluster level without an explicit ODE assumption, which effectively captures complex transcriptional patterns, avoiding potential inconsistencies in velocity estimation for genes that do not follow the simple ODE assumption. We validated the effectiveness of TIVelo by its application to 16 real datasets and the comparison with six benchmarking methods.

 Ocean alkalinity enhancement is a marine-based carbon dioxide removal strategy that involves adding alkaline material to the surface ocean to boost carbon uptake and storage. The physical circulation of ocean water exerts fundamental control on the dilution, spreading, and retention of alkaline materials, influencing carbon removal effectiveness, environmental impacts, and monitoring feasibility. Here we evaluate potential sites and timing for ocean alkalinity enhancement on the U.S. Northeast Shelf by conducting passive tracer simulations from 2009 to 2017.

A site selection index was developed to assess site and time suitability for tracer dispersal for ocean alkalinity enhancement. Results showed strong seasonality, with optimal conditions in summer and less favorable conditions in winter. Among the tested locations, Wilkinson Basin emerged as the most favorable tracer release site due to its larger spreading area, higher tracer concentrations, and longer decay time.

 The Mekong River, a global freshwater biodiversity hotspot, has suffered from intensive barrier construction, resulting in major challenges in safeguarding its fauna. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of river barriers on the distribution of 952 fish species in the Mekong River Basin. Our analysis revealed that 93% of Mekong fish species analysed suffer from habitat fragmentation, and species with larger habitat range requirements experienced higher river fragmentation impacts. Sub-basins along the main channel in the Lower Mekong had high values of species richness but relatively high barrier impacts. Across all migration types, freshwater-resident migratory (potamodromous) fishes were affected by the greatest levels of habitat fragmentation (Fragmentation Index, 42.45 [95% confidence interval, 38.61–46.62]). Among all International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation status categories, Critically Endangered species experienced the highest habitat fragmentation index (34.48 [19.46–53.52]). Among all barrier types in the Mekong, small dams and sluice gates contributed more to habitat fragmentation than large dams.

 Proliferation of retrogressive thaw slumps has the potential to dominate the sediment yield in arctic watersheds through an influx of hillslope-derived sediment to rivers. We develop a suite of algorithms to semi-automate measurements of thaw slump growth and river suspended sediment concentrations from satellite imagery with the intent of linking the production of sediments on a hillslope to the presence of sediment in an adjacent stream at the seasonal scale. We apply our semi-automated methods to quantify seasonal changes in scar zone area, headwall retreat, and suspended sediment concentration at a thaw slump in the Canadian Northwest Territories, which has doubled in size during the observation period. The semi-automated approaches record up to 30 cm/day of headwall retreat, strongly correlated with warm season temperature, and an approximate doubling in suspended sediment concentration downstream of the thaw slump relative to an upstream control reach. The semi-automated results of the slump growth compare well with previous observations of retrogressive thaw slumps and with manual measurements from satellite imagery. Seasonal patterns in the suspended sediment concentration and thaw slump erosion identify the signal of thaw slump sediments in the river as most prominent during the late summer, when sediment stored in the scar zone can be mobilized by precipitation.

10.1016/j.jag.2025.104679,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该论文介绍了一个名为SZ-plugin的QGIS插件的更新版本，该插件主要用于空间和时空数据驱动建模。它侧重于自然灾害的预测，特别是以台湾的滑坡预测为例。该插件可以进行广义加性建模和多层感知器建模，以估计空间和时间上的敏感性和强度。虽然该插件具有广泛的应用潜力，例如数字土壤制图、野火建模和土地利用检测，但其核心内容与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的相关性较低。,[],Giacomo Titti;Liwei Hu;Pietro Festi;Letizia Elia;Lisa Borgatti;Luigi Lombardo,An updated version of the SZ-plugin: From space to space–time data-driven modeling in QGIS,"•The new version of the SZ-plugin (SZ v2.0) for QGIS is presented. •The susceptibility of a given phenomenon and the relative intensity can be modeled. •The plugin allows the user to predict natural hazard in space and time. 
 The geospatial community usually use GIS environments to handle databases and pre-process their information, whereas complex analyses, especially data-driven ones, are performed outside GIS platforms. This interrupts the flow of information and the processing chain in a number of I/O operations that inevitably slow down the overall analytical protocols. The first version of the SZ-plugin attempted to mitigate this issue by offering a modeling solution within QGIS. However, the available models in the SZ-plugin essentially boiled down to binary classifiers, whose dimensionality was constrained to address pure spatial problems. In this updated version, we focused on two major aspects: (1) a space–time extension and (2) the inclusion of a regression option in addition to the already existing classification one. These two aspects have been introduced as part of two new models, namely, a Generalized Additive Modeling and a Multi-Layer Perceptron. In short, these would allow users to obtain susceptibility and intensity estimates in space and time. An improved graphical reporting tool has also been implemented. This makes it possible to produce relevant statistical summaries as well as cartographic outputs to be directly integrated into technical reports or scientific documents. The problem of landslide prediction is taken as a reference in Taiwan, where ten years of records are available. The example offers an overview of the new plugin capabilities, to which we added a suite of cross-validation options in space and time, automatically run at the user preference. Despite the specific example framed in the landslide context, the same plugin can be used to perform regressions or classifications for any other phenomenon associated with: digital soil mapping, wildfire and gully erosion modeling, land-use or tree species detection etc."
