 As a key source of hydroxyl (OH) radicals, nitrous acid (HONO) has attracted much attention for its important role in the atmospheric oxidant capacity (AOC) increase. In this study, we made a comparison of the ambient levels, variation patterns, sources, and formation pathway in the warm season (from June to October in 2021) on the basis of a continuous intensive observation in an urban site of Beijing. The monthly average mixing ratios of HONO were 1.3, 1.3, 1.0, 0.96, and 0.89 ppb, respectively, showing a larger contribution to OH radicals relative to ozone in the daytime. The emission factor (EF) relative to NOx from the vehicle emissions was estimated to be 0.017, higher than most studies conducted in Beijing. The average nocturnal NO2/HONO conversion frequency kHONO was 0.008 h−1. In the warm season, the missing source of HONO, Punknown, around noontime was 0.29–2.7 ppb h−1. According to the OH production from HONO, the OH production rate from the missing HONO was also very important to the AOC. This work highlights the importance of HONO for the AOC in the warm season, while encouraging long-term HONO observation to assess the contribution of HONO sources over time compared to the capture of pollution processes."

Our study found aerosol hygroscopicity is higher in the SCS in summer than winter, with significant influences from various terrestrial air masses. Aerosol size distribution had a stronger effect on activation ratio than aerosol hygroscopicity in summer and vice versa in winter. Our study provides valuable information to enhance our understanding of cloud condensation nuclei activities in the SCS. 
 Understanding seasonal variations in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity and the impact of anthropogenic emissions in marine environments is crucial for assessing climate change. This study presents findings from two shipborne observations conducted in the South China Sea (SCS) during the summer and winter of 2021. In summer, higher particle number concentrations but lower mass concentrations of non-refractory submicron particles (NR-PM1) were observed, driven by Aitken-mode particle dominance. In contrast, winter showed a more balanced distribution between Aitken and accumulation-mode particles. Summer particles were more hygroscopic, exhibiting higher activation ratios (ARs) at all supersaturation (SS) levels. Distinct air mass periods were identified: in summer, terrestrial air masses from Luzon (“Luzon” period) and the area formerly referred to as the Indochinese Peninsula (hereafter “Indochinese Peninsula” period) and marine air masses; in winter, periods were influenced by mainland China (hereafter “Mainland China” period), a mix of mainland China and marine air masses (“Mixed” period), and purely marine air masses. The Luzon period in summer exhibited the highest particle number concentration, especially in the Aitken mode, resulting in the highest CCN number concentration (NCCN). Aerosol hygroscopicity was higher during the Indochinese Peninsula period compared to the Luzon period, leading to a higher bulk AR due to the combination of higher hygroscopicity and a greater fraction of accumulation-mode particles. The Mainland China period in winter showed a high nitrate fraction in the NR-PM1, but the inorganic fraction was similar to it in the Luzon period, resulting in comparable hygroscopicity at low SS to the Luzon period. However, smaller particle hygroscopicity was significantly lower in the Mainland China period compared to summer. The Mixed period in winter exhibited a higher fraction of accumulation-mode particles, causing a higher bulk AR compared to the Mainland China period. Overall, summer terrestrial air masses increased the Aitken-mode particle and CCN concentration, while winter terrestrial air masses led to higher concentration of large particles and lower hygroscopicity of fine particles. CCN closure analysis, considering aerosol composition and mixing state, revealed that summer aerosols were primarily internally mixed, whereas smaller aerosols in winter were primarily externally mixed. The potential effect of undetected sea salt may lead to an underestimation of aerosol hygroscopicity in summer. This study highlights significant seasonal differences in aerosol properties and the impact of different types of terrestrial air masses on CCN activity in the SCS, contributing to our understanding of regional climate influences."

Meuser;Robin N. Thor;Irene C. Dedoussi,Multi-model assessment of the atmospheric and radiative effects of supersonic transport aircraft,"Civil supersonic aircraft may return in the near future, and their emissions could lead to atmospheric changes which are detrimental to public health and the climate. We use four atmospheric chemistry models and show that emissions from a future supersonic aircraft fleet increase stratospheric nitrogen and water vapor levels, while depleting the global ozone column and leading to increases in radiative forcing. Their impacts can be reduced by reducing NOx emissions or the cruise altitude. 
 Commercial supersonic aircraft may return in the near future, offering reduced travel time while flying higher in the atmosphere than subsonic aircraft, thus displacing part of the passenger traffic and associated emissions to higher altitudes. For the first time since 2007, we present a comprehensive multi-model assessment of the atmospheric and radiative effect of this displacement. We use four models (EMAC, GEOS-Chem, LMDz–INCA, and MOZART-3) to evaluate three scenarios in which subsonic aviation is partially replaced with supersonic aircraft. Replacing 4 % of subsonic traffic with Mach 2 aircraft that have a NOx emissions index of 13.8 g (NO2) kg−1 leads to ozone column loss of −0.3 % (−0.9 DU; model range from −0.4 % to −0.1 %), and it increases radiative forcing by 19.1 mW m−2 (model range from 16.7 to 28.1). This forcing is driven by water vapor (18.2 mW m−2), ozone (11.4 mW m−2), and aerosol emissions (−10.5 mW m−2). The use of a Mach 2 concept with low-NOx emissions (4.6 g (NO2) kg−1) reduces the effect on forcing and ozone to 13.4 mW m−2 (model range from 2.4 to 23.4) and −0.1 % (−0.3 DU; model range from −0.2 % to +0.0 %), respectively. If a Mach 1.6 aircraft with a lower cruise altitude and NOx emissions of 4.6 g (NO2) kg−1 is used instead, we find a near-net-zero effect on the ozone column and an increase in the radiative forcing of 3.7 mW m−2 (model range from 0.5 to 7.1). The supersonic concepts have up to 185 % greater radiative effect per passenger kilometer from non-CO2 emissions compared to subsonic aviation (excluding contrail impacts)."

Vertical changes in the concentrations, compositions, key drivers, and environmental impacts of VOCs were analyzed in this study. We find that VOC species display differentiated vertical variation patterns and distinct roles in contributing to photochemical ozone formation with increasing height in the urban planetary boundary layer. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play crucial roles in regulating the formation of tropospheric ozone. However, limited knowledge on the interactions between vertical VOC variations and photochemical ozone formation in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) has hindered effective ozone control strategies, especially in large cities. In this study, we investigated the vertical changes in concentrations, compositions, and key driving factors of a large suite of VOCs using online gradient measurements taken from a 325 m tall tower in urban Beijing. The impacts of these vertical VOC variations on photochemical ozone formation were also analyzed using box model simulations. Our results indicate that VOCs exhibited distinct vertical variation patterns due to their differences in sources and chemical reactivities, along with the diurnal evolution of the PBL. During daytime, reactive VOCs (e.g., hydrocarbons) are rapidly oxidized as they mix upward, accompanied by the formation and accumulation of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) in the middle and upper layers. In addition, the photochemical formation of ozone responds positively to changes in both NOx and VOCs. As a result, the production rate of ozone declines with height due to the simultaneous decreases in concentrations of reactive VOCs and NOx but remains high in the middle and upper layers. The strong production of ozone aloft is primarily driven by the presence of high OVOC concentrations. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the vertical variations in both photochemical ozone production rates and formation regimes in the whole PBL when developing regional ozone control strategies."

Thomas Arnold;Nandana Amarasinghe;Daniel Miller;Jennifer Small-Griswold;Mikael Witte;Brian Cairns;Siddhant Gupta;Greg McFarquhar;Joseph O'Brien,Evaluating spectral cloud effective radius retrievals from the Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS) during ORACLES,"Satellite remote sensing retrievals of cloud droplet size are used to understand clouds and their interactions with aerosols and radiation but require many simplifying assumptions. Evaluation of these retrievals is typically done by comparing against direct measurements of droplets from airborne cloud probes. This paper details an evaluation of proxy airborne remote sensing droplet size retrievals against several cloud probes and explores the impact of key assumptions on retrieval agreement. 
 Satellite remote sensing retrievals of cloud effective radius (CER) are widely used for studies of aerosol–cloud interactions. Such retrievals, however, rely on forward radiative transfer (RT) calculations using simplified assumptions that can lead to retrieval errors when the real atmosphere deviates from the forward model. Here, coincident airborne remote sensing and in situ observations obtained during NASA's ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) field campaign are used to evaluate retrievals of CER for marine boundary layer stratocumulus clouds and to explore impacts of forward RT model assumptions and other confounding factors. Specifically, spectral CER retrievals from the Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS) and the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) are compared with polarimetric retrievals from RSP and with CER derived from droplet size distributions (DSDs) observed by the Phase Doppler Interferometer (PDI) and a combination of the Cloud and Aerosol Spectrometer (CAS) and the Two-Dimensional Stereo Probe (2D-S). The sensitivities of the eMAS and RSP spectral retrievals to assumptions about the DSD effective variance (CEV) and liquid water complex index of refraction are explored. CER and CEV inferred from eMAS spectral reflectance observations of the backscatter glory provide additional context for the spectral CER retrievals. The spectral and polarimetric CER retrieval agreement is case dependent, and updating the retrieval RT assumptions, including using RSP polarimetric CEV retrievals as a constraint, yields mixed results that are tied to differing sensitivities to vertical heterogeneity. Moreover, the in situ cloud probes, often used as the benchmark for remote sensing CER retrieval assessments, themselves do not agree, with PDI DSDs yielding CER values 1.3–1.6 µm larger than CAS and with CEV roughly 50 %–60 % smaller than CAS. Implications for the interpretation of spectral and polarimetric CER retrievals and their agreement are discussed."

An analytical challenge for PTR-MS measurements is the formation of unintended measurement interferences, product ion distributions (PIDs), that may appear in the data as VOCs of interest. We developed a method for quantifying PID formation and use interlaboratory comparison data to put quantitative constraints on PID formation. 
 Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) using hydronium ion (H3O+) ionization is widely used for the measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) both indoors and outdoors. H3O+ ionization, as well as the associated chemistry in an ion–molecule reactor, is known to generate product ion distributions (PIDs) that include other product ions besides the proton-transfer product. We present a method, using gas-chromatography pre-separation, for quantifying PIDs from PTR-MS measurements of nearly 100 VOCs of different functional types including alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, acids, aromatics, organohalides, and alkenes. We characterize instrument configuration effects on PIDs and find that reactor reduced electric field strength (E/N), ion optic voltage gradients, and quadrupole settings have the strongest impact on measured PIDs. Through an interlaboratory comparison of PIDs measured from calibration cylinders, we characterized the variability of PID production from the same model of PTR-MS across seven participating laboratories. Product ion variability was generally smaller (e.g., < 20 %) for ions with larger contributions to the PIDs (e.g., > 0.30) but less predictable for product ions formed through O2+ and NO+ reactions. We present a publicly available library of H3O+ PTR-MS PIDs that will be updated periodically with user-provided data for the continued investigation into instrument-to-instrument variability of PIDs."

The Heidelberg Radon Monitor (HRM) measures 214Polonium (Po), a progeny of Rn. This study presents Po-based Rn activity concentrations measured with the HRM at 8 stations in Germany with guidelines for estimating Rn from Po measurements. Comparison between modeled and measured activity concentrations show that at high relative humidity Po measurements cannot be interpreted as Rn. 
 Atmospheric measurements of the short-lived radioactive noble gas 222Radon (222Rn) have many applications. Its concentrations are driven by atmospheric mixing as well as seasonal variations, which follow the seasonality of 222Rn exhalation from continental soils with lower values during the wet winter and spring months compared to more dry summer conditions. Hence, it can be used as tracer to distinguish marine from continental air masses or for transport model validation. The Heidelberg Radon Monitor (HRM) is a static filter detector measuring atmospheric 214Polonium (214Po), which is a progeny of 222Rn. These measurements can be used to infer atmospheric 222Rn activity concentrations if the radioactive disequilibrium between 214Po and 222Rn at the measurement site is known. In this study, 214Po activity concentrations measured with the HRM at 8 stations in the ICOS Germany network are presented, along with guidelines for evaluating these data to estimate atmospheric 222Rn activity concentrations. In addition to the established line-loss and disequilibrium corrections applied when sampling through long tubing or from air intake heights close to the ground, respectively, an upper limit for relative humidity (RH) is suggested, where secular equilibrium can still be assumed. At higher RH, aerosol scavenging effects can cause disequilibrium between 214Po and 222Rn. Using comparison with the model this threshold is determined to be at about 98 % RH. A clear diurnal cycle of 222Rn is observed at all German tower stations during the summer and autumn months as well as seasonal cycle with maximum during summer and autumn months. Overall, our results demonstrate that the 214Po-based 222Rn measurements with the HRM are reliable if the equilibrium conditions between 214Po and 222Rn can be ensured, i.e. for air intake heights above 80–90 m a.g.l. at stations located in flat areas during conditions with RH < 98 %."

Thus, it is crucial to understand possible shortcomings in the models. New features of the ESMValTool software package allow one to compare and visualize a model's performance with respect to reproducing observations in the context of other climate models in an easy and user-friendly way. We aim to help model developers assess and monitor climate simulations more efficiently. 
 Earth system models (ESMs) are important tools to improve our understanding of present-day climate and to project climate change under different plausible future scenarios. Thus, ESMs are continuously improved and extended, resulting in more complex models. Particularly during the model development phase, it is important to continuously monitor how well the historical climate is reproduced and to systematically analyze, evaluate, understand, and document possible shortcomings. Hence, putting model biases relative to observations or, for example, a well-characterized pre-industrial control run, into the context of deviations shown by other state-of-the-art models greatly helps to assess which biases need to be addressed with higher priority. Here, we introduce the new capability of the open-source community-developed Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) to monitor running simulations or benchmark existing simulations with observations in the context of results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). To benchmark model output, ESMValTool calculates metrics such as the root-mean-square error, the Pearson correlation coefficient, or the earth mover's distance relative to reference datasets. This is directly compared to the same metric calculated for an ensemble of models such as the one provided by Phase 6 of the CMIP (CMIP6), which provides a statistical measure for the range of values that can be considered typical of state-of-the-art ESMs. Results are displayed in different types of plots, such as map plots or time series, with different techniques such as stippling (maps) or shading (time series) used to visualize the typical range of values for a given metric from the model ensemble used for comparison. While the examples shown here focus on atmospheric variables, the new functionality can be applied to any other ESM component such as land, ocean, sea ice, or land ice. Automatic downloading of CMIP results from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) makes application of ESMValTool for benchmarking of individual model simulations, for example, in preparation of Phase 7 of the CMIP (CMIP7), easy and very user-friendly."

However, inconsistencies in the applied test protocols and the monitored endpoints in addition to a lack of standardized data formats impede comprehensive meta-analyses and cross-study comparisons. To address these challenges, we developed the Integrated Effect Database for Toxicological Observations (INTOB), a comprehensive data management tool that standardizes the collection of metadata and phenotypic observations using a controlled vocabulary. By incorporating data from more than 600 experiments into the database and subsequent comprehensive data analyses, we demonstrate its utility in improving the comparability and interoperability of toxicity data. Our results show that the ZFET can detect toxicity spanning 7 orders of magnitude at the scale of effect concentrations. We also highlight the potential of read-across analyses based on morphological fingerprints and their connection to chemical modes of action, provide information on control variability of the ZFET, and highlight the importance of time for mechanistic understanding in chemical exposure-effect assessments. We provide the full Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data set as well as the analysis workflow and demonstrate how professional data management, as enabled with INTOB, marks a significant advancement by offering a comprehensive framework for the systematic use of zebrafish embryo toxicity data, thus paving the way for more reliable, data-driven chemical risk assessment."

Typically, such frameworks do not consider other factors, including essentiality, health equity, and distribution of benefits and costs. Further, decisions and recommendations lack transparency regarding how they were developed. We developed the Navigation Guide Evidence-to-Decision Framework for Environmental Health (E2DFEH) to provide a structured and transparent framework incorporating a range of scientific information and factors for decision-making. We reviewed current evidence-to-decision frameworks and engaged in an iterative consensus-based process involving 30 experts from 25 organizations in the academic, government, and nonprofit sectors. The E2DFEH framework includes three Foundations that are structural factors considered as part of recommendation development: 1) Essentiality, 2) Human Rights, and 3) Quality of the Evidence. It also includes three core Criteria that guide the development of a specific recommendation, informed by an evaluation of relevant evidence: 1) Environmental Justice, 2) Maximizing Benefits and Reducing Harm, and 3) Sociocultural Acceptability and Feasibility. The framework’s goal is to make the decision process transparent and comprehensive through explicit consideration of core factors important for decisions, leading to more equitable and health-protective interventions."

We present a long-term empirical data set on floating marine plastic debris collected from 1949 to 2020 around Japan in the western North Pacific. We observed three phases: 1) a period of increase (0–104 pieces/km2) from the early 1950s to the late 1970s; 2) a stagnation period, with high abundance (104–105 pieces/km2), from the 1980s to the early 2010s; and 3) a period of reincrease (>105 pieces/km2) from the mid-2010s to the present. The shift from film to fragmented plastic in the 1980s and the continuous downsizing may have caused the expansion of the offshore polluted area, resulting in a stagnation period by enhancing removal. The removal is most likely caused by sedimentation with phytoplankton, as the abundance of the plastic debris during this period was significantly related to the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation, an index of annual primary productivity. The recent increase in microplastics suggests that plastic discharge is outpacing its removal capacity, suggesting that the impact of pollution on ocean surface biota is becoming increasingly evident."

Although these redox properties have been studied extensively in the past decade, questions remain about the respective roles of kinetic and thermodynamic constraints in establishing steady-state redox conditions. In this study, the reduction kinetics of aqueous Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by Fe(II) contained in the structure of reduced ferruginous clay samples (reference Nontronite NAu-1) was monitored with quick-XAS (X-ray absorption spectroscopy). These measurements revealed the occurrence of at least two reaction processes with contrasting fast and slow kinetic rates. According to mass and electron balance calculations, Fe(II) located at the edge of the clay mineral particles alone cannot account for the fast reactivity of the samples, pointing out the presence of electron transfer from the inner part of the clay mineral layer structure to the reactive sites. The Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio in the clay structure quickly reached a steady state after each Cr(VI) addition to the solution. These steady-state conditions were consistent with either a complete depletion of the Cr(VI) reactant for the first spikes of Cr(VI) or a thermodynamic equilibrium between the redox couples, i.e., between structural Fe(III)/Fe(II) and aqueous Cr(VI)/Cr(III), after the pool of fast-reacting Fe(II) was depleted. These results highlight the need to consider kinetic and thermodynamic controls of clay structural iron redox reactivity to predict the fate of redox-sensitive contaminants in the environment."

Not only could active substances in rainwater generate additional reactive oxygen species but water could also react with the photoaging intermediates of plastic. Precipitation and evaporation lead to repeated shifts between the solid–liquid and solid–gas interfaces during photoaging. To investigate the impact of these interfaces on photoaging, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene microplastics were exposed to UVA, UVB, or UVC radiation in common rainwater (CR), rainwater residue (RR), or rainwater-free (RF) treatments. Seasonal field exposure to the corresponding commercial plastics was also conducted. FT-IR spectroscopy was utilized to analyze the chemical changes in both microplastics and commercial plastics. Compared with RF and RR, CR exposure advanced the relative time of carbonyl production in the photoaging process. A model based on local precipitation and radiation data successfully predicted the carbonyl index of field-exposed commercial plastics and highlighted the importance of alternating interface transitions. The increase in the carbonyl index due to each wet–dry cycle was 1.013–5.460 times greater than that of plastics not exposed to rainwater. These findings indicate that plastics undergo different photochemical reactions on different interfaces, and alternating interface transitions can accelerate the photoaging of plastic."

However, studies focusing on low chemical consumption alongside high-purity CaCO3 production are still limited. Herein, a leaching/regeneration-mineralization process for CO2 mineralization to concurrently produce CaCO3 was proposed. First, selective leaching of Ca from municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI FA) was conducted with the assistance of protonated tripropylamine (TPA) at pH = 10.5, with a concentration of 23,500 mg/L. Concurrently, the protonated TPA was regenerated for subsequent mineralization, completing the mineralization kinetics within 30 min. Temperature had no significant effect on mineralization efficiency or product purity. As the temperature increased, the crystal form transitioned from vaterite to pure calcite. The amount of TPA added significantly influenced mineralization performance, exceeding the stoichiometric ratio allowed for nearly 100% of mineralization efficiency and promoted the transformation of the product’s crystal form toward pure vaterite. Based on experimental results and product characterization, a potential proton transfer-based leaching/regeneration-mineralization mechanism was proposed. Under optimal conditions, the CO2 sequestration reached 77.5 g/kgFA, yielding 176 g/kgFA of pure CaCO3. This work offers a promising option for waste disposal, CO2 sequestration, and CaCO3 production in a reagent-saving manner."

Mayta;Pedro Leite da Silva Dias,South American Intraseasonal Oscillation: EOF and Neural Network Approaches,"This study introduces four univariate regional indices to improve the representation of intraseasonal rainfall variability across South America throughout the year, focusing on Brazil. These indices are constructed using two distinct approaches: the linear Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) method and the unsupervised machine‐learning Self‐Organizing Maps (SOM) technique. Both methods are applied to Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and precipitation‐filtered anomalies in the 30–90‐day band over the South American domain. Results demonstrate that regional indices provide valuable insights into intraseasonal South American rainfall variability, including phase and strength, compared to global indices of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO). Despite being computed using only the South American domain, the regional indices capture the tropical‐tropical MJO teleconnection through the zonal wavenumber‐1 structure. The diversity in amplitude and evolution of precipitation, primarily influenced by tropical‐extratropical teleconnections through Rossby wave trains, is more evident when using the non‐linear SOM index. The regional indices also accurately measure the impacts of intraseasonal variability on extreme precipitation events over Brazil. Case studies, such as the 2013/2014 summer drought episode, highlight this ability, when a deficient rainy season severely affected the Southeast Region of Brazil, impacting agricultural production and hydroelectric power generation. During this episode, the regional indices show agreement between drought periods and suppressed precipitation phases, while global indices indicate an inactive MJO phase. These findings underscore the effectiveness of regional indices in capturing intraseasonal variability, offering significant implications for extreme weather prediction and their impacts on South American water resources and socio‐economic activities."

Two fundamental thermal feedback mechanisms namely downward momentum mixing (DMM) and pressure adjustment (PA), are investigated using the High‐Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) model data at different oceanic and atmospheric resolution during 1990–2014. Most models show a stronger PA coupling and a weaker DMM coupling with respect to the satellite observations, which are found to increase with increased oceanic grid spacing, with considerable intermodel variability. The ECMWF MR shows the highest skill in simulating PA, while CMCC VHR shows the highest skill in simulating DMM. The investigation uncovers background wind speed‐dependent variations in the air‐sea coupling. DMM coupling is maximum for intermediate background wind speed, while PA coupling is minimum for intermediate background wind speed. Seasonality in the strength of the coupling is also detected and in the model data, it seems to be controlled by the large‐scale wind speed, which is opposite to what is found in observations. This, together with the fact that simulations with identical atmospheric resolutions exhibit significant disparities in coupling strength, underscore a critical gap in the skills of global coupled models that goes beyond the use of high resolution and involves the critical role of model physics, such as convection and atmospheric boundary layer schemes."

Both AOD and solar zenith angle (SZA) are assessed to have higher feature significance for both DSR and DSRF during the period of the study, which indicates that AOD and SZA are important parameters affecting DSR and DSRF. The dust aerosols have a higher AOD (0.477), a higher scattering capacity (single scattering albedo (SSA) of 0.971) due to its components of mostly mineral sand and floating dust, and DSRF as high as 0.628 with an aerosol diffuse radiation effect (ADRE) of 194.942 W m−2. Comparing with dust aerosols, although the feature importance assessment values of SSA and angstrom exponent (AE) for DSR are more remarkable for biomass burning aerosols, the reduction in ADRE by 69.768 W m−2 may be attributed to the relatively larger effect of absorptive fine‐particle‐dominated aerosols on DSR.

Azaneu,Modulation of the Observed Diurnal Cycle of Precipitation Over the Maritime Continent by the Madden‐Julian Oscillation,"The Madden‐Julian oscillation (MJO) exerts a downscale influence on the diurnal cycle (DC) of precipitation over the Maritime Continent (MC). We assess the characteristics of this downscale influence in GPM‐IMERG data across the western MC, comparing the MJO cycles of daily mean precipitation, DC amplitude, DC timing, and additional diurnal characteristics. During a typical MJO event, islands and surrounding waters experience their greatest DC amplitude 2–4 days ahead of their greatest daily mean precipitation. The MJO has a greater influence on daily mean precipitation over water and on DC amplitude over land. Greatest DC amplitude over land leads greatest DC amplitude over surrounding waters by 3–6 days. Diurnal cycle timing varies systematically by MJO phase in most locations, particularly eastern Sumatra, eastern Borneo and the eastern Makassar Strait where the diurnal maximum may systematically vary in timing by over 4 hours. Over these regions, the diurnal maximum propagates westward before, and eastward after, the active MJO crosses the western MC. As the active MJO crosses, the diurnal maximum gets earlier across western land on large islands, and later across eastern land, creating a west‐east regime divide in DC timing variability. Additional diurnal characteristics quantify further changes in the nature of the diurnal oscillation. MJO‐induced changes in the diurnal timing of convective cloud cover may influence local radiation budgets. These results provide a detailed benchmark for the modulation of the DC by the MJO against which this scale interaction in models may be assessed."

Wet‐bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a standard metric for workplace heat stress; however, its calculation involves complex parameterizations of radiative and convective energy exchange, making it difficult to understand the driving mechanisms behind WBGT changes. To address this issue, we introduce a sensitivity framework to analytically evaluate WBGT's response to meteorological input changes. By examining the form of sensitivity coefficients, we gain insights into the interactive effects of multiple environmental parameters in controlling WBGT. Given constant wind and solar radiation, the natural wet‐bulb and black globe temperatures change at the same rate and direction as the wet‐ and dry‐bulb temperatures, despite considerable differences in their absolute values. The framework, while having state‐dependent sensitivity coefficients, can be linearized, transforming WBGT into a linear combination of temperature, specific humidity, surface pressure, and terms representing wind and solar radiation effects. These explicit and mathematically tractable relations between WBGT and more intuitively understandable variables enable leveraging established theories and methods to understand the driving mechanisms of WBGT changes. We apply the framework to understand the physical drivers of regional WBGT scaling with global warming and extreme WBGT synoptic events. The sensitivity framework also provides a customizable approach to develop locally tuned linear approximations of WBGT, with clear expectations regarding the direction and magnitude of the induced biases. It can also be used to diagnose sources of biases in existing simplified WBGT approximations."

The emergence of kilometer‐grid‐scale global storm resolving models (GSRMs) offers the potential for enhanced details of PBL processes in these complex interactions. This study evaluates the representation of PBL‐coupled and decoupled clouds in nine GSRM simulations against extensive ground‐based observations by the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program, across six sites encompassing diverse regimes such as marine and continental environments in tropics and midlatitude. By differentiating coupling based on the relative positions between cloud bases and PBL tops, our analysis focuses on the simulation of PBL height, cloud frequency, position and vertical extent. The GSRMs generally exhibit commendable agreements with observed cloud structures and PBL diurnal cycles across different ARM sites. In contrast to the relatively consistent representation of decoupled clouds, discrepancies exist between the simulated and the observed coupled clouds, particularly in areas of intense convection, for example, over tropical rainforests and mountainous regions. These biases are probably associated with the models' tendency to underestimate the boundary layer humidity and the frequency of coupled clouds within different ranges of PBL heights.

Using high‐resolution precipitation data from the hourly China merged precipitation analysis (CMPA) Version 1.0 and aerosol mixing ratio data from the Modern‐Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application Version 2 (MERRA‐2) during the warm seasons of 2015–2020, this study employs sulfate mixing ratio (rsulfate ${r}_{\text{sulfate}}$) as a CCN proxy to investigate the distinct impacts of aerosols on warm‐topped and cold‐topped rainfall across the Sichuan Basin (SCB) and the North China Plain (NCP) regions in China. Our findings reveal that in SCB, aerosols suppress warm‐topped rain by stabilizing the atmosphere, reducing the cloud effective radius (re) and potentially weakening collision‐coalescence processes. Conversely, in cold‐topped rain events, aerosols initially enhance rainfall, but subsequently suppress it at higher concentrations. In NCP, suspended dust increases with rising rsulfate ${r}_{\text{sulfate}}$ acting as both giant cloud condensation (GCCNs) and ice nuclei (INs). This enhances cloud re and promotes rainfall across both cloud types. Furthermore, the aerosol radiative effect destabilizes the atmosphere, amplifying these processes. Despite variations in meteorological conditions, aerosols consistently exert a significant influence on rainfall.

It remains unclear how the evolution varies across different parts of individual plumes. We use a large eddy simulation model coupled with aerosol‐microphysics and radiation models to simulate the Williams Flats fire sampled during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality field campaign. At aircraft altitude, the model captures observed aerosol changes through 4 hr of aging. The model evolution of primary OA (POA), oxidized POA (OPOA), and secondary OA (SOA) shows that >90% of the SOA formation occurs before the first transect (∼40 min of aging). Lidar observations and the model show a significant amount of smoke in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free troposphere (FT) with the model having equal amounts of smoke in the PBL and FT. Due to faster initial dilution, PBL concentrations are more than a factor of two lower than the FT concentrations, resulting in slower coagulational growth in the PBL. A 20 K temperature decrease with height in the PBL influences faster POA evaporation near the surface, while net OA evaporation in the FT is driven by continued dilution after the first aircraft transect. Net OA condensation in the PBL after the first transect is the result of areas with higher OH concentration leading to OPOA formation. Our results motivate the need for systematic observations of the vertical gradients of aerosol size and composition within smoke plumes."

 Irrigation uniformity is a key factor in optimizing water use efficiency and maximizing crop yields, particularly in semi-arid regions. This study investigates the use of high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) thermal and visible light imagery, to assess irrigation uniformity in three systems: surface, linear move, and solid-set irrigation. The research aims to quantify irrigation variability, identify its sources, and propose practical solutions to improve irrigation management through UAV-based mapping technologies. Case studies were conducted in surface-irrigated vineyards in the Murray River Valley (Australia), linear move-irrigated peanut fields in the Hula Valley (Israel), and solid-set orchards in Northern Israel. Thermal imagery was used to calculate the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), while the Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI) was employed to assess long-term crop vigor. Irrigation uniformity was quantified using the Christiansen Uniformity Coefficient (CUC). The study revealed significant variability in irrigation uniformity across all systems. In surface irrigation, significant variability was detected between the furrow head and tail due to uneven water distribution, as captured by thermal imagery. For linear move systems, RTK-GNSS monitoring revealed irregularities in tower movement creating a zigzag irrigation pattern, leading to areas of over- and under-irrigation. In solid-set systems, unexpected variability in crop stress was attributed to soil heterogeneity and historical land management practices. UAV-based imagery offers precise insights into irrigation uniformity, enabling targeted interventions. Variable-rate irrigation, emitter adjustments, and customized irrigation schedules are practical solutions for improving water distribution. Future research should focus on integrating AI and multi-sensor data to further enhance irrigation efficiency and provide actionable insights for farmers."

 Surface ozone (O3) pollution affects air quality, human health, and the ecosystem. Understanding the complex non-linear relationship between ozone formation and its precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is critical for policymakers to mitigate the pollution. The Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA) based on classical observation-constrained zero-dimension box model provides the sensitivity of ozone production to precursor concentrations instead of emissions. This makes the box-model EKMA hard to apply in a real emission reduction scenario. Here, we developed an alternative box model approach driven by localized emissions, which are derived from the field-observed concentrations. This model approach reproduced the O3 variations well by capturing the short-term changes of NOx and AVOCs emissions among different phases of pollution control during the 31st World University Games in Chengdu in 2023. The EKMA analysis based on this model approach showed a different O3 response to precursor reductions from the concentration-constrained approach, which overestimated the baseline of O3 concentration. The result from the EKMA analysis demonstrated that the O3 level was most sensitive to NOx due to stringent control strategies during the event and rapidly rebounded to almost VOC-limited regime after the event. The effects of VOCs reduction on O3 control examined by concentration-constrained model approach were less pronounced than those by emission-driven approach due to the lack of consideration of the emission-to-reaction process. Our findings suggest that the emission-driven box model is applicable for developing O3 control strategy in the local scale."

 The Aral Sea has undergone dramatic shrinkage over the past half-century, losing approximately 87 % of its water body, yet how this shrinkage affects the local climate remains unclear. In this study, the effects of the Aral Sea on lake-land breeze circulation and associated water vapor diffusion were assessed by comparing two simulations, before and after the Aral Sea's shrinkage, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Noah regional climate model. The results show that the WRF model performs relatively well in simulating daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures with coefficients of determination (R2) larger than 0.75 and root mean square error (RMSE) less than 20 %, though a neutral performance was exhibited for relative humidity and wind speed, with R2 values ranging from 0.4 to 0.8, and RMSE between 20 % and 60 %. Additionally, the results indicate that water vapor diffusion is substantially inhibited in both intensity and spatial extent following the shrinkage of the Aral Sea, with a maximum reduction of nearly 300 km in horizontal moisture diffusion along the southeast edge of the Aral Sea before its shrinkage, as well as a reduction of nearly 2.5 km in vertical moisture diffusion. Our findings highlight the critical need for protective measures to conserve the Aral Sea's water resources and mitigate the potential exacerbation of the region's ecological crisis."

 Extreme temperature events (ETEs), such as recent severe heat waves, are one of the consequences of climate change and global warming. To better understand their complex behavior and forecast corresponding hydrologic dynamics, investigating their spatial and temporal patterns are essential. We, therefore, analyzed ETEs over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) for both summer and winter seasons using complex network theory. For this purpose, the daily maximum and minimum temperature data were collected from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) database. To determine the level of similarity between two geographic nodes, we employed the event synchronization (ES) method and then constructed the network of ETEs. The constructed networks were next corrected for boundary effects. Network measures i.e., degree centrality (DC), mean geographic distance (MGD), clustering coefficient (CC), betweenness centrality (BC) and long-ranged directedness (LD) were determined to analyze complex patterns within each network. Based on the network measures, we found that the ETEs are more synchronized in winters than those in summers. In addition, the BC and LD revealed that California plays an important role in the large-scale propagation of ETEs during summers, while Texas and the eastern region of New Mexico during winters. Furthermore, the evolution of ETEs from 1979 to 2022 uncovered increasing and decreasing trends for the summer and winter seasons, respectively. We also detected teleconnections near the geographic distance of 3500 km and above over the CONUS. By applying the Louvain method, we detected different communities in the network of ETEs for the summer and winter seasons. We also investigated the effect of time lag, τmax, in the ES method on the complex network results by varying its value from 0 to 10 days. Statistical analyses including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and paired t-test demonstrated significant differences in the results."

 In this paper, based on the observation data of sea surface buoys, 17 tropical cyclones (TCs) occurring in the East China Sea and South China Sea from 2017 to 2021 are synthesized to conduct a force analysis in a two-dimensional radial momentum equation. The analysis evaluates the magnitude, equilibrium, proportional relationships, and spatial distribution features of each force, leading to clarified universal laws. The findings reveal a pronounced radial variability feature in the mean TC sea surface structure. Notably, the regions where the changes are most dramatic are located approximately 80 km from the mean TC center and particularly at 20–40 km. Within an overall range of 0–400 km, the cumulative contributions of each force from high to low are the pressure gradient force, friction term, centrifugal force, Coriolis force and acceleration force. In addition, obvious anisotropic features are also observed. The four orientations can be arranged according to force strength as the right region (240–300°), left region (60–120°), rear region (150–210°) and front region (0–30° and 330–360°). The pronounced pressure gradient force is extremely unstable within the 250 km range of the right (240–300°) and 200 km range of the left (60–120°) regions of the mean TC. The sensitivity of the centrifugal force to radial changes surpasses that of azimuthal changes, and significant variations are concentrated within a radial distance of 50 km. For the Coriolis force, noticeable anisotropic features are evident within the 150 km radius of the 210–330° sector. Additionally, a comparison of the observed radial pressure profile with empirical pressure models was conducted. We found that B parameter values between 0.7 and 1.0 are optimal for our observational cases. Selecting an appropriate environmental pressure can bring the empirical model closer to the observed data. This study establishes a realistic foundation for enhancing existing sea surface parametric wind models of TCs and developing novel approaches, thereby ultimately improving the numerical calculation accuracy for storm surges and other air–sea interactions."

 The present study is concerned with the aspects of stratosphere-troposphere dynamic interaction during major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). The SSW observed in December 2018 – January 2019 was taken for consideration. The influence of the stratospheric polar vortex location on the position of the upper-level frontal zone (UFZ), changes in the steering flows in the middle troposphere, surface temperature anomalies, as well as on the characteristics of the tropopause have been studied using MERRA2 reanalysis data. Analysis has revealed that SSW events influence the location of the upper-level frontal zone (UFZ), subsequently altering steering flows in the troposphere and leading to the development of surface cold waves. Isentropic analysis have shown that SSW caused the intrusion of stratospheric air into the troposphere, which contributed to the intensification of the cold wave. Correlation analysis have demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between stratospheric processes and anomalies of geopotential height in the middle troposphere (500 hPa), exhibiting a two-week time lag following SSW events. Spatial distribution of the maximum correlation coefficient corresponds to the region with the UFZ deformation. In the cross-time interval of the formation of the SSW, 3-dimensional fluxes of planetary wave activity have been calculated. The enhanced reflection of wave activity over Canada during the SSW demonstrated the dynamic influence of the stratosphere on the troposphere, contributing to the formation of the cold wave.This confirms the role of stratospheric-tropospheric coupling in surface weather extremes."

 As the closest sea to the Capital of China, the Bohai Rim region inside the Yellow Sea over complex underlying surfaces is important to the international trade, logistics and environment. It's necessary to depict the detailed three-dimensional spatial structures and temporal evolvements of sea and land breeze (SLB) circulations over this region with complicated coastlines before interpreting their meteorological contributions to extreme weather, climate and environment events. In this study, an identification approach is developed to seize SLB circulations from high resolution datasets in the Bohai Rim region. Improvements are made to replace the wind decomposing algorithm with a newly developed one which is applicable to highly complicated flows over complex underlying surfaces. SLB events in this region of 2022 are identified from 1-km model simulation data along the C-curvature coastline which is separated into the middle, northeastern and southwestern parts. Quantified and comparative analyses are performed in the form of characteristic quantities. Firstly from the mean perspective, quantities such as frequency, duration time, intensity, height, and penetration distance are adopted to investigate the spatial features of both sea breeze circulations and land ones along the three coasts. It is found that both frequencies and intensities of sea breeze events are higher than their correspondences of land ones. Distinctions among the three coasts are evident, with SLB events along the southwestern coast presenting the highest frequency and the strongest intensity. Secondly, temporal evolvements of SLB circulations are investigated along the three coasts at their start, strongest and end stages. Vertical heights of SLB circulations increase from the start stage to the strongest one, and then decrease till the end one. The vertical motion during sea breeze events along the northeastern coast is the strongest at the start and strongest stages. Thirdly, comparative analyses of sea breeze circulations along the three coasts are carried out under onshore and offshore background winds. Under onshore winds, the middle and southwestern coasts experience stronger sea breeze events, while weaker events influence the northeastern coast in the form of smaller horizontal penetration distances and larger vertical heights."

We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic."

Here we show, through field, lab, and virtual reality experimentation, that classical models of collective behavior cannot account for how collective motion emerges in marching desert locusts, whose swarms affect the livelihood of millions. In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals’ neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices.

BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN.

Beale;Robert Wojcieszak,Hydrogenation of CO2 for sustainable fuel and chemical production,"Catalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation is a potential route for producing sustainable fuels and chemicals, but existing catalysts need improvement. In particular, identifying active sites and understanding the interaction between components and the dynamic behavior of the participant species remain unclear. This fundamental knowledge is essential for the design of more efficient and stable catalysts. Because the nature of the active site (metal, oxide, carbide) is the main factor that determines the catalytic activity of the catalysts, this Review focuses on various types of heterogeneous catalysts that have been recently reported in the literature as efficient for CO2conversion to C1 [carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (CH3OH), methane (CH4)], and higher hydrocarbons. We focus on establishing key connections between active-site structures and selectivity, regardless of catalyst composition."
