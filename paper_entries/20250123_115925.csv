Vicente;Olga L. Mayol-Bracero,Measurement report: A comparative analysis of an intensive incursion of fluorescing African dust particles over Puerto Rico and another over Spain,"Measurements of fluorescing aerosol particle properties have been made during two major African dust events, one over the island of Puerto Rico and the other over the city of León, Spain. The measurements were made with two wideband integrated bioaerosol spectrometers. A significant change in the background aerosol properties, at both locations, is observed when the dust is in the respective regions. 
 Measurements during episodes of African dust, made with two wideband integrated bioaerosol spectrometers (WIBSs), one on the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico and the other in the city of León, Spain, show unmistakable, bioaerosol-like fluorescing aerosol particles (FAPs) that can be associated with these dust episodes. The Puerto Rico event occurred during a major incursion of African dust during June 2020. The León event occurred in the late winter and spring of 2022, when widespread, elevated layers of dust inundated the Iberian Peninsula. Satellite and back-trajectory analyses confirm that dust from northern Africa was the source of the particles during both events. The WIBSs measure the size of individual particles in the range from 0.5 to 30 µm, derive a shape factor, and classify seven types of fluorescence from the FAPs. In general, it is not possible to directly determine the specific biological identity from fluorescence signatures; however, measurements of these types of bioaerosols in laboratory studies allow us to compare ambient fluorescence patterns with whole microbial cells measured under controlled conditions. Here we introduce some new metrics that offer a more quantitative approach for comparing FAP characteristics derived from particles measured under different environmental conditions. The analysis highlights the similarities and differences at the two locations and reveals differences that can be attributed to the age and history of the dust plumes, e.g., the amount of time that the air masses were in the mixed layer and the frequency of precipitation along the air mass trajectory."

Chen,The role of OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals in estimating global terrestrial net ecosystem exchanges,"The role of OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals in estimating global terrestrial carbon fluxes is unclear. We investigate this by assimilating OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals alone and in combination with OCO-2 XCO2. The assimilation of OCO-3 XCO2 alone underestimates global land sinks, mainly at high latitudes, due to the lack of observations beyond 52° S and 52° N, large variations in the number of data, and varying observation times, while the joint assimilation of OCO-2 and OCO-3 XCO2 has the best performance. 
 Satellite-based column-averaged dry-air CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) retrievals are frequently used to improve the estimates of terrestrial net ecosystem exchanges (NEEs). The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) satellite, launched in May 2019, was designed to address important questions about the distribution of carbon fluxes on Earth, but its role in estimating global terrestrial NEE remains unclear. Here, using the Global Carbon Assimilation System, version 2, we investigate the impact of OCO-3 XCO2 on the estimation of global NEE by assimilating the OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals alone and in combination with the OCO-2 XCO2 retrievals. The results show that when only the OCO-3 XCO2 is assimilated (Exp_OCO3), the estimated global land sink is significantly lower than that from the OCO-2 experiment (Exp_OCO2). The estimate from the joint assimilation of OCO-3 and OCO-2 (Exp_OCO3&2) is comparable on a global scale to that of Exp_OCO2. However, there are significant regional differences. Compared to the observed global annual CO2 growth rate, Exp_OCO3 has the largest bias and Exp_OCO3&2 shows the best performance. Furthermore, validation with independent CO2 observations shows that the biases of Exp_OCO3 are significantly larger than those of Exp_OCO2 and Exp_OCO3&2 at middle and high latitudes. The reasons for the poor performance of assimilating OCO-3 XCO2 alone include the lack of observations beyond 52° S and 52° N, the large fluctuations in the number of data, and the varied observation time. Our study indicates that assimilating OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals alone leads to an underestimation of land sinks at high latitudes and that a joint assimilation of OCO-2 XCO2 and the OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals observed in the afternoon is required for a better estimation of global terrestrial NEE."

Lind,Does total column ozone change during a solar eclipse?,"Several publications have reported that total column ozone (TCO) may oscillate during solar eclipses, whereas other researchers have not seen evidence of such fluctuations. Here, we try to resolve these contradictions by measuring variations in TCO during three solar eclipses. In all instances, the variability in TCO was within natural variability. We conclude that solar eclipses do not lead to measurable variations in TCO, drawing into question reports of much larger changes found in the past. 
 Several publications have reported that total column ozone (TCO) may oscillate with an amplitude of up to 10 DU (Dobson units) during a solar eclipse, whereas other researchers have not seen evidence that an eclipse leads to variations in TCO beyond the typical natural variability. Here, we try to resolve these contradictions by measuring short-term variations (of seconds to minutes) in TCO using “global” (Sun and sky) and direct-Sun observations in the ultraviolet (UV) range with filter radiometers (GUVis-3511 and Microtops II®). Measurements were performed during three solar eclipses: the “Great American Eclipse” of 2024, which was observed in Mazatlán, Mexico, on 8 April 2024; a partial solar eclipse that took place in the United States on 14 October 2023 and was observed at Fort Collins, Colorado (40.57° N, 105.10° W); and a total solar eclipse that occurred in Antarctica on 4 December 2021 and was observed at Union Glacier (79.76° S, 82.84° W). The upper limits of the amplitude of oscillations in TCO observed at Mazatlán, Fort Collins, and Antarctica were 0.4 %, 0.3 %, and 0.03 %, respectively. The variability at all sites was within that observed during times not affected by an eclipse. The slightly larger variability at Mazatlán is due to cirrus clouds occurring throughout the day of the eclipse and the difficulty of separating changes in the ozone layer from cloud effects. These results support the conclusion that a solar eclipse does not lead to variations in TCO of more than ± 1.2 DU and that these variations are likely much lower, drawing into question reports of much larger oscillations. In addition to calculating TCO, we also present changes in the spectral irradiance and aerosol optical depth during eclipses and compare radiation levels observed during totality. The new results augment our understanding of the effect of a solar eclipse on the Earth's upper atmosphere."

 Climate change raises the critical need to understand its impact on water resources, particularly as hydropower’s role as a flexible, renewable energy source becomes more vital in planning for the energy system's decarbonization. While hydrological modeling represents an established tool for assessing the future evolution of water resources, a key challenge lies in its reliance on data describing the geometry and operation of hydropower systems interacting with the natural stream network. The Italian Alpine Region (IAR) is home to over 300 large hydropower systems (LHS), and its hydrological cycle is expected to suffer major alterations due to climate change. However, detailed and reliable hydrological studies in this region face hindrances due to the absence of a consistent, comprehensive, and openly available LHS source."

Hayley,Compilation and Analysis of Thaw Settlement Test Results: Implications for Prediction Tools and Stress-Strain Characterization in Permafrost,"This study aims to enhance understanding of thaw settlement, a common issue caused by climate change that impacts infrastructures on permafrost. A comprehensive dataset of thaw settlement test results was compiled from existing literature. The dataset was used to compare thaw settlement properties across various soil types and to evaluate empirical tools commonly used for predicting thaw settlement, identifying the most accurate methods. 
 Climate change has already significantly impacted infrastructures built on permafrost, with thaw settlement as the most frequently reported issue. By characterizing thaw settlement tests, an improved understanding of the thaw settlement properties of permafrost sediment can be obtained. Thaw settlement tests involve thawing permafrost samples under an initial load, followed by applying additional load to the thawed sample to characterize its volume change behaviour upon thawing. In the absence of a standardized procedure for conducting thaw settlement tests, characterizing thaw settlement properties has been done using various methods in the existing literature; however, to date, these data have not been broadly compared. This is in part because they had not previously been compiled in a single dataset. This study presents a comprehensive dataset of thaw settlement test results, digitized from published papers and reports. The data are standardized and stored in an open-source repository. Aggregating the data enabled a cross-comparison of thaw settlement properties for different soil types. This was achieved by constructing an idealized stress-strain curve for each test and deriving thaw settlement parameters from the curves. These parameters were then used to compare the thaw settlement behaviour of fine-grained, coarse-grained, and highly organic permafrost samples. Additionally, the compiled data was used to evaluate the effectiveness of various empirical tools developed to predict thaw strain from index properties. The predicted thaw strain values were compared with the measured thaw strains to determine which tool provided the most accurate and reliable predictions for each soil type. The results suggest that a correlation developed by Nixon and Ladanyi (1987) for estimating thaw strain based on frozen bulk density shows the smallest deviation from actual values and exhibits the least bias in its predictions. This dataset is expected to enhance the understanding of thaw settlement and improve its estimation. Used alone or in conjunction with localized data, it can contribute to developing new empirical tools for predicting thaw strain from index properties. Additionally, this dataset aids enhanced characterization of stress-strain behaviour upon thawing, facilitating future efforts in the numerical modelling of the thaw settlement process. The dataset is accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14538524, and the results presented in this paper are based on version 1.2.0 of the dataset (Mohammadi and Hayley, 2024c)."

 This article provides a detailed analysis of the Crocus-ERA5 snow product covering the Northern Hemisphere from 1950 to 2022. It assesses the product’s performance in terms of snow depth and extent compared to in situ observations and satellite data. Compared to its predecessor, Crocus-ERA-Interim, Crocus-ERA5 benefits from improved spatial resolution and better atmospheric data assimilation, resulting in more accurate snowpack estimates, especially in spring in Eurasia. The findings show a good match with observations, though biases remain, particularly in boreal forest areas and some Arctic regions, where the model tends to overestimate spring melt. The production of this snow dataset is motivated by its use by the continental cryosphere community, and in particular by the collaboration between the French National Center for Meteorological Research (CNRM) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), which has been involved in Arctic snow cover monitoring as part of the ""Terrestrial Snow"" section of the Arctic Report Card since 2017.

Rust,Decomposition of skill scores for conditional verification: impact of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation phases on the predictability of decadal temperature forecasts,"The performance of weather and climate prediction systems is variable in time and space. It is of interest how this performance varies in different situations. We provide a decomposition of a skill score (a measure of forecast performance) as a tool for detailed assessment of performance variability to support model development or forecast improvement. The framework is exemplified with decadal forecasts to assess the impact of different ocean states in the North Atlantic on temperature forecast. 
 As the performance of weather and climate forecasting systems and their benchmark systems are generally not homogeneous in time and space and may vary in specific situations, improvements in certain situations or subsets have different effects on overall skill. We present a decomposition of skill scores for the conditional verification of such systems. The aim is to evaluate the performance of a system individually for predefined subsets with respect to the overall performance. The overall skill score is decomposed into a weighted sum representing subset contributions, where each individual contribution is the product of the following: (1) the subset skill score, assessing the performance of a forecast system compared to a reference system for a particular subset; (2) the frequency weighting, accounting for varying subset size; and (3) the reference weighting, relating the performance of the reference system in the individual subsets to the performance of the full data set. The decomposition and its interpretation are exemplified using synthetic data. Subsequently, we use it for a practical example from the field of decadal climate prediction: an evaluation of the Atlantic European near-surface temperature forecast from the German “Mittelfristige Klimaprognosen” (MiKlip) initiative decadal prediction system that is conditional on different Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) phases during initialization. With respect to the chosen western European North Atlantic sector, the decadal prediction system “preop-dcpp-HR” performs better than the uninitialized simulations mostly due to contributions during the positive AMO phase driven by the subset skill score. Compared to the low-resolution system (preop-LR), no overall performance benefits are made in this region, but positive contributions are achieved for initialization in neutral AMO phases. Additionally, the decomposition reveals a strong imbalance among the subsets (defined by AMO phases) in terms of reference weighting, allowing for insightful interpretation and conclusions. This skill score decomposition framework for conditional verification is a valuable tool to analyze the effect of physical processes on forecast performance and, consequently, supports model development and the improvement of operational forecasts."

This paper introduces a method where we blend and collectively interpret five models dedicated to estimating forest canopy height. We achieve this through Bayesian model averaging, offering a comprehensive analysis of these remote-sensing-based products. 
 The development of high-resolution mapping models for forest attributes based on remote sensing data combined with machine or deep learning techniques has become a prominent topic in the field of forest observation and monitoring. This has resulted in the availability of multiple, sometimes conflicting, sources of information, but, at face value, it also makes it possible to learn about forest attribute uncertainty through the joint interpretation of multiple models. This article seeks to endorse the latter by utilizing the Bayesian model averaging approach to diagnose and interpret the differences between predictions from different models. The predictions in our case are forest canopy height estimations for metropolitan France arising from five different models. An independent reference dataset, containing four different definitions of forest height (dominant, mean, maximum, and Lorey's) was established based on around 5500 plots of the French National Forest Inventory (NFI), distributed across the entire area of interest. In this study, we evaluate models with respect to their probabilities of correctly predicting  measurements or estimations obtained from NFI plots, highlighting the spatial variability in respective model probabilities across the study area. We observed significant variability in these probabilities depending on the forest height definition used, implying that the different models inadvertently predict different types of canopy height. We also present the respective inter-model and intra-model variance estimations, enabling us to grasp where the employed models have comparable contributions but contrasting predictions. We show that topography has an important impact on the models spread. Moreover, we observed that the forest stand vertical structure, the dominant tree species, and the type of forest ownership systematically emerge as statistically significant factors influencing the model divergences. Finally, we observed that the fitted higher-order mixtures, which enabled the presented analyses, do not necessarily reduce bias or prevent the saturation of the predicted heights observed in the individual models."

The model accurately replicates experimental data and reveals key transport mechanisms. The findings enhance our knowledge of how microplastics move in nearshore environments, aiding in coastal management and efforts to combat plastic pollution globally. 
 Potentially acting as a source or a sink for plastic pollution to the open ocean, nearshore waters remain a challenging context for predicting the transport and deposition of plastic debris. In this study, we present an advanced modeling approach based on the SWASH wave model and the TrackMPD (v3.0) particle transport model to investigate the transport dynamics of floating and sinking microplastics in wave-dominated environments. This approach introduces novel features such as coupling with advanced turbulence models, simulating resuspension and bedload processes, implementing advanced settling and rising velocity formulations, and enabling parallel computation. The wave laboratory experiments conducted by Forsberg et al. (2020) were simulated to validate the model's ability to reproduce the transport of diverse microplastics (varying in density, shape, and size) along a comprehensive beach profile, capturing the whole water column. Our results underscore the robustness of the proposed model, showing good agreement with experimental data. High-density microplastics moved onshore near the bed, accumulating in proximity to the wave-breaking zone, while the distribution of low-density particles varied along the coastal profile depending on the particle properties. The study also sheds light on the primary mechanisms driving microplastic transport, such as Stokes drift, wave asymmetry, and settling/rising velocities. Sensitivity analyses on calibration parameters further confirm the robustness of the model results and the influence of these factors on transport patterns. This research establishes the SWASH–TrackMPD approach as a valuable tool, opening avenues for future studies to contextualize laboratory findings within the complexities of real-world nearshore environments and further refine our comprehension of microplastic dynamics across different beaches and wave-climate conditions."

Shapiro,Forecasting contrail climate forcing for flight planning and air traffic management applications: the CocipGrid model in pycontrails 0.51.0,"Contrails forming in some atmospheric conditions may persist and become strongly warming cirrus, while in other conditions may be neutral or cooling. We develop a contrail forecast model to predict contrail climate forcing for any arbitrary point in space and time and explore integration into flight planning and air traffic management. This approach enables contrail interventions to target high-probability high-climate-impact regions and reduce unintended consequences of contrail management. 
 The global annual mean contrail climate forcing may exceed that of aviation's cumulative CO2 emissions. As only 2 %–3 % of all flights are likely responsible for 80 % of the global annual contrail energy forcing (EFcontrail), re-routing these flights could reduce the occurrence of strongly warming contrails. Here, we develop a contrail forecasting tool that produces global maps of persistent contrail formation and their EFcontrail formatted to align with standard weather and turbulence forecasts for integration into existing flight planning and air traffic management workflows. This is achieved by extending the existing trajectory-based contrail cirrus prediction model (CoCiP), which simulates contrails formed along flight paths, to a grid-based approach that initializes an infinitesimal contrail segment at each point in a 4D spatiotemporal grid and tracks them until their end of life. Outputs are provided for N aircraft-engine groups, with groupings based on similarities in aircraft mass and engine particle number emissions: N=7 results in a 3 % mean error between the trajectory- and grid-based CoCiP, while N=3 facilitates operational simplicity but increases the mean error to 13 %. We use the grid-based CoCiP to simulate contrails globally using 2019 meteorology and compare its forecast patterns with those from previous studies. Two approaches are proposed to apply these forecasts for contrail mitigation: (i) monetizing EFcontrail and including it as an additional cost parameter within a flight trajectory optimizer or (ii) constructing polygons to avoid airspace volumes with strongly warming contrails. We also demonstrate a probabilistic formulation of the grid-based CoCiP by running it with ensemble meteorology and excluding grid cells with significant uncertainties in the simulated EFcontrail. This study establishes a working standard for incorporating contrail mitigation into flight management protocols and demonstrates how forecasting uncertainty can be incorporated to minimize unintended consequences associated with increased CO2 emissions from re-routes."

Here, we added active and inactive bacteriophages (phages) to soil DOM with original bacterial communities and incubated them at 18  or 23 °C for 35 days. Phages initially (1–4 days) reduced CO2 efflux rate by 13-21% at 18 °C and 3–30% at 23 °C but significantly (p < 0.05) increased by 4–29% at 18 °C and 9–41% at 23 °C after 6 days, raising cumulative CO2 emissions by 14% at 18 °C and 21% at 23 °C. Phages decreased dominant bacterial taxa and increased bacterial community diversity (consistent with a “cull-the-winner” dynamic), thus altering the predicted microbiome functions. Specifically, phages enriched some taxa (such as Pseudomonas, Anaerocolumna, and Caulobacter) involved in degrading complex compounds and consequently promoted functions related to C cycling. Higher temperature facilitated phage-bacteria interactions, increased bacterial diversity, and enzyme activities, boosting DOM mineralization by 16%. Collectively, phages impact soil DOM mineralization by shifting microbial communities and functions, with moderate temperature changes modulating the magnitude of these processes but not qualitatively altering their behavior."

Lemay and Ian C. Bourg,Interactions between Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) at the Water–Air Interface,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)─so-called “forever chemicals”─contaminate the drinking water of about 100 million people in the U.S. alone and are inefficiently removed by standard treatment techniques. A key property of these compounds that underlies their fate and transport and the efficacy of several promising remediation approaches is that they accumulate at the water–air interface. This phenomenon remains incompletely understood, particularly under conditions relevant to natural and treatment systems where water–air interfaces often carry significant loads of other organic contaminants or natural organic matter. To understand the impact of organic loading on PFAS adsorption, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations of PFAS at varying interfacial densities. We find that adsorbed PFAS form strong mutual interactions (attraction between perfluoroalkyl chains and electrostatic interactions among charged head groups) that give rise to ordered interfacial coatings. These interactions often involve near-cancellation of hydrophobic attraction and Coulomb repulsion. Our findings explain an apparent paradox whereby PFAS adsorption isotherms often suggest minimal mutual interactions while simultaneously displaying a high sensitivity to the composition and density of interfacial coatings. Consideration of the compounds present with PFAS at the interface has the potential to allow for more accurate predictions of fate and transport and the design of more efficient remediation approaches."

Notably, the maturation of El Niño prolonged warming in North America through excitation of the Pacific‐North American teleconnection. During the most recent 15 years, GMST has entered an accelerated warming period, primarily driven by rapid SST warming trends in the tropical Indian Ocean, tropical Atlantic, subtropical North Pacific, and North Atlantic.

Results show anomalously low streamflow accounting for the largest proportion of the lake volume departure from the equilibrium state by 2022, resulting in about three times the additional water loss over 1950–2022 as increasing evaporation, which played the second largest role. Precipitation changes played a minimal role. Though streamflow had a greater effect, the lake would not have reached the record low volume without increasing evaporation."

Although the magnitude of albedo changes shows large spatial and temporal variations and a strong land cover type (LCT) dependency, exponential recovery is observed in the majority of LCTs. We show that fires cause long‐term surface brightening, with an Africa‐wide albedo increase of (9.5±0.2)×10−4 $(9.5\pm 0.2)\times 1{0}^{-4}$ 10 months after a fire, but we find this is driven almost exclusively by slow vegetation recovery in the Kalahari region, confirming previous findings. Using downward surface shortwave flux (DSSF) estimates, we calculate the fire‐induced surface radiative forcing (RF), peaking at 5±2 $5\pm 2$ Wm−2 in the burn areas, albeit with a significantly smaller effect when averaged temporally and spatially. We find that the long‐term RF in months 5–10 after a burn averaged over the continent is negative because of the brightening observed. Despite a well‐documented reduction in burning in Africa in the recent decades, our temporal analysis does not indicate a decrease in the overall fire‐induced RF likely due to large interannual variability in albedo anomaly and DSSF data. However, we observe a decline in the short‐term RF in southern hemisphere Africa, driven by both a reduction in fires and changes in LCT distributions."

Here we identify a fingerprint of the South Indian Ocean (SIO) in Antarctic sea ice concentration (SIC) in the cold season, detectable as early as May. Specifically, sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the central SIO excites a downstream wave train, inducing an anomalous cyclonic circulation over the Amundsen Sea. This, in turn, leads to increased SIC in the Amundsen Sea and decreased SIC in the eastern Bellingshausen Sea and the northern Weddell Sea via anomalous wind‐driven forcing and air advection. We further reveal the dynamical processes that establish the atmospheric bridge between the SIO and polar regions. On the one hand, anomalous Rossby wave sources appear over the SIO, attributed to anomalous divergent flows induced by convective and diabatic heating anomalies. On the other hand, the equivalent barotropic response of atmospheric circulation is reinforced by the feedback of storm activities, dominated by eddy vorticity forcing. In a warming climate, climate models project SST warming in the SIO, accompanied by an increasing meridional SST gradient, suggesting that the strengthened impact of the SIO on Antarctic sea ice is likely to continue."

Dwyer,Energetic Particles Produced by Thunderstorm Electric Fields,"In this work, detailed Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test whether terrestrial gamma‐ray flashes (TGFs) may be produced by thunderstorm electrification alone, without the presence of lightning, by the relativistic feedback mechanism. TGFs are powerful bursts of gamma rays produced by thunderstorms, often in association with lightning. They are produced by bremsstrahlung interactions of relativistic runaway electrons with air, typically requiring >1017 energetic electrons to account for the gamma‐ray emissions. These energetic electrons may be produced in the high‐field regions near lightning leaders, or they may be produced by the self‐sustained production of runaway electrons by relativistic feedback involving backward propagating runaway positrons and backscattered x‐rays. It has been challenging to tell which mechanism is correct when lightning is present, since both may occur in the fields generated by the propagating leaders. Prior to 2023, the gamma‐ray emissions from thunderstorms were broadly classified as either long‐lasting gamma‐ray glows or TGFs. However, recent aircraft observations by ALOFT are upending this distinction, showing that gamma‐ray glows are highly dynamic and often morph into intense pulses that resemble TGFs observed from space. It is shown here that rapid thunderstorm charging produces strong gamma‐ray glows with oscillating gamma‐ray rates. These oscillations develop into intense pulse trains that closely resemble the multi‐pulsed TGFs observed by CGRO/BATSE and ALOFT. Furthermore, the ionization produced by the high‐energy particles partially discharges the electric field in some regions while strongly amplifying it in other regions, potentially leading to the initiation of narrow bipolar events and/or lightning."

 Electrons in topological flat bands can form new topological states driven by correlation effects. The pentalayer rhombohedral graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) moiré superlattice was shown to host fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) at approximately 400 mK (ref. 1), triggering discussions around the underlying mechanism and role of moiré effects2–6. In particular, new electron crystal states with non-trivial topology have been proposed3,4,7–15. Here we report electrical transport measurements in rhombohedral pentalayer and tetralayer graphene/hBN moiré superlattices at electronic temperatures down to below 40 mK. We observed two more fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states and smaller Rxx values in pentalayer devices than those previously reported. In the new tetralayer device, we observed FQAHE at moiré filling factors v = 3/5 and 2/3. With a small current at the base temperature, we observed a new extended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) state and magnetic hysteresis, where Rxy = h/e2 and vanishing Rxx spans a wide range of v from 0.5 to 1.3. At increased temperature or current, EQAH states disappear and partially transition into the FQAH liquid16–18. Furthermore, we observed displacement field-induced quantum phase transitions from the EQAH states to the Fermi liquid, FQAH liquid and the likely composite Fermi liquid. Our observations established a new topological phase of electrons with quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field and enriched the emergent quantum phenomena in materials with topological flat bands.  New topological states have been observed in rhombohedral graphene/hBN moiré superlattices, including fractional and extended quantum anomalous Hall effects, at ultra-low temperatures, demonstrating the rich quantum phenomena emerging from correlated electrons in topological flat bands."

 Bipolar disorder is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease1. Despite high heritability (60–80%), the majority of the underlying genetic determinants remain unknown2. We analysed data from participants of European, East Asian, African American and Latino ancestries (n = 158,036 cases with bipolar disorder, 2.8 million controls), combining clinical, community and self-reported samples. We identified 298 genome-wide significant loci in the multi-ancestry meta-analysis, a fourfold increase over previous findings3, and identified an ancestry-specific association in the East Asian cohort. Integrating results from fine-mapping and other variant-to-gene mapping approaches identified 36 credible genes in the aetiology of bipolar disorder. Genes prioritized through fine-mapping were enriched for ultra-rare damaging missense and protein-truncating variations in cases with bipolar disorder4, highlighting convergence of common and rare variant signals. We report differences in the genetic architecture of bipolar disorder depending on the source of patient ascertainment and on bipolar disorder subtype (type I or type II). Several analyses implicate specific cell types in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, including GABAergic interneurons and medium spiny neurons. Together, these analyses provide additional insights into the genetic architecture and biological underpinnings of bipolar disorder.

 The discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene1–5 has generated tremendous interest. The key feature of these systems is an interplay between interlayer coupling and a moiré superlattice that gives rise to low-energy flat bands with strong correlations6. Flat bands can also be induced by moiré patterns in lattice-mismatched and/or twisted heterostructures of other two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)7,8. Although a wide range of correlated phenomena have indeed been observed in moiré TMDs9–19, robust demonstration of superconductivity has remained absent9. Here we report superconductivity in 5.0° twisted bilayer WSe2 with a maximum critical temperature of 426 mK. The superconducting state appears in a limited region of displacement field and density that is adjacent to a metallic state with a Fermi surface reconstruction believed to arise from AFM order20. A sharp boundary is observed between the superconducting and magnetic phases at low temperature, reminiscent of spin fluctuation-mediated superconductivity21. Our results establish that moiré flat-band superconductivity extends beyond graphene structures. Material properties that are absent in graphene but intrinsic among TMDs, such as a native band gap, large spin–orbit coupling, spin-valley locking and magnetism, offer the possibility of accessing a broader superconducting parameter space than graphene-only structures.

 Tissue-resident memory CD8 T (TRM) cells provide protection from infection at barrier sites. In the small intestine, TRM cells are found in at least two distinct subpopulations: one with higher expression of effector molecules and another with greater memory potential1. However, the origins of this diversity remain unknown. Here we proposed that distinct tissue niches drive the phenotypic heterogeneity of TRM cells. To test this, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics of human samples, a mouse model of acute systemic viral infection and a newly established strategy for pooled optically encoded gene perturbations to profile the locations, interactions and transcriptomes of pathogen-specific TRM cell differentiation at single-transcript resolution. We developed computational approaches to capture cellular locations along three anatomical axes of the small intestine and to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution of cell types and gene expression. Our study reveals that the regionalized signalling of the intestinal architecture supports two distinct TRM cell states: differentiated TRM cells and progenitor-like TRM cells, located in the upper villus and lower villus, respectively. This diversity is mediated by distinct ligand–receptor activities, cytokine gradients and specialized cellular contacts. Blocking TGFβ or CXCL9 and CXCL10 sensing by antigen-specific CD8 T cells revealed a model consistent with anatomically delineated, early fate specification. Ultimately, our framework for the study of tissue immune networks reveals that T cell location and functional state are fundamentally intertwined. Profiling of the location and transcriptome of tissue-resident memory CD8 T cell formation at single-transcript resolution finds regionalized signalling as the basis of immune diversity in the intestine and provides a conceptual framework for the study of tissue immune networks."

 Chorus waves are some of the strongest electromagnetic emissions naturally occurring in space and can cause radiation that is hazardous to humans and satellites1–3. Although chorus waves have attracted extreme interest and been intensively studied for decades4–7, their generation and evolution remain highly debated7. Here, in contrast to the conventional expectation that chorus waves are governed by planetary magnetic dipolar fields5,7, we report observations of repetitive, rising-tone chorus waves in the terrestrial neutral sheet, where the effects of the magnetic dipole are absent. Using high-cadence data from NASA’s MMS mission, we present ultrafast measurements of the wave fields and three-dimensional electron distributions within the waves, which provides evidence for chorus–electron interactions and the development of electron holes in the wave phase space. We found that the waves are associated with resonant currents antiparallel to the wave magnetic field, as predicted by nonlinear wave theory. We estimated the nonlinear field–particle energy transfer inside the waves, finding that the waves extract energy from local thermal electrons, in line with the positive growth rate of the waves derived from an instability analysis. Our observations may help to resolve long-standing controversies regarding chorus emissions and in gaining an understanding of the energy transport observed in space and astrophysical environments.

 Seismic tomographic models based only on wave velocities have limited ability to distinguish between a thermal or compositional origin for Earth’s 3D structure1. Complementing wave velocities with attenuation observations can make that distinction, which is fundamental for understanding mantle convection evolution. However, global 3D attenuation models are only available for the upper mantle at present2–5. Here we present a 3D global model of attenuation for the whole mantle made using whole-Earth oscillations, constraining even spherical harmonics up to degree four. In the upper mantle, we find that high attenuation correlates with low velocity, indicating a thermal origin, in agreement with previous studies6,7. In the lower mantle, we find the opposite and observe the highest attenuation in the ‘ring around the Pacific’, which is seismically fast, and the lowest attenuation in the large low-seismic-velocity provinces (LLSVPs). Comparing our model with wave speeds and attenuation predicted by a laboratory-based viscoelastic model8 suggests that the circum-Pacific is a colder and small-grain-size region9, surrounding the warmer and large-grain-size LLSVPs. Viscosities calculated for the inferred variations in grain size and temperature confirm LLSVPs as long-lived, stable features10.

Dubal,The maternal X chromosome affects cognition and brain ageing in female mice,"The maternal X chromosome in female mice impairs cognition through the silencing of certain genes and accelerates ageing of the hippocampus. 
 Female mammalian cells have two X chromosomes, one of maternal origin and one of paternal origin. During development, one X chromosome randomly becomes inactivated1–4. This renders either the maternal X (Xm) chromosome or the paternal X (Xp) chromosome inactive, causing X mosaicism that varies between female individuals, with some showing considerable or complete skew of the X chromosome that remains active5–7. Parent-of-X origin can modify epigenetics through DNA methylation8,9 and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in ageing and disease. However, whether X skew or its mosaicism alters functions in female individuals is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew towards an active Xm chromosome influences the brain and body—and then delineated unique features of Xm neurons and Xp neurons. An active Xm chromosome impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan and led to worsened cognition with age. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by Xm-mediated acceleration of biological or epigenetic ageing of the hippocampus, a key centre for learning and memory, in female mice. Several genes were imprinted on the Xm chromosome of hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. CRISPR-mediated activation of Xm-imprinted genes improved cognition in ageing female mice. Thus, the Xm chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain ageing and silenced genes that contribute to cognition in ageing. Understanding how Xm impairs brain function could lead to an improved understanding of heterogeneity in cognitive health in female individuals and to X-chromosome-derived pathways that protect against cognitive deficits and brain ageing.

 Tolerance to dietary antigens is critical for avoiding deleterious type 2 immune responses resulting in food allergy (FA) and anaphylaxis1,2. However, the mechanisms resulting in both the maintenance and failure of tolerance to food antigens are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the goblet-cell-derived resistin-like molecule β (RELMβ)3,4 is a critical regulator of oral tolerance. RELMβ is abundant in the sera of both patients with FA and mouse models of FA. Deletion of RELMβ protects mice from FA and the development of food-antigen-specific IgE and anaphylaxis. RELMβ disrupts food tolerance through the modulation of the gut microbiome and depletion of indole-metabolite-producing Lactobacilli and Alistipes. Tolerance is maintained by the local production of indole derivatives driving FA protective RORγt+ regulatory T (Treg) cells5 through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. RELMβ antagonism in the peri-weaning period restores oral tolerance and protects genetically prone offspring from developing FA later in life. Together, we show that RELMβ mediates a gut immune–epithelial circuit regulating tolerance to food antigens—a novel mode of innate control of adaptive immunity through microbiome editing—and identify targetable candidates in this circuit for prevention and treatment of FA.

 Rubisco is the primary CO2-fixing enzyme of the biosphere1, yet it has slow kinetics2. The roles of evolution and chemical mechanism in constraining its biochemical function remain debated3,4. Engineering efforts aimed at adjusting the biochemical parameters of rubisco have largely failed5, although recent results indicate that the functional potential of rubisco has a wider scope than previously known6. Here we developed a massively parallel assay, using an engineered Escherichia coli7 in which enzyme activity is coupled to growth, to systematically map the sequence–function landscape of rubisco. Composite assay of more than 99% of single-amino acid mutants versus CO2 concentration enabled inference of enzyme velocity and apparent CO2 affinity parameters for thousands of substitutions. This approach identified many highly conserved positions that tolerate mutation and rare mutations that improve CO2 affinity. These data indicate that non-trivial biochemical changes are readily accessible and that the functional distance between rubiscos from diverse organisms can be traversed, laying the groundwork for further enzyme engineering efforts.

 The development of animal models is crucial for studying and treating mitochondrial diseases. Here we optimized adenine and cytosine deaminases to reduce off-target effects on the transcriptome and the mitochondrial genome, improving the accuracy and efficiency of our newly developed mitochondrial base editors (mitoBEs)1. Using these upgraded mitoBEs (version 2 (v2)), we targeted 70 mouse mitochondrial DNA mutations analogous to human pathogenic variants2, establishing a foundation for mitochondrial disease mouse models. Circular RNA-encoded mitoBEs v2 achieved up to 82% editing efficiency in mice without detectable off-target effects in the nuclear genome. The edited mitochondrial DNA persisted across various tissues and was maternally inherited, resulting in F1 generation mice with mutation loads as high as 100% and some mice exhibiting editing only at the target site. By optimizing the transcription activator-like effector (TALE) binding site, we developed a single-base-editing mouse model for the mt-Nd5 A12784G mutation. Phenotypic evaluations led to the creation of mouse models for the mt-Atp6 T8591C and mt-Nd5 A12784G mutations, exhibiting phenotypes corresponding to the reduced heart rate seen in Leigh syndrome and the vision loss characteristic of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, respectively. Moreover, the mt-Atp6 T8591C mutation proved to be more deleterious than mt-Nd5 A12784G, affecting embryonic development and rapidly diminishing through successive generations. These upgraded mitoBEs offer a highly efficient and precise strategy for constructing mitochondrial disease models, laying a foundation for further research in this field.

 Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression and are dynamic in their structure and function, reflecting changes in the composition of diverse effector proteins over time1. However, methods for measuring the organization of effector proteins at CREs across the genome are limited, hampering efforts to connect CRE structure to their function in cell fate and disease. Here we developed PRINT, a computational method that identifies footprints of DNA–protein interactions from bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility data across multiple scales of protein size. Using these multiscale footprints, we created the seq2PRINT framework, which uses deep learning to allow precise inference of transcription factor and nucleosome binding and interprets regulatory logic at CREs. Applying seq2PRINT to single-cell chromatin accessibility data from human bone marrow, we observe sequential establishment and widening of CREs centred on pioneer factors across haematopoiesis. We further discover age-associated alterations in the structure of CREs in murine haematopoietic stem cells, including widespread reduction of nucleosome footprints and gain of de novo identified Ets composite motifs. Collectively, we establish a method for obtaining rich insights into DNA-binding protein dynamics from chromatin accessibility data, and reveal the architecture of regulatory elements across differentiation and ageing.

 Personalized antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have achieved positive results in the treatment of rare genetic disease1. As clinical sequencing technologies continue to advance, the ability to identify patients with rare disease harbouring pathogenic genetic variants amenable to this therapeutic strategy will probably improve. Here we describe a scalable platform for generating patient-derived cellular models and demonstrate that these personalized models can be used for preclinical evaluation of patient-specific ASOs. We describe protocols for delivery of ASOs to patient-derived organoid models and confirm reversal of disease-associated phenotypes in cardiac organoids derived from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a structural deletion in the gene encoding dystrophin (DMD) that is amenable to treatment with existing ASO therapeutics. Furthermore, we designed novel patient-specific ASOs for two additional patients with DMD (siblings) with a deep intronic variant in the DMD gene that gives rise to a novel splice acceptor site, incorporation of a cryptic exon and premature transcript termination. We showed that treatment of patient-derived cardiac organoids with patient-specific ASOs results in restoration of DMD expression and reversal of disease-associated phenotypes. The approach outlined here provides the foundation for an expedited path towards the design and preclinical evaluation of personalized ASO therapeutics for a broad range of rare diseases.

 The tetraploid genome and clonal propagation of the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)1,2 dictate a slow, non-accumulative breeding mode of the most important tuber crop. Transitioning potato breeding to a seed-propagated hybrid system based on diploid inbred lines has the potential to greatly accelerate its improvement3. Crucially, the development of inbred lines is impeded by manifold deleterious variants; explaining their nature and finding ways to eliminate them is the current focus of hybrid potato research4–10. However, most published diploid potato genomes are unphased, concealing crucial information on haplotype diversity and heterozygosity11–13. Here we develop a phased potato pangenome graph of 60 haplotypes from cultivated diploids and the ancestral wild species, and find evidence for the prevalence of transposable elements in generating structural variants. Compared with the linear reference, the graph pangenome represents a broader diversity (3,076 Mb versus 742 Mb). Notably, we observe enhanced heterozygosity in cultivated diploids compared with wild ones (14.0% versus 9.5%), indicating extensive hybridization during potato domestication. Using conservative criteria, we identify 19,625 putatively deleterious structural variants (dSVs) and reveal a biased accumulation of deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms (dSNPs) around dSVs in coupling phase. Based on the graph pangenome, we computationally design ideal potato haplotypes with minimal dSNPs and dSVs. These advances provide critical insights into the genomic basis of clonal propagation and will guide breeders to develop a suite of promising inbred lines.

 Cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment use various mechanisms to evade the immune system, particularly T cell attack1. For example, metabolic reprogramming in the tumour microenvironment and mitochondrial dysfunction in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) impair antitumour immune responses2–4. However, detailed mechanisms of such processes remain unclear. Here we analyse clinical specimens and identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in TILs that are shared with cancer cells. Moreover, mitochondria with mtDNA mutations from cancer cells are able to transfer to TILs. Typically, mitochondria in TILs readily undergo mitophagy through reactive oxygen species. However, mitochondria transferred from cancer cells do not undergo mitophagy, which we find is due to mitophagy-inhibitory molecules. These molecules attach to mitochondria and together are transferred to TILs, which results in homoplasmic replacement. T cells that acquire mtDNA mutations from cancer cells exhibit metabolic abnormalities and senescence, with defects in effector functions and memory formation. This in turn leads to impaired antitumour immunity both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, the presence of an mtDNA mutation in tumour tissue is a poor prognostic factor for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of cancer immune evasion through mitochondrial transfer and can contribute to the development of future cancer immunotherapies. Mitochondria with mutations in their DNA from cancer cells can be transferred to T cells in the tumour microenvironment, which leads to T cell dysfunction and impaired antitumour immunity."

 Human recombination maps are a valuable resource for association and linkage studies and crucial for many inferences of population history and natural selection. Existing maps1–5 are based solely on cross-over (CO) recombination, omitting non-cross-overs (NCOs)—the more common form of recombination6—owing to the difficulty in detecting them. Using whole-genome sequence data in families, we estimate the number of NCOs transmitted from parent to offspring and derive complete, sex-specific recombination maps including both NCOs and COs. Mothers have fewer but longer NCOs than fathers, and oocytes accumulate NCOs in a non-regulated fashion with maternal age. Recombination, primarily NCO, is responsible for 1.8% (95% confidence interval: 1.3–2.3) and 11.3% (95% confidence interval: 9.0–13.6) of paternal and maternal de novo mutations, respectively, and may drive the increase in de novo mutations with maternal age. NCOs are substantially more prominent than COs in centromeres, possibly to avoid large-scale genomic changes that may cause aneuploidy. Our results demonstrate that NCOs highlight to a much greater extent than COs the differences in the meiotic process between the sexes, in which maternal NCOs may reflect the safeguarding of oocytes from infancy until ovulation. Complete human recombination maps are presented that enable exploration of both cross-over and non-cross-over events during meiosis, with the potential to provide insight into the causes of aneuploidies and pregnancy loss."

 Quantum materials governed by emergent topological fermions have become a cornerstone of physics. Dirac fermions in graphene form the basis for moiré quantum matter and Dirac fermions in magnetic topological insulators enabled the discovery of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect1–3. By contrast, there are few materials whose electromagnetic response is dominated by emergent Weyl fermions4–6. Nearly all known Weyl materials are overwhelmingly metallic and are largely governed by irrelevant, conventional electrons. Here we theoretically predict and experimentally observe a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet in van der Waals (Cr,Bi)2Te3. In transport, we find a record bulk anomalous Hall angle of greater than 0.5 along with non-metallic conductivity, a regime that is strongly distinct from conventional ferromagnets. Together with symmetry analysis, our data suggest a semimetallic Fermi surface composed of two Weyl points, with a giant separation of more than 75% of the linear dimension of the bulk Brillouin zone, and no other electronic states. Using state-of-the-art crystal-synthesis techniques, we widely tune the electronic structure, allowing us to annihilate the Weyl state and visualize a unique topological phase diagram exhibiting broad Chern insulating, Weyl semimetallic and magnetic semiconducting regions. Our observation of a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet offers an avenue towards new correlated states and nonlinear phenomena, as well as zero-magnetic-field Weyl spintronic and optical devices.

 Single-cell genomic technologies enable the multimodal profiling of millions of cells across temporal and spatial dimensions. However, experimental limitations hinder the comprehensive measurement of cells under native temporal dynamics and in their native spatial tissue niche. Optimal transport has emerged as a powerful tool to address these constraints and has facilitated the recovery of the original cellular context1–4. Yet, most optimal transport applications are unable to incorporate multimodal information or scale to single-cell atlases. Here we introduce multi-omics single-cell optimal transport (moscot), a scalable framework for optimal transport in single-cell genomics that supports multimodality across all applications. We demonstrate the capability of moscot to efficiently reconstruct developmental trajectories of 1.7 million cells from mouse embryos across 20 time points. To illustrate the capability of moscot in space, we enrich spatial transcriptomic datasets by mapping multimodal information from single-cell profiles in a mouse liver sample and align multiple coronal sections of the mouse brain. We present moscot.spatiotemporal, an approach that leverages gene-expression data across both spatial and temporal dimensions to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of mouse embryogenesis. We also resolve endocrine-lineage relationships of delta and epsilon cells in a previously unpublished mouse, time-resolved pancreas development dataset using paired measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our findings are confirmed through experimental validation of NEUROD2 as a regulator of epsilon progenitor cells in a model of human induced pluripotent stem cell islet cell differentiation.

 The integrated frequency comb generator based on Kerr parametric oscillation1 has led to chip-scale, gigahertz-spaced combs with new applications spanning hyperscale telecommunications, low-noise microwave synthesis, light detection and ranging, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration2–6. Recent progress in lithium niobate (LiNbO3) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has resulted in chip-scale, electro-optic (EO) frequency combs7,8, offering precise comb-line positioning and simple operation without relying on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. However, current integrated EO combs face limited spectral coverage due to the large microwave power required to drive the non-resonant capacitive electrodes and the strong intrinsic birefringence of LiNbO3. Here we overcome both challenges with an integrated triply resonant architecture, combining monolithic microwave integrated circuits with PICs based on the recently emerged thin-film lithium tantalate (LiTaO3)9. With resonantly enhanced EO interaction and reduced birefringence in LiTaO3, we achieve a fourfold comb span extension and a 16-fold power reduction compared to the conventional, non-resonant microwave design. Driven by a hybrid integrated laser diode, the comb spans over 450 nm (more than 60 THz) with  more than 2,000 lines, and the generator fits within a compact 1-cm2 footprint. We additionally observe that the strong EO coupling leads to an increased comb existence range approaching the full free spectral range of the optical microresonator. The ultra-broadband comb generator, combined with detuning-agnostic operation, could advance chip-scale spectrometry and ultra-low-noise millimetre wave synthesis10–13 and unlock octave-spanning EO combs. The methodology of co-designing microwave and photonics can be extended to a wide range of integrated EOs applications14–16.

 The assessment of research performance is widely seen as a vital tool in upholding the highest standards of quality, with selection and competition believed to drive progress. Academic institutions need to take critical decisions on hiring and promotion, while facing external pressure by also being subject to research assessment1–4. Here we present an outlook on research assessment for career progression with specific focus on promotion to full professorship, based on 314 policies from 190 academic institutions and 218 policies from 58 government agencies, covering 32 countries in the Global North and 89 countries in the Global South. We investigated how frequently various promotion criteria are mentioned and carried out a statistical analysis to infer commonalities and differences across policies. Although quantitative methods of assessment remain popular, in agreement with what is found in more geographically restricted studies5–9, they are not omnipresent. We find differences between the Global North and the Global South as well as between institutional and national policies, but less so between disciplines. A preference for bibliometric indicators is more marked in upper-middle-income countries. Although we see some variation, many promotion policies are based on the assumption of specific career paths that become normative rather than embracing diversity. In turn, this restricts opportunities for researchers. These results challenge current practice and have strategic implications for researchers, research managers and national governments.

 In a dilute two-dimensional electron gas, Coulomb interactions can stabilize the formation of a Wigner crystal1–3. Although Wigner crystals are topologically trivial, it has been predicted that electrons in a partially filled band can break continuous translational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry spontaneously, resulting in a type of topological electron crystal known as an anomalous Hall crystal4–11. Here we report signatures of a generalized version of the anomalous Hall crystal in twisted bilayer–trilayer graphene, whose formation is driven by the moiré potential. The crystal forms at a band filling of one electron per four moiré unit cells (ν = 1/4) and quadruples the unit-cell area, coinciding with an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect. The Chern number of the state is exceptionally tunable, and it can be switched reversibly between +1 and −1 by electric and magnetic fields. Several other topological electronic crystals arise in a modest magnetic field, originating from ν = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3 and 3/2. The quantum geometry of the interaction-modified bands is likely to be very different from that of the original parent band, which enables possible future discoveries of correlation-driven topological phenomena.

Zhang,Scaling and networking a modular photonic quantum computer,"A proof-of-principle study reports a complete photonic quantum computer architecture that can, once appropriate component performance is achieved, deliver a universal and fault-tolerant quantum computer. 
 Photonics offers a promising platform for quantum computing1–4, owing to the availability of chip integration for mass-manufacturable modules, fibre optics for networking and room-temperature operation of most components. However, experimental demonstrations are needed of complete integrated systems comprising all basic functionalities for universal and fault-tolerant operation5. Here we construct a (sub-performant) scale model of a quantum computer using 35 photonic chips to demonstrate its functionality and feasibility. This combines all the primitive components as discrete, scalable rack-deployed modules networked over fibre-optic interconnects, including 84 squeezers6 and 36 photon-number-resolving detectors furnishing 12 physical qubit modes at each clock cycle. We use this machine, which we name Aurora, to synthesize a cluster state7 entangled across separate chips with 86.4 billion modes, and demonstrate its capability of implementing the foliated distance-2 repetition code with real-time decoding. The key building blocks needed for universality and fault tolerance are demonstrated: heralded synthesis of single-temporal-mode non-Gaussian resource states, real-time multiplexing actuated on photon-number-resolving detection, spatiotemporal cluster-state formation with fibre buffers, and adaptive measurements implemented using chip-integrated homodyne detectors with real-time single-clock-cycle feedforward. We also present a detailed analysis of our architecture’s tolerances for optical loss, which is the dominant and most challenging hurdle to crossing the fault-tolerant threshold. This work lays out the path to cross the fault-tolerant threshold and scale photonic quantum computers to the point of addressing useful applications. A proof-of-principle study reports a complete photonic quantum computer architecture that can, once appropriate component performance is achieved, deliver a universal and fault-tolerant quantum computer."

Here, the authors propose a hardware-software co-designed system using random resistive memory, achieving significant energy efficiency and training cost reductions. 
 Visual sensors, including 3D light detection and ranging, neuromorphic dynamic vision sensor, and conventional frame cameras, are increasingly integrated into edge-side intelligent machines. However, their data are heterogeneous, causing complexity in system development. Moreover, conventional digital hardware is constrained by von Neumann bottleneck and the physical limit of transistor scaling. The computational demands of training ever-growing models further exacerbate these challenges. We propose a hardware-software co-designed random resistive memory-based deep extreme point learning machine. Data-wise, the multi-sensory data are unified as point set and processed universally. Software-wise, most weights are exempted from training. Hardware-wise, nanoscale resistive memory enables collocation of memory and processing, and leverages the inherent programming stochasticity for generating random weights. The co-design system is validated on 3D segmentation (ShapeNet), event recognition (DVS128 Gesture), and image classification (Fashion-MNIST) tasks, achieving accuracy comparable to conventional systems while delivering 6.78 × /21.04 × /15.79 × energy efficiency improvements and 70.12%/89.46%/85.61% training cost reductions.

Here, the authors use advanced scanning techniques to image the chiral edge current distribution in the antiferromagnetic topological material MnBi2Te4. 
 The chiral edge current is the boundary manifestation of the Chern number of a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator. The van der Waals antiferromagnet MnBi2Te4 is theorized to be a QAH in odd-layers but has shown Hall resistivity below the quantization value at zero magnetic field. Here, we perform scanning superconducting quantum interference device (sSQUID) microscopy on these seemingly failed QAH insulators to image their current distribution. When gated to the charge neutral point, our device exhibits edge current, which flows unidirectionally on the odd-layer boundary both with vacuum and with the even-layers. The edge current chirality reverses with the magnetization of the bulk. Surprisingly, we find the edge channels coexist with finite bulk conduction even though the bulk chemical potential is in the band gap, suggesting their robustness under significant edge–bulk scattering. Our result establishes the existence of chiral edge currents in a topological antiferromagnet and offers an alternative for identifying QAH states.

Here, the authors assemble seven genomes from different ancestral genetic groups and show the speciation process is accompanied by chromosome rearrangements. 
 Hybridization between wild Musa species and subspecies from Southeast Asia is at the origin of cultivated bananas. The genomes of these cultivars are complex mosaics involving nine genetic groups, including two previously unknown contributors. This study provides continuous genome assemblies for six wild genetic groups, one of which represents one of the unknown ancestor, identified as M.acuminata ssp. halabanensis. The second unknown ancestor partially present in a seventh assembly appears related to M. a. ssp. zebrina. These assemblies provide key resources for banana genetics and for improving cultivar assemblies, including that of the emblematic triploid Cavendish. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses reveal an ongoing speciation process within Musa, characterised by large chromosome rearrangements and centromere differentiation through the integration of different types of repeated sequences, including rDNA tandem repeats. This speciation process may have been favoured by reproductive isolation related to the particular context of climate and land connectivity fluctuations in the Southeast Asian region.

The authors use step-necking catalytic growth to create thick/thin/thick SiNW channels, ensuring efficient gate control and favorable electric contact. 
 Ultrathin silicon nanowires (diameter <30 nm) with strong electrostatic control are ideal quasi-1D channel materials for high-performance field effect transistors, while a short channel is desirable to enhance driving current. Typically, the patterning of such delicate channels relies on high-precision lithography, which is not applicable for large area electronics. In this work, we demonstrate that ultrathin and short silicon nanowires channels can be created through a local-curvature-modulated catalytic growth, where a planar silicon nanowires is directed to jump over a crossing step. During the jumping dynamic, the leading droplet undergoes significant stretching, producing a short necking segment of <100 nm in length, with a reduced diameter from approximately 45 nm to <25 nm. Compared to the FETs with uniform silicon nanowire channels, our step-necked silicon nanowire FETs exhibit substantially enhanced on/off current ratio Ion/off > 8 × 107 and a sharper subthreshold swing of 70 mV/dec, thanks to a stronger gating effect in the middle channel and markedly improved electric contacts at the thicker source/drain ends. These findings mark the pioneering experimental demonstration of catalytic growth acting as a deterministic fabrication method for precisely crafting engineered FET channels, ideally fitting the requirements of high-performance large-area displays and sensors.

However, high dielectric constant (κ) materials, which can be integrated with 2D semiconductors, are still rare. Here, we report a hydrate-assisted thinning chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique to grow manganese oxide (Mn3O4) single crystal nanosheets, enabled by a strategy to minimize the substrate lattice mismatch and control the growth kinetics. The material demonstrated a dielectric constant up to 135, an equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) as low as 0.8 nm, and a breakdown field strength (Ebd) exceeding 10 MV/cm. MoS2 field-effect transistors (FETs) integrated with Mn3O4 thin films through mechanical stacking method operate under low voltages (<1 V), achieving a near 108 Ion/Ioff ratio and a subthreshold swing (SS) as low as 84 mV/dec. The MoS2 FET exhibit nearly zero hysteresis (<2 mV/MV cm⁻¹) and a low drain-induced barrier lowering (~20 mV/V). This work further expands the family of 2D high-κ dielectric materials and provides a feasible exploration for the epitaxial growth of single-crystal thin films of non-layered materials. High dielectric constant (κ) materials compatible with van der Waals materials are desired to promote the development of 2D electronics. Here, the authors report a method to grow Mn3O4 nanosheets exhibiting κ up to 135 and equivalent oxide thickness down to 0.8 nm, enabling the fabrication of high-performance 2D MoS2 transistors."

 The membrane-based osmotic power generation technology can both provide sustainable energy and address environmental pollution utilizing an eco-friendly energy conversion mechanism. Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are an attractive option for this application due to their porosity, well-defined pores and tunable surface chemistry. However, precise engineering of the porous structure for rapid ion transport remains a challenge. Here we engineer the initially randomly oriented COF nanochannels into a highly axially aligned configuration, delivering a metal ion-coordinated COF framework, through interfacial polymerization followed by coordination to different ions, including Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Co2+ and Cu2+.

 Parties to the Paris Agreement submit their climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which outline mitigation targets and strategies to achieve them. While existing research has focused on assessing the mitigation targets, there is a wealth of broader textual content within the documents that has received little attention. Using natural language processing to systematically analyse the full textual content of all NDCs, we identify 21 topics that form seven thematic groups: development, implementation and planning, mitigation targets, policies and technologies, climate change impacts, agriculture and ecosystems, and stakeholders. We also examine how attention to specific topics has evolved over time and across parties. We find that high-income countries, typically shouldering greater historical responsibility for emissions, tend to focus on mitigation targets but provide limited detail on concrete policies being implemented. In contrast, developing countries often frame their NDCs within broader visions of sustainable development, balancing mitigation with adaptation and competing development goals. Establishing a standardized, transparent NDC format could enhance comparability of the plans of parties and assessment of how mitigation targets will be achieved while balancing trade-offs and co-benefits with other sustainable development goals.

 The amplified warming on the Tibetan Plateau (TA) is a distinctive characteristic of global climate change, leading to various climate responses with far-reaching implications. This study investigates the influence of interannual variation of TA on summer precipitation over East Asia (Pre_EA) using observational data and a Linear Baroclinic Model (LBM). When TA exceeds the Northern Hemisphere average, summer precipitation in the Yangtze River Valley significantly decreases, while it increases in North China and South China, resulting in a tripole Pre_EA pattern. Notably, the relationship between TA and Pre_EA is independent of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and explains more variance in Pre_EA than ENSO. Our analysis reveals that TA enhances the tripole Pre_EA pattern by modulating moisture transport and vertical motion in the East Asia-North Pacific regions. Specifically, positive TA is linked to significant local tropospheric warming, which intensifies and eastward expands the South Asian High, creating a double-gyre meridional circulation over East Asia. Additionally, positive TA induces an eastward-propagating wave, reinforcing a midlatitude anomalous high-pressure belt over East Asia and the western North Pacific regions. These circulation changes weaken the East Asian subtropical jet, form a notable double jet configuration, and promote subsidence over mid-latitude East Asia. Moreover, anomalously warm sea surface temperatures in the Northwestern Pacific reinforce the TA-Pre_EA relationship by contributing to the mid-latitude East Asia-North Pacific high-pressure belt. Our LBM model experiments support these findings. Our study provides an in-depth understanding of the physical processes influencing summer precipitation variability in East Asia."

 Northern forests (forests north of 30°N) are major terrestrial carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks, while rapid warming can disturb their CO2 sink function. Here we use multi-year net CO2 exchange observations from 65 northern forest sites to show that the increased net CO2 uptake during warmer springs was more pronounced in old forests (>90 years old) compared to young (<40 years old) and mid-aged (40–90 years old) forests. In addition, the decreased net CO2 uptake during warmer summers and autumns was more pronounced in young forests compared to mid- and old-aged forests. Annually, this resulted in an increase in net CO2 uptake due to seasonal warming for old forests (4.8 g C m−2 yr-1) and a decrease in young- and mid-aged forests (3.2 and 0.8 g C m−2 yr-1, respectively).

 River discharge plays an indispensable role in maintaining the stability of the hydrosphere system and eco-environment. Previous methods that utilize satellite imagery to estimate discharge over poorly gauged basins are generally tailored for large rivers and heavily reliant on ground-based measurements. Consequently, uncertainties often escalate when these methods are applied to medium-sized rivers. Based on Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, this study proposed a framework for estimating the discharge of large and medium rivers with limited ground observations. It comprises (1) a modified C/M method, which considers the spatial heterogeneity of rivers using single-site observation data, and (2) a newly developed method for estimating river bathymetry with zero discharge measurements (RIBA-zero). Results show that, utilizing the modified C/M method, rivers wider than three times the satellite resolution (i.e., 90 m) exhibit a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 0.23 in the velocity estimation. Narrower rivers display a slight increase in the rRMSE (0.41), which is still within an encouraging range. For both types of river widths, the accuracy of flow velocity estimation is higher during high-flow periods compared with the low-flow counterparts. In terms of the flow area estimation, the RIBA-zero method is much more suited for parabola-shaped cross-sections (rRMSE = 0.22) and flood seasons (rRMSE = 0.35). Additionally, when replacing 30-m Landsat 5 TM with 10 m-resolution Sentinel-2 imageries, the approaches make a significant improvement in velocity estimation for rivers narrower than 90 m across all periods, exhibiting great potential to estimate discharge in medium rivers with finer resolution satellite imageries. The framework requires a few ground observations for discharge estimates with the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) reaching ∼0.9, thereby greatly facilitating hydrology-related studies with profound implications for sustainable water resources management worldwide."

 Various techniques have been developed to monitor water vapor because of its important role in weather forecasting and climate change studies. However, high-resolution, spatially continuous water vapor data remain scarce due to the sparsity of ground stations, coarse observational resolution, unavailability of remote sensing data during cloudy conditions, and systematic biases among different techniques. In this study we developed the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) aided algorithms to retrieve Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) from near-infrared (NIR), thermal infrared (TIR), and microwave (MW) observations from the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI-II) and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) onboard the Fengyun-3D satellite. We also proposed an improved iterative tropospheric decomposition algorithm to fuse the multiband PWV data, yielding the NIR + TIR PWV (0.01°), the MW PWV (0.25°), and the fused PWV (0.001°) for Australia. Validation against the GNSS PWV shows that the NIR + TIR PWV has a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.45 mm and a bias of 0.07 mm, implying a 34 % improvement over the operational NIR products in terms of RMSE. The MW PWV shows RMSE and bias of 1.86 mm and 0.05 mm. The fused PWV integrates the advantages of different datasets, further enhancing the accuracy by 15 % for the NIR + TIR PWV and 21 % for the MW PWV. This study made the first attempt to retrieve PWV from three-band observations and delivers high-quality PWV products, which fills the data gap for high-resolution, spatially continuous PWV information."

 This paper introduces IceEB, i.e., an innovative ensemble-based method that is designed to automate mapping of river ice types using radar imagery. Its goal is the merger of outcomes from three classifiers (IceMAP-R, RIACT, and IceBC) through ensemble-estimation, resulting in a highly performant and fully automated river ice-type map, which is applicable under all meteorological conditions. The first step of our research is the development of a meta-classifier and a confidence estimation index, then we validate our method using ground-truth datasets and finally compare the performance between IceEB and the original classifiers. The anticipated outcome was a map exhibiting superior results compared to individual classifiers. Validation and comparison of IceEB employed six RADARSAT-2 HH-HV C-band images that were selected from historical datasets of Quebec and Alberta rivers (Canada). IceEB integrates RADARSAT-2 satellite imagery, a digital elevation model, and a river mask, undergoing preprocessing tasks before activating the three initial classifiers. The meta-classifier then performs ensemble-based classification, yielding a legend comprised of water, sheet ice and rubble ice. This approach facilitates broad participation in validation data collection, differentiation between ice covers and ice jams, and minimization of assumptions regarding ice formation. We conclude that IceEB successfully combines existing radar remote sensing ice- classification models to create accurate river ice-type maps. IceEB’s ensemble-based approach outperforms individual classifiers, achieving overall accuracy >91 % for each class. Shortcomings of the original classifiers are effectively offset through parallel use, resulting in marked improvements in automation and generalizability across diverse Canadian meteorological conditions."

 Wetlandscapes—hydrologically connected networks of wetlands—vary over time, causing changes in their provision of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological functions to landscapes. Here, we developed a method for mapping wetlands and extracting wetlandscape properties from Landsat-derived inundation data and applied this method to the Lake Winnipeg Watershed (LWW). We first mapped the annual (1984–2020) time series of inundated areas using a fusion of two Landsat-derived inundation products, Global Surface Water Extent (GSWE) and Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE), finding that this fusion reduced omission errors from 17 % for GSWE and 18 % for DSWE to 8 % overall. We then used the inundated area maps to identify the topological structure of the wetlandscape, i.e., networks composed of nodes (representing wetlands) and their links (representing hydrological connectivity among wetlands). The time series of the wetlandscape properties (number, size, and connectivity of wetlands) showed coherence with a concurrent increase in precipitation over the watershed. The LWW is transitioning to a more extensive wetland area consisting of a greater number of larger wetlands with increased connections among them (p < 0.1). With Landsat-derived inundation products widely available globally, we suggest using the method developed here to analyze changes in wetlandscape properties in other regions worldwide."

 Regional patterns and sources of wet atmospheric deposition are an important aspect of biogeochemical cycling. The isotopic composition of wet atmospheric deposition samples can serve as a characteristic marker, dependent on local geographical and meteorological factors, providing valuable information about the spatial and temporal origins of rainwater and its chemical load. This study aimed to characterize the δ18O and δ2H isotopic composition of rainfall events to evaluate the relative contribution of different possible origins of precipitated moisture and its relationship with the potential origin of ions (Na+, Cl−, Mg2+, SO42−, Ca2+, K+, NO3− and NH4+) in wet atmospheric deposition samples collected from four sites within the Río de la Plata basin region in South America during 2007. Our results revealed significant variability in the isotopic and ionic concentrations among different rainfall events at each site (temporal variability overwhelmed spatial variability). Most ions appeared to share a common origin with the moisture that carried them before deposition. The isotopic values of δ18O and δ2H were primarily influenced by the distance from the ocean, the origin of humidity sources, and, to a lesser extent, the magnitude of rainfall. The average deuterium excess values (10.95‰) suggested that a substantial portion of the rainfall during the study period originated in the Atlantic Ocean rather than from recycling from the Amazon basin. Events with more negative δ18O-values (i.e. more depleted events) appeared to be predominantly oceanic, characterized by higher amounts of Na+, Cl− and Mg2+. Conversely, events with more positive δ18O-values (i.e. more enriched events) exhibited increased concentrations of terrestrial ions, including K+, NO3− and NH4+, indicating an inland moisture source. No clear association was found for SO42− and Ca2+ and rainfall isotopic composition. Hysplit back trajectory analyses showed that air masses traveling across the ocean contain higher amounts of marine ions like Na+ and Cl−. Conversely, air masses transported across the continent incorporated higher amounts of ions with terrestrial origins, such as NO3− and NH4+.Our findings suggest a tight coupling between moisture, ion sources and air mass trajectories in the Río de la Plata basin region."

 The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations greatly determine the vertical microphysical evolution and rain initiation of warm convective clouds. We investigated the vertical profile of aerosol particles large enough (diameter > 60 nm) to act as CCN in marine air masses over the Great Barrier Reef. Such data were collected during an aircraft research campaign in February 2024. The results show a strong relationship between the microphysical processes measured in the cloud and the aerosol properties measured at the same altitude. The number concentration of aerosol particles decreases significantly above cloud bases due to CCN activation into cloud droplets. For heights above the in-cloud rain initiation level, the aerosol concentrations decrease further due to the scavenging of particles by drizzle and raindrops. The Hoppel minimum in particle size distributions is observed up to the altitude at which the coagulation process intensifies. Furthermore, a tail of larger aerosol particles was measured above the altitudes of rain initiation. These results suggest that the vertical profile of aerosols measured in marine air masses is dominated by cloud processing.Plain text summaryUnderstanding the role of aerosol-cloud interactions is crucial information in accurately predicting the effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Characterizing the properties of aerosol particles found over the Reef is essential in determining their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The evaporation of cloud droplets and raindrops represents an additional source that may influence the concentrations and sizes of aerosol. Here, we show that warm clouds dominate the vertical profiles of aerosol particles in the lower troposphere over the GBR. Our research shows that marine clouds work like a sink of aerosol particles found over the Reef. The cloud microphysical processes (activation of CCN into cloud droplets and the collision and coalescence processes) decrease the concentration of aerosol particles at the same altitude in the lower troposphere. Cloud processing develops the “Hoppel minima” or Hoppel minimum of the marine boundary layer aerosol size distributions as clouds evaporate. The Hoppel minimum is not observed in the particle size distributions above altitudes of intense coagulation processes. Above this level, the ultrafine particles dominate the aerosol concentrations."

 The evaluation of gridded precipitation datasets is crucial for enhancing precipitation accuracy and supporting its applications. This study comprehensively evaluated the performances of six widely used long-term precipitation datasets in capturing extreme precipitation and streamflow over China using two hydrological models. These datasets include one satellite-reanalysis-gauge dataset (MSWEP V2), two gauged-based datasets (GPCC and CPC), and three reanalysis datasets (NECP-2, MERRA-2, and ERA5). The evaluation was performed at a daily timescale for the period 1982–2020. Compared with the rain gauge observations, GPCC provides the best performance in extreme precipitation estimation, followed by MSWEPV2, CPC, and MERRA-2. All precipitation datasets tend to underestimate annual maximum 1-day precipitation (Rx1) and annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5), while they overestimate the extremely wet days (R95p) in dry northwestern China and underestimate it in wet southeastern China. Integrating gauge data into gridded precipitation datasets enhances the accuracy of extreme precipitation measurements. For streamflow simulation, GPCC shows the best performances across most catchments regarding hydrological calibration score (Kling–Gupta efficiency, KGE), except in arid northwestern China, where MSWEP V2 performed best. The ability of precipitation datasets to capture extreme streamflow is associated with considerable uncertainties, depending on the hydrological model used, and no single dataset consistently outperforms others. Besides, the influence of hydrological model selection in streamflow simulations is more significant in dry and high-latitude mountainous regions than in wet and low-latitude regions. This study provides significant insights into the reliability of the latest precipitation datasets and their applications in hydrological modeling, which is expected to serve as a reference for utilizing these datasets."

This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 and O3 in the BTH region from 2019 to 2022. We employed Geodetector, Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to investigate the impacts of meteorological conditions and precursor emissions on PM2.5 and O3 from multiple perspectives: spatiotemporal differentiation, nonlinear responses, and causal relationships. This comprehensive exploration has enhanced our understanding of the interactions between these factors and revealed some intriguing phenomena.Environmental implicationPM2.5 and ozone are major atmospheric pollutants that pose significant threats to human health and the ecological environment, primarily influenced by precursor emissions and meteorological conditions. Clarifying the impact of these factors on PM2.5 and ozone is crucial for providing scientific insights into air pollution control. However, most current studies have not comprehensively explored these relationships, lacking multidimensional perspectives. Therefore, we propose a multi-perspective analytical approach that thoroughly examines these relationships from three key perspectives: spatiotemporal variability, nonlinear responses, and causal relationships. This approach offers a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between these factors."

 Like many small oceanic islands, the Galapagos archipelago, renowned for its unique geographic location and exceptional endemic biodiversity, faces significant challenges under climate change. In particular, the atmospheric water supply for the ecosystem and the local population is under threat, with clouds and rain playing an important role in ensuring freshwater availability under climate change. Better planning of adaptation measures would require climate data on clouds as a prerequisite for precipitation and rainfall at high spatio-temporal resolution, which are not available in this area. Operational products such as satellite derived cloud and precipitation products or reanalysis data are widely used to compensate for the lack of local data availability but are often poorly suited for regional applications. In the current study, we aim to generate high quality area-wide cloud information to distinguish ecoclimatic cloud zones that may require different adaptation measures to climate change. To address this issue, we have developed a new physical rule-based cloud mask retrieval specifically tailored for the Galapagos Archipelago, based on data from the third generation GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) geostationary satellite. The new Galapagos Rainfall Retrieval (GRR) cloudmask was tested against independent observational data and compared to both the operational GOES-16 ACM (ABI Clear sky Mask) and the MODIS cloudmask benchmark cloud mask. Our test results confirm that the GRR-cloudmask (Probability of Detection POD = 0.94, Critical Success Index CSI = 0.92–0.93) clearly outperforms the operational ACM-cloudmask (POD = 0.56–0.68, CSI = 0.55–0.67). Area-wide tests against the MODIS cloud mask showed a CSI of 0.72 and a POD of 0.74 for the ACM, which is superior to the GOES-16 ACM-cloudmask. We produced cloud frequency maps for all months and day slots and analysed cloud frequency using ancillary meteorological data. In general, the cool season (Jun-Dec) / night shows much higher cloud frequencies than the warm season (Jan-May) / daytime. However, regional cloud patterns differ along a west-to-east and south-to-north gradient, depending on complex interactions of forcing parameters such as exposure to the main circulation, sea surface temperature zones, altitude and land cover. A k-mean cluster analysis resulted in nine ecoclimatic cloud zones over land, which are much more differentiated than the widely used four-zone classification. The results will help to develop more site-specific climate change adaptation planning for the iconic Galapagos National Park."

 Understanding climate extremes is crucial for improving forecasting accuracy to minimise the associated loss of lives and property. On 16 April 2024, Dubai, an arid desert region in the United Arab Emirates, recorded unprecedented very heavy precipitation, causing widespread flooding and significant socio-economic impacts. This study investigates the atmospheric conditions that contributed to the event using hourly data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' fifth-generation reanalysis. A composite analysis of precipitation and atmospheric conditions during the event is conducted. Findings reveal enhanced convective activities, likely modulated by large-scale flow patterns and strong low-level convergence associated with moisture transport dynamics from the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Persian Gulf. Strong cyclonic circulation anomalies in the lower to mid-troposphere supported persistent upward vertical motion, promoting deep convective cloud formation. High convective available potential energy and a pronounced mid-level atmospheric trough were evident, indicators of an unstable atmosphere conducive to deep convection. Strong upper-level subtropical jets further facilitated and sustained the convective processes. The combined atmospheric conditions from the lower to upper troposphere provided conditions highly favourable for deep cloud formation, leading to the extreme precipitation event. This study highlights the importance of understanding factors, such as moisture transport dynamics, low-pressure systems, and upper-level jets, in forecasting extreme precipitation in the UAE region. Improving the knowledge of these circulations is essential for enhancing the accuracy of climate extremes forecasting and monitoring, enabling better preparedness and effective, practical anticipatory measures."

 Rainfall in southern China (SC) reaches its annual peak in early summer (May–June), which is often accompanied by the occurrence of rainstorm and flooding disasters. Reliable subseasonal precipitation forecasts play important roles in disaster prevention and mitigation. In this study, the four leading predictable patterns (accounts for 63.24 % of the total variance) of weekly precipitation anomalies (WPA) over Southern China (SC) during early summer and the corresponding signal sources in European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are analyzed. The first and second predictable patterns present uniform and meridional dipole pattern over SC, respectively, while the third and fourth predictable patterns feature with the tripole patterns. Further analysis indicates that the low-level anomalous anticyclone centered over the tropical western Pacific and the lower-level subtropical western North Pacific anomalous anticyclone are the key predictability sources for the first and second predictable patterns, respectively. Although ECMWF shows limited forecast skills in predicting the four leading predictable patterns after 2-week lead time, it can capture the associated large-scale circulation features to a large extent even up to 4-week lead time. Against this backdrop, we develop a dynamical-statistical model (DSM) using random forest to reconstruct these predictable patterns of WPA based on the associated large-scale features in ECMWF. The DSM can extend the forecast skills of WPA up to 4-week lead time over the majority area of SC and increase regional average TCC by ∼0.1 compared to the ensemble mean forecast from ECMWF for 3–4-week lead times. Further analysis indicates that the enhanced TCCs of DSM compared with ECMWF can be largely attributed to the enhancement in predicting the second predictable pattern. The proposed DSM is very promising in subseasonal precipitation forecasts and can also be applied to the routine forecast of other atmospheric and ocean phenomena in the future."

 In 2022, the Yangtze River Basin in China experienced an unprecedented extreme drought, induced by high temperatures and precipitation deficits. Accurate monitoring of such extreme drought events is vitally significant for disaster mitigation under global warming. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two satellite-based precipitation products: the latest Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement Final Run (IMERG-F) v07B and gauge-adjusted Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP-G) v8, using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) to monitor the record-breaking drought. The evaluation was implemented based on the China Hydro-Meteorology precipitation (CHM_PRE) dataset with high-density stations. Results showed that the both satellite products presented satisfactory accuracy for the precipitation anomalies and monthly precipitation estimates. IMERG-F generally performed better than GSMaP-G, especially in the upstream region. Although the satellite-based SPEIs were constantly consistent with the CHM_PRE observations (correlation coefficient surpassing 0.9) in the midstream and downstream regions as the timescale increased, they exhibited greater spatial heterogeneity and temporal differentiation at longer timescales. IMERG-F demonstrated strong performance in detecting historical drought events, whereas it displayed worse reliability for the except 1-month drought estimates, as reflected by lower correlation and higher error metrics. During the 2022 extreme drought, IMERG-F-based SPEI had more reliable performance in identifying the stricken area and severity of meteorological drought. Conversely, GSMaP-G was more effective in characterizing the variability of summer agricultural drought and hydrological drought. These findings can provide valuable insights for the use of satellite remote sensing products in monitoring extreme drought events, offering potential to reduce drought risks and improve disaster management strategies."

We show here that monocular deprivation (MD), an experimental model of amblyopia, reduces the intrinsic excitability of dLGN cells. Furthermore, dLGN neurons exhibit long-term potentiation of their intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) when suprathreshold afferent retinal inputs are stimulated at 40 hertz or when spikes are induced with current injection. LTP-IE is observed after eye opening, requires calcium influx, is expressed through the down-regulation of Kv1 channels, and is altered following MD. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence for intrinsic plasticity in dLGN neurons induced by natural stimuli."

In this work, we provide an algorithmic framework to design short, target-binding linear peptides, requiring only the amino acid sequence of the target protein. To do this, we propose a process to generate naturalistic peptide candidates through Gaussian perturbation of the peptidic latent space of the ESM-2 protein language model and subsequently screen these novel sequences for target-selective interaction activity via a contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP)–based contrastive learning architecture. By integrating these generative and discriminative steps, we create a Peptide Prioritization via CLIP (PepPrCLIP) pipeline and validate highly ranked, target-specific peptides experimentally, both as inhibitory peptides and as fusions to E3 ubiquitin ligase domains. PepPrCLIP-derived constructs demonstrate functionally potent binding and degradation of conformationally diverse, disease-driving targets in vitro. In total, PepPrCLIP empowers the modulation of previously inaccessible proteins without reliance on stable and ordered tertiary structures."

Miniaturizing the quantum devices to meet the requirement in limited space applications drives the search for ultracompact entangled photon-pair sources. The rise of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors has been demonstrated as ultracompact entangled photon-pair sources. However, the photon-pair generation rate and purity are relatively low, and the strong photoluminescence in 2D semiconductors also makes the operational wavelength range limited. Here, we use the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) of rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) as a polarization entangled photon-pair source. We have achieved a generation rate of more than 120 hertz (a record-high SPDC coincidence rate with 2D materials) and a high-purity photon-pair generation with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of above 200. Tunable Bell state generation is also demonstrated by simply rotating the pump polarization, with a fidelity up to 0.93.

Although the rate-limiting step of this reaction is catalyzed by 5α-reductase (5αR), the role of its two primary isoenzymes, 5αR1 and 5αR2, in stress reactivity remains unclear. Here, we found that acute stress led to increased levels of 5αR2, but not 5αR1, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male, but not female, rats. Down-regulation of 5αR2 in the mPFC significantly reduced stress response in males, and similar sexual dimorphic effects were observed in a novel line of 5αR2 knockout rats. Notably, 5αR1 regulated baseline AP synthesis, whereas 5αR2 enabled AP production under stress. Acute AP administration restored stress response in 5αR2 knockdown rats. Single-nucleus transcriptomics showed that 5αR2 enabled stress-induced protein translation in neurons and glia. These results highlight the crucial role of 5αR2 in mediating sex-specific differences in acute stress reactivity."

Mice withNf2deletion develop schwannomas slowly with low penetrance, hence inconvenient for preclinical studies. Here, we show that NF2, by recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases β-TrCP1/2, promotes WWC1-3 ubiquitination and degradation. InNF2mutated cells, WWC1-3 accumulation is a compensatory mechanism to prevent YAP/TAZ hyperactivation and rapid tumorigenesis. Accordingly, we generate a synthetic mouse model with complete penetrance and short latency by concurrently deletingNf2andWwc1/2in Schwann cells. This model closely resembles NF2-related schwannomatosis in patients, as confirmed by histological and single-cell transcriptome analysis. Moreover, a cell line from mouse schwannomas and a syngeneic tumor model in immune-competent mice are established.

We show that individuals with greater stress responsiveness to previous droughts later had higher survival across a severe El Niño drought. Evolutionary models need empirical data on how stress responsivity varies in adaptive ways.

To explore this, we constructed RL-based theoretical models and used multiregional two-photon calcium imaging in the mouse dorsal cortex. We identified a population of neurons whose activity was modulated by varying degrees of RPE accumulation. Consequently, RPE-encoding neurons were sequentially activated within each trial, forming a distributed assembly. RPE representations in mice aligned with theoretical predictions of RL, emerging during learning and being subject to manipulations of the reward function. Interareal comparisons revealed a region-specific code, with higher-order cortical regions exhibiting long-term encoding of RPE accumulation.

However, its significance in the developmental process is not fully understood. Here, we found that birth-induced alteration of glutamine metabolism in radial glia (RG), the embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs), is required for the acquisition of quiescence and long-term maintenance of postnatal NSCs. Preterm birth impairs this cellular process, leading to transient hyperactivation of RG. Consequently, in the postnatal brain, the NSC pool is depleted and neurogenesis is decreased. We also found that the maintenance of quiescent RG after preterm birth improves postnatal neurogenesis. This study demonstrates the significance of birth in the maintenance of quiescent NSCs."

Notably, the colors of the bioluminescent proteins must sufficiently vary to enable simultaneous detection. Here, we aimed to introduce a method that can be used to expand the color variation by tuning dual-acceptor bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. Using this approach, we could visualize multiple targets with up to 20 colors through single-shot acquisition using a color complementary metal-oxide semiconductor camera. Overall, this method enables simple and simultaneous observation of multiple biological targets and phenomena."
10.1126/sciadv.adq9374,False,Science Advances,这篇论文研究的是减数分裂过程中同源染色体配对的分子机制，重点关注了一种名为联会复合体(SC)的蛋白质结构。研究人员发现，一种名为SYP-4的蛋白质的突变会影响联会复合体的结构，进而干扰染色体间的交叉互换，但并不影响联会复合体的组装。他们利用三维随机光学重建显微镜(3D-STORM)技术对野生型和突变型线虫的联会复合体进行了超分辨率成像分析，发现了联会复合体结构的改变与交叉互换的指定有关。这项研究属于细胞生物学和遗传学领域，与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等没有任何关系。,[],Simone Köhler;Michal Wojcik;Ke Xu;Abby F. Dernburg,Dynamic molecular architecture of the synaptonemal complex,"During meiosis, pairing between homologous chromosomes is stabilized by the assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC). The SC ensures the formation of crossovers between homologous chromosomes and regulates their distribution. However, how the SC regulates crossover formation remains elusive. We isolated an unusual mutation inCaenorhabditis elegansthat disrupts crossover interference but not SC assembly. This mutation alters the unique C terminal domain of an essential SC protein, SYP-4, a likely ortholog of the vertebrate SC protein SIX6OS1. We use three-dimensional stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (3D-STORM) to interrogate the molecular architecture of the SC from wild-type and mutantC. elegansanimals. Using a probabilistic mapping approach to analyze super-resolution image data, we detect changes in the organization of the synaptonemal complex in wild-type animals that coincide with crossover designation. We also found that oursyp-4mutant perturbs SC architecture. Our findings add to growing evidence that the SC is an active material whose molecular organization contributes to chromosome-wide crossover regulation."

In this study, however, we found that TAZ, but not YAP, is associated with the Golgi apparatus in macrophages activated via Toll-like receptor ligands during the resolution phase of inflammation. Golgi-associated TAZ enhanced vesicle trafficking and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in M1 macrophage independent of the Hippo pathway. Depletion of TAZ in tumor-associated macrophages promoted tumor growth by suppressing the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Moreover, in a diet-induced metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis model, macrophage-specific deletion of TAZ ameliorated liver inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. Thus, targeted therapies being developed against YAP/TAZ-TEAD are ineffective in macrophages. Together, our results introduce Golgi-associated TAZ as a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention to treat tumor progression and chronic inflammatory diseases."

Inspired by the spiral structure ofAloe polyphyllaand the processing principles of neuronal systems, this study presents a digital channel–enabled distributed force decoding strategy, resulting in a phygital tactile sensing system named PhyTac. This innovative system effectively prevents marker overlap and accurately identifies multipoint stimuli up to 368 regions from coupled signals. By integrating physics into model training, we reduce the dataset size to just 45 kilobytes, surpassing conventional methods that typically exceed 1 gigabyte. Results demonstrate PhyTac’s impressive fidelity of 97.7% across a sensing range of 0.5 to 25 newtons, enabling diverse applications in medical evaluation, sports training, virtual reality, and robotics. This research not only enhances our understanding of hand-centric actions but also highlights the convergence of physical and digital realms, paving the way for advancements in AI-based sensor technologies."

Sack,Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation regulates monocytic type I interferon signaling via histone acetylation,"Although lipid-derived acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) is a major carbon source for histone acetylation, the contribution of fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) to this process remains poorly characterized. To investigate this, we generated mitochondrial acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1, distal FAO enzyme) knockout macrophages.13C-carbon tracing confirmed reduced FA-derived carbon incorporation into histone H3, and RNA sequencing identified diminished interferon-stimulated gene expression in the absence of ACAT1. Chromatin accessibility at theStat1locus was diminished in ACAT1−/−cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated reduced acetyl-H3 binding toStat1promoter/enhancer regions, and increasing histone acetylation rescuedStat1expression. Interferon-β release was blunted in ACAT1−/−and recovered by ACAT1 reconstitution. Furthermore, ACAT1-dependent histone acetylation required an intact acetylcarnitine shuttle. Last, obese subjects’ monocytes exhibited increased ACAT1 and histone acetylation levels. Thus, our study identifies an intriguing link between FAO-mediated epigenetic control of type I interferon signaling and uncovers a potential mechanistic nexus between obesity and type I interferon signaling."

The Nidx2−y2–derived bands show a mass enhancement (m*/mDFT) of 2 to 3, while the 3D electron band shows negligible band renormalization. Moreover, the Nidx2−y2–derived states also display a band dispersion anomaly at higher binding energy, reminiscent of the waterfall feature and kinks observed in cuprates."
