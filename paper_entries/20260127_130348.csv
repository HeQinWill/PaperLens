Daniel;Chelsea R. Thompson;Luke M. Western,A new production-based model for estimating emissions and banks of ODSs: application to HCFC-141b,"This study presents a new bottom-up model to estimate emissions and banks of long-lived ozone-depleting substances. It is applied here to HCFC-141b. Calculated global emission trends are qualitatively consistent with atmospheric observations from 1990–2017. However, they diverge after 2017, suggesting either a growing additional source or a model deficiency. The easily recoverable portion of the bank is projected to be smaller than previously estimated, impacting future recovery feasibility. 
 The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer requires that the production of long-lived ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) that are intended for use in emissive applications be phased out. The Protocol does not, however, limit the release to the atmosphere of ODSs already existing in such applications and equipment. Accounting for emissions from these “banked” ODSs (e.g., in insulating foams) is important for monitoring the success of and compliance with the Protocol, for understanding where further mitigation of ODS emissions might be effective, and for estimating future ozone depletion. Here, we present a new bottom-up model that incorporates existing use and life-cycle information to calculate emissions and banks as well as uncertainties in the quantities. To demonstrate the model, we apply it to 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b), a chemical used primarily in foam insulation and whose production is currently being phased out. We calculate global emission trends that are qualitatively similar to those derived from atmospheric measurements from 1990 to 2017. After 2017, our calculated emissions no longer track the observationally based trends through the end of the comparison in 2021. This discrepancy suggests either a growing additional source of emissions that is inconsistent with reported production or a model deficiency that was not apparent before 2017. Our calculations also show that the easily recoverable portion of the bank will be smaller in the future than the total bank estimated in other recent work, with implications for the feasibility of recovering banks before the release of HCFC-141b to the atmosphere."

Miller,Methane fluxes from Arctic & boreal North America: comparisons between process-based estimates and atmospheric observations,"We find that the state-of-the-art process-based methane flux models have both lower flux magnitude and reduced inter-model uncertainty compared to a previous model inter-comparison from over a decade ago. Despite these improvements, methane flux estimates from process-based models are still likely too high compared to atmospheric observations. We also find that models with simpler parameterizations often result in better agreement with atmospheric observations in high-latitude North America. 
 Methane (CH4) flux estimates from high-latitude North American wetlands remain highly uncertain in magnitude, seasonality, and spatial distribution. In this study, we evaluate a decade (2007–2017) of CH4 flux estimates by comparing 16 process-based models with atmospheric CH4 observations collected from in situ towers. We compare the Global Carbon Project (GCP) process-based models with a model inter-comparison from a decade earlier called The Wetland and Wetland CH4 Intercomparison of Models Project (WETCHIMP). Our analysis reveals that the GCP models have a much smaller inter-model uncertainty and have an average magnitude that is a factor of 1.5 smaller across Canada and Alaska. However, current GCP models likely overestimate wetland fluxes by a factor of two or more across Canada and Alaska based on tower-based atmospheric CH4 observations. The differences in flux magnitudes among GCP models are more likely driven by uncertainties in the amount of soil carbon or spatial extent of inundation than in temperature relationships, such as Q10 factors. The GCP models do not agree on the timing and amplitude of the seasonal cycle, and we find that models with a seasonal peak in July and August show the best agreement with atmospheric observations. Models that exhibit the best fit to atmospheric observation also have a similar spatial distribution; these models concentrate fluxes near Canada's Hudson Bay Lowlands. Current, state-of-the-art process-based models are much more consistent with atmospheric observations than models from a decade ago, but our analysis shows that there are still numerous opportunities for improvement."

We analyze data collected using MethaneAIR to assess methane emissions in regions accounting for 70 % of United States onshore oil/gas production in 2023. We estimate total oil/gas methane emissions across all measured regions to be ~8 Tg/yr, equivalent to 1.6 % of produced gas, which is five times higher than reported by the US Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Mitigation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector is an effective way to reduce the near-term climate warming and losses of a valuable energy resource. The oil and gas value chain contributes at least 25 % of anthropogenic methane emissions globally and is the second largest methane-emitting sector in the United States. Here, we assess methane emissions in regions accounting for 70 % of US onshore oil and gas production in 2023 using data collected by the MethaneAIR airborne imaging spectrometer. We quantify total methane emissions across all observed regions to be ∼ 9 (7.8–10) Tg yr−1, with ∼ 90 % of emissions estimated from the oil and gas sector (∼ 8 Tg yr−1, equivalent to a methane loss rate of 1.6 % of gross gas production), which is about five times higher than reported by the US EPA. Both oil and gas emissions and gas production-normalized methane loss rates varied considerably by basin. Highly productive basins such as the Permian, Appalachian, and Haynesville-Bossier had the highest methane emissions (95–314 t h−1), whereas lower producing basins possibly associated with older infrastructure such as the Uinta and Piceance had higher loss rates (> 7 %). We found good agreement across total emissions quantified by MethaneAIR and other empirical and remote sensing estimates at national/basin/target-level scales. This work underscores the increasing value of remote sensing data for quantifying methane emissions, characterizing intensity of methane losses across the oil and gas sector, and mapping inter-basin emissions variability, which are all critical for tracking methane mitigation targets set by industry and governments."

We observed that particles originating near the surface are smaller than those falling from higher altitudes. Inland Antarctic particles of frozen fog occur at lower concentrations and are less complex than those observed in an urban, polluted environment. These findings can help to improve Antarctic climate models and to accurately interpret satellite observations of the polar atmosphere. 
 The Antarctic plateau, one of the coldest and cleanest regions of our planet, experiences almost exclusively frozen precipitation. Understanding the microphysical properties of inland Antarctic boundary layer ice particles with sizes below a few hundred micrometers is essential to improve atmospheric models and accurately validate remote sensing data for this region. Currently, only a small number of in situ atmospheric measurements exist for particle sizes smaller than 100 µm on the Antarctic plateau, performed over short measurement times. We present the first multi-week study of optical in situ measurements of boundary layer ice particle size, shape and morphological complexity for sizes down to 11 µm with a temporal resolution in the order of minutes, including a multi-day ice fog event. Classifying ice fog events with a lidar system, we found mean particle sizes smaller than 11 µm for ice fog events and of about 70 µm for cirrus precipitation and diamond dust events. The mean particle concentration of the ice fog at Dome C (3.9 L−1) is found to be lower than in parametrisations of Arctic ice fog and lower than the concentration of anthropogenically influenced urban ice fog measured at Fairbanks, Alaska during a three-year study with the same instrument (90 L−1). Moreover, ice fog particles at Dome C are found to be more pristine than at Fairbanks.  Our findings show that Antarctic boundary layer ice particles may need to be parametrised differently than their Arctic counterparts due to distinct conditions on the Antarctic plateau."

In our cloud chamber experiments, we found that for small ice crystals, the depolarisation ratio is more strongly influenced by particle size than by nano-scale structure. The measured trends could be reproduced with numerical simulations. This result helps improve the interpretation of remote sensing data and the accuracy of light scattering models. 
 Space-borne lidar, in combination with other remote sensing instrumentation, has been used to infer vertical profiles of ice cloud properties from A-train satellites, and more recently, also from the newly launched EarthCARE mission. However, accurately retrieving ice crystal microphysical properties from lidar signals requires a thorough understanding of their relationship to backscattering characteristics. Cloud chambers can be used to study the link under a controlled environment. This study investigates the link between the linear depolarisation ratio in the near-backscattering direction (178°) and the ice microphysical properties for 47 cloud experiments at cirrus temperatures between −75 and −39 °C. Predominantly small (diameter<70 µm) columnar and irregularly shaped ice crystals were grown under distinct conditions of supersaturation with respect to ice. A statistical and visual analysis of size, shape and morphological complexity reveals that more than 40 % of the columnar particles exhibit hollowness on the basal facets. Ice crystals larger than 10 µm show depolarisation ratios below 0.3, which is lower than typical values observed in mid-latitude cirrus but in agreement with polar cirrus observations. Two temperature-dependent depolarisation ratio–size modes were found and successfully reproduced with ray tracing simulations of hollow columns incorporating surface roughness, hollowness and internal scattering. These results are important for the interpretation of the linear depolarisation ratio of small ice crystals in active remote sensing or can be used for evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art optical particle models, especially for small size parameters below 100."

Using an improved atmospheric model, we show that changes in tiny airborne particles influence ozone differently in winter and summer: reduced particles boost winter ozone through sunlight-driven reactions, while summer ozone responds to chemical reactions on particle surfaces. These findings highlight the need to consider particle-ozone interactions in air quality and climate policies to avoid unintended effects. 
 Despite substantial reductions in PM2.5 and other pollutants, ozone (O3) in eastern China has increased over the past decade, yet the influence of aerosol processes – including aerosol–radiation interactions (ARI) and heterogeneous chemistry (HET) – on these trends remains insufficiently explored, particularly during Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP, Phase I: 2013–2017; Phase II: 2018–2020) and under carbon neutrality pathways. We applied a phase- and season-resolved WRF-Chem framework with explicit ARI and HET to quantify historical and projected O3 changes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), linking aerosol effects with CAAP and carbon-neutrality pathways. We separate O3 changes into those driven directly by anthropogenic emissions and meteorological variability, and those mediated by aerosol processes through ARI and HET. The results revealed that anthropogenic emissions and meteorological variability respectively dominated winter and summer O3 increases. Winter O3 increases were dominated by ARI: large aerosol reductions enhanced solar radiation, temperature, and photolysis, resulting in a photochemical O3 rise (+1.14 (+0.74) ppb in Phase I (II)). Summer O3 was more sensitive to HET. In Phase I, aerosol decreases weakened heterogeneous radical uptake, enhancing O3 formation (+1.62 ppb). In Phase II, however, the net HET effect reversed sign (−2.86 ppb), driven by shifts in multiple heterogeneous pathways – including changes in radical uptake, HONO and N2O5 chemistry, and aerosol liquid water – rather than radical scavenging alone. Accounting for aerosol effects (AEs = ARI + HET), reductions in PM2.5 and NOx increased O3, while VOCs reductions consistently lowered O3 in both seasons. Under carbon peaking and neutrality scenarios with AEs, winter O3 increased by 6.7 % and 10.7 %, whereas summer O3 decreased by 2.9 % and 6.7 %, highlighting seasonally contrasting responses. These results underscore the necessity of explicitly accounting for multi-path aerosol–O3 interactions in both near-term air quality management and long-term climate mitigation to prevent unintended trade-offs and maximize co-benefits."

This study using unprecedented triple-frequency radar observations for the first time unravels the key snow growth processes over diverse geographies. The unique cross-continental datasets from triple-frequency campaigns shed new insights for model evaluation and future satellite missions. 
 Snow formation is a complex interplay of multiple microphysical growth processes, and the prevailing snow characteristics are inherently linked to local climate. However, the persistent shortage of observations for characterizing snow microphysics at a global scale continues to constrain our understanding of snow growth processes. Here, we investigate snow riming and aggregation signatures in stratiform precipitation through triple-frequency radar observations collected during coordinated field campaigns across Southern China, the Eastern United States, Western Europe, Northern Europe and Antarctica. The results suggest that the velocity-based riming estimates are generally consistent with triple-frequency observations, and the riming frequency increases with temperature. Our analysis of dual-frequency observations in these field campaigns qualitatively indicate the dendritic growth zone around −15 °C playing a key role in initiating enhanced snow size growth, and reveals a generally temperature-dependent snowflake growth characteristics. The snow over Eastern US is characterized by the most prominent riming growth, corresponding to moderate to heavy riming. Triple-frequency signatures of snowflakes over west Europe are consistent with Southern China, while the latter shows a higher degree of riming. The weakest snow growth signatures were found over west Antarctica, potentially owing to the scarcity of ice nucleating particles and available water vapor for deposition. In addition, our statistics reveal a latitudinal dependence for snowfall detection limitations with current spaceborne Ku- and Ka-band radars, and shed novel insights into future triple-frequency satellite missions as well as joint application of weather and spaceborne radars."

Our findings indicated that bacterial viability is significantly influenced by nebulization procedures, and nebulization efficiency varies among different nebulizers. 
 Bioaerosol is a significant element of Particulate Matter (PM) and comprises various components, with bacterial species ranking as some of the most important. Reliable and consistent bioaerosol generators are essential for the investigation of bioaerosol in laboratory environments. Aerosol generators are utilized to evaluate the performance of bioaerosol collectors, explore the transport and deposition of biological particles, and study the health impacts and exposure to airborne microorganisms. The main goal of the bacteria experiments is to have an aerosol generator able to aerosolize the maximum number of viable and culturable cells at elevated particle concentrations. This study performs a comparative investigation of two bioaerosol generators: the Sparging Liquid Aerosol Generator (SLAG) by CH Technologies and the 1520 Flow Focusing Monodisperse Aerosol Generator (FMAG) by TSI. The analysis concentrated on the vitality, culturability, fragmentation, and nebulization efficiency of E. coli cells. The results indicated increased fragmentation using the SLAG nebulizer, and the size distribution varied according to the concentration of the injection fluid for FMAG. Both nebulizers imposed significant stress on bacteria during nebulization, halving their viability. Ultimately, the nebulization efficiency of FMAG is twenty times higher than that of SLAG."

By comparing stroke strength and timing, our new Current Ratio approach reveals flash initiation patterns in different storm types. The method is straightforward and data-driven, enabling physical insight without model-based analysis or prior assumptions, and supports regional lightning analysis and forecasting. 
 Lightning flashes play a key role in the global electrical circuit, serving as markers of deep convection and indicators of climate variability. However, this field of research remains challenging due to the wide range of physical processes and spatiotemporal scales involved.To address this challenge, this study utilizes the Lightning Differential Space (LDS), which maps lightning stroke intervals onto a parameter space defined by their temporal and spatial derivatives.Using data from the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN), we analyze the Number Distribution LDS clustering patterns across specific seasons in three climatically distinct regions: a tropical rainforest region (Amazon), a subtropical marine environment (Eastern Mediterranean Sea), and a mid-latitude continental region (Great Plains in the U.S.). The LDS reveals a robust clustering topography composed of “allowed” and “forbidden” interval ranges, which are consistent across regions, while shifts in cluster position and properties reflect the underlying regional meteorological conditions.As an extension of the LDS framework, we introduce the Current Ratio LDS, a new diagnostic for identifying flash initiation by mapping the ratio of peak currents between successive strokes into the LDS coordinate space. This space reveals a spatiotemporal structure that enables a clearer distinction between local and regional scales. It also reveals a distinct cluster, suggesting a possible teleconnection between remote strokes, spanning tens to hundreds of kilometers.Together, the Number Distribution LDS and the novel Current Ratio LDS provide a scalable, data-driven framework for analyzing and interpreting large datasets of CG lightning activity. This approach strengthens the ability to characterize multiscale lightning behavior, offers a framework for evaluating model representations of stroke and flash processes, and provides a basis for developing diagnostics relevant to operational monitoring and forecasting of lightning activity."

Our study reveals that the plant blooms widely during wet years and is often found near roads and moist areas. The percent cover maps developed using field data, drone images, and machine learning models would help land managers detect and control this invasive species, protecting Northern Great Plains grasslands. 
 Yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam.; MEOF) is an invasive forb pervasive across the Northern Great Plains in the United States, often linked to traits such as wide adaptability, strong stress tolerance, and high productivity. Despite MEOF's prevalent ecological-economic impacts and importance, knowledge of its spatial distribution and temporal evolution is extremely limited. Here, we aim to develop a spatial database of annual MEOF abundance (2016–2023) across western South Dakota (SD) at 10 m spatial resolution by applying a generalized prediction model on Sentinel-2 imagery. We collected in situ quadrat-based total vegetation cover with MEOF percent cover estimates across western SD from 2021 through 2023 and synthesized with other available percent cover estimates (2016–2022) of several federal, state, and non-governmental sources. We conducted drone overflights at 14 sites across Butte County, SD in 2023 to develop very high spatial resolution (4–6 cm) and accurate MEOF cover maps by applying a random forest (RF) classification model. The field-measured and uncrewed aerial system (UAS) derived MEOF percent cover estimates were used to train, test, and validate a RF regression model. The predicted MEOF percent cover dataset was validated with UAS-derived percent cover in 2023 across four sites (out of 14 sites). We found that the variation in the Normalized Difference Moisture Index and Distance to roads were among the top predicting variables in predicting MEOF abundance. Our predictive model yielded greater accuracies with an R2 of 0.76, RMSE of 15.11 %, MAE of 10.95 %, and MAPE of 1.06 %. We further validated our 2023 predicted maps using the 3 m resolution PlanetScope imagery for regions where field samples could not be collected in 2023. The database of MEOF abundance showed consecutive years of average or above-average precipitation yielded a higher MEOF abundance across the study region. The database could assist local land managers and government officials pinpoint locations requiring timely land management to control the rapid spread of MEOF in the Northern Great Plains.

Data collected from this unique and biodiverse habitat includes information on ground flora, soils, forest structure and general site information from 27 major pinewood sites. Questions addressing the threats and changes occurring in the pinewood habitat can now be explored across a 50 year time span for the first time. 
 The native pinewoods of Scotland are acknowledged to be an important ecological resource, both for their biodiversity value and as a cultural and amenity resource. Due to the unique nature of the habitat and its limited range, it plays a critical role as an early warning system for broader environmental issues. In the late 1960s and 70s, increased concern was expressed regarding a decline in the status and management of the pinewoods. In response to the concerns, an ecological monitoring survey was initiated by R.G.H. Bunce of the Nature Conservancy in 1971, recording ground flora, tree information, soils and other descriptive attributes. Since that time, interest in the pinewoods has increased further, and there is a general consensus that the habitat is more vulnerable than ever. Thanks to a recent repeat survey between 2018 and 2022, questions addressing the threats and changes occurring in the pinewoods can now be explored in a statistically robust way. These questions include issues surrounding the impacts of deer grazing, regeneration, the balance between native and exotic species, local disturbances, trends in ground flora species occurrences, climate change and recovery from acidification.

The maps show forest expansion, cropland expansion, and bare land reduction, together with a 30 % decline in mean soil erosion. 
 Unsustainable human activities have driven global ecological degradation. In China, decades of restoration policies have been implemented to reverse this trend in severely degraded regions with catastrophic soil erosion, transforming them into landscapes of ecological recovery. However, the evolution of soil erosion in these regions remains poorly quantified due to the absence of high-resolution, long-term, and high-frequency monitoring data. Here, to address this gap and provide a reliable spatiotemporal benchmark dataset, we conducted the first 10-m quarterly wall-to-wall land change mapping for China's flagship ecological restoration site: the Loess Plateau, based on the developed cross-temporal consistency-constraint deep learning framework. The dataset was generated using over 10 terabytes of Sentinel and Landsat imagery and documents land-cover dynamics across 100 quarterly time steps from 2000 to 2024, showing an overall accuracy of 81.44 % based on 40,000 annotated samples and 79.8 % for third-party validation sources. The resulting maps record pronounced land-cover dynamics, including forest expansion (+13,131 km2), cropland expansion (+28,095 km2), and bare land reduction (-65,029 km2) over the past decades. Furthermore, the produced dataset was combined with environmental factors to measure the 25-year quarter-level soil erosion, where comparison with government survey data shows strong consistency, with a mean absolute error of 4.50 %. The dataset further illustrates that long-term ecological interventions have substantially reduced erosion intensity in the region by 30 % over the past 25 years, from 13.34 to 9.35 t/(hm2·a). Based on this benchmark, the long-term, fine-grained soil erosion becomes possible to estimate. The data-driven analysis indicates that current erosion is most severe in the central and southwestern Loess Plateau, and scenario modeling based on multiple factors suggests that optimized vegetation distribution – including grassland expansion and cropland-to-forest conversion – could potentially reduce future erosion intensity to 6.42 t/(hm2·a). This dataset provides a comprehensive benchmark for erosion mitigation in the Loess Plateau and its underlying drivers, providing critical insights for sustainable land management, ecological restoration, and policy development both in China and across fragile ecosystems worldwide.

Tests against ground stations and other satellites show that the new record exceeds existing products and can support applications such as drought, freeze–thaw, and carbon monitoring. 
 The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission delivers the first multi-angular L-band observations for retrieving global soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD), two critical variables for understanding terrestrial water and carbon cycles. However, the combined effects of non-identical fields of view and aliasing in multi-angular SMOS brightness temperature (TB) observations can introduce noise and biases when the TBs are averaged to a nominal incidence angle, as done in the SMOS L3 dataset, thereby degrading land parameter retrievals. To address this issue, an optimized SMOS TB dataset was initially produced at a fixed 40° incidence angle, consistent with the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. We then developed the first SMOS mono-angular SM and VOD products designed to achieve performance comparable to SMAP and improved relative to conventional multi-angle SMOS retrievals. The 40° TB optimization was performed using the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model, and the inversion relied on the SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX (SMAP-IB) algorithm, yielding a global 40° SMOS TB record and associated SM and VOD products for 2010–2024 at 25 km spatial resolution, collectively referred to as SMOS-IB. Results showed that the optimized 40° TB reached a performance level comparable to SMAP and improved relative to SMOS-L3, both in its sensitivity to in-situ SM from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and in the reduction of global pixel-scale noise. When multiple evaluation metrics are considered, the SMOS-IB SM and VOD data, benefiting from the use of the optimized TB as input and a newly optimized soil roughness (Hr) parameterization, showed improved performance compared with those derived from SMOS L3 40° TB or from the multi-angular SMOS products. The SMOS-IB TB, SM and VOD products can be used for L-band algorithm development and SMAP harmonization, global drought monitoring, and studies of vegetation water and biomass dynamics. SMOS-IB is publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/17647385 (Xing et al., 2025)."

Pillai;Christian Wille;Felix Nieberding;Manuel Helbig;Torsten Sachs,A Year-Long Eddy Covariance Dataset over an Alpine Steppe: A Landscape Perspective on Carbon and Energy Fluxes,"We present a continuous dataset of carbon and energy fluxes measured over an alpine steppe in the Tibetan Plateau using the Eddy Covariance technique at 19 m. Covering a larger footprint (~30 ha) than the existing long-term 3 m measurements, it enables landscape-scale flux estimation, improved alignment with satellite observations, and supports studies of ecosystem modelling and satellite product validation. 
 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is warming rapidly, with future projections suggesting continued warming that may amplify climate–carbon feedbacks. However, sparse in-situ observations and pronounced spatial heterogeneity in vegetation, soil moisture, and climate have limited our understanding of these ecosystem responses. Here, we present a continuous record of carbon and energy fluxes measured at a landscape scale (~30 ha / 0.3 km2) in an alpine steppe ecosystem on the TP from July 2018 to June 2019. Flux measurements were quality-filtered and gap-filled to produce a complete seasonal record using two complementary approaches, marginal distribution sampling (MDS) and random forest (RF). Eddy covariance measurements represent integrated fluxes over their footprint area, which are often much smaller than most model grids or remote sensing pixels, particularly in grassland ecosystems. Owing to the higher measurement height (19 m) at this site, the measurement footprint closely aligns with the spatial resolution of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, facilitating more consistent landscape-scale comparisons. The data include quality flags indicating observed or gap-filled values, uncertainty estimates, footprint diagnostics, and auxiliary meteorological variables. The data described in this manuscript provides a robust foundation for examining carbon–climate interactions in alpine environments, supporting ecosystem modeling and satellite product validation."

These data were harmonized with a crop taxonomy and then linked to other classification systems including agricultural statistics and remotely sensed products. This dataset can support researchers and policy makers in tracking changes over time, calculating crop rotations, for national comparisons, for evaluating official statistics and for remote sensing. 
 As part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU), farmers make annual declarations of the agricultural activities for which they receive subsidies. The declarations include the crops they grow at parcel level, referred to as Geo-Spatial Application (GSA) data. Paying Agencies (PA) of every EU Member State (MS) use specific crop classifications in their native language, and not all provide access to the GSA data. In the past, the EuroCrops initiative harmonized openly available GSA data for a single year (2021) using the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT), but multiple years are available depending on the country. Harmonizing a time series of farmers' crop declarations at parcel level would allow for comparative spatiotemporal analysis across the EU, the development of indicators that can be used for CAP and other policy monitoring purposes, and would provide data for training and validation of remotely sensed products. Here we have collected the GSA crop type declarations and parcel geometries that are publicly available from 18 PAs, the administrative bodies managing GSA data, for a minimum of three years. We have then harmonized the GSA data using HCAT v.4, a new version developed as part of this work. The data set includes nearly 47 million parcels covering 21 Mha. To facilitate integration and interoperability of the GSA data with other EU data sets containing spatial information on crops, we harmonized the crop classes used in the following data sets with HCAT v.4: 1) LUCAS, 2) the Integrated Farm Statistics/Farm Structure Survey, 3) the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), and 4) the classification systems of the Copernicus High Resolution Layer on Crop Types. To demonstrate the potential of the multiannual, harmonised dataset presented in this paper, the GSA data were aggregated to NUTS 2 regions and compared with statistics on crop areas from Eurostat, showing good correspondence for many crops but also highlighting those crops and countries where the agreement is less good, providing possible reasons why. The data can also be used for mapping crop rotations, and a map showing maize monoculture illustrates this application. Farmers' declarations will increasingly become available as MS are required to publish these under the High-Value Dataset regulation. The EuroCrops v2.0 data set is registered and publicly available under the DOI https://doi.org/10.2905/b9fb9e67-78a9-4327-9d59-39a928d812d3."

Results show that model resolution and wave forcing, through both the Stokes-Coriolis force and Stokes drift, play a key role in shaping ocean circulation, seasonal energy budgets, and floating debris trajectories. High-resolution currents and wave forcing, especially during monsoons, increase the anisotropic spread and travel distances of drifting material. 
 The Indian Ocean basin faces significant anthropogenic pressure due to its connection to over 2.2 billion people through river basins. Indian Ocean dynamics are characterized by strong regional and seasonal variability driven by the monsoon system and intense eddy activity. To support future studies on land-sea transfers and marine debris dispersion in this complex ocean, we developed a new circulation modeling configuration using the hydrodynamic model SYMPHONIE. Our configuration introduces a unique telescopic grid covering the entire basin, enabling the study of sub-basin connectivity while resolving meso and submesoscale processes in the coastal region, from the Mozambique Channel to the Bay of Bengal, at a resolution of 1 to 3 km. Additionally, we integrate the recently released high-resolution GloFAS river discharge dataset to force the physical simulations with daily freshwater inputs. Three annual experiments are conducted, exploring the effects of wave forcing and spatial resolution. The reference simulation (IndOc.HR) uses high resolution without wave forcing, IndOc.HR-Sto uses the same resolution but includes wave forcing through both the Stokes-Coriolis force and the Stokes drift, and IndOc.12 is a lower-resolution simulation without wave forcing. Comparisons of temperature, salinity and sea level with in situ and satellite data show the good performance of the simulations and the ability of the high resolution model to accurately capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface dynamics and water masses over the Indian Ocean. We further analyze energy budgets and perform Lagrangian experiments to illustrate the critical role of resolution and waves in shaping the circulation and the resulting marine debris dispersion patterns. The effect of energy levels is particularly significant on trajectory statistics such as average travel distances and preferred spread direction. Notably, Stokes drift has a significant seasonal effect in the Arabian Sea during the southwest monsoon, while current field resolution strongly influences trajectories in the Mozambique Channel. Our results provide a robust modeling framework for studying Indian Ocean dynamics and exploring their effect on marine connectivity and the transport of matter, including pollutants, larvae or organic matter."

Bowman;Hong Zhang,Implementing riverine biogeochemical inputs in ECCO-Darwin: a sensitivity analysis of terrestrial fluxes in a data-assimilative global ocean biogeochemistry model,"Accounting for carbon and nutrients in rivers is essential for resolving carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere. In this study, we add the effect of present-day rivers to a pioneering global-ocean biogeochemistry model. This study highlights the challenge for global ocean numerical models to cover the complexity of the flow of water and carbon across the Land-to-Ocean Aquatic Continuum. 
 Terrestrial sources of carbon and nutrients drive biogeochemical cycles in coastal regions and in the global ocean. Quantifying their impact on the spatiotemporal variability of the ocean carbon cycle is pivotal to understanding the distinctive characteristics of ocean basins dominated by riverine inflow. ECCO-Darwin is a data-constrained, global-ocean biogeochemistry model that has heretofore lacked lateral inputs of carbon and nutrients. The objective of this study is to add this new capability to ECCO-Darwin and to carry out a suite of sensitivity experiments in order to quantify the impact of these lateral fluxes on coastal- and open-ocean biogeochemistry. In this work, we use an optimized version of the data-assimilative global-ocean biogeochemistry ECCO-Darwin model to perform a sensitivity analysis of the ocean to lateral inputs of carbon and nutrients. We generate riverine inputs by combining daily point-source freshwater discharge from JRA55-do with the Global NEWS 2 watershed model, accounting for lateral inputs from 5171 watersheds worldwide. The addition of riverine inputs drives a small CO2 outgassing (+0.02 Pg C yr−1) due to compensating processes at regional scales. In basins dominated by carbon runoff, such as the Tropical Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, the addition of riverine inputs increases CO2 outgassing (+13 % and +9 %, respectively). In contrast, runoff in nutrient-dominated Southeast Asia leads to increased CO2 uptake (+9 %). This new riverine biogeochemical input capability will enable future ECCO-Darwin solutions to better capture key processes that occur along coastal margins in global oceans."

The model captured fine-scale air motions over complex terrain and coastal regions at large-eddy scales with comprehensive global modeling configuration, enabled by scale-aware turbulence parameterization. Performance tests demonstrated that graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration make such high-resolution simulations feasible within practical timeframes. 
 Pushing global climate models to large-eddy simulation (LES) scales over complex terrain has remained a major challenge. This study presents the first known implementation of a global model – SCREAM (Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model) – at 100 m horizontal resolution using a regionally refined mesh (RRM) over the San Francisco Bay Area. Two hindcast simulations were conducted to test performance under both strong synoptic forcing and weak, boundary-layer-driven conditions. We demonstrate that SCREAM can stably run at LES scales while realistically capturing topography, surface heterogeneity, and coastal processes. The 100 m SCREAM-RRM substantially improves near-surface wind speed, temperature, humidity, and pressure biases compared to the baseline 3.25 km simulation, and better reproduces fine-scale wind oscillations and boundary-layer structures. These advances leverage SCREAM's scale-aware SHOC turbulence parameterization, which transitions smoothly across scales without tuning. Performance tests show that while CPU-only simulations remain costly, GPU acceleration with SCREAMv1 on NERSC's Perlmutter system enables two-day hindcasts to complete in under two wall-clock days. Our results open the door to LES-scale studies of orographic flows, boundary-layer turbulence, and coastal clouds within a fully comprehensive global modeling framework."

Anoxic batch microcosm incubations were constructed containing Wyoming MX80 bentonite (a candidate buffer material in geological disposal) and artificial groundwater with or without steel coupons to represent canister materials. Se(VI)(aq) bioreduced and was removed by 7 days when lactate was added as an electron donor, after which sulfate reduction occurred. With H2 gas as the electron donor, Se(VI) bioreduction slowed, with complete removal at 14 days and minimal sulfate reduction thereafter. 16S rRNA gene sequencing highlighted the dominance of Anaerobacillus spp. (44% at 28 days) during Se(VI)-reduction, and in the lactate-amended systems, there was a subsequent enrichment in sulfate-reducing bacteria affiliated with Desulfosporosinus spp. (60% relative abundance at 84 days). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses identified monoclinic Se(0) as the bioreduction product after 28 days, but by 84 days this evolved to trigonal Se(0) in the absence of steel coupons or was further reduced to FeSe2 with steel present. The reduction of Se(VI)(aq) to poorly soluble Se(0)/FeSe2 mediated by indigenous bentonite microbial communities highlights their potential importance in promoting Se-79 retention during deep geological disposal."

This study systematically analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of ozone pollution during heatwaves and its compound impacts on health and crops using national ozone monitoring data from 2015 to 2024 and the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. Results demonstrate substantial ozone concentration increases in the Fenwei Plain (FP), Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region, Sichuan Basin (SB), Yangtze River Middle Reaches Urban Agglomerations (YRMRU), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (with a slight decrease in the Pearl River Delta (PRD)). In the SB, YRD, YRMRU, BTH, and PRD, the average annual growth rate of nighttime average ozone concentration (NTAvg) exceeds that of daytime average ozone concentration (DTAvg), while the opposite pattern is observed in the FP. Nationwide ozone exposure caused total yield losses of 5.84 million tons for wheat, rice, and maize, with associated economic losses approximating USD 2.98 billion. During concurrent heatwave and ozone exceedance events, the highest population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for three major disease categories were observed in BTH, Shanxi, and Shandong (PAF > 2%). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop coordinated air quality improvement strategies that address both heatwaves and ozone pollution."

This study presents a detailed assessment of their representation across three generations of global reanalysis products (ERA5, ERA‐Interim, and ERA40) from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts, paired with a hierarchy of simulations at different grid resolutions with the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). Using the high‐resolution (2.5‐km resolution) Copernicus Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA) as a benchmark, we find that the global reanalysis data sets systematically underestimate wind speeds (around 30% in ERA5 and 50% in ERA‐Interim and ERA40) and fail to capture key structural features of these regional storms. Similar deficiencies are observed in CESM2 simulations when using standard latitude‐longitude grids at 1–2° ${}^{\circ}$ horizontal resolutions, which is a common model configuration used in recent iterations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects. Variable‐resolution configurations in CESM2 with enhanced representation of the Greenland topography demonstrate a marked improvement in capturing the strength and structure of these regional storms. Sensitivity simulations further confirm that steeper ice‐sheet margins (better resolved at higher spatial resolution) are crucial for accurately representing katabatic acceleration. These findings underscore the importance of spatial resolution and realistic topographic representation in simulating local climate extremes. Accurately capturing such events is vital not only for understanding modern climate dynamics on and around the polar ice sheets, but likely also for simulating realistic ice sheet/Earth system interactions in glacial climates of the past."

Logan, the second highest peak in North America located in the St. Elias mountains in southwest Yukon, Canada, have provided conflicting accumulation records, thus the hydroclimate response to changing atmospheric conditions in the highest elevation regions is not well constrained. Here, we present the accumulation record from the new 325 m Mt. Logan ice core drilled at 5,334 m asl on the summit plateau in May 2022. Multi‐parameter annual layer counting, confirmed with radionuclide and volcanic tephra measurements, extends to 1911 CE, associated with a depth of 257 m. The thinning‐corrected annual accumulation record reveals an average rate of 3.0 m water equivalent per year (m weq a−1) from 1912 to 2020 CE, greater than six times higher than the previous estimate of ∼0.41 m weq a−1 from the 2002 Mt. Logan Prospector Russell Col core. Correlation analysis between the annual accumulation record and regional climate data sets (e.g., Japanese 55‐year Reanalysis, weather stations) reveal a strong positive relationship with warm‐season total precipitable water and temperature. Thus, we suggest interdecadal precipitation variability on Mt. Logan is at least partially driven by warm‐season atmospheric water vapor loading, potentially related to atmospheric temperature responses associated with the warm‐season Alaska Blocking Index. Further, the record reveals a statistically significant increase in accumulation of 0.13 m weq per decade since 1970. These results reveal a drastically different Mt. Logan ice core record and provide a new warm‐season perspective on drivers of high‐elevation accumulation variability in the North Pacific."

It manifests pronounced spatial heterogeneity when these jet centers experience asynchronous variations. However, previous researches about this heterogeneity are still limited. This study examines the long‐term variability of the spatial heterogeneity of SWJ during boreal summer (July–August) over recent 40 years, particular for the decadal changes. Three centers with high wind speed along SWJ, respectively located over Atlantic, West Asia and East Asia (short for ATJ, WAJ and EAJ) exhibit marked spatial heterogeneity in their temporal evolution. Both of ATJ and WAJ demonstrate the equatorward shifts, while EAJ shows poleward shift. This zonal heterogeneity is particularly pronounced on the decadal time scale, with all three centers have phase transitions in their meridional displacements around 1998. The decadal changes in the atmospheric circulation before and after 1998 encompass the circulation anomalies caused by the individual meridional displacements of the three jet centers. Meanwhile, the combined circulation anomalies caused by these jet centers closely match the decadal change of the atmospheric circulation. This provides compelling evidence for a strong dynamical connection between the atmospheric circulation and the heterogeneous variation of SWJ. The phase transitions of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, combined with the rapid retreat of Arctic sea ice, influence the decadal changes in the spatial heterogeneity of SWJ by modulating the meridional temperature gradient."

Chemical transport models and emission inventories are widely used to study the emission, transport, and chemical transformation of NH3. However, traditional static inventories consider emissions as unidirectional, overlooking interactions between NH3 emissions and other ecosystems, especially land surface processes linked to emissions. In this study, we achieved bidirectional NH3 exchange between land surface and atmospheric chemistry models by developing WRF‐CN‐Chem, a model integrating the Noah‐MP land surface model with carbon‐nitrogen dynamics (Noah‐MP‐CN) and the Weather Research and Forecasting model with atmospheric chemistry (WRF‐Chem). Compared with the static Multi‐resolution Emission Inventory for China, the dynamic bidirectional model exhibits higher spatiotemporal resolution and demonstrated a stronger temporal correlation with satellite observations. WRF‐CN‐Chem model estimated 7.88 TgN NH3 emission in year 2020 in eastern China. Additionally, we incorporated the atmospheric nitrogen deposition, simulated by the “Online” experiment, into the soil ammonium pool. Our findings revealed an increase of 2.25 TgC yr−1 in land net primary productivity (NPP) in eastern China attributable to the increased nitrogen deposition. By incorporating bidirectional NH3 exchange between land surface and atmosphere chemistry models, this study enhances the simulation of dynamic ammonia emissions and improves understanding of atmospheric nitrogen deposition processes. Furthermore, linking these processes to land NPP provides valuable insights for sustainable land management and pollution mitigation strategies, helping address the environmental impacts of excessive fertilization."

Response of O3 to CHWD is complicated by the vegetation‐atmosphere feedbacks through influencing biogenic emissions and stomatal deposition. Here, we employed a regional meteorology‐chemistry‐vegetation coupled model, integrated with optimized drought emission algorithm and interactive dry deposition scheme, to investigate the vegetation‐atmosphere feedbacks and their effects on O3 pollution during CHWD. Analysis shows that CHWD have intensified in the northern hemisphere, with more frequent occurrence, stronger intensity and longer duration compared to the average climatology. Unusually elevated O3 levels and exceedance frequency by more than 20% compared to normal conditions were observed during CHWD in the United States, western Europe and China. Model results indicate that heatwaves and droughts jointly lead to 10%–24% increase of summertime biogenic volatile organic compound emissions in vegetated regions, except in the severely drought‐affected areas. Furthermore, extremely hot and dry conditions induce stomatal closure and suppress plant growth, inhibiting O3 stomatal removal by water‐stressed vegetation. It is estimated that such intricate vegetation‐atmosphere feedbacks substantially exacerbate O3 pollution during CHWD, with equal importance to that of increased photochemical rates. Our findings offer a novel perspective on the interactions between climate, vegetation, and chemistry regarding compound extreme weather events."

The ΩHCHO product is assessed using 36 ground‐based Pandora direct‐sun measurements from Pandonia Global Network (PGN) as a reference data set. The 36 PGN sites were chosen for consistency in direct‐sun and sky‐scan measurement modes. In the first year of operation (Aug 2023–Sep 2024), TEMPO ΩHCHO exhibits moderate to strong agreement at PGN sites in both measurement modes (R2 = 0.63 to 0.85). TEMPO shows a negligible bias of −2 ± 20% at lower ΩHCHO (<1.0 × 1016 molecule cm−2) and a larger underestimation of −22 ± 5% at higher ΩHCHO (>1.5 × 1016 molecule cm−2). TEMPO clearly captures the seasonal variability of ΩHCHO, with summer values being greatest and winter, spring, and fall values being lower by − 62%, − 45%, and − 29%, respectively. TEMPO shows no consistent bias at any time of day with excellent agreement with Pandora for different meteorological conditions. For all hourly differences between TEMPO and Pandora, 96% fall within 1 × 1016 molecules cm−2. TEMPO provides almost 50% more days with at least one observation compared to observations taken only at 1 p.m., from typical polar‐orbiting satellites. These findings confirm the high quality of TEMPO's ΩHCHO measurements under a wide variety of conditions and show great promise for future scientific applications."

A simple falling‐snow deposition model is often needed for hydrological, climatic, and land surface studies. Here, we use the Large Eddy Simulation Model S‐ARPS (Snow Advanced Regional Prediction System) to simulate falling‐snow deposition over single three‐dimensional (3D) hills with different obstacle Reynolds numbers, and over a real complex terrain area at Namtso under different wind conditions. An EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Function) method is applied to the LES data to establish a simple prediction model for snow deposition. For single 3D hills, the accuracy of the EOF‐based falling‐snow deposition model reaches as high as 78%, and for the Namtso terrain 80%. The EOF‐based model presented in this study is mathematically simple and practically easy to implement in comparison to machine‐learning and large‐eddy simulation models for application to climatic and hydrological studies, which universality can be expanded with further vorticity to spatial mode studies."

To address this challenge, this work presents an integrated methodology for PM2.5 source apportionment in Bhopal, central India, combining dispersion‐normalized positive matrix factorization (DN‐PMF) with a machine‐learning interpretability approach using Random Forest and SHAP (RF‐SHAP). DN‐PMF improves conventional source identification by incorporating air dilution effects, yielding refined source contributions for nine factors in Bhopal. Seasonal factor contributions peaked during periods with a lower boundary layer height, such as secondary sulfate during the winter season (21.3 μg m−3, 31.7%). The COVID‐19 lockdowns, a quasi‐natural emissions reduction experiment, led to a decrease in aerosol contributions from industrial, residential and traffic‐related sources. However, during this period, crop residue burning was exposed as a major anthropogenic contributor, which together with unfavorable meteorology resulted in increased mean PM2.5 (50.6 ± 24.3 μg m−3) during the lockdowns compared to the reference period (36.7 ± 9.7 μg m−3). Using RF‐SHAP the influence of meteorology and emission sources in driving secondary inorganic aerosol formation was examined. Secondary nitrate and residential fuel were identified as key contributors to exceedances of the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standards (60 μg m−3, 24‐hr average) at the study site. Integrating DN‐PMF with RF‐SHAP (driver analysis) enhanced source attribution by linking source contributions with their driving factors, establishing a framework for assessing pollution dynamics. This framework can help strengthen improved air quality initiatives in India, including the national Smart Cities Mission."

However, the overlooking of surface water flow in the land surface models (LSMs) leads to the defect of flood simulation and prediction. In this study, a quasi‐3D LSM, incorporated with the overland flow, has been driven by downscaled numerical weather prediction (NWP) to establish a high‐resolution flood prediction system. Compared to the Sentinel‐1 imagery, the quasi‐3D LSM reasonably depicts the distributions of deluged regions and surface runoff for an unprecedented flood event over North China in July‐August 2023. The surface lateral flow redistributes soil moisture, resulting in wetter valleys and drier ridgelines. In addition, the results show that the downscaled precipitation prediction is skillful at a lead time of 3.5 days, while the reliable flood prediction can be expected with a lead time of up to 6 days, especially in low‐lying regions. Our work highlights that reliable flood prediction can be achieved through integrating the high‐resolution quasi‐3D LSM and the NWP, which is crucial for disaster prevention and reduction."

 Gene expression is dynamically regulated by gene regulatory networks comprising multiple regulatory components to mediate cellular functions1. An ideal tool for analyzing these processes would track multiple-component dynamics with both spatiotemporal resolution and scalability within the same cells, a capability not yet achieved. Here, we present CytoTape, a genetically encoded, modular protein tape recorder for multiplexed and spatiotemporally scalable recording of gene regulation dynamics continuously for up to three weeks, physiologically compatible, with single-cell, minutes-scale resolution. CytoTape employs a flexible, thread-like, elongating intracellular protein self-assembly engineered via computationally assisted rational design, built on earlier XRI technology2. We demonstrated its utility across multiple mammalian cell types, achieving simultaneous recording of five transcription factor activities and gene transcriptional activities. CytoTape reveals that divergent transcriptional trajectories correlate with transcriptional history and signal integration, and that distinct immediate early genes (IEGs) exhibit complex temporal correlations within single cells. We further extended CytoTape into CytoTape-vivo for scalable, spatiotemporally resolved single-cell recording in the living brain, enabling simultaneous weeks-long recording of doxycycline- and IEG promoter-dependent gene expression histories across up to 14,123 neurons spanning multiple brain regions per mouse. Together, the CytoTape toolkit establishes a versatile platform for scalable and multiplexed analysis of cell physiological processes in vitro and in vivo."

Subsequent microseismicity revealed a cryptic fluid phase facilitated magma intrusion, highlighting that cascading processes are potentially essential for eruption initiations. 
 Spatiotemporal correlations between moderate-to-large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions indicate that earthquake-induced stress changes can trigger eruptions. Triggering is rarely instantaneous, with time-dependent processes inferred to mediate magma ascent to the surface, such as fracture propagation or fluid pressurization. While various processes have been proposed, observational constraints on the specific triggering mechanisms remain limited. Here we integrate an earthquake catalogue, generated by machine-learning and template-matching techniques to enhance microseismicity detections, with geodetic data to show that seismic triggering of the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra Volcano, Galápagos Islands, was facilitated by a cryptic phase of fluid activity. Following 13 years of near-continuous magmatic inflation, totalling > 6.5 m, stress changes induced by a moment magnitude 5.4 intra-caldera earthquake on 26 June 2018 did not immediately trigger magma release from the pressurized magma reservoir. Instead, long-period earthquake swarms revealed post-seismic fluid activity along reservoir-bounding faults in the northwestern caldera, locally promoting edifice failure and facilitating magma intrusion that initiated 8 hours later. These observations demonstrate that even when a pressurized reservoir experiences significant stress perturbation, cascading processes could potentially be essential to initiate volcanic eruptions.

Subsequent microseismicity revealed a cryptic fluid phase facilitated magma intrusion, highlighting that cascading processes are potentially essential for eruption initiations."

 Carbon sequestration in shale gas operations represents a crucial pathway to achieve Geological Negative Emissions, which is essential for global 1.5 °C targets. However, the emissions reduction potential and economic viability of this approach in China’s shale gas value chain remain unclear. This study quantifies the potential for transforming China’s shale gas value chain from an emission source to a carbon sink, while revealing spatial heterogeneity in economic feasibility. Results demonstrate that synergistic deployment of CO2-based technologies can achieve Geological Negative Emissions across the value chain, with national carbon sink potential reaching 66 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalents and shale gas production increasing by 4,518 billion cubic meters. Multi-scenario economic assessments reveal that marine shale in the Sichuan Basin exhibits inherent profitability, whereas continental reservoirs require carbon credit integration or optimized production. Current Chinese carbon market prices provide insufficient incentives, implementing region-specific subsidies and enhancing carbon pricing frameworks could unlock this potential, thereby contributing to national carbon neutrality goals and multiple Sustainable Development Goals.

However, it is suggested that cooperation is needed between developed and developing nations to ensure that disparities in air pollution are not perpetuated in the future. 
 Climate action ameliorates public health by reducing hazardous air pollutants alongside greenhouse gases, yet misguided mitigation efforts could induce imbalances in air pollution exchange across international borders. Despite its potential to endanger equality, the effects from climate action on transboundary air pollution are relatively unstudied. Here we show that stricter mitigation increases the fraction of co-benefits that originate externally in Africa by +8% in shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) towards sustainability (SSP1) and by +53% for fragmentation (SSP3). The fraction of externally originating co-benefits is greater in developing countries (0.76 in SSP1-26) than developed (0.65), indicating that developing countries are more dependent on external action. Although co-benefits are maximized in the most ambitious scenario, SSP1-19 (1.32 million deaths avoided), their transboundary exchange between countries varies. These results suggest a need for climate policies that consider how inequalities in transboundary air pollution evolve across distinct socioeconomic trends and mitigation strategies in addition to total co-benefit estimates. Climate action could avoid over 1 million deaths globally from air pollution in 2040.

Here, authors develop a smart DNA origami nanodevice that can precisely sense and metabolize high levels of extracellular ATP, thereby fine-tuning purinergic signalling and immune homeostasis. 
 Purinergic signaling dysregulation (e.g., excessive extracellular ATP, exATP) plays a critical role in the pathology of inflammatory disorders, but current efforts in drug development for blocking purinergic receptors are unsatisfactory. Here, inspired by natural metabolite sensing/signaling system, we develop a DNA origami-based ATP-sensing nanodevice (ND) for fine-tuning purinergic signaling and immune homeostasis. This ND composes a tubular DNA origami equipped with ATP sensors and the catalytic subunits (ENPP1-CD73 pairs), which can sense high levels of exATP and then expose the catalytic subunits for metabolizing exATP to adenosine, thereby driving an immune switch from exATP-mediated proinflammatory signals to adenosine-mediated immunosuppressive signals. Further surface displaying of ND on the monocytes (ND@Monos) enables its active inflamed site-targeting to restore immunometabolic hemostasis and reduce inflammation in diverse models in vivo. This study highlights that design of metabolite-sensing NDs is a promising strategy for controlling the homeostasis of cell metabolism and the immune response.

 Perovskite-type tantalum-based oxynitride photocatalysts are promising candidates for water splitting due to their suitable band positions and extended light absorption beyond 600 nm. However, their associated photocatalytic activities and quantum yields remain relatively low. Here, we show that a nano-sized single-crystalline BaxSr1-xTaO2N solid-solution perovskite photocatalyst exhibits state-of-the-art activity in separate oxygen and hydrogen evolution half-reactions. The improved performance is attributed to the nanoscale particle sizes, as well as the reduced defect densities achieved by using a mixed precursor comprising TaS2 and Ta3N5. The half-reaction activities can be modulated by applying a post-synthetic high-temperature treatment. Assessments of charge carrier dynamics, in conjunction with a mechanistic kinetic model, reveal that exponential-tail trap states are formed during this post-treatment. Such trap states, present on the photocatalyst surface, facilitate participation of holes during the oxygen evolution reaction. The development of such solid-solution photocatalysts broadens the range of potential materials for solar-driven hydrogen production. In addition, the present findings are expected to enable the selective tuning of bifunctional photocatalysts for either the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reaction.

 Renewable energy is critical for addressing global climate change, and accurate assessments of its potential are key for decision making and planning. This study provides a detailed, farm-level evaluation of offshore wind power potential in China, incorporating realistic turbine layouts derived from remote sensing data, wake loss modeling, and future climate scenarios. Our findings show that accounting for the farm-level details results in a China’s offshore wind potential of 2.5–4.2 PWh yr−1 which is significantly lower than previous estimates, which often exceeded 5.6 PWh yr−1. Through modeling the wake loss effects within wind farms, the study reveals that wake losses are higher than previously assumed in earlier research. Additionally, the study highlights substantial economic and technical disparities between nearshore bottom-fixed and deep-water floating wind farms, with the latter offering higher potential density but at greater costs. Our results provide a more realistic foundation for setting energy targets, optimizing regional strategies, and promoting floating wind technologies to harness deep-water resources, thereby supporting China’s transition to a sustainable energy future.

Indeed, the detrimental effects of high-energy uncontrolled excitations can only be cured at some specific tuning points in general. Achieving an energy gap is a natural way to extend decoherence countermeasures over a finite region of parameter space. This would be particularly useful in view of the recent efforts to build superconducting topological chains in a top-down approach. In this work, we demonstrate a large energy gap by spatially modulating the local potential of a suspended carbon nanotube, exploiting an analogy with condensed matter systems. This gap is homogeneous on the nanotube and tunable by about two orders of magnitude, bringing the electronic system from an insulating state to a near-metallic state at low temperatures. Energy gaps can be induced by spatial modulation of the electronic potential. Here, the authors demonstrate a large and robust energy gap in a free-standing carbon nanotube utilizing a 15-gate keyboard that spatially modulates the local potential."

A global dataset now maps global heating and cooling degree days, finding future hotspots, rising cooling demand and early shifts in energy needs with major global impacts. 
 Accurate projections of heating and cooling demands are crucial for advancing towards the sustainable development goals. Here we present a global dataset of heating degree days (HDDs) and cooling degree days (CDDs) for 3 levels of global mean temperature rise above pre-industrial conditions—1.0 °C (2006–2016), 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C—regardless of the pathways leading to these warming scenarios. The dataset comprises 30 gridded maps (0.883° × 0.556° resolution) characterizing climate variability through 5 statistical metrics per variable and scenario over a representative 10-year period. The dataset reveals a widespread decline in HDDs and a pronounced, nonlinear increase in CDDs, with the most significant shifts in climate intensity and adaptation needs emerging early in the warming trajectory. Furthermore, using the ‘middle-of-the-road’ Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 as a reference, the dataset indicates that the population experiencing extreme heat conditions (exceeding 3,000 CDDs) is projected to nearly double if the 2.0 °C threshold is reached, increasing from 23% (1.54 billion people) in 2010 to 41% (3.79 billion) by 2050, with the largest projected populations affected in India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Philippines. This HDD–CDD dataset provides a robust foundation for integrating climate information into sustainability planning and development policy. Accurate projections of heating and cooling needs are vital for planning energy use and achieving the sustainable development goals. A global dataset now maps global heating and cooling degree days, finding future hotspots, rising cooling demand and early shifts in energy needs with major global impacts."

 Artificial intelligence has improved the accuracy and efficiency of weather forecasting, surpassing traditional numerical weather prediction models. However, the coarse spatial resolution of global weather forecasting systems limits their ability to capture fine-scale surface heterogeneity and localized extremes, particularly in regions with complex terrain or urban heat island effects. Here, we introduce SR-Weather, a deep learning-based super-resolution framework that converts coarse 0.25° forecasts into 1-km surface air temperature fields using MODIS-derived temperature targets and high-resolution auxiliary inputs. SR-Weather outperforms existing super-resolution methods by explicitly incorporating spatial context, such as topography, impervious surface fraction, and seasonal climatology maps of air temperature. When SR-Weather was applied to the FuXi global weather forecast, the 7-day forecast error in South Korea decreased by more than 20%, which was comparable to the 1-day forecast error from low-resolution prediction using simple spatial interpolation. In addition, SR-Weather effectively reconstructs missing pixels in MODIS-derived air temperature maps under heavy cloud contamination by leveraging auxiliary variables and climatologically smoothed fields. Although validated over South Korea, the framework relies on globally available MODIS products and minimal auxiliary inputs, making it feasible to retrain for other regions. These results indicate that SR-Weather is a scalable and high-fidelity tool for enhancing machine learning-based weather forecasts at fine spatial scales."

 Seismic anisotropy in the Earth’s lower mantle, particularly around subduction zones, is commonly attributed to deformation by dislocation creep, yet much of the lower mantle appears nearly isotropic. This contrast complicates interpretations of mantle rheology. Here we report the temperature dependence of lattice preferred orientation in bridgmanite, the most abundant lower mantle mineral, through high-pressure deformation experiments at 25 gigapascals and 1700–2100 kelvin. Both iron-free and iron-bearing bridgmanite develop lattice preferred orientations across this temperature range, with distinct slip systems occurring below and above 1800 kelvin. Low-temperature fabric produces strong seismic anisotropy, whereas high-temperature fabric yields weak, near-isotropic signatures under horizontal shearing. These results provide a unified explanation for strong seismic anisotropy near subduction zones and globally near-isotropic behavior of the lower mantle. They suggest that dislocation creep could dominate lower mantle deformation while generating diverse seismic signatures, providing important understanding for lower mantle rheology and dynamics. Regional and global seismological observations in the uppermost lower mantle are best explained by the temperature-dependent lattice preferred orientation of bridgmanite, indicating that dislocation creep likely dominates deformation in this area, according to high- pressure and temperature analysis."

 Forest fire smoke significantly disrupts regional carbon cycles and degrades air quality, highlighting an urgent need for highly sensitive detection and inversion models to improve early warning systems. This study proposes a physics-based remote sensing framework for smoke detection and concentration inversion, founded on scattering–absorption theory. By employing multi-dimensional spectral point cluster analysis based on a smoke scattering–absorption model, we introduce the Mahalanobis Distance (MD) as a physically interpretable measure of spectral deviation. A physical relationship between MD and smoke concentration is derived, which serves as the foundation for a dual-threshold detection algorithm and an inversion model. The proposed approach is validated through laboratory experiments, UAV-based simulations, and satellite observations. Key findings include: (1) Smoke clusters migrate quasi-linearly from background to the ideal smoke point with increasing concentration, while their spatial extent contracts exponentially; (2) MD exhibits a double-exponential correlation with smoke concentration (RMSE = 0.18 g/m2, R2 = 0.80); (3) Detection accuracy reaches 0.89–0.97 (UAV) and 0.93 (satellite), with fire localization errors of 0.52 ± 0.35 m and 45.47 ± 42.22 m, respectively. These results confirm that spectral variation is a core parameter for smoke retrieval, and MD provides a robust, physically grounded measure for detection and inversion. The proposed model overcomes key limitations of empirical threshold methods and offers a scalable solution for early forest fire monitoring across platforms."
