10.1088/1748-9326/adde72,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了陆地蒸散发产生的水汽对大气辐射的影响，特别是对地表长波辐射的贡献。论文使用地球系统模型模拟和辐射传输计算，量化了陆地和海洋来源的水汽分布及其对大气辐射平衡的影响。虽然论文没有直接提及特定的遥感技术或卫星观测，但它与大气成分分析密切相关，因为水汽是重要的温室气体，其分布和变化直接影响气候系统。因此，该研究对于理解气候变化和改进气候模型具有重要意义，而这些模型通常会用到遥感数据进行验证和改进。,"['water vapor', 'evapotranspiration', 'radiative effects', 'greenhouse effect', 'Earth system model', 'radiative transfer', 'longwave radiation', 'atmospheric composition']",M M Lague;G R Quetin;K B Heyblom,The radiative effects of water vapour from terrestrial evapotranspiration,"Water vapour accounts for roughly 50% of the modern greenhouse effect. Over continental regions, evapotranspiration (ET) is often limited by water availability. In this study, we spatially quantify how much of the total atmospheric water vapour evaporated most recently from land and calculate the relative contribution of that water vapour to the atmospheric radiative budget. Using a combination of tracer-enabled Earth system model simulations and radiative transfer calculations, we are able to explicitly quantify the 3D distribution of terrestrial vs. oceanic water vapour, and the spatial contribution of each to the surface and top of atmosphere radiative budgets. We find that over many continental regions, more than half of the total column-integrated water vapour originates from land ET, and that this vapour contributes up to 30 W m−2 of longwave radiation into the surface in the annual mean (about 10% of the total). Understanding how terrestrial ET impacts the base-state of water vapour distribution and the water vapour greenhouse effect is critical to understanding how and where changes in terrestrial ET, driven by climate change, land use, etc, will modify the radiative properties of the atmosphere and thus the climate system."

Conventional approaches in estuarine flood mitigation have involved building and heightening hard-engineering structures. Recent evidence from small- to medium-sized estuaries highlights that managed realignment (MR)—relocating flood defences landward—is potentially more sustainable. However, the effectiveness of such MR on estuary-scale flood hazard reduction in large, urbanised estuaries where space for large-scale MR is limited remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we applied a calibrated 2D hydrodynamic simulation of the large (120 km2) urban Clyde estuary on Scotland’s west coast and compared it with existing simulations from eight other UK estuaries of varying size. Our simulations of varying MR sizes (0.15–3.3 km2) along the Clyde resulted in minimal estuary-scale reductions in peak water levels, flood extent, and tidal prism volume. In contrast, similar realignment measures applied to much smaller UK estuaries (3–108 km2) yielded more significant estuary-scale flood attenuation. Our results show that MR exhibits scale-dependent behaviour: the effectiveness of estuary-scale flood risk reduction is proportional to the size of MR relative to estuary size. Larger estuaries require significantly more realignment space to achieve meaningful estuary-scale flood hazard reduction. Conversely, smaller estuaries achieve flood hazard reduction benefits with comparatively smaller interventions as they are more sensitive to geometric changes. The scale-dependent behaviour identified here requires consideration when designing tidal flood risk alleviation strategies for estuaries around the globe, particularly where existing land uses and plans in highly urbanised estuaries may limit available space and/or increase the cost of realignment. Moreover, it also provides evidence that avoiding buildings (re)-development in the tidal floodplains of large estuaries is the best means of minimising future flood risk in a rapidly warming world."

In Bolivia, it is particularly important for mitigating drought impacts and sustaining municipal supply. Yet national planning still lacks a clear picture of how groundwater recharge is changing. This study maps potential groundwater recharge change for all 338 municipalities from 1983 to 2022 and presents a policy-oriented risk indicator. Monthly precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (R) were obtained from TerraClimate (≈4 km) and FLDAS (≈10 km). A water-balance model converted these variables to potential groundwater recharge. Mann–Kendall and Theil–Sen statistics quantified long-term trends, and Pettitt’s test located years of abrupt change. The Annual Reduction of Potential Groundwater Recharge (RAPReHS) was derived to classify each municipality into one of five risk levels based on long-term groundwater recharge trends. Negative trends are significant in 65% of municipalities, and 71% record at least one breakpoint, most often between 2012 and 2015. Santa Cruz shows the steepest mean decline (–1.9 mm yr−1), yet similar losses occur along the Chapare–Yungas corridor of La Paz and Cochabamba, the southern lowlands of Beni, and the Chaco of Tarija. By contrast, Pando and parts of northern Beni retain near-neutral or slightly positive slopes, highlighting strong hydro-climatic heterogeneity. Spatial comparison between RAPReHS results and, deforestation and fire statistics reveals strong alignment. Municipalities in the ‘high’ and ‘severe’ classes spatially overlap with the main zones of primary forest loss recorded in Bolivia between 2000 and 2022. The RAPReHS framework, therefore, provides a reproducible, policy-ready lens through which to track groundwater as land-use pressures and climate variability intensify."

While traditional budgets at the reach- and sub-basin-scale have focused on hinterland sediment supply, the role of alluvial storage in modulating sediment fluxes remains poorly understood, particularly in data-scarce Himalayan large rivers. To address this, we compiled sediment load data from existing studies across different sub-basins of the large Ganga River system to construct a basin-scale sediment budget. Using this integrated sediment budget, we examined spatial variability in sediment generation, transport and deposition across the Himalayan hinterland and alluvial plains. Our analysis reveals strong regional contrasts in sediment dispersal, driven by differences in uplift rates, precipitation and subsidence. The western Ganga rivers, covering 27% of the basin area, contribute only 9% of the total sediment load (385 Mt a−1) due to lower uplift rates and precipitation. This results in a supply-limited system with entrenched rivers and minimal sediment storage in the adjacent low-subsiding plains. In contrast, the Eastern Himalayan Hinterland is the dominant sediment source, generating 51% of the total load from 11% of the basin area; however, ∼45% of this sediment is trapped in the subsiding alluvial plains, forming aggradational channels. The Transitional Himalayan Hinterland bridges these extremes, contributing 23% of the sediment load from the hinterland covering 9% of basin area due to intermediate uplift and precipitation rate. This increases to 29% in the alluvial plains, where low subsidence—similar to the Western Ganga Plains—facilitates efficient sediment transfer downstream. We propose that transient storage in the Eastern Ganga Plains may become a key control on sediment dispersal over a centennial timescale, as increasing extreme precipitation events could shift the system from transport-limited to supply-limited. Accounting for these shifts is essential for effective sediment management and future planning."

The use of local forecast, however, faces challenges by increasing climate variability, which undermines farmers’ confidence in their forecast. This study addresses these challenges by developing a hybrid forecast that integrates both scientific and local forecast using machine learning techniques to improve precipitation predictions in northern Ghana. Results show that the hybrid forecast improves precipitation forecast accuracy by 23% and 33% compared to scientific forecast and local forecast, respectively. The best performance is achieved by combining two random forests (RFs) or a voting classifier and a RF. This research highlights the potential of machine learning to develop more accurate hybrid forecast than other statistical methods. Such enhanced precipitation forecasts could enable smallholder farmers in the Global South to make better-informed agricultural decisions, ultimately enhancing their livelihoods."

However, the increasing frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme climate events, especially in warm and humid regions, pose great challenges to the carbon sequestration efficiency and ecological stability of forest ecosystems. Consequently, understanding the different performances of planted versus natural forests under extreme conditions in such vulnerable regions is urgently needed. This study investigated the impacts of drought and heatwave events on the gross primary productivity (GPP) and water use efficiency (WUE) of natural and planted evergreen forests. The response of ecological stability to event intensity and duration was assessed by anomalies, and resistance and resilience were calculated using the GPP and WUE, respectively. Our findings revealed that (1) GPP anomaly was more sensitive to heatwaves, whereas WUE anomaly was more sensitive to drought in both forest types; notably, natural forests presented smaller GPP and WUE anomalies during extreme events; (2) natural forests presented superior resistance across varying intensities and durations, whereas planted forests generally presented greater resilience; and (3) threshold comparisons indicated that natural forests could withstand more intense drought and heatwaves. In terms of duration, natural forests presented greater resistance to drought events lasting up to three months, whereas planted forests presented greater resilience to heatwave events lasting more than two months. These findings provide valuable insights and guidance for forest management under climate extremes and contribute to a more reliable foundation for strategies to mitigate global warming."

Compared with β-lactam and sulfonamide antibiotics, tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics have longer environmental half-lives and are more widely used, particularly in agriculture, aquaculture, and healthcare. In this study, the composition, spatial distribution, potential sources, and ecological risks of 4 tetracycline and 20 quinolone antibiotics were systematically investigated by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the surface seawater of the Northeastern Indian Ocean for the first time. A total of nine antibiotics were detected in seawater samples, including tetracycline (detection rate: 100%), oxytetracycline (100%), chlortetracycline (100%), doxycycline (100%), ofloxacin (100%), ciprofloxacin (100%), norfloxacin (92.3%), enrofloxacin (96.2%), and fleroxacin (23.1%). Tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and enrofloxacin were widely distributed throughout the study area, with tetracycline antibiotics (83.8%) being significantly more prevalent than quinolone antibiotics. Among them, oxytetracycline was the dominant tetracycline antibiotic. The concentrations of tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics ranged from 0.258 to 23.521 ng l−1 (mean: 16.813 ng l−1) and 0.016–9.480 ng l−1 (mean: 3.261 ng l−1), respectively. The highest concentrations were found in the northeastern region of the study area. Aquaculture and livestock farming in Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia were identified as potential sources of these antibiotics. Ecological risk assessments indicated that ciprofloxacin poses a moderate risk to aquatic organisms in the Northeastern Indian Ocean. This study provides new insights into antibiotic pollution in the open waters of the Indian Ocean and highlights the urgent need for further research on the ecological impacts of these emerging pollutants in marine environments."

The results point to the importance of the fall speed of hydrometeor particles and to a simple relationship: the faster a condensate falls, the less there is of it. Implications for the energy balance and precipitation properties are discussed. 
 Cloud microphysics is a prime example of processes that remain unresolved in atmospheric modeling at storm-resolving resolution. In this study, we explore how uncertainties in the representation of microphysical processes affect the tropical condensate distribution in a global storm-resolving model. We use ICON in its global storm-resolving configuration, with a one- or two-moment microphysical scheme and perform several sensitivity runs, where, in each, we modify parameters of one hydrometeor category of the applied microphysics scheme. Differences between the one- and two-moment schemes are most prominent in partitioning frozen condensate in cloud ice and snow and can be understood in terms of the habit's definition for each scheme, which is associated with different process rates. Overall differences between the simulations are moderate and tend to be larger for individual condensate habits than for more integrated quantities, like cloud fraction or total condensate burden. Yet, the resulting spread in the tropical energy balance of several W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface is substantial. Although the modified parameters within one scheme generally affect different process rates, most of the change in the condensate amount of the modified habit and even the total condensate burden can be attributed to a single property: the change in fall speed. The tropical-mean precipitation efficiency is also well explained by changes in the relative fall speed across different habits in both schemes."

We traced water vapor paths, showing their impact on water supply and climate. This insight is key for predicting future water resources and climate patterns, offering a clearer understanding of our interconnected environmental systems. 
 Understanding water vapor sources and transport paths is essential for assessing the water cycle and predicting precipitation accurately. Utilizing water vapor diagnosis and calculations, this study determined the water vapor sources and transport paths leading to precipitation in the Dongting Lake basin in four seasons (represented by January, April, June, and October). In January, the water-vapor-generating precipitation originated from the Arabian Peninsula, driven by the southern branch of the westerlies over the southern side of the Tibetan Plateau, along the northern side of the Indian Peninsula through southwestern China to reach the Dongting Lake basin. In April, two transport paths emerged: one aligned closely with the January transport path but with the location shifted slightly northward by 1° of latitude and another driven by the weak subtropical high over the southwestern Pacific, bringing moist air from the western Pacific via the South China Sea and Indochinese Peninsula. In June, the vapor sourced from the northern branch of the southern Indian Ocean subtropical high crossed the Equator and transported through various waterbodies to southwestern China, finally reaching the basin. October saw a water vapor transport path from the western Pacific, crossing the South China Sea and entering the Dongting Lake basin, influenced by the East Asian monsoon system. In different seasons, the variations in water stable isotopes along water vapor transport paths show some agreement with Rayleigh fractionation and water balance principles, as reflected in the model simulations and observations. These findings highlight the impact of atmospheric circulation on precipitation and isotopes, providing a framework for understanding water vapor isotope mechanisms and reconstructing past atmospheric conditions. This research explored how water vapor transports influenced the precipitation isotopes in the Dongting Lake basin in representative months of different seasons. By tracking water vapor from its source regions, we revealed the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation on the transportation of water vapor to the Dongting Lake basin. The changes in water stable isotopes along the water vapor transport paths highlighted the isotopic fractionation and water vapor exchange that occurred along these paths, while the isotopic changes in the precipitation reflect the cumulative influences of water vapor transport on the local precipitation. These comprehensive insights have clarified the influences of atmospheric circulation on water vapor transport and precipitation isotopes and are thus essential for predicting regional precipitation patterns."

Measurements of the mass spectral absorption cross section (MAC), supplemented by literature data, allowed us to establish a generalised exponential relationship between the spectral absorption and the elemental-to-total-carbon ratio (EC / TC) in soot. This relationship can provide a useful tool for modelling the properties of soot. 
 Soot aerosol generated from the incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels is a major light-absorber; however its spectral optical properties for varying black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) content remain uncertain. In this study, soot aerosols with varying maturity and composition, i.e. elemental-to-total-carbon ratio (EC/TC), have been studied systematically in a large simulation chamber to determine their mass absorption, scattering, and extinction cross sections (MAC, MSC, MEC); single-scattering albedo (SSA); and absorption and scattering Ångström exponents (AAE, SAE). The MAC, MEC, SSA, and AAE show a variability between the different types of soot with varying EC/TC ratios. The MAC (MEC) at 550 nm increases for increasing EC/TC, with values of 1.0 (1.4) m2 g−1 for EC/TC = 0.0 (BrC-dominated soot) and 4.6 (5.1) m2 g−1 for EC/TC = 0.79 (BC-dominated soot). The AAE and SSA (550 nm) decrease from 3.79 and 0.29 (EC/TC = 0.0) to 1.27 and 0.10 (EC/TC = 0.79). Combining present results for soot from propane combustion with literature data for flame soot from diverse fuels supports a generalised exponential relationship between particle EC/TC and its MAC and AAE values (MAC550=(1.3±0.05) e(1.8±0.1)ECTC; AAE=(0.73±0.12)+(3.29±0.12) e-(2.32±0.30)ECTC), which represents the optical continuum of spectral absorption for soot with varying maturity. From this, it is possible to extrapolate a MAC of 7.9 and 1.3 m2 g−1 (550 nm) and an AAE (375–870 nm) of 1.05 and 4.02 for pure EC (BC-like) and pure OC (BrC-like) soot. The established relationship can provide a useful parameterisation for models to estimate the absorption from combustion aerosols and their BC and BrC contributions."

We develop data-driven models for MSAp at four Arctic stations. The data-driven models outperform the numerical models and reanalysis product and identified precursor source-, chemical-processing-, and removal-related features as being important for modeling MSAp. 
 Natural aerosol components such as particulate methanesulfonic acid (MSAp) play an important role in the Arctic climate. However, numerical models struggle to reproduce MSAp concentrations and seasonality. Here we present an alternative data-driven methodology for modeling MSAp at four High Arctic stations (Alert, Gruvebadet, Pituffik (formerly Thule), and Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow)). In our approach, we create input features that consider the ambient conditions experienced during atmospheric transport (e.g., dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emission, temperature, radiation, cloud cover, precipitation) for use in two data-driven models: a random forest (RF) regressor and an additive model (AM). The most important features were selected through automatic selection procedures, and their relationships with MSAp model output was investigated. Although the overall performance of our data-driven models on test data is modest (max. R2=0.29), the models can capture variability in the data well (max. Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.77), outperform the current numerical models and reanalysis products, and produce physically interpretable results.The data-driven models selected features which can be grouped into three categories, the sources, chemical processing, and removal of MSAp, with specific differences between stations. The seasonal cycles and selected features suggest gas-phase oxidation is relatively more important during peak concentration months at Alert, Gruvebadet, and Pituffik (Thule), while aqueous-phase oxidation is relatively more important at Utqiaġvik (Barrow). Alert and Pituffik (Thule) appear to be more influenced by processes aloft than in the boundary layer. Our models usually selected chemical-processing-related features as the main factors influencing MSAp predictions, highlighting the importance of properly simulating oxidation-related processes in numerical models."

Our study reveals that New Zealand's land absorbs more CO2 than previously estimated, particularly in areas dominated by indigenous forests. Our results highlight gaps in current national CO2 estimates and methods, suggesting a need for further research to improve emissions reports and refine approaches to track progress toward climate mitigation goals. 
 Accurate national-scale greenhouse gas source and sink estimates are essential to track climate mitigation efforts. Inverse models can complement inventory-based approaches for emissions reporting by providing independent estimates underpinned by atmospheric measurements, yet few nations have developed this capability for carbon dioxide (CO2). We present results from a decade-long (2011–2020) national inverse modelling study for New Zealand, which suggests a persistent carbon sink in New Zealand's terrestrial biosphere (-171±29 Tg CO2 yr−1). This sink is larger than expected from either New Zealand's Greenhouse Gas Inventory (−24 Tg CO2 yr−1) or prior terrestrial biosphere model estimates (-118±22 Tg CO2 yr−1; Biome-BGCMuSo and CenW). The largest differences are in New Zealand's South Island, in regions dominated by mature indigenous forests, generally considered to be near equilibrium, and certain grazed pasture regions. Relative to prior estimates, the inversion points to a reduced net CO2 flux to the atmosphere during the autumn/winter period. The overall findings of this study are robust with respect to extensive tests to assess the potential biases in the inverse model due to transport error, prior biosphere, ocean and fossil fuel estimates, background CO2, and diurnal cycles. We have identified CO2 exchange processes that could contribute to the gap between the inverse, prior and inventory estimates, but the magnitude of the fluxes from these processes cannot entirely explain the differences. Further work to identify the cause of the gap is essential to understand the implications of this finding for New Zealand's inventory and climate mitigation strategies."

We found that the performance of current γ (N2O5) parameterizations showed deviations with the varying aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). Such differences would lead to biased estimation of particulate nitrate production potential. We give suggestions for future research directions. 
 The heterogeneous hydrolysis of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is a critical process in assessing NOx fate and secondary pollutant formation. However, accurate quantification of the N2O5 uptake coefficient (γ (N2O5)) in ambient conditions is a challenging problem that can cause unpredictable uncertainties in the predictions of air quality models. Here, the γ (N2O5) values were directly measured using an improved in situ aerosol flow tube system at a site located in a highland region in southwestern China to investigate influencing factors and the performance of current γ (N2O5) parameterizations under this typical environmental condition. The nocturnal mean γ (N2O5) value ranged from 0.0018 to 0.12 with an average of 0.023±0.021. The relationship between the measured γ (N2O5) and impacting factors was consistent with previous laboratory results, except for aerosol chloride. The aerosol water significantly promoted N2O5 uptake, while particulate organics and nitrate showed suppression effects. We found that several parameterizations can capture the median of measured values, whereas none of the 10 parameterizations were able to reproduce the variabilities and showed poor correlations (R2=0.00–0.09). Elevated biases of predictions specifically occurred at high aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) (> 35 M) and low ALWC (< 25 M) levels with an underestimation of −37 % to −1 % and an overestimation of 34 % to 189 %, respectively. Such differences between the measured and parameterized γ (N2O5) would lead to a biased estimation (−77 % to 74 %) of the particulate nitrate production potential. Our findings suggest the need for more direct field quantifications of γ (N2O5) and laboratory measurements under extreme ALWC conditions to re-evaluate the response coefficients between γ (N2O5) and aerosol chemical compositions in parameterizations."

It is applied to the Météo-France global numerical weather prediction model, with the objective of simulating Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar reflectivity observations. Additionally, the simulation of the bright band is addressed and then successfully applied to model forecasts for the purpose of classifying NWP (numerical weather prediction) model columns between stratiform and convective categories. 
 Because of their high sensitivity to hydrometeors and high vertical resolutions, spaceborne radar observations are emerging as an undeniable asset for numerical weather prediction (NWP) applications. The EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) NWP SAF (Satellite Application Facility for Numerical Weather Prediction) released an active sensor module within version 13 of the RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder) software with the goal of simulating both active and passive microwave instruments within a single framework using the same radiative transfer assumptions. This study provides an in-depth description of this radar simulator. In addition, this study proposes a revised version of the existing melting-layer parameterization scheme of Bauer (2001) within the RTTOV-SCATT v13.1 model to provide a better fit to observations below the freezing level. Simulations are performed with the revised and default schemes for the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) instrument on board the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission using the ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle) global NWP model, operational at Météo-France for two different 1-month periods (June 2020 and January 2021). Results for a case study over the Atlantic Ocean show that the revised melting scheme produces more realistic simulations much closer to observations compared to the default scheme both at Ku (13.5 GHz) and Ka (35.5 GHz) frequencies. A statistical assessment covering several cases shows significant improvement of the first-guess departure statistics. As a step further, this study showcases the use of melting-layer simulations for the classification of precipitation (stratiform, convective, and transition) using the dual-frequency ratio (DFR) algorithm. The classification results reveal a significant overestimation of the rain reflectivities in both hemispheres, which could indicate either an overproduction of convective precipitation in ARPEGE or a misrepresentation of the convective precipitation fraction within the forward operator."

By adding unsupervised pre-training before supervised classification, our algorithm reduces manual labeling effort while maintaining high accuracy. It outperforms fully supervised models across datasets of varying sizes and categories, showing strong generalization ability. This method improves ice crystal classification techniques, making it adaptable to different environmental datasets. 
 The shapes of ice crystals play an important role in global precipitation formation and the radiation budget. Classifying ice crystal shapes can improve our understanding of in-cloud conditions and these processes. Existing classification methods rely on features such as the aspect ratio of ice crystals, environmental temperature, and so on, which bring high instability to the classification performance, or employ supervised machine learning algorithms that heavily rely on human labeling. This poses significant challenges, including human subjectivity in classification and a substantial labor cost in manual labeling. In addition, previous deep learning algorithms for ice crystal classification are often trained and evaluated on datasets with varying sizes and classification schemes, each with distinct criteria and a different number of categories, making it difficult to make a fair comparison of algorithm performance. To overcome these limitations, a contrastive semi-supervised learning (CSSL) algorithm for the classification of ice crystals is proposed. The algorithm consists of an upstream unsupervised learning network tasked with extracting meaningful representations from a large number of unlabeled ice crystal images, and a downstream supervised network is fine-tuned with a small subset of labeled images of the entire dataset to perform the classification task. To determine the minimum number of ice crystal images that require human labeling while maintaining the algorithm performance, the algorithm is trained and evaluated on datasets with varying sizes and numbers of categories. The ice crystal data used in this study were collected during the NASCENT campaign at Ny-Ålesund and CLOUDLAB project on the Swiss Plateau using a holographic imager mounted on a tethered balloon system. In general, the CSSL algorithm outperforms a purely supervised algorithm in classifying 19 categories. Approximately 154 h of manual labeling can be avoided using just 11 % (2048 images) of the training set for fine tuning, sacrificing only 3.8 % in overall precision compared to a fully supervised model trained on the entire dataset. In the four-category classification task, the CSSL algorithm also outperforms the purely supervised algorithm. When fine-tuned on just 2048 images (25 % of the dataset), it achieves an overall accuracy of 89.6 %, nearly matching the 91.0 % accuracy of the supervised algorithm trained on 8192 images. When tested on the unseen CLOUDLAB dataset, CSSL shows superior generalization, improving accuracy by an average of 2.19 %. Our analysis also reveals that both CSSL and purely supervised algorithms exhibit inherent instability when trained on small dataset sizes, and the performance difference between them converges as the training set size exceeds 2048 samples. These results highlight the strength and practical effectiveness of CSSL in comparison to purely supervised methods and the potential of the CSSL algorithm to perform well on datasets  collected under different conditions."

 The absence of validation or comparison data for verifying flood mapping methods poses a significant challenge in developing operational hydraulic approaches. This article aims to address this gap by presenting a benchmark dataset for flash flood mapping in the French Mediterranean region. The dataset described in this paper (https://doi.org/10.57745/IXXNAY, Nicolle et al., 2024) includes flood hazard maps and simulation results of three actual flash flood events, all computed in a steady regime at a 5 m resolution using a 2D SWE (shallow water equation) model (neglecting inertia) named Floodos (Davy et al., 2017). Additionally, it includes the input data necessary (digital terrain models, inflow discharges, hydrographic network) for conducting similar simulations with other hydrodynamic modelling approaches in both steady and unsteady regimes. A comprehensive validation dataset, comprising observed flood extents, high water marks, and rating curves, is also provided, enabling a detailed evaluation of 2D hydraulic simulation results. The simulation results from Floodos, compared against stage–discharge rating curves available at gauging stations, yielded highly encouraging outcomes.

However, little is known about the spatial distribution of the cultivated pastures due to the difficulty in distinguishing them from natural grasslands with remote sensing. For the first time, we have mapped the cultivated pastures on the plateau at a resolution of 30 m with decent accuracy. This dataset is valuable to scientists, policymakers, conservationists, and pastoralists. 
 Cultivated pastures have rapidly developed across the Tibetan Plateau over the past several decades, raising concerns about grassland degradation. Accordingly, considerable attention is paid to the protection of Tibetan grassland ecosystems. However, high-resolution spatial distribution of cultivated pastures on the Tibetan Plateau remains poorly understood, primarily due to the difficulty in discriminating cultivated pastures from other land cover types using remote sensing techniques. The absence of such information hinders efficient agricultural and livestock husbandry management, making it challenging to support ecological protection and restoration efforts. Here, we mapped the cultivated pastures on the Tibetan Plateau at a 30 m resolution for the years 1988 to 2021 using Landsat data from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. We built a random forest (RF) binary classification model with inputs of the spectral–temporal metrics of Landsat data acquired in the growing season, as well as ancillary topographic data. The model was trained using carefully selected training samples and was validated against 2000 independent random reference points in two pilot study regions with different climates and landscapes. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.05 % ± 0.4 % and an F1 spatial consistency score of 82.51 % ± 14.22 % (precision: 90.04 % ± 6.18 %; recall: 76.74 % ± 9.91 %), suggesting high confidence in mapping the distribution of cultivated pastures on the plateau. Using the RF model, we then produced a dataset of cultivated-pasture maps for the years from 1988 to 2021 for Qinghai Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the Tibetan Plateau, covering 77 % of the plateau. At both the province and county levels, the cultivated-pasture areas estimated in this study matched well with government statistics for recent years. The area of cultivated pastures on the Tibetan Plateau experienced a significant expansion from 0.46 Mha in 1988 to 1.57 Mha in 2021, with an average annual growth of 33.5±2.5 Kha. To our knowledge, we are the first to map cultivated pastures on the Tibetan Plateau, and our RF binary classification approach holds promise in identifying cultivated pastures in other regions of the world, which could prove to be invaluable for scientists, policymakers, ecological conservation practitioners, and herdspeople.

The framework integrated a process-based soil-crop model with vital physiological effects, a novel model upscaling method, and the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm at a parallel computing platform. The framework provides a valuable tool for multi-objective optimization of rice irrigation schemes at a large scale. 
 Rice cultivation faces multiple challenges from rising food demand as well as increasing water scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions, intensifying the tension of the food–water–climate nexus. Process-based modeling is pivotal for developing effective measures to balance these challenges. However, current models struggle to simulate their complex relationships under different water management schemes, primarily due to inadequate representation of critical physiological effects and a lack of efficient spatially explicit modeling strategies. Here, we propose an advancing framework that addresses these problems by integrating a process-based soil–crop model with vital physiological effects, a novel method for model upscaling, and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) multi-objective optimization algorithm at a parallel computing platform. Applying the framework accounted for 52 %, 60 %, 37 %, and 94 % of the experimentally observed variations in rice yield, irrigation water use, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions in response to irrigation schemes. Compared with the original model using traditional parameter upscaling methods, the advancing framework significantly reduced simulation errors by 35 %–85 %. Moreover, it well reproduced the multi-variable synergies and tradeoffs observed in China's rice fields and identified an additional 18 % areas feasible for irrigation optimization, along with an additional 11 % and 14 % reduction potentials of water use and methane emissions, without compromising production. Over 90 % of the potentials could be realized at the cost of 4 % less yield increase and 25 % higher nitrous oxide emissions under multiple objectives. Overall, this study provides a valuable tool for multi-objective optimization of rice irrigation schemes at a large scale. The advancing framework also has implications for other process-based modeling improvement efforts."

In urban areas, the OH concentration is extremely useful to determine the formation rate of secondary pollutants (i.e., ozone, particulate nitrate, secondary organic aerosol), but the in situ measurement of OH is extremely difficult due to its high reactivity and low concentration. In this study, we presented OH measurements in a megacity, Beijing, for two seasons. Though the chemical conditions were highly variable, we found that more than half of the OH variability could be attributed to changes in photolysis frequencies. We developed an empirical parametrization that successfully reproduces observed OH concentrations across different seasons in Beijing by considering photolysis rates and NO2 concentrations. This parametrization demonstrates sustained OH production even during winter haze, which is critical for understanding oxidation processes under low solar radiation. Our findings provide a valuable tool for improving air quality models in polluted urban environments and offer insights into effective pollution control strategies."

However, the environmental risks of PFOA degradation products have rarely been studied. In this study, PFOA (C8) was photocatalytically degraded with N-CQDs/TiO2, producing C3–C7 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and fluoride ions. We investigated bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of PFCAs in a model food web of Chlorella sp., Daphnia magna, and Danio rerio (zebrafish). Degradation-induced acidification of the solution increased the bioaccumulation of both residual PFOA and the newly formed PFCAs, and the long-chain PFCAs (C6–C8) were able to undergo trophic transfer. Unexpectedly, the degradation products exhibited higher acute toxicity than PFOA in all three organisms, with zebrafish showing the highest sensitivity. Subsequently, concentration-dependent transcriptomics and adverse outcome pathway (AOPs) analysis indicated lipid metabolism disorders, oxidative stress, skeletal toxicity, and neurotoxicity in zebrafish, which were verified by biomarker tests. The toxic contributions of PFCAs, fluoride ions, and acidic pH in degradation products were further assessed by exposing zebrafish to them individually or in combination. The results indicated that lipid metabolism disorders stem from the abnormal activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and liver X receptor (LXR) by PFCAs. Skeletal toxicity and oxidative stress are induced by the strong binding of fluoride ions to metallic elements. The solution acidification exacerbates toxic effects. The nervous system is particularly susceptible to exposure according to the lowest threshold concentration for neurotoxicity-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The degradation products impair neuronal development and disrupt neurotransmitter signaling. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the degradation of PFOA molecules does not equate to risk elimination; instead, incomplete degradation may heighten ecological toxicity and health risk."

This study developed and applied a method to quantify the yields for HO• and 3DOM* (expressed as ⌀HO• and fTMP, respectively) from far-UVC (UV222) photolysis of DOM. ⌀HO• at 222 nm (0.64–0.82%) is 13–34 times higher than at 254 nm and 136–213 times higher than at >290 nm. fTMP at 222 nm (293–1011 M–1) is 3.6–8.4 times and 1.8–19 times greater than at 254 nm and >290 nm, respectively. Electron-accepting moieties (e.g., carbonyl-containing compounds) are likely the major precursors of 3DOM* under UV222 irradiation. Despite DOM’s light-screening and radical-scavenging effects, the high ⌀HO• at 222 nm ensures that DOM has a negligible impact on HO• concentrations in the absence of other radical precursors (e.g., NO3–). Concurrently, enhanced 3DOM* generation accelerates the photosensitized activation of NH2Cl by 3-fold under UV222 irradiation compared to UV254. Given the critical roles of HO• and 3DOM* in micropollutant degradation, oxidant activation, and reactive species transformation, this work advances both the fundamental photochemistry and the practical application of far-UVC-driven water treatment technologies."

We provide the first experimental and modeling assessment of gas-particle multiphase OH oxidation of BPA and six common bisphenol alternatives. We examine the transformation of condensed-phase BPA and its alternatives using an oxidation flow reactor with products monitored by online mass spectrometry. Fourteen products were identified and used to develop a generic mechanism applicable to all bisphenols and to provide inputs into an environmental fate model (PROduction-to-Exposure; PROTEX). Our modeling results highlight the role of heterogeneous surface reactions in determining the indoor retention of these chemicals and their relative environmental persistence indoors and outdoors. All investigated parent molecules yield transformation products predicted to accumulate indoors, with extended indoor persistence if a long chemical lifetime on surfaces (e.g., >100 weeks) is assumed.

Conventional UV-based ARPs, however, face limitations in real-world applications due to inefficient light and chemical utilization as well as low yields of hydrated electrons (eaq–). In this study, we demonstrate that shifting the UV irradiation wavelength from 254 nm (UV254) to 222 nm (UV222) in the UV/sulfite ARP enhances the eaq– yield by 48.67-fold. Leveraging experimentally determined parameters, including the molar absorption coefficient of sulfite (1145 ± 11 M–1 cm–1) and its quantum yield for photolysis (0.104 ± 0.0070 mol Einstein–1) at 222 nm, we developed a kinetic model to predict eaq– concentrations in the UV222/sulfite system under diverse environmental and operational conditions. Using real tap water and surface water matrices, we show that the UV222/sulfite ARP reduces energy consumption by a factor of 4.19–16.18 compared to the conventional UV254/sulfite process during the degradation of halogenated contaminants, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Additionally, the UV222/sulfite system decreases cytotoxicity in natural organic matter (NOM)-laden water by 28% following chlorination, which is mainly attributed to the suppressed formation of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN)."

However, their precise inhibitory mechanisms and toxic targets within the photosynthetic pathways remain poorly understood. Through a combination of physio-biochemical indicators, multiomics analysis, and molecular docking simulation, this study systematically explored the photosynthetic toxic effects of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q on Ceratophyllum demersum L. (C. demersum). Transcriptomic data identified photosynthetic antenna proteins as primary molecular targets, with both contaminants perturbing the transcriptional regulation of genes and impairing the structural plasticity of associated proteins. These molecular perturbations consequently disrupted the photosynthetic electron transport efficiency. Metabolomic evidence revealed subsequent carbohydrate metabolism imbalances, suggesting compromised carbon fixation capacity of C. demersum. Additionally, molecular docking simulations demonstrated superior binding affinities for both compounds with antenna proteins, particularly emphasizing the enhanced interactions mediated by 6PPD-Q’s quinone structure. Comparative analysis indicated that 6PPD-Q’s structural modifications may confer greater photosynthetic toxicity compared to the parent  compound 6PPD. This multiomics investigation reveals the mechanistic basis of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q-driven photosynthetic toxicity and underscores their potential to destabilize aquatic ecosystems by disrupting primary productivity."

Partridge,A Wavier Polar Jet Stream Contributed to the Mid‐20th Century Winter Warming Hole in the United States,"Winter waves in the polar jet stream are associated with extreme cold outbreaks and can modulate longer‐term winter temperature trends in the mid‐latitudes. Recent research has highlighted a positive trend in jet stream waviness from 1990 to 2010, with a hypothesized connection to Arctic amplification of anthropogenic warming. However, an increase in jet stream waviness has also been hypothesized to contribute to the winter “warming hole” (WH) in eastern North America, a cooling phenomenon from 1958–1988, beginning several decades prior to the recent waviness trend. These potentially conflicting hypotheses highlight the uncertainty of long‐term jet stream waviness variability prior to the satellite era (1979–present). Here we develop a new record of wintertime jet stream waviness spanning 1901–2023 based on self‐organizing maps and nine different temperature and reanalysis data sets with the dual purpose of (a) understanding the historical variability of polar jet stream waviness in the eastern United States, and (b) quantifying the impact of jet stream waviness on WH‐era surface temperatures. Our analysis reveals elevated jet stream waviness in the 1960s–1980s that surpassed modern waviness levels, and we find that jet stream waviness contributed to two‐thirds of winter WH cooling beginning in 1958. These results are consistent with a strong connection between temperature trends in the eastern U.S. and jet stream troughing but indicate that additional mechanisms also contributed to the WH. Our analysis further highlights that recent increases in jet stream waviness are well within the range of early to mid‐20th century variability, prior to the emergence of Arctic amplification."

Prescribed (“Rx”) fire is often proposed to mitigate future wildfires, but treatments remain limited, and few studies quantify their effectiveness on recent major wildfires. We investigate the effects of Rx fire treatments on subsequent burn severity across western US ecoregions and particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions in California. Using high‐resolution (30‐m) satellite imagery, land management records, and fire emissions data, we employ a quasi‐experimental design to compare Rx fire‐treated areas with adjacent untreated areas to estimate the impacts of recent Rx fires (Fall 2018–Spring 2020) on the extreme 2020 wildfire season. We find that within 2020 wildfire burn areas where Rx fires were used prior to 2020, burn severity changed by −16% (p < 0.001) and smoke PM2.5 emissions changed by −101 kg per acre (p < 0.1). Rx fires in the wildland‐urban interface (“WUI”) were less effective in reducing burn severity and smoke PM2.5 emissions than those outside the WUI. Overall, Rx fires led to a net reduction of −14% in PM2.5 emissions, including those from the Rx fires themselves. The proposed policy of treating one million acres annually in California could reduce smoke emissions by 655,000 tons over the next 5 years, equivalent to 52% of the emissions from 2020 wildfires. Our analysis provides comprehensive estimates of the net benefits of Rx fire on subsequent burn severity and smoke PM2.5 emissions in the western US, an empirical basis for evaluating proposed Rx fire expansions, and valuable constraints for future modeling."

To enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of land surface‐atmosphere interactions and reduce the mismatches between Noah‐Multiparameterization Land Surface (Noah‐MP) simulations and observational data, we optimized the seven most sensitive parameters in the Noah‐MP for a 9‐day period (2–10 April 2016) at the Southern Great Plains site using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The implementation of Noah‐MP in the single‐column Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the application of BO allow for site‐level parameter estimation. The Noah‐MP shows an improvement in the simulation of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux when we use optimized parameters instead of the default parameters according to data from flux tower observations. The optimized parameter values indicate that the top layer (0–20 cm below the ground surface) of soil at the Southern Great Plains site may contain a higher sand content than indicated by the silty‐clay‐loam soil classification provided by AmeriFlux agricultural records. These optimized parameters also improve the simulation of atmospheric state variables, especially the 2‐m specific humidity, and result in improved top‐layer soil moisture and temperature simulations.

Intensification occurred despite inhibiting factors such as high axial tilt, high vertical wind shear, low atmospheric moisture, and transit over a relatively shallow continental shelf. Using a high‐resolution simulation of Hurricane Ian from the Hurricane Weather Research Forecasting (HWRF) model, we examine the factors that both hindered and supported rapid intensification (RI) by blending various methods. We show that an increase in diabatic heating in the eyewall led to an inward radial advection of momentum, seen in both the absolute angular momentum budget and in the azimuthal wind budget. Analysis of the moist static energy budget indicates that the substantial latent heat flux from the surface was enough to balance heat losses through storm outflow. For instance, surface latent heat fluxes exceeded 1,500 W m−2 on the West Florida Continental Shelf. As suggested by actual ocean temperature observations that substantially exceeded those in the HWRF simulation, the latent heating may have even been larger. Physical explanations for discrepancies between the simulated Hurricane Ian and observations are provided, particularly those pertaining to the coastal ocean at the time of Ian's passage. This research provides a comprehensive explanation of the RI of a hurricane using momentum budget analyses as part of a coupled air‐sea analysis. Our findings demonstrate the importance of in situ oceanic air‐sea measurements in evaluating the performance of coupled models, especially for hurricanes."

An important characteristic of MPCs is how the cloud phases are mixed, which affects interactions between ice and liquid. Observations show that phase tends to be nonuniform with ice and liquid forming spatially separated single‐phased “pockets” not accounted for in climate models. These pockets may vary in size from the micron‐scale to several hundred kilometers making them notoriously difficult to study, and the factors influencing cloud‐phase heterogeneity remain uncertain. We quantify size distributions of phase pockets in an observed and modeled Arctic MPC occurring 12 November 2019 in Ny‐Ålesund, Svalbard. The case is simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting model constrained with representative aerosol concentrations following measurements from the Ny‐Ålesund Aerosol Cloud Experiment. We find that phase pockets exhibit broad size distributions with the smallest pockets occurring most frequently. Observations reveal mean pocket lengths of 2 km, whereas the simulated pockets are about 5 times longer on average. Simulated pocket size distributions are highly sensitive to prescribed aerosols. Moreover, we observe a pronounced increase of 6.5 km in the mean length of mixed‐phase pockets when secondary ice production is enhanced in simulations. These results shed light on the link between cloud microphysics and the in‐cloud distribution of phase and provide a potential framework for representation of sub‐grid scale phase variability in climate models."

Here, the authors perform single cell RNA sequencing of PDX-derived samples from pediatric T-ALL patients at diagnosis and relapse and without relapse and identify treatment-resistant stem-like cells. 
 T-ALL relapses are characterized by chemotherapy resistance, cellular diversity and dismal outcome. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying relapses, we conduct single-cell RNA sequencing on 13 matched pediatric T-ALL patient-derived samples at diagnosis and relapse, along with samples derived from 5 non-relapsing patients collected at diagnosis. This comprehensive longitudinal single-cell study in T-ALL reveals significant transcriptomic diversity. Notably, 11 out of 18 samples exhibit a subpopulation of T-ALL cells with stem-like features characterized by a common set of active regulons, expression patterns and splice isoforms. This subpopulation, accounting for a small proportion of leukemia cells at diagnosis, expands substantially at relapse, indicating resistance to therapy. Strikingly, increased stemness at diagnosis is associated with higher risk of treatment induction failure. Chemotherapy resistance is validated through in-vitro and in-vivo drug testing. Thus, we report the discovery of treatment-resistant stem-like cells in T-ALL, underscoring the potential for devising future therapeutic strategies targeting stemness-related pathways.

Here, the authors show that HBV promotes HCC formation only in response to environmental carcinogens, involving increased IL-33 signaling and regulatory T cells. 
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Considering that most HBV-infected individuals remain asymptomatic, the mechanism linking HBV to hepatitis and HCC remains uncertain. Herein, we demonstrate that HBV alone does not cause liver inflammation or cancer. Instead, HBV alters the chronic inflammation induced by chemical carcinogens to promote liver carcinogenesis. Long-term HBV genome expression in mouse liver increases liver inflammation and cancer propensity caused by a carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN). HBV plus DEN-activated interleukin-33 (IL-33)/regulatory T cell axis is required for liver carcinogenesis. Pitavastatin, an IL-33 inhibitor, suppresses HBV plus DEN-induced liver cancer. IL-33 is markedly elevated in HBV+ hepatitis patients, and pitavastatin use significantly correlates with reduced risk of hepatitis and its associated HCC in patients. Collectively, our findings reveal that environmental carcinogens are the link between HBV and HCC risk, creating a window of opportunity for cancer prevention in HBV carriers.

 The seasonal freeze-thaw (FT) cycles of the permafrost active layer and seasonally frozen ground have significant impacts on ecosystems. Advances in remote sensing have enabled global monitoring of seasonal surface FT cycles. However, previous studies have generally overlooked the impact of remote sensing dataset accuracy on multiple FT parameters and have failed to sufficiently explore the changes in thawing and freezing intervals (TI/FI) in the Northern Hemisphere. This study evaluates the FT-ESDR remote sensing product using site-observed soil temperature data and provides a comprehensive analysis of surface FT characteristics in the Northern Hemisphere, with a focus on freezing and thawing intervals based on FT parameters calculated using a 15-day moving window method. The results indicate that the FT status calculated from site data shows strong agreement with remote sensing data products, with this agreement varying by season, land cover type, air temperature, precipitation. Compared to the FT parameters calculated from site data, FT-ESDR dataset underestimate several FT parameters. Combined analysis of site observation data and remote sensing data products indicates the presence of permafrost degradation, characterized by a longer thawed duration (TD), shorter frozen duration (FD), earlier start of thawing (SOT) and end of thawing (EOT), delayed start of freezing (SOF) and end of freezing (EOF), and reduced FT frequency (FTCF1/FTCF2) for both thawing and freezing seasons. The variations in FT parameters differ based on vegetation and permafrost types. The thawing interval (TI) and freezing interval (FI) show a shortening trend at most sites, indicating an acceleration of the surface thawing and freezing processes. The shortening of TI/FI during thawing/freezing is associated with increased/decreased air temperatures during the corresponding periods. Notably, the variation characteristics of sites in agricultural land differ from those in other land cover types. Overall, our results highlight the underestimation of FT parameters derived from the FT-ESDR dataset and their sensitivity to environmental factors. It also emphasizes the acceleration of surface thawing and freezing processes, which are influenced by air temperature."

 NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data, although the only ones to allow a daily monitoring of our planet during the 80s and 90s, are underused because of their platforms orbital drift, which introduces an artificial decreasing trend in surface temperatures. Despite the clearly observable effects, no quantitative measure of this orbital drift effect exists. Using MSG-SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation – Spinning Enhanced Visible Infra-Red Imager) data, which temporal resolution allows for an adequate simulation of drifted and undrifted AVHRR-like time series, we propose and analyze the behavior of a Drift Amplitude Metric (DAM), based on the difference in average LST temperatures between the first and the last year of a given satellite activity period. We then apply this metric to LTDR V6 (Long Term Data Record – Version 6) channel 4 brightness temperature to evaluate its utility. Our results enable quantification of the amplitude of the orbital drift effect, particularly pronounced for the NOAA 14 platform, and in more heterogeneous land cover types (Savannas, Grasslands and Shrublands). These findings are confirmed using real-case scenarios (LTDR V6 data). We show that the mentioned metric is more effective when applied to an ensemble of pixels (several hundreds) to identify time series impacted by orbital drift. This metric will be used to assess the quality of orbital drift correction methods in future work."

 Recently, graph clustering has been applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering and proves to be effective on capturing the complex affinity among hyperspectral samples to a certain extent. However, graph clustering based on sample-level affinity usually suffers from a heavy computation overhead due to the generation of coefficient matrices. Meanwhile, since the spatial information of HSIs may not be sufficiently utilized in these methods, it is difficult for them to obtain robust clustering performance when processing various HSIs. In order to alleviate the negative effect of sample-level affinity, we achieve evolving superpixel-level affinity (ESA) by collaboratively integrating the sample-level contrastive learning (CL) for learning discriminative features with finding the inter-superpixel good neighbors (GN) of each sample. Initially, CL is operated based on the assumption of homogeneous superpixels to pull together samples from the same superpixel and the learned features are fed to the smooth representation model to pursue the representation coefficients that used for generating GN. Then, the superpixel-level affinity is updated by simply converting the similarity between samples in each pair of GN into the similarity of the corresponding superpixels. By combining the homogeneous assumption of superpixels with the updated superpixel-level affinity, further CL is achieved to acquire more GN. In this way, CL and generation of GN works collaboratively to evolutionarily solve the superpixel-level affinity. When the process finishes, density-based spectral clustering is first implemented on several affinity matrices selected by designed growth rate of Eigenvalues of normalized Laplacian matrix to obtain clustering results of superpixels. The superpixel-to-pixels projection is then applied to these results to gain clustering maps. Finally, the majority vote strategy is adopted to realize the final clustering. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark HSIs demonstrate that the proposed ESA method is superior to the considered baseline counterparts in terms of clustering accuracy."

 This study explored the combustion characteristics, kinetics, pollutant formation, and reduction mechanisms of corn straw (CS)-processed fuels in residential applications. CS was collected to prepare CS briquettes (CSB) and CS charcoal (CSC). Derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) peaks implied that the combustion of CS, CSB, and CSC was dominated by pyrolysis, pyrolysis and char combustion, char combustion, respectively. Briquetting considerably decreased the devolatilization index (D) (66.4 %) and the maximum weight loss rate (DTGmax) (55.0 %); therefore, the CSB exhibited controlled pyrolysis and lower pollutant emissions than CS. Moreover, carbonization led to a considerable reduction in volatile matter (VM) content; thus, CSC exhibited lower pollutant emissions than CS. Both CSB and CSC successfully achieved significant emission reductions compared to CS for SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and its sub-factions include organic carbon (OC), element carbon (EC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), inorganic ions and metals. CSC is a little more effective in most pollutants' reduction, and much more effective in EC reduction, yet less effective in ions reduction compared to CSB. EC emissions positively correlate with VM content (R2 = 0.989), which lead to the more remarkable EC reduction in CSC for CSC's much lowered VM content.

 Continuous aerosol monitoring in East Asia is essential due to the massive aerosol emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources. Geostationary satellites enable continuous aerosol monitoring; however, the observation is limited to the daytime. This study proposed machine learning-based models to estimate daytime and nighttime aerosol optical depth (AOD) in East Asia using a geostationary satellite, Geo-KOMPSAT-2A (GK-2A). The input variables for the machine learning models include the brightness temperature (BT) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from GK-2A, meteorological and geographical data, and auxiliary variables. The two models that used different combinations of GK-2A variables were proposed and compared: the all-day BT model, which estimates AOD during both day and night using BT variables, and the daytime TOA model, which estimates AOD during the day using TOA reflectance variables as well. The estimated AODs by the models were validated with ground-based AOD data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) by 10-fold cross-validation and hold-out validation methods. The performance of the daytime TOA model was slightly higher than the all-day BT model during the day (R2 = 0.80–0.82, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.107–0.116 for the all-day BT model, R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.098 for the daytime TOA model). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis showed that total precipitable water content and seasonality contributed the most for both proposed models. BT differences and TOA reflectance variables were identified as the next most contributing variables for the all-day BT and daytime TOA models.

 Field observations highlight high H2O2 level and enhanced sulfate production during haze episodes in China, but so far, the known H2O2 sources and traditional secondary sulfate formation mechanisms cannot elucidate these phenomena. In recent years, the atmospheric photosensitized multiphase oxidation of SO2 to trigger sulfate production has attracted great attention. However, few reports on the contributions of triplet excited states and its secondary reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed in photosensitization reaction to sulfate formation. In this study, the aqueous photochemistry of water-soluble humic-like substances (HULIS) proxy was further investigated. It was found that hydroxyl radicals and peroxyl radicals were produced after 313 nm UV irradiation, accompanied by H2O2 production. The effect of HULIS photosensitization on SO2 oxidation was also investigated. The results showed that the triplet excited states of HULIS (3HULIS∗) cannot directly and effectively oxidize SO2 to form sulfate, but the formation of sulfate was realized by the oxidation of ROS generated by the secondary reaction of 3HULIS∗ in the presence of O2 and hydrogen atom donors such as HULIS itself. These findings clarify the misunderstood role of the 3HULIS∗ in the photosensitized oxidation of SO2, and the study helps better understand atmospheric photosensitization processes."

 Accurate pixel-scale precipitation estimation is essential for hydrological modeling and water resource management, underscoring the need for improved bias correction (BC) and data fusion techniques. This study evaluates several BC methods—including Classic and Orographic approaches—and examines Multiple Collocation (MC) and Triple Collocation (TC) for data fusion and error analysis. Ten satellite-based precipitation products are assessed alongside gauge-based methods (PRISM and Modified Inverse Distance Weighting, MIDW) across three diverse watersheds: Urmia, Karkheh, and Tashk-Bakhtegan. Results show that TERRA, IMERG, MSWEP, and CHIRPS perform consistently well, while PERSIANN, GLDAS, and FLDAS show lower accuracy, especially in high-elevation areas. Orographic BC methods—Quantile-Quantile Mapping (QQM-ORO), Linear Scaling (LS-ORO), and Power Transformation (PT-ORO)—outperform Classic counterparts (QQM-CLS, LS-CLS, PT-CLS), particularly in mountainous regions. While MC improves on some individual Raw products, it remains less effective than BC methods and provides only limited benefit. Overall, the findings highlight the value of incorporating orographic effects in BC, recommend TC as a benchmark for raster accuracy, and support gauge-based methods (PRISM, MIDW) for generating high-quality precipitation datasets."

 In recent years, the frequency of Dry-wet abrupt alternation (DWAA) has gradually increased. However, the climate factors of the spatio-temporal pattern of DWAA events on a national scale are still not well understood, and the research on the correlation of DWAA with rain belt/season in China has not been investigated so far. This study explored the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of the frequency, intensity, and alternation timing of DWAA events over the whole China during 1961–2018, and then intensively investigated the relationship between the changes of DWAA and the summer rain belt/season in the whole China. The research results can be summarized: (1) The DWAA events primarily occurred in the eastern China, the frequency of wet-to-dry (WTD) events declined significantly from 1961 to 1990, and future trends in DWAA frequency and intensity are expected to follow the historical patterns in the whole China. The intensity of DWAA events with alternation timing in May and August was stronger than that in June and July. (2) In the eastern China, the alternation timing of dry-to-wet (DTW) events and WTD events corresponded well to the advance of summer rain belt, and the alternation timing of DWAA during 1991–2018 occurred earlier than that in 1961–1990, driven by the decadal advance of the onset of the SCSSM. In the western China, the alternation timing of DWAA was aligned with the seasonal shift between the rainy and dry periods. (3) The five Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) indices showed a strong correlation with DWAA in the eastern China, and a weaker correlation in the western China. Moreover, the correlation between DWAA and WPSH in the eastern China strengthened in 1990–2018 compared to that in 1961–1990. The composite DWAAI tended to be higher (lower) in the strong (weak) WPSH years. Therefore, the activity of WPSH was an important factor affecting the frequency and intensity of DWAA."

 The Canary Archipelago, due to its location between the tropics and subtropics, represents a key region for studying precipitation moisture sources. This study provides a high-resolution (20 km) climatological analysis of the moisture sources for potential precipitation in the archipelago from 1985 to 2022, applying a dynamic downscaling methodology (WRF-ARW) and a Lagrangian approach considering the trajectories of potentially precipitating particles (FLEXPART-WRF model). The analysis differentiates between precipitation and non-precipitation days, western and eastern islands, and moisture transport above and below the trade wind inversion layer (at 900 hPa). Results indicate that the main moisture source for the archipelago is the North Atlantic (up to 74 % annually), and a crucial contribution comes from the northeast region of the islands, especially under prevailing trade wind conditions. During the summer, moisture from the African continent further enhances its contribution up to 16 % for the total moisture transported. The moisture pattern is more pronounced on days with precipitation, extending longitudinally towards the western Atlantic, and showing the largest positive anomalies during intense precipitation events. Notably, our findings highlight the strong contribution of moisture from the northeast above the inversion layer, even on non-precipitation days. Additionally, differences in precipitation moisture source patterns were observed between the eastern and western islands, with positive anomalies in the northern sector for the former and the western one for the latter, each associated with different circulation patterns."

 The Bay of Bengal storms (BoB storms) are the most catastrophic weather conditions in the region of Bay of Bengal and pose a significant threat to countries within and adjacent to the region, highlighting the urgent need for accurate forecasts to increase disaster prevention and mitigation efforts. However, sparse observations limit the accuracy of the BoB storm forecasts. Current numerical forecast systems adopt “target observation” strategy to increase additional observations and improve the forecast skill, but still face challenge of low efficiency and allow more model error effects on efficacy of additional observations. The study adopts a highly efficient Artificial Intelligence-driven “Pangu-Weather” model and constructs an optimization system for identifying sensitive areas of target observations associated with the BoB storm track forecasts based on the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) method. The CNOP method comprehensively accounts for nonlinear processes and has been verified to be superior to traditional linear approximation methods, such as singular vector, adjoint sensitivity, and ETKF. Based upon this system, the sensitive areas for target observations were determined for 12 forecasts of four strong BoB storms and their roles were evaluated in terms of the improvement of the storm track forecast level through observing system simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that preferentially improving the accuracy of the initial conditions in the sensitive areas, compared with doing it in randomly selected areas, can be more significant to upgrade the storm track forecast level; however, such upgrades only hold for the forecast duration of 24 h. This result provides hints for the potential of the Pangu-Weather model in forecasting BoB storms and has the implication that the predictability of the “Pangu-Weather” model with respect to the BoB storm tracks is dominantly constrained by model error effects after 24 h. It suggests that the improvement of model architecture is necessary for prolonging the predictability time of Pangu-Weather with respect to the BoB storms."

Here, we demonstrate that VIRMA-mediated m6A modification is essential for active ribosome biogenesis. VIRMA depletion destabilizes the entire writer complex and reduces m6A levels, leading to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of neural progenitor/stem cells, ultimately causing severe forebrain developmental defects. Mechanistically, VIRMA depletion impairs ribosome biogenesis by inhibiting mRNA decay, triggering a p53-dependent stress response and compromising global protein synthesis.

Metabolomics and transcriptomics interaction revealed that the cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD)–regulated taurine pathway was involved in NMNAT1-disrupted hepatic lipid metabolism in ALD. Hepatic CSAD overexpression or taurine supply attenuated hepatic NMNAT1 knockout–aggravated ALD. Hepatic NMNAT1 loss inhibited NMN-protected ALD.

Understanding its past response to climate change is critical for anticipating future sea-level rise. We present a multi-proxy reconstruction of ocean and cryosphere conditions in the Ross Sea over the past 40,000 years. Our data show that warm Circumpolar Deep Water reached the JOIDES Trough in the western Ross Sea shortly after the Last Glacial Maximum, coinciding with the retreat of an ancestral ice shelf. This oceanic warming aligns with a southward shift of both the westerly and easterly wind belts, indicating a large-scale atmospheric mechanism driving regional ocean changes. The timing and nature of these processes reveal the tight coupling between atmospheric circulation, ocean heat transport, and ice shelf dynamics. These interactions led to reduced ice shelf extent, highlighting the role of ocean-atmosphere coupling in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean during deglaciation."

While these cycles are typically inversely locked in-phase, recent research has identified diurnal hysteresis, characterized by a time lag betweenTand RH; yet, its impact on VPD under changing climates remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine how diurnalT/RH hysteresis modulates VPD across different climates using observational data alongside high-resolution reanalysis and simulations. Here, we find that regions exhibiting strong diurnalT/RH hysteresis, especially in some waterside and montane regions, experience earlier daily VPD peaks. We also demonstrate that global warming weakens diurnalT/RH hysteresis, leading to amplified VPD increasing trends and greater ecosystem stress. These results highlight the need for improved representation of diurnalT/RH interactions in climate models to better predict atmospheric dryness and its impacts on land-atmosphere feedbacks, ecosystems, and regional water cycles."

Vincent,Automorphy as a self-organizing DPP-dependent process that translates patterns into mechanical programs during Drosophila embryogenesis,"Morphogens provide developing tissues with positional information to ensure coherent morphogenesis. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) initially form a gradient to pattern the dorsal domains of theDrosophilaembryo. Here, we show that the BMP homolog decapentaplegic (DPP) endows dorsal domains with specific mechanical programs to organize morphogenesis. These domains self-organize using high local DPP activities, a process we call automorphy. Automorphy is key to inducing specific morphological changes while being faithful to the initial positional information. The BMP morphogen therefore uses a series of automorphic events to translate each position into physical potentials that later produce a contractile amnioserosa and a dorsal epidermis displaying plasticity. Plasticity allows cell elongation in wild-type embryos, and perturbations of cellular patterns reveal its crucial role in adapting to mechanical constraints. We propose that gradient formation and automorphy constitute complementary processes that allow BMPs to act as a morphogen in theDrosophilaembryo."

By applying an imperceptible current, the FMEIS can target multiple deep muscles by capturing electric-field ripples generated by their contractions. With an ultrathin profile (~220 micrometers), a low elastic modulus (212.8 kilopascals) closely matching human skin, and engineered adhesive sensor surfaces, the FMEIS conforms nicely to human skin with minimized motion artifacts.

Furthermore, the expressions ofOsDREB1AandOsNAC3are positively regulated by each other, and the cis-regulatory polymorphisms in promoters fine-tune their corresponding expressions to determine the natural variations of postgermination growth.

By analyzing NY-ESO-1123–137/HLA-DRB3*02:02–restricted CD4 T cell clones, we uncovered an unexpectedly high cytotoxicity, strong T helper 1 polarization, and recurrent αβ T cell receptor (TCRαβ) usage across patients and anatomical sites. These responses were also present in other NY-ESO-1–expressing cancers. TCRs from these clones, when transduced into primary CD4 T cells, showed direct antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that these TCRs are promising for adoptive T cell transfer therapy, enabling broader targeting of NY-ESO-1–expressing adult and pediatric cancers in clinical settings."

Here, we introduce the adaptive optics rolling slit ophthalmoscope, a unique noninvasive, label-free, high-speed, cellular-resolution clinical imaging system for assessing retinal NVC in the living human eye. Using an off-axis phase contrast approach combined with camera-based confocal slit gating, our method provides large field-of-view imaging of arterial and venular walls, enabling the study of vascular dynamics with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Our findings highlight that this level of precision is essential for accurately distinguishing NVC-driven vasodilation from spontaneous fluctuations, such as vasomotion and the cardiac cycle. By bridging the gap between fundamental neurovascular research and clinical applications, this approach offers a powerful tool for neuroscience research and early disease detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative and vascular disorders."

However, an in-depth understanding of mechanical strain, including residual strain in halide perovskites, remains incomplete, coupled with the critical challenge of decoupling strain effects from other interferences. Here, we examine the relaxation of residual tensile strain in three-dimensional (3D) halide perovskites through 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction formation. The 2D perovskite induces structural fragmentation in 3D perovskites, facilitating plastic relaxation of tensile strain. By isolating extrinsic crystalline phase interference and exciton-related optical disturbances, we observe that 3D perovskites retain high crystallinity only with moderate tensile strain relaxation. This moderate relaxation enhances optoelectronic properties in 3D perovskites, including broadened band-to-band absorption and prolonged charge carrier lifetime, markedly contributing to an increase in the maximum attainable power conversion efficiency in photovoltaic devices. Our findings outline conditions for strain relaxation that optimize optoelectronic properties, advancing strain engineering in halide perovskites."

Mutations in the human citrate transporter SLC13A5, highly expressed in neurons, have been associated with a debilitating form of epileptic encephalopathy. In this study, we used deep mutational scanning to reveal the effect of 90% of all possible single missense variants on the structure and function of SLC13A5. Computational analyses and a detailed experimental validation of 38 variants revealed an accuracy of 86% and provided mechanistic interpretations for deleterious mutations, including the effect on protein stability, trafficking, and citrate transport. Analyses of blood citrate concentration from individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank study supported our analyses. The results illustrate an unbiased mutational landscape of the citrate transporter, illuminate mechanisms of pathogenicity, and offer a platform for the analysis of specific variants as well as opportunities for the future development of intervention strategies."

Here, we present a combination of minimally invasive recording and disruption studies to show that DRN brings about changes in motivation states. We use recently developed methods for identifying temporal patterns in behavior to show that monkeys change their motivation depending on the availability of rewards in the environment. Distinctive patterns of DRN activity occur when monkeys transition between a high-motivation state occupied when rewards are abundant, to a low-motivation state engendered by reward scarcity. Disrupting DRN diminishes sensitivity to the reward environment and perturbs transitions in motivational states."
