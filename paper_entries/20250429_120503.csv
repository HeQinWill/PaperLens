Erickson;Shun-Rong Zhang;David McGaw;Terrence Kovacs,Tracking traveling ionospheric disturbances through Doppler-shifted AM radio transmissions,"Traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) are manifestations of atmospheric waves that are significant for the transfer of energy and momentum between atmospheric layers and regions. This work demonstrates that velocities and directions of TIDs can be measured by monitoring the tiny shift in frequency of AM radio signals when they reflect from a moving ionosphere and that this method can be scaled to use large numbers of radio receivers and transmitters to monitor TIDs on a continental scale. 
 Six specialized radio receivers were developed to measure the Doppler shift of amplitude modulation (AM) broadcast radio carrier signals due to ionospheric effects. Five were deployed approximately in a circle at a one-hop distance from an 810 kHz clear-channel AM transmitter in Schenectady, New York, and the sixth was located close to the transmitter, providing a reference recording. Clear-channel AM signals from New York City and Connecticut were also received. The experiment confirmed detection of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) and measurement of their horizontal phase velocities through monitoring variations in the Doppler shift of reflected AM signals imparted by vertical motions of the ionosphere. Comparison of 12 events with simultaneous global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based TID measurements showed generally good agreement between the two techniques slightly more than half the time and substantial differences slightly less than half the time, with differences attributable to differing sensitivities of the techniques to wave altitude and characteristics within a complex wave environment. Detected TIDs had mostly southward phase velocities, and in four cases they were associated with auroral disturbances that could plausibly be their sources. A purely automated software technique for event detection and phase velocity measurement was developed and applied to 1 year of data, revealing that AM Doppler sounding is much more effective when using transmitter signals in the upper part of the AM band (above 1 MHz) and demonstrating that the AM Doppler technique has promise to scale to large numbers of receivers covering continent-wide spatial scales."

Here, we describe multiple field datasets and a detailed habitat classification map for the Lena Delta. We present context and methods of these openly available datasets and show how they can improve our understanding of the rapidly changing Arctic tundra system. 
 The Lena Delta is the largest river delta in the Arctic (about 30 000 km2) and prone to rapid changes due to climate warming, associated cryosphere loss, and ecological shifts. The delta is characterized by ice-rich permafrost landscapes and consists of geologically and geomorphologically diverse terraces covered with tundra vegetation and of active floodplains, featuring approximately 6500 km of channels and over 30 000 lakes. Because of its broad landscape and habitat diversity, the delta is a biodiversity hotspot with high numbers of nesting and breeding migratory birds, fish, caribou, and other mammals and was designated a State Nature Reserve in 1995. Characterizing plant composition, aboveground biomass, and application of field spectroscopy was a major focus of a 2018 expedition to the delta. These field data collections were linked to Sentinel-2 satellite data to upscale local patterns in land cover and associated habitats to the entire delta. Here, we describe multiple field datasets collected in the Lena Delta during summer 2018 including foliage projective cover (Shevtsova et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.935875), aboveground biomass (Shevtsova et al., 2023, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.956067; Shevtsova et al., 2023, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.935923), and hyperspectral field measurements (Runge et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945982). We further describe a detailed Sentinel-2 satellite image-based classification of habitats for the central Lena Delta (Landgraf et al., 2025a, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945057; Landgraf et al., 2025b, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945056; Landgraf et al., 2025c, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945055; Landgraf et al., 2025d, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945054), an upscaled classification for the entire Lena Delta (Lisovski et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.946407), and the test data set for accuracy assessment (Heim et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14731823) and a synthesis product for disturbance regimes (Heim and Lisovski, 2023, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7575691) in the delta that is based on the classification, the described datasets, and field expertise. We present context and detailed methods of these openly available datasets and show how their combined use can improve our understanding of the rapidly changing Arctic tundra system. The new Lena Delta habitat classification represents a first baseline against which future observations can be compared. The link between such detailed habitat classifications and disturbance regime may provide a better understanding of how Arctic lowland landscapes will respond to climate change and how this will impact land surface processes."

The average MAGT15 m of the QTP permafrost was −1.85 °C, with 90 % of the values ranging from −5.1 to −0.1 °C and 51.2 % exceeding −1.5 °C. The data can serve as a crucial boundary condition for deeper permafrost assessments and a reference for model simulations. 
 Ground temperature at a fixed depth is a crucial boundary condition for understanding the properties of deep permafrost. However, the commonly used mean annual ground temperature at the depth of the zero annual amplitude (MAGTDZAA) has certain limitations for extensive application due to large spatial heterogeneity at observed depths. In this study, we utilized 231 borehole records of mean annual ground temperature at a depth of 15 m (MAGT15 m) from 2010 to 2019 and employed a method of support vector regression (SVR) to predict the gridded MAGT15 m at a spatial resolution of nearly 1 km across the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The SVR model predictions demonstrated an R2 value of 0.48 with a negligible negative overestimation (−0.01 °C). The average MAGT15 m of the QTP permafrost was −1.85 ± 1.58 °C, with 90 % of the values ranging from −5.1 to −0.1 °C and 51.2 % greater than −1.5 °C. The ground surface freezing degree day (FDD) was the most significant predictor (p<0.001) of MAGT15 m, followed by the ground surface thawing degree day (TDD), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and soil bulk density (BD) (p<0.01). Overall, the MAGT15 m increased from northwest to southeast and decreased with rising elevation. Lower MAGT15 m values prevail in high mountainous areas with steep slopes. The MAGT15 m was lowest in the headwater areas of the Amu Darya, Indus, and Tarim river basins (−2.9 to −2.7 °C) and highest in the headwater areas of the Yangtze and Yellow river basins (−0.9 to −0.8 °C). The baseline dataset of the MAGT15 m for the QTP permafrost regions during 2010–2019 will facilitate simulations of deep permafrost characteristics and provide fundamental data for permafrost model validation and improvement.

We developed a 1995–2023 dataset that enhances satellite-based plant activity measurements by resolving data inconsistencies and improving resolution. Using advanced modeling, we harmonized signals from multiple satellites, cutting errors by 45 %. This offers clearer global photosynthesis trends, aiding climate research and vegetation monitoring. 
 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a crucial proxy of photosynthetic processes in vegetation. In recent decades, advancements in remote sensing technology have facilitated long-term global SIF monitoring, significantly enhancing our understanding of vegetation dynamics on a global scale. Despite this progress, current SIF datasets face major challenges, including temporal inconsistencies among various satellite-derived products and a lack of long-term, high-resolution observations. In this study, we developed a “Long-term Harmonized SIF” (LHSIF) dataset spanning 1995 to 2023 with a fine spatial resolution of 0.05° by coordinating SIF satellite observations from GOME, SCIAMACHY, GOME-2, and OCO-2. Light use efficiency (LUE)-based spatial downscaling models were employed for each SIF product to generate fine-resolution global SIF maps. The long-term dataset was constructed using temporally corrected GOME-2A SIF (TCSIF) as a benchmark and was combined with a moment-matching normalization method for far-red SIF harmonization across satellite sensors from GOME, SCIAMACHY, and OCO-2. The resulting harmonization dataset exhibits a 45 % reduction in overall error and a stable interannual increase (0.42 ± 0.13 % yr⁻¹) compared with a fluctuating decline (−0.57 ± 0.27 % yr⁻¹) of the original observations. This result strongly aligns with the growth rate of gross primary production (GPP, 0.47 ± 0.03 % yr-1) and is consistent with ground-based SIF observations (R > 0.60). Therefore, the long-term harmonized SIF dataset with a fine 0.05° resolution is a valuable tool for estimating global photosynthesis over extended periods.

The dataset combines traditional microscopy-based phytoplankton counts with zooplankton data (abundances) obtained from digitized images using the ZooScan imaging system, along with surface and bottom temperature and salinity measurements. Sampling was conducted seasonally along two main transects and three coastal stations, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics of plankton communities. Phytoplankton was identified at the species level by the same taxonomist during all the time-series (573 taxa in total). From their individual images, zooplankton was automatically sorted into 103 taxonomic and morphological groups, validated by an expert, and compiled into a data table allowing both community and individual approaches using abundances and biovolumes at both individual and community levels. Individual zooplankton images have also been made available for further morphometric analyses. This 14-year long, spatially and temporally resolved zooplankton imaging dataset is part of an ongoing effort to enhance the availability of zooplankton imaging data, locally and globally.

To help predict how wildfires will change in future, global fire models are being developed. We analyze and further develop one such model, SPITFIRE. Our work identifies and corrects sources of substantial bias in the model that are important to the global fire modelling field. With this analysis and these developments, we help to provide a basis for future improvements. 
 Since its development in 2010, the SPITFIRE global fire model has had a substantial impact on the field of fire modelling using dynamic global vegetation models. It includes process-based representations of fire dynamics, including ignitions, fire spread, and fire effects, resulting in a holistic representation of fire on a global scale. Previously, work had been undertaken to understand the strengths and weaknesses of SPITFIRE and similar models by comparing their outputs against remotely sensed data. We seek to augment this work with new validation methods and extend it by completing a thorough review of the theory underlying the SPITFIRE model to better identify and understand sources of modelling uncertainty. We find several points of improvement in the model, the most impactful being an incorrect implementation of the Rothermel fire spread model that results in large positive biases in fire rate of spread and a live grass moisture parametrization that results in unrealistically dry grasses. The combination of these issues leads to excessively large and intense fires, particularly on the dry modelled grasslands. Because of the tall flames present in these intense fires, which can cause substantial damage to tree crowns, these issues bias SPITFIRE toward high tree mortality. We resolve these issues by correcting the implementation of the Rothermel model and implementing a new live grass moisture parametrization, in addition to several other improvements, including a multi-day fire spread algorithm, and evaluate these changes in the European domain. Our model developments allow SPITFIRE to incorporate more realistic live grass moisture content and result in more accurate burnt area on grasslands and reduced tree mortality. This work provides a crucial improvement to the theoretical basis of the SPITFIRE model and a foundation upon which future model improvements may be built. In addition, this work further supports these model developments by  highlighting areas in the model where high amounts of uncertainty remain, based on new analysis and existing knowledge about the SPITFIRE model, and by identifying potential means of mitigating them to a greater extent."

In this work, we propose a statistical model to describe the most likely background level and the associated uncertainty in a network of dose rate detectors. We train, verify, and validate the model using real environmental data. Using the model, we show that we can correctly predict the background level in a subset of the detector network during a known anomalous event. 
 Detector networks that measure environmental radiation serve as radiological surveillance and early warning networks in many countries across Europe and beyond. Their goal is to detect anomalous radioactive signatures that indicate the release of radionuclides into the environment. Often, the background ambient dose equivalent rate H˙*(10) is predicted using meteorological information. However, in dense detector networks, the correlation between different detectors is expected to contain markedly more information. In this work, we investigate how the joint observations by neighbouring detectors can be leveraged to predict the background H˙*(10). Treating it as a stochastic vector, we show that its distribution can be approximated as multivariate normal. We reframe the question of background prediction as a Bayesian inference problem including priors and likelihood. Finally, we show that the conditional distribution can be used to make predictions. To perform the inferences we use PyMC. All inferences are performed using real data for the nuclear sites in Doel and Mol, Belgium. We validate our calibrated model on previously unseen data. Application of the model to a case with known anomalous behaviour – observations during the operation of Belgian Reactor 1 (BR1) in Mol – highlights the relevance of our method for anomaly detection and quantification."

Decline in density of symbionts caused mortality events in symbiotic organisms; however, giant clams appear to exhibit prior survival capacity against these detrimental effects. It remains unclear whether giant clams can mitigate the adverse impacts of bleaching. Herein, we found that bleaching events after chronic heat stress induce remarkable changes and remodeling in symbiotic tissue of the giant clam Tridacna crocea. The density and structure of unique muscle fibers with high collagen content, observed in siphonal mantle of these animals, were negatively altered after heat stress. These changes were associated with a metabolic shift from carbohydrates and fatty acids to amino acids as the breakdown of collagen-rich muscle fibers can partially compensate for energy loss during bleaching. Such a shift was proposed to be regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and FoxO-atrogin pathways. Overall, our study highlights a pro-survival mechanism in giant clams through plastic regulation, which likely contributes to their relatively high environmental resilience during bleaching."

A previously overlooked pathway for BP degradation and HO• formation was newly identified.

In contrast, excessive oxidative stress (600 ppm of NaClO) reduced bacteria and phage diversity, disrupted antioxidant responses, and increased microbial sensitivity. Hydraulic stress predominantly influenced viral diversity and co-occurrence network topology, favoring the expansion of broad host-range phages and lysogenic lifestyles under combined stresses. Phage–bacterium interaction analyses highlighted phages’ adaptive preferences for hosts with high network centrality and broad ecological niches, which enhanced microbial interactions and resilience. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated the early enrichment of genes associated with energy metabolism, ROS detoxification, and biofilm formation, followed by stabilization as biofilms matured. Phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes were involved in DNA repair, QS, and EPS biosynthesis, contributing to microbial adaptation through oxidative stress resistance and biofilm stabilization. Overall, these findings provide mechanistic insights into biofouling dynamics and highlight the need to optimize chlorine dosing to prevent suboptimal levels of microbial adaptation and biofouling."

Germicidal UV-C irradiation effectively inactivates spores suspended in water, yet information on surface spore mitigation is surprisingly absent. We show the effectiveness of 265–275 nm UV-C light to mitigateAspergillus nigeron nutrient-rich surfaces. UV-C mitigation of surface molds differs from inactivating spores suspended in water due to the unique characteristics of mycelial structures. Complete preinactivation of all viable cells during UV-C exposure is crucial to prevent mycelia formation; otherwise, even a single spore can gradually spread, covering surfaces by producing a progressive mycelial structure. A UV-C dose of 144 mJ/cm2 from 265 nm LEDs achieved complete preinactivation at lower concentrations (100–1000 CFU/plate), while higher concentrations required increased UV-C doses. Intermittent duty cycling of light delivery (10 min ON then 50 min OFF) at 275 nm delivered from side-emitting optical fibers achieved comparable mitigation to continuous irradiation. Insufficient UV-C exposure induced more resistant mycelial structures that shielded live spores beneath. This study highlights complete preinactivation of viable molds, or sustained inhibition by UV-C light, is more effective than UV-C posttreatment. Mycelial alteration triggered by sublethal stress helps spores to persist in unfavorable environments, where microbial control is the goal."

We analyzed the lung tissues for the first time and the intestinal contents of 11 dead finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis) to assess the intake of microplastics from prey and atmospheric sources. The lung tissues and intestinal contents contained average concentrations of 0.14 ± 0.11 MPs/g and 0.35 ± 0.36 MPs/g, respectively. Microplastics found in the lung tissues and intestinal contents were similar in physical characteristics (e.g., fragment shape, transparent to white color, and size <100 μm). On the other hand, they differed in the polymer types, with a higher proportion of epoxy-type microplastics in the lungs. Epoxy is a highly hazardous polymer according to the polymer hazard index, and in the present study, the lung tissues had a higher plastic hazard index than the intestinal contents. Hence, the respiratory system is more vulnerable to microplastic pollution from atmospheric sources than the digestive system is from water and food intake.

The results further point to food contact material and industrial processing as possible contamination sources. Compared with previous studies of ABFs, NPBFs generally showed higher contamination levels, leading to a higher dietary exposure in a vegan diet scenario. While the adult population is not at immediate risk following NPBF consumption, based on these results, a direct replacement of all ABFs with NPBFs is not recommended.

As filter-feeding organisms, marine mussels are particularly vulnerable to microplastics. Moreover, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are known to leach from microplastics under various environmental conditions. Among PAEs, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a common endocrine disruptor. We investigated the effects of microplastics and plasticizers on the reproductive function of the female mussel Mytilus coruscus. The results revealed that environmental exposure to DEHP and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) triggered molecular changes by allowing DEHP to act as an antiestrogen by binding with estrogen receptors (ER), thereby constituting the molecular initiating event. Key events were the suppression of ER, cytochrome P450–3 (CYP3), and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) gene expressions, which reduced estradiol and progesterone levels in ovarian tissues. Ultimately adverse outcomes occurred: antioxidant capacity in ovarian tissue was impaired, hindering ovarian development and reducing reproductive function. This study introduces a novel adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework focusing on reproductive impairment in shellfish. By integrating experimental findings with the AOP concept, the research provides essential data for understanding the toxicological effects of microplastic pollutants on mussels.

MCCP exposure induced chromatin condensation in the nucleus and mitochondria vacuolization of ovarian granulosa cells in rats and significantly increased the levels of serum gonadotropins and sex hormones, while reducing gonadotropin-releasing hormone levels. Transcriptomics analysis of ovaries revealed a predominant effect of MCCPs on the cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, and DNA damage repair pathways. Moreover, dual-omics integrative analysis indicated significant disturbance of steroid hormone biosynthesis caused by MCCPs, as well as amino acid metabolism related to TCA cycle. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that MCCP exposure disrupts intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and generates reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to DNA damage.

In spite of extensive research on homogeneous Hg0 oxidation, universal accurate prediction models and unified explanations are lacking. In this study, for the first time, quantitative prediction models were developed for the Hg0 oxidation percentage with machine learning (ML) using flue gas compositions and operating conditions as inputs. Gradient boosting regression models showed optimal performance (test R2 ≥ 0.85). ML-aided feature analysis results exhibited that Cl2, HCl, Hg0, temperature, and HBr were the top five critical factors affecting mercury homogeneous oxidation. Halogen gas promoted Hg0 oxidation at temperatures around 250 °C, while Hg0, SO2, and quench rates were not conducive to Hg0 oxidation.

In particular, we observe that the majority of indoor VOCs originate from unoccupied spaces, demonstrating temperature-dependent release from indoor surface reservoirs. The total indoor-to-outdoor VOC emission rates varied from 53 to 2300 mg day–1 (median 230 mg day–1) during unoccupied periods, influenced by both the air exchange rate and indoor temperature. Reanalysis of literature data from various building studies worldwide corroborates our findings and reveals that indoor-to-outdoor emissions scale with room volume, with an average emission rate of 0.33 ± 0.03 mg h–1 m–3. Our study implies that indoor-to-outdoor emissions significantly contribute to urban VOC levels, rivaling traditional urban sources, e.g., power generation and biomass burning.

We found that the land occupation of renewable energy infrastructure resulted in global biodiversity loss equivalent amounting to 19 × 10–4 global pdf in 2015. Severe biodiversity loss was concentrated primarily in densely populated and economically advanced countries, such as China, the United States, Brazil, India, Australia, Russia, and countries across Western Europe.

Through nontargeted screening, over 5000 features (ESI+) were initially detected, but our workflow’s prioritization based on androgenic activity prediction reduced the number of features requiring further analysis by over 95%, significantly streamlining the workload. In addition, the semiquantitative nontarget analysis allowed for the calculation of the contribution of an identified compound to the total activity of the sample without the need for reference standards. While this contribution was low (∼4.3%) and applicable to only one compound (1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione), it presents the first approach for calculating such contributions without relying on standards.

However, as a crucial component in high-performance PSCs, highly toxic lead may leak from discarded PSCs and cause environmental and health risks. Implementing the effective recovery of lead from discarded PSCs is crucial for the sustainable development of the PSC industry. Existing lead recovery methods commonly use toxic organic solvents as leaching reagents, i.e., dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, impeding the potential application of recycling technologies. This study proposes a facile ultrasonic water leaching technique for effectively recovering lead from the glass substrate of discarded PSCs. During the ultrasonic water leaching process, the perovskite layer undergoes rapid degradation, generating PbI2. Most of the PbI2 dissolves in the water, yielding a leaching solution containing a low lead concentration, while a minor fraction is converted into insoluble Pb(OH)I particles. The cumulative Pb removal ratio from the first two cycles of ultrasonic water leaching processes can reach 99.84%.

Yet, their environmental impact is likely increasing. This study examines emissions from a representative small turbofan engine on a Cessna Citation 560XL. It focuses on nonvolatile particulate matter (nvPM), gaseous pollutants, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Ground-level measurements were conducted using a standardized system with conventional Jet A-1 and a 30% blend of synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK). This sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend reduced the nvPM mass and number emission indices (EIs) by ∼35% and ∼20% at idle, with diminishing effects at higher thrust. Estimated nvPM number EIs at cruise decreased by ∼10%, suggesting a similar reduction in contrail ice particle concentrations at the predicted nvPM number EIs. While CO, HC, and NOx emissions remained unchanged, SO2 emissions decreased proportionally to the fuel sulfur content. VOC analysis showed lower emissions of complex unsaturated hydrocarbons. These findings highlight SAF’s potential to mitigate climate and air quality impacts. They also reveal discrepancies in estimated emissions from small turbofan engines and underscore limitations in existing models that predict fuel composition effects on nvPM emissions."

This approach allowed us to investigate the uptake coefficient of an isoprene-derived hydroxy–RO2, ISOPOO (HOC5H8OO·), onto deliquesced NaCl particles and the effect of transition metal ions (Fe2+ and Cu2+) on this uptake. We measured the uptake coefficients, γ, of ISOPOO on deliquesced NaCl particles doped with FeCl2 and CuCl2, each added at 5 wt % of NaCl, at 301 K and 84% relative humidity (RH). The results were 0.45 ± 0.01 for FeCl2 and 0.19 ± 0.01 for CuCl2. These values were 5 and 2 times greater than the uptake coefficient for deliquesced undoped NaCl particles, which was 0.09 ± 0.01. Preliminary simulation results for the western Japan domain, using a value of γ = 0.09 from a three-dimensional chemical transport model, indicate that the heterogeneous uptake of ISOPOO onto deliquesced particles contributed, on average, less than 3% of the ISOPOO loss process. This contribution increased to as much as 5% in remote forest and mountain areas during high PM2.5 events."

The safety of exposure to pesticides has raised concerns due to their presence in the environment and their potential effects on human health. The ovary is the major female reproductive organ and is considered a potential target organ for pesticide toxicity. This comprehensive Review examines the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on the ovary based on evidence from human biomonitoring, epidemiological studies, and toxicological studies. Epidemiological studies have shown that pesticide exposures are associated with early/delayed menarche, menstrual cycle disorders, early menopause, long time to pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, infertility, and implantation failure in women. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that exposure to pesticides disrupts the estrous cycle, reduces the follicle pool, alters hormone levels, and impairs oocyte maturation. Mechanisms of action of pesticides on ovarian function include effects on steroid receptors, hormone synthesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, epigenetic modifications, and signaling pathways. Gaps in knowledge and further research needs include prospective cohort studies with adequate sample sizes to elucidate the effects of different classes of pesticides (especially emerging insecticides, herbicides and fungicides) and mixture exposures on ovarian health, the development of effective toxicological models that can approximate or simulate realistic human exposure scenarios, and the translation of toxicological findings into measurable indicators that can be used in human health risk assessment. In summary, this Review aims to improve the understanding of the risk to women’s reproductive health from exposures to pesticides and to provide insights into strategies for preventing and managing reproductive health risks."

In this study, domestic chicken and environmental samples collected near a BFR manufacturing zone were analyzed to determine the bioaccumulation and transfer of HBCDs and TBBPA. The mean concentrations of ∑3HBCDs, TBBPA, ∑4TBBPA-related derivatives, ∑9TBBPA-related byproducts, and ∑16TBBPA-related transformation products in chicken tissues were 1207, 0.20, 15087, 0.96, and 6384 ng/g lipid weight, respectively. Exposure to sources of BFR contamination (soil, feed, and water) could be the main cause of high BFR levels in chickens. α-HBCD and bis-substituted TBBPA analogues have higher bioaccumulation factor levels than TBBPA and other compounds, indicating greater bioconcentration potential for substances with higher logKow. HBCDs, TBBPA, and TBBPA analogues tend to be enriched in the chicken comb and spleen and can cross the blood–brain barrier into the brain. However, while these compounds accumulate in the mother, they are also subject to metabolic processes that lead to their eventual excretion. Low-persistence BFRs were more favorable to maternal transfer, while compounds with high persistence tended to be retained in the mother. Although dietary intake of BFRs through chicken consumption poses a low risk to the general population, concerns remain regarding the synergistic risk of BFRs."

This study examined the impact of residential greenness on GWG and fetal intrauterine growth and assessed the mediating role of GWG. The research included 29406 births in Shanghai, utilizing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to measure greenness within a 500 m radius (NDVI-500). The analysis employed a generalized linear model to assess the impacts of residental greenness on GWG, fetal growth and birthweight, and a mediation analysis to explore GWG’s role between greenness and fetal development. Results indicated that significant benefits were observed with increased greenness, where each 0.1 unit increase in NDVI-500 was associated with reductions of 9.4% (95% CI: 5.5%–13.2%) in the risk of head circumference undergrowth and 8.5% (95% CI: 4.8%–12.2%) in estimated fetal weight undergrowth. Additionally, each 0.1 unit increase in NDVI-500 was associated with reductions of 9.4% (95% CI: 5.1%–13.5%) and 9.2% (95% CI: 6.2%–12.0%) in the risk  of inadequate and excessive GWG, respectively. Notably, total GWG mediated 17.5% of the relationship between NDVI-500 and the birth weight. These findings suggest that enhancing residential greenness could be an effective public health strategy to improve pregnancy outcomes by promoting fetal growth and managing GWG, with the GWG partially mediating these benefits."

We investigated concentrations of the EPA’s 16 high-priority PAHs on microplastics, particulate organic matter, and surface sediments. Additionally, the gastrointestinal tracts of three economically important fishes within the bay [Paralichthys lethostigma (n = 46), Sciaenops ocellatus (n = 47), and Cynoscion nebulosus (n = 85)] were examined for microplastics, while their liver and muscle tissue were analyzed for PAHs. In all  three matrices, the average concentration of ∑16PAHs ranged from 890.2 to 28,574.0 ng·g–1. The average individual PAH concentration in fish species ranged from 75.1 to 145.4 ng·g–1. Fish species in all of the sampling sites were classified between minimally and moderately polluted, with potential PAH bioaccumulation observed only in the southern flounder. About 67% of all of the analyzed sediment samples from Lavaca-Matagorda Bay indicate possible adverse or moderate adverse biological effects. This demonstrates the need for greater remediation of the existing pollution and continued monitoring of industrial discharges within Lavaca-Matagorda Bay to reduce harm to the ecosystem and the local economy."

Psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia. However, the associations among floods, psychiatric disorders, and dementia are still unclear. Using a population cohort from the UK Biobank, we aimed to investigate the mediating role of psychiatric disorders on the associations between floods and dementia. In this study, cumulative exposure to floods over an eight-year period preceding the study baseline was assessed for each participant at residential addresses. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to study the associations of flooding exposure with psychiatric disorders and dementia. Stratified analyses and mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether psychiatric disorders mediate the relationship between floods and dementia. During a median follow-up of 12.3 years (interquartile range: 11.6–13.0), 0.9% (2,028) of participants developed dementia and 9.5% (21,629) were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. The flooding exposure was associated with an 8.0% increased risk of incident dementia (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.080, 95% CI: 1.023–1.141). The flood–dementia association was observed to be partially mediated by several subtypes of psychiatric disorders (overall proportion of mediation: 75.7%), with psychotic disorder accounting for 49.7% (indirect effect HR: 1.039, 95% confidence interval: 1.015–1.064) of flood-related dementia, followed by stress-related disorder (proportion of mediation: 18.1%), and depression (proportion of mediation: 3.9%). This study provides evidence of an increased risk of dementia associated with exposure to floods, with psychiatric disorders playing a crucial mediating role in the flood-related dementia pathway. These findings suggest that flooding exposure is a critical risk factor for dementia, and targeted interventions addressing postdisaster mental health may be crucial for dementia prevention in affected populations."

However, the effect of BFRs on the development of atherosclerosis is currently unknown. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of three typical BFRs (BDE-47, BDE-209, and DBDPE) on the development of atherosclerosis and explored the underlying mechanisms using an in vitro cell model and ApoE–/– mice. Our data showed that BFRs significantly inhibited the viability of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and induced the generation of ROS. BFRs significantly enhanced the content of Ox-LDL in THP-1 macrophages, which promoted the formation of foam cells. In an in vivo study, BFRs exposure significantly increased the plaque area and lipid content in the aortic root of mice. BFRs significantly increased the ROS level in plaques and promoted the expression level of adhesion molecule ICAM-1, which enhanced the recruitment of macrophages. Transcriptome analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in signaling pathways related to oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. In summary, these results indicate that BFRs exposure can promote the development of atherosclerosis by increasing macrophage recruitment and foam cell formation, which elucidates the impact of BFRs on atherosclerosis for the first time, and provide scientific clues for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis."

Results showed a clear, dose-dependent reduction in viral genome copies with UVC exposure, where a dose of 129.9 mJ/cm2 reduced over 99% of the viral genome copies. Although less efficient, UVA still contributed to virus inactivation, reducing detectable phages to 20% at 513.30 J/cm2. Mucin provided a protective effect, making virus removal more challenging. Hydrogen peroxide enhanced disinfection, with 1.6 ppm reducing viral genome copies by 78%, and higher concentrations (up to 16 ppm) achieving over 99% reduction in the dark condition. The combination of UVA/UVC with H2O2 further enhanced disinfection, eliminating detectable virus genome copies entirely.

Secondary electrospray ionization high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS/MS) offers the highest coverage for detecting breath metabolites among current real-time breath analysis techniques. Although it has been generally recognized that metabolites in breath originate from the blood, a molecular-level understanding of the characteristics of metabolites in both breath and blood remains insufficient. In this study, nontargeted analyses of breath and blood samples from 11 healthy volunteers were performed using SESI-HRMS/MS and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS/MS), respectively. Tandem mass spectrometry was employed for metabolite annotation. Twenty-six breath-unique metabolites and 73 blood-unique metabolites were identified. Besides, seven metabolites were found in both breath and blood, including 7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1] heptane, levulinic acid, indole, pyroglutamic acid, malic acid, glutamic acid, and histidine. Intriguingly, the correlation of these metabolites between breath and blood was low (r < 0.4 or p > 0.05). Among all the confirmed metabolites, breath metabolites exhibit higher volatility according to their water–gas partition coefficient (log Pw/g) compared to blood metabolites. In addition, gender-derived differences in breath were significantly smaller than blood. In summary, this study indicates that breath metabolites are likely to offer complementary information on blood metabolites.

More than half of the soil and groundwater samples are considered to have moderate or high carcinogenic risk (CRT > 10–4), and 11 of the 95 groundwater samples are considered to have high health risk (HQT ≥ 1). The mobility of groundwater improves the migration possibility of PHCZs from enterprises to residential areas to induce direct toxic effects, and the high concentration and risk levels of PHCZs in agricultural and aquaculture areas at present may induce bioaccumulation in agricultural and sideline products; therefore, the occurrence of PHCZs in the environment deserves urgent concern."

Deaths Attributable to Unsafe Sanitation in Rural areas (DAUSRs) are influenced by demographic factors, disease mortality rates, and environmental sanitation conditions. However, most studies have been limited in scope and scale and lack a comprehensive evaluation framework for global DAUSRs. Therefore, this study estimated the global DAUSRs from 2000 to 2030, using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and the World Health Organization (WHO). We employed methods such as comparable risk assessment, Bayesian age (period) models, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Changes in the DAUSRs and their influencing factors were evaluated by applying a decomposition method to assess the impact of population dynamics, sanitation conditions, age structure, and disease mortality rates. The results indicated that despite improvements in rural sanitation, 12.2% of rural populations will still lack access to sanitary toilets in 2030, with an estimated 243,000 deaths (CI: 147,000–441,000) due to unsafe rural sanitation environments. This outcome highlights the need for better rural sanitation governance to provide for demographic shifts, such as aging and declining fertility rates, which are key drivers of DAUSRs. Regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia are at a higher risk with higher diarrhea-related mortality rates in rural areas. We suggest comprehensive measures, including enhancing rural medical facilities, improving sanitation infrastructure, and focusing on vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and children.

This study aims to investigate the reproductive and developmental toxicity of PFBA and PFNA by combined in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches. Examination of juvenile zebrafish exposed to PFBA at environmental concentrations by histopathology, sex hormone, and gene expression revealed accelerated development of zebrafish toward males, while exposure to PFNA during sex differentiation resulted in feminization. In accordance with the in vivo results, PFBA activated the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway, but PFNA inhibited it in both prostate cancer cell proliferation and luciferase reporter gene assays. Similarly, the differential binding mode of the two chemicals to AR was shown in the molecular docking analysis, with PFBA exhibiting higher potency for the agonist conformation and PFNA favoring the antagonistic conformation. Together, these results suggest that, while PFNA exhibited similar effects on sex differentiation and AR activity as PFOA, PFBA showed distinctive effects and deserves particular attention and further investigation."

Here, 51.20% of MPs were extracted from the original DF (samples denoted DF-O). After the subtracting procedure, MPs and their residual (DF-S samples) were divided into two parts. Our results indicated that the DF-O and MPs samples exhibited higher cytotoxicity, inflammatory, and oxidative stress levels than the DF-S samples did. The DF-O and MPs samples suppressed autophagy by decreasing expression levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3B), p-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K), phosphorylated AKT protein (p-Akt), and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) while increasing the level of p62. Meanwhile, DF-O and MPs samples induced apoptosis through increasing levels of Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 in Raw264.7 cells.

Here, we show that poly(lactic acid)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PLA/PBAT) films undergo ultraviolet photoaging, resulting in increased surface roughness and a higher quantity of MNPs on the surface. This aging process involves the generation of carbon- and oxygen-centered free radicals, chain scission, and the formation of oxidation products with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. These MNPs can be released under water shear force, significantly increasing the normalized mass loss of aged films to approximately 0.128 mg/cm2 (18 times higher than that of unaged films in water). In the gastrointestinal environment, the normalized mass loss further increases to about 0.196 mg/cm2 (28 times higher), likely due to potential enzymatic digestion and ion-swelling effects. These MNPs, primarily composed of PLA, are smaller and carry more negative charges under gastrointestinal conditions. In the THP-1 cell model, these MNPs affect cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. MNPs obtained through ultrafiltration, compared to those collected via centrifugation, display a broader size distribution and induce more pronounced toxicity in THP-1 cells, with an EC50 of 243 mg/L. Preliminary comparative analysis indicates that PLA/PBAT-derived MNPs present toxicity risks comparable to, or greater than, those of conventional plastic MNPs.

The 20th century, however, was bracketed by two extended pluvials that also had significant impacts in the region. We use a 1,224 years (800–2023 CE) record of observed and reconstructed soil moisture, in concert with a paleoclimate reanalysis product, to place the 20th‐century pluvials in a longer‐term context and investigate the occurrence and dynamics of similar events in the Common Era. Analyses of the soil moisture reconstruction demonstrate that pluvials and megapluvials are as ubiquitous as droughts and megadroughts over the last millennium. The early (19 years; 1905–1923) and late (22 years; 1978–1999) 20th‐century pluvials rank as the second and first wettest in the record, respectively, positioning these as events on par with the most extreme megadroughts. Pluvials show a strong association with tropical Pacific (warm) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the 20th century and over the prior millennium, though the role of the tropical Atlantic is much more uncertain and ambiguous. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach trained on the pre‐industrial period (800–1849 CE), we find that the record setting late 20th‐century megapluvial likely occurred as a consequence of anomalously strong Pacific sea surface temperature forcing. This work establishes pluvial and megapluvial events as intrinsic components of Common Era hydroclimate variability in SWNA, comparable in importance to droughts and megadroughts."

The size of volcanoes along the Hawai‘i–Emperor chain, and thus the magma flux of the Hawaiian plume, has varied over the past 85 million years. Fifteen and two million years ago, rapid bursts in magmatic production led to the emergence of large islands such as Pūhāhonu, Maui Nui and Hawai‘i, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we use new radiogenic Ce–Sr–Nd–Hf isotope data of Hawaiian shield lavas to quantify the composition and proportion of the different constituents of the Hawaiian plume over time. We find that most of the Hawaiian mantle source is peridotite that has experienced variable degrees of melt depletion before being incorporated into the plume. We show that the most isotopically enriched LOA‐type compositions arise from the aggregation of melts from more depleted, trace element‐starved peridotite, causing the over‐visibility of melts from recycled crust in the mixture. Our results also show that upwelling of chemically more depleted, and thus less dense, more buoyant mantle peridotite occurred synchronously to an observed burst of magma production. Buoyancy variations induced by variably depleted peridotite may not only control the temporal patterns of volcanic productivity in Hawai‘i, but also those of other plumes world‐wide. The excess buoyancy of depleted peridotite may therefore be an underrated driving force for convective mantle flow, trigger and sustain active upwelling of relatively cool plumes, and control the geometry of mantle upwellings from variable depths."

Using land surface models and water budget simulations, we examined the extent to which increased flow was driven by natural climate variability, anthropogenic climate trends, land‐use and land‐cover change (LULCC), and ecological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2. Natural climate variability (arising largely from coupled ocean‐atmosphere circulation systems in both the Pacific and North Atlantic) accounted for ∼765 m3 s−1 of the ∼900 m3 s−1 increase in flow since mid‐century, while anthropogenic climate trends negatively forced flow by increasing evapotranspiration more than precipitation. LULCC and elevated CO2 further increased simulated mean streamflow by ∼550 and ∼70 m3 s−1, respectively, relative to pre‐Industrial conditions and ∼100 and ∼65 m3 s−1 relative to mid‐20th century conditions. The LULCC effect was especially large in wet years, implying that current land cover is ill‐suited for buffering against extreme precipitation, likely in large part due to replacement of forest by cropland in the lower basin. Because increases in Missouri River flow over the past century were driven mostly by a recent (and likely transient) pluvial, our results suggest that flow in the basin could revert to a drier mean state when that pluvial ends, likely made worse by increased evaporative demand from anthropogenic warming."

Brittle tremor patches embedded in the ductile matrix deforming aseismically is the most common concept for the fault structure, but whether tremors and their patches impact the SSE initiation is under debate. This study focuses on 13 initiations of major Cascadia ETS. Limited observational constraints exist on the details of ETS initiation because spatiotemporal SSE inversions usually over‐smooth their temporal evolution. Scrutinizing tremors and SSE at the beginning of major ETS events gives us insights into their mechanical relationship. We directly retrieve the temporal evolution of the SSE moment by stacking sub‐daily Global Positioning System (GPS) time series at multiple sites, without slip inversions. Comparison of the GPS stack with tremor count demonstrates that SSE moment release accelerates drastically ∼ ${\sim} $1 day after the onset of vigorous tremor activity. On the other hand, once the SSE moment release accelerates, the tremor area expands more rapidly, suggesting that the growth of the ETS occurs through a feedback mechanism between slip and tremor once the SSE is well developed. By combining these and previous observations, we propose a conceptual model of ETS initiation: heterogeneous interface strength limits the growth of SSE with unruptured tremor patches acting as relatively high‐strength pins contributing to this heterogeneity. In other words, major ETS emerges probably only when collective tremor patches are critically stressed."

This study compares burned areas to climate and fuel conditions in three temperate regions: the desert, shrub, and forest ecoregions of western North America, west‐central Europe, and southwestern South America. In each region the mean annual aridity index (AI, precipitation over potential evapotranspiration) spans arid to humid climates. We examined how the fraction of area burned from 2001 to 2021 varied with mean annual AI, mean aboveground biomass, and land cover type distributions. All three regions had low fractions of area burned for the driest climate zones (AI < 0.5), a sign of fuel limitation to burned area. Fraction of area burned increased with mean aboveground biomass for these dry zones. Fraction of area burned peaked at intermediate AI (0.7–1.5) for all regions and declined again in the wettest climate zones (AI > 1.5), a sign of climate limitation to burned area. Of the three regions, western North America had the highest burned area, fraction of area burned, and fire sizes. Fragmentation of vegetation patches by the high Andes Mountains in southwestern South America and by intensive land use changes in west‐central Europe likely limited fire sizes.

Observational analysis shows that the extremely large accumulation of precipitation and long duration of this event are closely related to a slowly moving landfall typhoon “Dusuari” over North China due to the blocking effect of an anomalous high over the mid‐high latitude Asia. The anomalous southeasterly flow induced by the typhoon “Dusuari” and another typhoon “Khanun” over the East China Sea jointly built a highly efficient channel of water vapor supply from southern oceans toward North China. A water vapor budget analysis indicates that precipitation of this event is mainly caused by the dynamic process involving strong ascending motion. Accompanying strong water vapor transportation and convergence over North China, large amount of latent heat is released in the middle and the lower troposphere. The physical mechanisms of heavy rainfall‐induced diabatic heating in maintaining the precipitation over North China is further investigated using statistical analysis and numerical experiments. On one hand, the latent heating released by heavy rainfall induces significant uplifting flows which causes more precipitation. On the other hand, the heavy rainfall‐induced diabatic heating contributes to the enhancement of the westward extension of high‐pressure dam over mid‐high latitude through a regional meridional circulation. This strengthened high‐pressure dam sustained the cyclonic circulation of “Dusuari” over North China, leading to continuous heavy rainfall there."

Compared to traditional optimization algorithms, the deep learning‐based optimization framework, namely differentiable parameter learning (dPL), reduces computational costs and achieves greater spatial generalizability. However, the effectiveness of the parameter values derived from dPL in enhancing land surface modeling needs further verification. This study introduced a deep learning‐based adaptive parameter learning (APL) framework for efficiently optimizing key parameters in the Common Land Model (CoLM) to simulate high‐resolution soil moisture (SM) across Northeast China. We began by constructing a surrogate model using long short‐term memory networks to capture the relationships between CoLM parameters, meteorological forcing data, and simulated SM. Initial parameter optimization using the dPL framework improved SM simulations but revealed discrepancies between the performances of surrogate and process‐based models. The APL framework builds upon dPL by iteratively refining surrogate models with expanded training data sets enhancing their ability to approximate the behavior of process‐based models. Evaluations using four metrics—bias, root mean square error, correlation, and Kling–Gupta efficiency—demonstrated that APL outperformed dPL with both frameworks providing robust parameter estimates. This study underscored the potential of deep learning‐based parameter optimization frameworks to overcome traditional calibration challenges in LSMs by improving computational efficiency, enhancing spatial consistency and increasing resilience to uncertainties in forcing and reference data. Finally, we recommended that improving physical coherence in LSMs should not rely solely on adjusting a few parameters but requires a comprehensive approach, including identifying key parameters, employing multiobjective parameter optimization, and, critically, utilizing high‐precision land surface benchmarking data sets."

Various sensibility tests are conducted, including the replacement of soil property, surface drag coefficient scheme, canopy stomatal resistance scheme, soil surface resistance scheme, and their different combinations. The results indicate that different schemes can improve certain aspects of model simulations. Specifically, the modified surface drag coefficient scheme reduces the overestimation in sensible heat flux by adjusting the surface heat exchange coefficient, while the improved stomatal and soil resistance schemes enhance latent heat flux and soil moisture simulations. The optimal combination significantly reduces average bias by 61.3% for the Bowen ratio, 9.6% for soil temperature, and 50.0% for soil moisture. Regional simulations demonstrate that sensible heat flux constitutes the primary constituent within the energy partitioning, characterized by a mean Bowen ratio of 1.84.

This study aims to provide an updated analysis of the hemispheric asymmetry of stratospheric water vapor (SWV) for the period from 2000 to 2020 based on merged satellite data set and Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) simulations driven by ERA5. Over post‐2000 decades, significant changes were identified in comparison to the pre‐2000 period, notably a reversal in the SWV difference between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, particularly in the midlatitudes. This shift is largely attributed to a slowdown in the deep branch of Brewer‐Dobson circulation (BDC) in the Northern Hemisphere relative to the Southern Hemisphere after about year 2000. The cooling‐induced dehydration is the primary driver of the significantly lower SWV values in the Antarctic stratosphere than the Arctic stratosphere. This asymmetry increased before 2000 at a rate of 0.1–0.2 ppmv per decade. After 2000, however, this difference has decreased, primarily due to ozone recovery in the Southern Hemisphere, despite the enhanced northward transport of water vapor driven by the changes in the BDC.

To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate how extreme precipitation of varying durations responds to urbanization, accounting for natural climate variations. We classified the urban agglomeration of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in East China into nine distinct groups based on seasonal extreme precipitation patterns, utilizing structural self‐organizing maps (SOM), and explored the relationship between urbanization and extreme precipitation with Geographical Detector Model. The results revealed substantial seasonal precipitation fluctuations within the YRD, showing significant spatial variability and underscoring the importance of considering natural climate variations in urban extreme precipitation studies. After accounting for natural climate variations, our findings unveiled a notable urbanization‐induced precipitation effect, particularly prominent during summer and autumn. Additionally, urbanization's influence on extreme precipitation demonstrated a significant time‐scaling effect, with shorter‐duration events exhibiting a stronger correlation with urbanization. Furthermore, the interaction between urbanization and elevation surpassed the impact of individual factors, intensifying as event duration decreased, especially for durations less than 3 days, indicating a more complex mechanism for their influence on extreme precipitation.

To partially solve this issue, this study adopts an improved SCF scheme that adequately consider the impact of sub‐grid terrain relief on snow cover into the Regional Climate Model version 4.7 (RegCM4.7) coupled with the CLM4.5 land surface model to enhance the model skill. Results show that adopting the improved SCF scheme in RegCM4.7 model can significantly reduce the SCF overestimation on the TP produced by the original model, leading to obvious improvements in the surface albedo, soil and surface air temperature simulations in cold seasons. Mechanism analysis indicates that the sub‐grid terrain relief suppresses the rapid increase of SCF with snowfall and makes the ground more difficult to be fully covered by snow, resulting in the overestimation of SCF obviously reduced and thereafter the surface albedo decreased. It further causes the ground surface to absorb more solar radiation and then more heat released to the overlying atmosphere and deep soils. Thereafter, the cold biases in the soil and surface air temperature simulations on the TP in cold seasons can be clearly reduced. This study highlights that considering the impact of the sub‐grid topography relief on snow cover in numerical models is one of the effective ways for reducing the cold biases on the TP."

This misalignment introduces spatial and temporal complexity into cyclone‐sea ice interactions. To gain deeper insights, we apply cyclone tracking to identify cyclones near the sea ice edge and examine both their characteristics and the sea ice's response. Our analysis reveals a significant increase in the frequency of these cyclones across most subregions of the Southern Ocean. To quantify their impact, we introduce an exposure index that encompasses cyclone intensity, local sea ice concentration (SIC), and interaction duration to identify key seasons and regions of cyclone‐ice interactions. Furthermore, categorizing cyclones by SIC anomalies reveals that cyclone strength and moving direction are primary drivers of SIC variability. In particular, composite analyses highlight surface temperature advection and sensible heat flux as critical mechanisms linking cyclone circulation to SIC anomalies. These findings highlight the role of cyclones in driving short‐term sea ice variability, offering new insights into Antarctic climate system feedbacks."

Jacob,Global Rice Paddy Inventory (GRPI): A High‐Resolution Inventory of Methane Emissions From Rice Agriculture Based on Landsat Satellite Inundation Data,"Rice agriculture is a major source of atmospheric methane, but current emission inventories are highly uncertain, mostly due to poor rice‐specific inundation data. Inversions of atmospheric methane observations can help to better quantify rice emissions but require high‐resolution prior information on the location and timing of emissions. Here we use Landsat satellite data at 30 m resolution to map the global monthly distribution of rice paddy fractional areas on a 0.1° × 0.1° (∼10 × 10 km) grid by optimizing an algorithm for flooded vegetation and combining it with a 30 m global cropland database and rice‐specific data. We validate this global rice paddy map with an independent US rice database and with seasonal flux measurements from the FLUXNET CH4 network, estimating errors on rice area fraction of 31% on the 0.1° × 0.1° grid and 10% regionally. We combine the rice paddy map with an extensive global data set of emission factors (EFs) per unit of rice paddy area. The resulting Global Rice Paddy Inventory (GRPI) provides methane emission estimates at 0.1° × 0.1° (∼10 × 10 km) spatial resolution and monthly resolution. Our global emission of 39.3 ± 4.7 Tg a−1 for 2022 (best estimate and error standard deviation) is higher than previous inventories that use outdated rice maps and IPCC‐recommended EFs now considered to be too low. China is the largest rice emitter in GRPI (8.2 ± 1.0 Tg a−1), followed by India (6.5 ± 1.0 Tg a−1), Bangladesh (5.7 ± 1.2 Tg a−1), Vietnam (5.7 ± 1.0 Tg a−1), and Thailand (4.4 ± 0.9 Tg a−1). These five countries together account for 78% of global total rice emissions. Seasonality of emissions varies considerably between and within individual countries reflecting differences in climate and crop practices. We define a rice methane intensity (methane emission per unit of rice produced) to assess the potential of mitigating methane emission without compromising food security. We find national methane intensities ranging from 10 to 120 kg methane per ton of rice produced (global mean 51) for major rice‐growing countries. Countries can achieve low intensities with high‐yield cultivars, upland rice agriculture, water management, and organic matter management."

 Indian summer monsoon (ISM) hydrology fuels biogeochemical cycling across South Asia and the Indian Ocean, exerting a first-order control on food security in Earth’s most densely populated areas. Although the ISM is projected to intensify under continued greenhouse forcing, substantial uncertainty surrounds anticipating its impacts on future Indian Ocean stratification and primary production—processes key to the health of already-declining fisheries in the region. Here we present century-scale records of ISM runoff variability and marine biogeochemical impacts in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) since the Last Glacial Maximum (∼21 thousand years ago (ka)). These records reveal extreme monsoon states relative to modern strength, with weakest ISM intensity during Heinrich Stadial 1 (∼17.5–15.5 ka) and strongest during the early Holocene (∼10.5–9.5 ka). Counterintuitively, we find that BoB productivity collapsed during both extreme states of peak monsoon excess and deficits—both due to upper-ocean stratification. Our findings point to the possibility of future declines in BoB primary productivity under a strengthening and more variable ISM regime.

 Bedrock composition, in particular the proportion of carbonate, can influence the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and also the carbonate chemistry of rivers, but its effects on the nitrogen cycle in rivers are usually overlooked. Here we present geochemical composition measurements of rivers across the Pearl River Basin in China that show that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is positively correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen and follows the variation in solar radiation in the carbonate-dominated region during the wet season, but not in the non-carbonate-dominated region. In situ incubations show that organic nitrogen production is strengthened in the regions with high dissolved inorganic carbon and high temperature and solar radiation. DON zonation in the dry season is not obvious owing to the limitation of low temperature on nitrogen assimilation. We also report a similar DON contrast in carbonate-dominated and non-carbonate-dominated regions in Malang in Indonesia. Furthermore, from an analysis of global published data, we find that a modified Michaelis–Menten model incorporating carbon limitation provides a much better fit to the global latitudinal distribution of DON globally. Hence, we propose that carbonate weathering enhancement of organic nitrogen production occurs ubiquitously. Dissolved inorganic carbon can be a limiting factor for organic nitrogen production in rivers, and so bedrock composition may influence river chemistry, according to geochemical analysis of rivers in Asia and statistical analysis of global datasets."

 The dynamic interplay between microbial communities and sediment transport shapes continental landscapes and influences particulate matter fluxes across the Earth’s surface. Microbial colonization transforms individual sediment grains into aggregates with intricate and varied morphologies, complicating sediment transport. However, current models often simplify this morphological complexity, assuming that aggregates experience fluid drag equal to that of smooth spheres or idealized shapes. Here we apply an X-ray micro-computed tomography method combined with computational fluid dynamics simulations to analyse aggregate morphology at high spatial resolution and determine the relationship with drag. Instead of aggregate size or gross shape being the primary controls on drag, we find that microbial colonization alters the fine-scale aggregate morphology and increases drag by factors of 1–3 compared with smooth surfaces. We propose a morphology-corrected drag law that accounts for this complexity, reconciling the differences in drag across diverse aggregates. Our findings suggest that a shift from focusing on gross scale variabilities (size or gross shape) to fine-scale morphologies could enable greater accuracy in transport predictions, and improve understanding of microbially colonized aggregates in fluvial, coastal and oceanic systems.

Here, the authors propose an efficient coding principle for reinforcement learning, whereby agents use compact representations, enabling human-like generalization. 
 Reinforcement learning theory explains human behavior as driven by the goal of maximizing reward. Conventional approaches, however, offer limited insights into how people generalize from past experiences to new situations. Here, we propose refining the classical reinforcement learning framework by incorporating an efficient coding principle, which emphasizes maximizing reward using the simplest necessary representations. This refined framework predicts that intelligent agents, constrained by simpler representations, will inevitably: 1) distill environmental stimuli into fewer, abstract internal states, and 2) detect and utilize rewarding environmental features. Consequently, complex stimuli are mapped to compact representations, forming the foundation for generalization. We tested this idea in two experiments that examined human generalization. Our findings reveal that while conventional models fall short in generalization, models incorporating efficient coding achieve human-level performance. We argue that the classical RL objective, augmented with efficient coding, represents a more comprehensive computational framework for understanding human behavior in both learning and generalization. Reinforcement learning models of human behavior are limited in explaining the capacity for generalization.

Here, the authors show that through femtosecond ultraviolet excitation they can active a parity-forbidden dark exciton. 
 As conventional electronic materials approach their physical limits, the application of ultrafast optical fields to access transient states of matter captures imagination. The inversion symmetry governs the optical parity selection rule, differentiating between accessible and inaccessible states of matter. To circumvent parity-forbidden transitions, the common practice is to break the inversion symmetry by material design or external fields. Here we report how the application of femtosecond ultraviolet pulses can energize a parity-forbidden dark exciton state in black phosphorus while maintaining its intrinsic material symmetry. Unlike its conventional bandgap absorption in visible-to-infrared, femtosecond ultraviolet excitation turns on efficient Coulomb scattering, promoting carrier multiplication and electronic heating to ~3000 K, and consequently populating its parity-forbidden states. Interferometric time- and angle-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy reveals dark exciton dynamics of black phosphorus on ~100 fs time scale and its anisotropic wavefunctions in energy-momentum space, illuminating its potential applications in optoelectronics and photochemistry under ultraviolet optical excitation.

 Testicular fetal Leydig cells produce androgens essential for male reproductive development. Impaired fetal Leydig cell differentiation leads to differences of sex development including hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and infertility. Despite fetal Leydig cells are thought to originate from proliferating progenitor cells in the testis interstitium, the precise mechanisms governing the interstitial cells to fetal Leydig cell transition remain elusive. Using mouse models and single-nucleus multiomics, we find that fetal Leydig cells arise from a Nr2f2-positive interstitial population. Embryonic deletion of Nr2f2 in mouse testes results in differences of sex development, including dysgenic testes, Leydig cell hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, and hypospadias. By combining single-nucleus multiomics and NR2F2 ChIP-seq we find that NR2F2 promotes the progenitor fate while suppresses Leydig cell differentiation by modulating key transcription factors and downstream genes. Our findings establish Nr2f2 as a crucial regulator of fetal Leydig cell differentiation and provide molecular insights into differences of sex development linked to Nr2f2 mutations.

Here, the authors proposed elastic-wave circulator that could achieve this without breaking reciprocity, enabling mode transition and wave trapping concurrently. 
 Nonreciprocal transmission of waves is highly desirable for the transport and redistribution of energy. However, building an asymmetric system to break time-reversal symmetry is relatively difficult because it tends to work under stringent guidelines, narrow bandwidth, or external impetus, particularly in a three-port system. Without breaking reciprocity, realizing “one-way” transmission of elastic waves by a linear and passive structure in a higher-dimensional asymmetric system, such as a three-port circulator, poses quite a challenge. Here, based on the wave-vector modulation mechanism, we propose an elastic-wave circulator that achieves this without breaking reciprocity, enabling perfect mode transition and wave trapping simultaneously. Requiring neither activated media nor relying on the nonlinearity of nonreciprocal devices, the circulator routes elastic waves purely in a clockwise direction, offering superior performance in broad bandwidth, robust behavior, and simple configuration. Our study provides a feasible platform for asymmetric wave transport in a three-port system, which can be useful in the routing, isolation, and harvesting of energy and can also be extended to other fields, such as electromagnetic and acoustic waves.

 Chilling stress is one of the major environmental stresses that restrains plant development and growth. Our previous study showed that a potential iron sensor BTS (BRUTUS) was involved in temperature response in Arabidopsis plants. However, whether plant iron homeostasis is involved in plant response to temperature fluctuation is not known. In this study, we discover that BTS mutant bts-2 is sensitive to chilling stress, and the sensitivity is attributed to the accumulation of iron. The suppressor screening of bts-2 led to the discovery of RH24, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, that fully suppresses bts-2 chilling sensitivity. RH24 is accumulated under low temperatures, where it unwinds the iron regulator ILR3 (IAA-leucine resistant 3) mRNA and increases the ILR3 protein levels. Intriguingly, RH24 sequesters ILR3 in phase-separated condensates to reduce ILR3-mediated iron overload, and BTS or cold treatments further facilitated the condensate formation. Therefore, RH24 and BTS coordinately control ILR3 to reduce iron uptake under chilling stress. Our findings reveal that the RNA helicase RH24 and BTS finetunes ILR3 to maintain plant iron homeostasis in response to temperature fluctuations.

 The preservation of fossils in the rock record depends on complex redox processes. Redox conditions around different decaying organisms have rarely been monitored in the context of experimental taphonomy. Here, microsensors were used to measure redox changes around decomposing carcasses of various taxa, including shrimp, snail, starfish, and planarian. Our results show that different decaying taxa lead to various post-mortem environmental redox conditions. Large carcasses tend to reach reducing conditions more rapidly than smaller ones. However, size does not explain all observed patterns, as environmental redox conditions are also influenced by the nature of the organic material. For instance, taxa with higher proteins-to-lipids and (proteins + carbohydrates)-to-lipids ratios tend to achieve reducing conditions more rapidly than others. The generation of distinct redox environments around different taxa originally put under the same original environmental conditions suggests that various fossilisation patterns of macrofossils and molecules can co-occur within a single sedimentary layer.

 Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a worldwide environmental and human health problem, stressing the urgent need for a reliable forecasting tool.

Using eXplainable AI (XAI) methods, we identify the contributions of each variable to ENSO predictability.

 The Holocene Thermal Maximum has been considered an analog for near-future climate. Terrestrial records show that this period culminated in Southwest Greenland with the Greenland Ice Sheet retreating behind its present-day position. However, there is a paucity of Holocene coastal marine records proximal to the ice sheet from which to infer marine conditions. Here we present a multi-proxy record from Nuup Kangerlua covering the past ~10,500 years, supported by a one-year sediment trap time-series. We infer modern sea-surface conditions comparable to those following the fjord’s deglaciation from 10,000 to 8000 calibrated years before present. Warmer temperatures led to a period of pronounced meltwater discharge and peak marine productivity by 7500 calibrated years before present.

 We developed an ET model, namely the Enhanced and Spatial-Temporal Improvement of MODIS EvapoTranspiration (ESTIMET), for local-to-regional ET monitoring and applications in the tropics, based on the original MOD16 evapotranspiration (ET) algorithm. The main distinguishing features of ESTIMET are providing a near-real-time product with increased spatial (from 500 to 250 m) and temporal (from 8-day to daily) resolutions, minimising gaps in cloud cover and adjusting specific tropical characteristics of diverse vegetation and microclimate types. We compared the results of ESTIMET with the MOD16A2GF, PML_V2, and GLEAM 4.1a ET products, using eddy covariance (EC) data from 14 sites in Brazil, as well as the water balance-based annual ET in 25 Brazilian catchments. Overall, the ESTIMET estimates captured the daily seasonal variations of the EC data, especially in the Caatinga, Pantanal, and Cerrado biomes, with concordance correlation coefficients (ρc) ranging from 0.45 to 0.80 at eight sites located in these three biomes. The comparisons of the 8-day cumulative ET show that the ESTIMET algorithm exhibits a mean ρc of 0.63, greater than that of MOD16A2GF (ρc = 0.58), GLEAM 4.1a (ρc = 0.47), and PML_V2 (ρc = 0.45). Similarly, for the catchment water balance, ESTIMET exhibits a better representation of annual ET than other ET products in the three major South American biomes, i.e. the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado, which cover over 85 % of the Brazilian territory. Thus, ESTIMET improves remote sensing-based ET estimates in tropical biomes, operating at a finer spatiotemporal scale and latency (i.e. monthly) under all sky conditions."

 Accurate tree species distribution is essential for biodiversity assessment, sustainable forest management, and environmental policy. However, mapping species over large areas with satellite data is challenging due to spectral mixing and complex spatial distribution. To address this, we developed a novel deep learning model, ForestFormer, using Sentinel-2 time series data to map eight dominant tree species in Germany. ForestFormer’s dual-branch network with spectral and spatial attention modules improves classification by highlighting species-specific characteristics. Cross-validation in 2,364 National Forest Inventory plots shows that ForestFormer achieves species classification accuracy ranging from 69% to 92%, with an average accuracy of 84%, outperforming existing baseline methods. The developed ForestFormer model can help generate a large-scale and reliable tree species map for Germany, which in turn provides crucial insights into the diverse characteristics of tree species to support forest management. Our analysis of results shows that Pine is the species most resistant to disturbances, while Douglas fir is the least. Northeastern regions of Germany exhibit particularly low levels of forest biodiversity, especially in the states of Brandenburg and Berlin, followed by neighboring states such as Sachsen–Anhalt, Mecklenburg–Vorpommern, Sachsen, and Niedersachsen. In addition, climatic factors, especially water deficit, are shown to play a very important role in determining tree species distribution patterns, followed by topographic and soil factors. These findings are anticipated to provide a critical basis for environmental policy formulation, particularly in forest management strategies responding to ongoing climate change."

 Mapping crop types with remote sensing imagery is crucial for timely acquisition of crop planting information. However, large-scale crop type mapping is often hindered by the absence of ground truth data and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of available cloud-free optical images. In this study, the conception of daily crop-wise indicative features (DCIF) was proposed for automatic crop mapping to address this issue. Crop-wise indicative feature (CIF) was defined as a comprehensive feature that can distinctly differentiates the target crop and all other classes, with the CIF value showing a polarization trend with target crop close to 1 and others close to 0. Logistic Regression (LR) model was utilized to learn CIF of target crop on each single date, referred to as CIF extractor. The time series analysis method (i.e., seasonal trend decomposition) and imputation method was then utilized for the discrete time series of CIF extractors, which were separately trained based on training samples on each day. This process yielded the DCIF extractor that can capture the unique feature pattern on any given day during the entire growing period. The comprehensive features produced by DCIF extractor later served as the input of Otsu algorithm to automatic distinguish target crop from other crops. Our results in Heilongjiang, China, Iowa, USA, and Bas-Rhin, France show that the DCIF extractor effectively overcomes abovementioned challenges in crop mapping by applying time series analysis method at model-level. The overall accuracy exceeded 90 % in Heilongjiang and Iowa for both 2021 and 2022. In Bas-Rhin, where fragmented land parcels and uneven crop distribution are prevalent, the overall accuracy surpassed 87 %.

 Dust is one of the key factors influencing photovoltaic (PV) power generation. The ability to accurately capture PV dust information is essential for PV operation and sustainable utilization. This study employs uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imaging to monitor PV dust deposition. To address the problems of information redundancy in hyperspectral data and the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) easily falling into local optimum, a high-precision UAV hyperspectral PV dust estimation method is proposed.

The results show that FOD improves the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and the 0.2 order STSO-BPNN model achieves higher accuracy (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.79 g/m2, RPIQ = 7.98).

 High-quality, full-coverage topographic bathymetric data is crucial for marine economic development and ecological environment protection. Due to the complex environment of land-sea transition zone, it is challenging to acquire comprehensive bathymetric topography using a single sensor. Multiplatform topographic bathymetric technology, such as airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) and multibeam echo sounding (MBES), whose point clouds can be integrated to construct a complete model of land-sea transition zone. However, point cloud data from different sources may have certain differences in the digital description of the same target. Meanwhile, affected by factors such as registration error and sensor system error, there are data gaps in the registered point cloud, which hinders the subsequent reconstruction. To overcome these problems, a fusion method combining a pseudo-grid model is proposed to construct a high-quality, seamless topographic-bathymetric map. This paper’s contribution identifies non-overlapping ALB regions and generates anti-noise MBES simulated points (SPs) by constructing a pseudo-grid. Moreover, this paper focuses on establishing a point-to-SP model to eliminate the gaps and reduce the impact of registration errors on the fusion accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, four typical samples along with six reference samples exhibiting diverse features collected from Ganquan Island in the South China Sea are utilized in the experiment. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve ideal results in terms of the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the six reference samples, which is reduced from 0.41 m to 0.19 m.

 Water depth (H), bottom reflectance (Rbλ), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) and seawater transparency (SDD) are key parameters in assessing shallow benthic habitats. However, due to limited in-situ data, restricted hyperspectral imagery or dynamic water quality, it is challenging to develop a generalized remote sensing model for decoupling water column and benthic signals across diverse regions and time periods. In this study, a Modified Log rotation Ratio and Semi-analytical (MLR-S) model is proposed for diffuse attenuation coefficient Kdλ retrieval by adjusting inherent optical properties (P, G, X), from widely used four-band multispectral images without relying on truth data. A new Binary Quadratic Polynomial Relationship (BQPR) between P and the logarithmic values of blue-green bands was developed upon a sparse set of self-inferred points (SIPs). Then, large-scale and optimal Kdλ was determined. Finally, using the monthly mean water column reflectance dataset MMCRwλ constructed from 23-year MODIS data, Rbλ, Chl and SDD can be efficiently derived. Synchronous validation at Dazhou Island confirmed the effectiveness of the MLR-S model, with mean relative errors of 23.77%, 15.26% and 9.91% for blue, green and red Rb, respectively, and 36.69% for Chl. Further validation of Rbλ in Heron Reef, Aitutaki Island and Buck Island demonstrated the model’s robustness across diverse habitats. Compared to the ICESat-2 Along Track Benthic Reflectance (ATBR) model, the MLR-S model yielded more reasonable and reliable Rbλ in deeper waters. Additionally, it outperformed the traditional semi-analytical model, achieving greater accuracy while being over 100 times more computationally efficient. This model offers promising potential for large-scale, high-resolution monitoring of benthic habitats using four-band multispectral data, supporting improved understanding of reef health and informed decision-making."

 Mapping environmental variables is crucial for natural resource management. Researchers and scholars have continually advanced this field with modern techniques such as Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), Deep Learning (DL), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) models. While effective, these models often present a significant challenge due to their black nature, which obscures the process of generating final maps from raw data. Recent theoretical breakthroughs have shown that white/grey-box models can achieve the same level of accuracy as these advanced techniques, debunking the belief that complex models are necessarily the most accurate. Based on these findings, we have developed a methodology that employs a series of statistical tests and data analytics to identify essential features hidden in spatial data in order to assess the predictive model (of white/grey kind) that best approximates underlying spatial processes. This methodology profiles the model that better adapts to the data, aiding in the selection of the simplest model that achieves the desired accuracy, functioning similarly to a recommender system for model selection. Furthermore, the set of permissible models includes only regressive-like ones to clarify the data’s contribution to map construction and can be applied to a wide range of datasets. By reducing complexity, this approach enhances the transparency of the model’s results. Real-world dataset demonstrates this methodology’s remarkable ability to produce highly accurate results."

 Mapping forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for monitoring forest ecosystems and assessing the success of conservation initiatives such as the REDD + carbon projects. Traditional field-based approaches to measuring AGB, however, face significant challenges, due to high financial costs and logistical constraints. Remote sensing, including both active and passive sensors, presents a promising and cost-effective alternative, yet its practical utility and accuracy for capturing forest AGB in diverse and complex ecosystems remains largely unexplored. This research used an extensive national forest inventory (NFI) dataset to evaluate the ability to map the AGB of the Miombo woodlands in Zambia across four agro-ecological zones using both multi-seasonal SAR (Sentinel-1A) and optical (Landsat-8 OLI) imagery. A multi-level experiment was designed to (i) compare the accuracy of AGB estimation using SAR and optical data when used independently, and in combination, using a Random Forest regression model, (ii) assess the effect of seasonality on the accuracy of AGB estimation when using SAR and optical datasets, and (iii) evaluate the effect of variation in climatic and environmental conditions on AGB estimation. Experimental results show that multi-seasonal images (across the rainy, hot and dry seasons) outperformed single-season and annual images. Combining SAR backscatter in the hot season, optical bands in the dry season, and vegetation indices in the hot season produced the most accurate AGB model (R = 0.69, MAE = 14.01 Mg ha−1 and RMSE = 18.23 Mg ha−1). The models performed distinctly across different agro-ecological zones (R = 0.44 – 0.79), suggesting that fitting local models could be beneficial. These results based on the extensive NFI of Zambia demonstrate that seasonal effects and fitting local models can lead to more accurate AGB estimation within the Miombo woodlands, which is of significance for ongoing REDD + carbon projects in Zambia and other African countries."

 Validating forest cover maps is essential for evidence-based conservation and sustaining ecosystem services. However, complex spatial patterns in fragmented tropical forest landscapes—often comprising non-contiguous forest patches, interspersed with agricultural lands and other land cover types—pose considerable difficulties for accuracy assessment using conventional techniques. To address this, we developed an integrated object-based sampling (IOBS) method that combines stratified random sampling, proportional allocation, and sample distance optimization. The IOBS method was applied to assess the accuracy of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) global 25 m PALSAR-2/PALSAR forest/non-forest (FNF) 2020 map across 14 ecoregions in Nigeria. Its performance was compared to simple random, systematic, and stratified random sampling using the coefficient of variation (CV), heterogeneity index (HI), and true accuracy metrics. IOBS demonstrated substantially higher spatial variability (CV = 109.37) and heterogeneity (HI = 0.21) compared to other methods (CV = 28.84–53.93, HI = 0.05–0.11). The IOBS estimated an accuracy of 81.1 %, closely aligning with the true accuracy of 82.4 % and outperforming other methods (75.3 %–79.7 %). The higher performance of IOBS stems from its ability to capture a broad range of forest conditions—from extensive contiguous cover to small, fragmented patches—while minimizing spatial autocorrelation through distance optimization. By better representing local heterogeneity, IOBS offers a robust and precise framework for validating categorical forest cover maps in complex tropical landscapes, advancing accuracy assessment practices for remote sensing applications."

 Remote sensing scene captioning is crucial for the deep understanding and intelligent analysis of Earth observation data. Many existing methods and datasets lack a fine-grained description of key geographical elements, fail to capture the full diversity of spatial relations, and are limited in their applicability to real-world geospatial scenarios. To address these shortcomings, we propose HI4HC (hybrid intelligence for remote sensing scene hierarchical captioning), a novel method that combines deep learning algorithms with expert knowledge to generate hierarchical captions for remote sensing scenes. This approach comprehensively describes scenes across three dimensions: geographical elements, spatial relations, and scene concepts, resulting in more accurate, detailed, and comprehensive captions. Leveraging HI4HC, we have constructed and made public a high-quality hierarchical caption dataset named AAAAD (adopt-amend-annihilate-add dataset). Extensive experiments show that AAAAD outperforms traditional single-level caption datasets in terms of the richness of geographical elements, the precision of spatial relations, and overall caption diversity, with improvements observed across 11 out of 13 evaluation metrics. Moreover, the hierarchical captions generated by HI4HC offer users the flexibility to organize information according to specific application needs such as imagery classification, change detection, multimodal understanding and cross-modal retrieval.

To address these limitations, this study developed an NDVI time-series prediction optimization model, LSKRX, which integrates multiple machine learning algorithms with local geographic and climatic data. Using the Southwest Basin of China as a case study, dominant climatic factors were identified through sub-basin analysis, and machine learning models were constructed to link NDVI with these factors. The LSKRX model demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to single-model approaches, with the most notable enhancement in BIAS. Spatially, the model’s predictions aligned closely with observed values, particularly in the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. The model performed exceptionally well in winter (CC: 0.964) and summer (CC: 0.918) and achieved optimal accuracy in alpine regions at altitudes of 4000–5000 m (CC: 0.900). By leveraging the strengths of multiple machine learning models, the LSKRX model enhances NDVI prediction reliability under complex mountainous and alpine conditions, providing a robust tool for precise ecological assessment and management."

 High-resolution maps of climate and ecosystem variables are essential for supporting terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes estimation, climate change mitigation, and ecosystem degradation assessment. These maps are usually created using remotely sensed data obtained from various types of imagery and sensors. The remote sensing data typically serve as covariates to deliver spatially explicit information using machine learning algorithms. Often the uncertainty associated with the maps is also quantified, for instance by prediction error variance maps or by maps of the lower and upper limits of a prediction interval. In addition, these products are often aggregated to regional, national, or global scales relevant to climate policy, natural resource inventory, and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) frameworks. Quantifying uncertainty in aggregated products is crucial as it is necessary to assess their value and evaluate whether changes and trends in aggregated estimates are statistically significant. However, we argue that such uncertainty is frequently inaccurately assessed due to the neglect of spatial correlation in map errors. This critical methodological issue has been overlooked in most large-scale mapping studies."

 Forest disturbance regimes are changing across the globe under the influence of climate change and other global change factors, with potentially substantial consequences for tree mortality rates. Tree mortality has been assessed using field and aerial surveys and, more recently, frequently using satellite remote sensing-based techniques. Rapid detection of tree mortality is often important in decision-making around wood salvage and other potential responses. Our study tested techniques to rapidly distinguish tree mortality in temperate broadleaf deciduous forests following drought and spongy moth defoliation in Connecticut, USA using single-date imagery. We applied random forest classification to identify mortality occurrence and severity using single-date Landsat-8 imagery and compared outcomes to annual USDA Insect and Disease Detection Surveys (IDS). Training data were produced by manually delineating mortality visible in high-resolution (1 m) 2018 US National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery and validated against field plot data. Overall accuracy in mortality detection using single-date imagery ranged from 59.3 %–85.0 % with better results for mortality occurrence detection than severity classification. Image classification analysis identified on average 15,340 ha of mortality across the study area, while IDS identified 10,168 ha.

 Interactive segmentation of remote sensing images enables the rapid generation of annotated samples, providing training samples for deep learning algorithms and facilitating high-quality extraction and classification for remote sensing objects. However, existing interactive segmentation methods, such as SAM, are primarily designed for natural images and show inefficiencies when applied to remote sensing images. These methods often require multiple interactions to achieve satisfactory labeling results and frequently struggle to obtain precise target boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality one-shot interactive segmentation method (OSISeg) based on the fine-tuning of foundation models, tailored for the efficient annotation of typical objects in remote sensing imagery. OSISeg utilizes robust visual priors from foundation models and implements a hybrid adapter-based strategy for fine-tuning these models. Specifically, It employs a parallel structure with hybrid adapter designs to adjust multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks within foundation models, effectively aligning remote sensing image features for interactive segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the proposed OSISeg integrates point, box, and scribble prompts, facilitating high-quality segmentation only using one prompt through a lightweight decoder. Experimental results on multiple datasets—including buildings, water bodies, and woodlands—demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning methods and significantly enhances the quality of one-shot interactive segmentation for typical remote sensing objects.

 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a powerful technique for addressing the distribution shift across various Remote Sensing (RS) applications. However, most UDA approaches require access to source data, which may be infeasible due to data privacy or transmission constraints. Source-free Domain Adaptation addresses the absence of source data but usually demands a large amount of target domain data beforehand, hindering rapid adaptation and restricting their applicability in broader scenarios. In practical cross-domain RS image classification, achieving a balance between adaptation speed and accuracy is crucial. Therefore, we propose Low Saturation Confidence Distribution Test-Time Adaptation (LSCD-TTA), marketing the first attempt to explore Test-Time Adaptation for cross-domain RS image classification without requiring source or target training data. LSCD-TTA adapts a source-trained model on the fly using only the target test data encountered during inference, enabling immediate and efficient adaptation while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, LSCD-TTA incorporates three optimization strategies tailored to the distribution characteristics of RS images. Firstly, weak-confidence softmax-entropy loss emphasizes categories that are more difficult to classify to address unbalanced class distribution. Secondly, balanced-categories softmax-entropy loss softens and balances the predicted probabilities to tackle the category diversity. Finally, low saturation distribution loss utilizes soft log-likelihood ratios to reduce the impact of low-confidence samples in the later stages of adaptation. By effectively combining these losses, LSCD-TTA enables rapid and accurate adaptation to the target domain for RS image classification. We evaluate LSCD-TTA on six domain adaptation tasks across three RS datasets, where LSCD-TTA outperforms existing DA and TTA methods with average accuracy gains of 4.99% on Resnet-50, 5.22% on Resnet-101, and 2.37% on ViT-B/16."

 Recent advances in deep learning have enhanced crop classification, yet current research still underutilizes the hierarchical information of crop types, limiting classification accuracy. As categories are subdivided, the sample imbalance intensifies, posing a challenge to fine classification of crops. To address this, we propose the Class Semantic Guided Hierarchical Segmentation Framework (SemHi framework) for satellite image time series (SITS) crop classification. This framework effectively leverages the hierarchical information in the class system and outputs classification results at each level in an end-to-end manner. The SemHi framework comprises four modules: (1) The backbone that learns the spatio-temporal features; (2) The label embedding module, a core component that guides the feature learning through the fusion of hierarchical structure and textual representations; (3) The prototype distance measurement module to enhance class separation and reduce within-class variation; (4) The hierarchical logic regularization module, which enables multi-granularity crop predictions and strengthens the hierarchical logic between them. The validation results on the public crop classification dataset show that the SemHi framework with multi-dimensional fusion of spatio-temporal-text information significantly improves the performance of all state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks on fine-grained classes, with an overall accuracy improvement of 0.48% to 13.86%. Furthermore, experiments on a remote sensing classification dataset demonstrate the framework’s generality and potential for broader applications in remote sensing tasks."

 The artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecast foundation models can infer and generate precise global atmospheric state forecasts on the user’s device and with speed over 10,000 times faster than the operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and it is making increasingly significant contributions to geodetic applications represented by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, existing studies on the investigation of these AI models are typically carried out by concentrating on specific one or several meteorological events in certain regions or by comparison with physical models, and the evaluation results obtained in this manner are not comprehensive and universal. Additionally, we find that the results obtained by the foundation models through the “rollout” method for forecasting are not uniform in terms of time and space. This temporal and spatial inhomogeneity of accuracy and accuracy degradation are related to AI algorithms and attributes of training data, etc., but these characteristics have not been thoroughly explored and analyzed. In this study, we obtained the global forecast results of foundation models for 2022 and subsequently derived the GNSS tropospheric delay through numerical integration. We calculated the mean deviation, mean absolute error, and root mean square error of these data. Using these metrics, we analyzed the spatiotemporal inhomogeneity in the accuracy degradation of foundation models, represented by Huawei Cloud Pangu-Weather, Google DeepMind GraphCast, and Shanghai AI Lab FengWu. We evaluated how this inhomogeneity changes with forecast time and identified the best-performing models across different regions and forecast durations. From the results, we find that taking topography into account when training the model enhances its accuracy at high altitudes, and the facilitating influence between the high related atmospheric variables such as precipitation and water vapor. The contributions of this study are twofold: it serves as a valuable reference for geodetic and remote sensing users employing foundational models, and offers insights and case supports for AI practitioners aiming to develop more accurate models for weather forecasting."

 Wildfires significantly reshape the landscape of the Mediterranean basin, altering forest composition, structure, and diversity. Consequently, detailed fuel mapping is crucial for improving fire risk assessment and enhancing fire behavior modeling, as wildfires typically ignite from surface fuels and may spread vertically to canopy fuels due to canopy fuel continuity. This study generates a fuel type map of the overstory and understory based on the FirEUrisk hierarchical fuel classification system (FHFCS) in three steps, including overstory mapping using multispectral and radar data (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), and topographic variables; shrubland and grassland height estimation using biophysical models based on precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); and understory mapping using spaceborne LiDAR data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) and decision rules. An Overall Accuracy (OA) of 84.53% was achieved for overstory mapping for the composition of Vegetation Indices (VIs), Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures, vertical transmit–horizontal receive (VH) of Sentinel-1, and elevation, integrated with biophysical models. Cropland, urban, non-fuel, and various forest classes, particularly evergreen needle-leaved forests, demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving F1 scores ranging from 83% to 100%.

 High-accuracy digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for remote sensing and geospatial analysis, yet integrating multi-source data over large and complex terrains remains challenging. To address these challenges, this study presents the Multi-source Data Joint Processing (MDJP) framework. This framework establishes a systematic way for correcting DEM errors of varying quality and integrating multi-source data, leveraging deep learning-based calibration and spatially adaptive fusion techniques to enhance DEM accuracy and consistency in large and complex regions. For calibration, our proposed DEM calibration model (DemFormer) combines a lightweight Transformer module with a bagging decision-tree network in a stacking framework, specifically designed to enhance the stability and accuracy of DEM elevation error predictions. For fusion, our DEM fusion model (DemFusion) employs spatial autocorrelation analysis and KD-Tree clustering to compute optimal fusion weights, effectively integrating complementary elevation information from multiple DEM sources. We evaluate the MDJP framework using four widely used global DEMs—Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X), Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D-30 m (AW3D30)—each at 1-arc second (∼30 m) resolution.

 The imaging features of oil spills in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have significant differences due to factors such as marine environment, SAR sensors, oil film thickness and types, which makes it difficult to obtain a generalized model, and the limited number of SAR images obtained from new oil spill events hampers the effective training of deep learning networks. To solve these issues, an enhanced unsupervised domain adaptation with iterative pseudo-label refinement (EUDA-PLR) approach is proposed for inter-event oil spill SAR image segmentation. Specifically, the freely downloaded and collected Sentinel-1 and ERS-1/2 oil spill historical data are used as source domains, respectively, which are migrated to each new oil spill event with limited training samples based on adversarial training to improve the timeliness and accuracy of processing new oil spill events. Subsequently, the target domain is divided more rationally by combining the knowledge of the resolution and polarization mode of the satellite images, the wind speed information of the marine environment, and the computable oil-seawater power ratio. Finally, high-probability oil spill features are stored and updated based on top-K marginal probabilities to improve the completeness of oil spill features in the pseudo-labeling of strong samples in the target domain, and adversarial training is utilized to enhance the ability to extract oil spill features from weak samples in the target domain. EUDA-PLR is applicable to a variety of current mainstream SAR satellites.

 The automated extraction of building facade footprints (BFFs) is a critical task in surveying and remote sensing. Existing methods primarily use mobile laser scanning point cloud as the data source, with limited methods utilizing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. This is mainly because current methods require explicit building extraction and wall detection, and the facade points in ALS point clouds are naturally sparse and prone to incompleteness, leading to insufficient robustness in rule-based wall extraction. To address this challenge, this paper presents an end-to-end method named deep projective prediction (DPP), which directly predicts BFF masks from ALS point clouds, avoiding explicit extraction of buildings and facades, thereby simplifying the BFF extraction process. Meanwhile, we introduce a back-projective attention (BPAtt) module that guides the decoding process while performing differentiable projections, enhancing the model’s sensitivity to projected feature locations. Additionally, a sparse feature completion (SFC) strategy is proposed to alleviate the impact of point cloud sparsity on footprint mask prediction. To validate the effectiveness of the DPP and facilitate relevant future research, an ALS-based BFF dataset is established, which provides more than 3k BFF annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DPP achieves promising results on the BFF extraction task.

 Under anthropogenic disturbances and global warming, coral reef ecosystems are degrading, and there is growing concern about the changes in benthic habitats in shallow coral reef waters. As an essential parameter, bottom reflectance can be used to indicate the health of benthic habitats in coral reefs. However, accurately determining bottom reflectance from satellite data remains challenging. This study presents an equation-based analytical method to estimate the bottom reflectance from high-spatial-resolution multispectral images in shallow coral reef waters by establishing two equations independent of bottom type and water depth. With the required parameters estimated from the sampling pixels of the multi-spectral image, the bottom reflectance data for the blue and green bands were derived by solving the two equations without a prior knowledge of bottom types, water properties, and water depths. To evaluate the method, simulated remote-sensing reflectance datasets from various combinations of the water properties, depths, and bottom types were used to derive the bottom reflectance. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the derived bottom reflectance in the blue band were generally <0.02 for most cases, except when the colored dissolved organic matter spectral absorption coefficient at the 440 nm wavelength [aCDOM (440)] was 0.1 m−1 and concentration of chlorophyll (CCHL) was ≥0.5 μg/L. Comparatively, the lower RMSEs in the green band were observed only when aCDOM(440) < 0.05 m−1, concentration of non-algal particles (CNAP) < 0.25 mg/L, and CCHL < 0.5 μg/L. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied to the two real satellite multispectral images to derive the bottom reflectance. By visually comparing to the subsurface reflectance images and validating with the field-measured reflectance data, we demonstrated that the satellite derived bottom reflectance in the blue and green bands was accurate in both magnitude and shape by the proposed method. Finally, the impacts of the spatial inhomogeneity of the water properties, purity of sampling pixels for estimating the band ratio of the total diffused attenuation coefficients, and errors in the radiometric correction on the bottom reflectance retrieval were discussed and analyzed."

 Considering the importance of greenspace for the health and life of urban citizens, different levels of greenspace exposure (GE) have received increasing attention. However, the understanding of human travel-related greenspace exposure is still limited, especially the lack of quantitative description of the fine-grained dynamics of greenspace exposure for active travel. Therefore, this study aims to quantify and analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics and equality of greenspace exposure during daily travel using dockless bike-sharing data in Beijing. Firstly, this study analysed the spatio-temporal patterns and community structure of bike-sharing travel using graph networks. Second, the daily travel-related greenspace exposure dynamics were estimated using a population-weighted exposure model. Finally, the spatial heterogeneity and equality of greenspace exposure during daily travel were assessed. The results show that greenspace exposure is shaped by both human mobility and greenspace distribution. Greenspace exposure is higher during the daytime than the early morning, and there are no significant changes of the average greenspace exposure across weekdays and weekends. In addition, there is an imbalance between greenspace coverage and exposure, with high greenspace coverage not implying high greenspace exposure and vice versa. Areas with lower greenspace coverage (less than 30 %) occurred for more than 80 % of the travels.

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for climate studies and land surface process models as it indicates ground surface temperature variations across landscapes and timescales. However, satellite-based LST products derived from infrared sensors suffer from substantial missing values due to extensive cloud covers on the Earth’s surface. Traditional methods rely heavily on numerical LST simulations for gap-filling, but the latency significantly limits the timeliness of gapless LST products. In this study, a novel deep learning method called the Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) was proposed, which was based on a U-Net architecture but enhanced with two unique feature extraction modules for capturing spatially and temporally dependent LST variations. Unlike many previous methods depending highly on numerical simulations, STAN reconstructs LST relying on spatiotemporal context information learned from historical memories, enabling more efficient LST reconstruction in a more timely manner. Ground validation results demonstrate better performance of STAN over other companion methods, with root-mean-square errors of 1.99 K and 2.89 K under clear and cloudy sky respectively, when reconstructing LST data collected from the Chinese Fengyun-4A geostationary satellite in the Yangtze River Delta. Intercomparison studies and error analysis also confirm the superiority of STAN, showing high LST reconstruction accuracy across different land covers and seasons. Overall, the proposed STAN method offers a much more efficient solution to facilitate timely LST reconstruction, and the method can also be easily transferred to other parameters with significant spatio-temporal variation context."

 Scholars have documented that perceived safety of the visual built environment (VBE) can influence human behaviors. The dual developments of street view imagery (SVI) and deep learning techniques offer a cost-effective approach to measure perceived safety. However, current SVI-based perception models often lack specific definitions of perceived safety and demographic information when collecting data for model training. Furthermore, these models are rarely validated by onsite perception evaluations, which undermines their credibility.Given these gaps, this study builds a localized crowdsourcing survey to train crime-related and barrier-related perceived safety of the VBE captured by SVIs, and compares model-predicted perceptions with onsite perceptions. This study specifically focuses on their ability to represent onsite perceptions and examines gender differences as a test case in safety perception. This study recruits over 1,800 participants living in the Greater Toronto Area to rate SVIs in terms of crime-related and barrier-related perceived safety.Pearson correlation coefficients reveal a positive but weak correlation between female and male safety perceptions, indicating some consistency while highlighting potential gender differences in safety perceptions. Machine-learning perception models are then trained using this localized SVI survey. Model-predicted perceptions are further validated to assess their alignments with onsite perceptions at sampling locations. The results show that model-predicted perceptions do not exactly match onsite perceptions but align better when less stringent criteria are applied (within ± 1 scale point).In short, this study underscores the necessity of gender inclusivity and a clear definition of safety terms when using SVIs to model perceptions. While SVI-based perception models are cost-effective, the predicted perceptions cannot yet fully substitute onsite perceptions, necessitating broader research to refine the effectiveness."

 Rapid urbanization and global climate change are intensifying the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in cities worldwide, with consequences for human health and well-being. Urban green spaces (UGSs) mitigate extreme temperatures, but their cooling potential depends on spatial configuration, size, shape, and distribution. This study fills a geographic gap by providing one of the first detailed analyses of UGSs-Land Surface Temperature (LST) dynamics in a North African context. It combines spatial pattern analysis with temporal trend detection to comprehensively evaluate UGSs-LST relationships in Algiers from 2004 to 2022, addressing a common limitation in the literature where these approaches are often treated separately. Using freely available satellite data and open-source tools—including Landsat data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), QGIS, and RStudio—we integrate supervised classification, landscape metrics (LMs) computation via our custom PyQGIS LMs calculator, and Mann-Kendall trend analysis to quantify the static spatial configuration of green spaces and their dynamic thermal impacts over time. Findings reveal a 38% decrease in green spaces and a 10% reduction in agricultural land, accompanied by increased urbanization. Strong negative correlations between some LMs and LST were observed, with PLAND (Percentage of Landscape) explaining 61% of LST variability at an optimal 600-meter scale. This medium-sized scale differs from previous findings in other regions, highlighting the importance of context-specific analysis. LST trend analysis identified specific heat-resistant zones characterized by large, contiguous green patches. Despite greening initiatives, UGSs in Algiers continue to decline, underlining the need to preserve and strategically expand UGSs to combat rising temperatures."

 China, despite being a leading producer of potatoes, has a potato yield below the global average, primarily due to inefficient nutrient management practices. Remote sensing provides a non-invasive and large-scale approach to monitor crop nutrient status, offering an efficient alternative to traditional plant tissue analysis. However, the generalization of foliar nutrient models is often constrained by factors such as growth stages and planting cultivars. Transfer learning offers a powerful solution by utilizing knowledge acquired from one task to enhance performance in related one, addressing challenges in model generalizability. Here, we investigated the potential of integrating various transfer learning techniques with partial least squares regression (PLSR) for retrieving three key potato foliar nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) across five growth stages (emergence, tuber initiation, early tuber bulking, mid-tuber bulking and tuber maturation). Three categories of transfer learning techniques were examined: 1) instance-based, including PLSR-KMM (kernel mean matching) and PLSR-TrAdaBoostR2 (transfer adaptive boosting for regression); 2) feature-based, including PLSR-TCA (transfer component analysis); and 3) parameter-based, including PLSR-parameter-based. We found that: 1) The combination of transfer learning techniques with PLSR could generally enhance the model transferability across growth stages, with a decrease in the normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE of 1–10 % for nitrogen, 3–60 % for phosphorous, and 1–15 % potassium; 2) The ranking of transfer learning techniques for improving model generalizability was: PLSR-TrAdaBootR2 > PLSR-parameter based > PLSR-recalibrated > PLSR-TCA > PLSR-KMM; 3) Foliar nitrogen demonstrated the highest transferability, followed by potassium and phosphorus; 4) PLSR models integrated with transfer learning techniques more effectively leveraged the absorption features of foliar biochemistry (e.g., chlorophyll, water and dry matters) to predict nutrients."

 Quantitative remote sensing-based forest parameter estimation is challenging in tropical mountainous conditions with complex topography and vegetation. To address this issue, we conducted a study utilizing Landsat 8, ALOS-2 PALSAR, and GEDI data. We applied an effective deep learning framework—Deep Markov Regression (DMR)—along with Random Forest Regression (RF) and 3D Regression Kriging (3DRK) methods to estimate canopy height in subtropical mountain forests.

Additionally, we treated “slope” as a dummy variable and incorporated factors such as slope and geographic coordinates into the model. The results showed that optical remote sensing provided the highest estimation accuracy in mountainous terrain, significantly outperforming both GEDI and SAR data. The combination of multiple remote sensing datasets further enhanced the estimation accuracy. Incorporating slope and geographic location data also improved model performance.

 The increasing demand for spatiotemporal data and modeling tasks in geosciences has made geospatial code generation technology a critical factor in enhancing productivity. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in code generation tasks, they often encounter issues such as refusal to code or hallucination in geospatial code generation due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge and code corpora.

Additionally, by leveraging QLoRA and LoRA for pretraining and fine-tuning, we introduce GeoCode-GPT-7B, the first LLM focused on geospatial code generation, fine-tuned from Code Llama-7B. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive geospatial code evaluation framework, incorporating option matching, expert validation, and prompt engineering scoring for LLMs, and systematically evaluate GeoCode-GPT-7B using the GeoCode-Eval dataset. Experimental results reveal that GeoCode-GPT significantly outperforms existing models across multiple tasks. For multiple-choice tasks, its accuracy improves by 9.1% to 32.1%.

 Soil texture is an essential attribute of soil structure, which plays an important role in evaluating soil fertility and carrying out agricultural production. This study developed a novel soil texture estimation model using ZiYuan-1-02D (ZY1-02D) satellite Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI), based on the mechanism of soil spectral mixing, that enables simultaneous estimation of the three soil texture attributes (clay, silt, and sand). Study area is located in the north-eastern region of China covering 1683.31 km2. To reduce data redundancy, we used correlation analysis and Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) algorithms to select sensitive spectral features of soil texture, and excluded spectral bands that are strongly influenced by other soil physicochemical properties. Finally, the spatial distribution map and classification map of soil texture have been generated for the study area. We also used AHSI/GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite images to further validate the generalizability of the model. The results suggest that the model can be used in the estimation of soil texture, and the developed novel model can effectively reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of surface soil texture attributes.

 The integration of Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data with Optical Photogrammetric Satellite Stereo Imagery (OPSSI) for Block Adjustment (BA) has emerged as a novel approach for generating large-area, high-accuracy Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, owing to the discrepancies between these two data platforms and the systematic errors of their sensors, errors arise in the BA fusion outcomes during the matching process of the two datasets. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing the accuracy of the BA process. Initially, the multi-characteristic constraint is used to filter the ICESat-2 ATL08 product to obtain control points and check points. Subsequently, the Terrain Matching Correction is applied to control points, and then integrated with the GF-7 OPSSI for BA to generate DEM. Ultimately, the check points are employed to assess the accuracy of the established DEM. Experiments in a 2,000 km2 test area in the Wuding River Basin show that: (1) The inclusion of ICESat-2 data has remarkably enhanced the accuracy of DEM modeling utilizing GF-7 OPSSI, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been reduced from the range of 5–10 m to 2–6 m. (2) Multi-characteristic constraint filtering is crucial for the identification of high quality ICESat-2 control points in flat and low relief areas. When implementing this filtering method, the established criteria should comprehensively consider both the quantity and the spatial distribution of control points to ensure optimal results. (3) Terrain Matching Correction on ICESat-2 data has effectively elevated the vertical accuracy of DEM modeling, particularly in regions with flat terrain. The RMSE of the vertical accuracy in such areas can be decreased by 1–3 m. In summary, the integration of spaceborne laser altimeter data with OPSSI holds immense significance for the production of large-scale and high-accuracy DEMs, offering a promising solution for terrain modeling and analysis on regional scales."

 High-resolution (≤10 m) digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for obtaining accurate terrain information and are integral to geographic analysis. However, a majority of currently available DEMs datasets possess a relatively coarse spatial resolution (≥30 m), which limits the terrain features and details that can be accurately represented. Furthermore, due to the substantial production costs associated with high-resolution DEMs, these products are often unavailable or difficult to obtain in numerous countries and regions, particularly in less developed areas. Here, we introduced a novel method named the Spatial interpolation knowledge-constrained Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (SikCGAN). This method can generate high-resolution DEMs from publicly available data sources, specifically the photons collected by the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) carried by the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). SikCGAN takes ICESat-2/ATLAS photons as the single data source and incorporates spatial interpolation knowledge constraints into a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate DEMs at a 10-m spatial resolution. A case study conducted in boreal mountainous regions demonstrates SikCGAN’s remarkable ability to produce high-resolution and highly accurate DEMs, with an MAE of 22.09 m and RMSE of 29.25 m, which reduced error by 37 %–46 % compared to benchmark methods. Additionally, the results reveal that SikCGAN has remarkable resiliece to interference, including variations in spatial distance, terrain slope, and ATL03 photon count, this further elucidates and substantiates the effectiveness of SikCGAN. These findings demonstrate that SikCGAN provides innovative solutions for generating new high-resolution DEMs products and potentially supplementing existing ones to overcome their limitations."

 Tidal flats and their associated sandbanks are dynamic environments crucial for ecological balance and biodiversity. Monitoring their evolutionary history and topographic changes is important to better understand their dynamic mechanisms and predict their future status. Accurately mapping their evolution, however, remains challenging due to highly dynamic currents, suspended sediment variability, and unclear boundaries between land, tidal flats, and water. Traditional waterline methods struggle under these conditions. In this study, we propose an Object-Based Image Segmentation (OBIS) method, specifically designed for SAR images, to extract waterlines and distinguish tidal flats and shorelines from water bodies. This method integrates SAR polarimetric feature analysis to select high-quality images and employs partition processing to preserve local feature statistics. Using 199 Sentinel-1 GRD, 132 Radarsat-2 SLC, and 157 Landsat images, we analyzed coastal dynamics in the Dutch Wadden Sea from 1986 to 2020. Our DEMs, validated against LiDAR data (2016–2019) and 58 ground anchor measuring stations (2011–2020), achieved an accuracy of 10–30 cm. Results show that coastal tidal flats and sandbanks expanded at rates of 0.107–0.324 km2 yr−1 and 0.010–0.073 km2 yr−1, respectively, with a net intertidal volume increase of approximately 8.6×107m3. The generated DEMs provide valuable insights for sediment budget evaluation and hydrodynamic modeling, supporting scientific research and coastal management. The proposed OBIS-based framework demonstrates its effectiveness for mapping national-scale tidal flats and sandbanks dynamics."

 Accurate measurement of high-resolution snow depth (SD) is crucial for regional ecohydrology and climate studies. Passive microwave remote sensing is an effective technique for SD retrieval on global or regional scales. However, its low spatial resolution limits its application in various fields. Additionally, the complex effects of multiple factors in the microwave radiation process pose a significant challenge for accurate SD retrieval as SD increases. In this study, a high-resolution SD retrieval algorithm for passive microwave data was developed based on the linear unmixing method and machine learning (ML) stacking technique. Firstly, the 0.25° AMSR2 brightness temperature data were downscaled to 0.01° through linear unmixing. Then, combining the temporal and spatial features of the snowpack, the high-resolution SD was retrieved based on the ML stacking technique. This method combined the advantages of multiple base models for retrieving different depths of snow, which effectively improved the overall estimation performance of the algorithm. Compared with in situ observed SD at meteorological stations and field observation SD, the algorithm achieved an overall RMSE of 5.25 cm, which was lower than that of other coarse-resolution SD datasets and products, including the long-term series of daily SD dataset in China (7.40 cm), the ERA5-Land (9.71 cm), and JAXA AMSR2 Level 2 SD products (12.59 cm). Especially, it reduced the estimation error of deep snow with a depth exceeding 30 cm by 20.3 %, 21.5 %, and 24.9 %, respectively."

 An in-depth comparative analysis of hailfall and nonhailfall clouds during a severe storm in Laixi city, Shandong Province, China, is conducted in this study. By integrating radar observations and mesoscale numerical simulations, key distinguishing features between the two cloud types are identified. The results indicate that the strong-echo top height and cloud top height of hailfall clouds are lower than those of nonhailfall clouds, which contradicts the traditional concept that the cloud top height and the strong-echo top height are proportional to the hailfall potential. This study emphasizes the importance of the vertical structure of clouds and environmental conditions in identifying hail storms. Low differential reflectivity (ZDR) (≤0) and low correlation coefficient (ρHV) (<0.9) values are observed near the strong-echo core of hailfall clouds, whereas the strong-echo core of nonhailfall clouds is characterized by high ZDR (>3 dB) and high ρHV (>0.95) values. There is also a clear difference between the evolution characteristics of ZDR and ZH at the early development stage: ZDR initially increases and then decreases, with a decrease in ZDR accompanied by an increase in ZH, indicating the transformation of liquid water into hail. In contrast, ZDR of nonhailfall clouds continues to increase after ZH increases from high altitudes to the surface, suggesting the dominance of large raindrops. Further analysis reveals that supercooled water in hailfall clouds is concentrated at the forefront of the hail zone, which is critical for hail formation, whereas nonhailfall clouds lack this feature. This study provides new insights into the early identification and warning of hailfall clouds, contributes to an increased accuracy in hail disaster warnings and provides a solid foundation for artificial hail suppression."
