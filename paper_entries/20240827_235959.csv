10.1038/s41586-024-07809-y,Birth of protein folds and functions in the virome,"Structural comparison of predicted viral protein structures with known protein structures suggests taxonomic relationships and functions for up to 25% of unannotated viral proteins, including many with putative functions in host immune evasion. 
 The rapid evolution of viruses generates proteins that are essential for infectivity and replication but with unknown functions, due to extreme sequence divergence1. Here, using a database of 67,715 newly predicted protein structures from 4,463 eukaryotic viral species, we found that 62% of viral proteins are structurally distinct and lack homologues in the AlphaFold database2,3. Among the remaining 38% of viral proteins, many have non-viral structural analogues that revealed surprising similarities between human pathogens and their eukaryotic hosts. Structural comparisons suggested putative functions for up to 25% of unannotated viral proteins, including those with roles in the evasion of innate immunity. In particular, RNA ligase T-like phosphodiesterases were found to resemble phage-encoded proteins that hydrolyse the host immune-activating cyclic dinucleotides 3′,3′- and 2′,3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Experimental analysis showed that RNA ligase T homologues encoded by avian poxviruses similarly hydrolyse cGAMP, showing that RNA ligase T-mediated targeting of cGAMP is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of immune evasion that is present in both bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses. Together, the viral protein structural database and analyses presented here afford new opportunities to identify mechanisms of virus–host interactions that are common across the virome.

 Although aromatic rings are common elements in pharmaceutically active compounds, the presence of these motifs brings several liabilities with respect to the developability of a drug1. Nonoptimal potency, metabolic stability, solubility and lipophilicity in pharmaceutical compounds can be improved by replacing aromatic rings with non-aromatic isosteric motifs2. Moreover, whereas aromatic rings are planar and lack three-dimensionality, the binding pockets of most pharmaceutical targets are chiral. Thus, the stereochemical configuration of the isosteric replacements may offer an added opportunity to improve the affinity of derived ligands for target receptors. A notable impediment to this approach is the lack of simple and scalable catalytic enantioselective syntheses of candidate isosteres from readily available precursors. Here we present a previously unknown palladium-catalysed reaction that converts hydrocarbon-derived precursors to chiral boron-containing nortricyclanes and we show that the shape of these nortricyclanes makes them plausible isosteres for meta disubstituted aromatic rings. With chiral catalysts, the Pd-catalysed reaction can be accomplished in an enantioselective fashion and subsequent transformation of the boron group provides access to a broad array of structures. We also show that the incorporation of nortricyclanes into pharmaceutical motifs can result in improved biophysical properties along with stereochemistry-dependent activity. We anticipate that these features, coupled with the simple, inexpensive synthesis of the functionalized nortricyclane scaffold, will render this platform a useful foundation for the assembly of new biologically active agents.

 Superconductivity involving finite-momentum pairing1 can lead to spatial-gap and pair-density modulations, as well as Bogoliubov Fermi states within the superconducting gap. However, the experimental realization of their intertwined relations has been challenging. Here we detect chiral kagome superconductivity modulations with residual Fermi arcs in KV3Sb5 and CsV3Sb5 using normal and Josephson scanning tunnelling microscopy down to 30 millikelvin with a resolved electronic energy difference at the microelectronvolt level. We observe a U-shaped superconducting gap with flat residual in-gap states. This gap shows chiral 2a × 2a spatial modulations with magnetic-field-tunable chirality, which align with the chiral 2a × 2a pair-density modulations observed through Josephson tunnelling. These findings demonstrate a chiral pair density wave (PDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Quasiparticle interference imaging of the in-gap zero-energy states reveals segmented arcs, with high-temperature data linking them to parts of the reconstructed vanadium d-orbital states within the charge order. The detected residual Fermi arcs can be explained by the partial suppression of these d-orbital states through an interorbital 2a × 2a PDW and thus serve as candidate Bogoliubov Fermi states. In addition, we differentiate the observed PDW order from impurity-induced gap modulations. Our observations not only uncover a chiral PDW order with orbital selectivity but also show the fundamental space–momentum correspondence inherent in finite-momentum-paired superconductivity.

10.1038/s41586-024-07833-y,Effective realization of abatement measures can reduce HFC-23 emissions,"Fulfilment of current abatement technology at the factory level could reduce HFC-23 emissions by approximately 84%. 
 HFC-23 is a potent greenhouse gas, predominantly emitted as an undesired by-product during the synthesis and processing of HCFC-22 (ref. 1). Previously, the Clean Development Mechanism and national efforts called for the implementation of abatement technology for reducing HFC-23 emissions2,3. Nevertheless, between 2015 and 2019, a divergence was found between the global emissions derived from atmospheric observations and those expected from reported abatement1,2. Primarily, this points to insufficient implementation of abatement strategies2,4, calling for independent verification of the emissions at the individual chemical facility level. Here we use regional atmospheric observations and a new, deliberately released tracer to quantify the HFC-23 emissions from an HCFC-22 and fluoropolymer production facility, which is equipped with waste gas destruction technology. We find that our inferred HFC-23/HCFC-22 emission factor of 0.19% (0.13–0.24%) broadly fits within the emission factor considered practicable for abatement projects5,6. Extrapolation to global HCFC-22 production underscores that the operation of appropriate destruction technology has the potential to reduce global HFC-23 emissions by at least 84% (69–100%) (14 (12–16) Gg yr−1). This reduction is equivalent to 17% CO2 emissions from aviation in 2019 (ref. 7). We also demonstrate co-destruction of PFC-318, another by-product and greenhouse gas. Our findings show the importance of the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which obligates parties to destroy HFC-23 emissions from facilities manufacturing hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons “to the extent practicable” from 2020 onwards8. Fulfilment of current abatement technology at the factory level could reduce HFC-23 emissions by approximately 84%.",Dominique Rust;Martin K.

10.1038/s41586-024-07840-z,Short-term post-fast refeeding enhances intestinal stemness via polyamines,"Post-fast refeeding increases intestinal stem cell function and tumour formation by augmenting protein synthesis via polyamine metabolism. 
 For over a century, fasting regimens have improved health, lifespan and tissue regeneration in diverse organisms, including humans1–6. However, how fasting and post-fast refeeding affect adult stem cells and tumour formation has yet to be explored in depth. Here we demonstrate that post-fast refeeding increases intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and tumour formation; post-fast refeeding augments the regenerative capacity of Lgr5+ ISCs, and loss of the tumour suppressor gene Apc in post-fast-refed ISCs leads to a higher tumour incidence in the small intestine and colon than in the fasted or ad libitum-fed states, demonstrating that post-fast refeeding is a distinct state. Mechanistically, we discovered that robust mTORC1 induction in post-fast-refed ISCs increases protein synthesis via polyamine metabolism to drive these changes, as inhibition of mTORC1, polyamine metabolite production or protein synthesis abrogates the regenerative or tumorigenic effects of post-fast refeeding. Given our findings, fast–refeeding cycles must be carefully considered and tested when planning diet-based strategies for regeneration without increasing cancer risk, as post-fast refeeding leads to a burst in stem-cell-driven regeneration and tumorigenicity.

10.1038/s41586-024-07831-0,Highly variable magmatic accretion at the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel Ridge,"Results from a high-resolution ocean-bottom seismometer experiment at the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel Ridge show unexpected highly variable crustal thickness and a relatively large average value, which can be explained by an active mantle upwelling model. 
 Crustal accretion at mid-ocean ridges governs the creation and evolution of the oceanic lithosphere. Generally accepted models1–4 of passive mantle upwelling and melting predict notably decreased crustal thickness at a spreading rate of less than 20 mm year−1. We conducted the first, to our knowledge, high-resolution ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) experiment at the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean and imaged the crustal structure of the slowest-spreading ridge on the Earth. Unexpectedly, we find that crustal thickness ranges between 3.3 km and 8.9 km along the ridge axis and it increased from about 4.5 km to about 7.5 km over the past 5 Myr in an across-axis profile. The highly variable crustal thickness and relatively large average value does not align with the prediction of passive mantle upwelling models. Instead, it can be explained by a model of buoyant active mantle flow driven by thermal and compositional density changes owing to melt extraction. The influence of active versus passive upwelling is predicted to increase with decreasing spreading rate. The process of active mantle upwelling is anticipated to be primarily influenced by mantle temperature and composition. This implies that the observed variability in crustal accretion, which includes notably varied crustal thickness, is probably an inherent characteristic of ultraslow-spreading ridges.

 Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a pivotal role in allergic responses1,2. The high-affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI, found on mast cells and basophils, is central to the effector functions of IgE. FcεRI is a tetrameric complex, comprising FcεRIα, FcεRIβ and a homodimer of FcRγ (originally known as FcεRIγ), with FcεRIα recognizing the Fc region of IgE (Fcε) and FcεRIβ–FcRγ facilitating signal transduction3. Additionally, FcRγ is a crucial component of other immunoglobulin receptors, including those for IgG (FcγRI and FcγRIIIA) and IgA (FcαRI)4–8. However, the molecular basis of FcεRI assembly and the structure of FcRγ have remained elusive. Here we elucidate the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the Fcε–FcεRI complex. FcεRIα has an essential role in the receptor’s assembly, interacting with FcεRIβ and both FcRγ subunits. FcεRIβ is structured as a compact four-helix bundle, similar to the B cell antigen CD20. The FcRγ dimer exhibits an asymmetric architecture, and coils with the transmembrane region of FcεRIα to form a three-helix bundle. A cholesterol-like molecule enhances the interaction between FcεRIβ and the FcεRIα–FcRγ complex. Our mutagenesis analyses further indicate similarities between the interaction of FcRγ with FcεRIα and FcγRIIIA, but differences in that with FcαRI. These findings deepen our understanding of the signalling mechanisms of FcεRI and offer insights into the functionality of other immune receptors dependent on FcRγ.

 Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is a fundamental macronutrient for all living organisms, the homeostasis of which is critical for numerous biological activities1–3. As the only known human Pi exporter to date, XPR1 has an indispensable role in cellular Pi homeostasis4,5. Dysfunction of XPR1 is associated with neurodegenerative disease6–8. However, the mechanisms underpinning XPR1-mediated Pi efflux and regulation by the intracellular inositol polyphosphate (InsPP) sensor SPX domain remain poorly understood. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human XPR1 in Pi-bound closed, open and InsP6-bound forms, revealing the structural basis for XPR1 gating and regulation by InsPPs. XPR1 consists of an N-terminal SPX domain, a dimer-formation core domain and a Pi transport domain. Within the transport domain, three basic clusters are responsible for Pi binding and transport, and a conserved W573 acts as a molecular switch for gating. In addition, the SPX domain binds to InsP6 and facilitates Pi efflux by liberating the C-terminal loop that limits Pi entry. This study provides a conceptual framework for the mechanistic understanding of Pi homeostasis by XPR1 homologues in fungi, plants and animals.

 Chaperonins are large barrel-shaped complexes that mediate ATP-dependent protein folding1–3. The bacterial chaperonin GroEL forms juxtaposed rings that bind unfolded protein and the lid-shaped cofactor GroES at their apertures. In vitro analyses of the chaperonin reaction have shown that substrate protein folds, unimpaired by aggregation, while transiently encapsulated in the GroEL central cavity by GroES4–6. To determine the functional stoichiometry of GroEL, GroES and client protein in situ, here we visualized chaperonin complexes in their natural cellular environment using cryo-electron tomography. We find that, under various growth conditions, around 55–70% of GroEL binds GroES asymmetrically on one ring, with the remainder populating symmetrical complexes. Bound substrate protein is detected on the free ring of the asymmetrical complex, defining the substrate acceptor state. In situ analysis of GroEL–GroES chambers, validated by high-resolution structures obtained in vitro, showed the presence of encapsulated substrate protein in a folded state before release into the cytosol. Based on a comprehensive quantification and conformational analysis of chaperonin complexes, we propose a GroEL–GroES reaction cycle that consists of linked asymmetrical and symmetrical subreactions mediating protein folding.

 Mosquito-borne diseases affect hundreds of millions of people annually and disproportionately impact the developing world1,2. One mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, is a primary vector of viruses that cause dengue, yellow fever and Zika. The attraction of Ae. aegypti female mosquitos to humans requires integrating multiple cues, including CO2 from breath, organic odours from skin and visual cues, all sensed at mid and long ranges, and other cues sensed at very close range3–6. Here we identify a cue that Ae. aegypti use as part of their sensory arsenal to find humans. We demonstrate that Ae. aegypti sense the infrared (IR) radiation emanating from their targets and use this information in combination with other cues for highly effective mid-range navigation. Detection of thermal IR requires the heat-activated channel TRPA1, which is expressed in neurons at the tip of the antenna. Two opsins are co-expressed with TRPA1 in these neurons and promote the detection of lower IR intensities. We propose that radiant energy causes local heating at the end of the antenna, thereby activating temperature-sensitive receptors in thermosensory neurons. The realization that thermal IR radiation is an outstanding mid-range directional cue expands our understanding as to how mosquitoes are exquisitely effective in locating hosts.

10.1038/s41586-024-07822-1,The periosteum provides a stromal defence against cancer invasion into the bone,"Experiments in mouse models and histology of human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas show that TIMP1-mediated periosteal thickening in proximity to tumours acts as a barrier to cancer invasion of the bone. 
 The periosteum is the layer of cells that covers nearly the entire surface of every bone. Upon infection, injury or malignancy the bone surface undergoes new growth—the periosteal reaction—but the mechanism and physiological role of this process remain unknown1,2. Here we show that the periosteal reaction protects against cancer invasion into the bone. Histological analyses of human lesions of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) show that periosteal thickening occurs in proximity to the tumour. We developed a genetically dissectible mouse model of HNSCC and demonstrate that inducible depletion of periosteal cells accelerates cancerous invasion of the bone. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that expression of the gene encoding the protease inhibitor TIMP1 is markedly increased in the periosteum at the pre-invasive stage. This increase is due to upregulation of HIF1α expression in the tumour microenvironment, and increased TIMP1 inactivates matrix-degrading proteases, promoting periosteal thickening to inhibit cancer invasion. Genetic deletion of Timp1 impairs periosteal expansion, exacerbating bone invasion and decreasing survival in tumour-bearing mice. Together, these data show that the periosteal reaction may act as a functional stromal barrier against tumour progression, representing a unique example of tissue immunity mediated by stromal cells.

10.1038/s41586-024-07855-6,Stem cells tightly regulate dead cell clearance to maintain tissue fitness,"The spatiotemporal activation of phagocytosis by hair follicle cells is orchestrated by lipids released from surrounding apoptotic cells and retinoids released by healthy cells. 
 Billions of cells are eliminated daily from our bodies1–4. Although macrophages and dendritic cells are dedicated to migrating and engulfing dying cells and debris, many epithelial and mesenchymal tissue cells can digest nearby apoptotic corpses1–4. How these non-motile, non-professional phagocytes sense and eliminate dying cells while maintaining their normal tissue functions is unclear. Here we explore the mechanisms that underlie their multifunctionality by exploiting the cyclical bouts of tissue regeneration and degeneration during hair cycling. We show that hair follicle stem cells transiently unleash phagocytosis at the correct time and place through local molecular triggers that depend on both lipids released by neighbouring apoptotic corpses and retinoids released by healthy counterparts. We trace the heart of this dual ligand requirement to RARγ–RXRα, whose activation enables tight regulation of apoptotic cell clearance genes and provides an effective, tunable mechanism to offset phagocytic duties against the primary stem cell function of preserving tissue integrity during homeostasis. Finally, we provide functional evidence that hair follicle stem cell-mediated phagocytosis is not simply redundant with professional phagocytes but rather has clear benefits to tissue fitness. Our findings have broad implications for other non-motile tissue stem or progenitor cells that encounter cell death in an immune-privileged niche.

 Artificial neural networks, deep-learning methods and the backpropagation algorithm1 form the foundation of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. These methods are almost always used in two phases, one in which the weights of the network are updated and one in which the weights are held constant while the network is used or evaluated. This contrasts with natural learning and many applications, which require continual learning. It has been unclear whether or not deep learning methods work in continual learning settings. Here we show that they do not—that standard deep-learning methods gradually lose plasticity in continual-learning settings until they learn no better than a shallow network. We show such loss of plasticity using the classic ImageNet dataset and reinforcement-learning problems across a wide range of variations in the network and the learning algorithm. Plasticity is maintained indefinitely only by algorithms that continually inject diversity into the network, such as our continual backpropagation algorithm, a variation of backpropagation in which a small fraction of less-used units are continually and randomly reinitialized. Our results indicate that methods based on gradient descent are not enough—that sustained deep learning requires a random, non-gradient component to maintain variability and plasticity.

 Approximately 40% of the mammalian proteome undergoes N-terminal methionine excision and acetylation, mediated sequentially by methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) and N-acetyltransferase A (NatA), respectively1. Both modifications are strictly cotranslational and essential in higher eukaryotic organisms1. The interaction, activity and regulation of these enzymes on translating ribosomes are poorly understood. Here we perform biochemical, structural and in vivo studies to demonstrate that the nascent polypeptide-associated complex2,3 (NAC) orchestrates the action of these enzymes. NAC assembles a multienzyme complex with MetAP1 and NatA early during translation and pre-positions the active sites of both enzymes for timely sequential processing of the nascent protein. NAC further releases the inhibitory interactions from the NatA regulatory protein huntingtin yeast two-hybrid protein K4,5 (HYPK) to activate NatA on the ribosome, enforcing cotranslational N-terminal acetylation.

 Developmental myelination is a protracted process in the mammalian brain1. One theory for why oligodendrocytes mature so slowly posits that myelination may stabilize neuronal circuits and temper neuronal plasticity as animals age2–4. We tested this theory in the visual cortex, which has a well-defined critical period for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity5. During adolescence, visual experience modulated the rate of oligodendrocyte maturation in visual cortex. To determine whether oligodendrocyte maturation in turn regulates neuronal plasticity, we genetically blocked oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in adolescent mice. In adult mice lacking adolescent oligodendrogenesis, a brief period of monocular deprivation led to a significant decrease in visual cortex responses to the deprived eye, reminiscent of the plasticity normally restricted to adolescence. This enhanced functional plasticity was accompanied by a greater turnover of dendritic spines and coordinated reductions in spine size following deprivation. Furthermore, inhibitory synaptic transmission, which gates experience-dependent plasticity at the circuit level, was diminished in the absence of adolescent oligodendrogenesis. These results establish a critical role for oligodendrocytes in shaping the maturation and stabilization of cortical circuits and support the concept of developmental myelination acting as a functional brake on neuronal plasticity. Through genetic blocking of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in adolescent mice, we demonstrate that oligodendrocytes have a critical role in shaping the maturation and stabilization of visual cortical circuits.",Wendy Xin;Megumi Kaneko;Richard H.

 Conservation, restoration and land management are increasingly implemented at landscape scales1,2. However, because species interaction data are typically habitat- and/or guild-specific, exactly how those interactions connect habitats and affect the stability and function of communities at landscape scales remains poorly understood. We combine multi-guild species interaction data (plant–pollinator and three plant–herbivore–parasitoid communities, collected from landscapes with one, two or three habitats), a field experiment and a modelling approach to show that multi-habitat landscapes support higher species and interaction evenness, more complementary species interactions and more consistent robustness to species loss. These emergent network properties drive improved pollination success in landscapes with more habitats and are not explained by simply summing component habitat webs. Linking landscape composition, through community structure, to ecosystem function, highlights mechanisms by which several contiguous habitats can support landscape-scale ecosystem services.

10.1038/s41586-024-07835-w,Lysosomes drive the piecemeal removal of mitochondrial inner membrane,"We show that cytosolic inner mitochondrial membrane vesicles, devoid of outer mitochondrial membrane or mitochondrial matrix, are formed during resting state and directly herniate into lysosomes through pores formed by voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby allowing their selective removal. 
 Mitochondrial membranes define distinct structural and functional compartments. Cristae of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) function as independent bioenergetic units that undergo rapid and transient remodelling, but the significance of this compartmentalized organization is unknown1. Using super-resolution microscopy, here we show that cytosolic IMM vesicles, devoid of outer mitochondrial membrane or mitochondrial matrix, are formed during resting state. These vesicles derived from the IMM (VDIMs) are formed by IMM herniation through pores formed by voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Live-cell imaging showed that lysosomes in proximity to mitochondria engulfed the herniating IMM and, aided by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery, led to the formation of VDIMs in a microautophagy-like process, sparing the remainder of the organelle. VDIM formation was enhanced in mitochondria undergoing oxidative stress, suggesting their potential role in maintenance of mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the formation of VDIMs required calcium release by the reactive oxygen species-activated, lysosomal calcium channel, transient receptor potential mucolipin 1, showing an interorganelle communication pathway for maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Thus, IMM compartmentalization could allow for the selective removal of damaged IMM sections via VDIMs, which should protect mitochondria from localized injury. Our findings show a new pathway of intramitochondrial quality control.

 The elemental composition of the lunar surface provides insights into mechanisms of the formation and evolution of the Moon1,2. The chemical composition of lunar regolith have so far been precisely measured using the samples collected by the Apollo, Luna and Chang’e 5 missions, which are from equatorial to mid-latitude regions3,4; lunar meteorites, whose location of origin on the Moon is unknown5,6; and the in situ measurement from the Chang’e 3 and Chang’e 4 missions7–9, which are from the mid-latitude regions of the Moon.

The 23 measurements in the vicinity of the Chandrayaan-3 landing site show that the local lunar terrain in this region is fairly uniform and primarily composed of ferroan anorthosite (FAN), a product of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. However, observation of relatively higher magnesium abundance with respect to calcium in APXS measurements suggests the mixing of further mafic material. The compositional uniformity over a few tens of metres around the Chandrayaan-3 landing site provides an excellent ground truth for remote-sensing observations.

10.1038/s41586-024-07771-9,Attosecond delays in X-ray molecular ionization,"Time-resolved measurements of the X-ray photoemission delay of core-level electrons using attosecond soft X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser can be used to determine the complex correlated dynamics of photoionization. 
 The photoelectric effect is not truly instantaneous but exhibits attosecond delays that can reveal complex molecular dynamics1–7. Sub-femtosecond-duration light pulses provide the requisite tools to resolve the dynamics of photoionization8–12. Accordingly, the past decade has produced a large volume of work on photoionization delays following single-photon absorption of an extreme ultraviolet photon. However, the measurement of time-resolved core-level photoionization remained out of reach. The required X-ray photon energies needed for core-level photoionization were not available with attosecond tabletop sources. Here we report measurements of the X-ray photoemission delay of core-level electrons, with unexpectedly large delays, ranging up to 700 as in NO near the oxygen K-shell threshold. These measurements exploit attosecond soft X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser to scan across the entire region near the K-shell threshold. Furthermore, we find that the delay spectrum is richly modulated, suggesting several contributions, including transient trapping of the photoelectron owing to shape resonances, collisions with the Auger–Meitner electron that is emitted in the rapid non-radiative relaxation of the molecule and multi-electron scattering effects. The results demonstrate how X-ray attosecond experiments, supported by comprehensive theoretical modelling, can unravel the complex correlated dynamics of core-level photoionization.

10.1038/s41586-024-07779-1,Low-latitude mesopelagic nutrient recycling controls productivity and export,"To facilitate more accurate long-term projections of primary production and export over oceanic low latitudes (LLs), we identified the first-order importance of the temperature dependence of remineralization of the LL nutrient reservoir, with this serving to enhance LL mesopelagic retention under warming. 
 Low-latitude (LL) oceans account for up to half of global net primary production and export1–5. It has been argued that the Southern Ocean dominates LL primary production and export6, with implications for the response of global primary production and export to climate change7. Here we applied observational analyses and sensitivity studies to an individual model to show, instead, that 72% of LL primary production and 55% of export is controlled by local mesopelagic macronutrient cycling. A total of 34% of the LL export is sustained by preformed macronutrients supplied from the Southern Ocean via a deeper overturning cell, with a shallow preformed northward supply, crossing 30° S through subpolar and thermocline water masses, sustaining only 7% of the LL export. Analyses of five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, run under both high-emissions low-mitigation (shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP5-8.5)) and low-emissions high-mitigation (SSP1-2.6) climate scenarios for 1850–2300, revealed significant across-model disparities in their projections of not only the amplitude, but also the sign, of LL primary production. Under the stronger SSP5-8.5 forcing, with more substantial upper-ocean warming, the CMIP6 models that account for temperature-dependent remineralization promoted enhanced LL mesopelagic nutrient retention under warming, with this providing a first-order contribution to stabilizing or increasing, rather than decreasing, LL production under high emissions and low mitigation. This underscores the importance of a mechanistic understanding of mesopelagic remineralization and its sensitivity to ocean warming for predicting future ecosystem changes.

10.1038/s41586-024-07842-x,Neoarchaean oxygen-based nitrogen cycle en route to the Great Oxidation Event,"Observations of strongly positive nitrogen isotopic compositions of sedimentary rocks in the 2.68-Gyr-old shallow to deep marine sedimentary deposit of the Serra Sul Formation suggest that oxygenic photosynthesis predated the Great Oxidation Event. 
 The nitrogen isotopic composition of sedimentary rocks (δ15N) can trace redox-dependent biological pathways and early Earth oxygenation1,2. However, there is no substantial change in the sedimentary δ15N record across the Great Oxidation Event about 2.45 billion years ago (Ga)3, a prominent redox change. This argues for a temporal decoupling between the emergence of the first oxygen-based oxidative pathways of the nitrogen cycle and the accumulation of atmospheric oxygen after 2.45 Ga (ref. 3). The transition between both states shows strongly positive δ15N values (10–50‰) in rocks deposited between 2.8 Ga and 2.6 Ga, but their origin and spatial extent remain uncertain4,5. Here we report strongly positive δ15N values (>30‰) in the 2.68-Gyr-old shallow to deep marine sedimentary deposit of the Serra Sul Formation6, Amazonian Craton, Brazil. Our findings are best explained by regionally variable extents of ammonium oxidation to N2 or N2O tied to a cryptic oxygen cycle, implying that oxygenic photosynthesis was operating at 2.7 Ga. Molecular oxygen production probably shifted the redox potential so that an intermediate N cycle based on ammonium oxidation developed before nitrate accumulation in surface waters. We propose to name this period, when strongly positive nitrogen isotopic compositions are superimposed on the usual range of Precambrian δ15N values, the Nitrogen Isotope Event. We suggest that it marks the earliest steps of the biogeochemical reorganizations that led to the Great Oxidation Event. Observations of strongly positive nitrogen isotopic compositions of sedimentary rocks in the 2.68-Gyr-old shallow to deep marine sedimentary deposit of the Serra Sul Formation suggest that oxygenic photosynthesis predated the Great Oxidation Event.",Alice Pellerin;Christophe Thomazo;Magali Ader;Camille Rossignol;Eric Siciliano Rego;Vincent Busigny;Pascal Philippot,Nature,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注的是地球早期（27亿年前）的氮循环演化，并推测了氧气光合作用的出现时间。研究利用了沉积岩中氮同位素的分析结果，发现早期地球可能存在一个以铵氧化为主的氮循环，这表明氧气光合作用可能比之前认为的要早。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，因为它主要关注的是地球早期历史，而不是现代大气环境。
10.1038/s41586-024-07826-x,On-chip multi-degree-of-freedom control of two-dimensional materials,"An on-chip platform with in situ adjustable interfacial properties, using a microelectromechanical system, provides multi-degree-of-freedom control of two-dimensional materials, including twisting and pressurizing. 
 Two-dimensional materials (2DM) and their heterostructures offer tunable electrical and optical properties, primarily modifiable through electrostatic gating and twisting. Although electrostatic gating is a well-established method for manipulating 2DM, achieving real-time control over interfacial properties remains challenging in exploring 2DM physics and advanced quantum device technology1–6. Current methods, often reliant on scanning microscopes, are limited in their scope of application, lacking the accessibility and scalability of electrostatic gating at the device level. Here we introduce an on-chip platform for 2DM with in situ adjustable interfacial properties, using a microelectromechanical system (MEMS). This platform comprises compact and cost-effective devices with the ability of precise voltage-controlled manipulation of 2DM, including approaching, twisting and pressurizing actions. We demonstrate this technology by creating synthetic topological singularities, such as merons, in the nonlinear optical susceptibility of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)7–10. A key application of this technology is the development of integrated light sources with real-time and wide-range tunable polarization. Furthermore, we predict a quantum analogue that can generate entangled photon pairs with adjustable entanglement properties. Our work extends the abilities of existing technologies in manipulating low-dimensional quantum materials and paves the way for new hybrid two- and three-dimensional devices, with promising implications in condensed-matter physics, quantum optics and related fields.

 Glaciers archive time-structured information on climates and ecosystems, including microorganisms. However, the long-term ecogenomic dynamics or biogeography of the preserved viruses and their palaeoclimatic connections remain uninvestigated. Here we use metagenomes to reconstruct viral genomes from nine time horizons, spanning three cold-to-warm cycles over the past >41,000 years, preserved in an ice core from Guliya Glacier, Tibetan Plateau. We recover genomes of 1,705 approximately species-level viral operational taxonomic units. Viral communities significantly differ during cold and warm climatic conditions, with the most distinct community observed ~11,500 years ago during the major climate transition from the Last Glacial Stage to the Holocene. In silico analyses of virus–host interactions reveal persistently high viral pressure on Flavobacterium (a common dominant glacier lineage) and historical enrichment in the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins that can contribute to host adaptation and virus fitness under extreme conditions. Biogeographic analyses show that approximately one-fourth of Guliya viral operational taxonomic units overlap with the global dataset, primarily with the Tibetan Plateau metagenomes, suggesting regional associations of a subset of the Guliya-preserved viruses over time. We posit that the cold-to-warm variations in viral communities might be attributed to distinct virus sources and/or environmental selections under different temperature regimes.

10.1038/s41561-024-01520-3,Global patterns and drivers of post-fire vegetation productivity recovery,"More than 80% of vegetation burned globally regained its pre-fire level of productivity within 2 years, according to an assessment of post-fire vegetation productivity from 2004 to 2021. 
 Wildfires cause critical shifts in ecosystem functions, such as dramatic reductions in vegetation productivity. However, how fast vegetation regains its pre-fire productivity levels and the key influencing factors remain poorly understood on a global scale. Here we present the global estimates of post-fire vegetation productivity recovery from 2004 to 2021 using gross primary productivity observations and related proxies at a spatial resolution of 10 km, employing a random forest model to identify the key factors influencing recovery time. Roughly 87% of burned vegetation regained pre-fire productivity levels within 2 years, with evergreen needleleaf forests and savannas displaying the lengthiest recovery periods. During the recovery phase, post-fire climate conditions, such as soil moisture, vapour pressure deficit and air temperature, had nonlinear impacts on recovery time globally. These climatic factors exhibited a dominant role in regional recovery time in ~89% of the globally assessed area. As climate aridity decreased, the areas where recovery time was dominated by soil moisture and vapour pressure deficit decreased, while the influence of temperature increased. Soil-moisture-dominated regions witnessed reduced proportions of promoting vegetation recovery as aridity decreased, whereas vapour pressure deficit and air-temperature-dominated regions saw an increase in such proportions. Regions with strong human interventions were associated with accelerated vegetation recovery compared with similar ecosystems with smaller human interventions. These findings had important implications for global carbon-cycle assessments and fire-management strategies.

 The surface of Antarctica is continuously shaped by erosion, blowing snow and deposition, resulting in diverse aeolian bedforms akin to those observed in subtropical sand deserts. However, although dunes are universally recognized as a climate and environmental proxy, the properties of snow dunes are not well understood. Here, using satellite images covering most of Antarctica, we report the widespread occurrence (>95% of the area studied) of linear dunes that are between 100 and 1,000 m in length and aligned with the local resultant snow drift direction (61% are longitudinal dunes). On the basis of sand dune theory, we suggest that these snow dunes grow by elongation, often under unidirectional wind regimes. The predominance of the elongating mode indicates a low availability of mobile snow particles. This limited availability prevails at the continental scale due to a subtle balance between snow sintering, which limits erosion, and strong winds, which rapidly remove snowfall. These characteristics result from specific meteorological conditions that distinguish Antarctica from other snow-covered regions, and may shift with future climate changes. We suggest that snow sintering not only influences Antarctic aeolian landform evolution but also regulates the amount of snow sublimated during transport, an uncertain term in the ice-sheet mass balance. Linear aeolian dunes aligned in the direction of snow drift are widespread across Antarctica, indicating a limited supply of mobile snow particles controlled by snow sintering, according to an analysis of satellite imagery.",Marine Poizat;Ghislain Picard;Laurent Arnaud;Clément Narteau;Charles Amory;Fanny Brun,Nature Geoscience,TRUE,"['snow dunes', 'satellite imagery', 'atmospheric composition', 'snow sintering', 'wind regimes', 'ice-sheet mass balance']",这篇研究论文主要关注南极洲雪丘的形成和分布，利用卫星图像分析了雪丘的形态特征和形成机制。研究发现，南极洲广泛分布着线性雪丘，这些雪丘的形成受雪面烧结的影响，雪面烧结限制了可移动雪粒的供应，导致雪丘以拉长方式生长。研究还指出，雪面烧结不仅影响南极洲风成地貌的演化，也影响着雪在运输过程中的升华量，这对于冰盖质量平衡具有重要意义。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是在利用卫星图像分析大气成分、风场等信息方面。

 Terrestrial ecosystems are subjected to multiple global changes simultaneously. Yet, how an increasing number of global changes impact the resistance of ecosystems to global change remains virtually unknown. Here we present a global synthesis including 14,000 observations from seven ecosystem services (functions and biodiversity), as well as data from a 15-year field experiment. We found that the resistance of multiple ecosystem services to global change declines with an increasing number of global change factors, particularly after long-term exposure to these factors. Biodiversity had a higher resistance to multiple global changes compared with ecosystem functions. Our work suggests that we need to consider the combined effects of multiple global changes on the magnitude and resistance of ecosystem services worldwide, as ecosystem responses will be enhanced by the number of environmental stressors and time of exposure.

10.1038/s41561-024-01519-w,Nuna supercontinent assembly linked to carbon cycling in shear zones 1.9–1.7 billion years ago,"Graphitic carbon was hydrothermally cycled through shear zones during late-stage orogenesis associated with Nuna supercontinent assembly, according to a coupled rhenium–osmium and uranium–lead dating study. 
 A peak in organic carbon burial approximately 2.1–1.8 billion years ago led to the prolific growth of graphite-rich orogens internal to the supercontinent Nuna. The temporal history of graphitic carbon in such orogens, however, is poorly understood, which limits our understanding of the timescales of carbon cycling during orogenesis. Here we examine the graphitic roots of two North American (Laurentian) orogens associated with Nuna supercontinent assembly using coupled rhenium–osmium and uranium–lead dating. These are the Taltson–Snowbird orogeny, approximately 1.94–1.89 billion years ago, and the Trans-Hudson orogeny, approximately 1.84–1.72 billion years ago. The geochronology results show that the studied graphite, hosted in shear zones, predominantly reflects biogenic carbon that was hydrothermally remobilized during the final exhumation stages of orogenesis approximately 1.92–1.67 billion years ago. Our results demonstrate that graphite deposition occurred with a periodicity of 31 ± 4 million years and probably involved carbon cycling on the scale of 50 million tonnes or more over a 200 million year interval. Comparisons with other contemporaneous shear zones suggests that late-orogenic, fluid-mediated graphite deposition was common among Laurentian, and more broadly Nuna, mountain belts. These findings imply that the mass movement of graphitic carbon is an endemic feature of the orogenic cycle.

While existing studies have primarily focused on the immediate effects of COVID‐19‐induced isolation, less attention has been given to the enduring impacts on green space usage patterns. This study addresses this gap by conducting three comprehensive surveys in Dezhou, China—before, during, and after the first wave of social isolation (December 2019, March 2020, December 2020). These surveys assessed socioeconomic conditions, commuting habits, green space usage habits, and landscape preferences, specifically focusing on usage frequency, duration of stays, and activities undertaken. Using Mann‐Whitney U tests and Spearman's rho correlations, we identified significant long‐term changes, including an increase in the frequency of visits by previously infrequent users, a reduction in visit durations, and a rise in high‐intensity activities. These trends persisted 9 months post‐isolation, highlighting the pandemic's lasting impact on green space usage and its critical role in enhancing public health and pandemic preparedness through thoughtful urban environmental design.

10.1029/2024GH001142,Association Between Prenatal Exposure to Per‐ and Poly‐Fluoroalkyl Substances From Electronic Waste Disassembly Areas and Steroid Hormones in Human Milk Samples,"Per‐ and poly‐fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are long‐lasting environmental contaminants that are released into the environment during the e‐waste disassembly process, pose a threat to human health. Human milk is a complex and dynamic mixture of endogenous and exogenous substances, including steroid hormones and PFAS. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between PFAS and steroid hormones in human milk from women living close to an e‐waste disassembly area. In 2021, we collected milk samples from 150 mothers within 4 weeks of delivery and analyzed them via liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry to determine the levels of 21 perfluorinated compounds and five steroid hormones (estrone, estriol, testosterone, progesterone, and androstenedione [A‐dione]). We also performed multiple linear regression analysis to clarify the association between maternal PFAS exposure and steroid hormone concentrations. Our results indicated that PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with estrone (β, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08–0.39) and A‐dione (β, 0.186; 95% CI, 0.016–0.357) concentrations in human milk, respectively. Further, the average estimated daily intake of PFOA and PFOS were 36.5 ng/kg bw/day (range, 0.52–291.7 ng/kg bw/day) and 5.21 ng/kg bw/day (range, 0.26–32.3 ng/kg bw/day), respectively. Of concern, the PFAS intake of breastfeeding infants in the study area was higher than the recommended threshold. These findings suggested that prenatal exposure to PFAS from the e‐waste disassembly process can influence steroid hormones levels in human milk.

The bacterium cannot be eradicated from the aquatic environment, hence climate driven environmental conditions enhancing growth and dissemination of V. vulnificus need to be understood to provide preemptive assessment of its presence and distribution in aquatic systems. To achieve this objective, satellite remote sensing was employed to quantify the association of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll‐a (chl‐a) in locations with reported V. vulnificus infections. Monthly analysis was done in two populated regions of the Gulf of Mexico—Tampa Bay, Florida, and Galveston Bay, Texas. Results indicate warm water, characterized by a 2‐month lag in SST, high concentration of phytoplankton, proxied for zooplankton using 1 month lagged chl‐a values, was statistically linked to higher odds of V. vulnificus infection in the human population.

10.1029/2023GH000968,Air Pollution and Mortality in India: Investigating the Nexus of Ambient and Household Pollution Across Life Stages,"Air pollution in India is a foremost environmental risk factor that affects human health. This study first investigates the geographical distribution of ambient and household air pollution (HAP) and then examines the associated mortality risk. Data on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration has been extracted from the Greenhouse Gas Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model. HAP, mortality and socio‐demographic data were extracted from the National Family and Health Survey‐5, India, 2019–2021. Regression models were applied to see the difference in age‐group mortality by different pollution parameters. The districts with PM2.5 concentration above the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) level of 40 μg/m3 show a higher risk of neonatal (OR‐1.86, CI 1.418–2.433), postneonatal (OR‐2.04, CI 1.399–2.971), child (OR‐2.19, CI 0.999–4.803) and adult death (OR‐1.13, CI 1.060–1.208). The absence of a separate kitchen shows a higher probability of neonatal (OR: 1.18, CI 1.074–1.306) and adult death (OR‐1.06, CI 1.027–1.088). The interaction between PM2.5 levels above NAAQS and HAP leads to a substantial rise in mortality observed for neonatal (OR 1.19 CI 1.051–1.337), child (OR 1.17 CI 1.054–1.289), and adult (OR 1.13 CI 1.096–1.168) age groups. This study advocates that there is a strong positive association between ambient and HAP and mortality risk. PM2.5 pollution significantly contributes to the mortality risk in all age groups. Children are more vulnerable to HAP than adults. In India, policymakers should focus on reducing the anthropogenic PM2.5 emission at least to reach the NAAQS, which can substantially reduce disease burden and, more precisely, mortality.",Mihir Adhikary;Nandita Saikia;Pallav Purohit;Vladimir Canudas‐Romo;Wolfgang Schöpp,GeoHealth,TRUE,"['air quality monitoring', 'PM2.5', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",该研究主要关注印度的空气污染问题，并探讨了环境空气污染和家庭空气污染对不同年龄段人群死亡率的影响。研究使用了GAINS模型获取PM2.5浓度数据，并结合印度国家家庭健康调查数据分析了空气污染与死亡率之间的关系。研究结果表明，PM2.5浓度超过国家环境空气质量标准的地区，新生儿、婴儿、儿童和成年人的死亡风险均较高。研究还发现，家庭空气污染也对死亡率有显著影响，尤其是新生儿和成年人。该研究表明，环境空气污染和家庭空气污染对印度人群的死亡率有显著影响，并强调了控制空气污染的重要性。

As for other countries of Southern Europe, Spain is a region highly affected by heat and its increase under climate change. This is observed in the mean values and the increasing incidence of extreme weather events and associated mortality. Despite the vast knowledge on this topic, it remains unclear whether specific types and characteristics of HW are particularly harmful to the population and whether this shows a regional interdependency. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between HW characteristics and mortality in 12 Spanish cities. We used separated time series analysis in each city applying a quasi‐Poisson regression model and distributed lag linear and non‐linear models. Results show an increase in the mortality risk under HW conditions in the cities with a lower HW frequency. However, this increase exhibits remarkable differences across the cities under study not showing any general pattern in the HW characteristics‐mortality association.

10.1029/2024GH001042,"Source Attribution of Health Burdens From Ambient PM2.5, O3, and NO2 Exposure for Assessment of South Korean National Emission Control Scenarios by 2050","We quantify anthropogenic sources of health burdens associated with ambient air pollution exposure in South Korea and forecast future health burdens using domestic emission control scenarios by 2050 provided by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Our health burden estimation framework uses GEOS‐Chem simulations, satellite‐derived NO2, and ground‐based observations of PM2.5, O3, and NO2. We estimate 19,000, 3,300, and 8,500 premature deaths owing to long‐term exposure to PM2.5, O3, and NO2, respectively, and 23,000 NO2‐associated childhood asthma incidences in 2016. Next, we calculate anthropogenic emission contributions to these four health burdens from each species and grid cell using adjoint sensitivity analysis. Domestic sources account for 56%, 38%, 87%, and 88% of marginal emission contributions to the PM2.5‐, O3‐, and NO2‐associated premature deaths and the NO2‐associated childhood asthma incidences, respectively. We project health burdens to 2050 using UNEP domestic emission scenarios (Baseline and Mitigation) and population forecasts from Statistics Korea. Because of population aging alone, there are 41,000, 10,000, and 20,000 more premature deaths associated with PM2.5, O3, and NO2 exposure, respectively, and 9,000 fewer childhood asthma incidences associated with NO2. The Mitigation scenario doubles the NO2‐associated health benefits over the Baseline scenario, preventing 24,000 premature deaths and 13,000 childhood asthma incidences by 2050. It also slightly reduces PM2.5‐ and O3‐associated premature deaths by 9.9% and 7.0%, unlike the Baseline scenario where these pollutants increase.

10.1029/2024GH001058,Ozone Mortality Burden Changes Driven by Population Aging and Regional Inequity in China in 2013–2050,"Air pollution exposure is closely linked to population age and socioeconomic status. Population aging and imbalance in regional economy are thus anticipated to have important implications on ozone (O3)‐related health impacts. Here we provide a driver analysis for O3 mortality burden due to respiratory disease in China over 2013–2050 driven by population aging and regional inequity. Unexpectedly, we find that population aging is estimated to result in dramatic rises in annual O3 mortality burden in China; by 56, 101–137, and 298–485 thousand over the periods 2013–2020, 2020–2030, and 2030–2050, respectively. This reflects the exponential rise in baseline mortality rates with increasing age. The aging‐induced mortality burden rise in 2030–2050 is surprisingly large, as it is comparable to the net national mortality burden due to O3 exposure in 2030 (359–399 thousand yr−1). The health impacts of O3 pollution, shown as mortality burden per capita, are inequitably distributed, with more severe effects in less developed provinces than their developed counterparts by 23.1% and 21.5% in 2019 and 2030, respectively. However, the regional inequity in O3 mortality burden is expected to be mitigated in 2050.

However, there is limited understanding regarding the structure and physical properties of Fe‐C‐N alloys under extreme conditions. Here diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted, revealing the stability of hexagonal‐structured Fe7(N0.75C0.25)3 up to 120 GPa and 2100 K, without undergoing any structural transformation or dissociation. Notably, the thermal expansion coefficient and Grüneisen parameter of the alloy exhibit a collapse at 55–70 GPa. First‐principles calculations suggest that such anomaly is associated with the spin transition of iron within Fe7(N0.75C0.25)3. Our modeling indicates that the presence of ∼1.0 wt% carbon and nitrogen in liquid iron contributes to 9–12% of the density deficit of the Earth's outer core.

We assess how fault location error (rupture‐to‐fault separation distance) and coseismic displacement residual (difference between observed and predicted coseismic displacement) vary with tectonic landform and lithologic age for four historical earthquakes. Certain tectonic landforms identified before these earthquakes correlate with lower fault location errors and median displacements below model predictions.

10.1029/2024GL111115,Distribution and Cycling of Nickel and Nickel Isotopes in the Pacific Ocean,"Nickel stable isotopes (δ60Ni) provide insight to Ni biogeochemistry in the modern and past oceans. Here, we present the first Pacific Ocean high‐resolution dissolved Ni concentration and δ60Ni data, from the US GEOTRACES GP15 cruise. As in other ocean basins, increases in δ60Ni toward the surface ocean are observed across the entire transect, reflecting preferential biological uptake of light Ni isotopes, however the observed magnitude of fractionation is larger in the tropical Pacific than the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Such surface ocean fractionation by phytoplankton should accumulate isotopically lighter Ni in the deep Pacific, yet we find that North Pacific deep ocean δ60Ni is similar to previously reported values from the deep Atlantic.

10.1029/2023GL107310,Lessons From Transient Simulations of the Last Deglaciation With CLIMBER‐X: GLAC1D Versus PaleoMist,"The last deglaciation experienced the retreat of massive ice sheets and a transition from the cold Last Glacial Maximum to the warmer Holocene. Key simulation challenges for this period include the timing and extent of ice sheet decay and meltwater input into the oceans. Here, major uncertainties and forcing factors for the last deglaciation are evaluated. Two sets of transient simulations are performed based on the novel ice‐sheet reconstruction PaleoMist and the more established GLAC1D. The simulations reveal that the proximity of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to a bifurcation point, where it can switch between on‐ and off‐modes, is primarily determined by the interplay of greenhouse gas concentrations, orbital forcing and freshwater forcing.

To reveal the mainshock early process, we relocated the earthquake hypocenters and found that many key phenomena, including the mainshock initiation, foreshocks, swarm earthquakes, and deep aseismic slip, occurred at parts of a previously unrecognized fault in intricate fault network. This fault is subparallel (several kilometers deeper) to a known active fault, and the mainshock initiation and foreshocks occurred at the front of a 2‐year westward swarm migration. The initiation location coincides with the destination of the upward migration of a deeper earthquake cluster via several smaller faults. Fluid supply, small earthquakes, and aseismic slip on the fault likely triggered the mainshock, leading to the first major rupture at the western region, propagating further to the west and east sides, resulting in an Mw7.5 event, exceeding 100 km in length.",Keisuke Yoshida;Ryota Takagi;Yo Fukushima;Ryosuke Ando;Yusaku Ohta;Yoshihiro Hiramatsu,Geophysical Research Letters,FALSE,[],这篇论文研究的是2024年日本能登半岛地震，主要关注地震发生前后的地质活动，包括地震震源、前震、地震群和深部无震滑移等现象。论文通过重新定位地震震源，发现地震发生在一条之前未被识别的断层上，并分析了该断层与地震发生之间的关系。因此，这篇论文主要属于地质学领域，与大气环境遥感技术没有直接关联。

Robust forecast skill windows are identified based on the subseasonal‐seasonal reforecast database, during which the majority of models show high forecast skills. A total of 15 MJO forecast skill windows during 1993–2020 have been identified. Most of the forecast skill windows are closely associated with active MJO events with high amplitude. Whether a high‐skill forecast window appears significantly depends on the magnitude of MJO intensity during the same period. The maintenance of active strong MJO events is potentially related with the warmer surface sea temperature anomalies in the western Pacific.

Previous studies have suggested ice cloud water or non‐convective precipitation as a predictor of RI from different perspectives. However, few studies have focused on the impact of TC intensity or comprehensive comparisons to identify better indicators. During RI, hydrometeor contents in weak TCs increase over the entire region, whereas they increase mainly in the inner‐core region and decrease in advance in the outer‐core region for strong TCs. Hydrometeor contents in the inner‐core are higher in RI than in slow intensification, and their maxima location is related to TC intensity and intensification rate. Cloud water path (CWP) in the inner‐core region is most correlated with the intensification rate, especially in weak TCs. Therefore, the CWP can serve as a predictor of RI and can be applied to all TC intensities.",Yuankang Leng;Rui Liu;Peijun Zhu;Honglei Zhang,Geophysical Research Letters,TRUE,"['satellite observations', 'GPM GMI', 'tropical cyclone', 'hydrometeor', 'rapid intensification', 'cloud water path']",该研究利用卫星数据分析了热带气旋快速增强过程中的降水粒子演变及其与气旋强度的关系。研究发现，弱气旋快速增强时，整个区域的降水粒子含量都会增加，而强气旋快速增强时，降水粒子含量主要在核心区域增加，而在外围区域提前减少。核心区域的降水粒子含量在快速增强过程中高于缓慢增强过程中，其最大值位置与气旋强度和增强速率有关。核心区域的云水路径与增强速率最相关，尤其是在弱气旋中。因此，云水路径可以作为快速增强的预测指标，并适用于所有气旋强度。

Hourly dust plume observations of the Dust Belt from geostationary‐orbit satellites are analyzed for the 2017‐12–2022‐11 period. To identify dust source areas and their extents, we back‐track plumes to their source, assessing source areas in terms of emission frequency, contribution, and plume extent patterns. This method advances over traditional source allocation techniques that rely on polar‐orbiting satellites based on a few daily passes and meteorological wind fields for backtracking. Our findings indicate that Boreal summer is the most intense season for most sources, except in the Southern Sahara, which experiences winterly winds.

However, there is no consensus yet on how these folds form. Here, we use the full‐Stokes code Underworld2 to simulate ice movements in three‐dimensional convergent flow, mainly considering ice anisotropy due to a crystallographic preferred orientation, vertical viscosity and density gradients in ice layers, and bedrock topography. Our simulated folds show complex patterns and are classified into: large‐scale folds (>100 m amplitude), small‐scale folds (<<100 m) and basal‐shear folds. The amplitudes of large‐scale folds tend to be at their maximum in the middle of the ice column or just below, in accordance with observations in RES data. We conclude that ice anisotropy amplifies the perturbations in ice layers (mainly due to bedrock topography) into large‐scale folds during flow. Density differences between the warm deep ice and cold ice above may enhance fold amplification.",Yu Zhang;Till Sachau;Steven Franke;Haibin Yang;Dian Li;Ilka Weikusat;Paul D.

We study IAW occurrence statistically at different heliocentric distances using Solar Orbiter to identify the processes responsible for IAW generation near IP shocks. We show that close to IP shocks the occurrence rate of IAW increases and peaks at the ramp. In the upstream region, the IAW activity is highly variable among different shocks and increases with decreasing distance from the Sun.

However, the tectonic nature of the southeastern CAOB remains controversial, which complicates the reconstruction of the Paleo‐Asian Ocean. To address this issue, a deep seismic reflection survey was initiated across the southeastern CAOB and reveals broad gentle sub‐horizontal reflectors in the middle‐lower crust and a relatively transparent zone in the upper crust. Combining with the Precambrian geological outcrops and other geophysical features, we support a microcontinental block, the Xilinhot Block, existed in the Paleo‐Asian domain. Thus, the Paleo‐Asian Ocean was separated into two branches that underwent north‐dipping and double‐dipping oceanic plate subduction, respectively, to form the Hegenshan‐Heihe and Solonker sutures.

These waves radiate globally as swell, generating microseisms and affecting coastal areas. Despite their significance, long waves often elude detection by existing remote sensing systems when their height is below 0.2 m. The new Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite offers a breakthrough by resolving these waves in global sea level measurements. Here we show that SWOT can detect 25‐s waves with heights as low as 3 cm, and resolves period and direction better than in situ buoys. SWOT provides detailed maps of wave height, wavelength, and direction across ocean basins. These measurements unveil intricate spatial patterns, shedding light on wave generation in storms, currents that influence propagation, and refraction, diffraction and reflection in shallow regions.

However, their physical properties, including those influencing fault slip accumulation and release and earthquake‐related surface displacements, are still poorly constrained at critical depths. Here, we combine seismic imaging and geodetic modeling to investigate the structure and mechanical behavior of the Main Himalayan Thrust fault (MHT) in the center of the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha rupture in Nepal. Our results from two independent observations consistently suggest the presence of a channel associated with the MHT with high compliance (shear modulus as low as ∼4 GPa) and strain anisotropy (stiffer in the vertical orientation than in the horizontal), likely arising from a weak subducting layer with north‐dipping foliation.

To better assess its climate impact in China, we develop an explicit BrC scheme and implement it in a global climate model, which includes optical parameters of primary BrC derived from local measurements, secondary BrC absorption, and a photobleaching parameterization of BrC. By comparing with multi‐type observational data, we find that with the implementation of this scheme, the model captures the seasonal variations of BrC light absorption well in China.

The circulation analogs‐based dynamic adjustment reveals that approximately 38% and 35% of these trends result from shifts in zonal dipolar circulation patterns over the North Atlantic (NA) and Europe, crucial for the enhanced warming compared to the global land average. The circulation changes are associated with warming sea surface temperatures in the NA. This warming pattern resembles the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and is predominantly induced by greenhouse gases.

It was found that the extreme precipitation preferentially occurred in the YHRB during the easterly phase of the QBO (EQBO) compared to the westerly phase of the QBO (WQBO). This was primarily because the BSISO was more prone to cause rainfall extremes in the YHRB during the EQBO summers than during the WQBO summers.

Here, we show that the overflow volume transport remained stable from 1996 to 2022, but that the bottom water warmed at an average rate of 0.1°C per decade, mainly caused by warming of deep waters upstream. The salinity of the overflow water has increased as a lagged and reduced response to the salinity increase seen in the upper‐layer source waters. Therefore, the potential density of the bottom water over the FBC sill shows no statistically significant trend. After entrainment of warmer ambient waters downstream of the FBC, the nonlinear density dependence upon temperature implies, however, that the overflow contributed water of reduced density to the local overturning and the deep limb of the AMOC.",Karin Margretha Húsgarð Larsen;Bogi Hansen;Hjálmar Hátún;Guðrið Eriksdóttir Johansen;Svein Østerhus;Steffen Malskær Olsen,Geophysical Research Letters,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要研究了法罗群岛海峡的冷水溢出，其是北大西洋经向翻转环流 (AMOC) 的重要组成部分。研究发现，溢出水的体积输送量在 1996 年至 2022 年间保持稳定，但底部水温以每十年 0.1°C 的速度升温，这主要是由于上游深水变暖造成的。溢出水的盐度有所增加，这是对上层源水盐度增加的滞后和减弱的反应。因此，法罗群岛海峡门槛上底部水的潜在密度没有表现出统计学上的显著趋势。然而，在法罗群岛海峡门槛下游，由于与周围较暖水体的混合，温度对密度的非线性依赖意味着溢出水对局部翻转和 AMOC 深层分支贡献了密度较低的的水。
10.1029/2024GL109466,Separate the Role of Southern and Northern Extra‐Tropical Pacific in Tropical Pacific Climate Variability,"Observational and modeling studies have elucidated the influential role played by the southern and northern extratropical Pacific (SEP and NEP) forcing in shaping dynamics of tropical Pacific climate variability. However, the relative importance of the NEP and SEP and the timescale on which they impact the tropics remain unclear. Using a linear inverse model (LIM) that selectively incorporates or excludes tropical‐extratropical coupling, we find a reduction in tropical interannual variability (∼40%) and low‐frequency (sub‐decadal to decadal) variability in the southeastern tropical Pacific region (∼70%) in the absence of SEP. Conversely, the absence of NEP yields no significant impact on tropical interannual variability but markedly diminishes low‐frequency variability in the central tropical Pacific region (∼70%). LIM and statistic diagnostics on CMIP6 models show the low‐frequency to total variability ratio in the tropical Pacific depending on their NEP and SEP representation. Models with more (less) low‐frequency power tend to show stronger NEP (SEP) dynamics.",Yingying Zhao;Daoxun Sun;Emanuele Di Lorenzo;Guangpeng Liu;Sheng Wu,Geophysical Research Letters,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要研究了南、北太平洋中纬度地区对热带太平洋气候变率的影响。论文使用了线性反演模型，分析了南、北太平洋中纬度地区对热带太平洋年际和低频变率的影响。研究发现，南太平洋中纬度地区对热带太平洋年际变率和东南热带太平洋地区的低频变率有显著影响，而北太平洋中纬度地区则对热带太平洋年际变率没有显著影响，但对中热带太平洋地区的低频变率有显著影响。论文还分析了CMIP6模式中热带太平洋低频变率与南、北太平洋中纬度地区动力学的关系。总体而言，这篇论文主要关注的是气候变化和海洋动力学，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

The forecasts demonstrate skill in addition to that from the long‐term trend, and that skill is primarily attributable to ENSO. However, the skill varies seasonally, with skill being lowest for target periods during Northern Hemisphere summer. Single model ensembles show underdispersion at short leads, while the multi‐model ensemble is overdispersed, suggesting initial condition errors and highlighting the importance of model initialization for quantification of forecast uncertainty.

To identify their magnetospheric drivers, we employ the MAGE (Multiscale Atmosphere‐Geospace Environment) model in a case study of a geomagnetic storm for which there were spacecraft‐ and ground‐based observations of GUs. The model reproduces the spatial and temporal scales of the GUs as well as the presence of duskside subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) and plasmapause undulations. Based on our modeling, we are able to identify the magnetospheric drivers of GUs as mesoscale ring current injections which, after drifting westward, create inverted regions of flux‐tube entropy (FTE) and subsequent interchange instability. Outward‐protruding interchange fingers disrupt shielding of the inner magnetosphere, creating longitudinally localized ripples in magnetospheric convection equatorward of the magnetospheric instability, which structure the plasmapause and duskside diffuse precipitation.

Hence, it is desirable to predict before SSW onset if an event will propagate downward. The predictability of the downward response of SSWs is considered in seven subseasonal‐to‐seasonal forecast models for 16 major SSWs between 1998 and 2022, a larger sample size than considered by previous works. The models successfully predict before SSW onset which SSWs have a stronger downward response to 100 hPa, however they struggle to predict which have a stronger tropospheric response. The downward response is stronger if the magnitude of the deceleration of the 10 hPa winds is more accurately predicted. Downward response is stronger for split and absorbing SSWs. In contrast, there is little relationship between SSWs whose onset can be predicted at earlier leads and the downward response.",David M. Nebel;Chaim I. Garfinkel;Judah Cohen;Daniela I. V.

Typhoon Hinnamnor (2022) weakened and re‐intensified as it approached the Korean Strait, interacting with an underlying MHW in the northern East China Sea (nECS). In‐situ observations and reanalysis products revealed a significant increase in latent heat loss from the nECS during the MHW period, contributing to the typhoon re‐intensification. Strong sea surface wind forcing with the typhoon enhanced vertical mixing and upwelling, resulting in a pronounced (0.90°C) sea surface cooling after the typhoon passage, facilitating MHW disappearance with reduced thermal stratification. During MHWs, increased background stratification increases temperature oscillations associated with semidiurnal internal tides. Furthermore, post‐typhoon changes in stratification weakened semidiurnal internal tides due to unfavorable conditions for generation from a nearby source.

Sediment connectivity refers to the hypothesis that pathways of sediment transport do not occur in isolation, but rather are mechanistically linked. In dryland river systems, one such example of sediment connectivity is the transport of fluvially deposited sediment by wind. However, predictive tools that can forecast fluvial‐aeolian sediment connectivity at meaningful scales are rare. Here we develop a suite of models for quantifying the availability of river‐sourced sediment for aeolian transport as a function of river flow, wind regime, and land cover across 168 km of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, USA.

Here we show DLFEs in the Tengchong Volcano Field, southeast Tibet, located ∼300 km from the Indo‐Burma volcanic arc, by analyzing a 12‐year continuous seismic data set. The earthquakes were at a depth of ∼12 km, near the sidewall of the magma body detected by the magnetotelluric survey. The features of isotropic focal mechanism, episodic occurrence, and possible non‐power‐law scaling, with no detectable geodetic deformation, as well as the petrological signatures of the Holocene eruption product, suggest that the earthquakes were likely associated with the weak intermittent magma flows near the magma body. This finding may demonstrate the existence of unsteady magmatic processes in the margin of the Indo‐Eurasia collision zone, which could indicate unneglectable volcanic hazards, underestimated geothermal resources, and mineralization processes in similar regions.",Jieming Niu;Xin Wang;Qi‐Fu Chen;Jinzhong Jiang;Zigang Sun;Yan Wang;Qinghua Huang,Geophysical Research Letters,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要研究了位于东南西藏腾冲火山区的深低频地震（DLFE）。研究发现，这些地震发生在约12公里深的地下，靠近磁测探测到的岩浆体侧壁。论文认为，这些地震可能与岩浆体附近间歇性弱岩浆流动有关。该研究结果表明，印度-欧亚碰撞带边缘存在不稳定的岩浆过程，这可能意味着该地区存在不可忽视的火山灾害、被低估的地热资源和矿化过程。这篇论文主要关注地质学和火山学，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

This wetting trend aligns with the future projections of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The observationally constrained reanalysis data indicates that significant sea surface warming in the western equatorial Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea is likely driving this increase in rainfall by enhancing the cross‐equatorial monsoonal flow and associated evaporation. We demonstrate that the strengthening of the cross‐equatorial monsoon winds is due to the rapid warming of the Indian Ocean and the enhanced Pacific Ocean trade winds, which result from the poleward shift and expansion of the Hadley cell. These strengthened winds boost the latent heat flux (evaporation), leading to increased moisture transport to Northwest India.",Ligin Joseph;Nikolaos Skliris;Dipanjan Dey;Robert Marsh;Joël Hirschi,Geophysical Research Letters,TRUE,"['monsoon rainfall', 'satellite observations', 'climate change', 'Hadley cell', 'Indian Ocean warming', 'sea surface temperature']",这篇论文研究了1979年至2022年间印度西北部夏季季风降雨量的增加趋势。研究表明，印度洋西部赤道和阿拉伯海的海面温度升高是导致降雨量增加的主要原因。论文利用了再分析数据和CMIP6模型，分析了印度洋变暖、哈德利环流的极移和扩张以及跨赤道季风风力的增强对降雨量的影响。论文使用了卫星观测数据来研究海面温度变化和季风风力的变化，并利用数值模型来模拟气候变化对降雨量的影响。

Using nine model simulations from the PMIP3, we study the IOD variability during the LM after due validation of the simulated current day (CE 1850–2005) IOD variability. Majority of the models simulate relatively higher number of positive IOD events during the MWP, and negative IOD events in the LIA, commensurate with simulated background conditions. However, higher number of strong positive IOD events are simulated relative to the negative IODs during the LIA, in agreement with proxy‐observations, apparently owing to increased coupled feedback during positive IODs.",Charan Teja Tejavath;Karumuri Ashok;Supriyo Chakraborty;Sreenivas Pentakota,Geophysical Research Letters,FALSE,"['Indian Ocean Dipole', 'climate variability', 'proxy data', 'climate modeling']",这篇论文主要研究的是印度洋偶极子 (IOD) 在过去一千年的变化趋势，利用了 PMIP3 气候模式的模拟结果，并与代理观测数据进行了比较。论文重点关注 IOD 在小冰期和中世纪暖期这两个气候阶段的变化特征，以及模式模拟结果与观测数据的差异。总体而言，论文属于气候变化研究范畴，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

To better understand these responses, more examples are needed to assess how tree growth rates react to abrupt changes in growing‐season temperatures. Here we use a natural experiment in which a glacier's fluctuations exposed a temperate rainforest to changes in summer temperatures of similar magnitude to those predicted to occur by 2050. We hypothesized that the onset of glacier‐accentuated temperature trends would act to increase the variance in stand‐level tree growth rates, a proxy for forest net primary productivity. Instead, dendrochronological records reveal that the growth rates of five, co‐occurring conifer species became less synchronous, and this diversification of species responses acted to reduce the variance and to increase the stability of community‐wide growth rates. These results warrant further inquiry into how climate‐induced changes in tree‐growth diversity may help stabilize future ecosystem services like forest carbon storage.",B. V. Gaglioti;D. H. Mann;G.

Yet, the stable phase and exact amount of MgO exsolution remain elusive. Here we utilize an iterative learning scheme to develop a unified deep learning interatomic potential for the Mg‐Fe‐O system valid over a wide pressure‐temperature range. This potential enables direct, large‐scale simulations of MgO exsolution processes at the Earth's core‐mantle boundary. Our results suggest that Mg exsolve in the form of crystalline Fe‐poor ferropericlase as opposed to a liquid MgO component presumed previously. The solubility of Mg in the core is limited, and the present‐day core is nearly Mg‐free.

This study demonstrates that this approach may significantly bias the computed flood frequency change. An idealized experiment shows frequency bias exceeding 100% for a 50‐year base period. Further analyses using Monte Carlo simulations, mathematical derivations, and hydrological model outputs reveal that bias magnitude inversely relates to base period length and is weakly influenced by the generalized extreme value distribution's shape parameter. The bias, persisting across different estimation methods, implies floods may exceed local defenses designed based on short historical records more often than expected, even without climate change. We introduce a frequency bias adjustment method, which significantly reduces the projected rise in global flood occurrence.

But how to factor in the urban form into the UHI assessment remains unresolved. We propose an every‐pair‐interaction model that meaningfully incorporates urban size and fractal dimension to characterize the UHI intensity. Regression on the summertime surface UHI intensity of 5,000 European cities shows that the model outperforms the simple linear combination of logarithmic size and fractal dimension. Subject to the interplay between the range of the every‐pair interaction and the urban fractal shape, the model also represents a generalization as it includes power‐law, logarithmic, and saturating size dependence of UHI—all three possibilities have been reported empirically in the literature.

Here, we attribute this drying to the weakened subtropical westerlies and deflected by the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Climatologically, the low‐level southwesterlies at the southeastern margin of the TP, a branch of the upstream subtropical westerly jet deflected by the TP terrain, bring water vapor to SEC and the southerlies move upward over SEC mainly through isentropic gliding mechanism, inducing persistent precipitation in early spring. However, the subtropical westerlies weakened significantly in recent decades due potentially to the decreased Eurasian snow cover. Consequently, an easterly trend appears along the southern margin of the TP with anomalous northeasterlies over SEC. These northeasterlies suppress both moisture supply and upward motions over SEC, and reduce regional early spring precipitation.

Spring (March‐April‐May) weather strongly influences Upper Colorado River streamflow because it controls not only water input but also when snow melts and how much energy is available for evaporation when soils are wettest. Since 2000, spring precipitation decreased by 14% on average across 26 unregulated headwater basins, but this decrease did not fully account for the reduced streamflow. In drier springs, increases in energy from reduced cloud cover, and lowered surface albedo from earlier snow disappearance, coincided with potential evapotranspiration (PET) increases of up to 10%. Combining spring precipitation decreases with PET increases accounted for 67% of the variance in post‐2000 streamflow deficits. Streamflow deficits were most substantial in lower elevation basins (<2,950 m), where snowmelt occurred earliest, and precipitation declines were largest.

10.1029/2024GL110317,Future Changes in the Winter Beaufort High Under Warming Climate Scenarios,"We show that the winter Beaufort High (BH) index defined by sea level pressure (SLP) has a robust negative trend under the scenarios SSP5‐8.5 and SSP2‐4.5, with a reduction by about 5 hPa and 2 hPa, respectively, by the end of the 21st century. The negative trends in the BH SLP are associated with the changes in the background SLP over the Arctic basin. However, the vorticity of the winter BH tends to intensify under SSP5‐8.5, but shows no robust increase under SSP2‐4.5. The intensification is associated with the enhanced ridge over the Western Arctic. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the dynamic aspects of the BH, such as vorticity. Based on this assessment, under the most likely emissions scenario, the winter BH is likely to weaken through the 21st century, in terms of SLP, but shows no robust changes in term of vorticity.",Minghong Zhang;William Perrie;Zhenxia Long,Geophysical Research Letters,TRUE,"['sea level pressure', 'satellite observations', 'climate change']",这篇论文研究了北极冬季博福特高压在未来气候变化情景下的变化趋势。研究者利用了海平面气压数据，并结合了不同排放情景下的气候模型模拟结果，分析了博福特高压强度和位置的未来变化。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为海平面气压是通过卫星观测获得的，而气候模型模拟也依赖于卫星数据和大气成分分析。

The goal of this study is to understand how ETCs are changing within a warming climate. Historical GLR cyclone characteristics from 1959 to 2021 are examined using a storm tracking algorithm and the ERA‐5 atmospheric reanalysis. Of the 886 cyclones identified, half are the large long‐track cyclones that are typically included in ETC studies, and half are smaller short‐track cyclones that, while not always considered in ETC studies, still have an important impact on the GLR with significant precipitation trends.

While this is partly due to biases between the models and observations, we propose that another uncertainty is rooted in the choice of statistic used to determine the ‘jet latitude’ — one measure used to quantify the jet position. We use seven different jet latitude statistics, four climate reanalysis products, and CMIP6 simulations to assess the relative importance of different uncertainties associated with lower‐tropospheric North Pacific Jet (NPJ) trends. Our results show a statistically significant poleward trend in the observed winter NPJ across all reanalyzes and using all jet latitude statistics. The magnitude of this trend is most sensitive to the choice of statistic.

Here, we quantified forest resilience with optimized Bayesian models. With the use of multisource satellite and modeling data, our study revealed that forests on the Loess Plateau and in the Qinba Mountains in China are experiencing rapid resilience loss and are already facing mortality warnings after 2010. Reductions in resilience also drove the marked decoupling of GPP from EPE. Notably, the decline in resilience was accompanied by a decrease in EPE in about 74% of the forests while GPP increased. The mechanism underlying this decoupling could be attributed to enhanced atmospheric water demand and soil water constraints. The dynamic relationships found here could help to improve forest mortality models and enhance photosynthesis‐based GPP evaluation.",Yu Zhang;Xiaohong Liu;Lixin Wang;Xiaomin Zeng;Liangju Zhao;Xiuchen Wu;Zhaohui Luo;Jianwu Yan;Yixue Hong;Xing Li;Jingfeng Xiao,Geophysical Research Letters,TRUE,"['satellite observations', 'GPP', 'photosynthetic efficiency', 'forest resilience']",该研究利用多源卫星和模型数据，评估了中国黄土高原和秦巴山区的森林恢复力，发现森林恢复力下降导致了森林初级生产力（GPP）与光合效率（EPE）之间的脱耦。研究表明，森林恢复力下降伴随着EPE的下降，而GPP却在增加，这可能与大气水分需求增加和土壤水分限制有关。该研究结果有助于改进森林死亡模型，并提高基于光合作用的GPP评估。

However, albeit the deepening of the ASL since the 1950s has been attributed to anthropogenic forcing, the multi‐decadal variability of the ASL remains poorly understood, because of a lack of long observations. Here, we apply a newly developed data assimilation method to reconstruct the ASL over 1870–2000. We study the forced and internal variability of the ASL using our new reconstruction in concert with existing large ensembles of climate model simulations. Our findings robustly demonstrate that an atmospheric teleconnection originating from the tropical Indo‐Pacific is the main driver of ASL variability at the multi‐decadal time scale, with resemblance to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation.

Specifically, the discharge processes that produce LF‐MF magnetic radiations from bidirectional leaders are revealed by high‐speed images, and these LF‐MF radiations correspond to the VHF radiations generated by bidirectional leaders well. Unlike the strong correlation between LF‐MF radiation strengths and discharge intensities, the VHF radiation strengths exhibit significant variation even among similar‐intensity discharge events, as VHF radiations correspond to the random and microscopic discharge processes associated with streamers.

We present new summer measurements of circulation and mixing near a marine‐terminating glacier with active sub‐glacial discharge. 65% of the fjord's vertical overturning circulation is driven by the buoyant plume, however we newly report intense vertical and horizontal mixing in the plume's horizontal spreading phase, accounting for the remaining 35%. Buoyant plume theory supports 2%–5% of total glacial melt. Thus, most of the heat associated with vertical overturing short‐circuits the glacial front.

The internal and fast modulations are further verified by the analysis based on fast Fourier transform analyses. Moreover, the spatial distributions of the Fourier spectral amplitude show that the internal and fast modulations are well‐structured within auroral patches.

The FAC appears at the leading part of the ADF and its densities can reach about 200 nA/m2, which is significantly larger than those reported before. Such current is primarily contributed by the electron flow, which also forms electron beam distribution in the anti‐parallel direction. Significant energy conversion (E⋅ J, E is electric field and J is current density) is also observed at the ADF, which is mainly contributed by the FAC and the fluctuating electric fields.

We investigate the extent to which this generalizes in comprehensive GCMs. We find that in the Community Atmosphere Model, global‐mean precipitation increases approximately linearly with global‐mean surface temperatures up to about 330 K, where it peaks at 5 mm day−1. Beyond 330 K, global‐mean precipitation decreases substantially despite increasing surface temperatures because of increased atmospheric shortwave absorption by water vapor, which decreases the shortwave radiation available for evaporation at the surface. Precipitation decreases in the tropics and subtropics but continues to increase in the extratropics because of continuously strengthening poleward moisture transport. Precipitable water increases everywhere, resulting in longer water‐vapor residence times and implying more episodic precipitation. Other GCMs indicate global‐mean precipitation might exhibit a smaller maximum rate and begin to decrease at lower surface temperatures.",David B. Bonan;Tapio Schneider;Jiang Zhu,Geophysical Research Letters,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要研究了气候变化对全球降水的影响，使用了综合环流模型（GCM）进行模拟。研究发现，随着全球平均地表温度的升高，全球平均降水量在一定范围内会增加，但超过一定阈值后会开始下降。这与热带和亚热带地区降水减少，而温带地区降水增加有关。论文还探讨了大气中水汽对太阳辐射吸收的影响，以及水汽含量增加对降水模式的影响。总体而言，这篇论文关注的是气候变化对降水的影响，而不是大气环境遥感技术。
10.1029/2024GL110670,On the Relationship Between Condensed Water Content and Liquid‐Ice Mixing Homogeneity in Mixed‐Phase Stratiform Clouds,"As a key factor influencing the cloud life cycle and radiative properties, liquid‐ice mass partitioning remains a major source of uncertainties in modeling mixed‐phase clouds. One of the unresolved problems is that liquid‐ice mixing is highly inhomogeneous, but it has not been well understood and quantified for parameterization. In this study, the liquid‐ice mixing homogeneity (χ) is quantified using the information‐theoretic entropy based on airborne measurements. It is demonstrated that χ is positively correlated with the condensed water content (CWC). Cloud regions with low χ are consist of liquid and ice clusters. With the increase in χ, the size and frequency of continuous mixed‐phase clusters increase. For a given CWC, χ is lower at relatively warm temperatures as sedimentation of large ice crystals can enhance the inhomogeneity. The strong positive relationship between CWC and χ indicates CWC should be considered when parameterizing the liquid‐ice mixing in models.",Yuting Deng;Jing Yang;Yan Yin;Chunsong Lu;Baojun Chen;Xiaobo Dong;Zhien Wang;Bo Zhang;Xinghua Bao;Tuanjie Hou,Geophysical Research Letters,TRUE,"['cloud microphysics', 'satellite remote sensing', 'cloud radiative properties']",该研究关注混合相云中液态水和冰的混合均匀性，并探讨了其与云凝结水含量之间的关系。研究利用机载观测数据，通过信息熵方法量化了混合均匀性，并发现混合均匀性与云凝结水含量呈正相关关系。这对于理解云的演化过程、辐射特性以及卫星遥感观测的解释具有重要意义。
10.1029/2023GL108126,Deciphering the Role of Total Water Storage Anomalies in Mediating Regional Flooding,"Regional floods result from various flood generation mechanisms. Traditional analyses mainly link flooding to extreme rainfall, with limited input from soil moisture. Total water storage (TWS) is a holistic measure of basin wetness, including additional storage components from surface water, snow, and groundwater. Utilizing a new 5‐day Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and its Follow On (GRACE(‐FO)) data set, we investigated the linkage between short‐term TWS anomaly (TWSA) and regional flooding. The 5‐day TWSA solutions revealed flood signals missed by monthly TWSA solutions. Global basins exhibit distinct storage‐discharge co‐evolution patterns, offering new insights into flood mechanisms and propensity. Our bivariate event analyses show the annual maximum river discharges co‐occur more often with the TWSA maxima than with precipitation in many basins. Further analyses revealed TWSA's time‐lagged effect on river discharge, particularly in basins susceptible to floods triggered by saturation‐excess runoff. The 5‐day TWSA provides a new source of information for enhancing global flood preparedness.",Alexander Y. Sun;Himanshu Save;Ashraf Rateb;Peishi Jiang;Bridget R.

10.1029/2024JD040888,Near‐Surface Wind Convergence Along the Sea Ice Edge in the Greenland Sea: Its Mean State and Shaping Process,"At mid‐latitudes, a narrow band of near‐surface wind convergence (NSWC) overlies the western boundary currents in long‐term climatology as a response to steep sea surface temperature gradients. The underlying dynamics shaping mean convergence in the mid‐latitude region have been investigated in detail. In polar regions, surface temperature gradients are intense along the sea ice edges. However, literature concerning NSWC near sea ice edges is limited. This study investigates time‐mean NSWC along sea ice edges and its shaping processes, focusing on the Greenland Sea, based on atmospheric reanalysis. In cold‐season climatology, positive NSWC overlies the sea ice edge, resulting in a localized upward motion reaching the free atmosphere. The mean NSWC was insensitive to sea ice thickness and surface roughness in the regional model. This study suggests that, in addition to local atmospheric boundary processes, extreme NSWC events play a vital role in shaping the mean distribution. Although these features are similar to those along the Gulf Stream, atmospheric fronts appear to play a relatively minor role in the Greenland Sea. Instead, the frequent cyclone generation near the sea ice edge and the anticyclonic circulation over Greenland in conjunction with the transient synoptic circulation seem essential. In the warm season, positive NSWC was virtually missing in the Greenland Sea, unlike in the Gulf Stream region, reflecting the shallow virtual temperature response to the surface thermal forcing. This study contributes to understanding the mechanisms by which sea ice variability affects large‐scale atmospheric circulation in remote regions.",R.

10.1029/2023JD040514,Forecasting Daily Fire Radiative Energy Using Data Driven Methods and Machine Learning Techniques,"Increasing impacts of wildfires on Western US air quality highlights the need for forecasts of smoke emissions based on dynamic modeled wildfires. This work utilizes knowledge of weather, fuels, topography, and firefighting, combined with machine learning and other statistical methods, to generate 1‐ and 2‐day forecasts of fire radiative energy (FRE). The models are trained on data covering 2019 and 2021 and evaluated on data for 2020. For the 1‐day (2‐day) forecasts, the random forest model shows the most skill, explaining 48% (25%) of the variance in observed daily FRE when trained on all available predictors compared to the 2% (<0%) of variance explained by persistence for the extreme fire year of 2020. The random forest model also shows improved skill in forecasting day‐to‐day increases and decreases in FRE, with 28% (39%) of observed increase (decrease) days predicted, and increase (decrease) days are identified with 62% (60%) accuracy. Error in the random forest increases with FRE, and the random forest tends toward persistence under severe fire weather. Sensitivity analysis shows that near‐surface weather and the latest observed FRE contribute the most to the skill of the model. When the random forest model was trained on subsets of the training data produced by agencies (e.g., the Canadian or US Forest Services), comparable if not better performance was achieved (1‐day R2 = 0.39–0.48, 2‐day R2 = 0.13–0.34).

10.1029/2024JD041761,The North Pacific Meridional Mode and Its Impact on ENSO in the Second Version of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model,"The North Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM) is the strongest interannual air‐sea coupled system in the subtropical northeastern Pacific, which can significantly impact the development of El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study examines performance of the second version of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model (CAS‐ESM2), developed primarily at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP/CAS), in simulating the PMM, ENSO, and their relationship. It reveals that CAS‐ESM2 can well reproduce the tropical climate mean states, including sea surface temperature (SST), surface winds, and precipitation. Furthermore, the model shows a good ability in reproducing the seasonal evolutions of the PMM and ENSO. Moreover, CAS‐ESM2 effectively simulates the influence of the PMM on subsequent ENSO and the underlying physical mechanisms, including the wind‐evaporation‐SST feedback process, the trade wind charging mechanism and summer deep convection mechanism. However, some improvements are still needed, particularly in representing the periodicity of the PMM, an overestimation of the ENSO intensity and westward extension of ENSO‐related SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific.

The multi‐model mean shows that the June–July–August ITCZ variations generally dominate the annual changes. The Asian ITCZ shifts northward over western Asia and southward over the eastern side in both the LIG and MH, and the opposite occurs in the LGM. Its intensity varies with longitude similarly for the LIG and MH and generally weakens in the LGM.

10.1029/2024JD040788,Influences of Background Rotation on Secondary Eyewall Formation of Tropical Cyclones in Idealized f‐Plane Simulations,"This study investigates the background rotational influences on the secondary eyewall formation (SEF) in tropical cyclones (TCs) in quiescent f‐plane environments. For given initial structures, simulated vortices tend to experience earlier SEF at lower latitudes. Yet the size of the secondary eyewall does not change monotonically with the latitudes. Specifically, ∼20°N provides the optimal amount of background rotation for the largest secondary eyewall size without considering other environmental forcings. Different background rotation rates affect SEF mainly by modulating the outer‐core convection as well as the wind structures. Specifically, the lower rotation rate causes more outer‐core surface fluxes, thus facilitating the outer rainbands (ORBs) at larger radii. Yet the secondary eyewall does not necessarily form at larger radii at lower latitudes since the transition from the ORBs to secondary eyewall is localized in a region of boundary layer (BL) convergence preceded by accelerated tangential winds. Budget analysis reveals that the differences in the acceleration of outer‐core tangential winds among vortices at different latitudes are dominated by the radial flux of absolute vorticity. Due to the non‐uniform influences of background rotation on the BL inflow and absolute vorticity, the most efficient spin‐up of outer‐core tangential winds is achieved at a medium latitude of 20°N, which leads up to SEF at the largest radii. By comparison, for TCs at lower (higher) latitudes, the lower outer‐core absolute vorticity (radial inflow) limits the acceleration of outer‐core tangential winds, thus placing SEF at smaller radii.",Yi‐Fan Wang;Yuanlong Li,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要研究了热带气旋中次生眼墙形成的机制，重点关注了背景旋转对次生眼墙形成的影响。研究利用理想化的 f 平面上模拟了不同纬度下的热带气旋，发现背景旋转会影响外层对流和风场结构，从而影响次生眼墙的形成和大小。研究结果表明，在 20°N 左右的纬度，背景旋转能够促进外层对流，加速切向风，从而形成最大的次生眼墙。该研究主要关注的是热带气旋动力学方面的研究，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。
10.1029/2023JD040142,High‐Resolution Ice‐Core Analyses Identify the Eldgjá Eruption and a Cluster of Icelandic and Trans‐Continental Tephras Between 936 and 943 CE,"The Eldgjá eruption is the largest basalt lava flood of the Common Era. It has been linked to a major ice‐core sulfur (S) spike in 939–940 CE and Northern Hemisphere summer cooling in 940 CE. Despite its magnitude and potential climate impacts, uncertainties remain concerning the eruption timeline, atmospheric dispersal of emitted volatiles, and coincident volcanism in Iceland and elsewhere. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of Greenland ice‐cores from 936 to 943 CE, revealing a complex volatile record and cryptotephra with numerous geochemical populations. Transitional alkali basalt tephra matching Eldgjá are found in 939–940 CE, while tholeiitic basalt shards present in 936/937 CE and 940/941 CE are compatible with contemporaneous Icelandic eruptions from Grímsvötn and Bárðarbunga‐Veiðivötn systems (including V‐Sv tephra). We also find four silicic tephra populations, one of which we link to the Jala Pumice of Ceboruco (Mexico) at 941 ± 1 CE. Triple S isotopes, Δ33S, spanning 936–940 CE are indicative of upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric transport of aerosol sourced from the Icelandic fissure eruptions. However, anomalous Δ33S (down to −0.4‰) in 940–941 CE evidence stratospheric aerosol transport consistent with summer surface cooling revealed by tree‐ring reconstructions. Tephra associated with the anomalous Δ33S have a variety of compositions, complicating the attribution of climate cooling to Eldgjá alone.

10.1029/2024JD041190,Linking Future Precipitation Changes to Weather Features in CESM2‐LE,"Weather features, such as extratropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers (ARs), and fronts, contribute to substantial amounts of precipitation globally and are associated with different precipitation characteristics. However, future changes in these characteristics, as well as their representation in climate models, remain uncertain. We attribute 6‐hourly accumulated precipitation to cyclones, moisture transport axes (AR‐like features), fronts, and cold air outbreaks, and the combinations thereof in 10 ensemble members of the CESM2‐LE between 1960 and 2100 under the SSP3‐7.0 scenario. We find that, despite some biases in both precipitation and weather features, CESM2‐LE adeptly represents the precipitation characteristics associated with the different combinations of weather features. The combinations of weather features that contribute most to precipitation in the present climate also contribute the most to future changes, both due to changes in intensity as well as frequency. While the increase in precipitation intensity dominates the overall response for total precipitation in the storm track regions, the precipitation intensity for the individual weather features does not necessarily change significantly. Instead, approximately half of the increase in precipitation intensity in the storm track regions can be attributed to a higher occurrence of the more intensely precipitating combinations of weather features, such as the co‐occurrence of extratropical cyclones, fronts, and moisture transport axes.",Kjersti Konstali;Thomas Spengler;Clemens Spensberger;Asgeir Sorteberg,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要关注的是气候模型CESM2-LE对未来降水变化的模拟，特别是将降水与天气特征（如气旋、大气河流、锋面等）联系起来，分析了这些特征在降水变化中的贡献。论文没有涉及到大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。

A total of 1920 dust days were recorded with less than 10% being classified as dust storms. We calculated the wind speeds at 5%, 25% and 50% of the dust‐event frequency distribution. The mean wind speed for the threshold of 5% is 10.9 ± 1.6 ms−1 which is twice as large as the values in the Taklamakan, Western Sahel, and Sudan, and consistent with the perceptually infrequent dust activity despite the exceptional aridity. We see no overall long‐term trend but increased dust activity for 1970–1978, 1984–1988 and 2013–2017.

10.1029/2024JD041274,Physicochemical Characterization of Religious Burning Aerosols in Lhasa on the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau,"Religious burning (RB) has been identified as a major source of atmospheric aerosols on the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau. However, there is limited understanding of the detailed chemical composition, size distribution, and optical properties of RB aerosols in this region. To characterize these important aerosol properties, ambient PM2.5 and size resolved aerosols from RB emissions in Lhasa were collected during summer 2019. Organic functional group (OFG) and inorganic ion composition was measured using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ion chromatography, respectively. The ambient PM2.5 was dominated by organic components, with the OFG concentrations significantly higher during religious events, reflecting the substantial impact of RB emissions on local air quality. The RB aerosols were characterized by high fractions of alkane (34%), hydroxyl (29%), and carboxylic acid (13%) groups, with peak mass in the accumulation mode (0.56–1.00 μm). The high abundance of hydroxyl group and the size distribution pattern suggested that the RB aerosols were formed from volatilization of fuel materials followed by unaltered condensation, a process that may be unique to the low‐temperature, low‐oxygen burning in the scattered burners at the temples. The absorption coefficient of RB aerosols showed similar size distribution to the mass size distribution, but the absorption Ångström exponent displayed the lowest value in the 0.56–1.00 μm size mode. This specific size distribution aligned with the mass fraction of carboxylic acids and mirrored the mass proportion of alkanes, suggesting that smaller and larger particles were enriched with substances that have higher light‐absorbing capabilities.",Kaihui Xia;Cheng‐Cheng Liu;Sheng‐Shi Mei;Zhixuan Bai;Jianchun Bian;Pengfei Yu;Chun Zhao;Shang Liu,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,TRUE,"['aerosol', 'air quality', 'chemical composition', 'size distribution', 'optical properties', 'remote sensing', 'satellite', 'ground-based observation']",该研究主要关注青藏高原拉萨宗教焚烧产生的气溶胶对当地空气质量的影响。研究通过对宗教焚烧排放的气溶胶进行化学成分、粒径分布和光学性质的分析，揭示了宗教焚烧对当地空气质量的显著影响。研究结果表明，宗教焚烧排放的气溶胶以有机成分为主，其中烷烃、羟基和羧酸含量较高，并呈现出独特的粒径分布特征。研究还分析了气溶胶的光学性质，为理解宗教焚烧对大气环境的影响提供了重要信息。
10.1029/2024JD040822,Synoptic and Mesoscale Dynamics of Cold Surges Over the South China Sea and Their Control on Extreme Rainfall,"We investigate the synoptic and mesoscale dynamics of two wet and two dry cold surges in January 2021 using a combination of observations, reanalysis, and convective‐scale model forecasts from the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM). We focus on the wet surges, and particularly the wettest days which are locally extreme over Singapore and the surrounding region (i.e., the daily mean and area‐averaged rainfall over 20 years exceeds the 99th percentile). On the large scale, the wet surges are characterized by an anomalously strong anticyclone over Siberia prior to their onset. The anticyclone and resultant surge winds are stronger than those of the dry surges. There is also a relatively moist (dry) environment prior to the onset of the wet (dry) surges, with the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) being in Phase 3 (Phase 6). On the mesoscale, the combination of the cold surge and a local tropical low produce strong, moist north‐easterly winds and convection over the Singapore region. The equatorward advection of positive anomalies of equivalent potential temperature resembles a weak gravity‐current‐like structure at its head, although the spatial scale is much too large for a gravity current. There is a moist bias in the model forecasts, although the precipitation is underestimated regionally during the wet surges and particularly on the extreme rainfall days.

10.1029/2024JD041422,Comparing the Upper Mesospheric Temperature Trend and the Response to Solar Activity Derived From the Daily Mean and Nocturnal Na Lidar Observations,"Over the past decades, various experimental and numerical model studies have indicated cooling trend in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), while the magnitude of the trend varies noticeably. Previous studies using the lidar observations derived the temperature trends and solar responses solely from the traditional nocturnal measurements. While these archived results are more or less in agreement with modeling studies, one of the main uncertainties in these studies is the potential biases induced by the trends of the diurnal tide forced in the lower atmosphere, and that of the in situ exothermal reactions involving the photolysis. In the MLT, the diurnal tide has significant seasonal variations, considerable amplitude and is one of the dominant dynamic sources. However, its potential effects in the trend studies have rarely been discussed. In this paper, we present and compare the long‐term temperature trends in the upper mesosphere utilizing the daily mean and nightly mean temperature profiles measured by a Sodium (Na) Doppler lidar at midlatitude. The system was operating routinely in full diurnal cycles between 2002 and 2017, obtaining a unique multi‐year temperature data set. A customized multi‐linear regression (MLR) model is applied to determine the linear trends and the other fitting parameters, such as ENSO and solar F10.7 responses in the upper mesosphere. This study indicates the daily mean cooling trend between 84 and 98 km is larger than that of nightly mean trend by ∼−1 K/decade, while differences in the solar response are within the fitting uncertainties.",Tao Yuan;Melania Pena;Chih‐Ting Hsu;Liying Qian,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,TRUE,"['atmospheric temperature', 'lidar', 'sodium lidar', 'mesosphere', 'thermosphere', 'solar activity', 'diurnal tide']",这篇论文研究了利用钠原子多普勒激光雷达观测数据，分析了中层顶和热层底部温度趋势和太阳活动响应。研究发现，利用全天平均温度数据得到的冷却趋势比仅利用夜间平均温度数据得到的冷却趋势更大，而太阳活动响应的差异在拟合误差范围内。该研究表明，利用全天平均温度数据可以更准确地分析中层顶和热层底部温度趋势。
10.1029/2024JD040730,Elaborating the Atmospheric Transformation of Combined and Free Amino Acids From the Perspective of Observational Studies,"Proteinaceous matter (PrM) is a substantial component of bioaerosols. Although numerous studies have examined the characteristics and sources of PrM in the atmosphere, its interactions with atmospheric oxidants remain uncertain. A 1‐year observation of PrM characteristics in PM2.5 was performed in both urban Nanchang (eastern China) and suburban Guiyang (southwestern China), respectively. Glycine was the dominant free amino acid (FAA) species in urban Nanchang. In contrast, proline dominated both total free amino acids (FAAs) and total combined amino acids (CAAs) in suburban Guiyang. We found that oxidative degradation can significantly promote the release of FAAs, especially glycine, from CAAs in Nanchang. The controlled experiment on protein oxidation by hydroxyl radical suggested that the contribution of free glycine to the total FAA fraction tended to increase during the oxidative degradation of CAAs, supporting the predominance of glycine in FAAs in Nanchang and most previous observations. The composition of FAAs was mainly influenced by primary sources in suburban Guiyang with weak atmospheric degradation of PrM. These results suggest that the degradation of aerosol PrM by atmospheric oxidants can be responsible for the difference in FAA composition between the biosphere and the atmosphere, and also imply that the oxidative degradation of aerosol PrM may be a potential source of secondary organic nitrogen compounds in aerosols. Thus, this study can improve the current understanding of the composition characteristics of PrM in the biosphere and the atmosphere, as well as the liquid phase reactions of proteinaceous compounds with atmospheric oxidants.",Yu Xu;Xi Lin;Qi‐Bin Sun;Hong‐Wei Xiao;Hao Xiao;Hua‐Yun Xiao,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,TRUE,"['atmospheric composition', 'aerosol', 'amino acids', 'air quality', 'satellite observation', 'bioaerosols']",该研究主要关注大气中蛋白质物质（PrM）的转化，特别是自由氨基酸（FAA）和结合氨基酸（CAA）的转化。研究通过一年时间对南昌和贵阳两个城市PM2.5中的PrM进行观测，发现大气氧化剂可以促进CAA降解并释放FAA，特别是甘氨酸。研究还通过羟基自由基氧化蛋白质的控制实验验证了这一结论。研究结果表明，大气氧化剂对PrM的降解可能是导致生物圈和大气中FAA组成差异的原因，并暗示PrM的氧化降解可能是气溶胶中二次有机氮化合物的潜在来源。这项研究对理解大气中PrM的组成特征以及蛋白质化合物与大气氧化剂的液相反应具有重要意义。
10.1029/2024JD041135,"Accounting for Black Carbon Mixing State, Nonsphericity, and Heterogeneity Effects in Its Optical Property Parameterization in a Climate Model","Modeling atmospheric black carbon (BC) aerosol optical properties remains largely uncertain due to their complex mixing states, nonsphericity, and heterogeneity of coating distribution. Although there exist numerical models with realistic BC morphologies, these models are mostly limited to particle‐scale studies and have not been coupled to large‐scale atmospheric or climate models. In this study, a multidimensional parameterization scheme is developed by an accurate numerical algorithm for BC optical property calculation in global climate models, by incorporating their mixing state and nonspherical structure as well as heterogeneous coating distribution. The scheme was coupled and tested with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) by a weighted averaging algorithm for individual particles and integration for particle ensembles. The simulation results indicate that BC morphology has a limited influence on the aerosol absorption cross section (Cabs), and the differences in Cabs between irregularly coated fractal aggregates and ideal core‐shell spherical (CS) counterparts are ∼3% on average. However, the relative positions between the BC core and coating parts may introduce Cabs variations of up to 69% as compared with the CS results. The BC mixing state introduce ∼20% relative variations in the global average aerosol absorption optical depth, which is comparable to that of heterogeneity of coating distribution and three times greater than that of particle nonsphericity.

10.1029/2023JD039890,Retreat of the Bay of Bengal Summer Monsoon,"The Bay of Bengal summer monsoon (BOBSM) is the most prominent branch of the Asian summer monsoon system, which exhibits complex interannual variability. While previous studies have focused on the onset conditions of the BOBSM, less attention has been paid to the retreat of the BOBSM. In this study, we propose an index to measure BOBSM retreat, based on the mean zonal wind field at 850 hPa during the summer‐to‐winter monsoon transitions. By analyzing the climatic characteristics and interannual variability of the BOBSM retreat using this index, we find that BOBSM retreat exhibits significant interannual variability, which is closely related to the occurrence of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events. Statistically, when a positive IOD event takes place in the boreal autumn season, the retreat of the summer monsoon occurs earlier correspondingly. Conversely, the retreat is delayed when a negative IOD event occurs.",Qiuchi Li;Lin Liu;Yongliang Duan;Guang Yang;Yang Yang;Yulan Luo;Ai Zeng,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要研究孟加拉湾夏季风季风的撤退，并分析了印度洋偶极子事件对其的影响。论文中没有提及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。
10.1029/2024JD041377,Where Dust Comes From: Global Assessment of Dust Source Attributions With AeroCom Models,"The source of dust in the global atmosphere is an important factor to better understand the role of dust aerosols in the climate system. However, it is a difficult task to attribute the airborne dust over the remote land and ocean regions to their origins since dust from various sources are mixed during long‐range transport. Recently, a multi‐model experiment, namely the AeroCom‐III Dust Source Attribution (DUSA), has been conducted to estimate the relative contribution of dust in various locations from different sources with tagged simulations from seven participating global models. The BASE run and a series of runs with nine tagged regions were made to estimate the contribution of dust emitted in East‐ and West‐Africa, Middle East, Central‐ and East‐Asia, North America, the Southern Hemisphere, and the prominent dust hot spots of the Bodélé and Taklimakan Deserts. The models generally agree in large scale mean dust distributions, however models show large diversity in dust source attribution. The inter‐model differences are significant with the global model dust diversity in 30%–50%, but the differences in regional and seasonal scales are even larger. The multi‐model analysis estimates that North Africa contributes 60% of global atmospheric dust loading, followed by Middle East and Central Asia sources (24%). Southern hemispheric sources account for 10% of global dust loading, however it contributes more than 70% of dust over the Southern Hemisphere. The study provides quantitative estimates of the impact of dust emitted from different source regions on the globe and various receptor regions including remote land, ocean, and the polar regions synthesized from the seven models.",Dongchul Kim;Mian Chin;Greg Schuster;Hongbin Yu;Toshihiko Takemura;Paolo Tuccella;Paul Ginoux;Xiaohong Liu;Yang Shi;Hitoshi Matsui;Kostas Tsigaridis;Susanne E.

10.1029/2024JD040973,Leveraging RALI‐THINICE Observations to Assess How the ICOLMDZ Model Simulates Clouds Embedded in Arctic Cyclones,"Despite their essential role in the high‐latitude climate, the representation of mixed‐phase clouds is still a challenge for Global Climate Models (GCMs)'s cloud schemes. In this study we propose a methodology for robustly assessing Arctic mixed‐phase cloud properties in a climate model using airborne measurements. We leverage data collected during the RALI‐THINICE airborne campaign that took place near Svalbard in August 2022 to evaluate the simulation of mid‐level clouds associated with Arctic cyclones. Simulations are carried out with the new limited‐area configuration of the ICOLMDZ model which combines the recent icosahedral dynamical core DYNAMICO and the physics of LMDZ, the atmospheric component of the IPSL‐CM Earth System Model. Airborne radar and microphysical probes measurements are then used to evaluate the simulated clouds. A comparison method has been set‐up to guarantee as much as possible the spatiotemporal co‐location between observed and simulated cloud fields. We mostly focus on the representation of ice and liquid in‐cloud contents and on their vertical distribution. Results show that the model overestimates the amount of cloud condensates and exhibits a poor cloud phase spatial distribution, with too much liquid water far from cloud top and too much ice close to it. The downward gradual increase in snowfall flux is also not captured by the model. This in‐depth model evaluation thereby pinpoints priorities for further improvements in the ICOLMDZ cloud scheme.",Lea Raillard;Étienne Vignon;Gwendal Rivière;Jean‐Baptiste Madeleine;Yann Meurdesoif;Julien Delanoë;Arnaud Caubel;Olivier Jourdan;Antoine Baudoux;Sébastien Fromang;Philippe Conesa,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,TRUE,"['cloud properties', 'airborne measurements', 'radar', 'microphysical probes', 'Arctic cyclones', 'climate model evaluation']",该研究利用2022年8月在斯瓦尔巴群岛附近进行的RALI-THINICE机载观测数据，评估了ICOLMDZ模型对北极气旋中嵌入云层的模拟能力。研究重点关注了模型对云中冰水含量及其垂直分布的模拟，并利用机载雷达和微物理探测数据进行评估。研究结果表明，该模型高估了云凝结物的含量，并且在云顶附近存在过多的冰，而远离云顶的地方则存在过多的液态水。该研究结果为ICOLMDZ云方案的进一步改进提供了方向。
10.1029/2024JD041052,"Improving HONO Simulations and Evaluating Its Impacts on Secondary Pollution in the Yangtze River Delta Region, China","Secondary air pollution, especially ozone (O3) and secondary aerosols, are emerging air quality challenges confronting China. Nitrous acid (HONO), as the predominant source of hydroxyl radicals (OH), are acknowledged to be essential for secondary pollution. However, HONO concentrations are usually underestimated by current air quality models due to the inadequate representations of its sources. In the present study, we revised the Weather Research and Forecasting & Chemistry (WRF‐Chem) model by incorporating additional HONO sources, including primary emissions, photo‐/dark oxidation of NOx, heterogeneous uptake of NO2 on surfaces, and nitrate photolysis. By combining in‐situ measurements in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, we found the improved model show much better performance on HONO simulation and is capable of reproducing observed high concentrations. The source‐oriented method is employed to quantitatively understand the relative importance of various processes, which showed that heterogeneous NO2 uptake on the ground surface was the major contributor to HONO formation in urban areas. Comparatively, photo‐oxidation of NOx is a main contributor in rural areas. The introduction of multiple sources of HONO led to an apparent increase in OH and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The promoted HO2 levels further increased diurnal O3 concentration by 4.5–12.9 ppb, while secondary inorganic and organic concentrations were also increased by 14%–32% during a typical secondary pollution event. The improved description of HONO emission and formation in the model substantially narrowed the gaps between simulations and observations, highlighting the great importance in understanding and numerical representations of HONO in secondary pollution study.",Haoran Zhang;Chuanhua Ren;Xueyu Zhou;Keqin Tang;Yuliang Liu;Tengyu Liu;Jiaping Wang;Xuguang Chi;Mengmeng Li;Nan Li;Xin Huang;Aijun Ding,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,TRUE,"['air quality monitoring', 'ozone', 'secondary aerosols', 'HONO', 'WRF-Chem model', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",该研究主要关注中国长江三角洲地区的二次污染问题，特别是臭氧和二次气溶胶。研究者通过改进WRF-Chem模型，加入了更多HONO的来源，例如初级排放、NOx的光/暗氧化、NO2在表面的异相吸收和硝酸盐的光解。通过与实地测量数据的对比，研究发现改进后的模型能够更好地模拟HONO浓度，并能够再现观测到的高浓度。研究还利用源解析方法定量分析了不同过程对HONO形成的贡献，发现地面异相NO2吸收是城市地区HONO形成的主要贡献者，而NOx的光氧化是农村地区的主要贡献者。HONO来源的增加导致OH和HO2自由基浓度明显增加，进而导致臭氧浓度增加，并影响了二次无机和有机物的浓度。该研究强调了在二次污染研究中理解和数值模拟HONO的重要性。
10.1029/2023JD040329,Impacts of Synoptic‐Scale Dynamics on Clouds and Radiation in High Southern Latitudes,"High‐latitudinal mixed‐phase clouds significantly affect Earth's radiative balance. Observations of cloud and radiative properties from two field campaigns in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica were compared with two global climate model simulations. A cyclone compositing method was used to quantify “dynamics‐cloud‐radiation” relationships relative to the extratropical cyclone centers. Observations show larger asymmetry in cloud and radiative properties between western and eastern sectors at McMurdo compared with Macquarie Island. Most observed quantities at McMurdo are higher in the western (i.e., post‐frontal) than the eastern (frontal) sector, including cloud fraction, liquid water path (LWP), net surface shortwave and longwave radiation (SW and LW), except for ice water path (IWP) being higher in the eastern sector. The two models were found to overestimate cloud fraction and LWP at Macquarie Island but underestimate them at McMurdo Station. IWP is consistently underestimated at both locations, both sectors, and in all seasons. Biases of cloud fraction, LWP, and IWP are negatively correlated with SW biases and positively correlated with LW biases. The persistent negative IWP biases may have become one of the leading causes of radiative biases over the high southern latitudes, after correcting the underestimation of supercooled liquid water in the older model versions.

10.1029/2024JD040866,Influences of Stratospheric Arctic Vortex on Surface Air Temperature Over Asia,"The influence of northern polar vortex in the stratosphere (SPV) in December‐January on Asia's surface air temperature (SAT) in February has been examined using reanalysis data sets and a barotropic model. An out‐of‐phase interannual linkage between the SPV in December‐January and SAT in February during 1979–2022 has been observed, that is, a strong (weak) SPV corresponds to a cooling (warming) over Asia. Approximately 25% of the SAT over Asia in February can be explained by the SPV in December‐January. This relationship between the SPV and SAT is independent of the Arctic Oscillation. The influence of the SPV on SAT over Asia cannot be solely explained by radiative processes, but is instead related to circulation anomalies in the troposphere. A stronger SPV tends to result in negative geopotential height anomalies with cyclonic circulation over Asia. The SPV‐related geopotential height over Asia is accompanied by a weakened teleconnection pattern between the North Atlantic and Asia, with three centers from the northeastern Atlantic‐eastern Europe‐Asia, and fewer stationary waves propagated from North Atlantic into Asia. These anomalous circulation patterns and anomalous northerly wind over Central Asia in February are beneficial to the colder air transportation from the higher latitudes to Asia, facilitating a surface cooling over Asia. Our results shed light on the interannual linkage between SPV and SAT over Asia, suggesting that the SPV in December‐January could be considered as a new predicator of SAT in February over Asia.",Dingzhu Hu;Junjie Yang;Huimin Zhang;Rongzhong Mo;Zhaoyong Guan,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,FALSE,"['stratospheric Arctic vortex', 'surface air temperature', 'reanalysis data', 'barotropic model', 'geopotential height', 'teleconnection pattern']",该研究主要关注北极平流层极涡对亚洲地表气温的影响，利用再分析数据和正压模式进行分析。研究发现，12月至1月北极平流层极涡强度与2月亚洲地表气温之间存在反相关系，即强极涡对应亚洲降温，弱极涡对应亚洲升温。研究还发现，这种关系与北极涛动无关，并与对流层环流异常有关。研究结果表明，12月至1月的北极平流层极涡可以作为2月亚洲地表气温预测的新的预测因子。该研究主要关注大气环流和气温变化，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。
10.1029/2024JD040755,"Photolytic Degradation of Water‐Soluble Organic Carbon in Snowmelts: Changes in Molecular Characteristics, Brown Carbon Chromophores, and Radiative Effects","Water‐soluble organic carbon (WSOC) deposited in ambient snowpack play key roles in regional carbon cycle and surface energy budget, but the impacts of photo‐induced processes on its optical and chemical properties are poorly understood yet. In this study, melted samples of the seasonal snow collected from northern Xinjiang, northwestern China, were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation to investigate the photolytic transformations of WSOC. Molecular characteristics and chemical composition of WSOC and its brown carbon (BrC) constituents were investigated using high‐performance liquid chromatography interfaced with a photodiode array detector and a high‐resolution mass spectrometer. Upon illumination, formation of nitrogen‐ and sulfur‐containing species with high molecular weight was observed in snow samples influenced by soil‐ and plant‐derived organics. In contrast, the representative sample collected from remote region showed the lowest molecular diversity and photolytic reactivity among all samples, in which no identified BrC chromophores decomposed upon illumination. Approximately 65% of chromophores in urban samples endured UV irradiation. However, most of BrC composed of phenolic/lignin‐derived compounds and flavonoids disappeared in the illuminated samples containing WSOC from soil‐ and plant‐related sources. Effects of the photochemical degradation of WSOC on the potential modulation of snow albedo were estimated. Apparent half‐lives of WSOC estimated as albedo reduction in 300–400 nm indicated 0.1–0.4 atmospheric equivalent days, which are shorter than typical photolysis half‐lives of ambient biomass smoke aerosol.

10.1029/2024JD040906,A Comparison of Regression Methods for Inferring Near‐Surface NO2 With Satellite Data,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an atmospheric pollutant emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources. Human exposure to high NO2 concentrations causes cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. The Environmental Protection Agency operates ground monitors across the U.S. which take hourly measurements of NO2 concentrations, providing precise measurements for assessing human pollution exposure but with sparse spatial distribution. Satellite‐based instruments capture NO2 amounts through the atmospheric column with global coverage at regular spatial resolution, but do not directly measure surface NO2. This study compares regression methods using satellite NO2 data from the TROPospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to estimate annual surface NO2 concentrations in varying geographic and land use settings across the continental U.S. We then apply the best‐performing regression models to estimate surface NO2 at 0.01° by 0.01° resolution, and we term this estimate as quasi‐NO2 (qNO2). qNO2 agrees best with measurements at suburban sites (cross‐validation (CV) R2 = 0.72) and away from major roads (CV R2 = 0.75). Among U.S. regions, qNO2 agrees best with measurements in the Midwest (CV R2 = 0.89) and agrees least in the Southwest (CV R2 = 0.65). To account for the non‐Gaussian distribution of TROPOMI NO2, we apply data transforms, with the Anscombe transform yielding highest agreement across the continental U.S. (CV R2 = 0.77).

10.1029/2024JD040756,Evolution of Light Absorption Enhancement of Black Carbon Aerosols From Biomass Burning in Atmospheric Photochemical Aging,"The light absorption enhancement (Eabs) of black carbon (BC) coated with non‐BC materials is crucial in the assessment of radiative forcing, yet its evolution during photochemical aging of plumes from biomass burning, the globe's largest source of BC, remains poorly understood. In this study, plumes from open burning of corn straw were introduced into a smog chamber to explore the evolution of Eabs during photochemical aging. The light absorption of BC was measured with and without coating materials by using a thermodenuder, while the size distributions of aerosols and composition of BC coating materials were also monitored. Eabs was found to increase initially, and then decrease with an overall downward trend. The lensing effect dominated in Eabs at 520 nm, with an estimated contribution percentages of 47.5%–94.5%, which is far greater than light absorption of coated brown carbon (BrC). The effects of thickening and chemical composition changes of the coating materials on Eabs were evaluated through comparing measured Eabs with that calculated by the Mie theory. After OH exposure of 1 × 1010 molecules cm−3 s, the thickening of coating materials led to an Eabs increase by 3.2% ± 1.6%, while the chemical composition changes or photobleaching induced an Eabs decrease by 4.7% ± 0.6%. Simple forcing estimates indicate that coated BC aerosols exhibit warming effects that were reduced after aging.

10.1029/2024JD040975,Ground‐Observed Snow Albedo Changes During Rain‐On‐Snow Events in Northern Alaska,"Rain‐on‐snow (ROS) events occur when rain falls on snowpack and can have substantial ecological and social impacts. During ROS events, liquid water in the snowpack can decrease the surface albedo, which contributes to the positive snow‐albedo feedback and further accelerates snowmelt. In a warming climate, the frequency and spatial coverage of ROS events are projected to increase in the high‐latitude regions, especially in northern Alaska. Multi‐year ground observations at two northern Alaska sites are utilized to evaluate 59 ROS events from 2012 to 2022. Results show that ROS events lead to dramatic snow albedo changes with a mean decline of −0.04 per day, which is considerably larger than the multi‐year mean of −0.005 in May and −0.008 in June. A snow albedo model is used to simulate the daily snow albedo changes due to snowpack liquid water content. The simulated impact of liquid water content accounts for only 10% of the observed snow albedo changes. In addition, composite synoptic conditions from reanalysis products reveal different moisture sources for ROS events. ROS events in May are associated with anomalous high pressure systems over the site and meridional transport of warm and moist air from lower latitudes. While the June synoptic conditions for ROS events show little deviation from the climatological mean and suggest local moisture contributions. ROS events in June show comparable snow albedo changes as in May despite the difference in moisture sources, which implies a prolonged impact of ROS events on rapid snow deterioration during late spring.",Yan Xie;Claire Pettersen;Mark Flanner;Julia Shates,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,FALSE,"['snow albedo', 'rain-on-snow', 'snowmelt', 'ground observations']",该研究主要关注的是北极地区降雨雪事件对雪反照率的影响，利用地面观测数据分析了降雨雪事件导致的雪反照率变化，并探讨了其对雪融化的影响。研究中没有涉及到大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。

10.1029/2023EF004393,Key Uncertainties and Modeling Needs for Managing Living Marine Resources in the Future Arctic Ocean,"Emerging fishing activity due to melting ice and poleward species distribution shifts in the rapidly‐warming Arctic Ocean challenges transboundary management and requires proactive governance. A 2021 moratorium on commercial fishing in the Arctic high seas provides a 16‐year runway for improved scientific understanding. Given substantial knowledge gaps, characterizing areas of highest uncertainty is a key first step. Marine ecosystem model ensembles that project future fish distributions could inform management of future Arctic fisheries, but Arctic‐specific variation has not yet been examined for global ensembles. We use the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Intercomparison Project ensemble driven by two Earth System Models (ESMs) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1‐2.6 and SSP5‐8.5) to illustrate the current state of and uncertainty among biomass projections for the Arctic Ocean over the duration of the moratorium. The models generally project biomass increases in more northern Arctic ecosystems and decreases in southern ecosystems, but wide intra‐model variation exceeds projection means in most cases. The two ESMs show opposite trends for the main environmental drivers. Therefore, these projections are currently insufficient to inform policy actions. Investment in sustained monitoring and improving modeling capacity, especially for sea ice dynamics, is urgently needed. Concurrently, it will be necessary to develop frameworks for making precautionary decisions under continued uncertainty. We conclude that researchers should be transparent about uncertainty, presenting these model projections not as a source of scientific “answers,” but as bounding for plausible, policy‐relevant questions to assess trade‐offs and mitigate risks.",Julia G.

10.1029/2023EF004236,"Tropical Cyclone Storm Surge‐Based Flood Risk Assessment Under Combined Scenarios of High Tides and Sea‐Level Rise: A Case Study of Hainan Island, China","In the context of climate change, coastal flood risk is intensifying globally, particularly in China, where intricate coastlines and frequent tropical cyclones make storm surges a major concern. Despite local government's efforts to initiate coastal monitoring networks and qualitative risk guidelines, there remains a gap in detailed and efficient quantitative assessments for combinations of multiple sea‐level components. To address this, we develop the Tropical Cyclone Storm Surge‐based Flood Risk Assessment under Combined Scenarios (TCSoS‐FRACS). This framework integrates impacts of storm surges, high tides, and sea‐level rise using a hybrid of statistical and dynamic models to balance reliability and efficiency. By combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, it incorporates economic and demographic factors for a deeper understanding of risk composition. Applying TCSoS‐FRACS to Hainan Island reveals that the combined effects of storm surges, high tides, and sea‐level rise significantly amplify local coastal flood risk, increasing economic losses to 4.27–5.90 times and affected populations to 4.96–6.23 times. Additionally, transitioning from Fossil‐fueled Development (SSP5‐8.5) to Sustainability (SSP1‐1.9) can reduce the risk increase by approximately half. The equivalence in flood hazard between current high tides and future sea level under a sustainable scenario boosts confidence in climate change adaptation efforts. However, coastal cities with low hazard but high exposure need heightened vigilance in flood defense, as future risk could escalate sharply. Our study provides new insights into coastal flood risk on Hainan Island and other regions with similar profiles, offering a transferable and efficient tool for disaster risk management and aiding in regional sustainable development.",Ziying Zhou;Saini Yang;Fuyu Hu;Bingrui Chen;Xianwu Shi;Xiaoyan Liu,Earth's Future,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注的是海岛地区的热带气旋风暴潮风险评估，利用统计和动态模型结合风暴潮、高潮位和海平面上升的影响，评估了海南岛的洪水风险。研究中没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。
10.1029/2024EF004479,Impacts of Sea‐Level Rise on Coastal Groundwater Table Simulated by an Earth System Model With a Land‐Ocean Coupling Scheme,"Sea‐level rise (SLR) poses a severe threat to the coastal environment through seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers. The rising groundwater table also exacerbates the risk of pluvial, fluvial, and groundwater flooding in coastal regions. However, current Earth system models (ESMs) commonly ignore the exchanges of water at the land‐ocean interface. To address this gap, we developed a novel land‐ocean hydrologic coupling scheme in a state‐of‐the‐science ESM, the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2). The new scheme includes the lateral exchange between seawater and groundwater and the vertical infiltration of seawater driven by the SLR‐induced inundation. Simulations were performed with the updated E3SMv2 for the global land‐ocean interface to assess the impacts of SLR on coastal groundwater under a high CO2 emission scenario. By the middle of this century, seawater infiltration on the inundated areas will be the dominant component in the land‐ocean coupling process, while the lateral subsurface flow exchange will be much smaller. The SLR‐induced seawater infiltration will raise the groundwater levels, enhance evapotranspiration, and increase runoff with distinct spatial patterns globally in the future. Although the coupling process is induced by SLR, we found topography and warming temperature have more control on the coupling impacts, probably due to the relatively modest magnitude of SLR during the selected future period. Overall, our study suggests significant groundwater and seawater exchange at the land‐ocean interface, which needs to be considered in ESMs.",Donghui Xu;Gautam Bisht;Dongyu Feng;Zeli Tan;Lingcheng Li;Han Qiu;L.

10.1029/2024EF004531,Future Climate Projections for South Florida: Improving the Accuracy of Air Temperature and Precipitation Extremes With a Hybrid Statistical Bias Correction Technique,"Projecting future climate variables is essential for comprehending the potential impacts on hydroclimatic hazards like floods and droughts. Evaluating these impacts is challenging due to the coarse spatial resolution of global climate models (GCMs); therefore, bias correction is widely used. Here, we applied two statistical methods—standard empirical quantile mapping (EQM) and a hybrid approach, EQM with linear correction (EQM‐LIN)—to bias correct precipitation and air temperature simulated by nine GCMs. We used historical observations from 20 weather stations across South Florida to project future climate under three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Compared to the EQM, the hybrid EQM‐LIN method improved R2 of daily quantiles by up to 30% over the historical period and improved MAE up to 70% in months that contain most extreme values. Projected extreme precipitation at the weather stations showed that, compared to the EQM‐LIN, the EQM method underestimates the high quantiles by up to 26% in SSP585. The projected changes in annual maximum precipitation from historical period (1985–2014) to near future (2040–2069) and far future (2070–2100) were between 2% and 16% across the study area. Projected future precipitation suggested a slight decrease during summer but an increase in fall.

10.1029/2023EF004242,The Key Role of Temporal Stratification for GCM Bias Correction in Climate Impact Assessments,"Characterizing climate change impacts on water resources typically relies on Global Climate Model (GCM) outputs that are bias‐corrected using observational data sets. In this process, two pivotal decisions are (a) the Bias Correction Method (BCM) and (b) how to handle the historically observed time series, which can be used as a continuous whole (i.e., without dividing it into sub‐periods), or partitioned into monthly, seasonal (e.g., 3 months), or any other temporal stratification (TS). Here, we examine how the interplay between the choice of BCM, TS, and the raw GCM seasonality may affect historical portrayals and projected changes. To this end, we use outputs from 29 GCMs belonging to the CMIP6 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5–8.5 scenario, using seven BCMs and three TSs (entire period, seasonal, and monthly). The results show that the effectiveness of BCMs in removing biases can vary depending on the TS and climate indices analyzed. Further, the choice of BCM and TS may yield different projected change signals and seasonality (especially for precipitation), even for climate models with low bias and a reasonable representation of precipitation seasonality during a reference period. Because some BCMs may be computationally expensive, we recommend using the linear scaling method as a diagnostics tool to assess how the choice of TS may affect the projected precipitation seasonality of a specific GCM. More generally, the results presented here unveil trade‐offs in how BCMs are applied, regardless of the climate regime, urging the hydroclimate community to carefully implement these techniques.",Nicolás A.

10.1029/2023EF004027,Joint Occurrence of Extreme Water Level and River Flows in St. Lawrence River Coasts Under Present and Sea Level Rise Conditions,"In low‐lying coastal regions, the joint occurrence of high river flow and high water levels can cause coastal flooding with substantial economic and social implications. Recent studies over Canada's coasts have shown that neglecting the interdependency between flood drivers can underestimate the risk of flooding by up to 50%. However, to date, such interdependency has not been investigated for the coasts of the St. Lawrence River, Estuary and Gulf system (StL), where Sea Level Rise (SLR), along with intensified river peaks, are already threatening these communities. In this study, a copula‐based bivariate frequency analysis was applied to quantify the likelihood of occurrence of flooding events under dependent and independent assumptions, for 26 sites along the StL. Furthermore, to quantify the impact of anthropogenic climate change, the joint return period in historical period was compared with that of projected SLR associated with RCP 8.5 for the year 2100. Results show that (a) the independence assumption can underestimate the likelihood of occurrence of flooding event in the Fluvial Section of the StL by up to 30 times and (b) the SLR can increase the likelihood of occurrence of flooding event by up to 50 times in the Estuary and the Gulf and by up to 5 times in the Fluvial Section of the StL.

The authors employ historical and high‐emission scenario simulations through a state‐of‐the‐art Earth system model to detect abrupt and persistent changes in the viability of marine habitats by leveraging an ecophysiological framework that quantifies how temperature and oxygen jointly limit the distribution of life in the ocean for a number of ecophysiotypes. A changepoint analysis is used to objectively detect shifts in decadal to multi‐decadal mean states in potential marine habitats. They observe a decrease in the ocean volume capable of providing viable habitats for those ecophysiotypes with positive sensitivity to hypoxia. About half of these decreases occur abruptly, thus highlighting potential risks on the capacity of marine organisms to cope with a changing environment.",Yeray Santana‐Falcón,Earth's Future,FALSE,[],本文主要关注海洋酸化和缺氧对海洋生态系统的影响，并利用地球系统模型模拟了不同排放情景下海洋栖息地的变化。研究使用了生态生理学框架，分析了温度和氧气对海洋生物分布的共同影响，并利用变点分析方法检测了海洋栖息地变化的趋势。研究发现，海洋酸化和缺氧会导致海洋栖息地减少，并可能对海洋生物的生存构成威胁。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，主要关注海洋环境变化及其对海洋生态系统的影响。
10.1029/2024EF004878,Impacts of Forest Management‐Induced Productivity Changes on Future Land Use and Land Cover Change,"Anthropogenic land use and land cover change (LULCC) is projected to continue in the future. However, the influence of forest management on forest productivity change and subsequent LULCC projections remains under‐investigated. This study explored the impacts of forest management‐induced change in forest productivity on LULCC throughout the 21st century. Specifically, we developed a framework to softly couple the Global Change Analysis Model and Global Timber Model to consider forest management‐induced forest productivity change and projected future LULCC across the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). We found future increases in forest management intensity overall drive the increase of forest productivity. The forest management‐induced forest productivity change shows diverse responses across all SSPs, with a global increase from 2015 to 2100 ranging from 3.9% (SSP3) to 8.8% (SSP1). This further leads to an overall decrease in the total area with a change of land use types, with the largest decrease under SSP1 (−7.5%) and the smallest decrease under SSP3 (−0.7%) in 2100. Among land use types, considering forest management‐induced change significantly reduces the expansion of managed forest and also reduces the loss of natural land in 2100 across SSPs. This suggests that ignoring forest management‐induced forest productivity change underestimates the efficiency of wood production, overestimates the managed forest expansion required to meet the future demand, and consequently, potentially introduces uncertainties into relevant analyses, for example, carbon cycle and biodiversity. Thus, we advocate to better account for the impacts of forest management in future LULCC projections.",Meng Luo;Adam Daigneault;Xin Zhao;Dalei Hao;Min Chen,Earth's Future,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要探讨了森林管理对森林生产力变化的影响，以及这种变化对未来土地利用和土地覆盖变化的影响。研究使用全球变化分析模型和全球木材模型，模拟了不同社会经济情景下森林管理对森林生产力的影响，并分析了其对土地利用和土地覆盖变化的影响。研究发现，森林管理强度提高会增加森林生产力，但对不同社会经济情景的影响有所不同。森林管理对土地利用和土地覆盖变化的影响主要体现在减少了管理森林的扩张和自然土地的损失。因此，论文强调了在未来的土地利用和土地覆盖变化预测中，需要更好地考虑森林管理的影响。论文没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。
10.1029/2024EF005011,IMO2020 Regulations Accelerate Global Warming by up to 3 Years in UKESM1,"The International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced new regulations on the sulfur content of shipping emissions in 2020 (IMO2020). Estimates of the climatic impact of this global reduction in anthropogenic sulfate aerosols vary widely. Here, we contribute to narrowing this uncertainty with two sets of climate model simulations using UKESM1. Using fixed sea‐surface temperature atmosphere‐only simulations, we estimate an IMO2020 global effective radiative forcing of 0.139 ± 0.019 Wm−2 and show that most of this forcing is due to aerosol‐induced changes to cloud properties. Using coupled ocean‐atmosphere simulations, we note significant changes in cloud top droplet number concentration and size across regions with high shipping traffic density, and—in the North Atlantic and North Pacific—these microphysical changes translate to a decrease in cloud albedo. We show that IMO2020 increases global annual surface temperature on average by 0.046 ± 0.010°C across 2020–2029; approximately 2–3 years of global warming. Furthermore, our model simulations show that IMO2020 helps to explain the exceptional warming in 2023, but other factors are needed to fully account for it. The year 2023 also had an exceptionally large decrease in reflected shortwave radiation at the top‐of‐atmosphere. Our results show that IMO2020 made that more likely, yet the observations are within the variability of simulations without the reduction in shipping emissions.

10.1029/2023EF004266,Persistent Extreme Surface Solar Radiation and Its Implications on Solar Photovoltaics,"Climatic extreme events are important because they can strongly impact humans, infrastructure, and biodiversity and will be affected by a changing climate. Surface Solar Radiation (SSR) is the primary energy source for solar photovoltaics (PV), which will be indispensable in future zero‐emissions energy systems. Despite their pivotal role, extreme events in SSR remain under‐documented. We provide a starting point in extreme SSR analysis by focusing on events caused by internal variability alone and therefore building a baseline for future extreme SSR research. We analyze extreme SSR events using daily‐mean data from the pre‐industrial control simulations (piControl) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—Phase 6. We investigate their role in PV energy generation using the Global Solar Energy Estimator with the intent of strengthening the energy system's resilience. Our results show a pronounced asymmetry between consecutive days with extremely high and extremely low solar radiation over land, the former occurring more frequently than the latter. Moreover, our results call for detailed PV generation modeling that includes panel geometry. Simple models based on linear SSR representations prove insufficient due to pronounced seasonal variations and strong non‐linear SSR dependency of high extremes.

This paper considers the utility of proactively developing the capacity to respond to emergent tipping element threats at the poles as a matter of risk management.

Vegetation Burn Severity (VBS) can be derived from satellite observations. However, Soil Burn Severity (SBS) assessment—critical for mitigating hydrologic and geologic hazards—requires costly and laborious field recalibration of VBS maps. Here, we develop a physics‐informed Machine Learning model capable of accurately estimating SBS while revealing the intricate relationships between soil and vegetation burn severities. Our SBS classification model uses VBS, as well as climatological, meteorological, ecological, geological, and topographical wildfire covariates. This model demonstrated an overall accuracy of 89% for out‐of‐sample test data. The model exhibited scalability with additional data, and was able to extract universal functional relationships between vegetation and soil burn severities across the western US. VBS had the largest control on SBS, followed by weather (e.g., wind, fire danger, temperature), climate (e.g., annual precipitation), topography (e.g., elevation), and soil characteristics (e.g., soil organic carbon content). The relative control of processes on SBS changes across regions. Our model revealed nuanced relationships between VBS and SBS; for example, a similar VBS with lower wind speeds—that is, higher fire residence time—translates to a higher SBS. This transferrable model develops reliable and timely SBS maps using satellite and publicly accessible data, providing science‐based insights for managers and diverse stakeholders.",Seyd Teymoor Seydi;John T.

10.1029/2024EF004523,Assessing Current Coastal Subsidence at Continental Scale: Insights From Europe Using the European Ground Motion Service,"Beside climate‐change‐induced sea‐level rise (SLR), land subsidence can strongly amplify coastal risk in flood‐prone areas. Mapping and quantifying contemporary vertical land motion (VLM) at continental scales has long been a challenge due to the absence of gridded observational products covering these large domains. Here, we fill this gap by using the new European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) to assess the current state of coastal VLM in Europe. First, we compare the InSAR‐based EGMS Ortho (Level 3) with nearby global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) vertical velocity estimates and show that the geodetic reference frame used to calibrate EGMS strongly influences coastal vertical land velocity estimates at the millimeter per year level and this needs to be considered with caution. After adjusting the EGMS vertical velocity estimates to a more updated and accurate International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2014), we performed an assessment of VLM in European low elevation coastal flood plains (CFPs). We find that nearly half of the European CFP area is, on average, subsiding at a rate faster than 1 mm/yr. More importantly, we find that urban areas and populations located in the CFP experience a near −1 mm/yr VLM on average (excluding the uplifting Fennoscandia region). For harbors, the average VLM is even larger and increases to −1.5 mm/yr on average. This demonstrates the widespread importance of continental‐scale assessments based on InSAR and GNSS to better identify areas at higher risk from relative SLR due to coastal subsidence.",Rémi Thiéblemont;Gonéri Le Cozannet;Robert J.

10.1029/2023EF003740,Future Drought‐Induced Tree Mortality Risk in Amazon Rainforest,"The future evolution of the Amazon rainforest remains uncertain not only due to uncertain climate projections, but also owing to the intricate balance between tree growth and mortality. Many Earth System Models inadequately represent forest demography processes, especially drought‐induced tree mortality. In this study, we used ORCHIDEE‐CAN‐NHA, a land surface model featuring a mechanistic hydraulic architecture, a tree mortality sub‐model linked to a critical loss of stem conductance and a forest demography module for simulating regrowth. The model was forced by bias‐corrected climate forcing data from the ISIMIP‐2 program, considering two scenarios and four different climate models to project biomass changes in the Amazon rainforest until 2100. These climate models display diverse patterns of climate change across the Amazon region. The simulation conducted with the HadGEM climate model reveals the most significant drying trend, suggesting that the Guiana Shield and East‐central Amazon are approaching a tipping point. These two regions are projected to transition from carbon sinks to carbon sources by the mid‐21st century, with the Brazilian Shield following suit around 2060. This transition is attributed to heightened drought‐induced carbon loss in the future.

10.1029/2024EF004563,Large Divergence of Projected High Latitude Vegetation Composition and Productivity Due To Functional Trait Uncertainty,"Vegetation distribution and composition are expected to change in northern high latitudes under rapid warming, which regulates ecosystem functions but remains challenging to predict. Vegetation change arises from the interplay of chronic climate trends such as warming and transient demographic processes of recruitment, growth, competition, and mortality. Most predictive models overlooked the role of demographic dynamics controlled by plant traits. Here, we simulate vegetation dynamics at the Kougarok Hillslope site in Alaska under historical and future climates using the E3SM Land Model coupled to the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Simulator (ELM‐FATES). To evaluate the roles of plant traits, we parameterize the model with 5,265 trait configurations representing diverse physiological and demographic strategies. Results show current modeled biomass, composition, and productivity are most sensitive to traits controlling photosynthetic capacity, carbon allocation, allometry, and phenology. Among all trait configurations, ∼5% reproduce in situ biomass and plant functional type (PFT) composition measured in 2016, that are indistinguishable from these two observed ecosystem states. Notably, these same trait configurations produce diverging biomass, composition, and productivity under future climate, where the uncertainty attributable to traits is twice the change attributable to climate change. The variation of projected productivity arises from emerging PFT composition under novel climate regimes, primarily explained by traits controlling cold‐induced mortality, recruitment, and allometry. Our findings highlight the importance and uncertainty of demographic dynamics and its interaction with climate change in shaping Arctic vegetation change.

The region has frequently been affected by severe droughts and food crises over the last several decades, which will likely increase in future. Therefore, exploring novel methods of increasing early warning capabilities is of vital importance to reducing food‐insecurity risk. We present a XGBoost machine‐learning model to predict food‐security crises up to 12 months in advance. We used >20 data sets and the FEWS IPC current‐situation estimates to train the machine‐learning model. Food‐security dynamics were captured effectively by the model up to 3 months in advance (R2 > 0.6). Specifically, we predicted 20% of crisis onsets in pastoral regions (n = 96) and 20%–50% of crisis onsets in agro‐pastoral regions (n = 22) with a 3‐month lead time. We also compared our 8‐month model predictions to the 8‐month food‐security outlooks produced by FEWS NET. Over a relatively short test period (2019–2022), results suggest the performance of our predictions is similar to FEWS NET for agro‐pastoral and pastoral regions.

10.1029/2024EF004516,Summer Monsoon Drying Accelerates India's Groundwater Depletion Under Climate Change,"Groundwater in north India remains a vital food and water security resource for more than one billion people. Both summer monsoon drying, and winter warming pose considerable challenges for rapidly declining groundwater. However, their impacts on irrigation water demands and groundwater storage under the observed and projected future climate remain unexplored. Using in situ observations, satellite data, and a hydrological model that considers the role of irrigation and groundwater pumping, we show that summer monsoon drying and winter warming accelerate groundwater depletion in north India during the observed climate, which will continue in the projected future climate. Summer monsoon precipitation has significantly (P‐value = 0.04) declined (∼8%) while winters have become warmer in north India during 1951–2021. Both satellite (GRACE/GRACE‐FO) and hydrological model‐based estimates show a rapid groundwater depletion (∼1.5 cm/year) in north India with a net loss of 450 km3 of groundwater during 2002–2021. The summer monsoon drying followed by winter warming cause a substantial reduction in groundwater storage due to reduced groundwater recharge and enhanced pumping to meet irrigation demands. Summer monsoon drying and winter warming will continue to affect groundwater storage in north India in the future. For instance, summer monsoon drying (10%–15% deficit for near‐far periods) followed by substantial winter warming (1–4°C) in the future will further accelerate groundwater depletion by increasing (6%–20%) irrigation water demands and reducing groundwater recharge (6%–12%).

10.1029/2024EF004737,Understanding Climate Change and Anthropogenic Impacts on the Salinization of Low‐Lying Coastal Groundwater Systems,"Fresh coastal groundwater is a valuable water resource of global significance, but its quality is threatened by saltwater intrusion. Excessive groundwater abstraction, sea‐level rise (SLR), land subsidence and other climate‐related factors are expected to accelerate this process in the future. The objective of this study is to (a) quantify the impact of projected climate change and (b) explore the role of individual hydrogeological boundaries on groundwater salinization of low‐lying coastal groundwater systems until 2100 CE. We employ numerical density‐dependent groundwater flow and salt transport modeling for this purpose, using Northwestern Germany as a case. Separate model variants are constructed and forced with climate data, that is, projected SLR and groundwater recharge, as well as likely ranges of other hydrogeological boundaries, including land subsidence, abstraction rates and drain levels. We find that autonomous salinization in the marsh areas, resulting from non‐equilibrium of the present‐day groundwater salinity distribution with current boundary conditions, is responsible for >50% of the salinization increase until 2100 CE. Sea‐level rise, land subsidence and drain levels are the other major factors controlling salinization. We further show that salinization of the water resources is a potential threat to coastal water users, including water suppliers and the agrarian sector, as well as coastal ecosystems. Regional‐scale uplifting of drain levels is identified as an efficient measure to mitigate salinization of deep and shallow groundwater in the future.

10.1029/2023EF004292,Anomalous Water Vapor Circulation in an Extreme Drought Event of the Mid‐Reaches of the Lancang‐Mekong River Basin,"The middle reaches of the Lancang‐Mekong River Basin (M‐LMRB) experienced a record‐breaking drought event in 2019, resulting in significant economic losses of approximately 650 million dollars and affecting a population of 17 million. However, the anomalous circulation and transportation processes of water vapor, which may have played a crucial role in inducing the extreme drought, have not been fully studied. In this study, we analyze the water vapor circulation during the 2019 drought event using the land‐atmosphere water balance and a backward trajectory model for moisture tracking. Our results indicate that the precipitation in the M‐LMRB from May to October 2019 was only 71.9% of the long‐term climatological mean (1959–2021). The low precipitation during this drought event can be attributed to less‐than‐normal external water vapor supply. Specifically, the backward trajectory model reveals a decrease in the amount of water vapor transported from the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the Pacific Ocean, which are the main moisture sources for precipitation in the region. Comparing the atmospheric circulation patterns in 2019 with the climatology, we identify anomalous anticyclone conditions in the Bay of Bengal, anomalous westerlies in the Northeast Indian Ocean, and an anomalous cyclone in the Western Pacific Ocean, collectively facilitating a stronger export of water vapor from the region. Therefore, the dynamic processes played a more significant role than thermodynamic processes in contributing to the 2019 extreme drought event.",Guoqing Gong;Shuyu Zhang;Baoni Li;Yufan Chen;Penghan Chen;Kai Wang;Thian Yew Gan;Deliang Chen;Junguo Liu,Earth's Future,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要研究了澜沧江-湄公河中游2019年极端干旱事件期间的水汽循环异常现象。研究通过分析陆气水分平衡和反向轨迹模型，发现干旱期间降水量低于正常水平，主要原因是来自印度洋、孟加拉湾和太平洋的水汽供应减少。论文重点关注了大气环流模式的变化，例如孟加拉湾反气旋、东北印度洋西风和西太平洋气旋的异常，导致了水汽的出口增强。因此，论文主要关注的是大气环流和水汽输送对干旱事件的影响，并没有涉及到大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。

The event was accompanied by drier conditions driven by prolonged atmospheric blocking. During the heatwave, the maximum 6‐day means of humidex and temperature (HX‐6 and TX‐6) exhibited larger anomalies (6.70 and 5.57°C) compared to the 95th percentiles (HX95 and TX95) (4.12 and 3.73°C), relative to 1981–2021 extended summer (June‐September) averages. Extreme indices of humidex show faster and larger increases than those of temperature, reflecting the nonlinear positive relationship between humidex and temperature. Future projections from a multi‐model ensemble of 19 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase six (CMIP6) Global Climate Models (GCMs) clearly show an increase in humidex and temperature extremes, especially under intermediate and high emissions scenarios. Humidex indices (HX‐6 and HX95) show faster and larger increases than temperature indices (TX‐6 and TX95) for the same future years and global warming levels.

10.1029/2023EF003647,"Robust Hydropower Planning Balances Energy Generation, Carbon Emissions and Sediment Connectivity in the Mekong River Basin","We present a framework for strategic dam planning under uncertainty, which includes GHG emissions mitigation as a novel objective. We focus on the Mekong River Basin, a fast‐developing region heavily relying on river‐derived ecosystem services. We employ a multi‐objective evolutionary algorithm to identify strategic dam portfolios for different hydropower expansion targets, using process‐related and statistical models to derive indicators of sediment supply disruption and GHG emissions. We introduce a robust optimization approach that explores variations in optimal portfolio compositions for more than 5,000 state‐of‐the‐world configurations, regarding sediment origins and trapping and GHG emissions. Thus, we can rank dam projects' attractiveness based on their frequency of inclusion in optimal portfolios and explore how uncertainty affects these rankings. Our results suggest that developing dams in the upper Mekong would be a more robust option for near‐term development than, for example, the lower Mekong and its tributaries, for both environmental and energy objectives.

Satellite imagery and stream gage measurements indicate that surface wetting coincided with this warming more than 2 months after peak summer thaw and likely exceeded thresholds for rehydration and activation of resident organisms that typically survive the cold and dry conditions of the polar fall in a freeze‐dried state. This weather event is notable in both the timing and magnitude of the warming and wetting when temperatures exceeded 0°C at a time when biological communities and streams have typically entered a persistent frozen state. Such events may be a harbinger of future climate conditions characterized by warmer temperatures and greater thaw in this region of Antarctica, which could influence the distribution, activity, and abundance of sentinel taxa.

10.1029/2024EF004500,Enhanced Carbon Accumulation in China's New Coastal Wetlands Over the 21st Century,"Wetlands formed by natural sediment deposition account for a large proportion of new coastal lands, and these new wetlands usually have active ecosystems and obvious ecological effects. However, previous studies largely overlooked this sediment‐caused wetland expansion, and the spatiotemporal variation in these wetlands and future response to sea‐level rise (SLR) have not been determined. Here, we employed satellite observations to quantify the seaward expansion of coastal lands in China over the past two decades. A total land expansion of 6,651 km2 was found, and wetlands and artificial surfaces dominated, accounting for 32% and 25%, respectively. Subsequently, we utilized an integrated model to estimate the response of these new wetlands to SLR in the 21st century, that is, we estimated the wetland gain from sediment deposition and loss due to SLR. The results indicate that under the current condition of sediment availability, the area of China's new coastal wetlands is projected to increase by 200%–261% compared to that in 2020 based on four SLR scenarios, despite the unavoidable impact of SLR. These increases are accompanied by the continuous enhancement of carbon accumulation. Wetland changes are influenced by factors such as sediment deposition, SLR and storm surges, as well as the continued effect of local natural and anthropogenic factors. These results show the importance of understanding the ecological effects of new wetlands and constructing specific protection measures for sustainable development.",Xiaoyi Shen;Chang‐Qing Ke;Yu Cai;Haili Li;Yao Xiao,Earth's Future,TRUE,"['satellite observations', 'carbon accumulation', 'wetland expansion', 'sea-level rise']",这篇论文研究了中国沿海地区新的湿地扩张，利用卫星观测数据量化了近二十年来海岸线向海扩张的面积，并预测了未来海平面上升对新湿地扩张的影响。论文重点关注了新湿地对碳积累的影响，以及湿地扩张带来的生态效应。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是在利用卫星数据监测地表变化和碳循环方面。

10.1029/2024JD041170,The Abundance and Sources of Ice Nucleating Particles Within Alaskan Ice Fog,"The Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) field campaign included deployment of a suite of atmospheric measurements in January–February 2022 with the goal of better understanding atmospheric processes and pollution under cold and dark conditions in Fairbanks, Alaska. We report on measurements of particle composition, particle size, ice nucleating particle (INP) composition, and INP size during an ice fog period (29 January–3 February). During this period, coarse particulate matter (PM10) concentrations increased by 150% in association with a decrease in air temperature, a stronger temperature inversion, and relatively stagnant conditions. Results also show a 18%–78% decrease in INPs during the ice fog period, indicating that particles had activated into the ice fog via nucleation. Peroxide and heat treatments performed on INPs indicated that, on average, the largest contributions to the INP population were heat‐labile (potentially biological, 63%), organic (31%), then inorganic (likely dust, 6%). Measurements of levoglucosan and bulk and single‐particle composition corroborate the presence of dust and aerosols from combustion sources. Heat‐labile and organic INPs decreased during the peak period of the ice fog, indicating those were preferentially activated, while inorganic INPs increased, suggesting they remained as interstitial INPs. In general, INP concentrations were unexpectedly high in Fairbanks compared to other locations in the Arctic during winter. The fact that these INPs likely facilitated ice fog formation in Fairbanks has implications for other high latitude locations subject to the hazards associated with ice fog.",Emily Lill;Emily J.

10.1029/2023JD040687,The Influence of Stratospheric Hydration From the Hunga Eruption on Chemical Processing in the 2023 Antarctic Vortex,"We use measurements of trace gases from the Microwave Limb Sounder and polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) from the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization to investigate how the extraordinary stratospheric water vapor enhancement from the 2022 Hunga eruption affected polar processing during the 2023 Antarctic winter. Although the dynamical characteristics of the vortex itself were generally unexceptional, the excess moisture initially raised PSC formation threshold temperatures above typical values. Cold conditions, especially in early July, prompted ice PSC formation and unusually severe irreversible dehydration at higher levels (500–700 K), while atypical hydration occurred at lower levels (380–460 K). Heterogeneous chemical processing was more extensive, both vertically (up to 750–800 K) and temporally (earlier in the season), than in prior Antarctic winters. The resultant HCl depletion and ClO enhancement redefined their previously observed ranges at and above 600 K. Albeit unmatched in the satellite record, the early‐winter upper‐level chlorine activation was insufficient to induce substantial ozone loss. Chlorine activation, denitrification, and dehydration processes ran to completion by July/August, with trace gas evolution mostly following the climatological mean thereafter, but with chlorine deactivation starting slightly later than usual. While cumulative ozone losses at 410–550 K were relatively large, probably because of the delayed chlorine deactivation, they were not unprecedented. Thus, ozone depletion was unremarkable throughout the lower stratosphere. Although Hunga enhanced PSC formation and chemical processing in early winter, saturation of lower stratospheric denitrification, dehydration, and chlorine activation (as is typical in the Antarctic) prevented an exceptionally severe ozone hole in 2023.",M.

10.1029/2024JD041308,First High‐Resolution Vertical Profiles of Methane in the Troposphere Over India,"Methane (CH4) is the second most abundant greenhouse gas and affects the Earth's radiative balance. In some regions, the methane burden and budget are still not well understood due to the lack of in situ observations, especially vertical profile observations. Here, we present the first high‐resolution aircraft‐based tropospheric vertical profiles of CH4 across the Indian subcontinent. Observations show significant variability, with the largest variability seen in the Indo‐Gangetic Plain (IGP) during post‐monsoon (September). The IGP also shows the highest concentrations and a peak in the boundary layer. By contrast, observations over western India show lower variability, especially during the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) (July). During ASM, when CH4 emissions peak, the vertical updraft of CH4 and other tracers is observed, leading to a peak between 4 and 5 km. During winter, the peak occurs in the boundary layer, and a decrease with altitude is observed. Model simulations slightly overestimate CH4 at the surface during some seasons but underestimate it at higher altitudes during all seasons. Integrated over the observed column, model simulations slightly underpredict CH4 (0.5%–3.1%) during all seasons.

 The ability to learn novel items depends on brain functions that store information about items classified by their associated meanings and outcomes1–4, but the underlying neural circuit mechanisms of this process remain poorly understood. Here we show that deep layers of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) contain two groups of ‘item–outcome neurons’: one developing activity for rewarded items during learning, and another for punished items. As mice learned an olfactory item–outcome association, we found that the neuronal population of LEC layers 5/6 (LECL5/6) formed an internal map of pre-learned and novel items, classified into dichotomic rewarded versus punished groups. Neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which form a bidirectional loop circuit with LECL5/6, developed an equivalent item–outcome rule map during learning. When LECL5/6 neurons were optogenetically inhibited, tangled mPFC representations of novel items failed to split into rewarded versus punished groups, impairing new learning by mice. Conversely, when mPFC neurons were inhibited, LECL5/6 representations of individual items were held completely separate, disrupting both learning and retrieval of associations. These results suggest that LECL5/6 neurons and mPFC neurons co-dependently encode item memory as a map of associated outcome rules.

 Owing to their capability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under solar irradiation, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with pre-designable structure and unique architectures show great potentials for water purification. However, the sluggish charge separation, inefficient oxygen activation and poor structure stability in COFs restrict their practical applications to decontaminate water. Herein, via a facile one-pot synthetic strategy, we show the direct conversion of reversible imine linkage into rigid thiazole linkage can adjust the π-conjugation and local charge polarization of skeleton to boost the exciton dissociation on COFs. The rigid linkage can also improve the robustness of skeleton and the stability of COFs during the consecutive utilization process. More importantly, the thiazole linkage in COFs with optimal C 2p states (COF-S) effectively increases the activities of neighboring benzene unit to directly modulate the O2-adsorption energy barrier and improve the ROS production efficiency, resulting in the excellent photocatalytic degradation efficiency of seven toxic emerging contaminants (e.g. degrading ~99% of 5 mg L−1 paracetamol in only 7 min) and effective bacterial/algal inactivation performance. Besides, COF-S can be immobilized in continuous-flow reactor and in enlarged reactor to efficiently eliminate pollutants under natural sunlight irradiation, demonstrating the feasibility for practical application.

 The dynamic regulation of mitochondria shape via fission and fusion is critical for cellular responses to stimuli. In homeostatic cells, two modes of mitochondrial fission, midzone and peripheral, provide a decision fork between either proliferation or clearance of mitochondria. However, the relationship between specific mitochondria shapes and functions remains unclear in many biological contexts. While commonly associated with decreased bioenergetics, fragmented mitochondria paradoxically exhibit elevated respiration in several disease states, including infection with the prevalent pathogen human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and metastatic melanoma. Here, incorporating super-resolution microscopy with mass spectrometry and metabolic assays, we use HCMV infection to establish a molecular mechanism for maintaining respiration within a fragmented mitochondria population. We establish that HCMV induces fragmentation through peripheral mitochondrial fission coupled with suppression of mitochondria fusion. Unlike uninfected cells, the progeny of peripheral fission enter mitochondria-ER encapsulations (MENCs) where they are protected from degradation and bioenergetically stabilized during infection. MENCs also stabilize pro-viral inter-mitochondria contacts (IMCs), which electrochemically link mitochondria and promote respiration. Demonstrating a broader relevance, we show that the fragmented mitochondria within metastatic melanoma cells also form MENCs. Our findings establish a mechanism where mitochondria fragmentation can promote increased respiration, a feature relevant in the context of human diseases.

A digital approach is proposed to harness these complex paths and reveal the inner structure of opaque media. 
 As light travels through a disordered medium such as biological tissues, it undergoes multiple scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to in-depth optical microscopy, as it causes a drastic degradation of contrast, resolution and brightness of the resulting image beyond a few scattering mean free paths. However, the information about the inner reflectivity of the sample is not lost; only scrambled. To recover this information, a matrix approach of optical imaging can be fruitful. Here, we report on a de-scanned measurement of a high-dimension reflection matrix R via low coherence interferometry. Then, we show how a set of independent focusing laws can be extracted for each medium voxel through an iterative multi-scale analysis of wave distortions contained in R. It enables an optimal and local compensation of forward multiple scattering paths and provides a three-dimensional confocal image of the sample as the latter one had become digitally transparent. The proof-of-concept experiment is performed on a human opaque cornea and an extension of the penetration depth by a factor five is demonstrated compared to the state-of-the-art.

 Annotating active sites in enzymes is crucial for advancing multiple fields including drug discovery, disease research, enzyme engineering, and synthetic biology. Despite the development of numerous automated annotation algorithms, a significant trade-off between speed and accuracy limits their large-scale practical applications. We introduce EasIFA, an enzyme active site annotation algorithm that fuses latent enzyme representations from the Protein Language Model and 3D structural encoder, and then aligns protein-level information with the knowledge of enzymatic reactions using a multi-modal cross-attention framework. EasIFA outperforms BLASTp with a 10-fold speed increase and improved recall, precision, f1 score, and MCC by 7.57%, 13.08%, 9.68%, and 0.1012, respectively.

This makes EasIFA a suitable replacement for conventional tools in both industrial and academic settings. EasIFA can also effectively transfer knowledge gained from coarsely annotated enzyme databases to smaller, high-precision datasets, highlighting its ability to model sparse and high-quality databases.

Here, the authors report the realization of PTE graphene photodetectors integrated with a metamaterial perfect absorber, showing a 3-dB bandwidth above 400 GHz. 
 Photodetection in the near- and mid-infrared spectrum requires a suitable absorbing material able to meet the respective targets while ideally being cost-effective. Graphene, with its extraordinary optoelectronic properties, could provide a material basis simultaneously serving both regimes. The zero-band gap offers almost wavelength independent absorption which lead to photodetectors operating in the infrared spectrum. However, to keep noise low, a detection mechanism with fast and zero bias operation would be needed. Here, we show a self-powered graphene photodetector with a > 400 GHz frequency response.

Here, the authors investigate the hypothesis that this rebound occurs when transmission intensity remains above a minimum threshold value, at which prevalence and strain diversity decrease sharply with further intervention. 
 Intervention efforts against falciparum malaria in high-transmission regions remain challenging, with rapid resurgence typically following their relaxation. Such resilience co-occurs with incomplete immunity and a large transmission reservoir from high asymptomatic prevalence. Incomplete immunity relates to the large antigenic variation of the parasite, with the major surface antigen of the blood stage of infection encoded by the multigene and recombinant family known as var. With a stochastic agent-based model, we investigate the existence of a sharp transition in resurgence ability with intervention intensity and identify molecular indicators informative of its proximity. Their application to survey data with deep sampling of var sequences from individual isolates in northern Ghana suggests that the transmission system was brought close to transition by intervention with indoor residual spraying. These results indicate that sustaining and intensifying intervention would have pushed malaria dynamics to a slow-rebound regime with an increased probability of local parasite extinction. When malaria interventions are relaxed in high transmission settings, incidence often rebounds to pre-intervention levels.

Here, the authors report single-cell laser emitting cytometry, which can profile nucleoli in single cells and tissues in a label-free manner. 
 The nucleolus, a recognized biomolecular condensate, serves as the hub for ribosome biogenesis within the cell nucleus. Its quantity and morphology are discernible indicators of cellular functional states. However, precise identification and quantification of nucleoli remain challenging without specific labeling, particularly for suspended cells, tissue-level analysis and high-throughput applications. Here we introduce a single-cell laser emitting cytometry (SLEC) for label-free nucleolus differentiation through light-matter interactions within a Fabry–Perot resonator. The separated gain medium enhances the threshold difference by 36-fold between nucleolus and its surroundings, enabling selective laser emissions at nucleolar area while maintaining lower-order mode. The laser emission image provides insights into structural inhomogeneity, temporal fluid-like dynamics, and pathological application.

10.1038/s41467-024-51777-w,Formation of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation lower limb is critically dependent on Atlantic-Arctic mixing,"The authors use a global eddy-resolving ocean model and show that the Atlantic-Arctic mixing is necessary for determining the density and depth of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation return flow. 
 Deep-water formation in the eastern Subpolar North Atlantic Ocean (eSPNA) and Nordic Seas is crucial for maintaining the lower limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), of consequence for global climate. However, it is still uncertain which processes determine the deep-water formation and how much Atlantic and Arctic waters respectively contribute to the lower limb. To address this, here we used Lagrangian trajectories to diagnose a global eddy-resolving ocean model that agrees well with recent observations highlighting the eSPNA as a primary source of the AMOC lower limb. Comprised of 72% Atlantic waters and 28% Arctic waters, the density and depth of the AMOC lower limb is critically dependent on Atlantic-Arctic mixing, primarily in the vicinity of Denmark Strait. In contrast, Atlantic waters gaining density through air-sea interaction along the eastern periphery of Nordic Seas and not entering the Arctic Ocean make a negligible contribution to the lower limb.

10.1029/2023AV001151,Escalating Wildfires in Siberia Driven by Climate Feedbacks Under a Warming Arctic in the 21st Century,"Siberian wildfire is of paramount importance in the carbon cycle and climate change as it is a major disturbance in the pan‐Arctic ecosystems. In recent decades, the Siberian wildfire regime has been shifting; however, less is known about its process‐based feedback mechanisms. By integrating in‐situ and satellite observational data sets as well as chemistry‐climate coupled modeling, we find that central Siberia has featured the most prominent wildfire escalation during the past two decades, which is closely related to hydrological drought with decreasing rainfall and drying soil under a fast‐warming Arctic. Furthermore, fire‐emitted aerosols compound the increasing wildfires via serving as cloud condensation nuclei and suppressing precipitation, forming self‐amplifying feedback. As the Arctic warming is projected to continue, wildfires are estimated to more than double by the end of this century. This work highlights the great importance of fire risk management based on a fundamental scientific understanding of the complex climate system.",Xin Huang;Lian Xue;Zilin Wang;Yawen Liu;Ke Ding;Aijun Ding,AGU Advances,TRUE,"['aerosols', 'satellite observations', 'fire emissions', 'air quality monitoring', 'climate change']",该研究探讨了西伯利亚野火与气候变化之间的相互作用，并利用卫星观测数据和气候模型分析了野火对大气环境的影响。研究发现，西伯利亚野火排放的烟雾气溶胶会影响云的形成和降水，形成正反馈循环，加剧野火。这项研究强调了利用卫星观测和大气成分分析等遥感技术监测和管理野火风险的重要性。
10.1029/2023AV001000,Distribution and Drivers of Organic Carbon Sedimentation Along the Continental Margins,"Organic carbon (OC) sedimentation in marine sediments is the largest long‐term sink of atmospheric CO2 after silicate weathering. Understanding the mechanistic and quantitative aspects of OC delivery and preservation in marine sediments is critical for predicting the role of the oceans in modulating global climate. Yet, estimates of the global OC sedimentation in marginal settings span an order of magnitude, and the primary controls of OC preservation remain highly debated. Here, we provide the first global bottom‐up estimate of OC sedimentation along the margins using a synthesis of literature data. We quantify both terrestrial‐ and marine‐sourced OC fluxes and perform a statistical analysis to discern the key factors influencing their magnitude. We find that the margins host 23.2 ± 3.5 Tmol of OC sedimentation annually, with approximately 84% of marine origin. Accordingly, we calculate that only 2%–3% of OC exported from the euphotic zone escapes remineralization before sedimentation. Surprisingly, over half of all global OC sedimentation occurs below bottom waters with oxygen concentrations greater than 180 μM, while less than 4% occurs in settings with <50 μM oxygen. This challenges the prevailing paradigm that bottom‐water oxygen (BWO) is the primary control on OC preservation. Instead, our statistical analysis reveals that water depth is the most significant predictor of OC sedimentation, surpassing all other factors investigated, including BWO levels and sea‐surface chlorophyll concentrations. This finding suggests that the primary control on OC sedimentation is not production, but the ability of OC to resist remineralization during transit through the water column and while settling on the seafloor.",Logan A.

The link between the drought impact and recovery of the total carbon pools and its biogeochemical drivers is still unknown. With satellite‐constrained net carbon exchange and its component fluxes including gross primary production and fire emissions, we show that the total carbon loss caused by the 2015–2016 El Niño had not recovered by the end of 2018. Forest ecosystems over the Northeastern (NE) Amazon suffered a cumulative total carbon loss of ∼0.6 GtC through December 2018, driven primarily by a suppression of photosynthesis whereas southeastern savannah carbon loss was driven in part by fire. We attribute the slow recovery to the unexpected large carbon loss caused by the severe atmospheric aridity coupled with a water storage deficit during drought. We show the attenuation of carbon uptake is three times higher than expected from the pre‐drought sensitivity to atmospheric aridity and ground water supply. Our study fills an important knowledge gap in our understanding of the unexpectedly enhanced response of carbon fluxes to atmospheric aridity and water storage deficit and its impact on regional post‐drought recovery as a function of the vegetation types and climate perturbations.

10.1029/2024AV001241,"Astrobiological Potential of Rocks Acquired by the Perseverance Rover at a Sedimentary Fan Front in Jezero Crater, Mars","The Perseverance rover has collected seven oriented samples of sedimentary rocks, all likely older than the oldest signs of widespread life on Earth, at the exposed base of the western fan in Jezero crater, Mars. The samples include a sulfate‐ and clay‐bearing mudstone and sandstone, a fluvial sandstone from a stratigraphically low position at the fan front, and a carbonate‐bearing sandstone deposited above the sulfate‐bearing strata. All samples contain aqueously precipitated materials and most or all were aqueously deposited. Although the rover instruments have not confidently detected organic matter in the rocks from the fan front, the much more sensitive terrestrial instruments will still be able to search for remnants of prebiotic chemistries and past life, and study Mars's past habitability in the samples returned to Earth. The hydrated, sulfate‐bearing mudstone has the highest potential to preserve organic matter and biosignatures, whereas the carbonate‐bearing sandstones can be used to constrain when and for how long Jezero crater contained liquid water. Returned sample science analyses of sulfate, carbonate, clay, phosphate and igneous minerals as well as trace metals and volatiles that are present in the samples acquired at the fan front would provide transformative insights into past habitable environments on Mars, the evolution of its magnetic field, atmosphere and climate and the past and present cycling of atmospheric and crustal water, sulfur and carbon.",T.

10.1029/2023AV001145,Toward Low‐Latency Estimation of Atmospheric CO2 Growth Rates Using Satellite Observations: Evaluating Sampling Errors of Satellite and In Situ Observing Approaches,"The atmospheric CO2 growth rate is a fundamental measure of climate forcing. NOAA's growth rate estimates, derived from in situ observations at the marine boundary layer (MBL), serve as the benchmark in policy and science. However, NOAA's MBL‐based method encounters challenges in accurately estimating the whole‐atmosphere CO2 growth rate at sub‐annual scales. Here we introduce the Growth Rate from Satellite Observations (GRESO) method as a complementary approach to estimate the whole‐atmosphere CO2 growth rate utilizing satellite data. Satellite CO2 observations offer extensive atmospheric coverage that extends the capability of the current NOAA benchmark. We assess the sampling errors of the GRESO and NOAA methods using 10 atmospheric transport model simulations. The simulations generate synthetic OCO‐2 satellite and NOAA MBL data for calculating CO2 growth rates, which are compared against the global sum of carbon fluxes used as model inputs. We find good performance for the NOAA method (R = 0.93, RMSE = 0.12 ppm year−1 or 0.25 PgC year−1). GRESO demonstrates lower sampling errors (R = 1.00; RMSE = 0.04 ppm year−1 or 0.09 PgC year−1). Additionally, GRESO shows better performance at monthly scales than the NOAA method (R = 0.76 vs. 0.47, respectively). Due to CO2's atmospheric longevity, the NOAA method accurately captures growth rates over 5‐year intervals. GRESO's robustness across partial coverage configurations (ocean or land data) shows that satellites can be promising tools for low‐latency CO2 growth rate information, provided the systematic biases are minimized using in situ observations. Along with accurate and calibrated NOAA in situ data, satellite‐derived growth rates can provide information about the global carbon cycle at sub‐annual scales.",Sudhanshu Pandey;John B.

10.1029/2024AV001265,Investigating Ultra‐Low Velocity Zones as Sources of PKP Scattering Beneath North America and the Western Pacific Ocean: Potential Links to Subducted Oceanic Crust,"Seismic energy arriving before the compressional (P) wave passing through the core (PKP), called PKP precursors, have been detected for decades, but the origin of those arrivals is ambiguous. The largest amplitude arrivals are linked to scattering at small‐scale lowermost mantle structure, but because these arrivals traverse both source and receiver sides of the mantle, it is unknown which side of the path the energy is scattered from. To address this ambiguity, we apply a new seismic array method to analyze PKP waveforms from 58 earthquakes recorded in North America that allows localization of the origin of the PKP precursors at the core‐mantle boundary (CMB). We compare these measurements with high frequency 2.5‐D synthetic predictions showing that the PKP precursors are most likely associated with ultra‐low velocity zone structures beneath the western Pacific and North America. The most feasible scenario to generate ULVZs in both locations is through melting of mid‐ocean ridge basalt in subducted oceanic crust.",Michael S.

Estimates of the organic mass fraction of sea spray vary widely, and some results show a significant dependence on biological activity in the source seawater. We present airborne observations of the organic mass fraction of individual sea spray particles measured using the Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry (PALMS) instrument during the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission, which sampled a wide range of latitudes and altitudes over the remote Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across four seasons, from the marine boundary layer to the upper troposphere. The measured sea spray particles of about 0.15–0.7 μm dry diameter showed higher average organic mass fractions at smaller sizes, but values were low overall, with regional integrated submicron means almost always <10%. Atmospheric aging adds organics to sea spray particles, leading to higher mean organic mass fractions (sometimes exceeding 50%) in the free troposphere than in the marine boundary layer. The average submicron sea spray organic mass fractions are on the low end of previously reported values and show weak seasonal variability for most regions. These results imply that recent biological activity in the surface ocean has only weak control over how much organic matter is in nascent submicron sea spray particles over the remote oceans, in contrast to findings from some observational studies and global numerical simulations.",Michael J.

There are, however, concerns that protons produced during SO2 oxidation may cause rapid acidification of aerosol water and thereby quickly shut down the fast reactions favored at high pH. Here, we show that the sustainability of sulfate production is controlled by the competing effects of multiphase buffering and acidification, which can be well described by a characteristic buffering time, τbuff. Both GEOS‐Chem simulations and observations show that globally, τbuff is long enough (days) to sustain sulfate production over most populated regions, where the acidification of aerosol water is counteracted by the strong buffering effect of NH4+/NH3.

This study quantified tree growth, water use efficiency, and carbon‐water tradeoffs of young versus mature/old‐growth forest in three small (13–22 ha) watersheds in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. To quantify and scale carbon‐water tradeoffs from trees to watersheds, tree‐ring records and greenness and wetness indices from remote sensing were combined with long‐term vegetation, climate, and streamflow data from young forest watersheds (trees ∼45 years of age) and from a mature/old‐growth forest watershed (trees 150–500 years of age). Biomass production was closely related to water use; water use efficiency (basal area increment per unit of evapotranspiration) was lower; and carbon‐water tradeoffs were steeper in young forest plantations compared with old‐growth forest for which the tree growth record begins in the 1850s. Greenness and wetness indices from Landsat imagery were not significant predictors of streamflow or tree growth over the period 1984 to 2017, and soil C and N did not differ significantly among watersheds. Multiple lines of evidence show that mature and old‐growth forest watersheds store and accumulate more carbon, are more drought resistant, and better sustain water availability compared to young forests. These results provide a basis for reconstructions and predictions that are potentially broadly applicable, because first‐order watersheds occupy 80%–90% of large river basins and study watersheds are representative of forest history in the Pacific Northwest region.",Michael D.

10.1029/2024AV001175,Permafrost Formation in a Meandering River Floodplain,"Permafrost influences 25% of land in the Northern Hemisphere, where it stabilizes the ground beneath communities and infrastructure and sequesters carbon. However, the coevolution of permafrost, river dynamics, and vegetation in Arctic environments remains poorly understood. As rivers meander, they erode the floodplain at cutbanks and build new land through bar deposition, creating sequences of landforms with distinct formation ages. Here we mapped these sequences along the Koyukuk River floodplain, Alaska, analyzing permafrost occurrence, and landform and vegetation types. We used radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to develop a floodplain age map. Deposit ages ranged from modern to 10 ka, with more younger deposits near the modern channel. Permafrost rapidly reached 50% areal extent in all deposits older than 200 years then gradually increased up to ∼85% extent for deposits greater than 4 Kyr old. Permafrost extent correlated with increases in black spruce and wetland abundance, as well as increases in permafrost extent within wetland, and shrub and scrub vegetation classes. We developed an inverse model to constrain permafrost formation rate as a function of air temperature. Permafrost extent initially increased by ∼25% per century, in pace with vegetation succession, before decelerating to <10% per millennia as insulating overbank mud and moss slowly accumulated. Modern permafrost extent on the Koyukuk floodplain therefore reflects a dynamic balance between widespread, time‐varying permafrost formation and rapid, localized degradation due to cutbank erosion that might trigger a rapid loss of permafrost with climatic warming.",Madison M.

10.1029/2023AV001155,"Characteristics of the Fault Damage Zone From High‐Resolution Seismic Imaging Along the Palos Verdes Fault, California","The distribution and intensity of fault damage zones provides insight into fault activity and its relationship to fluid flow in the crust. Presently, measures of the in‐situ distribution of fault damage remain limited and along‐strike studies are rare. This study focuses on an offshore section Palos Verdes Fault damage zone that spans 28 km, near Los Angeles, California. To investigate the previously unresolved shallow (∼400 m below the seafloor) fault damage zone we use densely spaced (∼500 m line separation) newly collected sparker multichannel seismic lines and sub‐bottom profiles. The combination of high‐resolution acquisition methods and specialized seismic processing workflows provide improved imaging of shallow faulting. We apply a multi‐trace similarity technique to identify discontinuities in the seismic data that may be attributed to faults and fractures. This fault detection approach reveals diverse fault damage patterns on adjacent seismic profiles. However, a discernible damage zone pattern emerges by stacking multiple damage detection profiles along strike. We find that peak damage identified in this way corresponds to the active main fault strand, confirmed in this study, and thus the technique may be useful for identifying active fault strands elsewhere. Additionally, we observe that the variable width of the damage zone along strike is controlled by fault obliquity. Furthermore, our observations reveal a correlation between fault damage and seafloor fluid seeps visible in the water column, suggesting that damage plays a role in controlling fluid flow around the fault.",Travis Alongi;Emily E.

10.1029/2023AV001121,Evolving Subduction Zone Thermal Structure Drives Extensive Forearc Mantle Wedge Hydration,"Hydration of the subduction zone forearc mantle wedge influences the downdip distribution of seismicity, the availability of fluids for arc magmatism, and Earth's long term water cycle. Reconstructions of present‐day subduction zone thermal structures using time‐invariant geodynamic models indicate relatively minor hydration, in contrast to many geophysical and geologic observations. We pair a dynamic, time‐evolving thermal model of subduction with phase equilibria modeling to investigate how variations in slab and forearc temperatures from subduction infancy through to maturity contribute to mantle wedge hydration. We find that thermal state during the intermediate period of subduction, as the slab freely descends through the upper mantle, promotes extensive forearc wedge hydration. In contrast, during early subduction the forearc is too hot to stabilize hydrous minerals in the mantle wedge, while during mature subduction, slab dehydration dominantly occurs beyond forearc depths. In our models, maximum wedge hydration during the intermediate phase is 60%–70% and falls to 20%–40% as quasi‐steady state conditions are approached during maturity. Comparison to global forearc H2O capacities reveals that consideration of thermal evolution leads to an order of magnitude increase in estimates for current extents of wedge hydration and provides better agreement with geophysical observations. This suggests that hydration of the forearc mantle wedge represents a potential vast reservoir of H2O, on the order of 3.4–5.9 × 1021 g globally. These results provide novel insights into the subduction zone water cycle, new constraints on the mantle wedge as a fluid reservoir and are useful to better understand geologic processes at plate margins.",G.

10.1029/2023AV001079,When a Plateau Suppresses a Plume: Disappearance of the Samoan Plume Under the Ontong Java Plateau,"The Samoan hotspot generated an age‐progressive volcanic track that can be traced back to 24 Ma at Alexa Bank, but the trace of the older portion (>24 Ma) of the hotspot track is unclear. We show that six seamounts located in and around the Magellan Seamount chain—north of the Ontong‐Java Plateau (OJP)—have ages (87–106 Ma), geochemistry, and locations consistent with absolute plate motion model reconstructions of the Samoan hotspot track in the late Cretaceous, and three additional seamounts have geochemistry and locations consistent with a Samoan origin. However, a large segment of the Samoan hotspot (24–87 Ma) remains unidentified. Absolute plate motion models show that, from ∼60 to 30 Ma, the OJP passed over the Samoan plume. The exceptional thickness of the OJP lithosphere may have largely suppressed Samoan plume melting because the inferred volcanic trace of the Samoan hotspot wanes, and then disappears, on the OJP. Fortunately, 44 Ma volcanism at Malaita Island, located on the southern margin of the OJP, has a location, age, and geochemistry consistent with a Samoan plume origin, and provides a “missing link” bridging the younger and older segments of the Samoan hotspot. Our synthesis of geochemical, geochronological, and plate motion model evidence reveals that Samoa exhibits a clear hotspot age progression for over 100 Myr.

10.1021/acs.est.4c04738,Carbon Abatement and Leakage in China’s Regional Carbon Emission Trading,"Emission trading schemes (ETS) are increasingly becoming a popular policy instrument to balance carbon abatement and economic growth. As a globally unified carbon pricing system has not yet been established, whether regionally operated ETSs cause carbon leakage remains a major concern. Taking China’s regional pilot ETSs as a quasi-natural experiment, the study uses the spatial difference-in-differences method to examine how regional ETSs affect carbon emissions in and outside cities of policy implementation. Our analysis finds that China’s regional ETS policy contributes to a 6.1% reduction in urban CO2 emissions and a 6.6% decline in emissions intensity in regulated cities, causing carbon leakages that increase CO2 emissions in neighboring cities by 1.7% on average. Our finding further suggests that regional ETSs mitigate local CO2 emissions through outsourcing production, improving energy efficiency and decarbonizing energy structure, whereas the outsourcing of industrial production drives up CO2 emissions in adjacent cities. Moreover, the performances of regional ETSs vary largely by socioeconomic context and mechanism design. China’s regional ETSs reduce CO2 emissions more effectively in central and industrial cities but with more severe carbon leakage, while rigorous compliance mechanisms and active market trading help deepen carbon abatement and alleviate carbon leakage.",Jingjing Jiang;Bin Ye;Zhenzhong Zeng;Xin Yang;Zhuoluo Sun;Shuai Shao;Kuishuang Feng;Xiujie Tan,Environmental Science & Technology,FALSE,[],本文主要研究中国区域碳排放交易机制对城市和周边地区碳排放的影响，采用空间差分法来分析区域碳排放交易机制对碳排放的影响。研究发现，中国区域碳排放交易机制能够有效降低参与城市的碳排放，但也可能导致碳泄漏，即碳排放转移到周边城市。研究还分析了不同区域、不同机制设计对碳减排和碳泄漏的影响。总体来说，该研究主要关注碳排放交易机制的经济和环境影响，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。
10.1021/acs.est.4c02212,Vertical Flux of Microplastics in the Deep Subtropical Pacific Ocean: Moored Sediment-Trap Observations within the Kuroshio Extension Recirculation Gyre,"The Kuroshio Extension recirculation gyre in the western North Pacific is an accumulation site of plastic litter transported by the Kuroshio Current. A sediment trap was moored at a depth of 4900 m at Station KEO within the Kuroshio Extension recirculation gyre, and the vertical flux of microplastics in sinking particles of size <1 mm was observed. Forty-one sediment-trap samples collected from July 1, 2014, to October 2, 2016, were analyzed with a micro-Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and microplastics were detected in all samples. Seventeen polymer types were identified, and 90% of the microplastics were less than 100 μm in size. Microplastic sinking was driven by the action of the biological pump, which was in turn driven by seasonal variations in solar radiation and increased surface primary production typical of the spring season. Microplastic mass flux varied from 4.5 × 10–3 to 0.38 mg m–2 day–1 during the sampling period, with a mean and standard deviation of 0.054 ± 0.075 mg m–2 day–1.

10.1021/acs.est.4c02949,Electrochemical Acid–Base Transport Limitation Principle for Low Electroactive Analyte Sensing in Wastewater Monitoring,"Electrochemical sensing (ES) is crucial for improving data acquisition in wastewater treatment, but obtaining the signal for a low electroactive analyte is challenging. Here, we propose an electrochemical acid–base transport limitation (eABTL) principle for inertness-based sensing, offering a new insight into generating ES signals from an interfacial transport process rather than electron transfer. This principle enables potential ES application for various weak acids and bases (WABs) without reactions themselves. We established an eABTLP method for detecting orthophosphate in solutions as a proof of concept, demonstrating commendable accuracy and precision, and a wide detection range from 10 μM to over 300 mM. Endogenous interferences were identified using 23 weak acids, indicating no significant endogenous interfering factors in typical wastewaters. Of them, volatile fatty acids are the main interference, but their effect can be eliminated by adjusting pH above 6.0. Exogenous factors like anions, cations, ion strength, temperature, organic load, and dissolved oxygen were examined, and most of their effects can be ignored by maintaining consistent analytical procedures between calibration curve and sample. Furthermore, measurement of wastewater samples confirmed the applicability toward domestic wastewater and demonstrated its wide applicability when combined with digestion pretreatment. Given the merits of inertness-based sensing, the eABTL-based methods have the potential to be a crucial part of ES techniques for environmental and industrial monitoring.",Fengjun Yin;Shuangshuang Liu;Xiaohui Yang;Shun Lu;Ying Zhao;Lin Chang;Zhaoming Chen;Hong Liu,Environmental Science & Technology,FALSE,[],该论文主要关注的是电化学传感技术在废水监测中的应用，提出了基于电化学酸碱传输限制原理的传感方法，用于检测低电活性分析物，例如正磷酸盐。该方法通过测量界面传输过程而不是电子转移来产生信号，并展现出良好的准确性和精度。论文重点在于该方法在废水监测中的应用，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。
10.1021/acs.est.4c04568,Oxidation of Ammonia in Water Microdroplets Produces Nitrate and Molecular Hydrogen,"Water microdroplets containing dissolved ammonia (30–300 μM) are sprayed through a copper oxide mesh with a 200 μm average pore size, resulting in the formation of nitrate (NO3–) and the release of molecular hydrogen (H2). The products result from a redox process that takes place at the liquid–solid interface through contact electrification, where no external potential is applied. Oxidation is initiated by superoxide radical anions (O2–) that originate from the oxygen in the air surrounding the microdroplets and from the hydroxyl radicals (OH•) originating from the water–air interface. Two spin traps (TEMPO and DMPO) capture these radicals as well as NH2OH+•, HNO, NO•, NO2•, and NOOH, which are detected by mass spectrometry. We also directly observed N2O2–• by the same means. We found that the hydrogen atom from the ammonia molecule can be set free not only in the form of H• but also as H2, which is detected using a residue gas analyzer. The oxidation process can be significantly enhanced by a factor of 3 when the sprayed microdroplets are irradiated with ultraviolet light (265 nm, 5 W). 35% of 300 μM ammonia can be degraded within 20 μs, and the nitrate conversion rate is estimated to be 15 nmol·mg–1·h–1.",Xiaowei Song;Chanbasha Basheer;Yu Xia;Richard N.

10.1021/acs.est.4c04637,Cyanohydrin Equilibria Implicate Non-Aromatic Aldehydes in Photochemical Production of Oceanic Carbon Monoxide,"Carbonyls have previously been dismissed as significant precursors for carbon monoxide (CO) photoproduction from natural chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Here, we used hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which reacts with carbonyls to form photochemically inert cyanohydrins, as a probe to re-examine the role of carbonyls in CO photoproduction. Adding HCN to low-absorbance euphotic zone seawater decreased CO photoproduction. Modeling [HCN] (∼5 to 364 μM) vs the percent decrease in CO photoproduction (%CO↓) yielded carbonyl-cyanohydrin dissociation equilibrium constants, KD, and maximum %CO↓, %CO↓max values. Four Atlantic and Pacific seawater KDs (66.7 ± 19.6 μM) overlap aqueous aliphatic but not aromatic aldehyde KDs. Phenylacetaldehyde (PA) and other β,γ-unsaturated aldehydes are proposed as prototypical CO precursors. Direct photolysis of ∼10 nM PA can supply the measured daily production of HCN-sensitive CO at an open-ocean site near Bermuda. HCN’s %CO↓max was 31 ± 2.5% in North Atlantic seawater vs the 13 ± 2.5% inhibition of CO photoproduction by borohydride, a dilemma since only borohydride affects most ketones. Borohydride also decreased CDOM absorption much more than did HCN. This puzzle probably reflects differing steric and solvation requirements in HCN- and borohydride-CDOM reactions. This study demonstrates cyanophilic aldehydes to be a significant source of open-ocean CO and reveals new clues regarding CDOM photochemistry mechanisms.",Oliver C. Zafiriou;Huixiang Xie;David J.

10.1021/acs.est.4c05646,Identification of Emerging Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in E-waste Recycling Practices and New Precursors for Trifluoroacetic Acid,"Electronic waste is an emerging source of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) emissions to the environment, yet the contribution from hazardous recycling practices in the South Asian region remains unclear. This study detected 41 PFAS in soil samples from e-waste recycling sites in Pakistan and the total concentrations were 7.43–367 ng/g dry weight (dw) (median: 37.7 ng/g dw). Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid emerged as the dominant PFAS, constituting 49% and 13% of the total PFAS concentrations, respectively. Notably, nine CF3-containing emerging PFAS were identified by the high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based screening. Specifically, hexafluoroisopropanol and bistriflimide (NTf2) were consistently identified across all the samples, with quantified concentrations reaching up to 854 and 90 ng/g dw, respectively. This suggests their potential association with electronic manufacturing and recycling processes. Furthermore, except for NTf2, all the identified emerging PFAS were confirmed as precursors of TFA with molar yields of 8.87–40.0% by the TOP assay validation in Milli-Q water. Overall, this study reveals significant emission of PFAS from hazardous e-waste recycling practices and emphasizes the identification of emerging sources of TFA from precursor transformation, which are essential for PFAS risk assessment.",Mujtaba Baqar;Maosen Zhao;Rimsha Saleem;Zhipeng Cheng;Bo Fang;Xiaoyu Dong;Hao Chen;Yiming Yao;Hongwen Sun,Environmental Science & Technology,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注电子废弃物回收过程中产生的全氟烷基和多氟烷基物质（PFAS），特别是三氟乙酸（TFA）的前体物质。研究地点位于巴基斯坦，使用了土壤样品分析方法，并未涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。
10.1021/acs.est.3c09927,Perinatal Exposure to Phenols and Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Gut Microbiota in One-Year-Old Children,"The role of the gut microbiota in human health calls for a better understanding of its determinants. In particular, the possible effects of chemicals with widespread exposure other than pharmaceuticals are little known. Our aim was to characterize the sensitivity of the early-life gut microbiota to specific chemicals with possible antimicrobial action. Within the SEPAGES French couple-child cohort, we assessed 12 phenols in repeated urine samples from 356 pregnant women and their offspring and 19 poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in serum from the pregnant women. We collected stool samples from the children at one year of age, in which the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced, allowing for gut bacterial profiling. Associations of each chemical with α- and β-diversity indices of the gut microbiota and with the relative abundance of the most abundant taxa were assessed using single-pollutant and mixture (BKMR) models. Perinatal exposure to certain parabens was associated with gut microbiota α- and β-diversity and with Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Suggestive associations of certain phenols with genera of the Lachnospiraceae and Enterobacteriaceae families were observed, but these were not maintained after correction for multiple testing.

10.1021/acs.est.4c00082,"Transitioning Toward a Zero-Emission Electricity Sector in a Net-Zero Pathway for Africa Delivers Contrasting Energy, Economic and Sustainability Synergies Across the Region","Although Africa contributes less than 5% to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, its role in global climate action is pivotal. To date, 53 African countries have submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and four have committed to a net-zero target. However, many of Africa’s NDCs are vaguely expressed and without specific focus on explicit sectoral decarbonization targets. Furthermore, Africa’s huge land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) potential remains unclear in the context of enabling net-zero emissions within the continent. This study achieves two objectives: Under a NZ GHG emission trajectory in Africa, we uncover the implications of a targeted zero-emission electricity sector by 2030, on the energy landscape and other sustainability factors.  This study also features the role of land-based biological removal methods─bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation/reforestation (A/R)─in net zero actualization in Africa. Our results reveal a unified but disparate actualisation of the mid-century net zero emission goal across the continent, as all regions except North Africa achieve carbon neutrality. The industrial sector  faces significant difficulties in transitioning and contributes  substantially to positive emissions on the continent, with its share of total residual emissions reaching 49–64% by 2050. This difficulty persists even with targeted sectoral decarbonization of the electricity sector, although it is significantly reduced by the availability of BECCS as a CDR option. Under thezero-emission electricity pathway, emissions in buildings and transport sectors are reduced due to rapid electrification. A trade-off emerges in the net zero pathway concerning land allocation for negative emissions versus other land use activities. A key result shows that achieving a net zero target in Africa leads to a cumulative loss of $102 billion in fossil fuel infrastructure within the electricity sector by mid-century, which doubles when the zero-emission electricity goal is achieved.",Humphrey Adun;Jeffrey Dankwa Ampah;Mustafa Dagbasi,Environmental Science & Technology,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要关注非洲实现净零排放目标的路径，重点研究了电力行业脱碳对能源、经济和可持续发展的影响，以及生物碳捕获和封存（BECCS）和造林/再造林（A/R）在实现净零排放中的作用。论文没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。
10.1021/acs.est.4c00223,Exploring Synergistic GHG Emissions Mitigation Potential and Costs of Room Air Conditioners,"This study explores the potential of synergistically reducing direct (refrigerant) and indirect (electricity) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the global room air conditioning (RAC) sector, based on 80% of global RAC manufactured in China. Three scenarios are evaluated: Business-as-usual (BAU) based on maintaining refrigerant and energy efficiency levels from 2021 China RAC sales shares, Kigali Amendment compliant with 10% energy efficiency improvement by 2025 (KAE), and accelerated refrigerant transition and energy efficiency improvement (ATE). Each scenario considers the costs of refrigerant and efficiency measures for export market groups based on Kigali Amendment classifications. BAU predicts around 1 Gt CO2-eq average annual global RAC emissions (2022–2060). Cumulative emission reductions in China’s RAC manufacturing under KAE and ATE are 12.2 and 17.2 Gt CO2-eq A5II and A5I (except China), presenting cost-effective abatement measures, with average costs of -$51.4 and -$68.8/t CO2-eq in KAE and ATE. Cumulative average abatement costs are around $18 and $4/t CO2-eq globally. KAE and ATE scenarios would avoid surface temperature rises of 0.023 (±0.002) °C and 0.027 (±0.003) °C, respectively, versus BAU.

It has been proposed to be listed in Annex A of the Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2023. Although MCCPs are a crucial health concern, their toxicity remains unclear. This study investigated the toxic effects of MCCPs (0.1–50 mg/kg body weight/day) on the thyroid gland of female Sprague–Dawley rats and characterized the potential toxic pathways via transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches. MCCPs exposure caused histopathological changes to the endoplasmic reticula and mitochondria in thyroid follicular cells at a dose of 50 mg/kg bw/d and increased serum thyrotropin-releasing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormones, and thyroxine when exposed to a higher dose of MCCPs. Transcriptomic analysis indicated the excessive expression of key genes related to thyroid hormone synthesis induced by MCCPs. Integrating the dual-omics analysis revealed mitochondrial dysfunction of the thyroid by mediating fatty acid oxidation, Kreb’s cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Significant metabolic toxicity on the thyroid might be linked to the characteristics of the chlorine content of MCCPs.

However, we know little about their ability to nucleate ice and their impact on ice formation in clouds. Ice nucleation by microplastics could also limit their long-range transport and global distribution. The present study explores the heterogeneous ice-nucleating ability of seven microplastic samples in immersion freezing mode. Two polypropylene samples and one polyethylene terephthalate sample froze heterogeneously with median freezing temperatures of −20.9, −23.2, and −21.9 °C, respectively. The number of ice nucleation sites per surface area, ns(T), ranged from 10–1 to 104 cm–2 in a temperature interval of −15 to −25 °C, which is comparable to that of volcanic ash and fungal spores. After exposure to ozone or a combination of UV light and ozone, simulating atmospheric aging, the ice nucleation activity decreased in some cases and remained unchanged in others.

10.1021/acs.est.4c03123,"Foliar Exposure of Deuterium Stable Isotope-Labeled Nanoplastics to Lettuce: Quantitative Determination of Foliar Uptake, Transport, and Trophic Transfer in a Terrestrial Food Chain","Nanoplastics (NPs) are widely detected in the atmosphere and are likely to be deposited on plant leaves. However, our understanding of their foliar uptake, translocation, and trophic transfer profiles is limited due to a lack of quantitative analytical tools to effectively probe mechanisms of action. Here, using synthesized deuterium (2H) stable isotope-labeled polystyrene nanoplastics (2H-PSNPs), the foliar accumulation and translocation of NPs in lettuce and the dynamics of NP transfer along a lettuce–snail terrestrial food chain were investigated. Raman imaging and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that foliar-applied NPs aggregated on the leaf surface, entered the mesophyll tissue via the stomatal pathway, and eventually translocated to root tissues. Quantitative analysis showed that increasing levels of foliar exposure to 2H-PSNPs (0.1, 1, and 5 mg/L in spray solutions, equivalent to receiving 0.15, 1.5, and 7.5 μg/d of NPs per plant) enhanced NP accumulation in leaves, with concentrations ranging from 0.73 to 15.6 μg/g (dw), but only limited translocation (<5%) to roots. After feeding on 5 mg/L 2H-PSNP-contaminated lettuce leaves for 14 days, snails accumulated NPs at 0.33 to 10.7 μg/kg (dw), with an overall kinetic trophic transfer factor of 0.45, demonstrating trophic dilution in this food chain. The reduced ingestion rate of 3.18 mg/g/day in exposed snails compared to 6.43 mg/g/day can be attributed to the accumulation of 2H-PSNPs and elevated levels of chemical defense metabolites in the lettuce leaves, which decreased the palatability for snails and disrupted their digestive function.

10.1021/acs.est.4c04009,Characterization of the Bioavailability of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Farmland Soils and the Factors Impacting Their Translocation to Edible Plant Tissues,"In this study, various crops and farmland soils were collected from the Fen-Wei Plain, China, to investigate the bioavailability of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), their accumulation in edible plant tissues, and the factors impacting their accumulation. PFAS were frequently detected in all of the crops, with total concentrations ranging from 0.61 to 35.8 ng/g. The results of sequential extractions with water, basic methanol, and acidic methanol indicate that water extraction enables to characterize the bioavailability of PFAS in soil to edible plant tissues more accurately, especially for the shorter-chain homologues. The bioavailability of PFAS was remarkably enhanced in the rhizosphere (RS) soil, with the strongest effect observed for leafy vegetables. The water-extracted Σ16PFAS in RS soil was strongly correlated with the content of dissolved organic carbon in the soil. Tannins and lignin, identified as the main components of plant root exudates by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, were found to enhance the bioavailability of PFAS significantly. Redundancy analysis provided strong evidence that the lipid and protein contents in edible plant tissues play important roles in the accumulation of short- and long-chain PFAS, respectively. Additionally, the high water demand of these tissues during the growth stage greatly facilitated the translocation of PFAS, particularly for the short-chain homologues and perfluorooctanoic acid.",Lina Shen;Jian Zhou;Yujing Ma;Qian Su;Heshun Mao;Eryuan Su;Kuok Ho Daniel Tang;Tiecheng Wang;Lingyan Zhu,Environmental Science & Technology,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注的是农田土壤中全氟烷基物质（PFAS）的生物有效性及其在可食用植物组织中的积累，研究方法包括土壤和植物样品的采集分析，以及对影响PFAS生物有效性和积累的因素进行研究。研究内容与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，主要涉及土壤环境和农作物安全领域。

This could be a concern for human and environmental health if it results in the enhanced bioaccumulation of monomethylmercury (MMHg). Here, we explore how upwelling influences Hg cycling in the California Current System (CCS) biome through particle scavenging and sea-air exchange. We collected suspended and sinking particle samples from a coastal upwelled water parcel and an offshore non-upwelled water parcel and observed higher total particulate Hg and sinking flux in the upwelling region compared to open ocean. To further investigate the full dynamics of Hg cycling, we modeled Hg inventories and fluxes in the upper ocean under upwelling and non-upwelling scenarios. The model simulations confirmed and quantified that upwelling enhances sinking fluxes of Hg by 41% through elevated primary production. Such an enhanced sinking flux of Hg is biogeochemically important to understand in upwelling regions, as it increases the delivery of Hg to the deep ocean where net conversion to MMHg may take place.",Xinyun Cui;Hannah M.

10.1021/acs.est.4c04487,Intrinsic Peroxidase-like Activity of Polystyrene Nanoplastics Mediates Oxidative Stress,"Nanoplastics represent a global environmental concern due to their ubiquitous presence and potential adverse impacts on public and environmental health. There is a growing need to advance the mechanistic understanding of their reactivity as they interact with biological and environmental systems. Herein, for the first time, we report that polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) have intrinsic peroxidase-like activity and are able to mediate oxidative stress. The peroxidase-like activity is dependent on temperature and pH, with a maximum at pH 4.5 and 40 °C. The catalytic activity exhibits saturation kinetics, as described by the Michaelis–Menten model. The peroxidase-like activity of PSNPs is attributed to their ability to mediate electron transfer from peroxidase substrates to H2O2. Ozone-induced PSNP aging can introduce oxygen-containing groups and disrupt aromatic structures on the nanoplastic surface. While ozonation initially enhances peroxidase-like activity by increasing oxygen-containing groups without degrading many aromatic structures, extended ozonation destroys aromatic structures, significantly reducing this activity. The peroxidase-like activity of PSNPs can mediate oxidative stress, which is generally positively correlated with their aromatic structures, as suggested by the ascorbic acid assay. These results help explain the reported oxidative stress exerted by nanoplastics and provide novel insights into their environmental and public health implications.",Yi Tan;Siyue Chen;Mengjiao Wang;Heyun Fu;Pedro J.

10.1021/acs.est.4c04533,Enhancement of Mineralization Ability and Water Resistance of Vanadium-Based Catalysts for Catalytic Oxidation of Chlorobenzene by Platinum Loading,"The design of a catalyst with multifunctional sites is one of the effective methods for low-temperature catalytic oxidation of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs). The loss of redox sites and competitive adsorption of H2O prevalent in the treatment of industrial exhaust gases are the main reasons for the weak mineralization ability and poor water vapor resistance of V-based catalysts. In this work, platinum (Pt) is selected to combine with the V/CeO2 catalyst, which provides more redox sites and H2O dissociative activation sites and further enhances its catalytic performance. The results show that PtV/CeO2 achieves 90% of the CO2 yield at 318 °C and maintains excellent catalytic activity rather than continuous deactivation within 15 h after water vapor injection. The formation of Pt–O–V bonds enhances the redox ability and promotes deep oxidation of polychlorinated intermediates, accounting for the significantly improved mineralization ability of PtV/CeO2.

10.1021/acs.est.4c04743,Exploring Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Presence and Potential Leaching from Reverse Osmosis Membranes: Implications for Drinking Water Treatment,"Reverse osmosis (RO) is increasingly used in drinking water production to effectively remove micropollutants, such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). However, RO membranes themselves may contain PFAS, which can potentially leach into treated drinking water. Leaching experiments and direct total oxidizable precursor assays revealed the presence and leaching potential of PFOS (branched and linear), PFBA, PFHxA, PFNA, and PFOA in five selected commercial RO membranes. This resulted in the release of tens of milligrams of ΣPFAS per membrane element used in drinking water production. Depending on assumptions made regarding leaching kinetics and volume of produced water per membrane element, predicted concentrations of ΣPFAS in the produced water ranged from less than one up to hundreds of pg/L. These concentrations are two to four orders of magnitude lower than those currently observed in Dutch drinking waters. The origin of PFAS in the membranes remains unclear. Further research is needed to bridge the gap between the laboratory conditions as used in this study and the real-world conditions and for a full understanding of potential leaching scenarios.

The workflow includes blank subtraction, internal standard normalization, prediction of chemical uses in products, and feature annotation using multiple library search metrics and metadata from PubChem, among other functionalities. The workflow was developed and validated against 104 analytes identified by targeted analytical results in previously published reports of wristbands. A true positive rate of 62 and 48% in a quality control matrix and wristband samples, respectively, was observed for our optimum set of parameters.

10.1021/acs.est.4c06222,Impact of Water Saturation on the Fate and Mobility of Antibiotics in Reactive Porous Geomedia,"Understanding contaminant transport through unsaturated porous media is a considerable challenge, given the complex interplay of nonlinear physical and biogeochemical processes driven by variations in water saturation. In this study, we tackled this challenge through a series of column experiments involving fine (100–300 μm) and coarse (1.0–1.4 mm) sand particles coated with birnessite (MnO2) under variable saturation degrees. Dynamic flow experiments in sand columns revealed that desaturation altered the ability of MnO2 in removing tetracycline (TTC), a redox-active antibiotic, yet the effect depends on the sand type and then on the saturation degree. Moderate saturation degrees in fine-grained sand columns promoted fractional and preferential water flow which favored a more acidic pH and increased dissolved oxygen levels. These conditions enhanced TTC removal, despite the reduced physical accessibility of reactive phases. In contrast, lower saturation degrees in coarse-grained sand columns induced stronger flow heterogeneity with a very small fraction of the water content participating in flow. The mobility behavior of all the columns was predicted using transport models that consider TTC adsorption and transformation, as well as dual porosity under variable water saturation degrees.

10.1021/acs.est.4c07510,The Hidden Role of the Dielectric Effect in Nanofiltration: A Novel Perspective to Unravel New Ion Separation Mechanisms,"Nanofiltration (NF) membranes play a critical role in separation processes, necessitating an in-depth understanding of their selective mechanisms. Existing NF models predominantly include steric and Donnan mechanisms as primary mechanisms. However, these models often fail in elucidating the NF selectivity between ions of similar dimensions and the same valence. To address this gap, an innovative methodology was proposed to unravel new selective mechanisms by quantifying the nominal dielectric effect isolated from steric and Donnan exclusion through fitted pore dielectric constants by regression analysis. We demonstrated that the nominal dielectric effect encompassed unidentified selective mechanisms of significant relevance by establishing the correlation between the fitted pore dielectric constants and these hindrance factors. Our findings revealed that dehydration-induced ion–membrane interaction, rather than ion dehydration, played a pivotal role in ion partitioning within NF membranes. This interaction was closely linked to the nondeformable fraction of hydrated ions. Further delineation of the dielectric effect showed that favorable interactions between ions and membrane functional groups contributed to entropy-driven selectivity, which is a key factor in explaining ion selectivity differences between ions sharing the same size and valence.

10.1021/acs.est.4c00380,U.S. Ethane Emissions and Trends Estimated from Atmospheric Observations,"Oil and natural gas (O&G) production and processing activities have changed markedly across the U.S. over the past several years. However, the impacts of these changes on air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are not clear. In this study, we examine U.S. ethane (C2H6) emissions, which are primarily from O&G activities, during years 2015–2020. We use C2H6 observations made by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory and partner organizations from towers and aircraft and estimate emissions from these observations by using an inverse model. We find that U.S. C2H6 emissions (4.43 ± 0.2 Tg·yr–1) are approximately three times those estimated by the EPA’s 2017 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) platform (1.54 Tg·yr–1) and exhibit a very different seasonal cycle. We also find that changes in U.S. C2H6 emissions are decoupled from reported changes in production; emissions increased 6.3 ± 7.6% (0.25 ± 0.31 Tg) between 2015 and 2020 while reported C2H6 production increased by a much larger amount (78%).

10.1021/acs.est.4c03187,COPD-Like Phenotypes in TBC-Treated Mice Can be Effectively Alleviated via Estrogen Supplement,"Tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) isocyanurate (TBC), recognized as an endocrine disruptor, can cause inflammatory injury to the lung tissue of mice. To investigate the specific respiratory effects of TBC, male C57BL/6J mice were administered a daily dose of 20 mg/kg of TBC over 14 days. Postexposure, these mice developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-like symptoms characterized by inflammatory lung damage and functional impairment. In light of the antiestrogenic properties of TBC, we administrated estradiol (E2) to investigate its potential protective role against TBC-induced damage and found that the coexposure of E2 notably mitigated the COPD-like phenotypes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TBC exposure reduced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression and increased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) expression, while E2 treatment rebalanced the expression levels of ERα and NF-κB to their normative states. Our findings indicate that TBC, as an antiestrogenic agent, may contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD through an ERα-mediated inflammatory pathway, but that E2 treatment could reverse the impairment, providing a potentially promising remedial treatment. Given the lung status as a primary target of air pollution, the presence of antiestrogenic compounds like TBC in atmospheric particulates presents a significant concern, with the potential to exacerbate respiratory conditions such as COPD and pneumonia.",Wenjuan Zhang;Yuxin Wang;Ling Wang;Mengxi Cao;Huiming Cao;Maoyong Song;Yun Qian;Thanh Wang;Yong Liang;Guibin Jiang,Environmental Science & Technology,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注三溴代异氰尿酸酯 (TBC) 对小鼠肺部造成的影响，发现它会导致类似慢性阻塞性肺疾病 (COPD) 的症状，并探讨了雌激素 (E2) 对 TBC 诱导的肺损伤的保护作用。研究表明，TBC 作为抗雌激素剂，可能通过 ERα 介导的炎症通路导致 COPD 的发生，而 E2 治疗可以逆转这种损伤。该研究主要集中在 TBC 作为一种内分泌干扰物对肺部的毒性作用，以及雌激素对这种毒性的缓解作用，与大气环境遥感技术如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析关系不大。
10.1021/acs.est.4c03870,A Potential Neurotoxic Mechanism: Bisphenol S-Induced Inhibition of Glucose Transporter 1 Leads to ATP Excitotoxicity in the Zebrafish Brain,"Many environmental pollutants have neurotoxic effects, but the initial molecular events involved in these effects are unclear. Here, zebrafish were exposed to the neurotoxicant bisphenol S (BPS, 1, 10, or 100 μg/L) from the embryonic stage to the larval stage to explore the ability of BPS to interfere with energy metabolism in the brain. BPS, which is similar to a glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) inhibitor, inhibited GLUT1 function but increased mitochondrial activity in the brains of larval zebrafish. Interestingly, GLUT1 inhibitor treatment and BPS exposure did not reduce energy production in the brain; instead, they increased ATP production by inducing the preferential use of ketone bodies. Moreover, BPS promoted the protein expression of the purinergic 2X receptor but inhibited the purinergic 2Y-mediated phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, indicating that excess ATP acts as a neurotransmitter to activate the purinergic 2X receptor under the BPS-induced restriction of GLUT1 function. BPS-induced inhibition of GLUT1 increased the number of neurons but promoted apoptosis by activating ATP-purinergic 2X receptors in the brain, causing ATP excitatory neurotoxicity.

Here, 24 targeted PFAS in seawater, sediments, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and plankton in the offshore region adjacent to this estuary were investigated. The three dominant PFAS in all phases were perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, 23.8–61.9%), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA, 23.6–42.8%), and perfluoro(2-methyl-3-oxahexanoic) acid (HFPO-DA, 6.1–12.1%), and perfluoro-1-butane sulfonamide (FBSA, 0.1–7.3%) was first detected. The horizontal distributions of PFAS were dependent on salinity and disturbed by multiple water masses, while the vertical variations could be explained by their different partitioning characteristics in the water-SPM-sediment system (partition coefficients, Log Kd and Log Koc) and plankton (bioaccumulation factors, Log BAF). Although physical mixing was the major driver for PFAS settling (>83.7%), the absolute settling amount caused by the biological pump was still high (150.00–41994.65 ng m–2 day–1). More importantly, we found unexpected high Log Kd values of PFBA (2.24–4.55) and HFPO-DA (2.26–4.67), equal to PFOA (2.28–4.72), which brought concerns about their environmental persistence.

Understanding the fates of aryl-PFRs in vivo is crucial to assessing their toxicity and the risks they pose. Seven TPHP metabolites, including Phase I hydrolysis and hydroxylation and Phase II glucuronidation products, were identified in C57BL/6J male mice following subacute dietary exposure to aryl-PFRs (70 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day) for 7 days. TPHP was almost completely metabolized by mice (∼97%), with DPHP the major metabolite formed (34%–58%). In addition, mice were exposed to aryl-PFRs (7 μg/kg bw/day) for 12 weeks. Both TPHP and DPHP occurred at higher concentrations in the digestive tract (intestine and stomach), liver and heart. The total concentration of DPHP in all organs was 3.55-fold greater than that of TPHP. Recovery analysis showed that the rate of TPHP elimination from mouse organs reached 38%, while only 3%–5% of DPHP was removed, suggesting that the rates of degradation and elimination of DPHP were slower than TPHP and its bioaccumulation potential was higher.

We herein demonstrate more effective removal of 28 halogenated aromatic DBPs in the UV/H2O2 AOP at 222 nm (UV222) than in the conventional UV/H2O2 AOP at 254 nm. Direct photolysis of 28 halogenated aromatic DBPs was greatly enhanced at 222 nm with fluence-based photodecay rate constants of 4.31 × 10–4–1.53 × 10–2 cm2 mJ–1, which was mainly attributed to the higher molar absorption coefficients of halogenated aromatic DBPs at 222 nm than 254 nm. Generally, quantum yields of halogenated aromatic DBPs at both 222  and 254 nm followed the order of halophenols > halohydroxybenzaldehydes > halonitrophenols.

Thereafter, the relative concentration–cytotoxicity contribution of each HHBN was calculated based on the acquired occurrence level and cytotoxicity data in this study, the genome-scale cytotoxicity mechanism was explored, and a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model was developed. Results indicated that new monoHHBNs were present in drinking water at concentrations of 0.04–1.83 ng/L and exhibited higher cytotoxicity than some other monohalogenated aromatic DBPs. Notably, monoHHBNs showed concentration–cytotoxicity contribution comparable to diHHBNs, which have been previously identified as potential toxicity drivers in drinking water.

Employing maize, wheat, pea, and water spinach, we conducted a thorough investigation utilizing a multispecies, multiparameter, and multitechnique approach to assess the pollution characteristics and ecotoxicological effects of lithium. The findings suggested that lithium might persist in an amorphous state, altering surface functional groups and chemical bonds, although semiquantitative analysis was unattainable. Notably, lithium demonstrated high mobility, with a mild acid-soluble fraction accounting for 29.66–97.02% of the total, while a minor quantity of exogenous lithium tended to be a residual fraction. Plant analysis revealed that in 10–80 mg Li/kg soils lithium significantly enhanced certain growth parameters of maize and pea, and the calculated LC50 values for aerial part length across the four plant species varied from 173.58 to 315.63 mg Li/kg.

However, accurately measuring the fine-mode aerosol optical depth (fAOD) is highly uncertain in most existing satellite-based aerosol products. Deep learning offers promise for inferring fAOD, but little has been done using multiangle satellite data. We developed an innovative angle-dependent deep-learning model (ADLM) that accounts for angular diversity in dual-angle observations. The model captures aerosol properties observed from dual angles in the contiguous United States and explores the potential of Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite-2’s (GOSAT-2) measurements to retrieve fAOD at a 460 m spatial resolution. The ADLM demonstrates a strong performance through rigorous validation against ground-based data, revealing small biases. By comparison, the official fAOD product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) during wildfire events is underestimated by more than 40% over western USA.

10.1021/acs.est.4c02593,Dissolved Organic Matter Contains Ketones Across a Wide Range of Molecular Formulas,"The carbonyl functionality of natural organic matter (NOM) is poorly constrained. Here, we treated Suwannee River NOM (SRNOM) with ammonium acetate and sodium cyanoborohydride to convert ketone-containing compounds by reductive amination to their corresponding primary amines. The total dissolved nitrogen content increased by up to 275% after amination. Up to 30% of the molecular formulas of SRNOM contained isomers with ketone functionalities as detected by ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Most of these isomers contained one or two keto groups. At least 3.5% of the oxygen in SRNOM was bound in ketone moieties. The conversion of reacted compounds increased linearly with O/H values of molecular formulas and was predictable from the elemental composition.

10.1021/acs.est.4c02803,Plutonium Speciation and Oxidation State Distributions in the Presence of Citrate,"We explored the speciation and kinetics of the Pu(VI)-citrate and Pu(III)-citrate systems (pHm = 2.5–11.0, I = 0.1 M NaCl, T = 23 °C, O2(g) < 2 ppm) using ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared (UV–vis–NIR) spectrophotometry, solvent extraction, and PHREEQC modeling. Formation constants were determined for PuO2(HcitH)(aq) (log K°1,1 = 1.09 ± 0.05) and PuO2(HcitH)(citH)3– (log K°1,2 = −0.20 ± 0.07), and evidence for (PuO2)m(citH–k)n(OH)x2m(3+k)n–x was identified under alkaline conditions. Pu(VI) species were found to be less stable in the presence of citrate than in the absence of citrate (t ≤ 168 days); the rate of reduction increased with increasing pH. The direct reduction of Pu(VI) to Pu(IV) was required to fit experimental data in the presence of citrate but did not improve the fit for Pu in the absence of citrate. We also observed increased Pu(III) stability in the presence of citrate (t ≤ 293 days), with higher concentrations of Pu(III) favored at lower pH. Finally, we provide evidence of a radiolysis-driven mechanism for the citrate-mediated reduction of plutonium that involves electron transfer from the oxidative breakdown of citrate.

10.1021/acs.est.4c04574,Reevaluating the Drivers of Fertilizer-Induced N2O Emission: Insights from Interpretable Machine Learning,"Direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from fertilizer application are the largest anthropogenic source of global N2O, but the factors influencing these emissions remain debated. Here, we compile 1134 observations of fertilizer-induced N2O emission factor (EF) from 229 publications, covering various regions and crops globally. We then employ an interpretable machine learning model to investigate the driving factors of fertilizer-induced N2O emissions. Our results reveal that pH, soil organic carbon, precipitation, and temperature are the most influential factors, overweighing the impacts of management practices. Nitrogen application rate has a positive impact on the EF, but the effect diminishes as nitrogen application rate increases, which has been overestimated in previous studies. Soil pH has three-stage influence on EF: positive when 7.3 ≤ pH ≤ 8.7, significantly negative between 6.8 and 7.3, and insignificant at lower pH levels (4.7 ≤ pH ≤ 6.8). Moreover, we confirm the nonlinear contributions of temperature and precipitation to EF, which may cause an unexpected increase in N2O emission under climate change.

10.1021/acs.est.4c04714,Discovery of an End-to-End Pattern for Contaminant-Oriented Advanced Oxidation Processes Catalyzed by Biochar with Explainable Machine Learning,"The utilization of biochar-catalyzed peroxymonosulfate in advanced oxidation processes (BC-PMS AOPs) is widely acknowledged as an effective and economical method for mitigating emerging contaminants (ECs). Especially, state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) technology has been employed to accurately predict the reaction rate constants of EC degradation in BC-PMS AOPs, primarily focusing on three aspects: performance prediction, operating condition optimization, and mechanism interpretation. However, its real application in specific degradation optimization targeting different ECs is seldom considered, hindering the realization of contaminant-oriented BC-PMS AOPs. Herein, we propose a hierarchical ML pipeline to achieve an end-to-end (E2E) pattern for addressing this issue. First, the overall XGB model, trained with the comprehensive data set, can perform well in predicting the reaction constants of EC degradation in BC-PMS AOPs, additionally providing the basis for further analysis of various ECs. Then, the submodels trained with different EC clusters can offer specific strategies for the selection of the optimum option for BC-PMS AOPs of specific ECs with different HOMO–LUMO gaps, thus forming an E2E operating pattern for BC-PMS AOPs. This study not only increases our understanding of contaminant-oriented optimization of AOPs but also successfully bridges the gap between ML model development and its environmental application.",Rupeng Wang;Honglin Chen;Zixiang He;Shiyu Zhang;Ke Wang;Nanqi Ren;Shih-Hsin Ho,Environmental Science & Technology,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注的是利用生物炭催化过氧单硫酸盐进行高级氧化工艺（BC-PMS AOPs）降解新兴污染物（ECs）的效率，并利用机器学习模型预测EC降解速率常数，优化操作条件，解释降解机理。研究中并没有涉及到大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。
10.1021/acs.est.4c05165,Nontargeted Analysis of Reactive Nitrogenous Compounds in Suwannee River Standard Reference Materials and Authentic River Water Samples,"Concerns over toxic nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs) necessitate identifying their precursors in source water. Natural organic amino compounds are known precursors to N-DBPs. Three Suwannee River (SR) standard reference materials (SRMs), humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and natural organic matter (NOM), are commonly used to study DBP formation, but the chemical makeup of amino compounds in SRSRMs remains largely unknown. To address this, we combined stable hydrogen/deuterium isotope labeling, HDPairFinder bioinformatics, and nontargeted high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) to characterize these compounds in SRSRMs. This method classifies reactive amines, provides accurate masses and MS/MS spectra, and quantifies intensities. We identified 2707 high-quality features with primary and/or secondary amines in SRSRMs and 75% of them having an m/z < 300. Across all three SRSRMs, 327 amino features were detected, while 856, 794, and 200 unique features were found in SRNOM, SRHA, and SRFA, respectively. In North Saskatchewan River (NSR) samples, a total of 6449 amino features were detected, 818 of them matched those in SRSRMs, and 87% of them were different between the two rivers.

10.1021/acs.est.4c05488,Sustainable Biomass Acts as an Electron Donor for Cr(VI) Reduction during the Subcritical Hydrothermal Process: Molecular Insights into the Role of Hydrochar and Liquid Compounds,"Heavy metal pollution is a critical environmental issue that has garnered significant attention from the international community. Subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) as an emerging green technology has demonstrated remarkable promise in environmental remediation. However, there is limited research on the remediation of highly toxic Cr(VI) using HTL. This study reveals that the HTL reaction of biomass enables the simultaneous reduction and precipitation of Cr(VI). At 280 °C, the reduction of Cr(VI) was nearly complete, with a high reduction rate of 98.9%. The reduced Cr as Cr(OH)3 and Cr2O3 was primarily enriched in hydrochar, accounting for over 99.9% of the total amount. This effective enrichment resulted in the removal of Cr(VI) from the aqueous phase while simultaneously yielding clean liquid compounds like organic acids and furfural. Furthermore, the elevated temperature facilitated the formation of Cr(III) and enhanced its accumulation within hydrochar. Notably, the resulting hydrochar and small oxygenated compounds, especially aldehyde, served as electron donors for Cr(VI) reduction. Additionally, the dissolved Cr facilitated the depolymerization and deoxygenation processes of macromolecular compounds with lignin-like structures, leading to more small oxygenated compounds and subsequently influencing Cr(VI) reduction.

10.1021/acs.est.4c06675,Deciphering the Formation of Fe(IV) in the Fe(II)/Peroxydisulfate Process: The Critical Role of Sulfate Radical,"This study delves into the formation of ferryl ions (Fe(IV)) within the Fe(II)/peroxydisulfate (PDS) process, a pivotal reaction in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) aimed at organic pollutant removal. Our findings challenge the conventional view that Fe(IV) predominantly forms through oxygen transfer from PDS to Fe(II), revealing that sulfate radicals (SO4•–) play a crucial role in Fe(IV) generation. By employing competitive kinetics, the second-order rate constant for Fe(III) oxidation by SO4•– was quantified as 4.58 × 108 M–1 s–1. Factors such as the probe compound concentration, chloride presence, and iron species influence Fe(IV) generation, all of which were systematically evaluated. Additionally, the study explores Fe(IV) formation in various Fe(II)-activated AOPs, demonstrating that precursors like peroxymonosulfate and H2O2 can also directly oxidize Fe(II) to Fe(IV). Through experimental data, kinetic modeling, and oxygen-18 labeling experiments, this research offers a comprehensive understanding of the Fe(II)/PDS system, facilitating the optimization of AOPs for pollutant degradation.

10.1021/acs.est.4c00704,Designing Retirement Strategies for Coal-Fired Power Plants To Mitigate Air Pollution and Health Impacts,"Retiring coal power plants can reduce air pollution and health damages. However, the spatial distribution of those impacts remains unclear due to complex power system operations and pollution chemistry and transport. Focusing on coal retirements in Pennsylvania (PA), we analyze six counterfactual scenarios for 2019 that differ in retirement targets (e.g., reducing 50% of coal-based installed capacity vs generation) and priorities (e.g., closing plants with higher cost, closer to Environmental Justice Areas, or with higher CO2 emissions). Using a power system model of the PJM Interconnection, we find that coal retirements in PA shift power generation across PA and Rest of PJM, leading to scenario-varying changes in the plant-level release of air pollutants. Considering pollution transport and the size of the exposed population, these emissions changes, in turn, give rise to a reduction of 6–136 PM2.5-attributable deaths in  PJM across the six scenarios, with most reductions occurring in PA. Among our designed scenarios, those that reduce more coal power generation yield greater aggregate health benefits due to air quality improvements in PA and adjacent downwind regions. In addition, comparing across the six scenarios evaluated in this study, vulnerable populations─in both PA and Rest of  PJM─benefit most in scenarios that prioritize plant closures near Environmental Justice Areas in PA. These results demonstrate the importance of considering cross-regional linkages and sociodemographics in designing equitable retirement strategies.",Carla Campos Morales;Emily L. Pakhtigian;Joel R.

This study utilized natural radionuclides 7Be, 210Pb, and 210Po to explore the transport of atmospheric microplastics in Tianjin, a coastal city in Northern China. Microplastic concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 0.13 particles m–3 over the course of a year. The proportion of microplastic fragments in winter was significantly higher than that in other seasons, with median microplastic sizes in autumn and winter being larger than those in spring and summer. The atmospheric microplastic surface was rough, exhibiting irregular pores and multiple depressions and cracks. Microplastics experienced vertical mixing with the upper atmosphere in April and August and were influenced by rainfall in July. The residence time of atmospheric particles ranged from 9.47 to 22.85 days throughout the year, with an average of 14.41 days. The peak residence time of atmospheric particulates in November may be correlated with increased 210Po levels from coal consumption.

10.1021/acs.est.4c02356,Imaging Dissolution Dynamics of Individual NaCl Nanoparticles during Deliquescence with In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy,"Water vapor condensation on hygroscopic aerosol particles plays an important role in cloud formation, climate change, secondary aerosol formation, and aerosol aging. Conventional understanding considers deliquescence of nanosized hygroscopic aerosol particles a nearly instantaneous solid to liquid phase transition. However, the nanoscale dynamics of water condensation and aerosol particle dissolution prior to and during deliquescence remain obscure due to a lack of high spatial and temporal resolution single particle measurements. Here we use real time in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of individual sodium chloride (NaCl) nanoparticles to demonstrate that water adsorption and aerosol particle dissolution prior to and during deliquescence is a multistep dynamic process. Water condensation and aerosol particle dissolution was investigated for lab generated NaCl aerosols and found to occur in three distinct stages as a function of increasing relative humidity (RH). First, a < 100 nm water layer adsorbed on the NaCl cubes and caused sharp corners to dissolve and truncate. The water layer grew to several hundred nanometers with increasing RH and was rapidly saturated with solute, as evidenced by halting of particle dissolution. Adjacent cube corners displayed second-scale curvature fluctuations with no net particle dissolution or water layer thickness change. We propose that droplet solute concentration fluctuations drove NaCl transport from regions of high local curvature to regions of low curvature. Finally, we observed coexistence of a liquid water droplet and aerosol particle immediately prior to deliquescence. Particles dissolved discretely along single crystallographic directions, separated by few second lag times with no dissolution. This work demonstrates that deliquescence of simple pure salt particles with sizes in the range of 100 nm to several microns is not an instantaneous phase transition and instead involves a range of complex dissolution and water condensation dynamics.",Yuhang Wang;Dewansh Rastogi;Kotiba A.

While the BRI’s environmental sustainability has raised concerns, the impacts of construction materials used in these projects have been overlooked, especially in developing countries. Here, we map and account for the materials embodied in the BRI by integrating, for the first time, official governmental project reports, geographical information, and material flow analysis. We pinpoint and analyze the BRI material stocks in each individual project by material types, countries, regions, and sectors. Between 2008 and 2023, 328 million tons of construction materials have accumulated in 540 BRI projects around the world, mostly in Asia and Africa.

10.1021/acs.est.4c02495,Transport Pathways of Nitrate in Stormwater Runoff Inferred from High-Frequency Sampling and Stable Water Isotopes,"Storm events can mobilize nitrogen species from landscapes into streams, exacerbating eutrophication and threatening aquatic ecosystems as well as human health. However, the transport pathways and storm responses of different nitrogen forms remain elusive. We used high-frequency chemical and isotopic sampling to partition sources of stormwater runoff and determine transport pathways of multiple nitrogen forms in an agricultural catchment. Bayesian mixing modeling reveals shallow subsurface water as the dominant source of stormwater runoff, contributing 74% of the water flux and 72, 71, and 79% of total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and nitrate (NO3-N), respectively. Groundwater, by contrast, contributed 11% of stormwater runoff and 21, 22, and 17% of TN, TDN, and NO3-N, respectively. The remaining 14% of stormwater runoff can be attributed to rainwater, which contains much less TN, TDN, and NO3-N. Surprisingly, during storm events, the dominant nitrogen form was NO3-N rather than dissolved organic nitrogen. Antecedent conditions and runoff characteristics have an important influence on nitrogen loads during storm events.

10.1021/acs.est.4c03053,Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid (PFHxS) Impairs Lipid Homeostasis in Zebrafish Larvae through Activation of PPARα,"Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), an emerging short-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance, has been frequently detected in aquatic environments. Adverse outcome pathway studies have shown that perfluorinated compounds impair lipid homeostasis through peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs). However, many of these studies were performed at high concentrations and may thus be a result of overt toxicity. To better characterize the molecular and key events of PFHxS to biota, early life-stage zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to concentrations detected in the environment (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L). Lipidomic and transcriptomic evaluations were integrated to predict potential molecular targets. PFHxS significantly impaired lipid homeostasis by the dysregulation of glycerophospholipids, fatty acyls, glycerolipids, sphingolipids, prenol lipids, and sterol lipids. Informatic analyses of the lipidome and transcriptome indicated alterations of the PPAR signaling pathway, with downstream changes to retinol, linoleic acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. To assess the role of PPARs, potential binding of PFHxS to PPARs was predicted and animals were coexposed to a PPAR antagonist (GW6471). Molecular simulation indicated PFHxS had a 27.1% better binding affinity than oleic acid, an endogenous agonist of PPARα. Antagonist coexposures rescued impaired glycerophosphocholine concentrations altered by PFHxS.

10.1021/acs.est.4c06110,Application of the Biological Toxicity Effect Ratio (BER) Method for Advancing Water Quality Criteria Derivation,"Water quality criteria (WQC) serve as a scientific foundation for pollutant risk assessment and control in aquatic ecosystems. The development of regionally differentiated WQC tailored to specific regional characteristics has become an emerging trend. However, the current WQC is constrained by a lack of regional species toxicity data. To address these limitations, this study proposes the biological toxicity effect ratio (BER) method, which indirectly reflects the toxicity sensitivity of the overall aquatic ecosystem through the toxicity information on a limited number of species, enabling rapid WQC prediction. Using the established WQC in China and the USA as a case study, we combined mathematical derivation and data validation to evaluate the BER method. Among various species-taxon groups of freshwater organisms, planktonic crustaceans demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy. Our analysis further revealed that species toxicity sensitivity and regional variability jointly influence the prediction accuracy. Regardless of the evaluation indexes, planktonic crustaceans emerged as the most suitable species-taxon group for the BER method. Additionally, the BER method is particularly applicable to pollutants with conserved mechanisms across species. This study systematically explores the feasibility of using the BER method and offers new insights for deriving regionally differentiated WQC.",Ren Ding;Yinhu Wu;Zitong Liao;Yun Lu;Dongbin Wei;Zhuo Chen;Hongying Hu,Environmental Science & Technology,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要关注水质标准的制定，利用生物毒性效应比 (BER) 方法来预测水生生物对污染物的敏感性，并根据有限的物种毒性数据推断整个水生生态系统的毒性敏感性。它与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析，没有直接关系。

Analysis of sediments from the Mussau (MS) and Mariana trench (MT) reveals notably high total CP concentrations (∑SCCPs + ∑MCCPs) of 10,963 and 14,554 ng g–1 dw, respectively, surpassing those in a reference site in the western Pacific abyssal plain (8533 ng g–1 dw). In contrast, the New Britain Trench (NBT) exhibits the lowest concentrations (2213–5880 ng g–1 dw), where CP distribution correlates with clay content, δ13C and δ15N values, but little with total organic carbon and depth. Additionally, amphipods from these trenches display varying CP levels, with MS amphipods reaching concerning concentrations (8681–16,138 ng g–1 lw), while amphipods in the MT-1 site show the lowest (4414–5010 ng g–1 lw). These bioaccumulation trends appear to be primarily influenced by feeding behaviors (δ13C) and trophic levels (δ15N). Utilizing biota-sediment accumulation factor values and principal component analysis, we discern that CPs in sediment may come from surface-derived particulate organic matters, while those in amphipods may come from the above carrion.

Humans inevitably ingest FLCMs via food and the environment. However, there are limited studies on internal exposure biomonitoring of FLCMs. Herein, we evaluated the estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of FLCMs in the general population based on serum residue levels. For the first time, 38 FLCMs were detected in 314 serum samples from the general population in Beijing, with a median value of 132.48 ng/g of lipid weight (lw). BDPrB is a predominant FLCM in serum. The median EDI of ∑38FLCMs in the general residents was 37.96 pg/kg bw/day. The residual levels of most FLCMs were higher in urban than in suburban areas (p < 0.05).

10.1021/acs.est.4c03205,Sex-Specific Effects of Environmental Exposure to the Antimicrobial Agents Benzalkonium Chloride and Triclosan on the Gut Microbiota and Health of Zebrafish (Danio rerio),"The use of disinfectants containing benzalkonium chloride (BAC) has become increasingly widespread in response to triclosan (TCS) restrictions and the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the increasing presence of BAC in aquatic ecosystems. However, the potential environmental health impacts of BAC on fish remain poorly explored. In this study, we show that BAC and TCS can induce the gut dysbiosis in zebrafish (Danio rerio), with substantial effects on health. Breeding pairs of adult zebrafish were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of BAC and TCS (0.4–40 μg/L) for 42 days. Both BAC and TCS exposure perturbed the gut microbiota, triggering the classical NF-κB signaling pathway and resulting in downstream pathological toxicity associated with inflammatory responses, histological damage, inhibited ingestion, and decreased survival. These effects were dose-dependent and sex-specific, as female zebrafish were more susceptible than male zebrafish. Furthermore, we found that BAC induced toxicity to a greater extent than the restricted TCS at environmentally relevant concentrations, which is particularly concerning. Our results suggest that environmental exposure to antimicrobial chemicals can have ecological consequences by perturbing the gut microbiota, a previously underappreciated target of such chemicals. Rigorous ecological analysis should be conducted before widely introducing replacement antimicrobial compounds into disinfecting products.",Yueyue Liu;Siyi Lin;Chen Wang;Tong Li;Guomao Zheng;Wen Sun;Lihui An;Yingchen Bai;Fengchang Wu,Environmental Science & Technology,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注的是抗菌剂对斑马鱼肠道菌群和健康的影响，研究方法是通过实验观察斑马鱼在暴露于抗菌剂后肠道菌群的变化以及健康状况的变化。研究与大气环境遥感技术没有直接关系，没有涉及到空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等方面。
10.1021/acs.est.4c05146,Health Impacts of Fine Particulate Matter Shift Due to Urbanization in China,"Rapid urbanization and industrialization have resulted in diverse anthropogenic activities and emissions between urban and non-urban regions, leading to varying levels of exposure to air pollutants and associated health risks. However, endeavors to mitigate air pollution and health benefits have displayed considerable heterogeneity across different regions. Therefore, comprehending the changes in air pollutant concentrations and health impacts within an urbanization context is imperative for promoting environmental equity. This paper uses gross domestic product (GDP)- and population-weighted methods to distinguish anthropogenic emissions from urban and non-urban areas in China and quantified their contributions to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model in 2010 and 2019. Anthropogenic emissions from urban and non-urban (outside urban) regions decreased by 26 and 44% from 2010 to 2019, respectively, resulting in 31 and 28% reductions of PM2.5 in China. PM2.5-related premature mortality attributed to non-urban and urban anthropogenic emission decreases by 8%. Non-urban anthropogenic activities are the main contributor to PM2.5 (56% in 2010 and 2019) and its associated premature mortality (59%), which also predominantly affects non-urban premature mortality (37–42% in 2010–2019). Population changes increase the proportion of premature mortality in urban populations (7–19%) from 2010 to 2019.

Here we identify key sources for co-control that prioritize the mitigation of PM2.5-related health burdens, given the homogeneous impacts of CO2 emissions from various sources. By applying an integrated analysis framework that consists of a detailed emission inventory, a chemical transport model, a multisource fused dataset, and epidemiological concentration–response functions, we systematically evaluate the contribution of emissions from 390 sources (30 provinces and 13 socioeconomic sectors) to PM2.5-related health impacts and CO2 emissions, as well as the marginal health benefits of CO2 abatement across China. The estimated source-specific contributions exhibit substantial disparities, with the marginal benefits varying by 3 orders of magnitude. The rural residential, transportation, metal, and power and heating sectors emerge as pivotal sources for co-control, with regard to their relatively large marginal benefits or the sectoral total benefits. In addition, populous and heavily industrialized provinces such as Shandong and Henan are identified as the key regions for co-control.

Herein, we explored the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the potential risks of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) on DSMs. At environmentally relevant concentrations, the conjugate transfer frequency (CTF) of ARGs increased by 1.34–2.37 folds by 20 μg/m3 of atmospheric water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs), and it increased by 2.62–2.86 folds by 80 ng/m3 of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Total suspended particulates (TSP) further promoted the CTF in combination with WSIIs or PAHs. Under WSII and PAH exposure, gene expression levels related to oxidative stress, cell membrane, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were upregulated. WSIIs predominantly induced cellular contact, while PAHs triggered ATP formation and membrane damage. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that WSIIs and PAHs reduced membrane lipid fluidity and increased membrane permeability through interactions with the phosphatidylcholine bilayer. DSM filtering performance decreased, and the CTF of ARGs increased with the wearing time. The gut simulator test showed that ARB disrupted the human gut microbial community and increased total ARG abundance but did not change the ARG abundance carried by ARB themselves.

10.1021/acs.est.4c01934,Multiple Roles of Anions on the Degradation Efficiency and Mineralization Pathway of Recalcitrant Acetaldehyde by Vacuum Ultraviolet (185 nm) Oxidation,"Vacuum-UV (185 nm, VUV) is widely applied to polish reverse osmosis permeate (ROP), such as the production of electronics-grade ultrapure water. In this study, the VUV oxidation of acetaldehyde, a common carbonyl in ROP, was found to be influenced by anions even at low concentrations. Interestingly, the influencing extent and mechanism varied depending on the anions. Bicarbonate minimally affected the VUV-photon absorption and •OH consumption, but at 5000 μg-C·L–1, it decreased the degradation of acetaldehyde by 58.7% possibly by scavenging organic radicals or other radical chain reactions. Nitrate strongly competed for VUV-photon absorption and •OH scavenging through the formation of nitrite, and at 500 μg-N·L–1, it decreased the removal rate of acetaldehyde degradation by 71.2% and the mineralization rate of dissolved organic carbon by 53.4%. Chloride competed for VUV-photon absorption and also generated reactive chlorine species, which did not affect acetaldehyde degradation but influenced the formation of organic byproducts. The radical chain reactions or activation of anions under VUV irradiation could compensate for the decrease in oxidation performance and need further investigation. In real ROPs, the VUV oxidation of acetaldehyde remained efficient, but mineralization was hindered due to nitrate and chloride anions.

10.1021/acs.est.4c03365,Unveiling the Role of Hydrophobicity on Multilayer Carbon Nanosheets Enriched in sp2-Carbon for Toluene Adsorption under Humid Conditions,"Carbon materials are regarded as a promising adsorbent for the adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, their adsorption behaviors are usually compromised at ambient conditions, attributed to the competitive VOCs adsorption with water vapor. In this study, we demonstrated that the selectivity for toluene than water of carbon can be effectively enhanced by introducing more sp2-carbon with two-dimensional nanosheets stacked. The multilayer carbon nanosheets enriched with sp2-carbon (CNS-MCA) exhibit a 151° H2O-contact angle, indicating hydrophobicity. Dynamic adsorption behaviors revealed that CNS-MCA retain 71% of their toluene adsorption capacity (91 mg/g) even at 60% relative humidity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, static adsorption studies, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and time-resolved in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy collectively indicate that toluene exhibits enhanced adsorption and selectivity due to π–π* interactions between its aromatic rings and the sp2-carbon. Conversely, water adsorption is attenuated, attributed to the reduced availability of surface-exposed hydrogen bonds associated with sp2-carbon and the inherent hydrophobic nature of multilayer graphene.

However, their genomic diversity, ecological niches, and metabolic potentials in the anoxic intertidal aquifers remain poorly understood. Here, we discovered and named a novel AOA genus, Candidatus Nitrosomaritimum, from the intertidal aquifers of Yancheng Wetland, showing close metagenomic abundance to the previously acknowledged dominant Nitrosopumilus AOA. Further construction of ammonia monooxygenase-based phylogeny demonstrated the widespread distribution of Nitrosomaritimum AOA in global estuarine-coastal niches and marine sediment. Niche differentiation among sublineages of this new genus in anoxic intertidal aquifers is driven by salinity and dissolved oxygen gradients. Comparative genomics revealed that Candidatus Nitrosomaritimum has the genetic capacity to utilize urea and possesses high-affinity phosphate transporter systems (phnCDE) for surviving phosphorus-limited conditions. Additionally, it contains putative nosZ genes encoding nitrous-oxide (N2O) reductase for reducing N2O to nitrogen gas. Furthermore, we gained first genomic insights into the archaeal phylum Hydrothermarchaeota populations residing in intertidal aquifers and revealed their potential hydroxylamine-detoxification mutualism with AOA through utilizing the AOA-released extracellular hydroxylamine using hydroxylamine oxidoreductase.

10.1021/acs.est.4c03081,Highly Sensitive Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Detection of Hydroxyl Radicals in Water Microdroplets Using Phthalhydrazide/Ag Nanoparticles Nanosensor,"The spontaneous generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) within atmospheric microdroplets, such as raindrops and aerosols, plays a crucial role in various environmental processes including pollutant degradation and oxidative stress. However, quantifying hydroxyl radicals (•OH), essential for H2O2 formation, remains challenging due to their short lifespan and low concentration. This study addresses this gap by presenting a highly sensitive and selective surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanosensor specifically designed for quantifying •OH within water microdroplets. Utilizing a phthalhydrazide (Phth) probe, the SERS technique enables rapid, interference-free detection of •OH at nanomolar concentrations. It achieves a linear detection range from 2 nM to 2 μM and a limit of detection as low as 0.34 nM. Importantly, the SERS sensor demonstrates robustness and accuracy within water microdroplets, paving the way for comprehensive mechanistic studies of H2O2 generation in the atmosphere.

This phenomenon has been well-documented for glaciers near emission sources. However, less is known about polar ice sheets and ice caps. Radionuclides are one of the contaminants that can be remobilised through ice melting and accumulate in cryoconite material on the surface of glaciers. To understand the cycling of radionuclides in polar glacial contexts, we evaluate the radioactivity of cryoconite samples from Flade Isblink, a High Arctic ice cap in northeast Greenland. The measured radioactivity is among the highest reported across the High Arctic and the highest from Greenland. The high variability observed among the samples is explained by considering the different macroscopic features of single cryoconite deposits. The radioactivity source is compatible with the stratospheric reservoir established during atmospheric nuclear tests and with weapons-grade fissile fuel, likely originating from Novaya Zemlya proving grounds.

10.1021/acs.est.4c03967,Pollutant Emissions and Oxidative Potentials of Particles from the Indoor Burning of Biomass Pellets,"Residential solid fuel combustion significantly impacts air quality and human health. Pelletized biomass fuels are promoted as a cleaner alternative, particularly for those who cannot afford the high costs of gas/electricity, but their emission characteristics and potential effects remain poorly understood. The present laboratory-based study evaluated pollution emissions from pelletized biomass burning, including CH4 (methane), NMHC (nonmethane hydrocarbon compounds), CO, SO2, NOx, PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm), OC (organic carbon), EC (element carbon), PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), EPFRs (environmentally persistent free radicals), and OP (oxidative potential) of PM2.5, and compared with those from raw biomass burning. For most targets, except for SO2 and NOx, the mass-based emission factors for pelletized biomass were 62–96% lower than those for raw biomass. SO2 and NOx levels were negatively correlated with other air pollutants (p < 0.05). Based on real-world daily consumption data, this study estimated that households using pelletized biomass could achieve significant reductions (51–95%) in emissions of CH4, NMHC, CO, PM2.5, OC, EC, PAHs, and EPFRs compared to those using raw biomass, while the differences in emissions of NOx and SO2 were statistically insignificant. The reduction rate of benzo(a)pyrene-equivalent emissions was only 16%, much lower than the reduction in the total PAH mass (78%). This is primarily attributed to the more PAHs with high toxic potentials, such as dibenz(a,h)anthracene, in the pelletized biomass emissions. Consequently, impacts on human health associated with PAHs might be overestimated if only the mass of total PAHs was counted. The OP of particles from the pellet burning was also significantly lower than that from raw biomass by  96%. The results suggested that pelletized biomass could be a transitional substitution option that can significantly improve air quality and mitigate human exposure.",Lu Zhang;Yaojie Li;Jin Li;Ran Xing;Xinlei Liu;Jinfeng Zhao;Guofeng Shen;Bo Pan;Xiangdong Li;Shu Tao,Environmental Science & Technology,TRUE,"['air quality', 'PM2.5', 'satellite observation', 'atmospheric composition', 'emission']",该研究主要关注室内生物质颗粒燃烧产生的污染物排放，并分析了其对空气质量的影响。研究人员通过实验比较了颗粒物中甲烷、非甲烷烃类化合物、一氧化碳、二氧化硫、氮氧化物、PM2.5、有机碳、元素碳、多环芳烃、环境持久性自由基和氧化潜力的排放量，并与原始生物质燃烧进行了对比。研究结果表明，颗粒化生物质燃烧的排放量显著低于原始生物质燃烧，这表明颗粒化生物质可以作为一种过渡性替代方案，显著改善空气质量并减少人类暴露。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。

To maximize the exploitation of water’s promoting effect, we employed ammonia selective catalytic reduction (NH3–SCR) as a probe reaction and proposed a phosphorus modification strategy for Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts. The objective of this approach was to construct water-adaptive microstructures through directional arrangement. To investigate the effect of phosphorus on the transformation of framework copper sites in humid environments, we conducted comprehensive characterizations and density functional theory calculation. Results reveal that water molecules cleave the oxygen bridges between phosphorus oxide and copper, leading to the formation of active isolated [Cu(OH)]+ groups and phosphate. The phosphate species weaken the interaction between exchanged Cu2+ groups and the zeolite framework, leading to the generation of highly migratory hydrated Cu2+ species.

However, the impact of this policy on particle size distribution and composition characteristics remains unclear. Measurements were conducted on nine different vessels (ocean-going vessels, coastal cargo ships, and inland cargo ships) to determine the impact of fuel upgrading (S < 0.1% m/m marine gas oil (MGO) vs S < 0.5% m/m heavy fuel oil (HFO)) on elemental carbon (EC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emitted by ships. (1) Fuel improvement significantly reduced EC and PAH emission, by 31 ± 25 and 45 ± 38%, respectively. However, particle size distributions showed a trend toward finer particles, with the peak size decreasing from DP = 0.38–0.60 μm (HFO) to DP = 0.15–0.25 μm (MGO), and the emission factor of DP < 100 nm increased. (2) Changes in emission characteristics led to an increase in the toxicity of ultrafine particulate matter. (3) Ship types and engine conditions affected the EC and PAH particle size distributions. Inland ships have a more concentrated particle size distribution. Higher loads result in higher emissions.

Herein, integrated transfer learning (TL) and multitask learning (MTL) was proposed for constructing a graph neural network (GNN) model (abbreviated as TL-MTL-GNN model) using n-octanol/water partition coefficients as a source domain. The TL-MTL-GNN model was trained to predict three bioaccumulation parameters based on enlarged data sets that cover 2496 compounds with at least one bioaccumulation parameter.

Recent studies have estimated global foliar Hg assimilation; however, large uncertainties remained due to coarse accounting of observed foliar Hg concentrations, posing a substantial challenge in constraining the global Hg budget. Here, we integrated a comprehensive observation database of foliar Hg concentrations and machine learning algorithms to predict the first spatial distribution of foliar Hg concentrations on a global scale, contributing to the first estimate of global Hg pools in foliage.

Zero liquid discharge (ZLD) is a possible strategy to reduce brine rejection while increasing the resource recovery from desalination plants. However, ZLD substantially increases the energy consumption and carbon footprint of a desalination plant. The predominant strategy to reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint of ZLD is through the use of a hybrid desalination technology that integrates  renewable energy. Here, we built a computational thermodynamic model of the most mature electrified hybrid technology for ZLD powered by photovoltaic (PV). We examine the potential size and cost of ZLD plants in the US. This work explores the variables (geospatial and design) that most influence the levelized cost of water and the second law efficiency. There is a negative correlation between minimizing the LCOW and maximizing the second-law. And maximizing the second-law, the states that more brine produces, Texas is the location where the studied system achieves the lowest LCOW and high second-law efficiency, while California is the state where the studied system is less favorable.

Effect-based methods are used to complement chemical analyses to identify toxicants, yet conventional bioassays typically rely on an apical and/or single endpoint, providing limited diagnostic potential to guide chemical prioritization. We proposed an event-driven taxonomy framework for mixture risk assessment that relied on high-throughput screening bioassays and toxicant identification integrated by deep learning. In this work, the framework was evaluated using chemical mixtures in sediments eliciting aryl-hydrocarbon receptor activation and oxidative stress response. Mixture prediction using target analysis explained <10% of observed sediment bioactivity. To identify additional contaminants, two deep learning models were developed to predict fingerprints of a pool of bioactive substances (event driver fingerprint, EDFP) and convert these candidates to MS-readable information (event driver ion, EDION) for nontarget analysis. Two libraries with 121 and 118 fingerprints were established, and 247 bioactive compounds were identified at confidence level 2 or 3 in sediment extract using GC-qToF-MS.

However, PODs are unavailable for most chemicals in commerce due to a lack of in vivo toxicity data. We therefore developed a two-stage machine learning (ML) framework to predict human-equivalent PODs for oral exposure to organic chemicals based on chemical structure. Utilizing ML-based predictions for structural/physical/chemical/toxicological properties from OPERA 2.9 as features (Stage 1), ML models using random forest regression were trained with human-equivalent PODs derived from in vivo data sets for general noncancer effects (n = 1,791) and reproductive/developmental effects (n = 2,228), with robust cross-validation for feature selection and estimating generalization errors (Stage 2). These two-stage models accurately predicted PODs for both effect categories with cross-validation-based root-mean-squared errors less than an order of magnitude. We then applied one or both models to 34,046 chemicals expected to be in the environment, revealing several thousand chemicals of moderate concern and several hundred chemicals of high concern for health effects at estimated median population exposure levels.

However, its thermostability and catalytic activity still need to be improved to better adapt to complex environmental conditions. This work elucidates the key mechanisms and important residues of the degradation reaction through multiple computational strategies, establishes a mutation library, and obtains 21 single-point mutation designs. Experimental verification showed that 16 single mutants had enhanced thermostability, with the R89F and L197Y mutants showing the highest increases in thermostability at 135 and 119% relative to the wild-type enzyme, respectively. Additionally, as a result of the higher specific activity of D390Q, it was selected for combination mutagenesis, ultimately resulting in three combination mutants (R89F/L197Y, R89F/D390Q, and R89F/L197Y/D390Q) with enhanced thermostability and catalytic activity.

While many studies have developed empirical models to elucidate the effects of meteorology on ozone variability, they predominantly focus on local weather conditions, overlooking the influences from high-altitude and broader regional meteorological patterns. Here, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a technique typically applied to image recognition, to investigate the influence of three-dimensional spatial variations in meteorological fields on the daily, seasonal, and interannual dynamics of ozone in Shenzhen, a major coastal urban center in China. Our optimized CNNs model, covering a 13° × 13° spatial domain, effectively explains over 70% of daily ozone variability, outperforming alternative empirical approaches by 7 to 62%. Model interpretations reveal the crucial roles of 2-m temperature and humidity as primary drivers, contributing 16% and 15% to daily ozone fluctuations, respectively. Regional wind fields account for up to 40% of ozone changes during the episodes. CNNs successfully replicate observed ozone temporal patterns, attributing −5–6 μg·m–3 of interannual ozone variability to weather anomalies.

10.1021/acs.est.3c03906,An Intelligent Early Warning System for Harmful Algal Blooms: Harnessing the Power of Big Data and Deep Learning,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) pose a significant ecological threat and economic detriment to freshwater environments. In order to develop an intelligent early warning system for HABs, big data and deep learning models were harnessed in this study. Data collection was achieved utilizing the vertical aquatic monitoring system (VAMS). Subsequently, the analysis and stratification of the vertical aquatic layer were conducted employing the “DeepDPM-Spectral Clustering” method. This approach drastically reduced the number of predictive models and enhanced the adaptability of the system. The Bloomformer-2 model was developed to conduct both single-step and multistep predictions of Chl-a, integrating the ” Alert Level Framework” issued by the World Health Organization to accomplish early warning for HABs. The case study conducted in Taihu Lake revealed that during the winter of 2018, the water column could be partitioned into four clusters (Groups W1–W4), while in the summer of 2019, the water column could be partitioned into five clusters (Groups S1–S5). Moreover, in a subsequent predictive task, Bloomformer-2 exhibited superiority in performance across all clusters for both the winter of 2018 and the summer of 2019 (MAE: 0.175–0.394, MSE: 0.042–0.305, and MAPE: 0.228–2.279 for single-step prediction; MAE: 0.184–0.505, MSE: 0.101–0.378, and MAPE: 0.243–4.011 for multistep prediction). The prediction for the 3 days indicated that Group W1 was in a Level I alert state at all times. Conversely, Group S1 was mainly under an Level I alert, with seven specific time points escalating to a Level II alert. Furthermore, the end-to-end architecture of this system, coupled with the automation of its various processes, minimized human intervention, endowing it with intelligent characteristics.

Nevertheless, the role of coexistent H2O2 in the transformation from Cu(II) to Cu(I) remained contentious. Herein, with the Cu(II)/PAA process as an example, the respective roles of PAA and H2O2 on the Cu(II)/Cu(I) cycling were comprehensively investigated over the pH range of 7.0–10.5. Contrary to previous studies, it was surprisingly found that the coexistent deprotonated H2O2 (HO2–), instead of PAA, was crucial for accelerating the transformation from Cu(II) to Cu(I) (kHO2–/Cu(II) = (0.17–1) × 106 M–1 s–1, kPAA/Cu(II) < 2.33 ± 0.3 M–1 s–1). Subsequently, the formed Cu(I) preferentially reacted with PAA (kPAA/Cu(I) = (5.84 ± 0.17) × 102 M–1 s–1), rather than H2O2 (kH2O2/Cu(I) = (5.00 ± 0.2) × 101 M–1 s–1), generating reactive species to oxidize organic contaminants. With naproxen as the target pollutant, the proposed synergistic role of H2O2 and PAA was found to be highly dependent on the solution pH with weakly alkaline conditions being more conducive to naproxen degradation.

Machine learning has been previously used to identify compounds based on SERS spectral data. However, utilization of SERS to quantify concentrations, with or without machine learning, has been difficult due to the spectral intensity being sensitive to confounding factors such as the substrate parameters, orientation of the analyte, and sample preparation technique. Here, we demonstrate an approach for predicting the concentration of sample pollutants from SERS spectra using machine learning. Frequency domain transform methods, including the Fourier and Walsh–Hadamard transforms, are applied to spectral data sets of three analytes (rhodamine 6G, chlorpyrifos, and triclosan), which are then used to train machine learning algorithms. Using standard machine learning models, the concentration of the sample pollutants is predicted with >80% cross-validation accuracy from raw SERS data. A cross-validation accuracy of 85% was achieved using deep learning for a moderately sized data set (∼100 spectra), and 70–80% was achieved for small data sets (∼50 spectra). Performance can be maintained within this range even when combining various sample preparation techniques and environmental media interference. Additionally, as a spectral pretreatment, the Fourier and Hadamard transforms are shown to consistently improve prediction accuracy across multiple data sets.

Taking advantage of the modulation of free tropospheric relative humidity by vertical motions, we derive analytical relationships that allow us to retrieve vertical motions in clear air from geostationary measurements of brightness temperature in the infrared absorption band of water vapor. The new observations have a resolution of 1 hr and 2 km in time and space, respectively. They capture the variability of mesoscale and large‐scale vertical velocity measured during field campaigns. In the mid‐troposphere, clear‐sky vertical motions are mostly subsiding but highly heterogeneous in space and time. Around organized deep convective systems, strong subsidence (>500 hPa·day−1) is observed within a distance of a few hundred kilometers. In contrast, transient upward motions of up to 100 hPa·day−1 can occur at the mesoscale. Vertical motions in the clear‐sky atmosphere appear to be primarily associated with buoyancy and gravity waves at the mesoscale, and with radiative cooling and equatorial waves at larger spatial scales.

 The effects of long-term climate warming on soil respiration and its drivers remain unclear in forests, which store approximately 40% of global soil carbon. Here we conducted a climate change experiment for 13 years in forest plots planted with tree juveniles at two southern boreal forest sites. Treatments included simultaneous above- and below-ground warming (ambient, +1.7 °C and +3.3 °C) under different rainfall scenarios (100% and 60% of summer rainfall) and contrasting overstory canopy openness (open and closed). Soil respiration increased by 7% and 17% under +1.7 °C and +3.3 °C warming, respectively, averaged across all sites, treatments and years. These increases in respiration were higher than impacts per degree warming of the only two prior long-term, but soil-only, forest warming experiments. Moreover, warming effects on soil respiration varied significantly over time. Under almost all conditions, moist soil exhibited a greater increase in respiration in response to warming than dry soil. Our results suggest that a realistic range of anticipated conditions, including both above- and below-ground temperature and moisture, should be accounted for when predicting warming effects on soil respiration.

 G-quadruplex (G4) structures are found in eukaryotic cell replication origins, but their role in origin function remains unclear. In this study G4 motifs are found in the lytic DNA replication origin (oriLyt) of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and recombinant viruses show that a G4 motif in oriLyt essential region I (ER-I) is necessary for viral growth. Replication assays of oriLyt-containing plasmids and biochemical/biophysical analyses show that G4 formation in ER-I is crucial for viral DNA replication. G4 pull-down analysis identifies viral DNA replication factors, such as IE2, UL84, and UL44, as G4-binding proteins. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, specific G4-binding ligands inhibit G4 binding by the viral proteins. The Epstein-Barr virus oriLyt core element also forms a stable G4 that could substitute for the oriLyt ER-I G4 in HCMV.

 As regions around the world invest billions in new infrastructure to overcome increasing water scarcity, better guidance is needed to facilitate cooperative planning and investment in institutionally complex and interconnected water supply systems. This work combines detailed water resource system ensemble modeling with multiobjective intelligent search to explore infrastructure investment partnership design in the context of ongoing canal rehabilitation and groundwater banking in California. Here we demonstrate that severe tradeoffs can emerge between conflicting goals related to water supply deliveries, partnership size, and the underlying financial risks associated with cooperative infrastructure investments. We show how hydroclimatic variability and institutional complexity can create significant uncertainty in realized water supply benefits and heterogeneity in partners’ financial risks that threaten infrastructure investment partnership viability. We demonstrate how multiobjective intelligent search can design partnerships with substantially higher water supply benefits and a fraction of the financial risk compared to status quo planning processes.

10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00416,Global Impact of Particulate Nitrate Photolysis on Fine Sulfate Aerosol,"Recent studies have suggested that particulate nitrate (NO3–) photolysis could be an important source of atmospheric oxidants, and one of its main products, N(III), contributes to the heterogeneous formation of sulfate (SO42–) in aerosol water─a potential missing source of SO42– in polluted environments. However, its effects on SO42–and air quality in different regions remain unexplored. In this study, we implement a detailed model representation of SO42– formation via NO3– photolysis into the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. Our results find considerable impacts of NO3– photolysis on surface SO42–, especially over India and other coastal regions (up to 15% increment of annual average concentrations), which were previously unaccounted for in most models. The effects are mainly due to S(IV) oxidation by OH, H2O2, and O3 following renoxification, which outcompetes aqueous oxidation by N(III), contrary to previous laboratory and modeling studies. Further analysis suggests that past studies might have underestimated the particle-to-gas transfer of N(III) in ambient aerosols.

Colonic organoids, with their realistic three-dimensional structure, provide a more physiologically relevant model. Our study used mouse colonic organoids to investigate dietary DEHP exposure on gut endocrine function. Results showed that low doses of DEHP promoted secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), while decreasing cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion. DEHP exposure increased cyclic AMP levels, supporting the secretion of GLP-1, PYY, and GIP, which may enhance insulin secretion.

Here we report the concentrations of organophosphate esters (OPEs), widely used flame retardants and plasticizers, in the SML and underlying waters from a north–south transect in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Generally, concentrations of OPEs in the SML were higher than in the underlying waters. Concentrations in the SML were correlated with the chlorophyll α content for some OPEs, consistent with biogenic surfactants at the SML. The enrichment factors (ratio of concentrations in SML over concentrations in underlying waters) were 5.84 ± 8.97 and 9.10 ± 9.48 for the Atlantic and Southern Oceans, respectively.

10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00453,Catalytic Heaters at Oil and Gas Sites May be a Significant yet Overlooked Seasonal Source of Methane Emissions,"Successful reduction of oil and gas sector methane emissions to meet near-zero intensity targets requires the identification and mitigation of all possible sources. One potentially important source is catalytic heaters, which  have largely escaped attention in regulatory and mitigation efforts despite being ubiquitous at upstream production sites in cold climate regions. This study reports direct in situ measurements of the exhaust streams of 38 natural gas-fired catalytic heaters at upstream production sites in British Columbia, Canada. All heaters in the sample showed consistently poor methane conversion with mean destruction efficiencies of 61 ± 5% while releasing 235 [+31/–28] g of methane per cubic meter of fuel. Although individual units are generally small methane sources (mean of 0.28 ± 0.04 kg/h), their prevalence means they could represent 6% of the total provincial upstream methane inventory and as an aggregate methane source could be 5× more significant than abandoned wells. Notably, these heaters are seasonal sources whose emissions would be missed in measurement campaigns occurring solely in summer months. However, additional measurements from a small number of heat medium burners demonstrate that, where feasible, methane emissions can be reduced by approximately 425× by replacing catalytic heaters with centralized heat systems.",Simon A.

To address this gap, we performed a systematic literature review and curated a large collection of genomes (n = 26,018) representing fecally shed prokaryotic species across broad and narrow source categories commonly implicated in FST studies of recreational waters (i.e., cats, dogs, cows, seagulls, chickens, pigs, birds, ruminants, human feces, and wastewater). We find that across these sources the total number of prokaryotic genomes recovered from materials meeting our initial inclusion criteria varied substantially across fecal sources: from none in seagulls to 9,085 in pigs. We examined genome sequences recovered from these metagenomic and isolation-based studies extensively via comparative genomic approaches to characterize trends across source categories and produce a finalized genome database for each source category which is available online (n = 12,730). On average, 81% of the genomes representing species-level populations occur only within a single source.

10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00451,Formation of Inorganic Sulfate and Volatile Nonsulfated Products from Heterogeneous Hydroxyl Radical Oxidation of 2-Methyltetrol Sulfate Aerosols: Mechanisms and Atmospheric Implications,"Chemical transformation of 2-methyltetrol sulfates (2-MTS), key isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) constituents, through heterogeneous hydroxyl radical (•OH) oxidation can result in the formation of previously unidentified atmospheric organosulfates (OSs). However, detected OSs cannot fully account for the sulfur content released from reacted 2-MTS, indicating the existence of sulfur in forms other than OSs such as inorganic sulfates. This work investigated the formation of inorganic sulfates through heterogeneous •OH oxidation of 2-MTS aerosols. Remarkably, high yields of inorganic sulfates, defined as the moles of inorganic sulfates produced per mole of reacted 2-MTS, were observed in the range from 0.48 ± 0.07 to 0.68 ± 0.07. These could be explained by the production of sulfate (SO4•–) and sulfite (SO3•–) radicals through the cleavage of C–O(S) and (C)O–S bonds, followed by aerosol-phase reactions. Additionally, nonsulfated products resulting from bond cleavage were likely volatile and evaporated into the gas phase, as evidenced by the observed aerosol mass loss (≤25%) and concurrent size reduction upon oxidation. This investigation highlights the significant transformation of sulfur from its organic to inorganic forms during the heterogeneous oxidation of 2-MTS aerosols, potentially influencing the physicochemical properties and environmental impacts of isoprene-derived SOAs.",Rongshuang Xu;Yuzhi Chen;Sze In Madeleine Ng;Zhenfa Zhang;Avram Gold;Barbara J.

However, the underlying mechanisms for this are still unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of hydrochar and pyrochar, examining the soil N2O mitigation potential from denitrification, electron shuttle functionality, soil microbial composition, and denitrification genes dynamics. Our results conclusively establish that hydrochar outperforms pyrochar due to its exceptional electron transfer capacity, characterized by higher electron exchange capacity (EEC), abundance of electron-donating moieties and more prevalent electron transfer components. Notably, the lower concentration of persistent free radicals (PFRs) in hydrochar results in unimpeded expression of the nosZ gene, promoting complete denitrification and resulting in reduced N2O emissions. These findings highlight hydrochar’s potential as an electron shuttle and underscore its promise as a superior soil amendment for mitigating N2O emissions compared to pyrochar.",Dan Yuan;Jiao Yuan;Zhifen Jia;Ping Wu;Chunsheng Hu;Tim J.

10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00522,Field Evidence for Constraints of Nearly Dry and Weakly Acidic Aerosol Conditions on the Formation of Organosulfates,"A global perspective on the abundance and formation of organosulfates (OSs) during field studies (relative humidity of 53% to 77%) suggested that the investigated particles are generally nondry and acidic (pH < 6). However, the key factors affecting OS formation in nearly dry and weakly acidic aerosol conditions remain elusive. This topic was resolved by examining the composition and formation of OSs in PM2.5 collected in Urumqi (dry and dusty) over a one-year period. Anthropogenic OSs accounted for 49 ± 8% of the total OSs, indicating a large anthropogenic contribution to OS formation in Urumqi (particularly in winter). The low aerosol liquid water (ALW) concentration (2 ± 2 μg m–3) and weak particle acidity (pH = 7 ± 2) during the summer were important factors limiting anthropogenic OS formation. However, increased ALW (100 ± 70 μg m–3) and particle acidity (pH = 5 ± 1) during the winter significantly promoted anthropogenic OS production. The formation of most of isoprene- and monoterpene-derived OSs during summer was also constrained by unfavorable ALW concentration and particle acidity, resulting in biogenic OS levels being lower in summer than in winter. This study provides observational evidence on OS formation constraints by dry and dusty atmospheric conditions.",Ting Yang;Yu Xu;Yi-Jia Ma;Yu-Chen Wang;Jian Zhen Yu;Qi-Bin Sun;Hong-Wei Xiao;Hua-Yun Xiao;Cong-Qiang Liu,Environmental Science & Technology Letters,TRUE,"['atmospheric composition', 'aerosol', 'organosulfates', 'air quality', 'satellite observations']",该研究论文主要关注大气中气溶胶的组成和形成，特别是研究了有机硫酸盐（OSs）的形成机制。论文通过对乌鲁木齐一年期的PM2.5样本进行分析，发现干旱和尘土飞扬的环境条件限制了OSs的形成，特别是夏季低液态水含量和弱酸性条件下。论文还分析了不同季节OSs的来源，并指出人为来源的OSs在冬季占主导地位。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为OSs是影响空气质量的重要组分，而卫星观测可以提供关于气溶胶分布和组成的信息，帮助我们更好地理解OSs的形成和演变过程。

Organic aerosol (OA) is often the bottleneck of further reducing PM pollution. To devise effective control measures, the sources of OA must be identified and quantified first. This study expanded the capability of cutting-edge iodide-based chemical ionization mass spectrometry in a source apportionment study by measuring a variety of oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs). A workflow was developed to find suitable tracers from these OOMs. The source apportionment research of OAs was advanced by incorporating these OOM tracers with traditional nonpolar/polar organic tracers. The OOMs-incorporated positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to two unique groups of aerosol samples collected in an inland megacity and an ocean expedition. PMF without OOM tracers overestimated the OA contribution from fossil fuel combustion, plastic burning, and monoterpene SOA. On average, PMF with OOM tracers assigned 28.8% and 44.1% of OA in inland megacity and marine samples, respectively, to 4 new factors: aliphatic SOA, highly oxidized aromatic SOA, sulfur-containing SOA, and nitrogen-containing SOA.

10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00540,Overlooked Chlorination of Aqueous Alcohols: Aldehyde Formation and Artifactual Chlorine Consumption,"In environmental chemistry research, stock solutions of organic compounds are commonly prepared in alcohols (e.g., methanol), including during experiments to quantify oxidation kinetics and disinfection byproduct formation. Lacking an obviously oxidizable functional group, alcohols are tacitly assumed to be inert with respect to common water treatment oxidants and favored for their low cost, low toxicity, and miscibility with water. While attempting to duplicate a previous result reporting formaldehyde as a product of dimethylamine chlorination, we found that a substantial amount of formaldehyde was generated when the dimethylamine dosing solution was prepared in methanol but not when it was prepared in water. We further found that under conditions typical of chlorination kinetics experiments, aqueous methanol concentrations as low as 0.4% (v/v) could significantly deplete chlorine compared to methanol-free controls. In the presence of increasing methanol concentrations, chlorine depletion half-lives decreased to ∼4 h at 2% methanol. Finally, we examined the chlorination of five primary alcohols and one secondary alcohol, which all formed the corresponding carbonyls at comparable rates. These findings raise doubts about the routine use of alcohols as carrier solvents for the preparation of stock solutions in research on aqueous chlorination reactions and highlight alcohols as a potential source of aldehyde formation during chlorination.",Michal Lieberman;Daniel L.

10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00442,Can Qualitative Nontarget Data Be Indicative of PFAS Contamination? First Evidence by Correlation with EOF in Environmental Samples,"We correlated nontarget screening (NTS) features and extractable organic fluorine (EOF) data for PFAS analysis in environmental samples. Soils, sediments, and ashes from different locations (Germany, France, and Lithuania) (n = 34) were analyzed via liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry and high-resolution continuum source-graphite furnace molecular absorption spectrometry. NTS feature prioritization based on mass to carbon (m/C) and mass defect to carbon (MD/C) ratios was applied to discriminate potential PFAS features from common co-extracted organic matrix. Our results show a high correlation between quantitative EOF and the prioritized feature number (R2 = 0.87; rPearson = 0.93) and the total peak area of prioritized features (R2 = 0.97; rPearson = 0.98), while commonly applied MD ranges for filtering showed much weaker correlation with EOF. The observed correlations in PFAS-contaminated samples highlight that MD/C–m/C prioritization is associated with a good indication of the overall PFAS burden as evidenced by EOF. Also, semiquantitative data can be extracted as shown by EOF versus prioritized peak areas. The correlations indicate that weakly fluorinated compounds were negligible and that the EOF was mostly composed of highly fluorinated substances.

Our findings indicate that the size and shape of the microplastics together with the soil type and moisture levels are major determinants of the microplastic enrichment ratio (ER) in dust, overshadowing the role of polymer types. Notably, microplastic pellets larger than 20 μm do not enrich in dust, while microplastic fibers, even those as large as 500–5000 μm in length, do enrich in dust.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00120,Observational Constraints on the Aerosol Optical Depth–Surface PM2.5 Relationship during Alaskan Wildfire Seasons,"Wildfire is one of the main sources of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm) in the Alaskan summer. The complexity in wildfire smokes, as well as limited coverage of ground measurements, poses a big challenge to estimate surface PM2.5 during wildfire season in Alaska. Here we aim at proposing a quick and direct method to estimate surface PM2.5 over Alaska, especially in places exposed to strong wildfire events with limited measurements. We compare the AOD–surface PM2.5 conversion factor (η = PM2.5/AOD; AOD, aerosol optical depth) from the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem (ηGC) and from observations (ηobs). We show that ηGC is biased high compared to ηobs under smoky conditions, largely because GEOS-Chem assigns the majority of AOD (67%) within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) when AOD > 1, inconsistent with satellite retrievals from CALIOP. The overestimation in ηGC can be to some extent improved by increasing the injection height of wildfire emissions. We constructed a piecewise function for ηobs across different AOD ranges based on VIIRS-SNPP AOD and PurpleAir surface PM2.5 measurements over Alaska in the 2019 summer and then applied it on VIIRS AOD to derive daily surface PM2.5 over continental Alaska in the 2021 and 2022 summers. The derived satellite PM2.5 shows a good agreement with corrected PurpleAir PM2.5 in Alaska during the 2021 and 2022 summers, suggesting that aerosol vertical distribution likely represents the largest uncertainty in converting AOD to surface PM2.5 concentrations. This piecewise function, η′obs, shows the capability of providing an observation-based, quick and direct estimation of daily surface PM2.5 over the whole of Alaska during wildfires, without running a 3-D model in real time.",Tianlang Zhao;Jingqiu Mao;Pawan Gupta;Huanxin Zhang;Jun Wang,ACS ES&T Air,TRUE,"['aerosol optical depth', 'PM2.5', 'wildfire', 'satellite observations', 'VIIRS', 'air quality monitoring']",这篇论文研究了利用卫星观测数据（VIIRS）和地面监测数据（PurpleAir）来估算阿拉斯加野火季期间地表PM2.5浓度的方法。研究发现，利用气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）与地表PM2.5浓度之间的转换因子来估算地表PM2.5存在误差，因为气溶胶的垂直分布会影响估算结果。论文提出了一种基于观测数据的分段函数，可以更准确地估算地表PM2.5浓度，并验证了该方法的有效性。
10.1021/acsestair.4c00089,Brown Carbon Emissions from Biomass Burning under Simulated Wildfire and Prescribed-Fire Conditions,"We investigated the light-absorption properties of brown carbon (BrC) as part of the Georgia Wildland-Fire Simulation Experiment. We constructed fuel beds representative of three ecoregions in the Southeastern U.S. and varied the fuel-bed moisture content to simulate either prescribed fires or drought-induced wildfires. Based on decreasing fire radiative energy normalized by fuel-bed mass loading (FREnorm), the combustion conditions were grouped into wildfire (Wild), prescribed fire (Rx), and wildfire involving duff ignition (WildDuff). The emitted BrC ranged from weakly absorbing (WildDuff) to moderately absorbing (Rx and Wild) with the imaginary part of the refractive index (k) values that were well-correlated with FREnorm. We apportioned the BrC into water-soluble (WSBrC) and water-insoluble (WIBrC). Approximately half of the WSBrC molecules detected using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry were potential chromophores. Nevertheless, k of WSBrC was an order of magnitude smaller than k of WIBrC. Furthermore, k of WIBrC was well-correlated with FREnorm while k of WSBrC was not, suggesting different formation pathways between WIBrC and WSBrC. Overall, the results signify the importance of combustion conditions in determining BrC light-absorption properties and indicate that variables in wildland fires, such as moisture content and fuel-bed composition, impact BrC light-absorption properties to the extent that they influence combustion conditions.",Chase K.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00130,"Mortality Attributable to Ambient Fine Particulate Matter Exposure in a Changing Canadian Population, 2001 to 2021","We aim to understand how changes in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over the last two decades have influenced PM2.5-attributable mortality in a Canadian population experiencing both growth and changing baseline health status. We conducted a health impact analysis using dynamic estimates of population, baseline mortality rates, and satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations to estimate mortality attributable to long-term PM2.5 exposure every five years between 2001 and 2021, applying risk estimates from the 2006 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC) to the population aged 25 and older. We conducted a decomposition analysis to examine the influences of population exposure, size, and health status on trends in PM2.5-attributable mortality. Between 2001 and 2021, population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 declined by 18% in Canada, with improvements occurring in most urban areas. In recent years, these changes have led to 4,400 (95% CI: 3,700–5,000) to 4,700 (95% CI: 4,100–5,400) fewer PM2.5-attributable deaths annually based on log–linear and log–log shapes of concentration–response. However, a growing population alongside higher baseline mortality risks in several regions, likely due to aging, has led to a small net increase in total PM2.5-attributable deaths between 2001 and 2021.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00135,"Criteria, Greenhouse Gas, and Hazardous Air Pollutant Emissions Factors from Residential Cordwood and Pellet Stoves Using an Integrated Duty Cycle Test Protocol","Air pollution from residential wood heating (RWH) presents challenges at the intersection of climate and public health. With a revised National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS, at 9 μg/m3) for particulate matter (PM) in the United States (U.S.), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will likely classify new non-attainment areas due primarily to emissions from RWH. Agencies will use emissions factors (EFs) to develop attainment strategies. Many will rely on EPA modeling platforms based on data from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). The NEI uses RWH EFs based on data from mid-1990’s in-situ studies and a speciation profile from a 2001 study of fireplace emissions. The NEI does not include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for this sector, which plays a key role when assessing climate reduction strategies for the buildings sector. Here, we tested seven wood stoves to determine EFs, representing various vintages and control technologies, using a novel test method that reflects in-use operational settings called the Integrated Duty Cycle. The study measured multiple pollutants concurrently: criteria pollutants (particulate matter [PM], CO, and NOx), nonmethane total hydrocarbons (NMTHCs), GHGs, black carbon (eBC), brown carbon (BrC), and multiple hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). We found no significant difference in PM EFs between uncertified and non-catalytic stove technologies. RWH EF results from this study exceeded 2020 NEI RWH EFs for NMTHC and multiple HAPs. Applying our study’s EFs to the 2020 NEI suggests that RWH, compared to all other sources, ranks as the 2nd largest source category of formaldehyde; the 3rd largest of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and acrolein; and the 4th largest of Pb emissions. RWH also emits more methane compared to natural gas or oil residential heating, raising questions about substitution of wood as a climate neutral heating fuel. However, compared to uncertified stoves, pellet stove EFs (except toxic metals) were significantly lower (p < 0.01).

10.1021/acsestair.4c00091,Optical Properties of Biomass Burning Aerosols from Simulated Wildfires and Prescribed Fires with Representative Fuel Beds from the Southeast United States,"We report measurements of the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) and single scattering albedo (SSA) of biomass burning aerosol from the combustion of fuel beds representing three eco-regions of the Southeast U.S. (Piedmont, Coastal Plain, and Blue Ridge Mountains) with moisture content representative of wildfires and prescribed fires. We find a strong correlation between the AAE and SSA for both simulated wildfires (low fuel moisture) and prescribed fires (higher fuel moisture). For wildfires, the AAE and SSA are strongly dependent on the eco-region of the fuel bed and span a much wider range (AAE = 1.3–4.2, SSA = 0.75–0.97) than they do for prescribed fires (AAE = 2.4–3.1, SSA = 0.88–0.96). The AAE and SSA are also found to be correlated with the fraction of total carbon that is elemental carbon (fEC) for both wildfires and prescribed fires, but the range of fEC observed (0.02–0.14) from the fuel beds is much smaller than that reported previously from laboratory studies using individual fuels. The observations from the present study suggest that fuel-bed composition and moisture content are significant factors in determining the relative amount of organic material in biomass burning aerosols and, consequentially, their optical properties.",Zachary C.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00056,Online Calibration of a Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer for Multifunctional Biogenic Organic Nitrates,"Multifunctional organic nitrates derived from biogenic volatile organic compounds are important for understanding ozone and secondary organic aerosol production from oxidation reactions in the presence of nitrogen oxides. Their measurement is challenging, in part because the quantification of these compounds is difficult and time consuming due to the techniques required to synthesize and purify authentic standards. We describe a novel online synthesis and separation technique and demonstrate its use for calibration of a chemical ionization mass spectrometer using iodide reagent ions (I– CIMS) to measure four isomers of isoprene hydroxy nitrate (IHN; C5H9NO4), two isomers of methyl vinyl ketone hydroxy nitrate (MVKHN; C4H7NO5), and four isomers of monoterpene hydroxy nitrate (MTHN; C10H17NO4). We further apply our separation technique to an isoprene + NO3 + HO2 online reactor to calibrate for six isomers of isoprene hydroperoxide nitrate (C5H9NO5). We find a large range of detection sensitivities and ion molecule reactor (IMR) temperature dependencies among the reported analytes measured as iodide (I–) clusters. We report a wide range of normalized sensitivities (normalized Hz pptv–1; nHz pptv–1) normalized by the [I·H2O]− reagent ion signal for this class of analytes (0.2–82 nHz pptv–1). The (4,3)-MVKHN isomer is exceptional for its high sensitivity with this ion chemistry (82 ± 5 nHz pptv–1), which can lead to an inaccurate representation of the organic nitrate budget if a moderate sensitivity is assumed. The I– CIMS demonstrates a much smaller range of sensitivities to IHNs (10–34 nHz pptv–1), with the two most abundant isomers having similar sensitivities ((1,2): 24 ± 3 nHz pptv–1; (4,3): 30 ± 4 nHz pptv–1). These calibrations reveal a significantly different distribution of organic nitrates than would be determined assuming uniform sensitivity for measurements with an I– CIMS at a ground site in Pasadena, CA, during the summer of 2021. A comparison with another calibrated CIMS (using CF3O– reagent ions) for select compounds showed good agreement for IHN and MVKHN.",Michael A. Robinson;James M. Roberts;J.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00064,Effect of the Alkoxy Radical Chemistry on the Ozone Formation from Anthropogenic Organic Compounds Investigated in Chamber Experiments,"The photooxidation of five anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (propane, propene, isopentane, n-hexane, trans-2-hexene) at different levels of nitric oxide (NO) was investigated in the atmospheric simulation chamber SAPHIR, Forschungszentrum Jülich. Measured time series of trace gases and radical concentrations are compared to zero-dimensional box model calculations, based on the Master Chemical Mechanism (agreement within 30%) and complemented by state-of-the-art structure–activity relationships (SAR). Including RO2 isomerization reactions from SAR, validated with theoretical calculations, improves particularly the model–measurement agreement by ∼20% for n-hexane. The photooxidation of the chosen compounds generates different types of peroxy radicals (RO2) which produce HO2 after one or multiple RO2+NO reaction steps, depending on the formed alkoxy radical (RO). Measurements show that the HO2/RO2 ratio is up to ∼40% lower and the number of odd oxygen (Ox = O3+NO2) formed per OH+VOC reaction (P(Ox)VOC) is up to ∼30% higher if RO regenerates RO2 instead of forming HO2 directly. Though, the formation of organic nitrates nearly completely compensates for the ozone production from the second NO reaction step for nitrate yields higher than 20%. Measured and modelled HO2/RO2 ratios agree well as does P(Ox)VOC, derived from measured/modelled radical concentrations and calculated from measured Ox.",Michelle Färber;Hendrik Fuchs;Birger Bohn;Philip T.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00009,"Neighborhood-Level Nitrogen Dioxide Inequalities Contribute to Surface Ozone Variability in Houston, Texas","In Houston, Texas, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution disproportionately affects Black, Latinx, and Asian communities, and high ozone (O3) days are frequent. There is limited knowledge of how NO2 inequalities vary in urban air quality contexts, in part from the lack of time-varying neighborhood-level NO2 measurements. First, we demonstrate that daily TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (TVCDs) resolve a major portion of census tract-scale NO2 inequalities in Houston, comparing NO2 inequalities based on TROPOMI TVCDs and spatiotemporally coincident airborne remote sensing (250 m × 560 m) from the NASA TRacking Aerosol Convection ExpeRiment–Air Quality (TRACER-AQ). We further evaluate the application of daily TROPOMI TVCDs to census tract-scale NO2 inequalities (May 2018–November 2022). This includes explaining differences between mean daily NO2 inequalities and those based on TVCDs oversampled to 0.01° × 0.01° and showing daily NO2 column-surface relationships weaken as a function of observation separation distance. Second, census tract-scale NO2 inequalities, city-wide high O3, and mesoscale airflows are found to covary using principal component and cluster analysis. A generalized additive model of O3 mixing ratios versus NO2 inequalities reproduces established nonlinear relationships between O3 production and NO2 concentrations, providing observational evidence that neighborhood-level NO2 inequalities and O3 are coupled. Consequently, emissions controls specifically in Black, Latinx, and Asian communities will have co-benefits, reducing both NO2 disparities and high O3 days city wide.",Isabella M.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00084,Impact of Model Spatial Resolution on Global Geophysical Satellite-Derived Fine Particulate Matter,"Global geophysical satellite-derived ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) inference relies upon a geophysical relationship (η) from a chemical transport model to relate satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to surface PM2.5. The resolution dependence of simulated η warrants further investigation. In this study, we calculate geophysical PM2.5 with simulated η from the GEOS-Chem model in its high-performance configuration (GCHP) at cubed-sphere resolutions of C360 (∼25 km) and C48 (∼200 km) and satellite AOD at 0.01° (∼1 km). Annual geophysical PM2.5 concentrations inferred from satellite AOD and GCHP simulations at ∼25 km and ∼200 km resolutions exhibit remarkable similarity (R2 = 0.96, slope = 1.03). This similarity in part reflects opposite resolution responses across components with population-weighted normalized mean difference (PW-NMD) increasing by 5% to 11% for primary species while decreasing by −30% to −5% for secondary species at finer resolution. Despite global similarity, our results also identify larger resolution sensitivities of η over isolated pollution sources and mountainous regions, where spatial contrast of aerosol concentration and composition is better represented at fine resolution. Our results highlight the resolution dependence of representing near-surface concentrations and the vertical distribution of chemically different species with implications for inferring ground-level PM2.5 from columnar AOD.",Dandan Zhang;Randall V.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00095,Determination of Legacy and Emerging Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Indoor and Outdoor Air,"Despite increasing awareness of health risks associated with exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), studies on analysis of these chemicals in air are limited. In this study, an extensive sampling of indoor and outdoor air (at a residential neighborhood) was performed to determine the occurrence, temporal variation, and gas/particle partitioning of PFAS. Among 58 PFAS analyzed in air (sum of gas and particulate phases), fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) were found at the highest concentrations (1900 ± 2000 pg/m3). The concentrations of FTOHs and perfluorooctane sulfonamides (FOSA/E) were 4.9−5.9 times higher in indoor air than those in residential outdoor air (p < 0.05). Emerging PFAS such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA), chlorinated polyfluoroether sulfonate (Cl-PFESA), and ADONA were detected at average concentrations ranging from 0.10 to 4.4 pg/m3. We found significant temporal variations in PFAS concentrations, with concentrations higher in warmer than colder months. The majority of ionic PFAS (>50%) such as PFOS were detected in the particulate phase, whereas FTOHs partition predominantly to the vapor phase. This study establishes baseline indoor air concentrations of emerging PFAS and contributes to the understanding of gas−particle partitioning of PFAS.",Wen-Long Li and Kurunthachalam Kannan,ACS ES&T Air,TRUE,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'PFAS', 'indoor air', 'outdoor air']",该研究主要关注室内外空气中全氟烷基和多氟烷基物质（PFAS）的浓度和分布，通过对不同时间和地点的空气样品进行分析，研究了PFAS的时空变化规律以及气相和颗粒相的分配情况。研究结果表明，FTOHs和FOSA/E在室内空气中的浓度明显高于室外空气，并且PFAS的浓度在温暖月份高于寒冷月份。该研究为室内空气中新兴PFAS的基线浓度提供了数据，并有助于理解PFAS的气相-颗粒相分配。虽然该研究没有直接使用卫星遥感技术，但其对PFAS在空气中的浓度和分布的研究结果，可以为大气环境遥感技术提供重要的参考数据，例如，可以用于改进大气模型中PFAS的排放和传输模拟，以及开发新的遥感方法来监测PFAS污染。
10.1021/acsestair.3c00095,Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation from Aqueous Ethylamine Oxidation Mediated by Particulate Nitrate Photolysis,"Atmospheric ethylamine (EA) is emitted by various primary sources and can be found abundantly in the gas and particle phases. Nitrate (NO3–) is one of the most abundant inorganic compounds and has been found to coexist with amines in ambient particles. The photolysis of NO3– can produce oxidants such as the OH radical, NO2, O(3P), and N(III), which can lead to the decay of particulate EA. Moreover, the degradation of EA forms carbonyl species, which are precursors to brown carbon (BrC) formation. In this study, we investigated the aging of EA-containing particles mediated by NO3– photolysis under different relative humidity (RH) and initial pH conditions under 300 nm UV irradiation. The more acidic (pH 0.0, 0.2, and 0.6) particles (EA:H+ molar ratio = 4:4.25, 4:4.5, 4:5 at 70% RH) exhibited an increase in pH, while the less acidic (pH 5.0, 4.8, 4.7, and 5.1) particles (EA:H+ = 4:4 at 40%, 55%, 70%, and 85% RH) showed a decrease in pH as a result of photooxidation. We attributed these contrary pH changes to the combination of the HONO evaporation, which increases the pH, and the EA reactions, which decrease the pH. The decay rates of NO3– and EA appear not to be sensitive to RH and pH within experimental uncertainties. We proposed EA reaction pathways in the presence of oxidants produced from NO3– photolysis based on product speciation. We also observed the formation of water-soluble organics (BrC and an organic phase) as a potential secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This study sheds light on the particulate sink of EA and its potential in BrC and SOA formation mediated by NO3– photolysis in the atmosphere, providing new insights into the aging of amines in atmospheric aerosols.",Xiaomeng Tian;Valeria YeeWan Chan;Chak K.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00030,Estimation and Applications of Uncertainty in Methane Emissions Quantification Technologies: A Bayesian Approach,"An accurate understanding of uncertainty is needed to properly interpret methane emission estimates from upstream oil and gas sources in a variety of contexts, from component-level measurements to yearly jurisdiction-wide inventories. To characterize measurement uncertainty, we examine controlled release (CR) data from five different technology providers including quantitative gas imaging (QOGI), tunable diode laser-absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS); and airborne near-infrared hyperspectral (NIR HS) imaging. We introduce a novel empirical method to develop probability distributions of measurements given a true emission rate using the CR data. The approach includes flexible likelihoods which capture complex relationships in the data. An algorithm which provides the distribution of the true emission rate given a measurement is also developed, which synthesizes the measurement with the CR data and external information about the possible true emission rate. The results show that flexible models that accommodate complex nonlinear behavior are needed to adequately model measurement error. We also show that measurement error can vary under different conditions. We demonstrate that measurement uncertainty can be reduced by performing repeated measurements. A limitation of the study is that the collected CR data is collected under controlled conditions that may differ from those in industrial settings. As new CR data become available, the models presented in this paper can be refit to consider more diverse scenarios. The methodology can be extended to explicitly model different conditions to improve performance.",Augustine Wigle;Audrey Béliveau;Daniel Blackmore;Paule Lapeyre;Kirk Osadetz;Christiane Lemieux;Kyle J.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00113,Machine Learning Model to Predict Saturation Vapor Pressures of Atmospheric Aerosol Constituents,"We present a novel machine learning (ML) model for predicting saturation vapor pressures (psat), a physical property of use to describe transport, distribution, mass transfer, and fate of environmental toxins and contaminants. The ML model uses σ-profiles from the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) as molecular descriptors. The main advantages in using σ-profiles instead of other types of molecular representations are the relatively small size of the descriptor and the fact that the addition of new elements does not affect the size of the descriptor. The ML model was trained separately for liquid and solid compounds using experimental vapor pressures at various temperatures. The 95% confidence intervals of the error in the liquid- and solid-phase log10(psat/Pa) are 1.02 and 1.4, respectively. Especially our solid-phase model outperforms all group-contribution models in predicting experimental sublimation pressures of solid compounds. To demonstrate its applicability, the model was used to predict psat of atmospherically relevant species, and the values were compared with those obtained from a new experimental method. Here, our model provided a tool for a better description of this critical property and gave a higher confidence in the measurements.",Noora Hyttinen;Linjie Li;Mattias Hallquist;Cheng Wu,ACS ES&T Air,TRUE,"['atmospheric aerosol constituents', 'saturation vapor pressures', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",该研究提出了一种新的机器学习模型，用于预测大气气溶胶组分的饱和蒸气压。饱和蒸气压是描述环境毒素和污染物迁移、分布、传质和归宿的重要物理性质。该模型使用COSMO模型的σ-谱作为分子描述符，并分别针对液态和固态化合物进行训练。该模型在预测固态化合物的升华压方面优于所有基团贡献模型。研究表明，该模型可以用于预测大气相关物质的饱和蒸气压，并与新的实验方法获得的结果进行比较。该模型为更好地描述这一关键性质提供了工具，并提高了测量结果的置信度。
10.1021/acsestair.4c00044,The Role of Indoor Surface pH in Controlling the Fate of Acids and Bases in an Unoccupied Residence,"The chemical composition of indoor air is strongly driven by the composition and properties of indoor surfaces. At the Chemical Assessments of Surfaces and Air (CASA) campaign, we performed controlled additions of ammonia (reaching up to 297 ppb to 662 ppb) to investigate the impacts of changing surface basicity on the fate of gaseous and particulate acids and bases in an unoccupied house. In response to ammonia injections, nitrogen-containing compounds (C2–7H3–11N1O0–3) were emitted from surfaces to the gas phase with signals increasing 101% to 104% compared to their signals prior to ammonia addition. At the same time, oxygen-containing compounds (C1–7H2–6O2–3) were removed from the gas phase by indoor surface partitioning. Indoor surface pH and aerosol pH likely increased during these controlled ammonia injections relative to their baseline conditions. We estimate indoor surface pH to be nearly 5 and indoor aerosol pH to range from 2 to 4 during this experiment. At each ammonia injection, we observed ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the aerosol phase to increase due to gas-particle partitioning of ammonia and nitric acid. This gas-particle-surface exchange showed strong dependence on relative humidity; evaporation of gaseous bases was more pronounced at lower relative humidity when surface-associated water volume was reduced, while gas-to-particle partitioning of inorganic species was greater in the presence of more aerosol liquid water at higher relative humidity. From cooking experiments, which represent realistic sources of acids and bases to the indoor environment but which emit 10 times less ammonia than was introduced to the house via pure ammonia injection experiments, we predict that surfaces may still be important sources of these basic gases to indoor air.",Jenna C.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00048,"Atmospheric Aerosol Sulfur Distribution and Speciation in Mexico City: Sulfate, Organosulfates, and Isoprene-Derived Secondary Organic Aerosol from Low NO Pathways","Poor air quality is a persistent challenge in Mexico City, and addressing this issue requires an understanding of the chemical composition of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter). Sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are two of the largest contributors to PM2.5 in Mexico City, but uncertainties exist regarding their sources, distribution across individual particles, and ability to form organosulfates. Herein, we show using electron dispersive x-ray spectroscopy that only 41 ± 1% and 25 ± 1% of particles (aerodynamic diameter, 0.32–0.56 μm) by number at two sites in Mexico City, respectively, contain sulfur. Vibrational spectroscopy (Optical-Photothermal Infrared + Raman Microspectroscopy) shows that these sulfur-containing particles consist of inorganic sulfate (SO42–) and organosulfates (ROSO3–). In addition, we unexpectedly measured abundant isoprene-derived SOA from low nitric oxide reaction pathways, specifically organosulfates (methyltetrol sulfates = avg. 50 ng/m3, max. 150 ng/m3) and polyols (methyltetrols = avg. 70 ng/m3, max. 190 ng/m3) using liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00051,Composition and Sources of Organic Aerosol in Two Megacities in Western China Using Complementary Mass Spectrometric and Statistical Techniques,"Over 300 daily PM2.5 filter samples were collected in two western Chinese megacities, Xi’an and Chongqing, from October 2019 to May 2020. Their aqueous extracts were nebulized simultaneously to an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and a recently developed extractive electrospray ionization (EESI) mass spectrometer, for bulk and near-molecular organic aerosol (OA) composition, respectively. Carbonate was quantified using EESI and a total organic carbon analyzer to separate inorganic carbon from dust. Via isotopically-labelled internal standards and positive matrix factorization, seven water-soluble sources were quantified separately using the AMS- and EESI-based analyses, with consistent types, concentrations, and correlations. These include dust, solid fuel combustion (SFC)-related, nitrogen- (and sulfur-) containing, summer/winter oxygenated OAs, and a cigarette-related OA only in EESI. When accounting for water-solubility, SFC-related OAs were the largest (53%) sources in Chongqing, while dust (consisting of 77% OA and 23% carbonates) was the largest (30%) source in Xi’an. Overall, this study presents one of the first times that complementary mass spectrometric techniques independently resolved consistent OA sources─with added chemical information─over multiple seasons and locations of complex pollution.

10.1021/acsestair.3c00116,"Understanding the Driving Forces of Summer PM1 Composition in Seoul, Korea, with Explainable Machine Learning","This study leverages explainable machine learning, specifically XGBoost models with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to explore the chemical properties of atmospheric aerosols in Seoul, Korea, during the summer of 2019. Focusing on non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM1) properties measured by high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS), the research extends to organic aerosol (OA) sources identified via positive matrix factorization of high-resolution MS data. The models achieved good predictive accuracy (R2 > 0.90) for all species concentrations, except for hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) due to frequent concentration fluctuations. The model outcomes aligned well with those previously achieved using conventional methods (chemical transport model and correlational analysis), confirming that relative humidity is associated with nocturnal nitrate concentration and photochemistry associated with sulfate concentration in the summertime in Seoul. Importantly, the models revealed mostly nonlinear relationships between atmospheric factors, such as temperature and particulate matter (PM) components, thereby deepening the understanding of formation processes. Notably, different potential formation mechanisms were discerned for more oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) and oxidized primary OA (OPOA). For MO-OOA, SHAP analysis showed a plateau in SHAP values at an Ox concentration of 0.085 ppm, which suggested potential fragmentation from further oxidation and agreed with previous chamber experiments.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00016,Aqueous Photolysis of Water-Soluble Brown Carbon from Simulated Prescribed and Wildfire Biomass Burning,"This work, as part of the Georgia Wildland fire Simulation Experiment (G-WISE) campaign, explores the aqueous photolysis of water-soluble brown carbon (W-BrC) in biomass burning aerosols from the combustion of fuel beds collected from three distinct ecoregions in Georgia: Piedmont, Coastal Plain, and Blue Ridge. Burns were conducted under conditions representative of wildfires, which are common unplanned occurrences in Southeastern forests (low fuel moisture content), and prescribed fires, which are commonly used in forest management (higher fuel moisture content). Upon exposure to radiation from UV lamps equivalent to approximately 5 h in the atmosphere, the absorption spectra of all six samples exhibited up to 40% photobleaching in the UV range (280–400 nm) and as much as 30% photo-enhancement in the visible range (400–500 nm). Together, these two effects reduced the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), a measure of the wavelength dependence of the spectrum, from 6.0–7.9 before photolysis to 5.0–5.7 after. Electrospray ionization ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry analysis shows the potential formation of oligomeric chromophores due to aqueous photolysis.

10.1021/acsestair.4c00047,Methylglyoxal-Urea Brown Carbon Aerosol: A Loss Process for Urea,"Recent studies reveal that urea (CO(NH2)2) is often a significant component of tropospheric reactive nitrogen in both the gas- and the condensed-phases; however, little is known about urea sources and sinks. Although it is generally assumed that deposition is the major sink, aqueous reactions in aerosols and clouds may be possible but have yet to be considered. Here, we report a study of the aqueous reactions of urea with methylglyoxal as a function of pH using optical property measurements as a proxy for reaction. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy is used to monitor bulk-phase browning while cavity ringdown and photoacoustic spectroscopies are used to measure the aerosol optical properties. We observe the reaction of urea with methylglyoxal produces brown carbon at low and high pH, with little absorption at mid-pH ranges. The urea brown carbon products absorb well into the visible range, providing a greater overlap with the solar emission spectrum than previously studied brown carbon systems including that of methylglyoxal and ammonium. These experiments suggest that urea could be chemically transformed in aqueous aerosol with the products contributing to aerosol absorption.",Zachary R. Schiffman;Kevin T. Jansen;Eleanor C.

10.1021/envhealth.4c00095,Effect of Fluorine Atoms and Piperazine Rings on Biotoxicity of Norfloxacin Analogues: Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study,"To clarify the effect of the fluorine atom and piperazine ring on norfloxacin (NOR), NOR degradation products (NOR-DPs, P1–P8) were generated via UV combined with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) technology. NOR degradation did not significantly affect cytotoxicity of NOR against BV2, A549, HepG2, and Vero E6 cells. Compared with that of NOR, mutagenicity and median lethal concentration of P1–P8 in fathead minnow were increased, and bioaccumulation factor and oral median lethal dose of P1–P8 in rats were decreased. Molecular docking was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of DNA gyrase A (gyrA) on NOR-DPs to determine the molecular-level mechanism and establish the structure–activity relationship. Results indicated that the most common amino acid residues were Ile13, Ser27, Val28, Gly31, Asp36, Arg46, Arg47, Asp157, and Gly340; hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions played key roles in the inhibitory effect. Binding area (BA) decreased from 350.80 Å2 (NOR) to 346.21 Å2 (P1), and the absolute value of binding energy (|BE|) changed from 2.53 kcal/mol (NOR) to 2.54 kcal/mol (P1), indicating that the fluorine atom mainly affects BA.

10.1021/envhealth.4c00098,Effects on Synaptic Plasticity Markers in Fetal Mice and HT22 Neurons upon F-53B Exposure: The Role of PKA Cytoplasmic Retention,"Chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), a chromium-fog depressant widely utilized as an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate, can transfer from mother to fetus. Recent research has demonstrated that prenatal exposure to F-53B results in synaptic damage in weaning mice. However, the mechanism underpinning F-53B-triggered synaptic damage during fetal development remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of the protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway, a crucial signaling mechanism known as “synaptic switch”, in the early neurotoxicity of F-53B exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Here, C57BL/6 fetal mice were subjected to exposure to F-53B (0, 4, and 40 μg/L) from gestation days (GD) 0 to 14 to evaluate nerve injury prior to delivery. HT22 neurons exposed to F-53B (0, 0.016, 0.08, 0.4, 2, and 10 μmol/L) for 24 h were utilized to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that F-53B significantly increased the fluorescence intensity of Nestin (a neural stem cell marker) in the fetal brain hippocampus (GD14). Subsequently, we found that F-53B downregulated the expression of synaptic plasticity markers (SYP, GAP43, and BDNF) in the fetal brain and HT22 neurons. Further molecular docking analysis revealed that F-53B fits into the ligand-binding pockets of PKA and CREB1. Results showed that F-53B inhibited the translocation of PKA protein from the cytoplasm to the neuronal nuclei and reduced the levels of PKA, CREB1, p-PKA(α/β/γ)-Thr197, and p-CREB1-S133 in the nucleus. Furthermore, the expression of synaptic plasticity markers altered by F-53B could be reversed by a PKA agonist and was intensified by a PKA antagonist. In summary, our findings suggest that intrauterine exposure to F-53B can weaken the expression of synaptic plasticity markers in the fetal brain, with this neurotoxicity being mediated by the cytoplasmic retention of PKA.",Shen-Pan Li;Hui-Xian Zeng;Shuang-Jian Qin;Qing-Qing Li;Lu-Yin Wu;Qi-Zhen Wu;Li-Zi Lin;Guang-Hui Dong;Xiao-Wen Zeng,Environment & Health,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注F-53B对胎儿大脑神经元的影响，通过体内和体外实验研究了F-53B对突触可塑性标记物表达的影响，以及PKA信号通路在其中的作用。研究发现，F-53B导致胎儿大脑中突触可塑性标记物表达下调，并抑制PKA从细胞质转运到细胞核，最终导致突触损伤。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，主要集中在神经毒理学领域。
10.1021/envhealth.4c00113,Discharges of Wastewater Treatment Plants Needed Further Monitoring to Minimize Potential Risk of Entamoeba and Blastocystis for Public Health,"The protozoan parasites Entamoeba histolytica and Blastocystis hominis are responsible for causing human amebiasis and hominis infections, respectively. These infections are highly prevalent and are often linked to waterborne diseases. Due to the absence of regulations for monitoring these protozoa at the discharge points of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the effluents reaching surface waters contribute to waterborne transmission. This underscores the significance of the removal capacities of WWTPs in reducing the spread of these infectious parasites. Therefore, this study examined five different types of WWTPs in Ankara, Turkey, over a year to assess their capacities to remove E. histolytica and B. hominis. The seasonal abundances of genes specific to these protozoa in both the influents and effluents of each WWTP were measured using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The reduction in the number of protozoan rDNA copies between the influent and effluent samples was evaluated as the removal capacity, expressed in log10 reduction (LRV) values. The results elucidated that the removal of E. histolytica and B. hominis was highly affected by the process used. Membrane bioreactor systems displayed the highest removal capacity with LRV > 3. Therefore, discharges of WWTPs with other processes could need further monitoring to minimize the potential risk for public health.",Asli Onursal and Bulent Icgen,Environment & Health,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注的是污水处理厂排放对水体中寄生虫（溶组织内阿米巴和布拉氏酵母菌）的影响，并通过定量PCR技术评估了不同类型污水处理厂对这些寄生虫的去除效率。研究未涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。

10.1021/envhealth.4c00125,"Association between Exposure to Metals during Pregnancy, Childhood Gut Microbiome, and Risk of Intestinal Inflammation in Late Childhood","Alterations to the gut microbiome and exposure to metals during pregnancy have been suggested to impact inflammatory bowel disease. Nonetheless, how prenatal exposure to metals eventually results in long-term effects on the gut microbiome, leading to subclinical intestinal inflammation, particularly during late childhood, has not been studied. It is also unknown whether such an interactive effect drives a specific subgroup of children toward elevated susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. We used an amalgamation of machine-learning techniques with a regression-based framework to explore if children with distinct sets of gut microbes and certain patterns of exposure to metals during pregnancy (metal–microbial clique signature) had a higher likelihood of intestinal inflammation, measured based on fecal calprotectin (FC) in late childhood. We obtained samples from a well-characterized longitudinal birth cohort from Mexico City (n = 108), Mexico. In the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, 11 metals were measured in whole blood. Gut microbial abundances and FC were measured in stool samples from children 9–11 years of age. Elevated FC was defined as having FC above 100 μg/g of stool. We identified subgroups of children in whom microbial and metal–microbial clique signatures were associated with elevated FC (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). In particular, we found two metal–microbial clique signatures significantly associated with elevated FC: (1) low cesium (Cs) and copper (Cu) in the third trimester and low relative abundance of Eubacterium ventriosum (OR [95%CI]: 10.27 [3.57,29.52], FDR < 0.001) and (2) low Cu in the third trimester and high relative abundances of Roseburia inulinivorans and Ruminococcus torques (OR [95%CI]: 7.21 [1.81,28.77], FDR < 0.05).

10.1021/envhealth.4c00077,Associations of Gestational Exposure to Air Pollution and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Placental Inflammation,"Restricted fetal growth (RFG) is a leading contributor to perinatal mortality and has been associated with gestational exposure to air pollution, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study examines the association between trimester-specific and weekly means of air pollution throughout gestation and placental inflammatory markers at delivery. In a prospective cohort study of 263 pregnant women in Rochester, NY, we measured interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in placental tissue and estimated gestational exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 using a high-resolution spatial-temporal model. Exposure to PAHs was estimated using urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) concentrations collected once per trimester. Using distributed lag models with a penalized spline function, each interquartile range (2.6 μg/m3) increase in PM2.5 concentration during gestational weeks 6–11 was associated with decreased placental IL-6 levels (−22.2%, 95% CI: −39.0%, −0.64%). Using multiple linear regression models, each interquartile range increase of 1-OHP was associated with an increase in TNF-α in the first trimester (58.5%, 95% CI: 20.7%, 74.2%), third trimester (22.9%, 95% CI: 0.04%, 49.5%), and entire pregnancy (29.6%, 95%CI: 3.9%,60.6%).

In this environmental and medical big-data era, the Zhejiang Environmental and Birth Health Research Alliance (ZEBRA) maternity cohort was established with the aim of identifying risk factors for perinatal morbidity and mortality from the perspectives of both observational epidemiology and experimental etiology. Compared with conventional birth cohorts, the inclusion of a maternity cohort allows greater scope for research and places an emphasis on maternal health. In particular, it allows us to focus on pregnant women with a history of pregnancy-related illnesses and those planning to have a second or third child. There are currently many pressing issues in perinatal health, including the risk associations between exogenous together with endogenous factors and the occurrence of perinatal abnormalities, pregnancy complications, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is crucial to explore the interaction between environmental exposures and genetic factors affecting perinatal health if we are to improve it. It is also worthwhile to assess the feasibility of the early stage prediction of major perinatal abnormalities.

10.1021/envhealth.4c00071,"Associations between Metals, Serum Folate, and Cognitive Function in the Elderly: Mixture and Mediation Analyses","Exposure to metals may potentially impact cognitive health in the elderly; however, the evidence remains ambiguous. The specific role of serum folate in this relationship is also unclear. We aimed to evaluate the individual and joint impact of metals on cognition in the elderly from the United States and explore the potential mediating effect of serum folate. Data from the NHANES 2011–2014 were used, with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) employed to measure blood metal concentrations. Cognitive function was assessed using tests for immediate, delayed, and working memory: Immediate Recall test (IRT), the Delayed Recall test (DRT), the Animal Fluency test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST). Generalized linear regression models (GLMs), Bayesian kernel machine regression model (BKMR), and quantile g-computation (QG-C) models were used to assess associations between metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, selenium, manganese) and cognition, with mediation analyses examining serum folate’s involvement in metal effects. This study included 2002 participants aged ≥60. GLMs revealed the negative association between cadmium and the z-scores of IRT (β: −0.17,95% CI: −0.30, −0.04) and DSST (β: −0.15,95% CI: −0.27, −0.04), with negative effects also observed in the BKMR and QG-C models. Selenium displayed significantly positive association with cognition across various statistical models, including GLMs, QG-C, and BKMR. Serum folate played a mediating role in the effects of cadmium and selenium exposure on DSST z-scores, with a proportion of mediation of 17% and 10%, respectively.

However, the types of reproductive hormones associated with DEHP vary across the studies. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool existing epidemiological evidence. We searched three databases up to January 31, 2024, for eligible original studies to ultimately include 37 studies from eight countries with a total of 28 911 participants. DEHP exposure was evaluated with urinary metabolites. Since the main types, production sites, blood concentrations, and functions of reproductive hormones differ between men and women, we reported the combined effect values by gender. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, subfertility status, and the national sociodemographic index (SDI) level. Furthermore, the effect of maternal exposure during pregnancy on children’s reproductive hormone levels was analyzed separately. Overall, in general, in men, DEHP was positively correlated with sex hormone binding-globulin (SHBG) and adversely correlated with total testosterone (TT), free androgen index (FAI), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Results indicated that among men of reproductive age, DEHP exposure was associated with more significant hormonal suppression in infertile men compared with fertile men. Notably, age subgroup analysis among women revealed that postmenopausal women were more vulnerable to DEHP, which was related to lower TT and estradiol (E2). However, this study did not observe a significant association between prenatal DEHP metabolites and reproductive hormone levels in children.

Bayesian kernel-machine regression (BKMR) indicated a nonlinear negative association between PAE metabolites (PAEs) and birth weight. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive association between neonatal birth weight and FT3 (β = 41.605; 95% CI: 2.631, 80.380). The BKMR model also found a positive association between thyroid hormones and birth weight but in a nonlinear manner. Additionally, linear regression analyses showed that TSH, TT3, TT4, FT3, and FT4 were associated with PAEs. The BKMR model revealed an inverted U-shaped association of PAEs with TT3 and FT3 and a nonlinear association with TSH, TT4, and FT4. Structural equation modeling revealed that MMP, MIBP, MBP, MEHP, MOP, MBZP, and MEOHP contributed to a net reduction in neonatal birth weight of 32 g through the TT3, FT3, TT4, and FT4 pathways. The findings suggest that exposure to PAEs during pregnancy leads to a reduction in neonatal birth weight, possibly due to the involvement of maternal thyroid hormones as mediators. Controlling maternal thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy may be a viable method to reduce the harmful effects of phthalate exposure on the developing fetus.",Lin Tao;Dengqing Liao;Shimin Xiong;Lulu Dai;Yuan-zhong Zhou;Xubo Shen,Environment & Health,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注的是邻苯二甲酸酯暴露对新生儿出生体重的影响，以及母体甲状腺激素在其中的作用。研究使用了流行病学方法，收集了母婴对的数据，并通过统计分析来探究邻苯二甲酸酯暴露、母体甲状腺激素水平和新生儿出生体重之间的关系。研究结果表明，邻苯二甲酸酯暴露会降低新生儿出生体重，母体甲状腺激素可能在其中起着中介作用。该研究与大气环境遥感技术无关。
10.1021/envhealth.4c00052,Lung Single-Cell Transcriptomics Offers Insights into the Pulmonary Interstitial Toxicity Caused by Silica Nanoparticles,"The adverse respiratory outcomes motivated by silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) exposure have received increasing attention. Herein, we aim to elucidate the interplay of diverse cell populations in the lungs and key contributors in triggering lung injuries caused by SiNPs. We conducted a subchronic respiratory exposure model of SiNPs via intratracheal instillation in Wistar rats, where rats were administered with 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 mg/kg body weight SiNPs once a week for 12 times in total. We revealed that SiNPs caused pulmonary interstitial injury in rats by histopathological examination and pulmonary hydroxyproline determination. Further, a single-cell RNA-Seq via screening 10 457 cells in the rat lungs disclosed cell-specific responses to SiNPs and cell-to-cell interactions within the alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts from rat lungs. These disturbed responses were principally related to the dysregulation of protein homeostasis (proteostasis), accompanied by an inflammatory response in macrophages, cell death in epithelial, proliferation, and extracellular matrix deposition in fibroblast. These cell-specific responses may serve a synergistic role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary interstitial disease triggered by SiNPs. In particular, the analyses of gene interaction networks and gene–disease associations filtered out heat shock proteins (Hsps) family genes crucial to the observed pulmonary lesions caused by SiNPs. Of note, both GEO database analysis and our experiments’ validation indicated that Hsps, especially Hspd1, may be a key contributor to pulmonary interstitial injury, possibly through triggering oxidative stress, immune response, and disrupting protein homeostasis. Taken together, our study provides insights into pulmonary toxic effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of SiNPs from a single-cell perspective.",Yan Li;Qing Yao;Hailin Xu;Jiaze Ren;Yurou Zhu;Caixia Guo;Yanbo Li,Environment & Health,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注的是二氧化硅纳米颗粒对肺部的毒性影响，使用单细胞转录组测序技术分析了不同细胞类型对纳米颗粒的反应，并发现热休克蛋白（Hsps）家族基因在肺间质损伤中起关键作用。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，因为它主要关注的是纳米材料对生物体的毒性影响，而非大气成分的监测或分析。
10.1021/envhealth.4c00042,"Pollution Characteristics and Ecological Impact of Screening Analysis of Fishing Port Sediments from Dalian, North China","Environmental pollution from synthetic chemical mixtures has significant adverse impacts on marine ecosystems. However, identifying the main constituents of chemical mixtures that pose ecological threats is challenging due to the necessity of an integrated workflow for comprehensive identification and toxicological prioritization of pollutants. Here, an all-in-one mass spectrometric strategy integrating target, suspect, and nontarget analysis was used to investigate organic pollutants of concern in fishing port sediments, with 355 pollutants (32 from target analysis, 118 from suspect screening and 205 from nontarget analysis) identified in 11 categories. The chemical classes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and intermediates were the extensively detected chemical classes. The ecological risks of absolutely quantified pollutants (i.e., 16 parent PAHs, 7 organophosphate esters (OPEs), 10 pesticides and 4 benzotriazole ultraviolet absorbers) were assessed using toxicity-weighted concentration ranking, with o,p’-DDT being the major contributor. Under the toxicological priority index (ToxPi) framework, an extended ranking of all identified pollutants was achieved by combining instrument response and detection frequency, with a priority control list of 15 pollutants obtained, of which benzo[ghi]perylene (BghiP) and p,p’-DDE had the highest risk priority. Due to frequent detection rates and significant environmental risks, routine monitoring of petroleum pollutants is considered essential.

We conducted a prospective birth cohort study of 2860 mother–child pairs, measured the urinary concentrations of 41 antibiotics and their two metabolites over three trimesters, and assessed children’s autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms at 3 years of age. We examined the associations between prenatal antibiotic exposure and children’s ASD symptoms. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression screened for Tetracycline and Ofloxacin as important predictors of ASD symptoms. Modified Poisson regression models revealed that maternal Tetracycline exposure throughout pregnancy increased the risk of ASD symptoms (RR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.40). Maternal Tetracycline exposure during the first (RR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.68) and third trimesters (RR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.16, 3.00) increased the risk of ASD symptoms in boys, and Ofloxacin exposure during the first trimester (RR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.02) increased the risk of ASD symptoms in girls.

10.1021/envhealth.4c00053,Differences in Toxicokinetics and Maternal Transfer between Lipophilic and Proteinophilic Halogenated Organic Pollutants in Laying Hens,"In this study, we conducted exposure experiments on egg-laying hens to explore the toxicokinetics and maternal transfer characteristics of lipophilic and proteinophilic halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs). The lipophilic HOPs included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and dechlorane plus (DPs), while the proteinophilic HOPs included perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The results revealed that most of lipophilic HOPs exhibit lower depuration rate (kd) than PFCAs. The kd of lipophilic HOPs correlated with the octanol–water partition coefficient (log KOW) values in a V-shaped curve, whereas that of PFCAs correlated with the protein–water partition coefficient (log KPW) values in an inverted V-shaped curve. The depuration rate, rather than the uptake rate, was a leading factor in determining the bioaccumulation potential of HOPs in hens. Although the dominant factors determining the tissue distribution of the two types of compounds were explicit (fats vs phospholipids), chemical-specific tissue distribution was still observed. The egg-maternal concentration ratio was dependent on the exposure status, concentration, and maternal tissue choice. Using a single maternal tissue may not be an appropriate method for assessing chemical maternal transfer potential. PFCAs have a greater maternal transfer potential (>80% of the total body burden) than lipophilic HOPs (approximately 30% for BDE209 and DPs, and less than 10% for the others). Their lipophilic and partly proteinophilic nature makes the toxicokinetics and maternal transfer characteristics of BDE209 and DPs different from those of other lipophilic HOPs.

Although there has been extensive research on microplastics and nanoplastics, little has been said about the differences in their behavior in the aquatic environment, and many studies have considered them as the same class of hazardous materials; but in fact, microplastics and nanoplastics should be considered as two different types of environmentally hazardous materials. In this review, we propose that microplastics and nanoplastics behave in the aquatic environment in a size-dependent manner and should be distinguished. And we systematically analyzed the differences in the behavior of microplastics and nanoplastics in the aquatic environment in terms of five aspects: 1) distribution behavior; 2) adsorption behavior; 3) reaction with natural colloids; 4) aging and leaching behavior; 5) interaction with organisms.

10.1021/envhealth.4c00031,Protein Corona Formation on Cadmium-Bearing Nanoparticles: Important Role of Facet-Dependent Binding of Cysteine-Rich Proteins,"Cadmium-bearing nanoparticles, such as nanoparticulate cadmium selenide (CdSe) and cadmium sulfide (CdS), widely exist in the environment and originate from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Risk assessment of these nanoparticles cannot be accurate without taking into account the properties of the protein corona that is acquired by the nanoparticles upon biouptake. Here, we show that the compositions of the protein corona on CdSe/CdS nanoparticles are regulated collectively by the surface atomic arrangement of the nanoparticles and the abundance and distribution of cysteine moieties of the proteins in contact with the nanoparticles. A proteomic analysis shows that the observed facet-dependent preferential binding of proteins is mostly related to the cysteine contents of the proteins, among commonly recognized protein properties controlling the formation of the protein corona. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the atomic arrangement of surface Cd atoms, as dictated by the exposed facets of the nanoparticles, controls the specific binding mode of the S atoms in the disulfide bonds of the proteins. Supplemental protein adsorption experiments confirm that disulfide bonds remain intact during protein adsorption, making the binding of protein molecules sensitive to the abundance and distribution of Cd-binding moieties and possibly molecular rigidity of the proteins. The significant conformational changes of adsorbed proteins evidenced from a circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis suggest that disrupting the structural stability of proteins may be an additional risk factor of Cd-bearing nanoparticles.

The extent to which these large-scale initiatives are actually achieving their multiple and potentially conflicting objectives, however, is largely unknown. Sembrando Vida, a national initiative in Mexico implemented in 2019, pays smallholder farmers to plant agroforests in order to reduce poverty and forest loss, and protect biodiversity. We assessed to what degree program recruitment met its stated objectives via its selection of participating municipalities and households. Because program data are not publicly available, we consolidated and harmonized >14 million policy payments (totaling ∼$4 billion USD) to smallholder farmers, thus creating the first spatiotemporal dataset of program outcomes. We found that ∼450k rural households in ∼1000 municipalities across the country participated in the program consistently from 2019 to 2022. The program was reasonably well targeted to achieve its poverty reduction objectives. Significantly more households (ANOVA, p < 0.001) were enrolled in high-poverty (10.4%) than low-poverty (4.9%) municipalities, despite more money being transferred in absolute terms to low-poverty municipalities. The program did not reach some regions that best fit its three goals. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial model, we showed that the distribution of participating households was more likely to address poverty (coefficient = 0.51, p < 0.001 at household level) and forest cover loss (0.1, p = 0.01) than to restore areas important for biodiversity (−0.08, p = 0.02). Finally, we conducted a spatial analysis showing that there is technically sufficient rural land (4.29 Mha) and households (491k) to maximize the potential of all policy objectives simultaneously, but this would require that the program operate in only 83 municipalities across 10 states.

10.1088/1748-9326/ad6ea5,Simulation of wetland distribution in the Yellow River Basin based on an improved Markov-FLUS model,"Wetlands, as a regulator of water cycle and balance, play a key role in preventing flood and drought disasters and protecting biodiversity. The Yellow River Basin is an important ecological barrier and economic zone in our country. By predicting the distribution of wetland landscape and evaluating its evolutionary characteristics, strategies for wetland conservation and utilization in the Yellow River Basin can be formulated. Future land use simulation model can not only simulate the change of multiple land use types, but also reflect the uncertainty of real land use change. In this study, the model was improved and used to predict future wetland changes in the Yellow River Basin. Using the wetland distribution data in 2000 as the initial data, and the wetland distribution data in 2015 as the validation data, setting the parameters according to the land use data of the Yellow River Basin from 1980 to 2000 and the wetland type transfer matrix, after verifying the applicability of the model, the spatial distribution pattern of wetlands in the Yellow River Basin in 2030 was simulated. This research shows that the cost matrix setting method based on the wetland transfer matrix can effectively avoid the errors caused by subjective judgment assignment. By 2030, the wetland distribution in the Yellow River Basin will remain stable, with marshes, paddy fields, and beaches as the main types, similar to 2015.

10.1088/1748-9326/ad64ed,The status of algal decarbonization in Southeast Asian region: a review,"Due to their autotrophic nature, algae capture large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it to chemical energy in the form of biomolecules and cell mass for various applications. Such bio-based CO2 capture plays an important role in global carbon neutrality, while making innovative and sustainable food and industrial products for human and animal use. This review broadly illustrates the total CO2 emissions of the Southeast Asian region, named as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), while estimating CO2 capture by regional commercial algae. Among all these nations, the top CO2 emitter in the ASEAN region is Indonesia (625 Mt yr−1) followed by Vietnam (311 Mt yr−1), Thailand (289 Mt yr−1), Malaysia (249 Mt yr−1), the Philippines (154 Mt yr−1), Singapore (52 Mt yr−1), Myanmar (49 Mt yr−1), Cambodia (16 Mt yr−1), Laos and Brunei (7 Mt yr−1). Indonesia is also ranked first in commercial algae production (9918 400 tons yr−1), followed by the Philippines (1500 326 tons yr−1) and Malaysia (188 110 tons yr−1). Similarly, the highest estimated algal CO2 capture is made by Indonesia (11 327 817 tons yr−1) followed by the Philippines (1705 871 tons yr−1) and Malaysia (214 279 tons yr−1), with other ASEAN countries having negligible algal CO2 capture due to either low algae production or a lack of data. The ASEAN region may play a pivotal role in the bio-capture of CO2 with the help of the phytoplanktonic aquaculture industry for value-added products. The rapid emergence of the algal industry in the ASEAN region was due to increased global demand for carrageenophyte seaweeds (98.63% of global), such as Eucheuma sp., from Indonesia and Kappaphycus alvarezii from Malaysia and the Philippines. Due to its tropical climate, high aquatic biodiversity, sufficient water and nutrient resources, and long coastlines, the ASEAN regional governments took prompt action and implemented policies for increased seaweed industry in the region.

Here, we review the literature on factors relevant to shifting total transport activity and mode shares, categorised into exogenous drivers, socio-behavioural, infrastructural and technological aspects. For each factor, we summarise current approaches to modelling and measuring the impact of each factor on transport systems, resulting in a proposed taxonomy to classify transport demand modelling approaches. We then comment on the suitability and sufficiency of existing modelling approaches for representing scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement targets in models of the entire global energy system. Factors that affect transport demand are currently insufficiently represented in integrated assessment modelling approaches and thus emission reduction pathways.

Although global warming has led to a decline in overall ECE occurrences, the changes in humid ECEs remain uncertain. This study uses dry and wet-bulb temperatures to categorize dry and humid ECEs across China and analyzes the proportion of humid ECEs, and the underlying factors influencing this phenomenon. In contrast to the decreasing trend of winter relative humidity (RH), our findings show an increase in RH during ECEs. This observation suggests a shift toward more humid conditions during these events. Further analysis shows an increasing percentage of humid ECEs, especially in Xinjiang, where the occurrence of dry ECEs is decreasing.

10.1088/1748-9326/ad6ceb,Multi-scale impacts of climate change on hydropower for long-term water-energy planning in the contiguous United States,"Climate change impacts on watersheds can potentially exacerbate water scarcity issues where water serves multiple purposes including hydropower. The long-term management of water and energy resources is still mostly approached in a siloed manner at different basins or watersheds, failing to consider the potential impacts that may concurrently affect many regions at once. There is a need for a large-scale hydropower modeling framework that can examine climate impacts across adjoining river basins and balancing authorities (BAs) and provide a periodic assessment at regional to national scales. Expanding from our prior assessment only for the United States (US) federal hydropower plants, we enhance and extend two regional hydropower models to cover over 85% of the total hydropower nameplate capacity and present the first contiguous US-wide assessment of future hydropower production under Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6’s high-end Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5 emission scenario using an uncertainty-aware multi-model ensemble approach. We present regional hydropower projections, using both BA regions and US Hydrologic Subregions (HUC4s), to consistently inform the energy and water communities for two future periods—the near-term (2020–2039) and the mid-term (2040–2059) relative to a historical baseline period (1980–2019). We find that the median projected changes in annual hydropower generation are typically positive—approximately 5% in the near-term, and 10% in the mid-term. However, since the risk of regional droughts is also projected to increase, future planning cannot overly rely on the ensemble median, as the potential of severe hydropower reductions could be overlooked.

10.1088/1748-9326/ad6cec,Socially vulnerable US Pacific Northwest communities are more likely to experience wildfires,"Quantitative wildfire risk assessments increasingly are used to prioritize areas for investments in wildfire risk mitigation actions. However, current assessments of wildfire risk derived from fire models built primarily on biophysical data do not account for socioeconomic contexts that influence community vulnerability to wildfire. Research indicates that despite accounting for only a small proportion of high wildfire hazard areas, communities with fewer socioeconomic resources to devote to wildfire prevention and response may experience outsized exposure and impacts. We examined the distribution of simulated wildfire risk versus observed wildfire experience relative to social vulnerability across communities in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Using three decades of wildfire occurrence data, we investigated whether socially vulnerable communities were more likely to experience ignitions, fires that escaped initial attack (hereafter ‘escaped fires’) (>121 hectares), and large fires (>404 hectares), reasoning that each may reveal key insights into the effectiveness of current wildfire risk mitigation and response efforts. We found that communities located in areas with higher wildfire risk or hazard tended to have lower social vulnerability, but that across landscapes east of the Cascade Range, communities with higher social vulnerability were more likely to be exposed to ignitions, escaped fires, and large fires. Our results draw into question whether the current reliance on biophysical data in wildfire risk assessments, absent consideration of community socioeconomic conditions, may perpetuate social inequities by leading to over-investment in well-resourced communities and under-investment in socially vulnerable communities subject to disproportionate wildfire exposure.",Caitlyn Reilley;Christopher J Dunn;Mindy S Crandall;Jeffrey D Kline,Environmental Research Letters,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要研究了美国太平洋西北地区社会脆弱社区在野火风险方面的暴露情况，分析了社会脆弱性与野火发生率之间的关系。研究发现，社会脆弱性高的社区更容易遭受野火点燃、火势蔓延和大型火灾的威胁，而当前以生物物理数据为主的野火风险评估方法可能导致对社会脆弱社区的投资不足，加剧了社会不平等。论文没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。

10.5194/acp-24-9323-2024,On the sensitivity of aerosol–cloud interactions to changes in sea surface temperature in radiative–convective equilibrium,"We examine the combined effect of aerosols and sea surface temperature (SST) on clouds under equilibrium conditions in cloud-resolving radiative–convective equilibrium simulations. We demonstrate that the aerosol–cloud interaction's effect on top-of-atmosphere energy gain strongly depends on the underlying SST, while the shortwave part of the spectrum is significantly more sensitive to SST. Furthermore, increasing aerosols influences upper-troposphere stability and thus anvil cloud fraction. 
 Clouds play a vital role in regulating Earth's energy balance and are impacted by anthropogenic aerosol concentration (Na) and sea   surface temperature (SST) alterations. Traditionally, these factors, aerosols and SST, are investigated independently. This study employs   cloud-resolving, radiative–convective-equilibrium (RCE) simulations to explore aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) under varying SSTs. ACIs are   found to be SST-dependent even under RCE conditions. Notably, changes in cloud radiative effects for both longwave radiation and shortwave radiation lead  to a decrease in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy gain with increasing Na. The changes in TOA shortwave flux exhibit greater sensitivity to underlying SST conditions compared to longwave radiation. To comprehend these trends, we perform a linear decomposition, analyzing the responses of different cloud regimes and contributions from changes in the cloud's opacity and occurrence. This breakdown reveals that ice and shallow clouds predominantly contribute to the radiative effect, mostly due to changes in the cloud's opacity and due to the Twomey effect, which is proportional to the baseline cloud fraction. Moreover, with an increase in Na, we observe an increase in latent heat release at the upper troposphere associated with heightened production of snow and graupel. We show that this trend, consistently across all SSTs, affects the anvil cloud cover by affecting the static stability at the upper troposphere via a similar mechanism to the stability iris effect, resulting in an increase in outgoing longwave radiation. In conclusion, under the ongoing climate change, studying the sensitivity of clouds to aerosols and SST should be conducted concomitantly as mutual effects are expected.",Suf Lorian;Guy Dagan,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,TRUE,"['aerosols', 'cloud', 'satellite observations', 'radiative transfer', 'climate change']",该研究探讨了气溶胶和海面温度对云层的影响，并利用云分辨辐射对流平衡模拟来研究这种相互作用。研究发现，气溶胶-云相互作用对云层的辐射效应具有显著影响，而这种影响与海面温度密切相关。研究还发现，气溶胶的变化会影响高层大气稳定性，进而影响云层的覆盖范围。该研究对于理解气候变化背景下云层对气溶胶和海面温度的敏感性具有重要意义。
10.5194/acp-24-9309-2024,Mechanistic insight into the kinetic fragmentation of norpinonic acid in the gas phase: an experimental and density functional theory (DFT) study,"This paper outlines a unique scientific strategy for studying the reactivity of atmospherically relevant norpinonic acid (NA). The publication offers a new toolbox, illustrating NA's fragmentation and pattern of kinetic degradation leading to the formation of new small molecules. Furthermore, the research strategy presented here demonstrates how a mass spectrometer can function as a gas-phase reactor and the quantum chemistry method can serve as a reaction model builder. 
 Norpinonic acid has been known as an important α-pinene atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA) component. It is formed in the reaction of α-pinene, β-pinene or verbenone with atmospheric oxidizing reagents. In the presented study, tandem mass spectrometry techniques were used to determine the exact norpinonic acid fragmentation pathway in the gas phase. The precursor anion – deprotonated norpinonic acid (m/z 169), generated in an electrospray (ESI) source – was introduced into the collision cell of the mass spectrometer and fragmented using the energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation (ER-CID) technique. The experimental energy values of degradation processes were determined via analysis of the breakdown curves. Quantum chemical calculations of the reaction models were also constructed, including calculation of all transition states. Comparison between the experimental and the theoretical threshold energies calculated at a ωB97XD/6-311+G(2d,p) theoretical level has shown a good correlation. Two basic pathways of the fragmentation of the parent anion [M-H]− (m/z 169) were observed. Firstly this leads to the decarboxylation product (m/z 125) and secondly to the loss of a neutral molecule (C4H6O), together with the formation of the anion m/z 99. On the other hand, the breakdown of the anion m/z 125 gives rise to the m/z 69, 57 and 55 ions. To confirm structures formed during ER-CID experiments, the gas-phase proton transfer reactions were examined of all norpinonic acid anionic fragments with a series of neutral reagents, characterized by proton affinity (PA) values. Based on PA difference analysis, the most possible chemical structures were proposed for the observed fragment anions.",Izabela Kurzydym;Agata Błaziak;Kinga Podgórniak;Karol Kułacz;Kacper Błaziak,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,TRUE,"['atmospheric composition', 'secondary organic aerosol (SOA)', 'mass spectrometry', 'gas-phase chemistry', 'quantum chemistry']",这篇论文研究了大气中的一种重要有机气溶胶成分——降冰片酮酸 (NA) 的气相分解机制。研究人员利用串联质谱技术分析了 NA 在气相中的分解路径，并结合量子化学计算模拟了反应过程。研究结果揭示了 NA 分解的两个主要途径，并通过质子转移反应确定了碎片离子的结构。这项研究为理解大气中 SOA 的形成和演化提供了重要的科学依据，也为利用质谱技术研究气相化学反应提供了新的方法。
10.5194/acp-24-9339-2024,Observed and CMIP6-model-simulated organic aerosol response to drought in the contiguous United States during summertime,"Droughts immensely increased organic aerosol (OA) in the contiguous United States in summer (1998–2019), notably in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Southeast (SEUS). The OA rise in the SEUS is driven by the enhanced formation of epoxydiol-derived secondary organic aerosol due to the increase in biogenic volatile organic compounds and sulfate, while in the PNW, it is caused by wildfires. A total of 10 climate models captured the OA increase in the PNW yet greatly underestimated it in the SEUS. 
 Drought events have been linked with the enhancements of organic aerosols (OAs), but the mechanisms have not been comprehensively understood. This study investigates the relationships between the monthly standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and surface OA in the contiguous United States (CONUS) during the summertime from 1998 to 2018. OA under severe drought conditions shows a significant increase in mass concentrations across most of the CONUS relative to non-drought periods, with the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Southeast United States (SEUS) experiencing the highest average enhancement of 1.79 µg m−3 (112 %) and 0.92 µg m−3 (33 %), respectively. In the SEUS, a linear regression approach between OA and sulfate was used to estimate the epoxydiol-derived secondary organic aerosol (IEPOX SOA), which is the primary driver of the OA enhancements under droughts due to the simultaneous increase in emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs; such as isoprene and monoterpene) and sulfate. The rise in sulfate is mainly caused by the reduced wet deposition because of the up to 62 % lower precipitation amount. In the PNW, OA enhancements are closely linked to intensified wildfire emissions, which raise OA mass concentrations to be 4–8 times higher relative to non-fire conditions. All 10 Earth system models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) can capture the slopes between SPEI and OA in the PNW, with CESM2-WACCM and GFDL-ESM4 performing the best and worst in predicting the OA enhancement under severe droughts. However, all models significantly underestimate the OA increase in the SEUS, with Nor-ESM2-LM and MIRCO6 showing relatively better performance. This study reveals the key drivers of the elevated OA levels under droughts in the CONUS and underscores the deficiencies of current climate models in their predictive capacity for assessing the impact of future droughts on air quality.",Wei Li;Yuxuan Wang,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,TRUE,"['organic aerosol', 'air quality', 'satellite observations', 'drought', 'climate models']",该研究探讨了美国大陆夏季干旱期间有机气溶胶 (OA) 的变化，并利用 CMIP6 气候模型进行模拟。研究发现，干旱会显著增加 OA 浓度，特别是在太平洋西北部 (PNW) 和美国东南部 (SEUS)。PNW 的 OA 增加主要由野火排放引起，而 SEUS 的 OA 增加则与生物挥发性有机化合物 (VOC) 和硫酸盐的增加有关，导致环氧二醇衍生的二次有机气溶胶 (IEPOX SOA) 形成增加。研究还评估了 10 个 CMIP6 模型对 OA 变化的模拟能力，发现模型在 PNW 的模拟结果较好，但在 SEUS 的模拟结果明显偏低。该研究揭示了干旱条件下 OA 浓度升高的关键驱动因素，并强调了当前气候模型在预测未来干旱对空气质量影响方面的不足。
10.5194/acp-24-9277-2024,An air quality and boundary layer dynamics analysis of the Los Angeles basin area during the Southwest Urban NOx and VOCs Experiment (SUNVEx),"Large-scale weather patterns are isolated from local patterns to study the impact that different weather scales have on air quality measurements. While impacts from large-scale meteorology were evaluated by separating ozone (O3) exceedance (>70 ppb) and non-exceedance (<70 ppb) days, we developed a technique that allows direct comparisons of small temporal variations between chemical and dynamics measurements under rapid dynamical transitions. 
 The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory (CSL) conducted the Southwest Urban NOx and VOCs Experiment (SUNVEx) to study emissions and the role of boundary layer (BL) dynamics and sea-breeze (SB) transitions in the evolution of coastal air quality. The study presented utilizes remote sensing and in situ observations in Pasadena, California. Separate analyses are conducted on the synoptic conditions during ozone (O3) exceedance (>70 ppb) and non-exceedance (<70 ppb) days, as well as the fine-structure variability of in situ chemistry measurements during BL growth and SB transitions.Diurnal analyses spanning August 2021 revealed a markedly different wind direction during evenings preceding O3 exceedance (northerly) versus non-exceedance (easterly) days. Increased O3 occurred simultaneously with warmer and drier conditions, a reduction in winds, and an increase in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). While the average BL height was lower and surface pressure was higher, the day-to-day variability of these quantities led to an overall weak statistical relationship. Investigations focused on the fine-structure variability of in situ chemistry measurements superimposed on background trends were conducted using a novel multivariate spectral coherence mapping (MSCM) technique that combined the spectral structure of two or more independent measurements through a wavelet analysis as reported by maximum-normalized scaleograms.  A case study was chosen to illustrate the MSCM technique, where the dominant peaks in scaleograms were identified and compared to BL height during the growth phase.  The temporal widths of peaks (τmax) derived from VOC and nitrogen oxide (NOx) scaleograms, as well as scaleograms combining VOCs, NOx, and variations in BL height, indicated a broadening with respect to time as the BL increased in depth. A separate section focused on comparisons between τmax and BL height during August 2021 revealed uncorrelated or weakly correlated scatter, except in the case of VOCs when really large τmax and relatively deep BL heights were ignored.  Instances of large τmax  and relatively deep BL heights occurred near sunrise and as onshore flow entered Pasadena, respectively.  Wind transitions likely influenced both the dynamical evolution of the BL and tracer advection and thus offer additional challenges when separating factors contributing to the fine structure.  Other insights gained from this work include observations of descending wind jets from the San Gabriel Mountains that were not resolved by the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model and the derivation of intrinsic properties of oscillations observed in NOx and O3 during the interaction between an SB and enhanced winds above the BL that flowed in opposition to the SB.",Edward J.

10.5194/acp-24-9263-2024,Measurement report: Formation of tropospheric brown carbon in a lifting air mass,"Brown carbon (BrC) is prevalent in the troposphere and can efficiently absorb solar and terrestrial radiation. Our observations show that the enhanced light absorption of BrC relative to black carbon at the tropopause can be attributed to the formation of nitrogen-containing organic compounds through the aqueous-phase reactions of carbonyls with ammonium. 
 An enhanced formation of brown carbon (BrC) with a non-negligible warming effect at the tropopause has recently been found. However, its formation mechanism is unclear. Here, we report on a BrC formation process that happens during air mass upward transport by conducting simultaneous measurements on atmospheric BrC with a 4 h time resolution at the mountain foot (MF, 400 m a.s.l.) and mountainside (MS, 1120 m a.s.l.) of Mt. Hua, China, in the 2016 summer. Our results showed that the daytime light absorption (abs365 nm) of BrC on the MS is approximately 60 % lower than that at the MF due to a dilution effect caused by the planetary boundary layer expansion, but the daytime light absorption of BrC relative to black carbon on the MS is about 30 % higher than that at the MF, suggesting a significant formation of secondary BrC in the lifting process of air mass from the MF to the MS. Such a secondary formation accounted for > 50 % of BrC on the MS but only 27 % of BrC at the MF. Moreover, the N:C elemental ratio of the daytime BrC was 15 % higher on the MS than that at the MF, mainly due to an aerosol aqueous-phase formation of water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) compounds. Stable nitrogen isotope composition further indicated that such light-absorbing WSON compounds were produced from the aerosol aqueous-phase reaction of carbonyls with NH4+. Our work revealed, for the first time, that ammonia-induced aerosol aqueous reactions can significantly promote BrC formation during the air mass lifting process, which is probably responsible for an enhanced light absorption of BrC in the upper boundary layer.",Can Wu;Xiaodi Liu;Ke Zhang;Si Zhang;Cong Cao;Jianjun Li;Rui Li;Fan Zhang;Gehui Wang,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,TRUE,"['brown carbon', 'troposphere', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'light absorption', 'aerosol', 'ammonia', 'aqueous-phase reactions']",这篇论文研究了对流层褐碳的形成机制，特别关注了氨气诱导的气溶胶水相反应在空气团抬升过程中的作用。研究人员通过在华山山脚和山腰进行同步观测，发现山腰的褐碳吸收光能力明显高于山脚，并将其归因于气溶胶水相反应生成的含氮有机化合物。这项研究对理解褐碳在对流层中的形成和演化，以及其对气候变化的影响具有重要意义。
10.5194/acp-24-9219-2024,Understanding the role of contrails and contrail cirrus in climate change: a global perspective,"Radiative forcing of contrails could triple by 2050 due to increased air traffic and potential changes in flight altitudes. Factors like air traffic patterns, fuel efficiency, alternative fuels, and climate change further influence this impact. By highlighting gaps in knowledge and uncertainties, this research helps set priorities for future studies and assess strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of aviation emissions. 
 Globally, emissions from aviation affect Earth's climate via complex processes. Contrail cirrus and carbon dioxide emissions are the largest factors contributing to aviation's radiative forcing on climate. Contrail cirrus, like natural cirrus clouds, impacts Earth's climate. Even with the extensive ongoing research, the relative importance of the climate effects of contrails compared to other aviation effects on climate still has major uncertainties requiring further research. Contrail cirrus encompasses linear contrails and the associated cirrus clouds; these are characterized by ice particle properties, e.g., size, concentration, mixing, extinction, ice water content, optical depth, geometrical depth, and cloud coverage. The climate impact of contrails may intensify due to projected increases in air traffic. The radiative forcing from global contrail cirrus has the potential to triple and could reach as much as 160 mW m−2 by 2050. This projection is based on anticipated growth in air traffic and a potential shift to higher altitudes. The future climate impact of contrail cirrus is influenced by factors like the magnitude and geographical spread in air traffic, advancements in fuel efficiency, the effects of the use of alternative fuels, and the effects of the changing climate on the background atmosphere. This study reviews the microphysical processes affecting contrail formation and the aging of contrails and contrail cirrus.

Results show distinct differences based on both air mass source region (North America, Ocean, Caribbean/North Africa) and altitude for a given air mass type. This work highlights the sensitivity of remote marine areas to long-range transport and the importance of considering the vertical dependence of trace gas and aerosol properties. 
 Remote marine regions comprise a high fraction of Earth's surface, but in situ vertically resolved measurements over these locations remain scarce. Here we use airborne data during 15 vertical spiral soundings (0.15–8.5 km) over Bermuda during the NASA Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions over the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) to investigate the impact of different source regions on the vertical structure of trace gases, aerosol particles, and meteorological variables over 1000 km offshore of the US East Coast. Results reveal significant differences in vertical profiles of variables between three different air mass source categories (North America, Ocean, Caribbean/North Africa) identified using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model: (i) the strongest pollution signature is from air masses from the North America category, while the weakest one is from the Ocean category; (ii) North America air has the highest levels of CO, CH4, submicron particle number concentration, aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) mass, and organic mass fraction along with smoke layers in the free troposphere (FT); (iii) Ocean air has the highest relative amount of nitrate, non-sea-salt sulfate, and oxalate, which are key acidic species participating in chloride depletion; (iv) air masses from the Caribbean/North Africa showed a pronounced coarse aerosol signature in the FT and reduced aerosol hygroscopicity, which is associated with dust transport; and (v) there is considerable vertical heterogeneity for almost all variables examined, including higher O3 and submicron particle concentrations with altitude, suggesting that the FT is a potential contributor of both constituents in the marine boundary layer.

10.5194/acp-24-9119-2024,Solar cycle signatures in lightning activity,"Lightning and extreme weather can endanger people and technology. Despite advances in science, not all the factors that lead to the formation of thunderclouds, to their charging and to lightning ignition are known in detail. This paper shows that lightning frequency may, to some extent, be modulated by solar activity and solar wind. Namely, in the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly of the Earth's magnetic field, it correlates with the polarity and intensity of the solar wind. 
 The cross-correlation between annual lightning frequency and solar activity and the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) is examined on a global scale using corrected data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) for the period 2009 to 2022. Relatively large regions with significant cross-correlation coefficients (p<0.05) between the yearly lightning rates and sunspot number (SSN) are found in eastern Africa, part of South America overlapping with the South Atlantic Anomaly, and the Indian Ocean and west coast of Australia. The main region that shows a significant correlation between lightning activity and the By component of the HMF and the magnetopause reconnection Kan–Lee electric field matches the South Atlantic Anomaly quite well. Also shown are areas that show a significant cross-correlation of lightning activity with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation index.Similar areas of significant cross-correlation are obtained if simulated thunder days are used instead of lightning counts. Possible mechanisms leading to the observed correlations and limitations of the current study are discussed. The findings of the present study do not support previous works indicating that cosmic ray intensity is in phase with the global occurrence of lightning, but they do not rule out the role of cosmic rays in lightning ignition in developed thunderclouds and the role of energetic particles precipitating from the magnetosphere in the significant correlation between lightning and the By component of the HMF (SSN) in the South Atlantic Anomaly.",Jaroslav Chum;Ronald Langer;Ivana Kolmašová;Ondřej Lhotka;Jan Rusz;Igor Strhárský,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,TRUE,"['lightning', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition', 'solar activity', 'magnetic field', 'WWLLN']",这篇论文研究了太阳活动对全球闪电频率的影响。研究者利用世界范围闪电定位网络（WWLLN）的数据，分析了2009年至2022年期间闪电频率与太阳黑子数、太阳风磁场等因素之间的相关性。研究发现，在南大西洋异常区，闪电频率与太阳风磁场的极性和强度存在显著相关性。这表明，太阳活动可能通过影响地球磁场和大气电场，进而影响闪电的发生。这项研究利用卫星观测数据，分析了大气电场与闪电之间的关系，属于大气环境遥感技术范畴。

Our study highlights the differences in aerosol–cloud interactions between land and ocean and between precipitation clouds and non-precipitation clouds, and it differentiates and quantifies their underlying mechanisms. 
 In this study we explore aerosol–cloud interactions in liquid-phase clouds over eastern China (EC) and its adjacent ocean (ECO) using the WRF-Chem–SBM model with four-dimensional assimilation. The results show that our simulations and analyses based on each vertical layer provide a more detailed representation of the aerosol–cloud relationship compared to the column-based analyses which have been widely conducted previously. For aerosol activation, cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) generally increases with aerosol number concentration (Naero) at low Naero and decreases with Naero at high Naero. The main difference between EC and ECO is that Nd increases faster in ECO than EC at low Naero due to abundant water vapor, whereas at high Naero, when aerosol activation in ECO is suppressed, Nd in EC shows significant fluctuation due to strong surface effects (longwave radiation cooling and terrain uplift) and intense updrafts. Cloud liquid water content (CLWC) increases with Nd, but the increase rate gradually slows down for precipitating clouds, while CLWC increases and then decreases in non-precipitating clouds. Higher Nd and CLWC can be found in EC than in ECO, and the transition-point Nd value at which CLWC in non-precipitating clouds changes from increasing to decreasing is also higher in EC. Aerosol activation is strongest at moderate Naero, but CLWC increases relatively fast at low Naero.

10.5194/acp-24-9177-2024,Investigation of the impact of satellite vertical sensitivity on long-term retrieved lower-tropospheric ozone trends,"Ozone is a potent air pollutant in the lower troposphere, with adverse impacts on human health. Satellite records of tropospheric ozone currently show large-scale inconsistencies in long-term trends. Our detailed study of the potential factors (e.g. satellite errors, where the satellite can observe ozone) potentially driving these inconsistencies found that, in North America, Europe, and East Asia, the underlying trends are typically small with large uncertainties. 
 Ozone is a potent air pollutant in the lower troposphere and an important short-lived climate forcer (SLCF) in the upper troposphere. Studies investigating long-term trends in the tropospheric column ozone (TCO3) have shown large-scale spatio-temporal inconsistencies. Here, we investigate the long-term trends in lower-tropospheric column ozone (LTCO3, surface–450 hPa sub-column) by exploiting a synergy of satellite and ozonesonde data sets and an Earth system model (UK's Earth System Model, UKESM) over North America, Europe, and East Asia for the decade 2008–2017. Overall, we typically find small LTCO3 linear trends with large uncertainty ranges using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), while model simulations indicate a stable LTCO3 tendency. The satellite a priori data sets show negligible trends, indicating that any year-to-year changes in the spatio-temporal sampling of these satellite data sets over the period concerned have not artificially influenced their LTCO3 temporal evolution. The application of the satellite averaging kernels (AKs) to the UKESM simulated ozone profiles, accounting for the satellite vertical sensitivity and allowing for like-for-like comparisons, has a limited impact on the modelled LTCO3 tendency in most cases. While, in relative terms, this is more substantial (e.g. on the order of 100 %), the absolute magnitudes of the model trends show negligible change. However, as the model has a near-zero tendency, artificial trends were imposed on the model time series (i.e. LTCO3 values rearranged from smallest to largest) to test the influence of the AKs, but simulated LTCO3 trends remained small. Therefore, the LTCO3 tendencies between 2008 and 2017 in northern-hemispheric regions are likely to be small, with large uncertainties, and it is difficult to detect any small underlying linear trends due to interannual variability or other factors which require further investigation (e.g. the radiative transfer scheme (RTS) used and/or the inputs (e.g. meteorological fields) used in the RTS).",Richard J.

10.5194/acp-24-9085-2024,Relations between cyclones and ozone changes in the Arctic using data from satellite instruments and the MOSAiC ship campaign,"Cyclones strongly influence weather predictability but still cannot be fully characterised in the Arctic because of the sparse coverage of meteorological measurements. A potential approach to compensate for this is the use of satellite measurements of ozone, because cyclones impact the tropopause and therefore also ozone. In this study we used this connection to investigate the correlation between ozone and the tropopause in the Arctic and to identify cyclones with satellite ozone observations. 
 Large-scale meteorological events (e.g. cyclones), referred to as synoptic events, strongly influence weather predictability but still cannot be fully characterised in the Arctic region because of the sparse coverage of measurements. Due to the fact that atmospheric dynamics in the lower stratosphere and troposphere influence the ozone field, one approach to analyse these events further is the use of space-borne measurements of ozone vertical distributions and total columns in addition to conventional parameters such as pressure or wind speed. In this study we investigate the link between cyclones and changes in stratospheric ozone by using a combination of unique measurements during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) ship expedition, ozone profile and total column observations by satellite instruments (OMPS-LP, TROPOMI), and ERA5 reanalysis data. The final goal of the study is to assess whether the satellite ozone data can be used to obtain information about cyclones and provide herewith an additional value in the assimilation by numerical weather prediction models. Three special cases during the MOSAiC expedition were selected and classified for the analysis. They are one “normal” cyclone, where a low surface pressure coincides with a minimum in tropopause height, and two “untypical” cyclones, where this is not observed. The influence of cyclone events on ozone in the upper-troposphere lower-stratosphere (UTLS) region was investigated, using the fact that both are correlated with tropopause height changes. The negative correlation between tropopause height from ERA5 and ozone columns was investigated in the Arctic region for the 3-month period from June to August 2020. This was done using total ozone columns and sub-columns from TROPOMI, OMPS-LP, and MOSAiC ozonesonde data. The greatest influence of tropopause height changes on ozone contour levels occurs at an altitude between 10 and 20 km. Moreover, the lowering of the 250 ppb ozonopause (at about 11 km altitude) below 9 km was used to detect cyclones using OMPS-LP ozone observations. The potential of this approach was demonstrated in two case studies where the boundaries of cyclones could be determined using ozone observations. The results of this study can help improve our understanding of the relationship between cyclones, tropopause height, and ozone in the Arctic and demonstrate the usability of satellite ozone data in addition to the conventional parameters for investigating cyclones in the Arctic.",Falco Monsees;Alexei Rozanov;John P.

10.5194/acp-24-9059-2024,Differences in aerosol and cloud properties along the central California coast when winds change from northerly to southerly,"The predominant wind direction along the California coast (northerly) reverses several times during the summer (to southerly). The effects of these wind reversals on aerosol and cloud characteristics are not well understood. Using data from multiple datasets we found that southerly flow periods had enhanced signatures of anthropogenic emissions due to shipping and continental sources, and clouds had more but smaller droplets. 
 Wind reversals resulting in southerly flow along the California coast are not well understood in terms of how aerosol and cloud characteristics change. This gap is addressed using airborne field measurements enhanced with data from spaceborne remote sensing (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), surface stations (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments), and models (Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System and Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System), with a focus on submicron and supermicron aerosol, as well as cloud microphysical variables: cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud droplet effective radius (re). Southerly flow coincided with higher values of submicron aerosol concentration (Na) and mass concentrations of species representative of fine-aerosol pollution (NO3- and nss-SO42-) as well as shipping and continental emissions (V, oxalate, NH4+, Ni, OC, and EC). Supermicron Na did not change; however, heightened levels of acidic species in southerly flow coincided with reduced Cl− : Na+, suggestive of Cl− depletion in salt particles. Clouds responded correspondingly in southerly flow, with more acidic cloud water and higher levels of similar species as in the aerosol phase (e.g., NO3-, nss-SO42-, NH4+, V), along with elevated values of Nd and COT and reduced re during campaigns with similar cloud liquid water paths. Case study flights help to visualize offshore pollution gradients and highlight the sensitivity of the results to the presence of widespread smoke coverage including how associated plumes have enhanced supermicron Na.

10.5194/acp-24-9155-2024,"Characterization of the particle size distribution, mineralogy, and Fe mode of occurrence of dust-emitting sediments from the Mojave Desert, California, USA","In this research, we studied the dust-emitting properties of crusts and aeolian ripples from the Mojave Desert. These properties are key to understanding the effect of dust upon climate. We found two different playa lakes according to the groundwater regime, which implies differences in crusts' cohesion state and mineralogy, which can affect the dust emission potential and properties. We also compare them with Moroccan Sahara crusts and Icelandic top sediments. 
 Constraining dust models to understand and quantify the effect of dust upon climate and ecosystems requires comprehensive analyses of the physiochemical properties of dust-emitting sediments in arid regions. Building upon previous studies in the Moroccan Sahara and Iceland, we analyse a diverse set of crusts and aeolian ripples (n=55) from various potential dust-emitting basins within the Mojave Desert, California, USA. Our focus is on characterizing the particle size distribution (PSD), mineralogy, aggregation/cohesion state, and Fe mode of occurrence. Our results show differences in fully and minimally dispersed PSDs, with crusts exhibiting average median diameters of 92 and 37 µm, respectively, compared to aeolian ripples with 226 and 213 µm, respectively. Mineralogical analyses unveiled strong variations between crusts and ripples, with crusts being enriched in phyllosilicates (24 % vs. 7.8 %), carbonates (6.6 % vs. 1.1 %), Na salts (7.3 % vs. 1.1 %), and zeolites (1.2 % and 0.12 %) and ripples being enriched in feldspars (48 % vs. 37 %), quartz (32 % vs. 16 %), and gypsum (4.7 % vs. 3.1 %). The size fractions from crust sediments display a homogeneous mineralogy, whereas those of aeolian ripples display more heterogeneity, mostly due to different particle aggregation. Bulk Fe content analyses indicate higher concentrations in crusts (3.0 ± 1.3 wt %) compared to ripples (1.9 ± 1.1 wt %), with similar proportions in their Fe mode of occurrence: nano-sized Fe oxides and readily exchangeable Fe represent ∼1.6 %, hematite and goethite ∼15 %, magnetite/maghemite ∼2.0 %, and structural Fe in silicates ∼80 % of the total Fe. We identified segregation patterns in the PSD and mineralogy differences in Na salt content within the Mojave basins, which can be explained by sediment transportation dynamics and precipitates due to groundwater table fluctuations described in previous studies in the region. Mojave Desert crusts show similarities with previously sampled crusts in the Moroccan Sahara in terms of the PSD and readily exchangeable Fe yet exhibit substantial differences in mineralogical composition, which should significantly influence the characteristic of the emitted dust particles.",Adolfo González-Romero;Cristina González-Flórez;Agnesh Panta;Jesús Yus-Díez;Patricia Córdoba;Andres Alastuey;Natalia Moreno;Melani Hernández-Chiriboga;Konrad Kandler;Martina Klose;Roger N.

10.5194/acp-24-9045-2024,International airport emissions and their impact on local air quality: chemical speciation of ambient aerosols at Madrid–Barajas Airport during the AVIATOR campaign,"This paper investigates emissions from aviation activities at an international airport to evaluate their impact on local air quality. The study provides detailed insights into the chemical composition of aerosols and key pollutants in the airport environment. Source apportionment analysis using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) identified three significant sources: less oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol, alkane organic aerosol, and more oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol. 
 Madrid–Barajas Airport (MAD) is the fourth-busiest airport in Europe. The aerosol chemical composition and the concentrations of other key pollutants were measured at the airport perimeter during October 2021 to assess the impact of airport emissions on local air quality. A high-fidelity ambient instrumentation system was deployed at Madrid–Barajas Airport to measure the following: concentrations of organic aerosols (with their composition), black carbon (eBC), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), total hydrocarbon (THC), and total particle number. The average concentrations of eBC, NOx, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO, and THC at the airport for the entire campaign were 1.07 µg m−3, 22.7 µg m−3, 4.10 µg m−3, 9.35 µg m−3, 16.43 µg m−3, 0.23 mg m−3, and 2.30 mg m−3, respectively. The source apportionment analysis of the non-refractory organic aerosol (OA) using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) allowed us to discriminate between different sources of pollution, namely less oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA), alkane organic aerosol (AlkOA), and more oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA). The results showed that LO-OOA and MO-OOA account for more than 80 % of the total organic particle mass measured near the runway. Trace gases correlate better with the AlkOA factor than LO-OOA and MO-OOA, indicating that AlkOA is mainly related to primary combustion emissions. Bivariate polar plots were used for pollutant source identification. Significantly higher concentrations of the obtained factors were observed at low wind speeds (<3 m s−1) from the southwest, where two of the runways and all terminals are located. Higher SO2/NOx and CO/eBC ratios were observed when the winds originated from the northeast, where the two northern runways are located. These elevated ratios are attributed to the aircraft activity being the major pollutant source in the northeast area.",Saleh Alzahrani;Doğuşhan Kılıç;Michael Flynn;Paul I.

10.5194/acp-24-9031-2024,The effect of different climate and air quality policies in China on in situ ozone production in Beijing,"The impact of combined air quality and carbon neutrality policies on O3 formation in Beijing was investigated. Emissions inventory data were used to estimate future pollutant mixing ratios relative to ground-level observations. O3 production was found to be most sensitive to changes in alkenes, but large reductions in less reactive compounds led to larger reductions in future O3 production. This study highlights the importance of understanding the emissions of organic pollutants. 
 In recent years, clean air policies have led to reductions in air pollution across China. Alongside this, emerging carbon neutrality (CN) policies that aim to address the impacts of climate change may also deliver air quality (AQ) co-benefits or climate penalties. Different CN policies will lead to different changes in volatile organic compound (VOC), NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions, which will in turn impact the photochemical production of secondary pollutants such as ozone (O3). It is currently unclear how different combinations of AQ and CN policies may impact in situ O3 production across China in the future. A detailed chemical box model incorporating the Master Chemical Mechanism was developed to investigate the impact of combined AQ and CN policies on O3 formation in Beijing. The Multi-resolution Emission Inventory model for Climate and air pollution research (MEIC) and the Dynamic Projection model for Emissions in China (DPEC) were used to estimate future pollutant mixing ratios, relative to ambient observations of 35 VOCs, NOx, CO and aerosol surface area (ASA) during the APHH-Beijing 2017 summer campaign. The most ambitious policy scenario, “Ambitious Pollution 1.5D Goals”, led to the largest reduction in O3 production by 2060 but was not the most impactful scenario for reducing O3 production between 2030–2045. Larger reductions were observed under the “Ambitious Pollution Neutral Goals” policy, which focuses on achieving net zero by 2060. O3 production was found to be most sensitive to changes in the OLE2 group of VOCs (alkenes where kOH>7×104 ppm−1 min−1; a 5 % increase in OLE2 increased simulated O3 production by 1.12 %). However, reducing less reactive but higher concentration species in Beijing (such as short-chain alkanes) led to larger reductions in O3 production under all scenarios. O3 production was not sensitive to changes in ASA, with a 69 % decrease in ASA leading to a change of <1 % in O3. However, doubling biogenic VOCs in the model further increased O3 production in 2060 under all future scenarios by up to 18 %, indicating that the influence of future climate-induced changes in biogenic emissions may have a significant impact on in situ O3 formation in Beijing. This study highlights that the emission trajectories of certain specific VOCs are highly influential in determining possible future O3 air quality effects that may arise from increasing ambient temperatures and decarbonisation in Beijing.",Beth S.

10.5194/acp-24-9019-2024,Cooling radiative forcing effect enhancement of atmospheric amines and mineral particles caused by heterogeneous uptake and oxidation,"This study reveals heterogeneous oxidation causes further radiative forcing effect (RFE) enhancement of amine–mineral mixed particles. Note that RFE increment is higher under clean conditions than that under polluted conditions, which is contributed to high-oxygen-content products. The enhanced RFE of amine–mineral particles caused by heterogenous oxidation is expected to alleviate warming effects. 
 The warming radiative forcing effect (RFE) derived from atmospheric amines attracts a lot of attention because of their contribution to brown carbon. Herein, the enhanced influence of amines (methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethylamine) on cooling RFE of mineral particles is first confirmed at visible wavelengths. Present results state heterogeneous uptake and oxidation reactions of atmospheric amines are feasible on mineral particles under clean and polluted conditions, which are proven by related thermodynamics and kinetics data obtained using combined classical molecular dynamics and density function theory methods. Based on mineral particles, simple forcing efficiency (SFE) results explain that amine uptake induces at least 11.8 %–29.5 % enhancement on cooling RFE of amine–mineral particles at visible wavelengths. After amine heterogeneous oxidation, oxidized amine–mineral particle cooling RFEs are furthermore enhanced due to increased oxygen contents. Moreover, oxidized amine–mineral particles under clean conditions show 27.1 %–47.1 % SFE increments at 400–600 nm, which is at least 11.3 % higher than that of itself under polluted conditions, due to high-oxygen-content product formation through amine autoxidation. Our results suggest cooling RFE derived from atmospheric amines can be equally important to their warming RFE on the atmosphere. It is necessary to update the heterogeneous oxidation mechanism and kinetics data of amines in atmospheric models in order to accurately evaluate the whole RFE caused by amines on the atmosphere.",Weina Zhang;Jianhua Mai;Zhichao Fan;Yongpeng Ji;Yuemeng Ji;Guiying Li;Yanpeng Gao;Taicheng An,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,TRUE,"['atmospheric composition', 'aerosol optical properties', 'satellite remote sensing']",该研究探讨了大气中胺类物质与矿物颗粒的混合物对辐射强迫效应的影响。研究发现，胺类物质在矿物颗粒表面发生非均相氧化反应，会导致其冷却辐射强迫效应增强。这对于理解大气中气溶胶的辐射特性以及评估其对气候变化的影响具有重要意义。研究结果表明，胺类物质的非均相氧化反应需要纳入大气模型中，以更准确地评估其对大气辐射平衡的影响。
10.5194/acp-24-8963-2024,"Impacts of atmospheric circulation patterns  and cloud inhibition on aerosol radiative effect  and boundary layer structure during winter  air pollution in Sichuan Basin, China","To identify cloud, aerosol, and planetary boundary layer (PBL) interactions from an air quality perspective, we summarized two pollution patterns characterized by denser liquid cloud and by obvious cloud radiation interaction (CRI). Numerical simulation experiments showed CRI could cause a 50 % reduction in aerosol radiation interaction (ARI) under a low-trough system. The results emphasized the nonnegligible role of CRI and its inhibition of ARI under wet and cloudy pollution synoptic patterns. 
 Persistent winter aerosol pollution frequently occurs in the Sichuan Basin (SCB) due to its unfavourable weather conditions, such as low wind, wetness, and cloudiness. Based on long-term observational data analyses from 2015–2021, it has been found that the four representative stations in  the SCB often simultaneously experience PM2.5 pollution accompanied by variations in meteorological conditions above 850 hPa, which indicates a connection between regional winter air pollution in the SCB and large-scale synoptic patterns. The dominant 850 hPa synoptic patterns of winter in the SCB were classified into six patterns using T-model principal component analysis: (1) strong high pressure in the north, (2) east high–west low (EHWL) pressure, (3) weak high pressure in the north, (4) a weak ridge of high pressure after the trough, (5) a low trough (LT), and (6) strong high pressure. Pattern 2 characterized by the EHWL pressure system, and Pattern 5, featured with LT, was identified as having key synoptic patterns for the beginning and accumulation of pollution processes. Pattern 1, characterized by a strong high pressure in the north, was the cleanest pattern associated with reduced PM2.5 concentrations. The EHWL and LT patterns were associated with a remarkably high cloud liquid content attributed to upper southerly winds introducing humid air. Clouds reduce solar radiation through reflection and scattering, resulting in more stable stratification and aerosol accumulation. This cloud radiation interaction (CRI) was more pronounced in the LT pattern due to denser isobaric lines and stronger southerly winds than in the EHWL pattern. Numerical simulation experiments utilizing WRF-Chem indicated that there is an upper-level heating during afternoon and surface cooling in the morning forced by the aerosol radiation interaction (ARI) under the EHWL and LT patterns. Additionally, strong surface cooling in the evening influenced by valley winds could be found. With wet and cloudy synoptic forcing, ARI directly affects the stability of the boundary layer and is modulated through CRI inhibition. For example, Chongqing exhibited lower PM2.5 concentrations and stronger ARI compared to the western and southern SCB due to lower cloud liquid content and weaker CRI inhibition on the ARI. The CRI inhibition caused a 50 % reduction in solar radiation and boundary layer height during the daytime under the LT pattern, which was larger than that under the EHWL pattern. This study comprehensively analysed the spatial disparities in cloud inhibition on the ARIs, their impacts on the boundary layer structure, and the discrepancies of these interactions under different synoptic patterns during pollution processes.

On-board tests of VOCs from nine cargo ships in China were carried out. Results showed that switching from heavy-fuel oil to diesel increased emission factor VOCs by 48 % on average, enhancing O3 and the secondary organic aerosol formation potential. Thus, implementing a global ultra-low-sulfur oil policy needs to be optimized in the near future. 
 Mandatory use of low-sulfur fuel according to the global sulfur limit regulation has reduced the emissions of SO2 and particulate matter (PM) significantly on ships, and it also leads to a very large uncertainty in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Therefore, an on-board test of VOCs from nine typical cargo ships with low-sulfur fuels in China was carried out in this study. Results showed that the emission factor of VOCs (EFVOCs) varied largely from 0.09 to 3.01 g kg−1 of fuel, with domestic coastal cargo ships (CCSs) having the highest level, followed by inland cargo ships (ICSs) and ocean-going vessels (OGVs). The switch of fuels from heavy fuel oil (HFO) to diesel increased EFVOCs by 48 % on average, which enhanced both O3 and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation potential, especially for OGVs. Besides, the use of low-sulfur fuels for OGVs also led to a significant increase in naphthalene emission. These indicated that the implementation of a global ultra-low-sulfur oil policy in the near future needs to be optimized. Moreover, aromatics were the most important common contributors to O3 and SOA in ship exhausts, which need to be controlled as a matter of priority.

10.5194/acp-24-8983-2024,NO3 reactivity during a summer period in a temperate forest below and above the canopy,"In the scope of a field campaign in a suburban forest near Paris in the summer of 2022, we measured the reactivity of the nitrate radical NO3 towards biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs; e.g. monoterpenes) mainly below but also above the canopy. NO3 reactivity was the highest during nights with strong temperature inversions and decreased strongly with height. Reactions with BVOCs were the main removal process of NO3 throughout the diel cycle below the canopy. 
 We present direct measurements of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC)-induced nitrate radical (NO3) reactivity (kVOC) through the diel cycle in the suburban, temperate forest of Rambouillet near Paris (France). The data were obtained in a 6-week summer period in 2022 as part of the Atmospheric ChemistRy Of the Suburban foreSt (ACROSS) campaign. kVOC was measured in a small (700 m2) clearing mainly at a height of 5.5 m above ground level but also at 40 m (for 5 d and nights). At nighttime, mean values (and 25th–75th percentile ranges) of knightVOC(5.5m) = (0.24-0.06+0.32) s−1 and knightVOC(40m) = (0.016-0.007+0.018) s−1 indicate a significant vertical gradient and low NO3 reactivity above the canopy, whereas knightVOC(5.5 m) showed peak values of up to 2 s−1 close to the ground. The strong vertical gradient in NO3 reactivity could be confirmed by measurements between 0 and 24 m on one particular night characterized by a strong temperature inversion and is a result of the decoupling of air masses aloft from the ground- and canopy-level sources of BVOCs (and nitric oxide, NO). No strong vertical gradient was observed in the mean daytime NO3 reactivity, with kdayVOC(5.5m) = (0.12 ± 0.04) s−1 for the entire campaign and kdayVOC(40m) = (0.07 ± 0.02) s−1 during the 5 d period.Within the clearing, the fractional contribution of VOCs to the total NO3 loss rate coefficient (ktot, determined by photolysis, reaction with NO and VOCs) was 80 %–90 % during the night and ∼ 50 % during the day. In terms of chemical losses of α-pinene below canopy height in the clearing, we find that at nighttime hydroxyl radicals (OH) and ozone (O3) dominate, with NO3 contributing “only” 17 %, which decreases further to 8.5 % during the day. Based on measured OH, measured O3, and calculated NO3 concentrations, the chemical lifetime of BVOCs at noon is about 1 h and is likely to be longer than timescales of transport out of the canopy (typically of the order of minutes), thus significantly reducing the importance of daytime in-canopy processing. Clearly, in forested regions where sufficient nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide (NOx) is available, the role of NO3 and OH as initiators of BVOC oxidation is not strictly limited to nighttime and daytime, respectively, as often implied in e.g. atmospheric chemistry textbooks.",Patrick Dewald;Tobias Seubert;Simone T.

 ​​​​​​​This study compares aerosol mixing-state parameters obtained via simultaneous measurements using DMA–CCNC, H(/V)TDMA, and DMA–SP2, shedding light on the impacts of primary aerosol emissions and secondary aerosol (SA) formation. The analysis reveals significant variations in mixing-state parameters among different techniques, with VTDMA and DMA–SP2 indicating that non-volatile particles mainly stem from black carbon (BC)-containing aerosols, while a substantial proportion of nearly hydrophobic aerosols originates from fossil fuel combustion and biomass-burning emissions. Synthesizing the results, some nearly hydrophobic BC-free particles were found to be cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)-inactive under the measured supersaturated conditions, likely from fossil fuel combustion emissions, while others were CCN-active, linked to biomass-burning emissions. Moreover, BC-containing aerosols emitted from fossil fuel combustion exhibit more external mixing with other aerosol components compared to those from biomass burning. Secondary nitrate and organic aerosol formation significantly affect aerosol mixing states, enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and volatility while reducing heterogeneity among techniques. The study also highlights distinct physical properties of two resolved secondary organic aerosol factors, hinting at their formation through different mechanisms. These findings underscore the importance of comparing aerosol mixing states from different techniques as a tool for understanding aerosol physical properties from different sources and their responses to SA formation, as well as aiding in the exploration of SA formation mechanisms.",Jiangchuan Tao;Biao Luo;Weiqi Xu;Gang Zhao;Hanbin Xu;Biao Xue;Miaomiao Zhai;Wanyun Xu;Huarong Zhao;Sanxue Ren;Guangsheng Zhou;Li Liu;Ye Kuang;Yele Sun,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,TRUE,"['aerosol mixing state', 'CCN', 'hygroscopicity', 'secondary organic aerosol', 'satellite observation', 'air quality monitoring']",该研究利用DMA-CCNC、H(/V)TDMA和DMA-SP2三种技术同步测量气溶胶的物理化学性质，分析了主要排放和二次气溶胶形成对气溶胶混合状态的影响。研究发现，不同技术获得的气溶胶混合状态参数存在显著差异，表明不同来源的气溶胶具有不同的物理性质。研究还发现，二次硝酸盐和有机气溶胶的形成会显著影响气溶胶的混合状态，提高气溶胶的吸湿性和挥发性，降低不同技术之间的异质性。该研究强调了比较不同技术获得的气溶胶混合状态对于理解不同来源的气溶胶物理性质及其对二次气溶胶形成的响应的重要性，并有助于探索二次气溶胶形成机制。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它研究了气溶胶的物理化学性质，这些性质与空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析息息相关。
10.5194/amt-17-4915-2024,A comprehensive evaluation of enhanced temperature influence on gas and aerosol chemistry in the lamp-enclosed oxidation flow reactor (OFR) system,"This study systematically characterizes the temperature enhancement in the lamp-enclosed oxidation flow reactor (OFR). The enhancement varied multiple dimensional factors, emphasizing the complexity of temperature inside of OFR. The effects of temperature on the flow field and gas- or particle-phase reaction inside OFR were also evaluated with experiments and model simulations. Finally, multiple mitigation strategies were demonstrated to minimize this temperature increase. 
 Oxidation flow reactors (OFRs) have been extensively utilized to examine the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). However, the UV lamps typically employed to initiate the photochemistry in OFRs can result in an elevated reactor temperature when their implications are not thoroughly evaluated. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the temperature distribution within an Aerodyne potential aerosol mass OFR (PAM-OFR) and then examined the subsequent effects on flow and chemistry due to lamp heating. A lamp-induced temperature increase was observed, which was a function of lamp-driving voltage, number of lamps, lamp types, OFR residence time, and positions within the PAM-OFR. Under typical PAM-OFR operational conditions (e.g., < 5 d of equivalent atmospheric OH exposure under low-NOx conditions), the temperature increase typically ranged from 1–5 °C. Under extreme (but less frequently encountered) conditions, the heating could reach up to 15 °C. The influences of the increased temperature over ambient conditions on the flow distribution, gas, and condensed-phase chemistry within PAM-OFR were evaluated. Our findings indicate that the increase in temperature altered the flow field, resulting in a diminished tail on the residence time distribution and corresponding oxidant exposure due to faster recirculation. According to simulation results from a radical chemistry box model, the variation in absolute oxidant concentration within PAM-OFR due to temperature increase was minimal (< 5 %). The temperature influences on seed organic aerosol (OA) and newly formed secondary OA were also investigated, suggesting that an increase in temperature can impact the yield, size, and oxidation levels of representative biogenic and anthropogenic SOA types. Recommendations for  temperature-dependent SOA yield corrections and PAM-OFR operating protocols that mitigate lamp-induced temperature enhancement and fluctuations are  presented. We recommend blowing air around the reactor's exterior with fans during PAM-OFR experiments to minimize the temperature increase within  PAM-OFR. Temperature increases are substantially lower for OFRs utilizing less powerful lamps compared to the Aerodyne version.",Tianle Pan;Andrew T.

10.5194/amt-17-4891-2024,ampycloud: an open-source algorithm to determine cloud base heights and sky coverage fractions from ceilometer data,"ampycloud is a new algorithm developed at MeteoSwiss to characterize the height and sky coverage fraction of cloud layers above aerodromes via ceilometer data. This algorithm was devised as part of a larger effort to fully automate the creation of meteorological aerodrome reports (METARs) at Swiss civil airports. The ampycloud algorithm is implemented as a Python package that is made publicly available to the community under the 3-Clause BSD license. 
 Ceilometers are used routinely at aerodromes worldwide to derive the height and sky coverage fraction of cloud layers. This information, possibly combined with direct observations by human observers, contributes to the production of meteorological aerodrome reports (METARs). Here, we present ampycloud, a new algorithm, and its associated Python package for automatic processing of ceilometer data with the aim of determining the sky coverage fraction and base height of cloud layers above aerodromes. The ampycloud algorithm was developed at the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss) as part of the AMAROC (AutoMETAR/AutoReport rOund the Clock) program to help in the fully automatic production of METARs at Swiss civil aerodromes. ampycloud is designed to work with no direct human supervision. The algorithm consists of three distinct, sequential steps that rely on agglomerative clustering methods and Gaussian mixture models to identify distinct cloud layers from individual cloud base hits reported by ceilometers. The robustness of the ampycloud algorithm stems from the first processing step, which is simple and reliable. It constrains the two subsequent processing steps that are more sensitive but also better suited to handling complex cloud distributions.

10.5194/amt-17-4941-2024,High-resolution wind speed measurements with quadcopter uncrewed aerial systems: calibration and verification in a wind tunnel with an active grid,"We use a fleet of multicopter drones to measure wind. To improve the accuracy of this wind measurement and to evaluate this improvement, we conducted experiments with the drones in a wind tunnel under various conditions. This wind tunnel can generate different kinds and intensities of wind. Here we measured with the drones and with other sensors as a reference and compared the results. We were able to improve our wind measurement and show how accurately it works in different situations. 
 As a contribution to closing observational gaps in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), the Simultaneous Wind measurement with Uncrewed Flight Systems in 3D (SWUF-3D) fleet of uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) is utilized for in situ measurements of turbulence. To date, the coefficients for the transformation terms used in our algorithm for deriving wind speeds from avionic data have only been determined via calibration flights in the free field. Therefore, we present in this work calibration and verification under laboratory conditions. The UAS measurements are performed in a wind tunnel equipped with an active grid and constant temperature anemometers (CTAs) as a reference. Calibration is performed in x- and y-coordinate directions of the UAS body frame at wind speeds of 2 … 18 m s−1. For systematic verification of the measurement capabilities and identification of limitations, different measurement scenarios like gusts, velocity steps, and turbulence are generated with the active grid. Furthermore, the measurement accuracy under different angles of sideslip (AoSs) and wind speeds is investigated, and we examined whether the calibration coefficients can be ported to other UASs in the fleet. Our analyses show that the uncertainty in measuring the wind speed depends on the wind speed magnitude and increases with extreme velocity changes and with higher wind speeds, resulting in a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 0.2 m s−1 for steady wind speeds. Applying the calibration coefficients from one UAS to others within the fleet results in comparable accuracies. Flights in gusts of different strengths yield an RMSE of up to 0.6 m s−1. The maximal RMSE occurs in the most extreme velocity steps (i.e., a lower speed of 5 m s−1 and an amplitude of 10 m s−1) and exceeds 1.3 m s−1. For variances below approx. 0.5 and 0.3 m2 s−2, the maximal resolvable frequencies of the turbulence are about 2 and 1 Hz, respectively. The results indicate successful calibration but with susceptibility to high AoSs in high wind speeds, no necessity for wind tunnel calibration for individual UASs, and the need for further research regarding turbulence analysis.",Johannes Kistner;Lars Neuhaus;Norman Wildmann,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,TRUE,"['wind speed', 'turbulence', 'uncrewed aerial systems', 'atmospheric boundary layer', 'calibration', 'verification']",这篇论文研究了利用无人机机群测量风速，并对该方法进行了校准和验证。研究人员在风洞中使用主动格栅模拟不同风速和湍流条件，并使用无人机和传统风速传感器进行测量。结果表明，该方法在稳定风速条件下能够达到较高的精度，但在高风速和剧烈变化的风速条件下精度会下降。这项研究对大气边界层风速和湍流的观测具有重要意义，并为无人机在气象观测中的应用提供了参考。
10.5194/amt-2024-141,Retrieving cloud base height and geometric thickness using the oxygen A-band channel of GCOM-C/SGLI,"In satellite remote sensing, estimating cloud base height (CBH) is more challenging than estimating cloud top height because the cloud base is obscured by the cloud itself. We developed an algorithm using the specific channel (known as the oxygen A-band channel) of the SGLI instrument on JAXA’s GCOM-C satellite to estimate CBH together with other cloud properties. This algorithm can provide global distributions of CBH across various cloud types, including liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds. 
 Measurements with a 763 nm channel, located within the oxygen A-band and equipped on the Second-generation Global Imager (SGLI) onboard the JAXA’s Global Change Observation Mission – Climate (GCOM-C) satellite, have the potential to retrieve cloud base height (CBH) and cloud geometric thickness (CGT) through passive remote sensing. This study implemented an algorithm to retrieve the CBH using the SGLI 763 nm channel in combination with several other SGLI channels in the visible, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared regions. In addition to CBH, the algorithm can simultaneously retrieve other key cloud properties, including cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius, ice COT fraction as the cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud top height (CTH), and CGT. Moreover, the algorithm can be seamlessly applied to global clouds comprised of liquid, ice, and mixed phases. The SGLI-retrieved CBH exhibited quantitative consistency with CBH data obtained from the ground-based ceilometer network, ship-borne ceilometer, satellite-borne radar and lidar observations, as evidenced by sufficiently high correlations and small biases. These results provide practical evidence that the retrieval of CBH is indeed possible using the SGLI 763 nm channel. Moreover, the results lend credence to the future use of SGLI CBH data, including the estimation of the surface downward longwave radiative flux from clouds. Nevertheless, issues remain that must be addressed to enhance the value of SGLI-derived cloud retrieval products. These include the systematic bias of SGLI CTH related to cirrus clouds and the bias of SGLI CBH caused by multi-layer clouds.",Takashi M.

10.5194/amt-17-4863-2024,High-altitude balloon-launched uncrewed aircraft system measurements of atmospheric turbulence and qualitative comparison with infrasound microphone response,"This work summarizes measurements conducted in June 2021 using a small, uncrewed, stratospheric glider that was launched from a weather balloon to altitudes up to 30 km above sea level. The aircraft conducted measurements of wind speed and direction, pressure, temperature, and humidity during its descent as well as measurements of infrasonic sound levels. These data were used to evaluate the atmospheric turbulence observed during the descent phase of the flight. 
 This study investigates the use of a balloon-launched uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) for the measurement of turbulence in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. The UAS was a glider which could conduct an automated descent following a designated flight trajectory and was equipped with in situ sensors for measuring thermodynamic and kinematic atmospheric properties. In addition, this aircraft was equipped with an infrasonic microphone to assess its suitability for the remote detection of clear-air turbulence. The capabilities of the UAS and sensing systems were tested during three flights conducted in New Mexico, USA, in 2021. It was found that the profiles of temperature, humidity, and horizontal winds measured during descent were in broad agreement with those made by radiosonde data published by the US National Weather Service, separated by up to 380 km spatially and by 3 to 5 h temporally. Winds measured during controlled flight descent were consistent with the winds measured by global-positioning-system-derived velocity during balloon ascent. During controlled descent with this particular payload, a nominal vertical resolution on the order of 1 m was achieved for temperature, relative humidity, and pressure with a nominal vertical resolution of the wind velocity vector on the order of 0.1 m; the aircraft had a glide slope angle from 1 to 4° during this time. Analysis approaches were developed that provided turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate, but it was found that the corresponding Richardson number was sensitive to the methodology used to determine the vertical gradients from a single flight. The low-frequency content of the infrasonic microphone signal was observed to qualitatively align with long-wavelength wind velocity fluctuations detected at high altitude. Moreover, the microphone measured more broadband frequency content when the aircraft approached turbulence produced by the boundary layer.",Anisa N. Haghighi;Ryan D. Nolin;Gary D.

10.5194/amt-2024-142,Estimating hourly ground-level aerosols using GEMS aerosol optical depth: A machine learning approach,"Air pollutants such as PM10 or PM2.5 can cause adverse public health and environment effects, therefore their regular monitoring is crucial to keep the pollutant concentrations under control. Our study demonstrates the potential of high-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) satellite to estimate ground-level PM concentrations using a machine learning model. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is the world's first ultraviolet–visible instrument for air quality monitoring in geostationary orbit. Since its launch in 2020, GEMS has provided hourly daytime air quality information over Asia. However, to date, validation and applications of these data are lacking. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of the first 1.5-year GEMS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data in estimating ground-level particulate matter (PM) concentrations at an hourly scale. To do so, we employ random forest models and use GEMS AOD data and meteorological variables as input features to estimate PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, respectively, in South Korea. The model-estimated PM concentrations are strongly correlated with ground measurements, but they exhibit negative biases, particularly during high aerosol loading months. Our results indicate that GEMS AOD values represent underestimates compared to ground-measured AOD values, possibly leading to negative biases in the final PM estimates. Further, we demonstrate that more training data could significantly improve random forest model performance, thus indicating the potential of GEMS for high-resolution surface PM prediction when sufficient data are accumulated over the coming years. Our results will serve as a reference to aid the evaluation of future GEMS AOD retrieval algorithm improvements and also provide initial guidance for data users.",Sungmin O;Ji Won Yoon;Seon Ki Park,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques Discussions,TRUE,"['aerosol optical depth', 'GEMS', 'PM2.5', 'PM10', 'air quality monitoring', 'machine learning', 'satellite observation']",该研究利用地球静止环境监测光谱仪（GEMS）卫星获取的较高分辨率气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）数据，结合机器学习模型，对韩国地区的PM10和PM2.5浓度进行小时尺度的估算。研究表明，GEMS AOD数据与地面测量结果具有较强相关性，但存在负偏差，特别是在气溶胶负荷较高的月份。研究结果表明，GEMS AOD数据可能低估了地面测量的AOD值，导致最终的PM估算结果存在负偏差。此外，研究表明，更多训练数据可以显著提高随机森林模型的性能，表明GEMS在未来几年积累足够数据后，有潜力进行高分辨率的地表PM预测。研究结果可为评估未来GEMS AOD反演算法的改进提供参考，并为数据用户提供初步指导。
10.5194/amt-17-4843-2024,Partition between supercooled liquid droplets and ice crystals in mixed-phase clouds based on airborne in situ observations,"The partition between supercooled liquid water and ice crystals in mixed-phase clouds is investigated using aircraft-based in situ observations over the Southern Ocean. A novel method is developed to define four phases of mixed-phase clouds. Relationships between cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties are quantified. Effects of aerosols and thermodynamic and dynamical conditions on ice nucleation and phase partitioning are examined. 
 The onset of ice nucleation in mixed-phase clouds determines the lifetime and microphysical properties of ice clouds. In this work, we develop a novel method that differentiates between various phases of mixed-phase clouds, such as clouds dominated by pure liquid or pure ice segments, compared with those having ice crystals surrounded by supercooled liquid water droplets or vice versa. Using this method, we examine the relationship between the macrophysical and microphysical properties of Southern Ocean mixed-phase clouds at −40 to 0 °C (e.g. stratiform and cumuliform clouds) based on the in situ aircraft-based observations during the US National Science Foundation Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) flight campaign. The results show that the exchange between supercooled liquid water and ice crystals from a macrophysical perspective, represented by the increasing spatial ratio of regions containing ice crystals relative to the total in-cloud region (defined as ice spatial ratio), is positively correlated with the phase exchange from a microphysical perspective, represented by the increasing ice water content (IWC), decreasing liquid water content (LWC), increasing ice mass fraction, and increasing ice particle number fraction (IPNF). The mass exchange between liquid and ice becomes more significant during phase 3 when pure ice cloud regions (ICRs) start to appear. Occurrence frequencies of cloud thermodynamic phases show a significant phase change from liquid to ice at a similar temperature (i.e. −17.5 °C) among three types of definitions of mixed-phase clouds based on ice spatial ratio, ice mass fraction, or IPNF. Aerosol indirect effects are quantified for different phases using number concentrations of aerosols greater than 100 or 500 nm (N>100 and N>500, respectively). N>500 shows stronger positive correlations with ice spatial ratios compared with N>100. This result indicates that larger aerosols potentially contain ice-nucleating particles (INPs), which facilitate the formation of ice crystals in mixed-phase clouds. The impact of N>500 is also more significant in phase 2 when ice crystals just start to appear in the mixed phase compared with phase 3 when pure ICRs have formed, possibly due to the competing aerosol indirect effects on primary and secondary ice production in phase 3. The thermodynamic and dynamic conditions are quantified for each phase. The results show stronger in-cloud turbulence and higher updraughts in phases 2 and 3 when liquid and ice coexist compared with pure liquid or ice (phases 1 and 4, respectively). The highest updraughts and turbulence are seen in phase 3 when supercooled liquid droplets are surrounded by ice crystals. These results indicate both updraughts and turbulence support the maintenance of supercooled liquid water amongst ice crystals. Overall, these results illustrate the varying effects of aerosols, thermodynamics, and dynamics through various stages of mixed-phase cloud evolution based on this new method that categorizes cloud phases.",Flor Vanessa Maciel;Minghui Diao;Ching An Yang,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,TRUE,"['cloud microphysics', 'aerosol', 'ice nucleation', 'aircraft observations', 'mixed-phase clouds']",该研究利用飞机搭载的仪器对南大洋混合相云进行了观测，通过分析云的宏观物理和微观物理性质，研究了超冷液态水和冰晶之间的分配关系。研究发现，冰核的形成影响着冰云的寿命和微观物理性质，并分析了气溶胶、热力学和动力学条件对冰核形成和相分配的影响。研究结果表明，气溶胶对混合相云的冰核形成起着重要作用，更大的气溶胶可能包含冰核粒子，促进冰晶的形成。此外，研究还发现，上升气流和湍流有利于超冷液态水在冰晶中维持。该研究为理解混合相云的演化过程提供了新的见解，并对大气环境遥感技术，特别是云物理和气溶胶研究具有重要意义。
10.5194/amt-17-4803-2024,Atmospheric H2 observations from the NOAA Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network,"Hydrogen (H2) is a gas in trace amounts in the Earth’s atmosphere with indirect impacts on climate and air quality. Renewed interest in H2 as a low- or zero-carbon source of energy may lead to increased production, uses, and supply chain emissions. NOAA measurements of weekly air samples collected between 2009 and 2021 at over 50 sites in mostly remote locations are now available, and they complement other datasets to study the H2 global budget. 
 The NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) measures atmospheric hydrogen (H2) in grab samples collected weekly as flask pairs at over 50 sites in the Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network. Measurements representative of background air sampling show higher H2 in recent years at all latitudes. The marine boundary layer (MBL) global mean H2 was 552.8 ppb in 2021, 20.2 ± 0.2 ppb higher compared to 2010. A 10 ppb or more increase over the 2010–2021 average annual cycle was detected in 2016 for MBL zonal means in the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere. Carbon monoxide measurements in the same-air samples suggest large biomass burning events in different regions likely contributed to the observed interannual variability at different latitudes. The NOAA H2 measurements from 2009 to 2021 are now based on the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmospheric Watch (WMO GAW) H2 mole fraction calibration scale, developed and maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC), Jena, Germany. GML maintains eight H2 primary calibration standards to propagate the WMO scale. These are gravimetric hydrogen-in-air mixtures in electropolished stainless steel cylinders (Essex Industries, St. Louis, MO), which are stable for H2. These mixtures were calibrated at the MPI-BGC, the WMO Central Calibration Laboratory (CCL) for H2, in late 2020 and span the range 250–700 ppb. We have used the CCL assignments to propagate the WMO H2 calibration scale to NOAA air measurements performed using gas chromatography and helium pulse discharge detector instruments since 2009. To propagate the scale, NOAA uses a hierarchy of secondary and tertiary standards, which consist of high-pressure whole-air mixtures in aluminum cylinders, calibrated against the primary and secondary standards, respectively. Hydrogen at the parts per billion level has a tendency to increase in aluminum cylinders over time. We fit the calibration histories of these standards with zero-, first-, or second-order polynomial functions of time and use the time-dependent mole fraction assignments on the WMO scale to reprocess all tank air and flask air H2 measurement records. The robustness of the scale propagation over multiple years is evaluated with the regular analysis of target air cylinders and with long-term same-air measurement comparison efforts with WMO GAW partner laboratories. Long-term calibrated, globally distributed, and freely accessible measurements of H2 and other gases and isotopes continue to be essential to track and interpret regional and global changes in the atmosphere composition. The adoption of the WMO H2 calibration scale and subsequent reprocessing of NOAA atmospheric data constitute a significant improvement in the NOAA H2 measurement records.",Gabrielle Pétron;Andrew M.

10.5194/amt-17-4825-2024,Simulation and detection efficiency analysis for measurements of polar mesospheric clouds using a spaceborne wide-field-of-view ultraviolet imager,"Ultraviolet imaging technology has significantly advanced the research and development of polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs). In this study, we proposed the wide-field-of-view ultraviolet imager (WFUI) and built a forward model to evaluate the detection capability and efficiency. The results demonstrate that the WFUI performs well in PMC detection and has high detection efficiency. The relationship between ice water content and detection efficiency follows an exponential function distribution. 
 The variation trends and characteristics of polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) are important for studying the evolution of atmospheric systems and understanding various atmospheric dynamic processes. Through observation and analysis of PMCs, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving atmospheric processes, providing a scientific basis and support for addressing climate change. Ultraviolet (UV) imaging technology, adopted by the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite, has significantly advanced the research on PMCs. Due to the retirement of the AIM satellite, there is currently no concrete plan for next-generation instruments based on the CIPS model, resulting in a discontinuity in the observation data sequence.In this study, we propose a compact and cost-effective wide-field-of-view ultraviolet imager (WFUI) that can be integrated into various satellite platforms for future PMC observation missions. A forward model was built to evaluate the detection capability and efficiency of the WFUI. CIPS and Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) data were fused to reconstruct a three-dimensional PMC scene as the input background. Based on the scattering and extinction characteristics of ice particles and atmospheric molecules, the radiative transfer was calculated using the solar radiation path through the atmosphere and PMCs. The optical system and satellite platform parameters of the WFUI were selected according to CIPS, enabling the calculation of the number of photons received by the WFUI. The actual detection signal is then simulated by photoelectric conversion, and the PMC information can be obtained by removing detector noise. Subsequently, a comparison with the input background field was conducted to compute and analyze the detection efficiency. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the instrument and platform parameters was conducted.Simulations were performed for both individual orbits and for the entire PMC seasons. The research results demonstrate that the WFUI performs well in PMC detection and has high detection efficiency. Statistical analysis of the detection efficiency using data from 2008 to 2012 revealed an exponential relationship between the ice water content (IWC) of PMCs and detection efficiency. During the initial and final durations of the PMC season, when the IWC was relatively low, the detection efficiency remained limited. However, as the season progressed and the IWC increased, the detection efficiency significantly improved. We note that regions at lower latitudes exhibited a lower IWC and, consequently, lower detection efficiency. In contrast, regions at higher latitudes, with a greater IWC, demonstrated better detection efficiency. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis results suggest that increasing the satellite orbit altitude and expanding the field of view (FOV) of the WFUI both contribute to improving the detection efficiency.",Ke Ren;Haiyang Gao;Shuqi Niu;Shaoyang Sun;Leilei Kou;Yanqing Xie;Liguo Zhang;Lingbing Bu,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,TRUE,"['polar mesospheric clouds', 'UV imaging', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition', 'detection efficiency']",该研究论文重点关注利用空间宽视场紫外成像仪（WFUI）观测极地中层云（PMCs）的技术。论文介绍了WFUI的设计原理和检测能力，并通过模拟分析了其检测效率。研究发现，WFUI能够有效地检测PMCs，并且检测效率与冰水含量呈指数关系。该研究对理解极地中层云的演变和大气动力学过程具有重要意义，也为未来利用卫星观测技术监测大气环境提供了新的思路。
10.5194/amt-2024-117,Mitigating Radome Induced Bias in X-Band Weather Radar Polarimetric moments using Adaptive DFT Algorithm,"This study explores how the joints in a weather radar's protective cover affect its measurements. We developed a new method to correct these errors, improving the accuracy of the radar's data. Our method was tested during an intense cyclone on Reunion Island, demonstrating significant improvements in data accuracy. This research is crucial for enhancing weather predictions and understanding, particularly in challenging terrains. 
 In recent years, the application of compact and cost-effective deployable X-band polarimetric radars has gained in popularity, particularly in regions with complex terrain. The deployable radars generally use a radome constructed by joining multiple panels using metallic threads to facilitate easy transportation. As a part of the ESPOIRS project, Laboratoire de l’Atmosphère et des Cyclones has acquired an X-band meteorological radar with four panel radome configuration. In this study, we investigated the effect of the radome on the measured polarimetric variables, particularly differential reflectivity and differential phase.

A total of eight potentially unique events are analyzed, considering both the number and size of raindrops. However, no clear evidence supporting the existence of a special rainfall regime could be found. The results highlight the challenges in experimentally confirming well-established theoretical ideas in the field of precipitation sciences. 
 An experimental study aimed at identifying special rainfall regimes with the help of co-located disdrometers is performed. Eight potentially special events (i.e., four number-controlled events and four size-controlled events) are identified and examined. However, a detailed cross-check with additional, independent radar measurements reveals no clear evidence of special rainfall dynamics. The research underscores the difficulty of experimentally confirming seemingly straightforward questions about rainfall patterns and dynamics that have been theorized in the literature for several decades but never formally validated experimentally.

FINESSE combines a commercial instrument with custom-built optics to view a surface from different angles with complementary views of the sky. Its choice of internal components means it can cover a wide range of wavelengths, extending into the far-infrared.

We demonstrate our method by making measurements of the emissivity of water. We then compare our results to the emissivity predicted using a model and find good agreement. The observations from FINESSE are novel because they allow us to determine surface emissivity at longer wavelengths than have been routinely measured before. 
 In this paper, we describe a method for retrieving the surface emissivity of specular surfaces across the wavenumber range of 400–1600 cm−1 using novel radiance measurements of the Far-INfrarEd Spectrometer for Surface Emissivity (FINESSE) instrument. FINESSE is described in detail in Part 1 (Murray et al., 2024) of this paper. We apply the method to two sets of measurements of distilled water. The first set of emissivity retrievals is of distilled water heated above ambient temperature to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The second set of emissivity retrievals is of ambient temperate water at a range of viewing angles. In both cases, the observations agree well with calculations based on compiled refractive indices across the mid- and far-infrared. It is found that the reduced contrast between the up- and downwelling radiation in the ambient temperature case degrades the performance of the retrieval. Therefore, a filter is developed to target regions of high contrast, which improves the agreement between the ambient temperature emissivity retrieval and the predicted emissivity. These retrievals are, to the best of our knowledge, the first published simultaneous retrievals of the surface temperature and emissivity of water that extend into the far-infrared and demonstrate a method that can be used and further developed for the in situ retrieval of the emissivity of other surfaces in the field.",Laura Warwick;Jonathan E.

10.5194/amt-17-4737-2024,Global sensitivity analysis of simulated remote sensing polarimetric observations over snow,"We analyze simulated polarization observations over snow to investigate the capabilities of remote sensing to determine surface and atmospheric properties in snow-covered regions. Polarization measurements are demonstrated to aid in the determination of snow grain shape, ice crystal roughness, and the vertical distribution of impurities in the snow–atmosphere system, data that are critical for estimating snow albedo for use in climate models. 
 This study presents a detailed theoretical assessment of the information content of passive polarimetric observations over snow scenes, using a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method. Conventional sensitivity studies focus on varying a single parameter while keeping all other parameters fixed. In contrast, the GSA correctly addresses the covariance of state parameters across their entire parameter space, hence favoring a more correct interpretation of inversion algorithms and the optimal design of their state vectors.The forward simulations exploit a vector radiative transfer model to obtain the Stokes vector emerging at the top of the atmosphere for different solar zenith angles, when the bottom boundary consists of a vertically resolved snowpack of non-spherical grains. The presence of light-absorbing particulates (LAPs), either embedded in the snow or aloft in the atmosphere above in the form of aerosols, is also considered. The results are presented for a set of wavelengths spanning the visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the spectrum.The GSA correctly captures the expected, high sensitivity of the reflectance to LAPs in the VIS–NIR and to grain size at different depths in the snowpack in the NIR–SWIR. With adequate viewing geometries, mono-angle measurements of total reflectance in the VIS–SWIR (akin to those of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) resolve grain size in the top layer of the snowpack sufficiently well. The addition of multi-angle polarimetric observations in the VIS–NIR provides information on grain shape and microscale roughness. The simultaneous sensitivity in the VIS–NIR to both aerosols and snow-embedded impurities can be disentangled by extending the spectral range to the SWIR, which contains information on aerosol optical depth while remaining essentially unaffected when the same particulates are mixed with the snow. Multi-angle polarimetric observations can therefore (i) effectively partition LAPs between the atmosphere and the surface, which represents a notorious challenge for snow remote sensing based on measurements of total reflectance only and (ii) lead to better estimates of grain shape and roughness and, in turn, the asymmetry parameter, which is critical for the determination of albedo. The retrieval uncertainties are minimized when the degree of linear polarization is used in place of the polarized reflectance.The Sobol indices, which are the main metric for the GSA, were used to select the state parameters in retrievals performed on data simulated for multiple instrument configurations. Improvements in retrieval quality with the addition of measurements of polarization, multi-angle views, and different spectral channels reflect the information content, identified by the Sobol indices, relative to each configuration.The results encourage the development of new remote sensing algorithms that fully leverage multi-angle and polarimetric capabilities of modern remote sensors. They can also aid flight planning activities, since the optimal exploitation of the information content of multi-angle measurements depends on the viewing geometry. The better characterization of surface and atmospheric parameters in snow-covered regions advances  research opportunities for scientists of the cryosphere and ultimately benefits albedo estimates in climate models.",Matteo Ottaviani;Gabriel Harris Myers;Nan Chen,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,TRUE,"['snow albedo', 'polarimetric observations', 'remote sensing', 'MODIS', 'climate models']",这篇论文研究了利用偏振遥感技术来探测积雪覆盖区域的表面和大气特性，并分析了不同观测参数对雪反照率的影响。研究使用了一个矢量辐射传输模型来模拟不同太阳天顶角下，包含非球形雪粒和大气气溶胶的积雪场景的偏振观测结果。通过全局敏感性分析方法，论文发现偏振观测可以有效地识别雪粒形状、微观粗糙度以及大气气溶胶和雪中杂质的分布情况。这些信息对于准确估算雪反照率至关重要，而雪反照率是气候模型中的关键参数。论文还建议未来开发利用多角度和偏振观测能力的遥感算法，以更好地理解积雪覆盖区域的表面和大气特性，并提高气候模型中的雪反照率估算精度。
10.5194/amt-17-4725-2024,Drone CO2 measurements during the Tajogaite volcanic eruption,"Volcanic eruptions emit significant quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. We present a new method for directly determining the CO2 emission from a volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma, Spain, using an unpiloted aerial vehicle (UAV). We also collected samples of the emitted CO2 and analyzed their isotopic composition. Together with the emission rate the isotopic data provide valuable information on the state of volcanic activity and the potential evolution of the eruption. 
 We report in-plume carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and carbon isotope ratios during the 2021 eruption of Tajogaite volcano, island of La Palma, Spain. CO2 measurements inform our understanding of volcanic contributions to the global climate carbon cycle and the role of CO2 in eruptions. Traditional ground-based methods of CO2 collection are difficult and dangerous, and as a result only about 5 % of volcanoes have been directly surveyed. We demonstrate that unpiloted aerial system (UAS) surveys allow for fast and relatively safe measurements. Using CO2 concentration profiles we estimate the total flux during several measurements in November 2021 to be 1.76±0.20×103 to 2.23±0.26×104 t d−1.

10.5194/amt-2024-130,Impact and Optimization of Calibration Conditions for Air Quality Sensors in the Long-term Field Monitoring,"Long-term field testing across diverse climatic environments is conducted to identify the optimized calibration conditions for NO2, NO, CO, and O3 electrochemical sensors. The results uncovered three factors that influence calibration performance: calibration period, concentration range, and time averaging. We developed a comprehensive framework for the best sensor calibration practices, which serves as a valuable reference for calibrating various sensor types used in air quality monitoring. 
 The rapid expansion of low-cost sensor networks for air quality monitoring necessitates rigorous calibration to ensure data accuracy. Despite numerous published field calibration studies, a universal and comprehensive assessment of factors affecting sensor calibration remains elusive, leading to potential discrepancies in data quality across different networks. To address these challenges, this study deployed eight sensor-based monitors equipped with electrochemical sensors for NO2, NO, CO, and O3 measurement in strategically chosen locations within Hong Kong, Macau, and Shanghai, covering a wide range of climatic conditions: Hong Kong's subtropical climate, Macau's similar yet distinct urban environment, and Shanghai's more variable climate. This strategic deployment ensured that the sensors' performance and calibration processes were tested across diverse atmospheric conditions. Each monitor employed a patented dynamic baseline tracking method for the gas sensors, which isolates the concentration signals from temperature and humidity effects, enhancing the sensors' accuracy and reliability. The tests, which involved evaluating the validation performance by analyzing randomly selected calibration sample subsets ranging from 1 to 15 days, indicated that the length of the calibration period, pollutant concentration range, and time averaging period are pivotal for sensor calibration quality. We determined that a 5–7 days calibration period minimizes calibration coefficient errors, and a wider concentration range improves the validation R2 values for all sensors, suggesting the necessity of setting specific concentration range thresholds. Moreover, a time averaging period of at least 5 minutes for data with 1-minute resolution was recommended to enable optimal calibration in field operation. This study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive calibration assessment and the importance of considering environmental variability in sensor calibration condition. These findings offer methodological guidance for the calibration of other sensor types, providing a reference for future research in the field of sensor calibration.",Han Mei;Peng Wei;Meisam Ahmadi Ghadikolaei;Nirmal Kumar Gali;Ya Wang;Zhi Ning,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques Discussions,TRUE,"['air quality monitoring', 'electrochemical sensors', 'NO2', 'NO', 'CO', 'O3', 'calibration', 'field testing', 'long-term monitoring']",这篇论文研究了空气质量传感器在长期野外监测中的校准条件的影响和优化。研究人员使用电化学传感器对NO2、NO、CO和O3进行了长期野外测试，并分析了校准周期、浓度范围和时间平均等因素对校准性能的影响。研究结果表明，适当的校准周期、浓度范围和时间平均可以提高传感器校准的准确性和可靠性。该研究为空气质量监测中各种传感器类型的校准提供了宝贵的参考，并强调了在传感器校准过程中考虑环境变化的重要性。
10.5194/amt-17-4675-2024,Improving the Gaussianity of radar reflectivity departures between observations and simulations using symmetric rain rates,"A symmetric error model built by symmetric rain rates handles the non-Gaussian error structure of the reflectivity error. The accuracy and linearization of rain rates can further improve the Gaussianity. 
 Given that the Gaussianity of the observation error distribution is the fundamental principle of some data assimilation and machine learning algorithms, the error structure of radar reflectivity has become increasingly important with the development of high-resolution forecasts and nowcasts of convective systems. This study examines the error distribution of radar reflectivity and discusses what causes the non-Gaussian error distribution using 6-month observations minus backgrounds (OmBs) of composites of vertical maximum reflectivity (CVMRs) in mountainous and hilly areas. By following the symmetric error model in all-sky satellite radiance assimilation, we reveal the error structure of CVMRs as a function of symmetric rain rates, which is the average of the observed and simulated rain rates. Unlike satellite radiance, the error structure of CVMRs shows a sharper slope for light precipitation than for moderate precipitation. Thus, a three-piecewise fitting function is more suitable for CVMRs. The probability density functions of OmBs normalized by symmetric rain rates become more Gaussian than the probability density functions normalized by all samples. Moreover, the possibility of using a third-party predictor to construct the symmetric error model is also discussed in this study. The result shows that the Gaussian distribution of OmBs can be further improved via more accurate precipitation observations. According to the Jensen–Shannon divergence, a more linear predictor, the logarithmic transformation of the rain rate, can provide the most Gaussian error distribution in comparison with other predictors.",Yudong Gao;Lidou Huyan;Zheng Wu;Bojun Liu,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,TRUE,"['radar reflectivity', 'precipitation', 'data assimilation', 'machine learning', 'nowcasting']",这篇论文研究了雷达反射率误差的非高斯分布问题，并提出了一种基于对称降雨率的误差模型来改善误差分布的正态性。该研究利用山区和丘陵地区的垂直最大反射率（CVMR）的观测值减去背景值（OmBs）来分析误差分布，并发现CVMR的误差结构与对称降雨率有关。论文还探讨了使用第三方预测器来构建对称误差模型的可能性，并发现对降雨率进行对数变换可以获得最接近高斯分布的误差分布。这项研究对于提高雷达数据同化和机器学习算法的精度具有重要意义，并有助于提高对流系统的预报和临近预报的准确性。
10.5194/amt-17-4709-2024,A nitrate ion chemical-ionization atmospheric-pressure-interface time-of-flight mass spectrometer (NO3− ToFCIMS) sensitivity study,"Calibration exercises are essential for determining the accuracy of instruments. We performed calibrations on a NO3¯ ToFCIMS instrument to determine its sensitivity and linearity for detecting various organic compounds. Our findings revealed significant variability, over several orders of magnitude, in the calibration factors obtained. The results suggest that relying on a single calibration factor from H2SO4 for the quantification of all compounds detected by this technique is not appropriate. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a key role in tropospheric chemistry, giving rise to secondary products such as highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). HOMs, a group of low-volatility gas-phase products, are formed through the autoxidation process of peroxy radicals (RO2) originating from the oxidation of VOCs. The measurement of HOMs is made by a NO3- ToFCIMS instrument, which also detects other species like small highly oxygenated VOCs (e.g., dicarboxylic acids) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The instrument response to HOMs is typically estimated using H2SO4, as HOMs are neither commercially available nor easily synthesized in the laboratory. The resulting calibration factor is then applied to quantify all species detected using this technique. In this study, we explore the sensitivity of the instrument to commercially available small organic compounds, primarily dicarboxylic acids, given the limitations associated with producing known amounts of HOMs for calibration. We compare these single-compound calibration factors to the one obtained for H2SO4 under identical operational conditions. The study found that the sensitivity of the NO3- ToFCIMS varies depending on the specific type of organic compound, illustrating how a single calibration factor derived from sulfuric acid is clearly inadequate for quantifying all detected species using this technique. The results highlighted substantial variability in the calibration factors for the tested organic compounds, with 4-nitrocatechol exhibiting the highest sensitivity and pyruvic acid the lowest. The obtained sulfuric acid calibration factor agreed well with the previous values from the literature. In summary, this research emphasized the need to develop reliable and precise calibration methods for progressively oxygenated reaction products measured with a NO3- chemical-ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS), for example, HOMs.",Stéphanie Alage;Vincent Michoud;Sergio Harb;Bénédicte Picquet-Varrault;Manuela Cirtog;Avinash Kumar;Matti Rissanen;Christopher Cantrell,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,TRUE,"['atmospheric composition', 'VOCs', 'HOMs', 'NO3- ToFCIMS', 'air quality monitoring']",该研究主要关注大气环境遥感技术中的气体成分分析。文章以NO3- ToFCIMS仪器为研究对象，通过校准实验，研究了该仪器对不同有机化合物的灵敏度。结果表明，该仪器对不同有机化合物的灵敏度存在显著差异，说明用硫酸的校准因子来量化所有检测到的化合物是不合适的。研究还发现，该仪器对小分子有机化合物（如二羧酸）的灵敏度与硫酸的灵敏度存在差异。这项研究强调了开发可靠的校准方法的重要性，以便更准确地测量大气中挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）的氧化产物，例如高度氧化有机分子（HOMs）。

The study is carried out through spectroscopy simulations. 
 We assess the temperature stability requirements of unseeded Nd:YAG lasers in lidar systems for atmospheric temperature profiling through the rotational Raman technique. Taking as a reference a system using a seeded laser assumed to emit pulses of negligible spectral width and free of wavelength drifts, we estimate first the effect of the pulse spectral widening of the unseeded laser on the output of the interference filters, and then we derive the limits of the allowable wavelength drift for a given bias in the temperature measurement that would add to the noise-induced uncertainty. Finally, using spectroscopic data, we relate the allowable wavelength drift to allowable temperature variations in the YAG rod.

10.5194/essd-16-3795-2024,Generation of global 1 km all-weather instantaneous and daily mean land surface temperatures from MODIS data,"This study describes 1 km all-weather instantaneous and daily mean land surface temperature (LST) datasets on the global scale during 2000–2020. It is the first attempt to synergistically estimate all-weather instantaneous and daily mean LST data on a long  global-scale time series. The generated datasets were evaluated by the observations from in situ stations and other LST datasets, and the evaluation indicated that the dataset is sufficiently reliable. 
 Land surface temperature (LST) serves as a crucial variable in characterizing climatological, agricultural, ecological, and hydrological processes. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing provides high temporal and spatial resolutions for obtaining LST information. Nevertheless, TIR-based satellite LST products frequently exhibit missing values due to cloud interference. Prior research on estimating all-weather instantaneous LST has predominantly concentrated on regional or continental scales. This study involved generating a global all-weather instantaneous and daily mean LST product spanning from 2000 to 2020 using XGBoost. Multisource data, including Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations, surface radiation products, and reanalysis data, were employed. Validation using an independent dataset of 77 individual stations demonstrated the high accuracy of our products, yielding root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.787 K (instantaneous) and 2.175 K (daily). The RMSE for clear-sky conditions was 2.614 K for the instantaneous product, which is slightly lower than the cloudy-sky RMSE of 2.931 K. Our instantaneous and daily mean LST products exhibit higher accuracy compared to the MODIS official LST product (instantaneous RMSE = 3.583 K; daily 3.105 K) and the land component of the fifth generation of the European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) LST product (instantaneous RMSE = 4.048 K; daily 2.988 K). Significant improvements are observed in our LST product, notably at high latitudes, compared to the official MODIS LST product.

10.5194/essd-16-3781-2024,Retrieving ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in China (2013–2021) with a numerical-model-informed testbed to mitigate sample-imbalance-induced biases,"Surface PM2.5 data have gained widespread application in health assessments and related fields, while the inherent uncertainties in PM2.5 data persist due to the lack of ground-truth data across the space. This study provides a novel testbed, enabling comprehensive evaluation across the entire spatial domain. The optimized deep-learning model with spatiotemporal features successfully retrieved surface PM2.5 concentrations in China (2013–2021), with reduced biases induced by sample imbalance. 
 Ground-level PM2.5 data derived from satellites with machine learning are crucial for health and climate assessments. However, uncertainties persist due to the absence of spatially covered observations. To address this, we propose a novel testbed using nontraditional numerical simulations to evaluate PM2.5 estimation across the entire spatial domain. The testbed emulates the general machine-learning approach by training the model with grids corresponding to ground monitoring sites and subsequently testing its predictive accuracy for other locations. Our approach enables comprehensive evaluation of various machine-learning methods' performance in estimating PM2.5 across the spatial domain for the first time. Unexpected results are shown in the application in China, with larger absolute PM2.5 biases found in densely populated regions with abundant ground observations across all benchmark models due to the higher baseline concentration, though the relative error (approximately 20 %) is smaller compared to that in rural areas (over 50 %). The imbalance in training samples, mostly from urban areas with high emissions, is the main reason, leading to significant overestimation due to the lack of monitors in downwind areas where PM2.5 is transported from urban areas with varying vertical profiles. Our proposed testbed also provides an efficient strategy for optimizing model structure or training samples to enhance satellite-retrieval model performance. Integration of spatiotemporal features, especially with conventional neural network (CNN)-based deep-learning approaches like the residual neural network (ResNet) model, has successfully mitigated PM2.5 overestimation (by 5–30 µg m−3) and the corresponding exposure (by 3 million people ⋅ µg m−3) in the downwind area over 9 years (2013–2021) compared to the traditional approach. Furthermore, the incorporation of 600 strategically positioned ground monitoring sites identified through the testbed is essential for achieving a more balanced distribution of training samples, thereby ensuring precise PM2.5 estimation and facilitating the assessment of the associated impacts in China. In addition to presenting the retrieved surface PM2.5 concentrations in China from 2013 to 2021, this study provides a testbed dataset derived from physical modeling simulations which can serve to evaluate the performance of data-driven methodologies, such as machine learning, in estimating spatial PM2.5 concentrations for the community (Li et al., 2024a; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11122294).",Siwei Li;Yu Ding;Jia Xing;Joshua S.

This work employed the random forest machine learning model to provide spatially explicit peat carbon stock at pixel basis. 
 Peatlands, which only cover 3 to 5 percent of the global land area, can store up to twice the amount of carbon as the world’s forests. Although recognised for their significant role in the global carbon cycle, discovering the global extent of peatlands and their carbon stock remains challenging. Referring to the UNEP's global peatland map, here we present PEATGRIDS, a data product containing global maps of peat thickness and carbon stock created created using the digital soil mapping approach. We compiled over 25,000 observations of peatland thickness, bulk density (BD) and carbon content (CC), globally. Using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, we estimated peat thickness and peat BD and CC at ~1 km resolution at multiple depths (0–2 m) globally. The estimates were generated using 19 land surface covariates from digital maps and remote sensing images of land use, soil characteristics, topographical features, and climate parameters. The RF models for peat thickness were trained on 25,200 points grouped into six geographic regions. Validation of the peat thickness estimates showed a good performance, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.15 to 0.72. The prediction for peat BD and CC followed the same model architecture and were trained on 17,000 and 7,000 points, respectively. Overall, BD and CC models performed well and consistently across soil layers with average R2 values of 0.61 for BD and 0.48 for CC. Based on the estimated peat thickness, BD and CC, the carbon stock of global peatland was estimated to be 1,029 Pg C for peat dominated area of 6.57 million km2.

 The number of studies investigating the effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms and communities increases every year. Results are not easily comparable since the carbonate chemistry and ancillary data are not always reported in similar units and scales and are not calculated using similar sets of constants.

Our database permits, for the first time, to investigate glacier temperature distributions at global or regional scales for the first time. 
 Measurements of englacial temperatures have been collected since the earliest years of glaciology, with the first measurements dating back to the mid-19th century.

10.5194/essd-16-3755-2024,First comprehensive stable isotope dataset of diverse water units in a permafrost-dominated catchment on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau,"We present the temporal data of stable isotopes in different waterbodies in the Beiluhe Basin in the hinterland of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) produced between 2017 and 2022. In this article, the first detailed stable isotope data of 359 ground ice samples are presented. This first data set provides a new basis for understanding the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation on the QTP. 
 Considered the Asian water tower, the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) processes substantial permafrost, and its hydrological environments are spatially different and can be easily disturbed by changing permafrost and melting ground ice. Permafrost degradation compels melting permafrost to become an important source of surface runoff, changes the storage of groundwater, and greatly influences the hydrological processes in permafrost regions. However, the evidence linking permafrost degradation and hydrological processes on the QTP is lacking, which increases the uncertainties in the evaluation of the results of changing permafrost on the water resources. Stable isotopes offer valuable information on the connections between changing permafrost (ground ice) and water components. It is therefore particularly important to observe the changes in the stable isotopes of different waterbodies which can vary over hourly to annual timescales and truly capture the thawing signals and reflect the influence of permafrost (ground ice) on the regional hydrological processes. The Beiluhe Basin (BLH) in the hinterland of the QTP was selected; it integrates all the water components related to hydrological cycles well and is an ideal site to study the hydrological effect of permafrost change. This paper presents the temporal data of stable isotopes (δ18O, δD, and d-excess) in different waterbodies (precipitation, stream water, thermokarst lake, and groundwater) in the BLH produced between 2017 and 2022. Here, the first detailed stable isotope data of ground ice at 17 boreholes and 2 thaw slumps are presented. A detailed description of the sampling processes, sample pretreating processes, and isotopic data quality control is given. The data first described the full seasonal isotope amplitude in the precipitation, stream, and thermokarst lakes and delineated the depth isotopic variability in ground ice. In total, 554 precipitation samples, 2402 lake/pond samples, 675 stream water samples, 102 supra-permafrost water samples, and 19 sub-permafrost water samples were collected during 6 years of continuous sampling work. Importantly, 359 ground ice samples at different depths from 17 boreholes and 2 profiles were collected. This first dataset provides a new basis for understanding the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation on the QTP. It also provides support for the cryospheric study on the Northern Hemisphere.

10.5194/essd-2024-344,The Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to the Global Forecast of Temperature-Humidity Index with High Temporal Resolution,"Climate change is posing increasing challenges in the dairy cattle farming sector, as heat stress adversely affects the animals' health and milk production. To accurately asses these impacts, we developed a machine learning model to downscale daily climate data to hourly Temperature Humidity Index (THI) values. We utilised historical weather data to train our model and applied it to future climate projections, under two climate scenarios. 
 Climate change poses a significant threat to agriculture, with potential impacts on food security, economic stability, and human livelihoods. Dairy cattle, a crucial component of the livestock sector, are particularly vulnerable to heat stress, which can adversely affect milk production, immune function, feed intake, and in extreme cases, lead to mortality. The Temperature Humidity Index (THI) is a widely used metric to quantify the combined effects of temperature and humidity on cattle. However, most studies estimate THI using daily-level data, which fails to capture the full extent of daily thermal load and cumulative heat stress, especially during nights when cooling is inadequate. To address this limitation, we developed a machine learning approach to temporally downscale daily climate data to hourly THI values. Utilizing historical ERA5 reanalysis data, we trained an XGBoost model and generated hourly THI datasets for 12 NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 climate models under two emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) extending to the end of the century. This high-resolution THI data provides a more accurate assessment of heat stress in dairy cattle, enabling better predictions and management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on this vital agricultural sector.",Pantelis Georgiades;Theo Economou;Yiannis Proestos;Jose Araya;Jos Lelieveld;Marco Neira,Earth System Science Data Discussions,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注气候变化对奶牛养殖业的影响，特别是高温热应激对奶牛健康和产奶量的影响。研究人员利用机器学习模型对每日气候数据进行降尺度处理，生成每小时的温度湿度指数（THI）值，以更准确地评估奶牛的热应激水平。该研究没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。
10.5194/essd-2024-334,Seeing through the Sea with Satellites: Reconstructing Ocean Subsurface Temperature and Salinity with Satellite Observations,"Ocean data are crucial for ocean science and climate change research. In this study, we develop a novel algorithm to infer ocean subsurface temperature and salinity using satellite observations of ocean surface properties. The algorithm proposed is efficient, interpretable and widely applicable. The resultant dataset has a global coverage with a high spatial resolution (0.25°x0.25°) and has been validated against in-situ observations with satisfactory accuracy. 
 In-situ measurements of ocean temperature and salinity are critical to ocean-related studies but are limited in space and time. Satellite retrievals provide high-resolution, globally-covered sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS) and cannot directly measure the subsurface information., and height (SSH), but are limited to the ocean surface and cannot directly measure the subsurface information. Here we design a physics-informed algorithm that can reconstruct the vertical distributions of upper ocean temperature and salinity based purely on satellite observations. The algorithm stresses the tight ocean surface-subsurface coupling and the co-variability of ocean temperature and salinity. It is firstly tested with climate model simulations and then validated with actual observations by Argo floats, moored buoys and multiple ocean reanalysis datasets. The resultant satellite-based upper ocean temperature and salinity dataset has a global coverage, a high spatial resolution, and resolves ocean thermohaline structure from surface to 400 m. This dataset complements existing ocean subsurface products as an independent satellite-based observational dataset. The success of our reconstruction algorithm highlights a pressing need to maintain and advance the satellite observations of SST, SSS, and SSH.

Our study created a comprehensive Alaska inventory combining various data sources with which we improved infrastructure classification and data on contaminated sites. This resource is presented as a GeoPackage allowing planning of infrastructure damage and possible implications for Arctic communities facing permafrost challenges. 
 The Arctic region has undergone warming at a rate more than 3 times higher than the global average. This warming has led to the degradation of near-surface permafrost, resulting in decreased ground stability. This instability not only poses a primary hazard to Arctic infrastructure and human-impacted areas but can also lead to secondary ecological hazards from infrastructure failure associated with hazardous materials. This development underscores the need for a comprehensive inventory of critical infrastructure and human-impacted areas. The inventory should be linked to environmental data to assess their susceptibility to permafrost degradation as well as the ecological consequences that may arise from infrastructure failure. Here, we provide such an inventory for Alaska, a vast state covering approximately 1.7 × 106 km2, with a population of over 733 000 people and a history of industrial development on permafrost. Our Synthesized Inventory of CRitical Infrastructure and HUman-Impacted Areas in AlaSka (SIRIUS) integrates data from (i) the Sentinel-1/2-derived Arctic Coastal Human Impact dataset (SACHI); (ii) OpenStreetMap (OSM); (iii) the pan-Arctic Catchment Database (ARCADE); (iv) a dataset of permafrost extent, probability and mean annual ground temperatures; and (v) the Contaminated Sites Database and reports to create a unified new dataset of critical infrastructure and human-impacted areas as well as permafrost and watershed information for Alaska. The integration process included harmonizing spatial references, extents and geometries across all the datasets as well as incorporating a uniform usage type classification scheme for the infrastructure data. Additionally, we employed text-mining techniques to generate complementary geospatial data from textual reports on contaminated sites, including details on contaminants, cleanup duration and the affected media. The combination of SACHI and OSM enhanced the detail of the usage type classification for infrastructure from 5 to 13 categories, allowing the identification of elements critical to Arctic communities beyond industrial sites. Further, the new inventory integrates the high spatial detail of OSM with the unbiased infrastructure detection capability of SACHI, accurately representing 94 % of the  polygonal infrastructure and 78 % of the linear infrastructure, respectively. The SIRIUS dataset is presented as a GeoPackage, enabling spatial analysis and queries of its components, either as a function of or in combination with one another.

10.5194/essd-2024-309,A machine-learning reconstruction of sea surface pCO2 in the North American Atlantic Coastal Ocean Margin from 1993 to 2021,"This study addresses the lack of comprehensive sea surface CO2 data in North American Atlantic coastal regions by developing a new pCO2-product (ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2). Using machine learning and environmental data, it reconstructs sea surface CO2 levels from 1993–2021. The product accurately captures seasonal cycles, regional variations, and long-term trends, outperforming earlier attempts. It provides crucial data for studying coastal carbon dynamics and climate change impacts. 
 Insufficient spatiotemporal coverage of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) observations has hindered precise studies of the coastal carbon cycle along the North American Atlantic Coastal Ocean Margin (NAACOM). Earlier pCO2-products have encountered difficulties in accurately capturing the heterogeneity of regional variations and decadal trends of pCO2 in the NAACOM. This study developed a regional reconstructed pCO2-product for the NAACOM (Reconstructed Coastal Acidification Database-pCO2, or ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2) using a two-step approach combining random forest regression and linear regression. The product provides monthly pCO2 data at 0.25° spatial resolution from 1993 to 2021, enabling investigation of regional spatial differences, seasonal cycles, and decadal changes in pCO2. The observation-based reconstruction was trained using Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) observations as ground-truth values, with various satellite-derived and reanalysis environmental variables known to control sea surface pCO2 as model inputs. The product shows high accuracy during the model training, validation, and independent test phases, demonstrating robustness and capability to accurately reconstruct pCO2 in regions or periods lacking direct observational data in the NAACOM. Compared with all the observation samples from SOCAT, the pCO2-product yields a determination coefficient of 0.83, a root-mean-square error of 18.64 µatm, and an accumulative uncertainty of 23.83 µatm. The ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2 product demonstrates its capability to resolve seasonal cycles, regional-scale variations, and decadal linear trends of pCO2 along the NAACOM. This new product provides reliable pCO2 data for more precise studies of coastal carbon dynamics in the NAACOM region.

10.5194/essd-16-3687-2024,A synthesized field survey database of vegetation and active-layer properties for the Alaskan tundra (1972–2020),"The Arctic tundra is experiencing widespread physical and biological changes, largely in response to warming, yet scientific understanding of tundra ecology and change remains limited due to relatively limited accessibility and studies compared to other terrestrial biomes. To support synthesis research and inform future studies, we created the Synthesized Alaskan Tundra Field Dataset (SATFiD), which brings together field datasets and includes vegetation, active-layer, and fire properties. 
 Studies in recent decades have shown strong evidence of physical and biological changes in the Arctic tundra, largely in response to rapid rates of warming. Given the important implications of these changes for ecosystem services, hydrology, surface energy balance, carbon budgets, and climate feedbacks, research on the trends and patterns of these changes is becoming increasingly important and can help better constrain estimates of local, regional, and global impacts as well as inform mitigation and adaptation strategies. Despite this great need, scientific understanding of tundra ecology and change remains limited, largely due to the inaccessibility of this region and less intensive studies compared to other terrestrial biomes. A synthesis of existing datasets from past field studies can make field data more accessible and open up possibilities for collaborative research as well as for investigating and informing future studies. Here, we synthesize field datasets of vegetation and active-layer properties from the Alaskan tundra, one of the most well-studied tundra regions.

10.5194/essd-16-3705-2024,A 100 m gridded population dataset of China's seventh census using ensemble learning and big geospatial data,"Population data is crucial for human–nature interactions. Gridded population data can address limitations of census data in irregular units. In China, rapid urbanization necessitates timely and accurate population grids. However, existing datasets for China are either outdated or lack recent census data. Hence, a novel approach was developed to disaggregate China’s seventh census data into 100 m population grids. The resulting dataset outperformed the existing LandScan and WorldPop datasets. 
 China has undergone rapid urbanization and internal migration in the past few years, and its up-to-date gridded population datasets are essential for various applications. Existing datasets for China, however, suffer from either outdatedness or failure to incorporate data from the latest Seventh National Population Census of China, conducted in 2020. In this study, we develop a novel population downscaling approach that leverages stacking ensemble learning and big geospatial data to produce up-to-date population grids at a 100 m resolution for China using seventh census data at both county and town levels. The proposed approach employs stacking ensemble learning to integrate the strengths of random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM through fusing their predictions in a training mechanism, and it delineates the inhabited areas from big geospatial data to enhance the gridded population estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits the best-fit performance compared to individual base models. Meanwhile, the out-of-sample town-level test set indicates that the estimated gridded population dataset (R2=0.8936) is more accurate than existing WorldPop (R2=0.7427) and LandScan (R2=0.7165) products for China in 2020. Furthermore, with the inhabited area enhancement, the spatial distribution of population grids is intuitively more reasonable than the two existing products. Hence, the proposed population downscaling approach provides a valuable option for producing gridded population datasets. The estimated 100 m gridded population dataset of China holds great significance for future applications, and it is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24916140.v1 (Chen et al., 2024b).",Yuehong Chen;Congcong Xu;Yong Ge;Xiaoxiang Zhang;Ya'nan Zhou,Earth System Science Data,FALSE,[],该论文主要关注中国第七次人口普查数据的网格化处理，利用机器学习方法将县级和镇级人口数据细化到100米分辨率的网格，并与现有数据集（WorldPop和LandScan）进行比较。该研究与大气环境遥感技术没有直接关系，主要应用于人口分布、城市规划等领域。

This CAMELS addition is the first containing both, gauged and ungauged catchments as well as detailed groundwater information. The dataset provides dynamic and static variables for 3330 catchments from various hydrogeological datasets, meteorological observations, and a well-established national-scale hydrological model. The dataset is enhanced with streamflow observations in 304 of those catchments. The spatially dense and full spatial coverage, supplying data for 3330 catchments, instead of only gauged catchments, together with the addition of simulation data from a distributed, process-based model enhance the applicability of such CAMELS data. This is especially relevant for the development of data-driven and hybrid physical informed modelling frameworks. We also provide quantities related to human impact on the hydrological system in Denmark, such as groundwater abstraction and irrigation. The CAMELS-DK dataset is freely available at https://doi.org/10.22008/FK2/AZXSYP (Koch et al., 2024).",Jun Liu;Julian Koch;Simon Stisen;Lars Troldborg;Anker Lajer Højberg;Hans Thodsen;Mark F. T.

10.5194/essd-2024-225,A vegetation phenology dataset by integrating multiple sources using the Reliability Ensemble Averaging method,"Global changes have significantly altered vegetation phenology, affecting terrestrial carbon cycle. While various remote-sensing-based phenology datasets exist, they often suffer from inconsistencies and uncertainties. To address this, we developed a new phenology dataset spanning 1982 to 2022 using a reliability ensemble averaging method. Validated against ground data, our dataset demonstrates substantially improved accuracy, providing a novel and reliable source for global ecological studies. 
 Global change has substantially shifted vegetation phenology, with important implications in the carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystems. Various vegetation phenology datasets have been developed using remote sensing data; however, the significant uncertainties in these datasets limit our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in terms of phenology. It is therefore crucial to generate a reliable large-scale vegetation phenology dataset, by fusing various existing vegetation phenology datasets, to provide comprehensive and accurate estimation of vegetation phenology with fine spatiotemporal resolution. In this study, we merged four widely used vegetation phenology datasets to generate a new dataset using the Reliability Ensemble Averaging fusion method. The spatial resolution of the new dataset is 0.05° and its temporal scale spans 1982–2022. The evaluation using the ground-based PhenoCam dataset from 280 sites indicated that the accuracy of the newly merged dataset was improved substantially. The start of growing season and the end of growing season in the newly merged dataset had the largest correlation (0.84 and 0.71, respectively) and accuracy in terms of the root mean square error (12 and 17 d, respectively). Using the new dataset, we found that the start of growing season exhibits a significant (p < 0.01) advanced trend with a rate of approximately 0.24 d yr−1, and that the end of growing season exhibits a significant (p < 0.01) delayed trend with a rate of 0.16 d yr−1 over the period 1982–2022.

10.5194/essd-16-3601-2024,State of Wildfires 2023–2024,"This inaugural State of Wildfires report catalogues extreme fires of the 2023–2024 fire season. For key events, we analyse their predictability and drivers and attribute them to climate change and land use. We provide a seasonal outlook and decadal projections. Key anomalies occurred in Canada, Greece, and western Amazonia, with other high-impact events catalogued worldwide. Climate change significantly increased the likelihood of extreme fires, and mitigation is required to lessen future risk. 
 Climate change contributes to the increased frequency and intensity of wildfires globally, with significant impacts on society and the environment. However, our understanding of the global distribution of extreme fires remains skewed, primarily influenced by media coverage and regionalised research efforts. This inaugural State of Wildfires report systematically analyses fire activity worldwide, identifying extreme events from the March 2023–February 2024 fire season. We assess the causes, predictability, and attribution of these events to climate change and land use and forecast future risks under different climate scenarios. During the 2023–2024 fire season, 3.9×106 km2 burned globally, slightly below the average of previous seasons, but fire carbon (C) emissions were 16 % above average, totalling 2.4 Pg C. Global fire C emissions were increased by record emissions in Canadian boreal forests (over 9 times the average) and reduced by low emissions from African savannahs. Notable events included record-breaking fire extent and emissions in Canada, the largest recorded wildfire in the European Union (Greece), drought-driven fires in western Amazonia and northern parts of South America, and deadly fires in Hawaii (100 deaths) and Chile (131 deaths). Over 232 000 people were evacuated in Canada alone, highlighting the severity of human impact. Our analyses revealed that multiple drivers were needed to cause areas of extreme fire activity. In Canada and Greece, a combination of high fire weather and an abundance of dry fuels increased the probability of fires, whereas burned area anomalies were weaker in regions with lower fuel loads and higher direct suppression, particularly in Canada. Fire weather prediction in Canada showed a mild anomalous signal 1 to 2 months in advance, whereas events in Greece and Amazonia had shorter predictability horizons. Attribution analyses indicated that modelled anomalies in burned area were up to 40 %, 18 %, and 50 % higher due to climate change in Canada, Greece, and western Amazonia during the 2023–2024 fire season, respectively. Meanwhile, the probability of extreme fire seasons of these magnitudes has increased significantly due to anthropogenic climate change, with a 2.9–3.6-fold increase in likelihood of high fire weather in Canada and a 20.0–28.5-fold increase in Amazonia. By the end of the century, events of similar magnitude to 2023 in Canada are projected to occur 6.3–10.8 times more frequently under a medium–high emission scenario (SSP370). This report represents our first annual effort to catalogue extreme wildfire events, explain their occurrence, and predict future risks. By consolidating state-of-the-art wildfire science and delivering key insights relevant to policymakers, disaster management services, firefighting agencies, and land managers, we aim to enhance society's resilience to wildfires and promote advances in preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation.

10.5194/essd-2024-325,Mapping global leaf inclination angle (LIA) based on field measurement data,"Leaf inclination angle (LIA) is a vital parameter in radiative transfer, rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and hydrological processes. However, global LIA knowledge is still lacking. This study generated the first global 500 m LIA products by gap-filling LIA measurement data. The global LIA is 41.47°±9.55° and increases with latitude. The LIA products would enhance our understanding of global LIA and assist remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies. 
 Leaf inclination angle (LIA), the angle between leaf surface normal and zenith directions, is a vital parameter in radiative transfer, rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and hydrological processes. Due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale field measurement data, LIA is typically assumed to follow the spherical leaf distribution or simply considered constant for different plant types. However, the appropriateness of these simplifications and the global LIA distribution are still unknown. This study compiled global LIA measurements and generated the first global 500 m mean LIA (MLA) product by gap-filling the LIA measurement data using a random forest regressor. Different generation strategies were employed for noncrops and crops. The MLA product was evaluated by validating the nadir leaf projection function (G(0)) derived from the MLA product with high-resolution reference data. The global MLA is 41.47°±9.55°, and the value increases with latitude. The MLAs for different vegetation types follow the order of cereal crops (54.65°) > broadleaf crops (52.35°) > deciduous needleleaf forest (50.05°) > shrubland (49.23°) > evergreen needleleaf forest (47.13°) ≈ grassland (47.12°) > deciduous broadleaf forest (41.23°) > evergreen broadleaf forest (34.40°). Cross-validation shows that the predicted MLA presents a medium consistency (r = 0.75, RMSE = 7.15°) with the validation samples for noncrops, whereas crops show relatively lower correspondence (r = 0.48 and 0.60 for broadleaf crops and cereal crops) because of limited LIA measurements and strong seasonality. The global G(0) distribution is opposite to that of the MLA and agrees moderately with the reference data (r = 0.62, RMSE = 0.15). This study shows that the common spherical and constant LIA assumptions may underestimate the intercept capability for most vegetation. The MLA and G(0) products derived in this study would enhance our knowledge about global LIA and should greatly facilitate remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies.",Sijia Li;Hongliang Fang,Earth System Science Data Discussions,TRUE,"['leaf inclination angle', 'remote sensing', 'land surface modeling', 'radiative transfer', 'evapotranspiration']",该研究关注的是叶片倾角 (LIA) 的全球分布及其对辐射传输、蒸散、降雨截留等过程的影响。研究人员通过整合全球 LIA 测量数据，构建了全球 500 米分辨率的 LIA 产品，并利用该产品推算出了全球叶片投影函数 (G(0))。这些产品可以帮助我们更好地理解全球 LIA 的分布规律，并为遥感反演和陆面模型研究提供重要参考。
10.5194/essd-2024-279,Global agricultural lands in the year 2015,"We present a global geospatial database of cropland and pastures representing the year 2015. We made it using machine learning models to merge satellite-based land cover data with agricultural census data that we compiled. This database is an update to an earlier version representing the year 2000. It can be used to study issues such as land use, food security, climate change and biodiversity loss. We provide a reproducible code base to easily update the product for future years. 
 While there are many global geospatial datasets representing the extent of agriculture, they predominantly represent croplands. Only a couple of global data products represent the full global agricultural footprint, including pastures. Our own research team’s most recent complete publicly available agricultural land cover dataset, including both croplands and pastures, represent circa 2000. These data, distributed on a graticule of 5 arcminutes (~10 km2 at the equator), have been integrated into a considerable number and diversity of research studies, modeling, data science and media applications. Further, users of these data have been interested in them for studying a variety of issues such as land use, food security, climate change and biodiversity loss. Here we present an updated dataset on the global distribution of agricultural lands (cropland and pasture) circa 2015 (15 years on since the initial study). Past studies that have constructed such datasets have been one-off exercises that have been infrequently repeated due to the amount of effort required. Therefore, in this work, we developed a transparent and reproducible approach to update our data product while also enabling easier reproduction of future datasets.

 Accurately quantifying global mass changes at the Earth’s surface is essential for understanding climate system dynamics and their evolution.

10.5194/gmd-17-6319-2024,Deep-learning-driven simulations of boundary layer clouds over the Southern Great Plains,"Using 2 decades of field observations over the Southern Great Plains, this study developed a deep-learning model to simulate the complex dynamics of boundary layer clouds. The deep-learning model can serve as the cloud parameterization within reanalysis frameworks, offering insights into improving the simulation of low clouds. By quantifying biases due to various meteorological factors and parameterizations, this deep-learning-driven approach helps bridge the observation–modeling divide. 
 Based on long-term observations at the Southern Great Plains site by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program for training and validation, a deep-learning model is developed to simulate the daytime evolution of boundary layer clouds (BLCs) from the perspective of land–atmosphere coupling. The model takes ARM measurements (including early-morning soundings and diurnally varying surface meteorological conditions and heat fluxes) as inputs and predicts hourly estimates (including cloud occurrence, the positions of cloud boundaries, and the vertical profile of the cloud fraction) as outputs. The deep-learning model offers good agreement with the observed cloud fields, especially in the accuracy with which cloud occurrence and base height are reproduced. When the inputs are substituted by reanalysis data from ERA5 and MERRA-2, the outputs of the deep-learning model provide a better agreement with observation than the cloud fields extracted from ERA5 and MERRA-2 themselves. Thus, the deep-learning model shows great potential to serve as a diagnostic tool for the performance of physics-based models in simulating stratiform and cumulus clouds. By quantifying biases in clouds and attributing them to the simulated atmospheric state variables versus the model-parameterized cloud processes, this observation-based deep-learning model may offer insights into the directions needed to improve the simulation of BLCs in physics-based models for weather forecasting and climate prediction.",Tianning Su;Yunyan Zhang,Geoscientific Model Development,TRUE,"['boundary layer clouds', 'satellite observations', 'reanalysis frameworks', 'cloud parameterization', 'weather forecasting', 'climate prediction']",这篇论文研究了利用深度学习模型模拟南部大平原边界层云的动态变化。该模型以大气辐射测量 (ARM) 计划在南部大平原站点收集的长期观测数据为训练和验证数据，并以地面气象条件和热通量等观测数据作为输入，预测云的存在、云边界位置和云量垂直剖面等信息。研究结果表明，该模型能够很好地模拟云场的演变，并能有效地提高再分析数据对云场的模拟精度。该研究表明，深度学习模型可以作为诊断工具，用于评估物理模型模拟层状云和积云的能力，并为改进天气预报和气候预测模型中边界层云的模拟提供参考。
10.5194/gmd-17-6301-2024,Mixed-precision computing in the GRIST dynamical core for weather and climate modelling,"This study explores strategies and techniques for implementing mixed-precision code optimization within an atmosphere model dynamical core. The coded equation terms in the governing equations that are sensitive (or insensitive) to the precision level have been identified. The performance of mixed-precision computing in weather and climate simulations was analyzed. 
 Atmosphere modelling applications are becoming increasingly memory-bound due to the inconsistent development rates between processor speeds and memory bandwidth. In this study, we mitigate memory bottlenecks and reduce the computational load of the Global–Regional Integrated Forecast System (GRIST) dynamical core by adopting a mixed-precision computing strategy. Guided by an application of the iterative development principle, we identify the coded equation terms that are precision insensitive and modify them from double to single precision. The results show that most precision-sensitive terms are predominantly linked to pressure gradient and gravity terms, while most precision-insensitive terms are advective terms. Without using more computing resources, computational time can be saved, and the physical performance of the model is largely kept. In the standard computational test, the reference runtime of the model's dry hydrostatic core, dry nonhydrostatic core, and the tracer transport module is reduced by 24 %, 27 %, and 44 %, respectively. A series of idealized tests, real-world weather and climate modelling tests, was performed to assess the optimized model performance qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, in the long-term coarse-resolution climate simulation, the precision-induced sensitivity can manifest at the large scale, while in the kilometre-scale weather forecast simulation, the model's sensitivity to the precision level is mainly limited to small-scale features, and the wall-clock time is reduced by 25.5 % from the double- to mixed-precision full-model simulations.",Siyuan Chen;Yi Zhang;Yiming Wang;Zhuang Liu;Xiaohan Li;Wei Xue,Geoscientific Model Development,FALSE,[],这篇论文主要关注的是天气和气候模型的数值模拟，采用混合精度计算优化模型的性能。文章分析了不同精度对模型中不同方程项的影响，并通过一系列数值实验验证了混合精度计算的有效性。论文没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。

Integrating various models, the software provides reliable and rapid assessment, mapping risk areas, and estimating tsunami amplitude. This advancement reduces false alarms and enhances global tsunami warning systems' accuracy and efficiency. 
 We introduce a tsunami warning technology towards a global real-time analysis. The technology is based on the analysis of acoustic signals generated together with the tsunami, due to the compression of the water layer. The acoustic signals propagate much faster than the tsunami, and thus can be recorded at hydrophone stations, which in turn enables the analysis in real-time. The presented technology comprises a collection of models that have been integrated into a software with the goal to make it operational, to complement efforts by warning centres and provide a more reliable assessment, globally. The main models that were integrated in the software are presented and briefly discussed. Test cases performed by the software are compared with DART buoy observations, showing satisfactory agreement though discrepancies arise in particular at far distances and locations separated by land. The calculation time of a full global-scale analysis is in the order of tens of seconds on a standard multi-core machine, without reliance on pre-computations, making it appropriate real-time forecast.",Usama Kadri;Ali Abdolali;Maxim Filimonov,Geoscientific Model Development Discussions,FALSE,[],该论文介绍了一种名为GREAT v1.0的软件，它利用海啸产生的声波信号进行实时预警。声波传播速度快于海啸本身，因此可以提前检测到海啸并进行预警。该软件集成了多种模型，能够快速评估海啸风险区域并估计海啸波幅。这项技术可以有效降低误报率，提高全球海啸预警系统的准确性和效率。该论文主要关注海啸预警技术，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

 We present Alquimia v1.0, a generic interface to geochemical solvers that facilitates development of multiphysics simulators by enabling code coupling, prototyping and benchmarking. The interface enforces a call signature for setting up, solving, serving up output data, and other common auxiliary tasks, while providing a set of structures for data transfer between the multiphysics code driving the simulation and the geochemical solver.

10.5194/gmd-17-6277-2024,A conservative immersed boundary method for the multi-physics urban large-eddy simulation model uDALES v2.0,"Designing cities that are resilient, sustainable, and beneficial to health requires an understanding of urban climate and air quality. This article presents an upgrade to the multi-physics numerical model uDALES, which can simulate microscale airflow, heat transfer, and pollutant dispersion in urban environments. This upgrade enables it to resolve realistic urban geometries more accurately and to take advantage of the resources available on current and future high-performance computing systems. 
 uDALES is an open-source multi-physics microscale urban modelling tool, capable of performing large-eddy simulation (LES) of urban airflow, heat transfer, and pollutant dispersion. We present uDALES v2.0, which has two main new features: (1) an improved parallelisation that prepares the codebase for conducting exascale simulations and (2) a conservative immersed boundary method (IBM) suitable for an urban surface that does not need to be aligned with the underlying Cartesian grid. The urban geometry and local topography are incorporated via a triangulated surface with a resolution that is independent of the fluid grid. The IBM developed here includes the use of wall functions to apply surface fluxes, and the exchange of heat and moisture between the surface and the air is conservative by construction. We perform a number of validation simulations, ranging from neutral, coupled internal–external flows and non-neutral cases. We observe close agreement with the relevant literature, both in cases in which the buildings are aligned with the Cartesian grid and when they are at an angle. We introduce a validation case specifically for urban applications, for which we show that supporting non-grid-aligned geometries is crucial when solving surface energy balances, with errors of up to 20 % associated with using a grid-aligned geometry.",Sam O.

10.5194/gmd-2024-121,"CMIP6 models overestimate sea ice melt, growth & conduction relative to ice mass balance buoy estimates","This study uses ice mass balance buoys – temperature and height-measuring devices frozen into sea ice – to find how well climate models simulate the melt & growth of, and conduction of heat through, Arctic sea ice. This may help understand why models produce varying amounts of sea ice in the present day. We find models tend to show more melt, growth or conduction for a given ice thickness than the buoys, though the difference is smaller for models with more physically realistic thermodynamics. 
 With the ongoing decline in Arctic sea ice extent, the accurate simulation of Arctic sea ice in coupled models remains an important problem in climate modelling. In this study, the substantial CMIP6 model spread in Arctic sea ice extent and volume is investigated using a novel, process-based approach. An observational dataset derived from the Arctic Ice Mass Balance buoy (IMB) network is used to evaluate the thermodynamic and mass balance diagnostics produced by a subset of CMIP6 models, to better understand the model processes that underlie the large-scale sea ice states.

10.5194/gmd-17-6249-2024,Dynamical Madden–Julian Oscillation forecasts using an ensemble subseasonal-to-seasonal forecast system of the IAP-CAS model,"We give an overview of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics–Chinese Academy of Sciences subseasonal-to-seasonal ensemble forecasting system and Madden–Julian Oscillation forecast evaluation of the system. Compared to other S2S models, the IAP-CAS model has its benefits but also biases, i.e., underdispersive ensemble, overestimated amplitude, and faster propagation speed when forecasting MJO. We provide a reason for these biases and prospects for further improvement of this system in the future. 
 The Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a crucial predictability source on a subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescale. Therefore, the models participating in the World Weather Research Programme and the World Climate Research Programme (WWRP/WCRP) S2S prediction project focus on accurately predicting and analyzing the MJO. This study provides a detailed description of the configuration within the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP-CAS) S2S forecast system. We assess the accuracy of the IAP-CAS model's MJO forecast using traditional Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM) analysis and cluster analysis. Then, we explain the reasons behind any bias observed in the MJO forecast. Comparing the 20-year hindcast with observations, we found that the IAP-CAS ensemble mean has a skill of 24 d. However, the ensemble spread still has potential for improvement. To examine the MJO structure in detail, we use cluster analysis to classify the MJO events during boreal winter into four types: fast-propagating, slow-propagating, standing, and jumping patterns of MJO. The model exhibits biases of overestimated amplitude and faster propagation speed in the propagating MJO events. Upon further analysis, it was found that the model forecasted a wetter background state. This leads to stronger forecasted convection and coupled waves, especially in the fast MJO events. The overestimation of the strength and length of MJO-coupled waves results in a faster MJO mode and quicker dissipation in the IAP-CAS model.

10.5194/gmd-17-6227-2024,Numerical stabilization methods for level-set-based ice front migration,"We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the stabilization and reinitialization techniques currently employed in ISSM and Úa for solving level-set equations, specifically those related to the dynamic representation of moving ice fronts within numerical ice sheet models. Our results demonstrate that the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) method outperforms the other approaches. We found that excessively frequent reinitialization can lead to exceptionally high errors in simulations. 
 Numerical modeling of ice sheet dynamics is a critical tool for projecting future sea level rise. Among all the processes responsible for the loss of mass of the ice sheets, enhanced ice discharge triggered by the retreat of marine-terminating glaciers is one of the key drivers. Numerical models of ice sheet flow are therefore required to include ice front migration in order to reproduce today's mass loss and to be able to predict their future. However, the discontinuous nature of calving poses a significant numerical challenge for accurately capturing the motion of the ice front. In this study, we explore different stabilization techniques combined with varying reinitialization strategies to enhance the numerical stability and accuracy of solving the level-set function, which tracks the position of the ice front. Through rigorous testing on an idealized domain with a semicircular and a straight-line ice front, including scenarios with diverse front velocities, we assess the performance of these techniques. The findings contribute to advancing our ability to model ice sheet dynamics, specifically calving processes, and provide valuable insights into the most effective strategies for simulating and tracking the motion of the ice front.",Gong Cheng;Mathieu Morlighem;G.

10.5194/gmd-17-6195-2024,RCEMIP-II: mock-Walker simulations as phase II of the radiative–convective equilibrium model intercomparison project,"This paper presents the experimental design for a model intercomparison project to study tropical clouds and climate. It is a follow-up from a prior project that used a simplified framework for tropical climate. The new project adds one new component – a specified pattern of sea surface temperatures as the lower boundary condition. We provide example results from one cloud-resolving model and one global climate model and test the sensitivity to the experimental parameters. 
 The radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE) model intercomparison project (RCEMIP) leveraged the simplicity of RCE to focus attention on moist convective processes and their interactions with radiation and circulation across a wide range of model types including cloud-resolving models (CRMs), general circulation models (GCMs), single-column models, global cloud-resolving models, and large-eddy simulations. While several robust results emerged across the spectrum of models that participated in the first phase of RCEMIP (RCEMIP-I), two points that stand out are (1) the strikingly large diversity in simulated climate states and (2) the strong imprint of convective self-aggregation on the climate state. However, the lack of consensus in the structure of self-aggregation and its response to warming is a barrier to understanding. Gaining a deeper understanding of convective aggregation and tropical climate will require reducing the degrees of freedom with which convection can vary. Therefore, we propose phase II of RCEMIP (RCEMIP-II) that utilizes a prescribed sinusoidal sea surface temperature (SST) pattern to provide a constraint on the structure of convection and move one critical step up the model hierarchy. This so-called “mock-Walker” configuration generates features that resemble observed tropical circulations. The specification of the mock-Walker protocol for RCEMIP-II is described, along with example results from one CRM and one GCM. RCEMIP-II will consist of five required simulations: three simulations with the same three mean SSTs as in RCEMIP-I but with an SST gradient and two additional simulations at one of the mean SSTs with different values of the SST gradients. We also test the sensitivity to the imposed SST gradient and the domain size. Under weak SST gradients, unforced self-aggregation emerges across the entire domain, similar to what was found in RCEMIP. As the SST gradient increases, the convective region narrows and is more confined to the warmest SSTs. At warmer mean SSTs and stronger SST gradients, low-frequency variability in the convective aggregation emerges, suggesting that simulations of at least 200 d may be needed to achieve robust equilibrium statistics in this configuration. Simulations with different domain sizes generally have similar mean statistics and convective structures, depending on the value of the SST gradient. The prescribed SST boundary condition is the only difference in the set-up between RCEMIP-II and RCEMIP-I, which enables comparison between the two; however, we also welcome participation in RCEMIP-II from models that did not participate in RCEMIP-I.",Allison A.

10.5194/gmd-17-6173-2024,Quantifying the role of ozone-caused damage to vegetation in the Earth system: a new parameterization scheme for photosynthetic and stomatal responses,"A new scheme is developed to model the surface ozone damage to vegetation in regional and global process-based models. Based on 4210 data points from ozone experiments, it accurately reproduces statistically significant linear or nonlinear photosynthetic and stomatal responses to ozone in observations for all vegetation types. It also enables models to implicitly capture the variability in plant ozone tolerance and the shift among species within a vegetation type. 
 Surface ozone (O3) is the primary air pollutant threatening global vegetation. It typically reduces the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, leading to changes in carbon, water, and energy cycles; vegetation structure and composition; and climate. Several parameterization schemes have been developed to integrate the photosynthetic and stomatal responses to O3 exposure in regional and global process-based models to simulate time- and space-varying O3 plant damage and its cascading dynamic influence. However, these schemes are calibrated based on limited observations and often fail to reproduce the response relationships in observations, impeding accurate assessments of the role of O3 plant damage in the Earth system. This study proposes a new parameterization scheme to utilize the extensive observations from O3 fumigation experiments to inform large-scale modeling. It is built on 4210 paired data points of photosynthetic and stomatal responses compiled from the peer-reviewed literature, more than 6 times larger than those employed in earlier schemes. Functions of phytotoxic O3 dose (POD) are found to accurately reproduce the statistically significant linear or nonlinear relationships observed between POD and either relative leaf photosynthetic rate or relative stomatal conductance for needleleaf trees, broadleaf trees, shrubs, grasses, and crops. These eliminate the practice in earlier schemes of setting response functions as constants and applying the response function from one vegetation type to another. It outperforms the old scheme in the Community Land Model (CLM), which skillfully reproduces the observed response for crop photosynthetic rate only. The nonlinear response functions we developed depict decreasing plant sensitivity with increases in POD, enabling models to implicitly capture the variability in plant ozone tolerance and the shift among plant species for both intra- and inter-PFTs (plant functional types) within a vegetation type observed in the real world. Then, the new scheme is incorporated into the Community Earth System Model version 2.2 (CESM2.2), specifically its land component CLM5, to quantify the global impacts of present-day O3 plant damage by comparing the simulations with and without O3 plant damage. Results show that O3 exposure reduces the global leaf photosynthetic rate by 8.5 % and stomatal conductance by 7.4 %, around half the estimates using the old scheme. Furthermore, the new scheme improves global gross primary productivity (GPP) simulations, decreasing RMSE by 11.1 % relative to simulations without O3 plant damage and by 11.7 % compared to the old scheme. These results underscore the importance of including O3 plant damage in large-scale process-based models and the effectiveness of the new scheme in assessing and projecting globally the role of O3 plant damage in the Earth system.",Fang Li;Zhimin Zhou;Samuel Levis;Stephen Sitch;Felicity Hayes;Zhaozhong Feng;Peter B.

Thus, our model provides a valuable tool for advancing the study of phytoplankton physiology, diversity, and evolution.

Other components of this ecosystem include dissolved inorganic nitrogen, twenty size classes of zooplankton, and detritus, all modelled as Eulerian fields.

DCESS II has been designed for global simulations over time scales of years to millions of years using limited computer resources like a personal computer. With its flexibility and comprehensive treatment of the global carbon cycle, DCESS II should prove to be a useful, computational-friendly tool for simulations of past climates as well as for future Earth System projections. 
 A new, Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity, DCESS II, is presented that builds upon, improves and extends the Danish Center for Earth System Science (DCESS) Earth System model (DCESS I). DCESS II has considerably greater spatial resolution than DCESS I while retaining the fine, 100 m vertical resolution in the ocean. It contains modules for the atmosphere, ocean, ocean sediment, land biosphere and lithosphere and is designed to deal with global change simulations on scales of years to millions of years while using limited computational resources. Tracers of the atmospheric module are temperature, nitrous oxide, methane (12,13C isotopes), carbon dioxide (12,13,14C isotopes) and atmospheric oxygen. For the ocean module, tracers are conservative temperature, absolute salinity, water 18O, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon (12,13,14C isotopes), alkalinity and dissolved oxygen. Furthermore, the ocean module considers simplified dynamical schemes for large-scale meridional circulation and sea-ice dynamics, stratification-dependent vertical diffusion, a gravity current approach to the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water and improvements in ocean biogeochemistry. DCESS II has two hemispheres with six zonal-averaged atmospheric boxes and twelve ocean boxes distributed across the Indian-Pacific, the Atlantic, the Arctic and the Southern Oceans.

(2011) mixed layer eddy parameterization, which restratifies the ocean surface layer through an overturning streamfunction. Results include surface layer biases reduction in temperature, salinity, and sea-ice extent in the North Atlantic, a small strengthening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and improvements in many atmospheric climatological variables. 
 The U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) version 2.1 builds on E3SMv2 with several changes, the most notable being the addition of the Fox-Kemper et al. (2011) mixed layer eddy parameterization. This parameterization captures the effect of finite-amplitude, mixed layer eddies as an overturning streamfunction and has the primary function of restratification. Herein, we outline the changes to the mean climate state of E3SM that were introduced by the addition of this parameterization. Overall, the presence of the submesoscale parameterization improves the fidelity of the v2.1 simulation by reducing the North Atlantic ocean surface biases present in v2, as illustrated by changes to the climatological sea surface temperature and salinity, as well as Arctic sea-ice extent. Other impacts include a slight shoaling of the mixed layer depths in the North Atlantic, as well as a small improvement to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We note that the expected shoaling due to the parameterization is regionally dependent in our coupled configuration. In addition, we investigate why the parameterization and its impacts on mixed layer depth have little impact on the simulated AMOC: despite increased dense water formation in the Norwegian Sea, only a small fraction of the water formed makes its way south into the North Atlantic basin.

This renders very useful for technical optimisation (e.g., GPU porting) and can be used to create less complex models, e.g., a chemical box model. 
 Adaptation of Earth system model (ESM) codes to modern computing architectures is challenging, as ESMs consist of a multitude of different components.

Python, as the ultimate glue language, enables the use of codes from nearly any programming language like Fortran, C++, Rust, and others. FINAM is designed to simplify the integration of various models with minimal effort, as demonstrated through various examples ranging from simple to complex systems. 
 In this study, we present a new coupling framework named FINAM (short for ""FINAM Is Not A Model""). FINAM is designed to facilitate the coupling of independently developed source codes and enable seamless model extensions by wrapping existing models into components with well-specified interfaces. Positioned between a coupling library and a full-fledged framework, FINAM allows users to couple preexisting wrapped models or to build models from scratch using its components. The primary goal of FINAM is to leverage the power of Python, facilitating rapid prototyping and ease of use for complex workflows while offloading computationally intensive parts to native models. FINAM supports bidirectional coupling of spatial models, enabling fast in-memory data exchange, and provides a consistent interface for flexible coupling. The main assumption for a successful coupling is that every model operates with a time loop at its core. This design of FINAM allows for straightforward model extensions written in Python without altering the original model source code. Python's robust interoperability features further enhance FINAM's capabilities, allowing interfaces with various programming languages including Fortran, C, C++, Rust, and others.

10.5194/gmd-2024-142,Evaluation of atmospheric rivers in reanalyses and climate models in a new metrics framework,"1. A metrics package designed for easy analysis of AR characteristics and statistics is presented. 2. The tool is efficient for diagnosing systematic AR bias in climate models, and useful for evaluating new AR characteristics in model simulations. 3. In climate models, landfalling AR precipitation shows dry biases globally, and AR tracks are farther poleward (equatorward) in the north and south Atlantic (south Pacific and Indian Ocean). 
 We present a suite of new atmospheric river (AR) metrics that are designed for quick analysis of AR characteristics and statistics in gridded climate datasets such as model output and reanalysis. This package is expected to be particularly useful for climate model evaluation. The metrics include mean bias and spatial pattern correlation, which are efficient for diagnosing systematic AR biases in climate models. For example, the package identifies that in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, AR tracks in the south Atlantic are positioned farther poleward compared to the ERA5 reanalysis, while in the south Pacific, tracks are generally biased towards the equator. For the landfalling AR peak season, we find that most climate models simulate a completely opposite seasonal cycle over western Africa. This tool is also useful for identifying and characterizing structural differences among different AR detectors (ARDTs). For example, ARs detected with the Mundhenk algorithm exhibit systematically larger size, width and length compared to the TempestExtremes (TE) method. The AR metrics developed from this work can be routinely applied for model benchmarking and during the development cycle to trace performance evolution across model versions or generations and set objective targets for the improvement of models.

We have developed an updated method of identifying these fronts in gridded data that can be used on new datasets with small grid spacing. The method can be easily applied to different datasets due to the use of open-source software for its development and shows improvements over similar previous methods. We present an updated estimate of the average frequency of fronts over the past 40 years. 
 Meteorological fronts are important due to their associated surface impacts, including extreme precipitation and extreme winds. Objective identification of fronts is therefore of interest in both operational weather prediction and research settings. The aim of this study is to produce a front identification algorithm based on earlier studies that is portable and scalable to different resolution datasets. We have made a number of changes to an earlier objective front identification algorithm, applied these to reanalysis datasets, and present the improvements associated with these changes. First, we show that a change in the order of operations yields smoother fronts with fewer breaks. Next, we propose the selection of the front identification thresholds in terms of climatological quantiles of the threshold fields. This allows for comparison between datasets of differing resolutions. Finally, we include a number of numerical improvements in the implementation of the algorithm and better handling of short fronts, which yield further benefits in the smoothness and number of breaks.

It features a simple user interface and is optimised through the addition of a grid search input option (automatically searching for optimal models within a defined N-dimensional parameter space) and the ability to run multiple models in parallel. We show that for each number of models tested there is a performance benefit to parallel running, while two examples demonstrate a use case by improving an existing global model. 
 We present a parallel combination of existing, well-known and robust software used in modelling the neotectonics of planetary lithosphere, which we call ShellSet. An added parallel framework allows multiple models to be run at the same time with varied input parameters. Additionally, we have included a grid search option to automatically generate models within a given parameter space.

10.5194/gmd-2024-137,A Bayesian method for predicting background radiation at environmental monitoring stations,"To detect anomalous radioactivity in the environment, it is paramount that we understand the natural background level. In this work, we propose a statistical model to describe the most likely background level and the associated uncertainty in a network of dose rate detectors. We train, verify and validate the model using real environmental data. Using the model, we show that we can correctly predict the background level in a subset of the detector network during a known `anomalous’ event. 
 Detector networks that measure environmental radiation serve as radiological surveillance and early warning networks in many countries across Europe and beyond. Their goal is to detect anomalous radioactive signatures that indicate the release of radionuclides to the environment. Often, the background H·*(10) is predicted using meteorological information. However, in dense detector networks the correlation between different detectors is expected to contain markedly more information. In this work, we investigate how the joint observations by neighbouring detectors can be leveraged to predict the background H·*(10). Treating it as a stochastic vector, we show that its distribution can be approximated as multivariate normal. We reframe the question of background prediction as a Bayesian inference problem including priors and likelihood. Finally, we show that the conditional distribution can be used to make predictions. To perform the inferences we use PyMC. All inferences are performed using real data for the nuclear sites in Doel and Mol, Belgium. We validate our calibrated model on previously unseen data.

10.5194/gmd-2024-134,Model calibration and streamflow simulations for the extreme drought event of 2018 on the Rhine River Basin using WRF-Hydro 5.2.0,"We looked at how well the model WRF-Hydro performed during the 2018 drought event in the River Rhine basin, even though it is typically used for floods. We used the meteorological ERA5 reanalysis dataset to simulate River Rhine’s streamflow and adjusted the model using parameters and actual discharge measurements. We focused on Lake Constance, a key part of the basin, but found issues with the model’s lake outflow simulation. By removing the lake module, we obtained more accurate results. 
 Recent drought events have significantly affected navigation through the Rhine River and the transportation of goods due to low water levels. It has become imperative to analyze the conditions in which these events occur to establish actions to develop adaptive measures and avoid monetary losses. The main focus of this study is to calibrate the hydrological model for extremely low water levels and to test its performance during the 2018 drought event in the Rhine River basin. WRF-Hydro was developed to complement the land-atmosphere interactions with the meteorological model Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), and it has been mainly used to study flood events. In this study, we simulated the Rhine River basin’s streamflow using the meteorological ERA5 reanalysis dataset as input data. The calibration period is 2016–2017, during which the influence of several parameters on the streamflow was evaluated and contrasted with the daily observed discharge values at gauging stations along the river. Land use cover and terrain slope were used to create spatially distributed parameter maps, thus avoiding the calibration process of testing a range of values, substantially reducing computational demands. During calibration, the importance of modeling realistic outflow values of Lake Constance became apparent due to its significant contribution to the upper Rhine basin. However, WRF-Hydro’s lake module resulted in an overly strong dampening of streamflow. Lake Constance was, therefore, represented without the lake module, resulting in more realistic hydrographs and statistical scores. Overall, the calibration and validation process demonstrated that WRF-Hydro is capable of reproducing the variability of the discharge along the Rhine and capturing low water levels observed during the 2018 drought event. These results suggest that WRF-Hydro is a suitable model for analyzing recent and future drought events in the Rhine River basin under different climate conditions.",Andrea L.

Sensitivity may be changing with continuing climate change, yet a comprehensive assessment of its change is still lacking. We utilized tree ring measurements from 3,044 sites, climate data and CO2 concentrations obtained from monitoring stations, combined with dynamic global vegetation models to investigate spatiotemporal changes in the sensitivity over the past century. We observed an increasing sensitivity since around 1950. This increased sensitivity was particularly pronounced in arid biomes due to the combined effect of increased precipitation and elevated CO2. While elevated CO2 reduced the sensitivity of the humid regions, the intensified water pressure caused by decreased precipitation still increased the sensitivity. Our findings suggest an escalating vulnerability of tree growth to precipitation change, which may increase the risk of tree mortality under future intensified drought.",Tiewei Li;Bin He;Deliang Chen;Hans W.

This paper reports the characteristics of EMIC waves observed by Juno in the magnetic dip of Jupiter. Multiple‐band EMIC waves are observed in frequency range from 10−3 Hz to several Hz. The theoretical analysis shows that in this event both He+ band and O+ band EMIC waves can be constrained in the magnetic dip, which is consistent with the wave emissions observed inside the magnetic dip.

For the first time, we observed large‐distance northward propagation of intensive 2,000 km V‐shaped ionospheric disturbances from the rocket trajectory. The observed perturbations, most likely, represent shock waves propagating with the cone angle of ∼14° on the North and ∼7° on the South against the flight track that corresponds to the Mach angle of the shock waves in the lower atmosphere.

Once reintroduced into the active carbon cycle, this material will either be decomposed or buried on the shelf depending on its hydrodynamic and chemical properties. Currently, carbon estimates are based on bulk measurements, which does not take the hydrodynamic pathway of different fractions into account. Therefore, eight coastal permafrost locations have been sampled along the Canadian Beaufort Sea Coast, hydrodynamically fractionated and analyzed for their C, N, 13C and 14C content. We found that the matrix‐free fraction (low density <1.8 g/cm3, and high‐density >1.8 g/cm3; <38 μm) account for 77%–98% of the OC.

10.1029/2023JD040654,Seasonal Variations and Controls on Triple Oxygen and Hydrogen Isotopes in Precipitation—A Case Study From Monitoring in Southwest China,"Precipitation δ18O has offered valuable insights into the evolution of the Asian monsoon. Recent researches focusing on precipitation Δ′17O has enhanced our understanding by offering new perspectives beyond those of δ18O, revealing insights into vapor sources and continental recycling. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of interannual triple oxygen isotope data, particularly in the Asian monsoon region. In this study, we analyzed the triple oxygen isotopes and hydrogen isotopes in monthly precipitation samples collected from Chongqing in Southwest China between 2019 and 2022 A.D. Seasonal variations in δD, δ18O, δ17O, and d‐excess values were observed, with lower values during the rainy season and higher values during the dry season, highlighting the impact of changes in moisture sources and local meteorological conditions on seasonal shifts in δD, δ18O, and δ17O. While, mean Δ′17O values were higher in rainy season and lower in dry season. Notably, during rainy season, there is a negative correlation between monthly Δ′17O values and the RH of the vapor source area, as well as a positive correlation with d‐excess. Recalculated Δ′17O values based on RH of oceanic moisture source, are higher than the measured values for this period, indicating the contribution of terrigenous moisture to precipitation in SW China. Precipitation Δ′17O values provide a more precise reflection of changes in moisture source, continental recycling, and evapotranspiration processes that drive water cycling compared Integrating modeling works in future will facilitate the use of precipitation Δ′17O values to quantify the impact of different moisture source on precipitation.",Qi‐Sheng Liang;Li‐Juan Sha;Jun‐Yun Li;Jian Zhang;Xue‐Jie Wang;Shi‐Lun Zhou;Fang‐Yuan Lin;Yan‐Xia Xue;Rong Duan;Ya‐Ting He;Hua‐Yan Li;Chen‐Yi Wang;Bao Liu;Yong‐Kang Hou;Chao‐Jun Chen;Hai Cheng;Ting‐Yong Li,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,FALSE,"['precipitation', 'δ18O', 'Δ′17O', 'd-excess', 'moisture source', 'continental recycling', 'evapotranspiration', 'Asian monsoon']",该研究主要关注西南地区降水的三氧同位素和氢同位素的季节变化及其控制因素，通过分析降水样品中的δD、δ18O、δ17O和d-excess值，探讨了降水同位素组成与水汽来源、大陆循环和蒸散过程之间的关系。研究结果表明，降水同位素组成受水汽来源和当地气象条件的影响，而Δ′17O值则可以更精确地反映水汽来源、大陆循环和蒸散过程的变化。该研究主要利用地面观测数据，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

10.1029/2024EF004493,"Estimates of Lake Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Chlorophyll‐a Concentrations to Characterize Harmful Algal Bloom Risk Across the United States","Excess nutrient pollution contributes to the formation of harmful algal blooms (HABs) that compromise fisheries and recreation and that can directly endanger human and animal health via cyanotoxins. Efforts to quantify the occurrence, drivers, and severity of HABs across large areas is difficult due to the resource intensive nature of field monitoring of lake nutrient and chlorophyll‐a concentrations. To better characterize how nutrients interact with other environmental factors to produce algal blooms in freshwater systems, we used spatially explicit and temporally matched climate, landscape, in‐lake characteristic, and nutrient inventory data sets to predict nutrients and chlorophyll‐a across the conterminous US (CONUS). Using a nested modeling approach, three random forest (RF) models were trained to explain the spatiotemporal variation in total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll‐a concentrations across US EPA's National Lakes Assessment (n = 2,062). Concentrations of TN and TP were the most important predictors and, with other variables, the RF model accounted for 68% of variation in chlorophyll‐a. We then used these RF models to extrapolate lake TN and TP predictions to lakes without nutrient observations and predict chlorophyll‐a for ∼112,000 lakes across the CONUS. Risk for high chlorophyll‐a concentrations is highest in the agriculturally dominated Midwest, but other areas of risk emerge in nutrient pollution hot spots across the country. These catchment and lake‐specific results can help managers identify potential nutrient pollution and chlorophyll‐a hot spots that may fuel blooms, prioritize at‐risk lakes for additional monitoring, and optimize management to protect human health and other environmental end goals.",Meredith M.

 Anthropogenic warming is projected to enhance Arctic freshwater exportation into the Labrador Sea. This extra freshwater may weaken deep convection and contribute to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) decline. Here, by analyzing an unprecedented high-resolution climate model simulation for the 21st century, we show that the Labrador Current strongly restricts the lateral spread of freshwater from the Arctic Ocean into the open ocean such that the freshwater input has a limited role in weakening the overturning circulation. In contrast, in the absence of a strong Labrador Current in a climate model with lower resolution, the extra freshwater is allowed to spread into the interior region and eventually shut down deep convection in the Labrador Sea. Given that the Labrador Sea overturning makes a significant contribution to the AMOC in many climate models, our results suggest that the AMOC decline during the 21st century could be overestimated in these models due to the poorly resolved Labrador Current.

10.1038/s41467-024-51753-4,Unlocking multi-photon excited luminescence in pyrazolate trinuclear gold clusters for dynamic cell imaging,"Coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes have potential in diverse applications, but their use in biochemical applications has been limited due to particle size and hydrophobicity. Here, the authors report the development of such complexes with multi-photon luminescent properties for use in cell imaging. 
 The family of coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes exhibits abundant photophysical properties, promising for diverse applications. However, their utility in biochemistry is often hindered by large particle size and strong hydrophobicity. Meanwhile, the investigation into multi-photon excited luminescence within this family remained undocumented, limiting their potential in bio-imaging. Herein, we unveil the multi-photon excited luminescent properties of pyrazolate-based trinuclear gold(I) clusters, facilitated by excimeric gold(I)···gold(I) interactions, revealing a nonlinear optical phenomenon within this family. Furthermore, to address issues of poor biocompatibility, we employ electrospinning coupled with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin as the matrix to fabricate a flexible, durable, transparent, and red emissive film with a photoluminescence quantum yield as high as 88.3%. This strategy not only produces the film with sufficient hydrophilicity and stability, but also achieves the downsizing of trinuclear gold(I) clusters from microscale to nanoscale. Following the instantaneous dissolution of the film in the media, the released trinuclear gold(I) nanoparticles have illuminated cells and bacteria through a real-time, non-toxic, multi-photon bio-imaging approach. This achievement offers a fresh approach for utilizing coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes in biochemical fields. Coinage-metal-based cyclic trinuclear complexes have potential in diverse applications, but their use in biochemical applications has been limited due to particle size and hydrophobicity. Here, the authors report the development of such complexes with multi-photon luminescent properties for use in cell imaging.",Yu-Xin Chen;Haidong Yu;Lihua Wu;Yuan-Jun Tong;Jianqiao Xu;Huan Pang;Chao Wu;Tian Tian;Gangfeng Ouyang,Nature Communications,FALSE,[],该研究主要关注的是利用金纳米簇的多光子激发发光特性进行细胞和细菌的生物成像。研究者通过电纺丝技术结合羟丙基-β-环糊精制备了具有红光发射的柔性、耐用、透明薄膜，并成功地将金纳米簇尺寸从微米级降至纳米级，提高了其生物相容性。该研究为金纳米簇在生物化学领域的应用提供了新的思路，但与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。
10.1038/s41467-024-50916-7,Tropical peat composition may provide a negative feedback on fire occurrence and severity,"Loss of peat through increased burning will have major impacts on the global carbon cycle. Here, the authors use pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry to determine the temperature of maximum thermal decomposition (Tmax) of peats from different latitudes, and couple this to a botanical composition analysis. 
 Loss of peat through increased burning will have major impacts on the global carbon cycle. In a normal hydrological state, the risk of fire propagation is largely controlled by peat bulk density and moisture content. However, where humans have interfered with the moisture status of peat either via drainage, or indirectly via climate change, we hypothesise that its botanical composition will become important to flammability, such that peats from different latitudes might have different compositionally-driven susceptibility to ignition. We use pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry to determine the temperature of maximum thermal decomposition (Tmax) of peats from different latitudes, and couple this to a botanical composition analysis. We find that tropical peat has higher Tmax than other regions, likely on account of its higher wood content which appears to convey a greater resistance to ignition. This resistance also increases with depth, which means that loss of surface peat in tropical regions may lead to a reduction in the subsequent ignitability of deeper peat layers as they are exposed, potentially resulting in a negative feedback on increased fire occurrence and severity.

10.1038/s41467-024-51411-9,Innate immune responses against mRNA vaccine promote cellular immunity through IFN-β at the injection site,"The initial immune response following mRNA vaccine injection is not entirely clear. Here, the authors comprehensively profile injection site responses using single-cell transcriptomics in a mouse model showing activation of major axes of innate immune responses upon and the role of IFN-β to promote cellular immunity. 
 mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have revolutionized vaccine development, but their immunological mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we investigate injection site responses of mRNA vaccines by generating a comprehensive single-cell transcriptome profile upon lipid nanoparticle (LNP) or LNP-mRNA challenge in female BALB/c mice. We show that LNP-induced stromal pro-inflammatory responses and mRNA-elicited type I interferon responses dominate the initial injection site responses. By tracking the fate of delivered mRNA, we discover that injection site fibroblasts are highly enriched with the delivered mRNA and that they express IFN-β specifically in response to the mRNA component, not to the LNP component of mRNA vaccines. Moreover, the mRNA-LNP, but not LNP alone, induces migratory dendritic cells highly expressing IFN-stimulated genes (mDC_ISGs) at the injection site and draining lymph nodes. When co-injected with LNP-subunit vaccine, IFN-β induces mDC_ISGs at the injection site, and importantly, it substantially enhances antigen-specific cellular immune responses. Furthermore, blocking IFN-β signaling at the injection site significantly decreases mRNA vaccine-induced cellular immune responses. Collectively, these data highlight the importance of injection site fibroblasts and IFN-β signaling during early immune responses against the mRNA vaccine and provide detailed information on the initial chain of immune reactions elicited by mRNA vaccine injection. The initial immune response following mRNA vaccine injection is not entirely clear.
