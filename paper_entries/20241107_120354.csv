We performed a comprehensive study with laboratory measurements cooking 19 different dishes and ambient measurements at two Christmas markets measuring various particle properties and trace gases of emissions in real time. Similar emission characteristics were observed for dishes with the same preparation method, mainly due to similar cooking temperature and use of oil, with barbecuing as an especially strong source. 
 Since most people, especially in developed countries, spend most of their time indoors, they are heavily exposed to indoor aerosols, which can potentially lead to adverse health effects. A major source of indoor aerosols are cooking activities, which release large quantities of particulate emissions (in terms of both number and mass), often with complex compositions. To investigate the characteristics of cooking emissions and what influences these emissions, we conducted a comprehensive study by cooking 19 dishes with different ingredients and cooking methods. The emissions were monitored in real time with several online instruments that measured both physical and chemical particle properties as well as trace gas concentrations. The same instrumentation was used to study the influence of cooking emissions on the ambient aerosol load at two German Christmas markets. In contrast to previous studies, which often focus on individual aspects or emission variables, this broad and coherent approach allows a comparison of the influence of different parameters (e.g., ingredients, cooking method, cooking temperature, cooking activities) on the emissions.We found an influence of cooking emissions on six variables: number concentration of smaller (particle diameter dp > 5 nm) and larger (dp > 250 nm) particles, particulate matter (PM: PM1, PM2.5, PM10), black carbon (BC), PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), and organic aerosol mass concentration. In general, similar emission characteristics were observed for dishes with the same cooking method, mainly due to similar cooking temperature and use of oil. The temporal dynamics in the emissions of the aforementioned variables, as well as the sizes of the emitted particles, were mainly influenced by the cooking temperature and the activities during cooking. Emissions were quantified using emission factors, with the highest values for grilled dishes, 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower for oil-based cooking (baking, stir-frying, deep-frying), and the lowest for boiled dishes.For the identification of cooking emissions with the Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), and more generally for the identification of new AMS markers for individual organic aerosol types, we propose a new plot type that takes into account the mass spectral variability for individual aerosol types. Combining our results and those of previous studies for the quantification of cooking-related organic aerosols with the AMS, we recommend the use of relative ionization efficiency values higher than the default value for organics (RIEOrg = 1.4): 2.17 ± 0.48 for rapeseed-oil-based cooking and 5.16 ± 0.77 for soybean-oil-based cooking."

Results show that using CRIs obtained by advanced realistic techniques can improve the accuracy of these measurements, emphasizing the importance of choosing the suitable CRI in atmospheric models. This improvement is crucial for better predicting the dust radiative effect and impact on the climate. 
 Mineral dust significantly influences the Earth's climate system by affecting the radiative balance through the emission, absorption and scattering of solar and terrestrial radiation. Estimating the dust radiative effect remains challenging due to the lack of detailed information on the physical and chemical properties of dust. High-spectral-resolution instruments in the infrared (IR) spectrum, such as the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Instrument (IASI), have demonstrated the ability to quantify these aerosol properties. A crucial parameter for characterizing mineral dust from space is the complex refractive index (CRI), as it links the dust's physical and chemical properties to its optical properties.This paper examines the impact of six prior laboratory CRI datasets to improve the characterization of dust microphysical properties using IASI. The CRIs include older measurements obtained through the classical pellet method, commonly employed in mineral dust applications, as well as newer datasets that incorporate the latest advancements in laboratory measurement techniques for aerosol generation. These datasets are tested on IASI measurements during a dust storm event over the Gobi Desert in May 2017. We evaluate the sensitivity of IASI to different CRI datasets using the Atmospheric Radiation Algorithm for High-Spectral Resolution Measurements from Infrared Spectrometer (ARAHMIS) radiative transfer algorithm and explore the datasets' impact on retrieving size distribution parameters by mapping their spatial distributions. The results indicate that the laboratory CRI datasets decrease the total error in the covariance matrix by 30 %. In addition, we assess the ability to accurately reconstruct IASI detections and the extent to which we can retrieve the microphysical properties of dust particles. The choice of CRI significantly impacts the accuracy of dust detection and characterization from satellite observations. Notably, datasets that incorporate recent aerosol generation techniques with higher spectral resolution and samples from the case study region show improved compatibility with IASI observations. The outcomes of this research emphasize two key points: the crucial link between chemical composition of dust and its optical properties and the importance of considering the specific composition of the CRI dataset for improved retrieval of the microphysical parameters. Furthermore, this study highlights the critical role of ongoing enhancements in CRI measurement approaches, as well as the potential of high-spectral-resolution infrared sounders for aerosol atmospheric investigation and for understanding the radiative impacts of sounders."

The research reveals how uncertainty in the stratosphere is linked to the troposphere. The findings suggest that refining models to better represent the identified sources and impact regions in the troposphere is likely to improve the prediction of the stratosphere and its surface impacts. 
 Variability in the stratosphere, especially extreme events such as sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), can  impact surface weather. Understanding stratospheric prediction uncertainty is therefore crucial for skillful surface weather forecasts on weekly to monthly timescales. Using ECMWF subseasonal hindcasts, this study finds that stratospheric uncertainty is most strongly linked to tropospheric uncertainty over the North Pacific and Northern Europe, regions that can modulate but also respond to stratospheric variability, suggesting a two-way propagation of uncertainty. A case study of the 2018 SSW event shows an initial poleward and upward propagation of uncertainty from tropical convection, followed by a downward propagation where ensemble members that accurately predict the SSW are also better at predicting its downward impacts. These findings highlight the locations in the troposphere that are linked to stratospheric uncertainty and suggest that improved model representation of tropospheric mechanisms linked to  polar vortex variability could enhance both stratospheric  and extratropical surface prediction."

 Propane (C3H8) is an important trace gas in the atmosphere, as it is a proxy for oil and gas production and has a significant impact on atmospheric chemical reactions related to the hydroxyl radical and tropospheric ozone formation. In this study, solar direct absorption spectra near 2967 cm−1 recorded by a ground-based Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) were applied to retrieve C3H8 total columns between June 2018 and July 2022 in Xianghe in north China. The systematic and random uncertainties of the C3H8 column retrieval are estimated to be 18.4 % and 18.1 %, respectively. The mean and standard deviation of the C3H8 columns derived from the FTIR spectra in Xianghe are 1.80 ± 0.81 (1σ) × 1015 molec. cm−2. Good correlations are found between C3H8 and other non-methane hydrocarbons, such as C2H6 (R=0.84) and C2H2 (R=0.79), as well as between C3H8 and CO (R=0.72). However, the correlation between C3H8 and CH4 is relatively weak (R=0.45). Moreover, the FTIR C3H8 measurements in Xianghe are also compared against MkIV measurements at several sites around the world. The new FTIR measurements in Xianghe provide us with insight into C3H8 column variations and the underlying processes in north China."

Chitosan, α-Al2O3, and γ-Al2O3 were tested for quantitative gaseous oxidized mercury sorption in ambient air under laboratory and field conditions. Although these materials sorbed gaseous oxidized mercury without sorbing elemental mercury in the laboratory, less oxidized mercury was recovered from these materials compared to cation exchange membranes in the field. 
 Methodologies for identifying atmospheric oxidized mercury (HgII) compounds, including particulate-bound HgII (HgII(p)) and gaseous oxidized mercury (HgII(g)), by mass spectrometry  are currently under development. This method requires preconcentration of HgII for analysis due to high instrument detection limits relative to ambient HgII concentrations. The objective of this work was to identify and test materials for quantitative capture of HgII from the gas phase and to suggest potential surfaces onto which HgII can be collected, thermally desorbed, and characterized using mass spectrometry methods. From the literature, several compounds were identified as potential sorbent materials and tested in the laboratory for uptake of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) and HgII(g) (permeated from a HgBr2 salt source). Chitosan, α-Al2O3, and γ-Al2O3 demonstrated HgII(g) capture in ambient air laboratory tests, without sorbing Hg0 under the same conditions. When compared to cation exchange membranes (CEMs), chitosan captured a comparable quantity of HgII(g), while ≤90 % of loaded HgII(g) was recovered from α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3. When deployed in the field, the capture efficiency of chitosan decreased compared to CEMs, indicating that environmental conditions impacted the sorption efficiency of this material. The poor recovery of HgII from the tested materials compared to CEMs in the field indicates that further identification and exploration of alternative sorbent materials are required to advance atmospheric mercury chemistry analysis by mass spectrometry methods."

After QC, errors are reduced. The percentile profiles of 3 variables are more reasonable. The overlap ratio between automatic and manual QC results reaches 86 %. The method reduces the human resource cost, helps unify the QC standards. 
 The balloon-borne radiosonde observations provide high-resolution profile observations of pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and winds from the surface to the middle stratosphere. These observations help validate space-based data and are used in climate research, weather forecasting. For the large amount of second-level radiosonde data, it is tedious and time-consuming for the manual quality control (QC). Furthermore, varying experiences and different judgment standards may lead to inconsistent judgments for abnormal data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage QC method for second-level radiosonde data based on the Bezier curve fitting. In the stage QC1, the gross errors are filtered out according to the measurement range of the sensors, the change rates and extreme temperature values based on pressure segmentations. Also, the algorithm of the longest descending sequence(LDS) is used to identify the moment of sounding termination and eliminate items after that moment. In the stage QC2, we score each item with deviations calculated using Bezier curve fitting, and then use a decision tree model ,CART, to identify anomalies in second-level radiosonde data. The experiment results first demonstrate the efficacy of QC at each step, and finally validate the rationality of our method by comparing the statistical characteristics before and after QC. After QC, the error items are greatly reduced, and the percentile profile distribution of temperature, pressure and relative humidity becomes more reasonable. The overlap of items identified by manual QC and automatic QC reaches 86 %, verifying the effectiveness of our method. This research significantly boosts QC efficiency and unifies the QC standards, providing quality assurance for various applications."

The oil palm extent layer was produced using a convolutional neural network that identified industrial and smallholder plantations using Sentinel-1 data. The oil palm planting year was developed using a methodology specifically designed to detect the early stages of oil palm development in the Landsat time series. 
 Oil palm is a controversial crop, primarily because it is associated with negative environmental impacts such as tropical deforestation. Mapping the crop and its characteristics, such as age, is crucial for informing public and policy discussions regarding these impacts. Oil palm has received substantial mapping efforts, but accurate and up-to-date oil palm maps of both extent and age are essential for monitoring impacts and informing concomitant debate. Here, we present a 10 m resolution global map of industrial and smallholder oil palm, developed using Sentinel-1 data for the years 2016–2021 and a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks. In addition, we used Landsat-5, Landsat-7, and Landsat-8 to estimate the planting year from 1990 to 2021 at a 30 m spatial resolution. The planting year indicates the year of establishment of the current (as of 2021) oil palm plantation by means of either newly planted or replanted oil palm in an existing oil palm plantation. We validated the oil palm extent layer using 18 812 randomly distributed reference points. The accuracy of the planting-year layer was assessed using field data collected from 5831 industrial parcels and 1012 smallholder plantations distributed throughout the global oil palm growing area. We found oil palm plantations covering a total mapped area of 23.98 Mha, and our area estimates are 16.82 ± 0.19 Mha of industrial oil palm and 7.37 ± 0.25 Mha of smallholder oil palm worldwide. The producer's and user's accuracy are 91.0 ± 2.5 % and 91.8 ± 1.2 % for industrial plantations and 71.4 ± 0.7 % and 72.4 ± 1.8 % for smallholders; these values represent an improvement compared to a previous global oil palm dataset, particularly in terms of omission of oil palm. The overall mean error between the estimated planting year and the field data was −0.24 years, and the root-mean-square error was 2.65 years, but the agreement was lower for smallholders. Mapping the extent and planting year of smallholder plantations remains challenging, particularly for wild and sparsely planted oil palm, and future mapping efforts should focus on these specific types of plantations. The average oil palm plantation age was 14.1 years, and the area of oil palm over 20 years old was 6.28 Mha. Given that oil palm plantations are typically replanted after 25 years, our findings indicate that this area will require replanting within the coming decade, starting from 2021. Our dataset provides valuable input for optimal land use planning to meet the growing global demand for vegetable oils.

This dataset can enhance understanding of IW dynamics and serve as a valuable resource for studying ocean dynamics, validating numerical models, and advancing AI-driven model building, fostering further exploration into IW phenomena. 
 Internal waves (IWs) are an important ocean phenomenon facilitating energy transfer between multiscale ocean processes. Understanding such processes necessitates the collection and analysis of extensive observational data. IWs predominantly occur in marginal seas, with the South China Sea (SCS) being one of the most active regions, characterized by frequent and large-amplitude IW activities. In this study, we present a comprehensive IW dataset for the northern SCS (https://doi.org/10.12157/IOCAS.20240409.001, Zhang and Li, 2024), covering the area from 112.40 to 121.32° E and from 18.32 to 23.19° N, spanning the period from 2000 to 2022 with a 250 m spatial resolution. During the 22 years, a total of 15 830 MODIS images were downloaded for further processing. Out of these, 3085 high-resolution MODIS true-color images were identified to contain IW information and were included in the dataset with precise IW positions extracted using advanced deep learning techniques. IWs in the northern SCS are categorized into four regions based on extracted IW spatial distributions. This classification enables detailed analyses of IW characteristics, including their spatial and temporal distributions across the entire northern SCS and its specific sub-regions. Interestingly, our temporal analysis reveals characteristic “double-peak” patterns aligned with the lunar day, highlighting the strong connection between IWs and tidal cycles. Furthermore, our spatial analysis identifies two IW quiescent zones within the IW clusters influenced by underwater topography, highlighting regional variations in IW characteristics and suggesting underlying mechanisms which merit further investigation. There are also three gap regions between distinct IW clusters, which may indicate different IW sources. The constructed dataset holds significant potential for studying IW–environment interactions, developing monitoring and prediction models, validating numerical simulations, and serving as an educational resource to promote awareness and interest in IW research."

The model has relatively low computational requirements, and results compare well with near-real-time observations, as well as with results from other existing forecast systems. Results show that with shorter forecast lengths, storm surge and wave predictions can improve in accuracy. 
 A real-time forecast model of surface hydrodynamics in Lake Ontario (Coastlines-LO) was developed to automatically predict storm surges and surface waves. The system uses a dynamically coupled Delft3D–SWAN model with a structured grid to generate 48 h predictions for the lake that are updated every 6 h. The lake surface is forced with meteorological data from the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS). The forecast model has been running since May 2021, capturing a wide variety of storm conditions. Good agreement between observations and modelled results is achieved, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) for water levels and waves under 0.02 and 0.26 m, respectively. During storm events, the magnitude and timing of storm surges are accurately predicted at nine monitoring stations (RMSE <0.05 m), with model accuracy either improving or remaining consistent with decreasing forecast length. Forecast significant wave heights agree with observed data (1 %–12 % relative error for peak wave heights) at four wave buoys in the lake. Coastlines-LO forecasts for storm surge prediction for two consecutive storm events were compared to those from the Great Lakes Coastal Forecasting System (GLCFS) to further evaluate model performance. Both systems achieved comparable results with average RMSEs of 0.02 m. Coastlines-LO is an open-source wrapper code driven by open data and has relatively low computational requirements compared to GLCFS, making this approach suitable for forecasting marine conditions in other coastal regions."

Stubenrauch,Assessment of object-based indices to identify convective organization,"In recent years, several studies focused their attention on the disposition of convection. Lots of methods, called indices, have been developed to quantify the amount of convection clustering. These indices are evaluated in this study by defining criteria that must be satisfied and then evaluating the indices against these standards. None of the indices meet all criteria, with some only partially meeting them. 
 The emerging field of convective organization has attracted significant attention due to its potential implications for weather and climate. Numerous indices have been developed to identify organization of convection, serving as essential tools for advancing our understanding in this area. Because of the large number of these indices, many results on convective organization are still uncertain, and different studies have shown diverging results. The present analysis studies and compares nine object-based indices in order to evaluate their ability to quantify organization. The analysis begins by establishing a set of criteria expected for convective organization and subsequently subjecting the indices to assessment against these benchmarks. The criteria are grouped into three categories. The first category tests the robustness of the indices against noise. The second category evaluates their sensitivity to the size and position of the convective objects. The third category assesses their dependency on the specific characteristics of the dataset in use. Among the indices scrutinized, none fulfill all the desired conditions, and some conditions are only marginally satisfied. Therefore, we developed a new index, called the Organization Index based on Distance and Relative Area (OIDRA), as an example of a well-behaving index. The unmet conditions and differences between indices can explain the discord between different organization studies. The results come down to a guideline that will help to advance our description of deep convective organization."

Keutsch;Thomas Peter;Gabriel Chiodo,A fully coupled solid-particle microphysics scheme for stratospheric aerosol injections within the aerosol–chemistry–climate model SOCOL-AERv2,"We quantified impacts and efficiency of stratospheric solar climate intervention via solid particle injection. Microphysical interactions of solid particles with the sulfur cycle were interactively coupled to the heterogeneous chemistry scheme and the radiative transfer code of an aerosol–chemistry–climate model. Compared to injection of SO2 we only find a stronger cooling efficiency for solid particles when normalizing to the aerosol load but not when normalizing to the injection rate. 
 Recent studies have suggested that injection of solid particles such as alumina and calcite particles for stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) instead of sulfur-based injections could reduce some of the adverse side effects of SAI such as ozone depletion and stratospheric heating. Here, we present a version of the global aerosol–chemistry–climate model SOCOL-AERv2 and the Earth system model (ESM) SOCOLv4 which incorporate a solid-particle microphysics scheme for assessment of SAI of solid particles. Microphysical interactions of the solid particle with the stratospheric sulfur cycle were interactively coupled to the heterogeneous chemistry scheme and the radiative transfer code (RTC) for the first time within an ESM. Therefore, the model allows simulation of heterogeneous chemistry at the particle surface as well as feedbacks between microphysics, chemistry, radiation and climate. We show that sulfur-based SAI results in a doubling of the stratospheric aerosol burden compared to the same mass injection rate of calcite and alumina particles with a radius of 240 nm. Most of the sulfuric acid aerosol mass resulting from SO2 injection does not need to be lifted to the stratosphere but is formed after in situ oxidation and subsequent water uptake in the stratosphere. Therefore, to achieve the same radiative forcing, larger injection rates are needed for calcite and alumina particle injection than for sulfur-based SAI. The stratospheric sulfur cycle would be significantly perturbed, with a reduction in stratospheric sulfuric acid burden by 53 %, when injecting 5 Mt yr−1 (megatons per year) of alumina or calcite particles of 240 nm radius. We show that alumina particles will acquire a sulfuric acid coating equivalent to about 10 nm thickness if the sulfuric acid is equally distributed over the whole available particle surface area in the lower stratosphere. However, due to the steep contact angle of sulfuric acid on alumina particles, the sulfuric acid coating would likely not cover the entire alumina surface, which would result in available surface for heterogeneous reactions other than the ones on sulfuric acid. When applying realistic uptake coefficients of 1.0, 10−5 and 10−4 for H2SO4, HCl and HNO3, respectively, the same scenario with injections of calcite particles results in 94 % of the particle mass remaining in the form of CaCO3. This likely keeps the optical properties of the calcite particles intact but could significantly alter the heterogeneous reactions occurring on the particle surfaces. The major process uncertainties of solid-particle SAI are (1) the solid-particle microphysics in the injection plume and degree of agglomeration of solid particles on the sub-ESM grid scale, (2) the scattering properties of the resulting agglomerates, (3) heterogeneous chemistry on the particle surface, and (4) aerosol–cloud interactions. These uncertainties can only be addressed with extensive, coordinated experimental and modelling research efforts. The model presented in this work offers a useful tool for sensitivity studies and incorporating new experimental results on SAI of solid particles."

In this study, the accuracy of SBM-based precipitation type diagnosis is compared with other traditional methods. SBM have relatively higher accuracy about snow and wetsnow events whereas lower accuracy about rain event. When microphysics scheme in the SBM was optimized for the corresponding region, accuracy about rain events was improved. 
 Winter precipitation types (WPTs) are controlled by many factors, including thermodynamic and microphysical processes. Therefore, realistically simulating interactions between precipitation particles and the atmosphere is important when diagnosing the WPT. In the present study, we analyze the performance of the one-dimensional spectral bin model (SBM) developed by Carlin and Ryzhkov (2019), which simulates the change in the physical characteristics of precipitation particles of various sizes as they fall from the cloud top to the ground and diagnoses surface WPT. We compare the performance of the SBM and four other diagnostic methods that use the following variables: 1) atmospheric thickness, 2) wet-bulb temperature, 3) temperature and relative humidity, and 4) wet-bulb temperature and low-level lapse rate. Three reference WPTs (snow [SN], rain [RA], and RASN) are obtained from particle size velocity (PARSIVEL) disdrometer data using a newly proposed decision algorithm. The results show that the SBM has the highest overall skill score for winter precipitation, especially at the mountain sites. In contrast, the skill score of the SBM is lower than the other methods for RA. These results indicate that the SBM simulations tend to underestimate melting compared to observations. We thus explore the effects of the SBM’s microphysics scheme on the extent of melting in cases of misdiagnosed RA. An optimized SBM that uses the climatological snow density‑diameter relationship for the Pyeongchang region produces an increased amount of melting and achieves an improved skill score compared to the original SBM, which uses climatological relationships for Colorado region."

However, the mechanisms behind this process are predominantly linked to direct O2 activation by reduced substances such as Fe(II) and natural organic matter. In this study, we introduce a previously overlooked dual-ligand mechanism that significantly amplifies ·OH generation on iron oxyhydroxides, facilitated by cysteine and pyrophosphate. Our findings reveal that these ligands collaboratively boost ·OH generation by 99.5–125.7% compared to Fe(II) alone. This enhancement occurs through a two-step electron transfer (ET) process, where cysteine transfers electrons to O2 through iron oxyhydroxides. The complexation of pyrophosphate with iron oxyhydroxides further reduces the thermodynamic barriers, notably promoting this ET process and significantly improving the electron utilization efficiency for O2 activation by the electron donor cysteine. Such a process has shown its great potential for effectively driving the oxidative transformation of various pollutants, including As(III), dichlorophenol, and carbamazepine. These findings offer valuable insights for nature-based pollutant mitigation in soil and subsurface environments."

At 40 °C, the 0.9PPD-Cu/CA presented a 100% COS conversion efficiency in the presence of H2O; meanwhile, the N doping realized the enhancement of basic density, leading to an improved COS conversion, and the intermediates H2S in the reaction were wholly adsorbed, implying that 0.9PPD-Cu/CA was a bifunctional carbon material. Furthermore, the Hg0 addition achieved a synergistic performance as well as higher COS yield and a significant lifetime period, in which the sulfur immediate could have a high reactive activity for Hg0 and the sulfate proportion would be alleviated as well. Subsequently, the catalyst poisoning would be alleviated after the protection of the collaborative process by strengthening the electron transfer, consuming the sulfur-based products, and accelerating the cleavage of the H–S bond.

Are these climate phenomena of the two regions physically connected? If yes, what are the responsible dynamical mechanisms involved? Utilizing the ERA5 reanalysis data and model simulations, this study reveals a significant seesaw variation in the convection and temperature trends between WP and ME. When convective heating intensifies over the WP, the ME tends to be drier and hotter during the spring, and vice versa. A further investigation indicates that the enhanced WP convective heating can induce anticyclonic circulation anomalies in the upper and middle troposphere over the Iranian and Tibetan plateaus. These anomalous high pressures extend westward, exhibiting a barotropic structure, which leads to stronger sinking motions, reduced cloud cover, and increased surface solar radiation over the ME. Consequently, these conditions result in drier and hotter soils and an increase in heatwave days in the ME. This study provides useful information for enhancing our understanding of the role of tropical WP climate change in influencing the upstream climate conditions with a focus on the ME."

We used negative and positive ion electrospray ionization Fourier‐transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT‐ICR MS) to identify differences in the molecular compositions of gas and particle phase samples from urban atmosphere. We aimed to identify intrinsic chemical parameters that determine and predict the organic aerosol volatility. We found higher average molecular weights, carbon mass percentages, and double bond equivalents (DBE) but lower average O/C ratios and oxygen mass percentages in the particle phase than the gas phase. We identified DBE, which display a significant negative correlation with volatility, as a key parameter. We proposed to improve the previous model for predicting organic aerosol volatility by incorporating DBE as a new variant; and the result showed that this subsequently improved the accuracy of the model, particularly for compounds with minimal or no heteroatoms (0–2) such as hydrocarbons (CH). The revised model offers insights into the contributions of DBE, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms to the volatilities of diverse organic molecules in aerosols and could be applied to improve our understanding of the phase distributions of volatile organic compounds in the ambient air."

Latitude‐altitude dependent spectra are derived from correlations of interannual H2O anomalies with respect to the tropical tropopause source region, fitted with an inverse Gaussian distribution function. The reconstructions accurately capture interannual H2O variability in the “tropical pipe” and near‐global lower stratosphere, regions of relatively fast transport (∼1–2 years) in the Brewer‐Dobson circulation. The calculations provide novel observational estimates of the corresponding “short transit‐time” part of the age spectrum in these regions, including the mode. However, the H2O results do not constrain the longer transit‐time “tail” of the age spectra, and the mean age of air and spectral widths are systematically underestimated compared to other data. We compare observational results with parallel calculations applied to the WACCM chemistry‐climate model and the CLaMS chemistry‐transport model, and additionally evaluate the method in CLaMS by comparing with spectra from idealized pulse tracers. Because the age spectra accurately capture H2O interannual variations originating from the tropical tropopause, they can be used to identify “other” sources of variability in the lower stratosphere, and we use these calculations to quantify H2O anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere linked to the Australian New Years fires in early 2020 and the Hunga volcanic eruption in 2022."

Rainville,Seasonal and Local Time Variation in the Observed Peak of the Meteor Altitude Distributions by Meteor Radars,"Meteoroids of sub‐milligram sizes burn up high in the Earth's atmosphere and cause streaks of plasma trails detectable by meteor radars. The altitude at which these trails, or meteors, form depends on a number of factors including atmospheric density and the astronomical source populations from which these meteoroids originate. A previous study has shown that the altitude of these meteors is affected by long‐term linear trends and the 11‐year solar cycle related to changes in our atmosphere. In this work, we examine how shorter diurnal and seasonal variations in the altitude distribution of meteors are dependent on the geographical location at which the measurements are performed. We use meteoroid altitude data from 18 independent meteor radar stations at a broad range of latitudes and investigate whether there are local time (LT) and seasonal variations in the altitude of the peak meteor height, defined as the majority detection altitude of all meteors within a certain period, which differ from those expected purely from the variation in the visibility of their astronomical source. We find a consistent LT and seasonal response for the Northern Hemisphere locations regardless of latitude. However, the Southern Hemisphere locations exhibit much greater LT and seasonal variation. In particular, we find a complex response in the four stations located within the Southern Andes region, which indicates that the strong dynamical atmospheric activity, such as the gravity waves prevalent here, disrupts, and masks the seasonality and dependence on the astronomical sources."

Our analysis shows that the distribution of daily Arctic SAT changes substantially, with Arctic mean temperatures being distinguishable from pre‐industrial levels on 84% and 97% of days at 1.5 and 2°C of global warming, respectively, and on virtually every day at 3°C of global warming. This shift is primarily due to the rapid rise in average temperature resulting from Arctic amplification and is exacerbated by a decrease in the variability of daily Arctic SAT of approximately 8.5% per degree of global warming. The changes in mean temperature and variability are more pronounced in the cold seasons than in summer, resulting in a weakened and shifted seasonal cycle of Arctic SAT. Moreover, the intensity and frequency of warm and cold extreme events change to varying degrees. The hottest days warm slightly more, while the coldest days warm 4–5 times more than the global average temperature, making extreme cold events rare. Changes in local SAT vary regionally across the Arctic and are most significant in areas of sea‐ice loss. Our findings underscore the Arctic's amplified sensitivity to global warming and emphasize the urgent need to limit global warming to mitigate impacts on human and natural systems."

Researchers have developed modeling approaches to resolve source‐specific exposure for application in exposure assessments, epidemiology, risk assessments, and environmental justice. We explore six source‐specific air pollution exposure assessment approaches: Photochemical Grid Models (PGMs), Data‐Driven Statistical Models, Dispersion Models, Reduced Complexity chemical transport Models (RCMs), Receptor Models, and Proximity Exposure Estimation Models. These models have been applied to estimate exposure from sources such as on‐road vehicles, power plants, industrial sources, and wildfires. We categorize these models based on their approaches for assessing emissions and atmospheric processes (e.g., statistical or first principles), their exposure units (direct physical measures or indirect measures/scaled indices), and their temporal and spatial scales. While most of the studies we discuss are from the United States, the methodologies and models are applicable to other countries and regions. We recommend identifying the key physical processes that determine exposure from a given source and using a model that sufficiently accounts for these processes. For instance, PGMs use first principles parameterizations of atmospheric processes and provide source impacts exposure variability in concentration units, although approaches within PGMs for source attribution introduce uncertainties relative to the base model and are difficult to evaluate. Evaluation is important but difficult—since source‐specific exposure is difficult to observe, the most direct evaluation methods involve comparisons with alternative models."

 The chromosomal theory of inheritance dictates that genes on the same chromosome segregate together while genes on different chromosomes assort independently1. Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are common in cancer and drive oncogene amplification, dysregulated gene expression and intratumoural heterogeneity through random segregation during cell division2,3. Distinct ecDNA sequences, termed ecDNA species, can co-exist to facilitate intermolecular cooperation in cancer cells4. How multiple ecDNA species within a tumour cell are assorted and maintained across somatic cell generations is unclear. Here we show that cooperative ecDNA species are coordinately inherited through mitotic co-segregation. Imaging and single-cell analyses show that multiple ecDNAs encoding distinct oncogenes co-occur and are correlated in copy number in human cancer cells. ecDNA species are coordinately segregated asymmetrically during mitosis, resulting in daughter cells with simultaneous copy-number gains in multiple ecDNA species before any selection. Intermolecular proximity and active transcription at the start of mitosis facilitate the coordinated segregation of ecDNA species, and transcription inhibition reduces co-segregation. Computational modelling reveals the quantitative principles of ecDNA co-segregation and co-selection, predicting their observed distributions in cancer cells. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs enables co-amplification of specialized ecDNAs containing only enhancer elements and guides therapeutic strategies to jointly deplete cooperating ecDNA oncogenes. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs confers stability to oncogene cooperation and novel gene regulatory circuits, allowing winning combinations of epigenetic states to be transmitted across cell generations.

 Ion-conducting polymer membranes are essential in many separation processes and electrochemical devices, including electrodialysis1, redox flow batteries2, fuel cells3 and electrolysers4,5. Controlling ion transport and selectivity in these membranes largely hinges on the manipulation of pore size. Although membrane pore structures can be designed in the dry state6, they are redefined upon hydration owing to swelling in electrolyte solutions. Strategies to control pore hydration and a deeper understanding of pore structure evolution are vital for accurate pore size tuning. Here we report polymer membranes containing pendant groups of varying hydrophobicity, strategically positioned near charged groups to regulate their hydration capacity and pore swelling. Modulation of the hydrated micropore size (less than two nanometres) enables direct control over water and ion transport across broad length scales, as quantified by spectroscopic and computational methods. Ion selectivity improves in hydration-restrained pores created by more hydrophobic pendant groups. These highly interconnected ion transport channels, with tuned pore gate sizes, show higher ionic conductivity and orders-of-magnitude lower permeation rates of redox-active species compared with conventional membranes, enabling stable cycling of energy-dense aqueous organic redox flow batteries. This pore size tailoring approach provides a promising avenue to membranes with precisely controlled ionic and molecular transport functions.

Cooper,Autonomous mobile robots for exploratory synthetic chemistry,"A modular autonomous platform for general exploratory synthetic chemistry uses mobile robots to integrate an automated synthesis platform and two analysis platforms. 
 Autonomous laboratories can accelerate discoveries in chemical synthesis, but this requires automated measurements coupled with reliable decision-making1,2. Most autonomous laboratories involve bespoke automated equipment3–6, and reaction outcomes are often assessed using a single, hard-wired characterization technique7. Any decision-making algorithms8 must then operate using this narrow range of characterization data9,10. By contrast, manual experiments tend to draw on a wider range of instruments to characterize reaction products, and decisions are rarely taken based on one measurement alone. Here we show that a synthesis laboratory can be integrated into an autonomous laboratory by using mobile robots11–13 that operate equipment and make decisions in a human-like way. Our modular workflow combines mobile robots, an automated synthesis platform, a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometer and a benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. This allows robots to share existing laboratory equipment with human researchers without monopolizing it or requiring extensive redesign. A heuristic decision-maker processes the orthogonal measurement data, selecting successful reactions to take forward and automatically checking the reproducibility of any screening hits. We exemplify this approach in the three areas of structural diversification chemistry, supramolecular host–guest chemistry and photochemical synthesis. This strategy is particularly suited to exploratory chemistry that can yield multiple potential products, as for supramolecular assemblies, where we also extend the method to an autonomous function assay by evaluating host–guest binding properties.

 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events detected from beyond the Milky Way. FRB emission characteristics favour highly magnetized neutron stars, or magnetars, as the sources1, as evidenced by FRB-like bursts from a galactic magnetar2,3, and the star-forming nature of FRB host galaxies4,5. However, the processes that produce FRB sources remain unknown6. Although galactic magnetars are often linked to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe)7, it is uncertain what determines which supernovae result in magnetars. The galactic environments of FRB sources can be used to investigate their progenitors. Here, we present the stellar population properties of 30 FRB host galaxies discovered by the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110). Our analysis shows a marked deficit of low-mass FRB hosts compared with the occurrence of star formation in the Universe, implying that FRBs are a biased tracer of star formation, preferentially selecting massive star-forming galaxies. This bias may be driven by galaxy metallicity, which is positively correlated with stellar mass8. Metal-rich environments may favour the formation of magnetar progenitors through stellar mergers9,10, as higher-metallicity stars are less compact and more likely to fill their Roche lobes, leading to unstable mass transfer. Although massive stars do not have convective interiors to generate strong magnetic fields by dynamo11, merger remnants are thought to have the requisite internal magnetic-field strengths to result in magnetars11,12. The preferential occurrence of FRBs in massive star-forming galaxies suggests that a core-collapse supernova of merger remnants preferentially forms magnetars.

 To flexibly adapt to new situations, our brains must understand the regularities in the world, as well as those in our own patterns of behaviour. A wealth of findings is beginning to reveal the algorithms that we use to map the outside world1–6. However, the biological algorithms that map the complex structured behaviours that we compose to reach our goals remain unknown. Here we reveal a neuronal implementation of an algorithm for mapping abstract behavioural structure and transferring it to new scenarios. We trained mice on many tasks that shared a common structure (organizing a sequence of goals) but differed in the specific goal locations. The mice discovered the underlying task structure, enabling zero-shot inferences on the first trial of new tasks. The activity of most neurons in the medial frontal cortex tiled progress to goal, akin to how place cells map physical space. These ‘goal-progress cells’ generalized, stretching and compressing their tiling to accommodate different goal distances. By contrast, progress along the overall sequence of goals was not encoded explicitly. Instead, a subset of goal-progress cells was further tuned such that individual neurons fired with a fixed task lag from a particular behavioural step. Together, these cells acted as task-structured memory buffers, implementing an algorithm that instantaneously encoded the entire sequence of future behavioural steps, and whose dynamics automatically computed the appropriate action at each step. These dynamics mirrored the abstract task structure both on-task and during offline sleep.

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors are widely used anticancer therapies1 that can cause morbid and potentially fatal immune-related adverse events such as immune-related myocarditis (irMyocarditis)2–5. The pathogenesis of irMyocarditis and its relationship to antitumour immunity remain poorly understood. Here we sought to define immune responses in heart, tumour and blood in patients with irMyocarditis by leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, microscopy and proteomics analyses of samples from 28 patients with irMyocarditis and 41 unaffected individuals. Analyses of 84,576 cardiac cells by single-cell RNA sequencing combined with multiplexed microscopy demonstrated increased frequencies and co-localization of cytotoxic T cells, conventional dendritic cells and inflammatory fibroblasts in irMyocarditis heart tissue. Analyses of 366,066 blood cells revealed decreased frequencies of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conventional dendritic cells and B lineage cells but an increased frequency of other mononuclear phagocytes in irMyocarditis. Fifty-two heart-expanded TCR clones from eight patients did not recognize the putative cardiac autoantigens α-myosin, troponin I or troponin T. Additionally, TCRs enriched in heart tissue were largely nonoverlapping with those enriched in paired tumour tissue. The presence of heart-expanded TCRs in a cycling blood CD8 T cell population was associated with fatal irMyocarditis case status. Collectively, these findings highlight crucial biology driving irMyocarditis and identify putative biomarkers.

 Persister cells, rare phenotypic variants that survive normally lethal levels of antibiotics, present a major barrier to clearing bacterial infections1. However, understanding the precise physiological state and genetic basis of persister formation has been a longstanding challenge. Here we generated a high-resolution single-cell2 RNA atlas of Escherichia coli growth transitions, which revealed that persisters from diverse genetic and physiological models converge to transcriptional states that are distinct from standard growth phases and instead exhibit a dominant signature of translational deficiency. We then used ultra-dense CRISPR interference3 to determine how every E. coli gene contributes to persister formation across genetic models. Among critical genes with large effects, we found lon, which encodes a highly conserved protease4, and yqgE, a poorly characterized gene whose product strongly modulates the duration of post-starvation dormancy and persistence. Our work reveals key physiologic and genetic factors that underlie starvation-triggered persistence, a critical step towards targeting persisters in recalcitrant bacterial infections.

 The yeast SWR1 complex catalyses the exchange of histone H2A–H2B dimers in nucleosomes, with Htz1–H2B dimers1–3. Here we used single-molecule analysis to demonstrate two-step double exchange of the two H2A–H2B dimers in a canonical yeast nucleosome with Htz1–H2B dimers, and showed that double exchange can be processive without release of the nucleosome from the SWR1 complex. Further analysis showed that bound nucleosomes flip between two states, with each presenting a different face, and hence histone dimer, to SWR1. The bound dwell time is longer when an H2A–H2B dimer is presented for exchange than when presented with an Htz1–H2B dimer. A hexasome intermediate in the reaction is bound to the SWR1 complex in a single orientation with the ‘empty’ site presented for dimer insertion. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed different populations of complexes showing nucleosomes caught ‘flipping’ between different conformations without release, each placing a different dimer into position for exchange, with the Swc2 subunit having a key role in this process. Together, the data reveal a processive mechanism for double dimer exchange that explains how SWR1 can ‘proofread’ the dimer identities within nucleosomes.

 Somatic alterations in the oncogenic kinase AKT1 have been identified in a broad spectrum of solid tumours. The most common AKT1 alteration replaces Glu17 with Lys (E17K) in the regulatory pleckstrin homology domain1, resulting in constitutive membrane localization and activation of oncogenic signalling. In clinical studies, pan-AKT inhibitors have been found to cause dose-limiting hyperglycaemia2–6, which has motivated the search for mutant-selective inhibitors. We exploited the E17K mutation to design allosteric, lysine-targeted salicylaldehyde inhibitors with selectivity for AKT1 (E17K) over wild-type AKT paralogues, a major challenge given the presence of three conserved lysines near the allosteric site. Crystallographic analysis of the covalent inhibitor complex unexpectedly revealed an adventitious tetrahedral zinc ion that coordinates two proximal cysteines in the kinase activation loop while simultaneously engaging the E17K–imine conjugate. The salicylaldimine complex with AKT1 (E17K), but not that with wild-type AKT1, recruits endogenous Zn2+ in cells, resulting in sustained inhibition. A salicylaldehyde-based inhibitor was efficacious in AKT1 (E17K) tumour xenograft models at doses that did not induce hyperglycaemia. Our study demonstrates the potential to achieve exquisite residence-time-based selectivity for AKT1 (E17K) by targeting the mutant lysine together with Zn2+ chelation by the resulting salicylaldimine adduct.

 Neuropeptides have important roles in neural plasticity, spiking and behaviour1. Yet, many fundamental questions remain regarding their spatiotemporal transmission, integration and functions in the awake brain. Here we examined how MC4R-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVHMC4R) integrate neuropeptide signals to modulate feeding-related fast synaptic transmission and titrate the transition to satiety2–6. We show that hunger-promoting AgRP axons release the neuropeptide NPY to decrease the second messenger cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons, while satiety-promoting POMC axons release the neuropeptide αMSH to increase cAMP. Each release event is all-or-none, stochastic and can impact multiple neurons within an approximately 100-µm-diameter region. After release, NPY and αMSH peptides compete to control cAMP—the amplitude and persistence of NPY signalling is blunted by high αMSH in the fed state, while αMSH signalling is blunted by high NPY in the fasted state. Feeding resolves this competition by simultaneously elevating αMSH release and suppressing NPY release7,8, thereby sustaining elevated cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons throughout a meal. In turn, elevated cAMP facilitates potentiation of feeding-related excitatory inputs with each bite to gradually promote satiation across many minutes. Our findings highlight biochemical modes of peptide signal integration and information accumulation to guide behavioural state transitions.

 Hypoxic cancer cells resist many antineoplastic therapies and can seed recurrence1,2. We previously found that either deficiency or inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP1B) promotes human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer cell death in hypoxia by activation of RNF213 (ref. 3), a large protein with multiple AAA-ATPase domains and two ubiquitin ligase domains (RING and RZ) implicated in Moyamoya disease, lipotoxicity and innate immunity4. Here we report that PTP1B and ABL1/2 reciprocally control RNF213 tyrosine phosphorylation and, consequently, its oligomerization and RZ domain activation. The RZ domain ubiquitylates and induces the degradation of the major NF-κB regulator CYLD/SPATA2. Decreased CYLD/SPATA2 levels lead to NF-κB activation and induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome which, together with hypoxia-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggers pyroptotic cell death. Consistent with this model, CYLD deletion phenocopies, whereas NLRP3 deletion blocks, the effects of PTP1B deficiency on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer xenograft growth. Reconstitution studies with RNF213 mutants confirm that the RZ domain mediates tumour cell death. In concert, our results identify a unique, potentially targetable PTP1B–RNF213–CYLD–SPATA2 pathway critical for the control of inflammatory cell death in hypoxic tumours, provide new insights into RNF213 regulation and have potential implications for the pathogenesis of Moyamoya disease, inflammatory disorders and autoimmune disease.

 All animals develop from a single-celled zygote into a complex multicellular organism through a series of precisely orchestrated processes1,2. Despite the remarkable conservation of early embryogenesis across animals, the evolutionary origins of how and when this process first emerged remain elusive. Here, by combining time-resolved imaging and transcriptomic profiling, we show that single cells of the ichthyosporean Chromosphaera perkinsii—a close relative that diverged from animals about 1 billion years ago3,4—undergo symmetry breaking and develop through cleavage divisions to produce a prolonged multicellular colony with distinct co-existing cell types. Our findings about the autonomous and palintomic developmental program of C. perkinsii hint that such multicellular development either is much older than previously thought or evolved convergently in ichthyosporeans.

 The mechanisms underlying the mammalian ultradian sleep rhythm—the alternation of rapid-eye-movement (REM) and slow-wave (SW) states—are not well understood but probably depend, at least in part, on circuits in the brainstem1–6. Here, we use perturbation experiments to probe this ultradian rhythm in sleeping lizards (Pogona vitticeps)7–9 and test the hypothesis that it originates in a central pattern generator10,11—circuits that are typically susceptible to phase-dependent reset and entrainment by external stimuli12. Using light pulses, we find that Pogona’s ultradian rhythm8 can be reset in a phase-dependent manner, with a critical transition from phase delay to phase advance in the middle of SW. The ultradian rhythm frequency can be decreased or increased, within limits, by entrainment with light pulses. During entrainment, Pogona REM (REMP) can be shortened but not lengthened, whereas SW can be dilated more flexibly. In awake animals, a few alternating light/dark epochs matching natural REMP and SW durations entrain a sleep-like brain rhythm, suggesting the transient activation of an ultradian rhythm generator. In sleeping animals, a light pulse delivered to a single eye causes an immediate ultradian rhythm reset, but only of the contralateral hemisphere; both sides resynchronize spontaneously, indicating that sleep is controlled by paired rhythm-generating circuits linked by functional excitation. Our results indicate that central pattern generators of a type usually known to control motor rhythms may also organize the ultradian sleep rhythm in a vertebrate.

 The digitization of health records and growing availability of tumour DNA sequencing provide an opportunity to study the determinants of cancer outcomes with unprecedented richness. Patient data are often stored in unstructured text and siloed datasets. Here we combine natural language processing annotations1,2 with structured medication, patient-reported demographic, tumour registry and tumour genomic data from 24,950 patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to generate a clinicogenomic, harmonized oncologic real-world dataset (MSK-CHORD). MSK-CHORD includes data for non-small-cell lung (n = 7,809), breast (n = 5,368), colorectal (n = 5,543), prostate (n = 3,211) and pancreatic (n = 3,109) cancers and enables discovery of clinicogenomic relationships not apparent in smaller datasets. Leveraging MSK-CHORD to train machine learning models to predict overall survival, we find that models including features derived from natural language processing, such as sites of disease, outperform those based on genomic data or stage alone as tested by cross-validation and an external, multi-institution dataset. By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of automated annotation from unstructured notes and its utility in predicting patient outcomes.

 Crystalline solids typically show robust long-range structural ordering, vital for their remarkable electronic properties and use in functional electronics, albeit with limited customization space. By contrast, synthetic molecular systems provide highly tunable structural topologies and versatile functionalities but are often too delicate for scalable electronic integration. Combining these two systems could harness the strengths of both, yet realizing this integration is challenging owing to distinct chemical bonding structures and processing conditions. Two-dimensional atomic crystals comprise crystalline atomic layers separated by non-bonding van der Waals gaps, allowing diverse atomic or molecular intercalants to be inserted without disrupting existing covalent bonds. This enables the creation of a diverse set of layered hybrid superlattices (LHSLs) composed of alternating crystalline atomic layers of variable electronic properties and self-assembled atomic or molecular interlayers featuring customizable chemical compositions and structural motifs. Here we outline strategies to prepare LHSLs and discuss emergent properties. With the versatile molecular design strategies and modular assembly processes, LHSLs offer vast flexibility for weaving distinct chemical constituents and quantum properties into monolithic artificial solids with a designable three-dimensional potential landscape. This opens unprecedented opportunities to tailor charge correlations, quantum properties and topological phases, thereby defining a rich material platform for advancing quantum information science.

Thompson,Cellular ATP demand creates metabolically distinct subpopulations of mitochondria,"Mitochondria are able to maintain two competing metabolic pathways—oxidative phosphorylation and the reductive synthesis of proline and ornithine—by generating two mitochondrial subpopulations that are enriched in either pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase or ATP synthase. 
 Mitochondria serve a crucial role in cell growth and proliferation by supporting both ATP synthesis and the production of macromolecular precursors. Whereas oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depends mainly on the oxidation of intermediates from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the mitochondrial production of proline and ornithine relies on reductive synthesis1. How these competing metabolic pathways take place in the same organelle is not clear. Here we show that when cellular dependence on OXPHOS increases, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS)—the rate-limiting enzyme in the reductive synthesis of proline and ornithine—becomes sequestered in a subset of mitochondria that lack cristae and ATP synthase. This sequestration is driven by both the intrinsic ability of P5CS to form filaments and the mitochondrial fusion and fission cycle. Disruption of mitochondrial dynamics, by impeding mitofusin-mediated fusion or dynamin-like-protein-1-mediated fission, impairs the separation of P5CS-containing mitochondria from mitochondria that are enriched in cristae and ATP synthase. Failure to segregate these metabolic pathways through mitochondrial fusion and fission results in cells either sacrificing the capacity for OXPHOS while sustaining the reductive synthesis of proline, or foregoing proline synthesis while preserving adaptive OXPHOS. These findings provide evidence of the key role of mitochondrial fission and fusion in maintaining both oxidative and reductive biosyntheses in response to changing nutrient availability and bioenergetic demand. Mitochondria are able to maintain two competing metabolic pathways—oxidative phosphorylation and the reductive synthesis of proline and ornithine—by generating two mitochondrial subpopulations that are enriched in either pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase or ATP synthase."

 Persistent, memorandum-specific neuronal spiking activity has long been hypothesized to underlie working memory1,2. However, emerging evidence suggests a potential role for ‘activity-silent’ synaptic mechanisms3–5. This issue remains controversial because evidence for either view has largely relied either on datasets that fail to capture single-trial population dynamics or on indirect measures of neuronal spiking. We addressed this controversy by examining the dynamics of mnemonic information on single trials obtained from large, local populations of lateral prefrontal neurons recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing a working memory task. Here we show that mnemonic information does not persist in the spiking activity of neuronal populations during memory delays, but instead alternates between coordinated ‘On’ and ‘Off’ states. At the level of single neurons, Off states are driven by both a loss of selectivity for memoranda and a return of firing rates to spontaneous levels. Further exploiting the large-scale recordings used here, we show that mnemonic information is available in the patterns of functional connections among neuronal ensembles during Off states. Our results suggest that intermittent periods of memorandum-specific spiking coexist with synaptic mechanisms to support working memory. By recording large populations of neurons in behaving monkeys using newly developed silicon probes, we show that intermittent periods of memorandum-specific spiking coexist with synaptic mechanisms to support working memory. "

 Atomic nuclei are self-organized, many-body quantum systems bound by strong nuclear forces within femtometre-scale space. These complex systems manifest a variety of shapes1–3, traditionally explored using non-invasive spectroscopic techniques at low energies4,5. However, at these energies, their instantaneous shapes are obscured by long-timescale quantum fluctuations, making direct observation challenging. Here we introduce the collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method, which images the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analysing the collective response of outgoing debris. This technique captures a collision-specific snapshot of the spatial matter distribution within the nuclei, which, through the hydrodynamic expansion, imprints patterns on the particle momentum distribution observed in detectors6,7. We benchmark this method in collisions of ground-state uranium-238 nuclei, known for their elongated, axial-symmetric shape. Our findings show a large deformation with a slight deviation from axial symmetry in the nuclear ground state, aligning broadly with previous low-energy experiments. This approach offers a new method for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances our understanding of the initial conditions in high-energy collisions and addresses the important issue of nuclear structure evolution across energy scales.

 The phosphorylation of synaptic proteins is a significant biochemical reaction that controls the sleep–wake cycle in mammals1–3. Protein phosphorylation in vivo is reversibly regulated by kinases and phosphatases. In this study, we investigate a pair of kinases and phosphatases that reciprocally regulate sleep duration. First, we perform a comprehensive screen of protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family genes by generating 40 gene knockout mouse lines using prenatal and postnatal CRISPR targeting. We identify a regulatory subunit of PKA (Prkar2b), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1; Pppr1r9b) and catalytic and regulatory subunits of calcineurin (also known as PP2B) (Ppp3ca and Ppp3r1) as sleep control genes. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated stimulation of PKA and PP1–calcineurin activities, we show that PKA is a wake-promoting kinase, whereas PP1 and calcineurin function as sleep-promoting phosphatases. The importance of these phosphatases in sleep regulation is supported by the marked changes in sleep duration associated with their increased and decreased activities, ranging from approximately 17.3 h per day (PP1 expression) to 4.3 h per day (postnatal CRISPR targeting of calcineurin). Localization signals to the excitatory post-synapse are necessary for these phosphatases to exert their sleep-promoting effects. Furthermore, the wake-promoting effect of PKA localized to the excitatory post-synapse negated the sleep-promoting effect of PP1–calcineurin. These findings indicate that PKA and PP1–calcineurin have competing functions in sleep regulation at excitatory post-synapses. Calcineurin–PP1 and PKA acting at excitatory post-synapses reciprocally regulate sleep duration in mice, whereby PKA promotes wakefulness and calcineurin–PP1 promote sleep."

 Hyperspectral imaging provides high-dimensional spatial–temporal–spectral information showing intrinsic matter characteristics1–5. Here we report an on-chip computational hyperspectral imaging framework with high spatial and temporal resolution. By integrating different broadband modulation materials on the image sensor chip, the target spectral information is non-uniformly and intrinsically coupled to each pixel with high light throughput. Using intelligent reconstruction algorithms, multi-channel images can be recovered from each frame, realizing real-time hyperspectral imaging. Following this framework, we fabricated a broadband visible–near-infrared (400–1,700 nm) hyperspectral image sensor using photolithography, with an average light throughput of 74.8% and 96 wavelength channels. The demonstrated resolution is 1,024 × 1,024 pixels at 124 fps. We demonstrated its wide applications, including chlorophyll and sugar quantification for intelligent agriculture, blood oxygen and water quality monitoring for human health, textile classification and apple bruise detection for industrial automation, and remote lunar detection for astronomy. The integrated hyperspectral image sensor weighs only tens of grams and can be assembled on various resource-limited platforms or equipped with off-the-shelf optical systems.

 Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous symmetries: translational invariance owing to the appearance of a crystal structure and phase invariance owing to phase locking of single-particle wavefunctions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. Although originally predicted to be present in solid helium1–5, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform to observe supersolids6–10, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms8–12. Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been investigated through, for example, measurements of the phase coherence8–10 and gapless Goldstone modes13, but quantized vortices, a hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here, with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate vortices in dipolar gases14,15 and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline order11,16,17, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation of vortices in the supersolid phase (SSP).

 Memories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning1–6 and are stabilized by post-learning reactivation7–17. Integrating recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unclear. Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed 2 days before, linking fear of the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. Fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the recent aversive memory ensemble is reactivated during the offline period after learning. However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Ensemble co-reactivation occurs more during wake than during sleep. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Collectively, these results demonstrate that offline ensemble co-reactivation is a neural mechanism by which memories are integrated across days. In mice, a strong aversive experience drives offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed 2 days before, linking fear of the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory."

 The fast increase of convergence rate between India and Eurasia around 65 million years ago (Ma)—from approximately 8 cm yr−1 to a peak rate of approximately 18 cm yr−1—remains a complex geological event to explain1–8, given the inherent uncertainty surrounding the tectonic history and the intricate interplay of forces influencing plate speed9–11. Here we use a combination of geochemical analysis and geodynamic modelling to propose that this rapid convergence can be explained by sediment subduction derived from the northern Indian passive margin. Through isotope and trace element analysis, we find an enhanced contribution of terrigenous sediment melt to the mantle source of the Gangdese magmatic rocks around 65 Ma, concurrent with the acceleration of India–Eurasia convergence. Numerical experiments suggest that subduction of sediments more than 1 km thick covering an approximately 1,000-km-wide ocean basin abutting the northern Indian passive margin starting from 65 Ma could have spurred the increased convergence rate and further led to significant crustal extension, consistent with empirical observations. Our study implies that the acceleration of India–Eurasia convergence marks the arrival of passive-margin-derived sediments, constraining the initial India–Eurasia collision to be around 60 Ma. It further suggests that temporary accelerations in subduction rates might be a common feature at the final stage of continental assembly.

 The physical manifestations of memory formation and recall are fundamental questions that remain unresolved1. At the cellular level, ensembles of neurons called engrams are activated by learning events and control memory recall1–5. Astrocytes are found in close proximity to neurons and engage in a range of activities that support neurotransmission and circuit plasticity6–10. Moreover, astrocytes exhibit experience-dependent plasticity11–13, although whether specific ensembles of astrocytes participate in memory recall remains obscure. Here we show that learning events induce c-Fos expression in a subset of hippocampal astrocytes, and that this subsequently regulates the function of the hippocampal circuit in mice. Intersectional labelling of astrocyte ensembles with c-Fos after learning events shows that they are closely affiliated with engram neurons, and reactivation of these astrocyte ensembles stimulates memory recall. At the molecular level, learning-associated astrocyte (LAA) ensembles exhibit elevated expression of nuclear factor I-A, and its selective deletion from this population suppresses memory recall. Taken together, our data identify LAA ensembles as a form of plasticity that is sufficient to provoke memory recall and indicate that astrocytes are an active component of the engram. A study in mice shows that learning induces c-Fos expression in a subset of astrocytes in the hippocampus, and that ensembles of these learning-associated astrocytes are involved in the recall of memories."

The complex interplay of the applied electric field perpendicular to the polarization, current flow parallel to the van der Waals layer and piezoelectric stress results in the formation of interlayer sliding defects and coupled disorder induced by in-plane polarization rotation in this layered material. On reaching a critical limit of the electrically induced disorder, the structure becomes frustrated and locally collapses into an amorphous phase6, and this phenomenon is replicated over a much larger microscopic-length scale through acoustic jerks7,8. Our work uncovers previously unknown multimodal coupling mechanisms of the ferroic order in materials to the externally applied electric field, current and internally generated stress, and can be useful to design new materials and devices for low-power electronic and photonic applications. Energy-efficient, solid-state amorphization of indium selenide nanowires is achieved using direct current, avoiding the melt–quench process."

 Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) presents a major challenge for cancer patients. ecDNA renders tumours treatment resistant by facilitating massive oncogene transcription and rapid genome evolution, contributing to poor patient survival1–7. At present, there are no ecDNA-specific treatments. Here we show that enhancing transcription–replication conflict enables targeted elimination of ecDNA-containing cancers. Stepwise analyses of ecDNA transcription reveal pervasive RNA transcription and associated single-stranded DNA, leading to excessive transcription–replication conflicts and replication stress compared with chromosomal loci. Nucleotide incorporation on ecDNA is markedly slower, and replication stress is significantly higher in ecDNA-containing tumours regardless of cancer type or oncogene cargo. pRPA2-S33, a mediator of DNA damage repair that binds single-stranded DNA, shows elevated localization on ecDNA in a transcription-dependent manner, along with increased DNA double strand breaks, and activation of the S-phase checkpoint kinase, CHK1. Genetic or pharmacological CHK1 inhibition causes extensive and preferential tumour cell death in ecDNA-containing tumours. We advance a highly selective, potent and bioavailable oral CHK1 inhibitor, BBI-2779, that preferentially kills ecDNA-containing tumour cells. In a gastric cancer model containing FGFR2 amplified on ecDNA, BBI-2779 suppresses tumour growth and prevents ecDNA-mediated acquired resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor infigratinib, resulting in potent and sustained tumour regression in mice. Transcription–replication conflict emerges as a target for ecDNA-directed therapy, exploiting a synthetic lethality of excess to treat cancer. Extrachromosomal DNA makes cancerous tumours resistant to treatment, but this research demonstrates that increasing transcription–replication conflict allows for targeted elimination of cancer cells containing extrachromosomal DNA, and thus sustained tumour regression in mice."

 Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major contributor to treatment resistance and poor outcome for patients with cancer1,2. Here we examine the diversity of ecDNA elements across cancer, revealing the associated tissue, genetic and mutational contexts. By analysing data from 14,778 patients with 39 tumour types from the 100,000 Genomes Project, we demonstrate that 17.1% of tumour samples contain ecDNA. We reveal a pattern highly indicative of tissue-context-based selection for ecDNAs, linking their genomic content to their tissue of origin. We show that not only is ecDNA a mechanism for amplification of driver oncogenes, but it also a mechanism that frequently amplifies immunomodulatory and inflammatory genes, such as those that modulate lymphocyte-mediated immunity and immune effector processes. Moreover, ecDNAs carrying immunomodulatory genes are associated with reduced tumour T cell infiltration. We identify ecDNAs bearing only enhancers, promoters and lncRNA elements, suggesting the combinatorial power of interactions between ecDNAs in trans. We also identify intrinsic and environmental mutational processes linked to ecDNA, including those linked to its formation, such as tobacco exposure, and progression, such as homologous recombination repair deficiency. Clinically, ecDNA detection was associated with tumour stage, more prevalent after targeted therapy and cytotoxic treatments, and associated with metastases and shorter overall survival. These results shed light on why ecDNA is a substantial clinical problem that can cooperatively drive tumour growth signals, alter transcriptional landscapes and suppress the immune system.

 Various bacteria are suggested to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) development1–5, including pks+ Escherichia coli, which produces the genotoxin colibactin that induces characteristic mutational signatures in host epithelial cells6. However, it remains unclear how the highly unstable colibactin molecule is able to access host epithelial cells to cause harm. Here, using the microbiota-dependent ZEB2-transgenic mouse model of invasive CRC7, we demonstrate that the oncogenic potential of pks+ E. coli critically depends on bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells, mediated by the type 1 pilus adhesin FimH and the F9 pilus adhesin FmlH. Blocking bacterial adhesion using a pharmacological FimH inhibitor attenuates colibactin-mediated genotoxicity and CRC exacerbation. We also show that allelic switching of FimH strongly influences the genotoxic potential of pks+ E. coli and can induce a genotoxic gain-of-function in the probiotic strain Nissle 1917. Adhesin-mediated epithelial binding subsequently allows the production of the genotoxin colibactin in close proximity to host epithelial cells, which promotes DNA damage and drives CRC development. These findings present promising therapeutic routes for the development of anti-adhesive therapies aimed at mitigating colibactin-induced DNA damage and inhibiting the initiation and progression of CRC, particularly in individuals at risk for developing CRC.

 Chlorinated organic pollutants widely exist in aquatic environments and threaten human health. Catalytic approaches are proposed for their elimination, but sluggish degradation, incomplete dechlorination, and catalyst recovery remain extremely challenging. Here we show efficient dechlorination using ferrous oxide/graphene oxide catalytic membranes with strong nanoconfinement effects. Catalytic membranes are constructed by graphene oxide nanosheets with integrated ultrafine and monodisperse sub-5 nm nanoparticles through simple in-situ growth and filtration assembly. Density function theory simulation reveals that nanoconfinement effects remarkably reduce energy barriers of rate-limiting steps for iron (III)-sulfite complex dissociation to sulfite radicals and dichloroacetic acid degradation to monochloroacetic acid. Combining with nanoconfinement effects of enhancing reactants accessibility to catalysts and increasing catalyst-to-reactant ratios, the membrane achieves ultrafast and complete dechlorination of 180 µg L−1 dichloroacetic acid to chloride, with nearly 100% reduction efficiency within a record-breaking 3.9 ms, accompanied by six to seven orders of magnitude greater first-order rate constant of 51,000 min−1 than current catalysis. Meanwhile, the membranes exhibit quadrupled permeance of 48.6 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 as GO ones, because nanoparticles adjust membrane structure, chemical composition, and interlayer space. Moreover, the membranes show excellent stability over 20 cycles and universality for chlorinated organic pollutants at environmental concentrations. Catalytic removal of chlorinated pollutants is hampered by sluggish degradation, incomplete dechlorination, and poor catalyst recovery. Here, a catalytic membrane with strong nanoconfinement effects is developed for achieving ultrafast, complete, and stable dechlorination of those pollutants."

 While the ruminant gut archaeome regulates the gut microbiota and hydrogen balance, it is also a major producer of the greenhouse gas methane. However, ruminant gut archaeome diversity within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of ruminant animals worldwide remains largely underexplored. Here, we construct a catalogue of 998 unique archaeal genomes recovered from the GITs of ruminants, utilizing 2270 metagenomic samples across 10 different ruminant species. Most of the archaeal genomes (669/998 = 67.03%) belong to Methanobacteriaceae and Methanomethylophilaceae (198/998 = 19.84%). We recover 47/279 previously undescribed archaeal genomes at the strain level with completeness of >80% and contamination of <5%. We also investigate the archaeal gut biogeography across various ruminants and demonstrate that archaeal compositional similarities vary significantly by breed and gut location. The catalogue contains 42,691 protein clusters, and the clustering and methanogenic pathway analysis reveal strain- and host-specific dependencies among ruminant animals. We also find that archaea potentially carry antibiotic and metal resistance genes, mobile genetic elements, virulence factors, quorum sensors, and complex archaeal viromes. Overall, this catalogue is a substantial repository for ruminant archaeal recourses, providing potential for advancing our understanding of archaeal ecology and discovering strategies to regulate methane production in ruminants.

 Most vertebrates, including humans, are highly adept at detecting and encoding biological motion, even when it is portrayed by just a few point lights attached to the head and major joints. However, the function of subcortical regions in biological motion perception has been scarcely explored. Here, we investigate the role of the superior colliculus in local biological motion processing. Using high-field (3 T) and ultra-high-field (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging, we record the neural responses of the superior colliculus to scrambled point-light walkers (with local kinematics retained) in both humans and male macaque monkeys. Results show that the superior colliculus, especially the superficial layers, selectively responds to local biological motion. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling analysis reveals a subcortical-cortical functional pathway that transmits local biological motion signals from the superior colliculus via the middle temporal visual complex to the posterior superior temporal sulcus in the human brain. These findings suggest the existence of a cross-species mechanism in the superior colliculus that facilitates the detection of local biological motion at the early stage of the visual processing stream.

Here, the authors show that this discrepancy is higher than previously found. 
 Massive stars are a major source of chemical elements in the cosmos, ejecting freshly produced nuclei through winds and core-collapse supernova explosions into the interstellar medium. Among the material ejected, long-lived radioisotopes, such as 60Fe (iron) and 26Al (aluminum), offer unique signs of active nucleosynthesis in our galaxy. There is a long-standing discrepancy between the observed 60Fe/26Al ratio by γ-ray telescopes and predictions from supernova models. This discrepancy has been attributed to uncertainties in the nuclear reaction networks producing 60Fe, and one reaction in particular, the neutron-capture on 59Fe. Here we present experimental results that provide a strong constraint on this reaction. We use these results to show that the production of 60Fe in massive stars is higher than previously thought, further increasing the discrepancy between observed and predicted 60Fe/26Al ratios. The persisting discrepancy can therefore not be attributed to nuclear uncertainties, and points to issues in massive-star models. 60Fe and 26Al provide insights about active nucleosynthesis in our galaxy and there is a discrepancy between observed and theoretically predicted ratios.

 Internal variability arising from the inherently chaotic nature of the climate system has amplified or obscured human-caused changes, especially at regional scales in the extratropics, where its contribution to climate variability is the largest. It is virtually certain that this will continue in the near-term. We here focus on the Northern Europe region, whose variability is largely controlled by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) through remote dynamical and thermodynamic processes, and introduce the concept of internal variability storylines (IVS) to explore, understand, and quantify the role of the two combined drivers of internal variability in the modulation of the anthropogenic warming by 2040 in winter. Based on a large ensemble of historical-scenario simulations, we show that the high-impact IVS, characterised by weak AMOC decline and a decadal shift of the NAO toward dominant positive phase, leads faster to warmer-wetter conditions independently of actual and future greenhouse gases emissions. By contrast, amplified AMOC reduction and more recurrent negative NAO can considerably damp both warming and wettening at near-term. In the latter IVS, we provide evidence that winter-severe conditions similar to those in 2010, that had been responsible for widespread socio-economic disruptions, remain almost as likely to occur by 2040. Reframing the uncertain climate outcomes into the physical science space in a conditional form through the prism of IVS makes climate information relevant for accurate risk assessments and adaptation planning."

 The uncertainty regarding the correlation between sea spray aerosol (SSA) formation and sea surface temperature (SST) hinders the accurate estimation of SSA’s impact on global climate. Here, we developed a temperature-controlled plunging SSA simulation tank to investigate the impact of SST on SSA formation from two perspectives: SSA particle size distribution and organic enrichment. Our findings show that SSA particle size decreases with decreasing SST, as exhibited by an increase in SSA within Aitken mode and a decrease in SSA within accumulation and coarse modes. SST can significantly enhance organic enrichment in SSA particles, while the multiplicative increases vary from 2 to 10 times depending on the organic matter species and the SSA particle size. Based on our experimental results, it is predicted that SST reduction may lead to a significantly higher contribution of Aitken modal SSA-derived CCN in cold waters (0 °C) than in warm waters (30 °C). Additionally, we incorporate SST for the first time in estimating the global flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) emitted via SSA, yielding a value ranging from 23.45 to 55.78 Tg C yr−1. Compared to previous works, our study reveals the crucial role of SST in influencing both cloud formation and the atmospheric organic burden of SSA."

 Communities respond to flooding events based upon risk perceptions and available adaptive behaviors (e.g., emigrating, purchasing insurance, constructing levees). Across the United States, sea level rise, intensifying storm-surges, and extreme rainfall may alter human-flood dynamics. Here, we use calibrated Socio-Environmental models of contiguous US coastal census tracts and two shared socio-economic pathways (SSP245 and SSP585). We project that by 2100, total flood insurance claims will increase by +25% to +130% under low (SSP245) and high (SSP585) emissions scenarios, respectively. The increase in flood insurance claims will impact mainly socially vulnerable communities. Further, we project that active NFIP policies will increase from +30% under low emission scenario to +60% under high emission scenario. Our finding also suggests the growing debt of the National Flood Insurance Program under higher emissions. Raising the water elevation threshold for coastal flooding by +1 meter via levees may reduce future surge-related losses by 95% and 40% under low and high emission scenarios and stabilize housing markets. Our future projections of flood insurance claims, policy coverage, and the impact of water elevation serve as credible hypotheses for the evolution of human flood dynamics under climate change. They can inform national flood policy and future research.

 An advance has been made towards a method for forecasting earthquakes several months before they occur. The method relies on changes of groundwater chemistry as earthquake precursors. In a study published in 2014, we showed that changes of groundwater chemistry occurred prior to and were associated with two earthquakes of magnitude 5 and higher, which affected northern Iceland in 2012 and 2013. Here we test the hypothesis that similar or larger earthquakes could have been forecast in the following decade (i.e. 2014–2023) based on our published findings. We found that we could have forecast one of the three greater than magnitude 5 earthquakes that occurred. Noting that changes of groundwater chemistry were oscillatory, we infer expansion and contraction of the groundwater source region caused by coupled crustal dilation and fracture mineralisation associated with the stress build-up before earthquakes. We conclude by proposing how our approach could be implemented elsewhere.

 Remote Oceania was among the last places settled by humans. However, the timing of initial human settlements and the early introduction of horticulture remain debated. We retrieved a sediment core close to Teouma, the oldest cemetery in Remote Oceania that reveals evidence of initial settlement, horticulture practice, and concurrent climatic conditions on the island of Efate, Vanuatu. Sedimentary biomarkers indicating human presence (coprostanol and epicoprostanol), and taro cultivation (palmitone), increase simultaneously, attesting to the early introduction of horticulture by first settlers. The precipitation signal preserved in leaf waxes shows that the initial settlement occurred during a period of increasing wetness—climatic conditions favourable for the establishment of horticulture. The timing of these events is constrained by a high-resolution radiocarbon chronology that places the first unequivocal trace of human activity and horticulture at 2800 years ago.

 In the Mediterranean Sea, the probability that a large earthquake-triggered tsunami will occur in the coming decades is high. Historical tsunami database informs us on their geographical occurrence but their sources, i.e., the faults that slipped during earthquakes and displaced the seafloor to generate tsunamis, are often unknown. Here we identify the submarine rupture of the Amorgos earthquake that on July 9, 1956, triggered the largest mediterranean tsunami in the past two centuries. Using submarines, we explored major normal faults in the epicentral area, and discovered a large surface rupture along the 75-km long Amorgos fault. The 9.8-16.8-m large seafloor offset is compatible with a Mw7.5 event. This finding prompts a reassessment of the largest (≥20 m) tsunami wave origin, previously attributed to earthquake-triggered submarine mass-wasting. It demonstrates that tsunami source can be determined several decades after an event, a key information to better assess future seismic and tsunami hazards.

 With unintentional injuries being the leading mortality cause among children, the comprehensive evaluation of the unintentional injury burden concerning heat exposure remains unknown. Here we quantified the years lived with disability (YLD) due to unintentional child injuries in Guangzhou from 2016–2020 using the injury surveillance data. A Poisson regression model was employed to explore how various magnitudes of heat exposure could increase the injury burden in different children’s subgroups. Our findings suggest a positive link between heat exposure and childhood injuries. The successive heatwave led to a 16.8–23.8% higher risk of childhood injuries. Girls and preschoolers exhibited higher vulnerability to heat. Furthermore, heat exposure increased the road injury burden for preschoolers aged 3–6 years but not for adolescents. Our study links heat exposure to childhood unintentional injuries, providing insights into the demographic features and injury causes. This evidence can be used to inform healthy childhood development.

 To improve the data availability of SAR mode altimeters in coastal zones, we propose a new Adaptive Subwaveform Coastal Retracker (ASCR) and include the empirical coastal retracker ITAS (Improved Threshold Adaptive Subwaveform) and the full-waveform coastal retracker MSCR (Modified SAMOSA+ Coastal Retracker) for comparison in this study. The Sentinel-3A/B altimeter data during the period between January 2020 and December 2022 are reprocessed by these coastal retrackers. The performance of the coastal retrackers, as well as the official Ocean retracker, is intensively assessed over global coastal oceans within 100 km to the coastline. The results show that the coastal retrackers outperform the official Ocean retracker in the 0–20 km distance band, with the data availability increased by up to 7 %, which is statistically significant considering the large amount of coastal sea level data. The ASCR retracker achieves overall better performance than both ITAS and MSCR retrackers. The power spectrum analysis further demonstrates that the noise level within 5 km to the coast is about 35 % higher than that offshore. Moreover, about 6 %–20 % of data loss is observed in the same distance band, which may be because the on-board altimeter fails to record the ocean returns reflected from the nadir sea surface. It is also found that the track-coastline angle is an important factor affecting the data quality of SAR-mode altimeters within the last 10 km to the coast. Finally, the crossover analysis and validation against tide gauges prove that the coastal retrackers can achieve better or at least comparable data quality with official Ocean retracker over global coastal oceans."

 Climate change significantly impacts vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP), yet uncertainties persist in the carbon cycle of tropical terrestrial ecosystems due to incomplete consideration of productivity drivers and lag effects. To address this, we developed a remote sensing-based process model by integrating high-resolution vegetation indices and multi-layer soil hydrological module, to simulate monthly GPP at a 30 m resolution across Hainan Island from 2000 to 2020. The finer GPP can capture more spatial details and show higher accuracy at site scales (R = 0.79 and NRMSE = 14.79 %). Trend analysis and Hurst exponent were used to reveal spatiotemporal dynamics and sustainability of GPP. Meanwhile, nonlinear Granger causality tests quantified both concurrent and lagged correlations between various environmental factors and GPP. The results indicated significant GPP increases across 98.5 % of vegetated areas, with an annual rise of 437.02 g C/m2, and a marked improvement in trends around 2011. Future projections suggest sustained high GPP sustainability (Hurst = 0.53), and reducing “positive-inconsistent” areas in the northeast and southwest is crucial for enhancing local carbon sinks. Furthermore, water availability, temperature, and radiation were primary drivers of GPP changes, affecting 53.55 %, 27.77 %, and 14.43 % of vegetated areas, respectively, with their compounded effects enhancing explanatory power by 35.84 %. Relative humidity dominated water availability impacts on GPP (10.02 % to 79.98 % variation), surpassing precipitation and soil moisture impacts. Lag effects were observed in 68.83 % of vegetated areas, with 1 to 4-month delays in responses to net solar radiation and surface temperature, especially in forest and shrubland ecosystems. This study provides deeper insights into fine-scale GPP simulations and analysis of climate interactions, which are crucial for effective carbon cycle management in tropical ecosystems."

 Modeling incompatible spatial data, i.e., data with different spatial resolutions, is a pervasive challenge in remote sensing data analysis. Typical approaches to addressing this challenge aggregate information to a common coarse resolution, i.e., compatible resolutions, prior to modeling. Such pre-processing aggregation simplifies analysis, but potentially causes information loss and hence compromised inference and predictive performance. To avoid losing potential information provided by finer spatial resolution data and improve predictive performance, we propose a new Bayesian method that constructs a latent spatial process model at the finest spatial resolution. This model is tailored to settings where the outcome variable is measured on a coarser spatial resolution than predictor variables—a configuration seen increasingly when high spatial resolution remotely sensed predictors are used in analysis. A key contribution of this work is an efficient algorithm that enables full Bayesian inference using finer resolution data while optimizing computational and storage costs. The proposed method is applied to a forest damage assessment for the 2018 Adrian storm in Carinthia, Austria, that uses high-resolution laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements and relatively coarse resolution forest inventory measurements. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the proposed approach substantially improves inference for small prediction units."

 Data gaps are a recurring challenge in climate research, hindering effective time series analysis and modeling. This study proposes a novel two-step data imputation framework to address temperature time series with a long continuous gap surrounded by predictor stations with sporadic missingness. The method leverages iterative gap-filling Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for the small sporadic gaps, followed by multivariate techniques like Inverse Distance Weightage (IDW), Kriging, Spatial Regression Test (SRT), Point Estimation method of Biased Sentinel Hospital-based Area Disease Estimation (P-BSHADE), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and MissForest (MF) for the longer gap. Once the sporadic gaps are effectively addressed with SSA, the method carefully applies multivariate techniques to impute the long continuous gap. Prioritizing accuracy, comprehensive cross-validation with class-based statistical indicators are employed to minimize any potential biases introduced by the imputation process. The study shows the effectiveness of SSA in filling small sporadic gaps using an optimal window length (M ≈ 365 days) and eigentriple grouping (ET = 30). Notably, for maximum temperature, P-BSHADE and SVM achieve an impressive accuracy (e.g., Legates's Coefficient of Efficiency (LCE), 0.75∼0.44, Combined Performance Index (CPI), 6.3%∼19.1%) attributed to their ability to capture spatial and/or temporal heterogeneity. While SRT and P-BSHADE offers acceptable performance for minimum temperature (e.g., LCE, 0.51∼0.27, CPI, 0.7%∼23.7%), the study also uncovers a complex interplay between missing data, predictor stations, and autocorrelation affecting imputation accuracy. This suggests that the reduced performance of certain techniques likely stems from the decline in spatial and spatiotemporal autocorrelation between the target station and its predictors. Overall, this study presents a promising framework for handling complex missing data scenarios often encountered in climate time series analysis, paving the way for more robust and reliable analysis and modeling."

 The sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Indian Ocean(IO) has experienced rapid warming over the past 40 years. The reason for this phenomenon is still debated. Our study suggests that the decrease in Arctic sea ice during winter can influence the warming of SST in the Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) through three main pathway including atmospheric circulation, western Pacific SST and Tibet Plateau land. Firstly, the reduction of Arctic sea ice can trigger atmospheric teleconnection wave trains and circulation anomalies from the North Atlantic to the NIO, leading to anticyclone anomaly in the Bay of Bengal(BOB) that increases thermal contribution by radiation warming, as well as cyclonic anomalies in the Arabian Sea(AS) that increases dynamic contribution by warm current transport. Secondly, the reduction of Arctic sea ice can induce a wave train propagating from the Arctic through Eurasia to the western Pacific, resulting in anticyclone anomalies and SST rise in the South China Sea, thus enhancing the dynamic contribution of heat transfer through the Indonesian through flow(ITF). Thirdly,Arctic sea ice can enhances cross-equatorial flow by inducing warm surface temperature of the Tibetan Plateau.These three pathways will still exist until 2045 in future SSP245 emission scenarios.This study establishes a connection between the Arctic and the tropical IO, expanding our understanding of the relationship between these regions."

To study the impact of mitochondrial dynamics on metastasis, we promoted mitochondrial elongation in metastatic breast cancer cells by individual genetic deletion of three key regulators of mitochondrial fission (Drp1, Fis1, Mff) or by pharmacological intervention with leflunomide. Omics analyses revealed that mitochondrial elongation causes substantial alterations in metabolic pathways and processes related to cell adhesion. In vivo, enhanced mitochondrial elongation by loss of mitochondrial fission mediators or treatment with leflunomide notably reduced metastasis formation.

Steane error correction maps the perturbations onto a logical ancilla qubit, which is then measured to check several symmetries simultaneously.

The detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) like perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is critical due to their environmental prevalence and toxicity. Here, we investigate selective interactions between PFAS and four cyclodextrin (CD) variants (α-, β-, γ-, and 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-CD) within an α-hemolysin nanopore. We demonstrate that PFAS molecules can be electrochemically sensed by interacting with a γ-CD in a nanopore. Using HP-γ-CDs with increased steric resistance, we can identify homologs of the perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid and the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid families and detect common PFAS in drinking water at 0.4 to 2 parts per million levels, which are further lowered to 400 parts per trillion by sample preconcentration. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying chemical mechanism of PFAS-CD interactions. These insights pave the way toward nanopore-based in situ detection with promises in environmental protection against PFAS pollution."

To address how erupted steam bursts from underwater volcanoes generate tsunamis, we present the experiments, using pressurized steam injected vertically into a water tank. Results over various eruption conditions identify three eruption regimes, namely, shallow-, intermediate-, and deep-water eruptions, according to the combined effects of water depths, source strengths, and source durations. The transition between shallow and intermediate eruptions is characterized by critical depths maximizing tsunami wave heights, while the transition between intermediate and deep eruptions is characterized by containment depths inhibiting surface disturbances. Water depth and source intensity are the dominant factors controlling maximum wave amplitudes, more so than aspects of jet duration and condensation. These experiments and supporting dimensional analysis improve our understanding of how underwater volcanic eruptions form tsunamis, while also providing a complete dataset for advancing tsunami generation models."

This study used a comprehensive approach combining correlation and information flow to explore relationships among phytoplankton biomass, marine environment, and climate forcing based on global observations over the past multi-decadal period. Correlation and causality between phytoplankton biomass and environmental factors exhibit spatial asymmetry—regions where environmental factors directly drive biomass variations were concentrated in oceanic currents and subtropical circulations. Temperature, light, and mixed layer depth show pronounced influences on global phytoplankton interdecadal variations. Climate forcing over interdecadal timescales directly affects phytoplankton biomass in the equatorial Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Oceans, with more uncertain biomass variability in the equatorial Pacific due to multiple climate events. Our findings revealed that environment and climate changes directly affect phytoplankton interdecadal variability only in specific regions at the oceanic scale."

In particular, cognitive impairments are transdiagnostic, treatment resistant, and associated with poor outcomes. Recent work suggests that thousands of participants may be necessary for the accurate and reliable prediction of cognition, questioning the utility of most patient collection efforts. Here, using a transfer learning framework, we train a model on functional neuroimaging data from the UK Biobank to predict cognitive functioning in three transdiagnostic samples (ns = 101 to 224). We demonstrate prediction performance in all three samples comparable to that reported in larger prediction studies and a boost of up to 116% relative to classical models trained directly in the smaller samples. Critically, the model generalizes across datasets, maintaining performance when trained and tested across independent samples. This work establishes that predictive models derived in large population-level datasets can boost the prediction of cognition across clinical studies."

We show that a train of voltage spikes dynamically modifies the membrane’s ionic permeability in a process involving competitive bicationic transport. This process is shown to be repeatable after a given resting period. Because of a combination of subnanometer pore size and the atomic thinness of the membrane, this system exhibits energy dissipation of 0.1 to 100 aJ per voltage spike, which is several orders of magnitude lower than 0.1 to 10 fJ per spike in the human synapse.

Therefore, relapse from invisible, minimal residual cancer of seemingly disease-free patients call for in vitro models of dormant cells suited for drug discovery. Here, we explore dormancy-inducing 3D engineered matrices, which generate mechanical confinement and induce growth arrest and survival against chemotherapy in cancer cells. We characterized the dormant phenotype of solitary cells by P-ERKlow:P-p38highdormancy signaling ratio, along with Ki67−expression. As underlying mechanism, we identified stiffness-dependent nuclear localization of the four-and-a-half LIM domain 2 (FHL2) protein, leading to p53-independent high p21Cip1/Waf1nuclear expression, validated in murine and human tissue. Suggestive of a resistance-causing role, cells in the dormancy-inducing matrix became sensitive against chemotherapy upon FHL2 down-regulation.

However, our observational analysis shows that, since around 2000, rising surface temperature and the resulting high evaporative demand have contributed more to drought severity (62%) and coverage (66%) over the WUS than precipitation deficit. This increase in evaporative demand during droughts, mostly attributable to anthropogenic warming according to analyses of both observations and climate model simulations, is the main cause of the increased drought severity and coverage. The unprecedented 2020–2022 WUS drought exemplifies this shift in drought drivers, with high evaporative demand accounting for 61% of its severity, compared to 39% from precipitation deficit. Climate model simulations corroborate this shift and project that, under the fossil-fueled development scenario (SSP5-8.5), droughts like the 2020–2022 event will transition from a one-in-more-than-a-thousand-year event in the pre-2022 period to a 1-in-60-year event by the mid-21st century and to a 1-in-6-year event by the late-21st century."

Here, we generalize this approach to incorporate two additional features: an element of randomness or luck that leads to upset wins, and a “depth of competition” variable that measures the complexity of a game or hierarchy. Fitting the resulting model, we estimate depth and luck in a range of games, sports, and social situations. In general, we find that social competition tends to be “deep,” meaning it has a pronounced hierarchy with many distinct levels, but also that there is often a nonzero chance of an upset victory. Competition in sports and games, by contrast, tends to be shallow, and in most cases, there is little evidence of upset wins."
