10.1088/1748-9326/ae36c3,True,Environmental Research Letters,该论文研究了利用卫星数据和机器学习技术来量化哥伦比亚商品驱动的森林砍伐产生的碳排放。虽然主要关注点在于土地利用和碳排放，但文中明确提到了使用地球观测（EO）技术（如卫星数据）来评估土地利用变化和量化碳排放，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术领域有较强的关联性。,"['satellite-derived', 'machine learning', 'aboveground biomass', 'carbon emission factors', 'land-use modeling']",Camilo Zamora;Robert Masolele;Katja Berger;Johannes Reiche;Christopher Martius;Louis Verchot;Zoltan Szantoi;Martin Herold,Refining land-use-specific carbon emission factors for commodity-driven deforestation monitoring in Colombia,"Deforestation remains one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Tropical regions are particularly critical to climate mitigation due to their high carbon density and ongoing conversion to agricultural uses. While earth observation (EO) has become fundamental for assessing land-use change over time and space, key gaps persist in understanding associated carbon emissions (CE) and their distribution across production systems, information required by diverse international and European policy frameworks targeting greenhouse gas reduction and deforestation. To address this, the study integrates satellite-derived aboveground biomass (AGB) with machine learning-based land-use modeling to quantify commodity-specific CE from deforestation in Colombia. Our key findings reveal that pasture expansion for livestock dominates emissions (>67% in the Amazonas and Orinoquía regions, approximately 25% nationally), while cocoa and coffee, despite smaller cultivation areas, exhibit high emission factors (>25% of subregional totals in the Andes, Pacífico, and Caribe). Smallholder croplands contribute up to 16.7% regionally, and oil palm plays a modest role nationally. These results underscore the importance of targeting both extensive pasture systems and high-emission perennial crops in deforestation-free supply chain policies, while considering the diverse regional land-use dynamics. In conclusion, our framework offers spatially explicit, crop-specific emission estimates that address essential gaps in EO-based CE quantification. It provides clear, actionable baselines for monitoring policies aimed at promoting deforestation-free supply chains, such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), across tropical landscapes. Ultimately, this data supports the creation of a comprehensive database of country-specific emission factors, a resource critical for enhancing national carbon inventories, guiding policy decisions related to high-risk deforestation commodities, and ensuring more transparent and traceable zero-deforestation supply chains."

Despite widely available forest monitoring tools that effectively map deforestation, accurate and scalable remote sensing methods to detect selective logging are less advanced. Previous efforts are largely unable to reliably detect the low-intensity selective logging (<10 m3 ha−1) that dominates across much of the Amazon rainforest, the world’s largest remaining stock of tropical timber. Utilising a unique training dataset of high-resolution uninhabited aerial vehicle imagery from logged forests across the Peruvian Amazon, we build random forest models trained to detect selective logging using freely available optical satellite images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat. We find the Sentinel-2 model to be highly accurate (F1 score: 0.88, kappa: 0.85, false detection rate: 6.3%), outperforming the Landsat model (F1 score: 0.77, kappa: 0.74, false detection rate: 21.7%). Both models accurately detected 3- to 20-fold more selective logging activity in our validation data than widely available forest monitoring tools (TMF, GLAD-S2, RADD). We demonstrate novel uses for these logging-detection models in the monitoring of legal timber harvesting inside forest concessions and illegal harvesting of wood inside Protected Areas. These results have the potential to transform our understanding of low-intensity, logging-induced forest degradation at broad scales, demonstrating the clear potential of remote sensing methods to effectively monitor both legal and illegal selective logging in tropical forests."

Among the existing biogeochemical EOVs, data synthesis products—which demonstrate the immense value of data coordination—already exist for carbon-relevant data (e.g. SOCAT, Global Ocean Data Analysis Project), and for methane and nitrous oxide (MEMENTO). The roadmap for building a Global Ocean Oxygen Database and ATlas (GO2DAT) (Grégoire et al (2021 Front. Mar. Sci.1638)) provides the theoretical basis to increase the interoperability of ocean oxygen data sets, without creating yet another separate repository. The goal is now to advance from the idea of GO2DAT to its implementation, building a sustainable, interoperable, and inclusive digital ecosystem for all stakeholders who may use ocean oxygen data. Successful implementation will require (I) the provision of guidance on data acquisition/ocean oxygen measurements, (II) recommended practices for ocean oxygen data management, including metadata requirements, uncertainty and data quality control attribution, (III) development of the ocean oxygen data platform including data flow and application of the recommended practices introduced in I and II, as well as its deep integration with cross-domain data federations such as the Ocean Data and Information System. This document provides an outline of GO2DAT’s objective and progress since 2021 and contributes to addressing these three requirements, synthesizing a series of global consultations on recommended practices for marine dissolved oxygen measurements, a working definition of ocean oxygen metadata, proposed data quality control levels and flags, a described novel mechanism for uncertainty attribution to allow the determination of data suitability for different scientific applications, and it concludes with an illustration of the data flow for implementation."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae3d4d,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注的是基于自然的解决方案（NbS）在减缓沿海水气象灾害方面的有效性，虽然涉及沿海环境，但并未涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析或气溶胶反演等。,"['coastal hydrometeorological hazards', 'nature-based solutions', ' NbS']",Mohammed Sarfaraz Gani Adnan;Abiy S Kebede;Kwasi Appeaning Addo;Ashraf Dewan;Tuhin Ghosh;Christopher J White;Philip J Ward,Towards nature-positive engineering: nature-based solutions in attenuating coastal hydrometeorological hazards,"Coastal and deltaic regions are highly vulnerable to hydrometeorological hazards such as storms, flooding, and extreme temperatures—risks that are intensifying under climate change. While hard engineering structures (e.g. levees, seawalls) remain widely used, they can be costly, ecologically disruptive, and may exacerbate hazard complexity. Nature-based solutions (NbS), including mangroves, salt marshes, and other coastal ecosystems, offer sustainable and often cost-effective alternatives or complementarities that can mitigate hazards while delivering ecological and societal co-benefits. However, their effectiveness is difficult to assess due to diverse methodological approaches, site-specific coastal dynamics, and inconsistent reporting indicators. This study synthesises the scientific evidence base on the effectiveness of NbS in reducing hydrometeorological hazards in coastal and deltaic environments and evaluates the robustness of methods used to assess their performance. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 383 peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 2008 and 2024 was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocols and the PICO framework. Using an evaluation approach adapted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, each study was assessed for evidence robustness, level of agreement, and overall confidence. The meta-analysis provides quantitative estimates of NbS effectiveness and highlights substantial uncertainties arising from ecological variability, methodological inconsistencies, and heterogeneity in hazard indicators (e.g. wave height, flow velocity, water level, temperature) and measurement units. Findings show that NbS effectiveness is highly context dependent and influenced by site characteristics, ecological dimensions, system configuration, and hazard intensity. The study emphasises the need for standardised, hazard-specific indicators and greater use of integrated methodological approaches to strengthen the reliability and comparability of future assessments. It also identifies opportunities for advancing hybrid or nature-positive engineering solutions that combine NbS with conventional infrastructure to enhance coastal resilience."

The conventional recharge/discharge theory effectively explains MLa Niñas preceded by strong El Niño events (SE-MLa Niñas), but fails to account for MLa Niñas occurring without preceding strong El Niño influences (NSE-MLa Niñas). Here we show, through integrated observational analyses and climate model simulations, that the Pacific meridional mode (PMM) acts as a key driver for the initiation and maintenance of NSE-MLa Niñas. Unlike SE-MLa Niñas, which rely on El Niño-induced oceanic memory, NSE-MLa Niñas are sustained by the PMM-related subtropical air–sea coupling processes, notably through an intensified wind–evaporation–sea surface temperature feedback mechanism as quantitatively diagnosed in this study. Future projections indicate that under global warming scenarios, the frequency of NSE-MLa Niñas may increase more relative to SE-MLa Niñas, possibly due to the enhanced PMM variability. These findings deepen our understanding of ENSO dynamics by uncovering subtropical processes as critical drivers of persistent La Niña conditions, with profound implications for advancing ENSO prediction systems."

Among the methods used to control nonpoint-source pollution, small water bodies such as ditches and ponds have received increasing attention due to their widespread distribution and low cost. However, most previous studies have focused on specific regions, and the key factors regulating phosphorus retention and their generalizable patterns remain unclear. Additionally, research on the synthesis of global water-body nutrient retention is largely limited to studies from North America and Europe. Here, we compiled a phosphorus retention dataset for small water bodies across China that incorporates research published in Chinese. Using multiple statistical analyses to assess the hydrological processes and external influencing factors on phosphorus removal rate and efficiency, our results show that the median total phosphorus removal rate in ditches and ponds across China was 33.7%. Among all hydrological and external influencing factors, hydraulic retention time (HRT) served as a pivotal parameter in the modulation of phosphorus removal efficiency. Extending HRT is an effective method to enhance phosphorus retention in water bodies, although it also demonstrates diminishing marginal returns. By regulating the HRT of small water bodies, a win–win situation with both pollutant reduction and agricultural production may be achieved, thereby enhancing the resilience of agricultural ecosystems to climate change. This study provides a scientific basis and technical support for achieving the dual goals of sustainable agricultural development and environmental improvement in developing countries—particularly in rice-producing regions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae3e01,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要研究干旱地区地下水补给的机制，虽然涉及水文过程，但与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析、气溶胶反演）没有直接关联。,"['groundwater', 'recharge', 'drylands', 'vadose zone', 'evapotranspiration']",Gabriel C Rau;José Bastías Espejo;R Ian Acworth;Martin S Andersen;Dylan J Irvine;Tony Bernardi;Mark O Cuthbert,Temporally clustered streamflow events control focused groundwater recharge in drylands,"Groundwater (GW) is the primary freshwater resource in many of the world’s drylands, sustaining millions of people and supporting agriculture and ecosystems where surface water is scarce or unreliable. Recharge in these regions is highly episodic and occurs mainly through ephemeral streams (i.e. focused recharge), yet the mechanisms that determine whether surface flows contribute to aquifer replenishment remain poorly constrained. A common assumption is that large floods dominate recharge, but evidence from long-term monitoring is limited and inconclusive. We combine a unique hydrogeological monitoring dataset from the arid zone (Fowlers Gap in western New South Wales, Australia) with numerical modelling of vadose zone processes to assess the controls on focused GW recharge. Our results show that even extreme floods that overtopped piezometers did not produce measurable recharge at the water table. In contrast, significant recharge occurred only during a temporal cluster of moderate flow events in 2022. Numerical simulations confirm that temporal flow clustering produces longer periods of ephemeral streamflow, which progressively wet the vadose zone, overcome evapotranspiration (ET)-driven moisture deficits, and increase relative hydraulic conductivity, enabling percolation to the water table. Isolated floods, by contrast, largely saturate only shallow sediments and water is subsequently lost to ET. By explicitly incorporating ET, our modelling provides a more realistic representation of dryland recharge dynamics and highlights the roles of antecedent conditions and vadose zone properties. These findings demonstrate that recharge is not governed by rainfall totals or intensity alone, but critically depends on the timing and sequence of storm events. The implications for climate change assessments and water management are substantial, as projected shifts toward more intense but less frequent rainfall may reduce opportunities for clustering and thereby limit GW replenishment. Process-based modelling and event-scale analyses are therefore essential for reliable recharge projections and sustainable GW management in drylands."

Palmer;Michael Boy,Modelling the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on CCN concentrations over a rural boreal forest environment,"Cloud condensation nuclei are necessary to form clouds, and their size distribution affects cloud properties and therefore Earth’s energy budget. This study modelled the origins of cloud condensation nuclei at SMEAR II, Hyytiälä, Finland, and found that primary emissions and new particle formation separately contribute to more than half of the condensation nuclei, but they suppress each other, leading to current concentrations. Largest condensation nuclei originated mostly from emissions. 
 The radiative properties of clouds depend partially on the cloud droplet number concentration, which is determined by the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) when the clouds are formed. In turn, CCN concentrations are determined by the atmospheric particle size distribution and their chemical composition. We use a novel Lagrangian modelling framework to examine the origins and history of gas and aerosol components observed at the boreal forest measurement site SMEAR II, and their potential to act as CCN. This framework combines: (a) global emission datasets, (b) backward trajectories from the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART) airmass dispersion model, (c) a detailed description of atmospheric chemistry and aerosol dynamics from the Model to Simulate the Concentration of Organic Vapours, Sulphuric Acid and Aerosol Particles (SOSAA). We apply this SOSAA-FP (FP standing for FLEXPART) framework to simulate a period from March to October 2018 with 1 h time resolution, focusing on the concentrations of CCN between 0.1 % and 1.2 % maximum supersaturation as calculated by the κ-Köhler theory (with respective dry particle diameter of activation ca. 175–35 nm). We find that the model PM1 fraction of primary particles, sulfates and secondary organic aerosol correlate well with the observed organic aerosol and sulfate trends and explain most of the observed organic aerosol and sulfate PM1 mass. Our results show that primary particle emissions play a considerable role in CCN concentrations even at a rural site such as SMEAR II. Changes in atmospheric cluster formation rates had a relatively weak impact on the CCN concentrations in the sensitivity runs. Enhanced cluster formation increased (decreased) the CCN concentrations for the highest (lowest) maximum supersaturation. Without any cluster formation our modelled median CCN concentrations changed by −48 % and +23 % for supersaturations of 1.2 % and 0.1 %, respectively, whereas omitting primary particle emissions had a decreasing effect in all calculated CCN supersaturation classes (−82 % and −33 % decrease in median CCN of 1.2 % and 0.1 % supersaturation, respectively). While the enhancing effect of cluster formation to high supersaturation (i.e., small diameter) CCN concentrations is unsurprising, the weak sensitivity to cluster formation rates and the decreasing effect to lowest supersaturation CCN was unexpected, as was the strong influence of anthropogenic primary emissions. The Lagrangian model framework showed its power, as it was possible to trace down the causes behind the unexpected outcomes by comparing how the particle population evolved along the trajectories in different sensitivity tests."

Our results generate non-negative emission datasets using objective selection and filtering methods. The results include lower minimum emission thresholds for all power grids and fewer false positives. The new method provides more robust emission quantification in the face of data uncertainty, going beyond traditional plume identification and background subtraction. 
 We propose a novel method for computing the effects of TROPOMI observational uncertainties on emissions calculation arising from the nonlinearity of the gradient terms and non-biased filtering in space and time. Application using TROPOMI XCH4 data in clean areas of Western China with long-term WMO background observations quantifies a minimum detectable emission threshold of 0.3 µgm-2s-1, lower than existing community thresholds using TROPOMI. By combining threshold-based and stochastic approaches that incorporates pixel-by-pixel and day-by-day XCH4 uncertainties, we identify and filter physically unrealistic emission values in both space and time. The resulting emissions reveal both missing sources and emission bias caused by the nonlinearity of the gradient term. Validation was performed by applying the method to the Permian Basin, where comparisons with airborne observations demonstrate the method's ability to align with independent datasets. The importance and implications of our results are related to this being a new methodology for methane emissions estimate from TROPOMI which enables precise identification of emission sources and improved handling of observational noise, offering a more accurate framework for methane emission monitoring across diverse regions using existing satellite platforms. Our results yield a non-negative emissions dataset using an objective selection and filtration method, which includes a lower minimum emissions threshold on all grids and reduction of false positives. Finally, the new approach can be adopted to other satellite platforms to provide a more robust and reliable quantification of emissions under data uncertainty that moves beyond traditional plume identification and background subtraction."

Unmeasured oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were the most effective compensating factor for the discrepancies in both P(O3)net and OFS. OFS exhibiting a diurnal shift dominated by the morning regime; prioritizing VOCs while co-controlling NOx is the most effective strategy for O3 pollution control in the PRD region. 
 Ground-level ozone (O3) pollution has recently become of increasing concern in China. Studies have shown that conventional models often fail to predict accurately the net O3 production rate (P(O3)net) due to the absence of certain mechanisms, particularly the kinetics from missing reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) species, and hence affects the reliability of evaluation for O3 formation sensitivity (OFS). Therefore, we conducted a field observation of P(O3)net and OFS using a P(O3)net (NPOPR) detection system based on a dual-channel reaction chamber technique at the Guangdong Atmospheric Supersite of China in Heshan, Pearl River Delta (PRD) in autumn of 2023. The in-situ monitoring data were then compared with results from a zero-dimensional model incorporating the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.3.1). We tested the model performance by incorporating parameterization for 4 processes including HO2 uptake by ambient aerosols, dry deposition, N2O5 uptake, and ClNO2 photolysis, and found that the discrepancies between the modelled P(O3)net (P(O3)net_Mod) and measured data (P(O3)net_Mea) did not change evidently, the maximum daily P(O3)net differed by ∼ 44.8 %. Meanwhile, we found that the agreement of OFS assessment results between the direct measurements and the modelling study was lower in the P(O3)net rising phase (08:00–09:00 LT, 63.6 %) than in the P(O3)net stable phase (10:00–12:00 LT, 72.7 %) and P(O3)net declining phase (13:00–17:00 LT, 72.7 %). The results in this study reflected that unmeasured oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were the most effective compensating factor for the discrepancies between observed and computed P(O3)net and OFS, hinting clearly at the importance of quantitative understanding the total reactivity of VOCs in O3 chemistry."

Westervelt;Jayanarayanan Kuttippurath,Sensitivity of photochemical surface ozone formation regimes to emissions and meteorology in India,"This study examines the inverse effect of aerosol surface area and particulate matter (PM) reduction on air quality and atmospheric chemistry, particularly on surface ozone levels. Aerosols act as surfaces for the uptake of hydroxyl radicals (HO2), which are essential for controlling ozone formation. Reducing aerosols and PM may enhance surface ozone formation, thus worsening air quality. However, further efforts to decrease NOx emissions could mitigate this rise in surface ozone levels. 
 Atmospheric aerosols significantly contribute to air pollution and influence atmospheric chemistry, impacting air quality and public health.  Decrease in aerosols can hinder the radical uptake sink of HO2, and thus increase NOx and OH, and subsequently increase ozone levels. This study investigates the seasonal variations of PM10 and aerosol surface area and their effect on surface ozone levels in India, using the GEOS-Chem Chemical Transport Model for the years 2018 and 2022, two years with high and low simulated PM10 concentrations, respectively. The results reveal substantial seasonal variations in PM10 and aerosol surface area. In winter (DJF), higher PM10 and aerosol surface area in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and western Central India (CI) result from biomass burning and industrial activity, while coastal regions show lower aerosol surface area.  A decrease in aerosol surface area is seen during the pre-monsoon (March–April–May; MAM) and monsoon (June–July–August–Septmember; JJAS), followed by an increase in the post-monsoon (ON) season. As a result, aerosol-induced HO2 uptake during winter and post-monsoon suppress surface ozone by approximately 5–10 µg m−3 in 2022 when compared to that of 2018. In contrast, during monsoon in 2022, the decrease in aerosol surface area caused an ozone increase of 5–7.5 µg m−3 when compared to that of 2018. On average, this increase in surface ozone due to the decrease in aerosols can be mitigated by reducing anthropogenic NOx emissions by about 25 %–50 %. Thus, we recommend integrated strategies addressing aerosols, precursor emissions and regional meteorology to combat ozone pollution."

Based on mountaintop observations in the Yangtze River Delta, we show that under polluted conditions, NPF at the boundary-layer top is enhanced and accelerates its conversion to CCN. Ammonia plays a key role, and a newly defined ""Time Window"" metric highlights the importance of oxidation-driven growth and regional transport in this process. 
 To what extent the new particle formation (NPF) contributed to the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) remained unclear, especially at the boundary layer top (BLT) in polluted atmosphere. Based on measurements at a mountain-top background site in southeastern China during spring 2024, this study systematically investigates the nucleation mechanism and subsequent growth dynamics of NPF events under contrasting air masses, and quantifies their role as a source of CCN. Eight NPF events were observed, and three of them occurred in the polluted conditions (NPF-P) which associated with regional transportation while the rest five events appeared in the clean conditions (NPF-C). The average formation rate (J2.5: 2.4 cm-3s-1 vs. 0.7 cm-3s-1) and growth rate (GR: 6.8 nm h−1 vs. 5.5 nm h−1) were significantly higher in NPF-P events than in NPF-C events, alongside elevated concentrations of sulfuric acid and ammonia. The correlation between log J3 and [H2SO4], as well as theoretical simulations with the MALTE_BOX model, indicates that the enhanced nucleation in polluted conditions can be attributed to the participation of ammonia in stabilizing sulfuric acid-based clusters. In addition, much higher CCN enhancement factor was observed in NPF-P (EFCCN: 1.6 vs. 0.7 in NPF-C) due to the regional transported of anthropogenic pollutants from the urban cluster regions and their secondary transformation under enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity. Furthermore, the duration of NPF-to-CCN conversion was quantified using a “Time Window (τ)”, revealing that polluted conditions accelerated the conversion by 17.0 % (τ = 16.4 h vs. 19.8 h). Nitrate played an important role in maintaining a rapid particle growth rate, thereby shortening τ and enhancing CCN production from NPF – a process that can ultimately influence cloud microphysical properties by increasing the potential cloud droplet number concentration. These findings reveal that polluted air masses enhance both the efficiency and speed of CCN production at the BLT through elevated atmospheric oxidation capacity."

In passive remote sensing observations of greenhouse gases, it creates false patterns in gas concentration maps. In this work, the impact of stray light in the full processing chain from measured spectra, retrieved concentration maps, to emission rate estimates using measured and simulated data is analysed for MAMAP2D-Light. Additionally, a hardware improvement mitigates stray light for onward missions. 
 MAMAP2D-Light is an airborne passive remote sensing imaging push-broom spectrometer developed at the Institute for Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen to determine atmospheric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) column anomalies in the 1.6 µm-band to quantify point-source emissions. In its initial version, as flown in 2022 in Canada, a significant stray light level of 5.6 % of the measured signal has been observed post-campaign, causing apparent error patterns in the retrieved CO2 and CH4 column anomalies. Measurement data collected during an airborne campaign in 2022 in Canada offer the unique opportunity to investigate the end-to-end impact of stray light and its correction on the retrieved CO2 and CH4 column anomalies, as well as the derived emission rates. We successfully developed and applied a stray light correction to the instrument and investigated its impact on the CH4/CO2 proxy method, the CH4 column, and derived point-source emissions. In nearly all cases, applying the CH4/CO2 proxy method reduced the stray-light-related column errors below the CH4 column noise. The derived emission rates for the proxy-retrieval with and without stray light corrected spectra are comparable, proving the ability of the CH4/CO2 proxy method to correct stray-light-related artifacts. In this paper, we additionally investigate the impact on the CH4 total column retrieval for a high contrast scene condition under which the correction by applying the proxy method is no longer sufficient. Following the initial campaign in 2022, the post-campaign stray light characterization and analysis revealed that a significant fraction of stray light was attributed to reflective surfaces in the object plane of the spectrometer. Based on these findings, the total stray light was reduced by ∼ 63 % by implementing a hardware modification from 2023 onward."

These maps reveal important patterns in soil health, such as a significant global loss of soil carbon in the past 25 years. Our results help track land degradation and support better land restoration efforts. This work provides a new global tool for understanding and protecting soil, a key resource for food, water, and climate. 
 There is increasing interest in global dynamic soil information with changes in soil properties mapped over time and at high spatial resolution. Thanks to long-term, multi-temporal, and fine- and medium-resolution satellite missions such as Landsat, MODIS, Copernicus Sentinel and similar, it is possible to produce globally consistent predictions of key soil variables that match other 10–30 m spatial resolution global data sets. This paper describes data preparation, modeling, and production of OpenLandMap-soildb: global dynamic predictions of soil organic carbon content, soil organic carbon density, bulk density, soil pH in H2O, soil texture fractions (clay, sand and silt) and USDA subgroup soil types (USDA soil taxonomy subgroups) at 30 m spatial resolution based on spatiotemporal Machine Learning (Quantile Regression Random Forest with output predictions showing the mean plus the 68 % probability lower and upper prediction intervals). To train the models, a large compilation of soil samples imported from legacy soil projects was used: 216 000 soil samples with soil carbon density (kg m−3), 408 000 soil samples with soil carbon content (g kg−1), 272 000 soil samples with soil pH in H2O, 363 000 soil samples with clay, silt and sand content (%) and 134 000 samples with bulk density oven dry (t m−3). Soil carbon and soil pH were mapped with 5-year time-intervals; soil texture fractions, bulk density, and soil types were mapped for recent years only. The cross-validation results indicate Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 17.7 (kg m−3; 0.486 in log-scale) and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.88 for SOC density, RMSE of 51.3 (g kg−1; 0.574 in log-scale) and CCC of 0.87 for SOC content, RMSE of 0.15 (t m−3) and CCC of 0.92 for bulk density of fine-earth, RMSE of 0.51 and CCC of 0.91 for soil pH, RMSE of 8.4 % and CCC of 0.87 for soil clay content, and RMSE of 12.6 % and CCC of 0.84 for soil sand content respectively. The most important variables for predicting soil organic carbon density (kg m−3) were: soil depth, Landsat-based uncalibrated Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and CHELSA bioclimatic indices. The global distribution of soil pH can be primarily explained by the CHELSA Aridity Index (long-term), annual precipitation, and salinity grade. The global stocks for 2020–2022+ period for 0–30 cm depth interval are estimated at 461 Pg (Peta grams); the results further indicate that, in the last 25 years, the world has lost at least 11 Pg of SOC in the top soil. Suggestions are made on how to set up global permanent monitoring stations to accurately track land degradation and enable land restoration projects.

Each contrail is segmented, tracked, and, where possible, attributed to individual flights. A baseline model based on panoptic segmentation is also provided to demonstrate instance-level detection. This dataset enables empirical analysis of contrail lifecycle and supports the validation and calibration of physical models. 
 Aviation’s climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can alter Earth’s radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets do not explore all aspects of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set (Jarry et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16419651) of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24 228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments."

Here, we present SAL-GPP, a process-based model that incorporates coastal-specific modules to capture the effects of salinity and temperature stress on photosynthesis, as well as light-use efficiency across salinity gradients in diverse CSM plant species. Model validation showed strong agreement with observations, with R2 of 0.82 and model efficiencies of 0.82 and 0.74 for daily and seasonal GPP, respectively. Driven with global inputs, SAL-GPP produced high-resolution global simulations, yielding a mean annual GPP of 66.89 ± 11.68 TgC yr–1 (2011–2020), with 64% concentrated in key hotspots across the southeastern United States, western Europe, southeastern China, and Australia. From 2011 to 2016, global CSM GPP increased by 1.56 TgC yr–1, then declined, rebounded after 2018, and peaked at 71.45 ± 12.02 TgC yr–1 in 2020. Model evaluation showed that SAL-GPP outperformed existing remote sensing-based GPP products and TBMs at both site and grid levels. By explicitly incorporating coastal ecosystem dynamics, SAL-GPP supports global BC accounting and climate mitigation strategies aligned with nature-based solutions for carbon neutrality."

One key challenge in method development lies in balancing sensitivity, speed, and portability. To address it, a one-step assay targeting the carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM was developed based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with CRISPR/Cas12a. A sensitivity optimization paradigm─MOSAIC (multistrategy optimized sensitive assay via integrated CRISPR/Cas12a)─was proposed, incorporating component optimization, suboptimal-PAM-mediated CRISPR inhibition, and glycerol-assisted phase separation. The glycerol-assisted strategy exhibited the largest enhancement, followed by the suboptimal-PAM strategy and component optimization. When combined, these strategies demonstrated a synergistic effect, yielding greater improvement (10 000-fold) than a single strategy alone. MOSAIC reached a limit of detection (LOD) of 260 copies/μL, comparable to that of qPCR, and enabled faster quantification of blaNDM at 37 °C within 1 h on a standard plate reader. It achieved 100% diagnostic sensitivity and 95.45% specificity in clinical isolates, and 77.41–99.73% accuracy in environmental matrix-spiked samples, comparable to that of qPCR. It provides a technological foundation for on-site detection of blaNDM and offers an optimization paradigm and new insights for the development of one-step RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assays targeting various genes."

Apte,Methodological Design Choices Can Affect Air Pollution Exposure Disparity Estimates: A Case Study on California’s Agricultural Sector,"People of color in the United States are disproportionately and unfairly exposed to air pollution. Equity-oriented scientific evaluations quantifying these disparities often use population-average exposure metrics to capture the overall inequality within a system. Utilizing these metrics involves choices about the exposure input for assessing disparity, the study geography, and the reference population, which are critical to understanding disparities and effectively designing interventions. Here, we use a case study of exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from California’s agricultural sector to dissect the implications of these decisions. Using a reduced-complexity model and emissions of PM2.5 and precursors, we compare estimates of racial and ethnic disparities in exposure resulting from different combinations of these methodological choices. The full population distributions highlight differences between disparities at the extremes (e.g., 90th percentile) and at the mean. Additionally, the selection of study geography and reference population can influence the magnitude and relative ordering of exposure disparities. Thus, methodological choices can lead to different conclusions for the same concentration and population surfaces; this can impact not only the findings of an individual study but also have implications for mitigation strategies. We conclude with recommendations for best practices for making, justifying, and communicating these methodological decisions."

We propose a novel equilibrium analysis framework to assess the feasibility of implementing ETS in China’s central heating sector. The results demonstrate that implementing an emission trading scheme (ETS) within the central heating sector can accelerate decarbonization process by shifting the focus of the current Clean Heating Campaign from gas boilers to industrial surplus heat and geothermal energy, aligning with China’s goal of reaching 25% nonfossil energy by 2030. It can provide a more cost-effective and sustainable decarbonization pathway in which a 1% annual reduction in carbon quotas leads to emissions peak at 2033, as well as it is expected to generate significant co-benefits by reducing heating-related air pollution. A well-designed subsidy reallocation and phase-out strategy can enable the ETS to drive decarbonization and alleviate fiscal pressures. This combination of ETS and subsidies ensures a smooth transition to low-carbon heating in the short term and is sustainable in the long run through endogenous technological advancement and market self-regulation."

While the Global Value Chains (GVCs) division enhances productive efficiency, its impact on carbon productivity remains elusive. Here we integrated the GVCs theory with the Environmental Expanded Input-output model to investigate the highly globalized automotive manufacturing industry. We found that CO2 emissions intensity, the inverse of carbon productivity, fluctuated between 0.37 and 0.47 kg/USD in automotive manufacturing GVCs during 2001–2021. Notably, developing economies nearly doubled their CO2 emissions intensity during this period, whereas developed economies almost halved theirs. The global distribution of CO2 emissions and value added is becoming increasingly unequal in industrial production and service segments. Lower production levels and energy efficiency in developing economies, coupled with their upstream roles in GVCs (raw materials and industrial parts suppliers), exacerbate these disparities. Our findings indicate that merely global labor division is insufficient to create low-carbon automotive manufacturing GVCs. Formulating emission reduction targets that consider the diverse roles of economies within GVCs, and supporting developing economies in boosting energy productivity, labor value added efficiency, and skill can help narrow the distribution gaps and enhance the carbon productivity of the entire automotive manufacturing GVCs."

The deficiency of reactive oxygen species fundamentally restricts the low-temperature catalytic toluene combustion in transition-metal oxide catalysts. Herein, we report a strategy for intelligently designing active Cu+–Ov–Ti ensembles by coupling isolated Cu with adjacent oxygen vacancy, which can synergistically activate chemisorbed O2 into reactive superoxide species (O2–). The defective Cu/TiO2–x catalyst exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for toluene oxidation, achieving a T90 of 225 °C, significantly 100 °C lower than that of the pristine Cu/TiO2 catalyst. The low coordination geometry and electron transfer within Cu+–Ov–Ti ensembles synergistically activated O2 to form the Cu–(O–O)ad–Ti bridged superoxide O2– intermediate with an elongated O═O bond. In addition, the distinctive Cu–(O–O)ad–Ti bridging structure with localized electrons facilitated the chemisorbed O2 dissociation into electrophilic monatomic O– species, which subsequently nucleophilically attack the methyl C–H of toluene. These benzyl alcohol-derived Ph–CH2–O– intermediates can be readily and flexibly converted into reactive benzaldehyde and benzoic acid species, which were available for subsequent aromatic ring-opening reactions. This study not only advances mechanistic insights into the Cu+–Ov–Ti ensembles and electrophilic O– species in toluene catalytic oxidation but also establishes a design Cu+–Ov–Ti principle for engineering efficient VOC elimination catalysts."

Constructed wetlands have emerged as viable alternatives to advanced wastewater treatment processes for effluent polishing due to their low cost and ancillary benefits. Starting in the late 1980s, experiences gained from several decades of operating wetlands in small communities increased confidence that these nature-based treatment systems could be effective and reliable. As a result, investments were made in larger constructed wetlands, with surface areas greater than a million square meters (1 Mm2) and flows often exceeding 1 m3 s–1, on effluent-dominated rivers and as part of potable water reuse projects. More recently, new wetland designs have improved the constructed wetland system performance by taking advantage of sunlight-mediated processes in the water column and microbial processes on subsurface porous media. Research that provides additional insight into contaminant removal mechanisms, demonstrates long-term viability, and further improves treatment performance could expand the application of constructed wetlands to other difficult-to-solve water quality challenges, including the treatment of municipal water reuse concentrate and the mitigation of nonpoint source pollution."

We evaluated the accuracy of seven longitudinal PM2.5 concentration data sets from 2002 to 2014 and conducted equity and health impact analysis using each. Specifically, we estimated population exposure improvements over time, exposure disparities for vulnerable subpopulations, and PM2.5-attributable mortality across several combinations of inputs. Nationally, reductions in population exposure to PM2.5 were consistently observed in all models between 2002 and 2014 in Canada, with larger reductions among subpopulations of visible minority status, suggesting that PM2.5 exposure and absolute exposure disparities improved over this period. Agreement between PM2.5 models is strongest for PM2.5-attributable mortality, whereas exposure time trends and contrasts between subpopulations differ more widely. Nationally, estimated PM2.5-attributable mortality ranged from 7,400 to 26,000 deaths in 2014 across combinations of seven PM2.5 models, four Canadian risk estimates, and counterfactuals of 0 and 2.5 μg/m3. PM2.5-attributable death estimates are sensitive to inputs of mortality risks, counterfactuals, and PM2.5 models.

Here we demonstrate that, since the 2000s, Central American precipitation anomalies in spring have become more likely to persist into summer‐a shift that single‐season analyses overlook. This lengthened persistence arises from a regime change in which multi‐month “persistent events” now dominate over the previously common “transitional events.” Persistent events are anchored by coupling between warm tropical Atlantic (TA) and cold tropical Central‐Eastern Pacific (TCEP) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies that sustains cyclonic circulation, whereas transitional events rely on rapid TCEP SST reversals that disrupt rainfall anomalies. Strengthened Atlantic influences on Pacific climate since 2000 have prolonged Pacific SST persistence, boosting persistent‐event frequency and extending springtime rainfall anomalies into summer. This cross‐seasonal persistence heightens risks to water, food and biodiversity in Central America."

However, the Aqua MODIS‐retrieved Nd exhibits an unexpected and substantial increase over the near‐global oceans after 2022, contradicting the expected decline from continued emission reduction efforts. Here we demonstrate that this surge is not physical but largely an artifact of sensor orbital drift, which alters viewing geometry and solar illumination. By leveraging concurrent Suomi‐NPP VIIRS observations unaffected by drift, we developed an empirical correction that removes this artificial signal and quantified global mean Nd artificial biases of +2.4 cm−3 in 2023 and +5.0 cm−3 in 2024. These biases substantially distort the Nd trends, reversing the previously decreasing global Nd trend into an apparent strong rise after 2022.

Using satellite data and a coupled ocean–sea ice model, we examined how freshwater from the Mackenzie River influences fall sea ice formation in the Beaufort Sea. An “ice bridge” between the coast and offshore ice edge consistently forms over the river's freshwater plume, with its location and extent varying interannually with freshwater distribution. Regions influenced by the plume experienced sea ice onset an average of 3 weeks earlier than adjacent, saltier waters.

Using a moisture‐tracking model, we quantify the moisture sources of APENC's precipitation and its trends, and reveal mechanisms linking anomalous upwind moisture transport to droughts. Terrestrial moisture sources (67.60%) dominate APENC's precipitation. Over 2000–2023, moisture sources from high‐latitude Eurasia and the Tibetan Plateau have increased, whereas those from oceanic sources have decreased significantly. During recent drought events, reductions in moisture inflow from key terrestrial source regions, especially East Asia and the South Asia–Indian Ocean region, primarily triggered rainfall deficits in the APENC. The combination of weakened moisture inflows and reduced local humidity amplified moisture scarcity, sustaining drought severity. These findings highlight the coupled roles of remote transport and land–atmosphere feedbacks in APENC droughts, providing new evidence for understanding semi‐arid hydroclimate risks."

We show that magnetic responses to sub‐GPa stresses can be precisely calibrated, enabling three‐dimensional paleostress reconstructions in rocks—even stresses of just a few MPa can fully reset magnetic signals without heat or deformation. This newly revealed magnetic sensitivity to stress opens a powerful, non‐destructive pathway to detecting paleostress fields in the elastic crust, offering new opportunities for improving seismic hazard assessment, interpreting impact processes, and re‐evaluating magnetic records across Earth and Planetary sciences."

Taylor,What Factors Explain the Current Arctic Albedo and Its Future Change?,"The Arctic has experienced rapid sea ice loss and a substantial surface albedo decline, altering its radiation budget. CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) models capture these trends but show considerable inter‐model spread in the magnitude, distribution, and seasonality of Arctic surface albedo. Over land, spread in AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) and CMIP6 is associated with snow cover variations, while over the ocean, where sea ice dominates, the sources are less clear. We compare CMIP6 simulations with observations from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and develop a decomposition method to quantify contributions from sea ice albedo, concentration, and extent. Over the Arctic Ocean, all three factors contribute to inter‐model spread in CMIP6. In AMIP, despite prescribed sea ice concentrations, we were surprised to find an inter‐model spread in Arctic Ocean albedo similar to that in CMIP6, driven solely by sea ice albedo. Applying the decomposition to future projections shows that the largest decline occurs in the Central Arctic, driven primarily by reductions in sea ice extent. After 2045, sea ice extent emerges as the dominant driver, highlighting ice edge retreat as key to future albedo decline. These findings pinpoint key sources of inter‐model spread in Arctic surface albedo and offer insights into quantifying shortwave (SW) radiative effect associated with sea ice responses in future projections."

Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the HPLC–HRMS data set classified SOCs into distinct clusters based on their molecular characteristics. Substantial differences in SOC composition were observed between urban (U) and rural/remote (R) clusters. In ESI− mode, the SOCs in the U cluster exhibited higher unsaturation degrees, oxidation levels, and larger molecular sizes than the R cluster. These compounds were likely derived from anthropogenic sources, such as transportation and industry, whereas those in the R cluster exhibited signatures of mixed sources, including biomass burning, cooking‐related emissions, and local biogenetic inputs. In ESI+ mode, SOCs were scarcely detected in the R cluster but were abundant in the U cluster. These compounds were predominantly reduced and unsaturated SOCs, with more than 85% (by intensity) containing one or no oxygen atoms in their elemental formulas. Tentative assignments for these species include sulfoxides, polycyclic aromatic S‐heterocycles, thiols, and sulfides, likely originating from the use and production of heavy oils. Additionally, volatility estimates suggest that the SOCs identified in this study are more volatile than those found in other environmental media. The findings highlight the unique SOCs composition in snowpack of northwestern China, particularly those detected via positive ESI mode, offering new insights into the environmental, climatic, and biogeochemical roles of SOCs."

 Blood vessels near injury sites rapidly dilate, become permeable, and release serum and leukocytes into the wounded tissue to support healing and regeneration. How the vasculature senses distant homeostatic tissue perturbations within seconds-to-minutes remains incompletely understood. Using high-speed imaging of live zebrafish larvae, we monitor two hallmark vascular responses to injury: vessel dilation and serum exudation. By genetic, pharmacologic, and osmotic perturbation along with leukocyte depletion, we show that the cPla2 nuclear membrane mechanotransduction pathway converts a ~ 50 μm/s osmotic wound signal into rapid vessel-permeabilization via perivascular macrophages, 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5a), and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (Lta4h).

 Hydrogel coatings are a promising strategy to reduce friction and wear in biomedical implants, yet replicating the durability of natural cartilage remains a key challenge due to the inherent trade-off between low friction and high wear resistance. Here, we present a picot-fiber hydrogel coating (PFHC) that mimics the hierarchical architecture of cartilage by integrating a lubricious surface layer with a tough, fiber-reinforced core layer. The picot fibers, formed by folded peptide strands with hidden loops, endow the core layer with efficient load-bearing capacity, while the loosely packed, open-structured top layer preserves hydration lubrication. The resulting PFHC achieves both ultralow friction (~0.009) and high wear resistance under long-term sliding over 100,000 cycles, comparable to natural cartilage. By decoupling lubrication and load-bearing functionalities across distinct structural layers, PFHC overcomes the conventional limitations of hydrogel coatings, providing a generalizable strategy to integrate lubrication and mechanical durability for reliable, long-lasting implant interfaces. Hydrogel coatings have potential in friction reduction, but achieving the required durability is challenging.

Here, the authors show that the curvature-sensing protein FCHo2, not talin, enables inside-out activation of integrin ɑvβ5 in curved adhesions formed at curved membranes. 
 Extensive studies have shown that talin is the essential player for inside-out activation of integrins by binding to the intracellular tail of β integrins. Here we show that, while talin binding is essential for inside-out integrin activation in focal adhesions, it is dispensable in curved adhesions - a distinct adhesion architecture exclusively mediated by integrin αvβ5 and selectively formed at curved membranes. Instead, a curvature-sensing protein FCHo2 binds to the HDRRE motif in integrin β5’s cytoplasmic tail and inside-out activates integrin αvβ5 in curved adhesions. FCHo2 does not bind to a similar motif in the homologous integrin β3. We identify a pivotal tryptophan (W), which is conserved in all homologous β integrins except β5, where it is replaced by a tyrosine (Y766). This tyrosine substitution is crucial for integrin β5’s unique capability in forming curved adhesions. Furthermore, our studies suggest that the phosphorylation state of Y766 regulates whether integrin ɑvβ5 forms curved adhesions or focal adhesions. Overall, our work unveils distinct molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms between curved adhesions and focal adhesions. Talin has been believed to be indispensable for integrin activation.

 The demand for high-performance filters in next-generation wireless communication systems underscores the limited electromechanical coupling of aluminum nitride-based film bulk acoustic resonators. Scandium incorporation enhances piezoelectricity but is hindered by crystallinity degradation and polarity inversion. Theoretical modeling reveals the polarity inversion interface between aluminum nitride and scandium-doped aluminum nitride as a key cause of piezoelectric degradation. This work proposes a dual-optimization strategy that improves crystalline alignment and eliminates polarity mismatch. A single-crystalline aluminum nitride seed layer promotes high c-axis oriented scandium-doped aluminum nitride films, yielding resonators with a maximum quality factor of 736. Subsequent seed layer removal eliminates the polarity inversion interface, raising the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient of resonators from 6.0% to 13.2%. Filters fabricated with this strategy achieve a center frequency of 6.4 GHz, a 3 dB bandwidth of 740 MHz, and out-of-band rejection above 40 dB, indicating potential for Sub-7 GHz communication systems.

Here, the authors experimentally demonstrate control and generation of zero-energy kinks in a topological mechanical metamaterial via acoustic waves and numerically show rich acoustic-wavekink dynamics in highly discrete systems. 
 Kinks are localized transitions between topologically distinct ground states and play a central role in systems from condensed matter to cosmology. While acoustic wave packets (here defined as small-amplitude mechanical waves, sometimes referred to as phonons) have been predicted to drive kink motion deterministically, experimental evidence has been elusive, with only stochastic motion from thermal phonons or quasi-static loading observed. This is largely due to the discrete nature of real materials, where the Peierls-Nabarro (PN) barrier hinders controlled phonon-kink interactions. Here, we report experimental observation of acoustic-wave–mediated control and generation of mechanical kinks in a topological metamaterial, which eliminates the PN barrier by supporting a zero-energy kink. We also computationally reveal the dynamics of acoustic wave packet interplay with highly discrete kinks, including long-duration motion and a continuous family of internal modes—features absent in conventional discrete nonlinear systems. Our results enable remote kink control, with potential applications in material stiffness tuning, shape morphing, locomotion, and robust signal transmission.

 Using Alaskan lake sediment oxygen isotope records (δ18O), which trace the δ18O of precipitation, we establish that abrupt atmospheric shifts occurred during the last deglacial period in the North Pacific-Arctic. The robust lake δ18O chronologies confidently correlate Younger-Dryas (YD) atmospheric adjustments in Alaska with Greenland ice-core records and their seasonal sensitivity are consistent with cooling during winter. In contrast, abrupt δ18O decreases during the late Holocene observed in our records, of similar magnitude as the YD, are best explained by atmospheric modes involving long-distance transport of sub-tropical Pacific moisture. Our sediment cores are among the most reliably dated records yet produced in the circum-Arctic and show that similar decreases in δ18O of winter precipitation during the YD and late Holocene were driven by different atmospheric teleconnections. These results underscore major roles for seasonality and atmospheric patterns in the conceptual understanding of global scale climate oscillations, both past and future.

 The increasing demand for renewable energy integration and scalable power generation highlights the need for efficient and cost-effective solid oxide fuel cell systems. In this study, we present a modular hybrid design framework that enables flexible solid oxide fuel cell scale-up by interconnecting standardized component modules. We introduce a series-parallel configuration that strategically leverages anode and cathode off-gas recirculation to enhance both electrical and thermal efficiency. Through a detailed case study, we demonstrate that the hybrid design achieves 66.3% electrical efficiency while reducing external water use by 59.9% and fresh air demand by 22%, outperforming conventional system designs. We further conducted a techno-economic analysis across four scale-up strategies and found that the hybrid design delivers the lowest levelized cost of electricity at 0.155 $/kWh. Through this work, we have highlighted the critical trade-offs between centralization and decentralization, high- and low-technology readiness level technologies, and economies of scale versus manufacturing capacity.

The results of a global expert survey reveal broad agreement on 13 key elements that should be included in defining transformational adaptation. 
 Transformational adaptation (TA) to climate risks has gained broad interest. While existing case studies and frameworks discuss key dimensions and elements that constitute TA to distinguish it from ‘business as usual’ or ‘incremental’ adaptation, a universally accepted definition of the concept remains elusive. Here we used a three-round Delphi study with experts from across the globe, to ascertain the level of agreement on key elements of TA, and to assess differences across expert types, geographical focus and administrative levels. We find broad agreement on 13 elements that are important in a definition of TA: root causes, climate resilience, time-horizon, diversity of knowledge, depth of change, distributive justice, context specificity, multiscale, restructuring, persistence, maladaptation, avoiding lock-ins and systemic change. However, notable differences exist in what expert subgroups value as important elements. Clarifying what TA entails is crucial for developing effective policies and strategies, ensuring meaningful progress in addressing climate change. Despite the growing literature and widespread interest in transformational adaptation, its definition remains contested. The results of a global expert survey reveal broad agreement on 13 key elements that should be included in defining transformational adaptation."

This study develops unit-level models to address this knowledge gap. 
 The massive production and consumption of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitate the development of end-of-life (EoL) recycling strategies to shape a sustainable LIBs life cycle. Pretreatment, which converts spent LIBs into black mass, represents a foundational stage in the recycling processes. However, our understanding of the impacts of pretreatment on the overall recycling performance and associated environmental footprint is limited. Here we develop operational unit-level models to evaluate the impacts of different pretreatment routes on industrial-scale LIB recycling. The pretreatment routes covered here include mechanical, thermal and chemical routes. We identify the mechanisms driving variability in materials recovery and environmental impacts across different pretreatment routes, cathode chemistries and regional contexts. Our high-resolution analysis reveals that pretreatment accounts for most materials losses and contributes to 16–38% of the environmental impact of LIBs recycling. By identifying key impact contributors, we further propose strategies for targeted process upgrade that could halve environmental impacts during the pretreatment stage. Additionally, this research provides comprehensive process inventories and bills of materials, facilitating further research initiatives, policy design and technology advancement in EoL LIB management, contributing to achieving circular economy in the LIBs sector.

 Soil moisture strongly modulates heat waves and droughts by altering land-atmosphere feedbacks, yet its influence on large-scale circulation remains inadequately quantified. Using large-ensemble simulations with the state-of-the-art climate model EC-Earth 3, we demonstrate that interactive soil moisture has a substantial impact on Northern Hemisphere summer circulation climatology. Two experiments were conducted: a fully interactive simulation and one with prescribed soil moisture states. The results reveal pronounced circulation shifts. Relative to the prescribed case, the interactive experiment drives a poleward displacement of the subtropical jets. It strengthens the polar front jet and enhances land-atmosphere coupling, amplifying wave amplitudes over land by ~24%. Interactive soil moisture raises mean summer surface temperatures by up to +1.5 K and extremes by +3.0 K. These findings demonstrate that soil moisture fluctuations can modify mean atmospheric circulation, with important implications for future summer climate projections."

 In recent decades, the warm-wet climate has markedly altered the hydrological and ecological systems of the Tibetan Plateau, potentially leading to changes in its atmospheric oxidative capacity. Stable isotopic compositions (δ15N, δ18O, Δ17O) of atmospheric nitrate can provide direct evidence on nitrogen oxide sources and oxidation pathways. Here we characterize the atmospheric oxidative capacity transformation over the past two decades (2002-2023) in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau by combining nitrate isotopic measurements in an ice core collected in Anemaqen with numerical model (GEOS-Chem) simulations. We observed a decreasing trend in Δ17O-NO3- from 2008 to 2023 and interpreted it as evidence for an increasing importance of the hydroxyl radical in nitrate production. This trend may reflect an enhanced atmospheric oxidative capacity driven by rising humidity and increased microbial nitrogen oxides emissions associated with warming and wetting trends on the Tibetan Plateau. These findings point to a possible sensitivity of regional atmospheric oxidative capacity to climate change.

 Marine heatwaves pose a growing threat to coral reefs globally, prompting divergent theories on where corals might survive in the near future. However, global predictions of climate refugia often overlook local human disturbances that can negate their benefits. We quantified the relationships between marine heatwaves, local human pressures, environmental conditions, and stony-coral cover using a mixed-effects spatio-temporal Bayesian model. We examined where local human disturbances suppress geographical climate refugia and tested four environmental refugial hypotheses based on latitude, remoteness, depth, and turbidity. While some refugia remained unimpacted by local human disturbances, we identified many potential refugia that are currently suppressed by local human disturbances. The most effective refugia were reefs that experience naturally moderate turbidity. We highlight where local intervention could create or restore climate refugia that are otherwise suppressed by local human disturbances. Reducing local human disturbances in these regions could vastly expand the area of functioning climate refugia.

 Tropical forest recovery plays a vital role in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity, yet accurately monitoring its ecological success remains a persistent challenge. Common proxies such as canopy cover or greenness often overestimate recovery by conflating rapid structural regrowth with the slower processes of compositional reassembly and functional reintegration. This review synthesizes recent advances in remote sensing that enable more comprehensive tracking of tropical forest recovery across structural, compositional, and functional dimensions and at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We evaluate the capabilities and limitations of key sensor types: LiDAR for mapping canopy structure and estimating biomass; optical sensors for assessing spectral diversity and phenological variation; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for reliable structural monitoring under all weather conditions; passive microwave sensors capture plant water content, with Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) serving as a valuable proxy for hydrological function; and thermal sensors for tracking evapotranspiration and plant stress. Crucially, we highlight how integrating these complementary data streams (e.g., fusing LiDAR with hyperspectral or SAR with VOD) overcomes single-sensor blind spots, revealing decoupled recovery trajectories and avoiding misleading ""green deserts"" assessments. We identify persistent challenges, including sensor saturation, cloud cover, calibration gaps, and computational barriers in under-resourced regions. To guide ecologically robust monitoring, we present a decision-support framework that aligns sensor selection with specific recovery dimensions, spatio-temporal scales, data availability, and operational capacity. This framework emphasizes the use of defensible sensor combinations and prioritizes open-access data and feasible validation strategies. Future progress hinges on equitable calibration networks, integrating functional physiological metrics such as solar-induced fluorescence and VOD, developing interpretable machine learning tools, and expanding scalable cloud-based processing platforms. Multi-sensor integration is essential for verifying restoration outcomes to foster resilient tropical forest landscapes."

 The structural complexity of tree crown describes the intricate arrangement and occupancy of leaves and thin branches in the canopy, which is crucial to shaping the stability of forest ecosystem. Numerous studies have provided sufficient theoretical basis and effective quantitative indexes for structural complexity, there are still some bottlenecks, such as: ecological niche occupancy and tree competitiveness have not yet been incorporated into the evaluation system for forest structural complexity; and the in-depth analysis of structural complexity at the individual scale has been ignored. In view of the above limitations, this study proposed a novel synergistic index, namely, the spatial occupancy index of tree crown (SOI) and taken the unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (ULS) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data of 14 plots of typical natural secondary forests and plantation (including six dominant tree species: Korean larch, Korean pine, Birch, Manchurian ash, Mongolian oak, and the plantation of Korean pine) as examples. Firstly, an optimized algorithm (i.e., 3D alpha shape-voxelization (3D-ASV)) was proposed to efficiently calculate the crown volume; Secondly, a coupling index based on crown volume was proposed to efficiently quantify the structural complexity and ecological niche of tree crowns. The results indicated that the 3D-ASV algorithm provides an obvious advantage in estimating tree crown volume, with the highest correlation with AGB (r = 0.63). Crucially, SOI is a comprehensive and effective index for quantifying structural complexity of tree crown, that is, SOI is not only highly positive correlation with canopy entropy, canopy cover, canopy top rugosity, fractal dimension (i.e., 0.72 vs. 0.52 vs. 0.57 vs. 0.40), but also compensates for their limitations in explaining tree competitiveness. We believe that SOI will complement the lack of structural complexity at the individual scale, and has the potential to become an ecological analysis and detection tool of forest structure, which will enable us to deepen our understanding of the theory of ‘structure determines function’ of ecosystems, and further promote the incorporation of ecological theories into forest management."

 Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) is a microwave–derived indicator linked to vegetation water content (VWC) and above-ground biomass. In this study, we improve VOD estimates by optimising key parameters of the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) through minimising residuals between modelled brightness temperatures and those observed by AMSR2 at 10.7 GHz. Guided by a global sensitivity analysis that reveals strong parameter interactions, we jointly optimise surface roughness, effective temperature, and single scattering albedo at each location. We evaluate two optimisation schemes, which differ only in the effective-temperature input: a Microwave scenario, which uses AMSR2 Ka-band observations, and an ERA5 scenario, which uses ERA5-Land skin temperature.Both optimisation strategies reduce model residuals and strengthen the agreement between VOD and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) seasonal cycles, with the largest gains in forests. On seasonal-cycle agreement with MODIS LAI, the ERA5 scenario delivers the larger improvement relative to the Microwave scenario. Performance diverges for anomalies: VOD from the ERA5 scenario degrades in arid regions but retains gains in forests, whereas the Microwave optimisation maintains or improves anomaly agreement more broadly. Consistent with this, the comparison against in situ Normalised Microwave Reflectance Index, a VWC proxy, shows higher correlations for the Microwave scenario, while ERA5 fails to track day-to-day VWC variability. Both approaches resolve known boreal seasonality issues. Finally, improvements in VOD do not necessarily translate into better soil moisture estimates (SM), confirming known VOD–SM trade-offs."

 Traditional surface solar radiation (SSR) estimation methods are limited by sparse ground stations, inconsistent data quality, and inadequate representativeness, while cloud-parameter-based physical retrievals are prone to errors under complex cloud conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a DenseNet-based, cloud-transmittance-driven framework that, for the first time, employs the high-accuracy Himawari-8 radiation product as the training reference instead of ground observations, and uses cloud transmittance as the model target for estimating SSR across China. This strategy eliminates the reliance on sparse ground stations and mitigates errors from cloud-phase retrievals, thereby substantially enhancing model stability. When evaluated against observations from 120 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations, the model achieved an hourly correlation coefficient (R) of 0.92, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 107.2 W m−2, and a mean bias error (MBE) of −0.2 W m−2. The proposed approach demonstrated superior performance relative to several existing SSR products derived from Fengyun-2. The results demonstrate that integrating high-precision satellite products as training references into deep-learning frameworks, while avoiding complex cloud parameter estimation, is a viable pathway to producing high-resolution, stable, and internally consistent radiation products from geostationary meteorological satellites, offering a new perspective for SSR estimation."

 To comprehensively elucidate the effect of the East Asian monsoon on biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) in the background region, 11 BSOA tracers and 2 biomass burning tracers in total suspended particles were continuously collected from 2011 to 2015 at the Kanazawa University Wajima Air Monitoring Station (KUWAMS). The concentration of isoprene-derived BSOA tracers (SOAi) peaked in summer (21.2 ng/m3) and was lowest in winter (3.42 ng/m3). The concentration of α/β-pinene-derived BSOA tracers (SOAm) was higher in spring (12.5 ng/m3) and summer (11.4 ng/m3). The β-caryophyllene-derived BSOA tracer (SOAc) had a peak concentration in spring (2.95 ng/m3) and a low in fall (2.09 ng/m3). The analysis of BSOA correlations with biomass burning tracer, combined with Potential Source Contribution Function analysis and Positive Matrix Factorization Model results, demonstrated that although long-range transportation under the East Asian winter monsoon presents impact on BSOA in the background region, local and domestic contributions remain the dominant factor. From 2011 to 2015, under the variation of local and domestic vegetation and biological diversity, SOAi concentration presented an overall increasing trend (0.34/yr, p = 0.09) while SOAm (−1.52/yr, p < 0.05) and SOAc (−1.36/yr, p < 0.05) concentration significantly decreased."

 Integrated effects of concurrent exposure to multiple air pollutants and extreme temperatures can amplify health hazards and may induce differential health impacts. However, air quality regulations do not take these combined effects into account. In this study, we assess exposure levels for combinations of different ambient air pollutants, extreme temperature, population and mortality in distinct regions of China during 2000-2019. The results show that, during this period, population exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 declined by 4.09% and 3.95% per year, respectively, within the existing regulatory framework governing Chinese national ambient air quality standards (CNAAQS). In contrast, exposure to O3 increased notably, with 2.43% per year. Despite improvements of air quality, under the CNAAQS Level-1 framework, five out of seven climatic regions in China experienced compound pollution events involving PM10-O3, PM2.5-PM10, and PM2.5-PM10-O3 during at least 158 days in 2019. The exposure time to extreme temperature episodes exhibited a fluctuating change pattern during the study period. However, it is worth noting that the exposure time during heat waves increased significantly since 2015, by 2.67% per year. While we highlight the improved air quality in China, we underscore the imperative for prioritized interventions targeting specific pollutants and their co-occurring phenomena for different climatic regions, particularly under climate-driven temperature escalation observed since 2015."

 This study investigates the impacts of urbanization on typhoon-induced precipitation in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region by employing the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-ARW), with Typhoon Mangkhut selected as a case study. Unlike previous studies that focused solely on the effects of urban expansion on typhoon-induced precipitation, this research explicitly quantifies the impact of urban spatial layouts. To achieve this, we design a series of numerical experiments comprising one control experiment (CTR) and three distinct urbanization scenarios: no-urban (NU), compact urban expansion (UEC), and dispersed urban expansion (UED). The results show that changes in the urban underlying surface exert negligible influence on the track and intensity of Typhoon Mangkhut, but substantially modulate the intensity and spatial distribution of typhoon-induced precipitation. Specifically, the UEC scenario leads to a significant amplification of extreme precipitation within urban regions, thereby increasing the likelihood of concentrated heavy rainfall events and related flooding. Conversely, the UED scenario tends to trigger large-scale moderate-to-heavy precipitation across broader regions rather than localized extremes. A detailed analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms further reveals that the UEC scenario is characterized by reduced near-surface wind speeds but enhanced wind field convergence. These dynamic processes effectively facilitate the upward transport of moist air and the formation of extreme precipitation. In the UED scenario, while thermal disturbances are more pronounced, the associated wind convergence is notably weaker, resulting in relatively lower precipitation magnitudes. This contrast highlights the dominant role of dynamic processes in enhancing typhoon-induced precipitation in the study region. These findings underscore the critical influence of urban spatial structure on regulating the intensity and spatial distribution of such precipitation events, thereby addressing a key research gap concerning how distinct urban layouts modulate typhoon rainfall and the associated physical mechanisms. Consequently, in the PRD and other coastal regions, urban planning should explicitly incorporate the response mechanisms of typhoon precipitation to urbanization, which is essential for balancing socioeconomic development with the urgent need to enhance urban resilience to disasters, particularly in the context of future urban expansion and climate change."

 Continuing current involves substantial charge transfer and is considered a primary cause of lightning-related hazards. Many studies have suggested that the transferred charge primarily originates from the extension of intra-cloud lightning channels, but the relationship between charge transfer and lightning channel extension remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between intra-cloud lightning channel extension and charge transfer during initial continuous current (ICC) and continuing current (CC). CC is further categorized by duration into traditional continuing current (TCC) and questionable continuing current (QCC). The results show that the duration increases with increasing intra-cloud channel length during ICC, TCC, and QCC. The three types of processes exhibit distinct charge transfer characteristics. ICC shows a slow charge transfer pattern. The charge transfer has a strong linear correlation with channel length during ICC (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.81), with 22.71% of the charge released in the first 25% of the duration. QCC shows a fast charge transfer pattern. Charge transfer during QCC is mainly associated with the main channel length during the cut-off interval (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.645), with 90.55% of the charge released in the first 25% of the duration. TCC shows an intermediate charge transfer pattern (68.57% of the charge is released in the first 25% of the duration). Its charge transfer is influenced by two factors: the main channel length during cut-off interval (LCI-main) and the channel length during TCC (LTCC-tot). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for the summed length is 0.737, with LTCC-tot being the dominant factor. Additionally, TCC can be further divided into two modes: a high-current, short-duration type dominated by LCI-main, and a low-current, long-duration type dominated by LTCC-tot."

 Pre-monsoon rainfall (PMR) over India, occurring during March–May, plays a crucial role in mitigating heat stress, replenishing soil moisture, supporting agricultural planning, and sustaining water resources prior to the onset of the Indian Summer Monsoon. This study investigates the spatiotemporal variability and evolving dynamics of PMR over India during 1963–2022 by comparing two multi-decadal periods: the Past Decades (PD: 1963–1992) and the Recent Decades (RD: 1993–2022). The analysis integrates high-resolution rainfall observations from the India Meteorological Department with ERA5 reanalysis datasets, including sea surface temperature (SST), relative humidity (RH), soil moisture, total precipitable water (TPW), surface solar radiation, and wind fields at 850 hPa and 200 hPa. The results reveal a marked intensification of PMR during RD, with significant increases in both rainfall amount and the frequency of rainy days (>2.5 mm day−1) over southern, central, and western India, while northern and northeastern regions exhibit notable declines. This spatial reorganization of rainfall is closely linked to basin-wide Indian Ocean warming, particularly over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, which has enhanced atmospheric moisture availability and convective potential. Increased TPW, elevated near-surface RH, and higher moist static energy indicate strengthened thermodynamic instability, supported by circulation changes marked by weakened low-level anticyclonic flow over the Arabian Sea and enhanced upper-level divergence over peninsular and central India. These conditions collectively favour deep convection and vertical moisture transport during the pre-monsoon season. Multi-model simulations from six CMIP6 climate models independently reproduce the observed RD–PD rainfall increase, reinforcing confidence in the observational findings. Overall, the results suggest that the combined influence of large-scale oceanic warming and locally enhanced convective instability has created a more favourable environment for pre-monsoon convection over India in recent decades. Improving the representation of these coupled land–ocean–atmosphere feedbacks in seasonal forecasting systems is therefore essential for advancing climate adaptation strategies in agriculture, disaster preparedness, and water resource management under a rapidly warming climate."

 The Northern Hemisphere dust belt (NHDB) is a critical region for dust emission and transport, significantly influencing global climate and environmental systems. However, a comprehensive three-dimensional understanding of its dust distribution and transport structure has been limited. This study quantitatively characterizes the vertical profiles of dust mass concentration (DMC), horizontal dust transport flux rate (DFR), and dust mass flux divergence (DFD) over the NHDB by synergistically analyzing the CALIOP observations (2007–2016), the MERRA-2 reanalysis and DustCOMM dust property data. We reveal three key findings: (1) Central Asian deserts exhibit the highest dust uplift, with the top heights of their dust mass layers remaining above 4.5 km year-round and low-DMC (LDMC) layers persisting above 10 km, while North African and northern Arabian deserts show intermediate heights. Crucially, DMC for most sources does not decay exponentially with height, challenging conventional model parameterizations. (2) Dust transport exhibits complex vertical decoupling, in that monsoon-driven flows over South Asia cause dust transport direction to rotate with height, forming distinct stratified layers, while Central Asian deserts maintain stable southeastward transport toward the Tibetan Plateau. (3) The upper troposphere dust belt (UTDB) exhibits seasonally shifting uplifting regions—from the Arabian Peninsula, inland Central Asia, and the Mongolian Plateau in spring to the Tibetan Plateau especially in autumn and winter, with deposition zones migrating correspondingly from the North China Plain to southern China. These results provide critical observational constraints for improving the representation of dust vertical transport in climate models."

 Accurate weather forecasts are important to society and to the economy. However, the extent to which surface air temperature (SAT) can be reliably predicted remains largely unknown. The nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent (NLLE) method takes account of nonlinearity, which governs the evolution of initial error growths in chaotic systems such as the atmosphere and ocean. Using the NLLE method and the ensemble forecasts of summer SAT derived from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 2009 to 2018, the upper limit of atmospheric predictability can be quantitatively estimated. This study directly applies the NLLE method to explore the upper limit of summer SAT predictability at a synoptic timescale over East Asia (EA). We investigate the upper limit and error growth dynamics for summer SAT over all EA and separately over northern EA (NEA) and southern EA (SEA). Our results show that the upper predictability limits for summer SAT over EA, NEA, and SEA are all 12 days, but there are different error growth dynamics in NEA and SEA. Considering a 15-day forecast period, we found that forecast error growths and rates are larger for SEA than for NEA during the early period, whereas the reverse is true during the later forecast period. Forecast error growths and rates over NEA and SEA also have different spatial structures. Smaller forecast error growths and lower rates occur mainly in western and northern regions of NEA throughout the forecast time, whereas southern regions of SEA have smaller forecast error growths and lower rates than northern regions. Our results will have practical guiding significance for the operational forecasts over EA."

We examine how volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides, and nitrous acid influence hydroxyl radical, ozone, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) based on three aircraft campaigns over the United States. Our analyses reveal variable, highly elevated hydroxyl radical concentrations in the first 2 hours, resulting in evident fire-to-fire variability in VOCs oxidation and in ozone and PAN production. About 40 to 70% of the variability is explained by chemical aging. Ozone production in the plumes is usually VOC-limited for the first 2 hours and then nitrogen oxide limited downwind. Box model results for hydroxyl radical, ozone, and most VOCs, using the full, explicit Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) mechanism, suggest no major gaps in the current best knowledge of gas-phase chemistry. However, the MCM sometimes overestimates PAN due to underestimated nitrogen oxide sinks. GEOS-Chem, a widely used chemical transport model with a reduced mechanism, generally underperforms because of incomplete VOC representation. We identify these critical pathways to guide future model development."

However, the interactions between EOC and nonmalignant cells before peritoneal metastasis remain unclear. To investigate this, whole EOC spheroids were observed using a multiphoton microscope, and their invasion ability was assessed. Mesothelial cells were identified as notable components of ascites through morphological assessment, immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Almost all EOC cells were spheroids, with 60% containing mesothelial cells. EOC cells quickly generate aggregated spheroids with mesothelial cells, and these aggregated cancer-mesothelial spheroids (ACMSs) invade collagen or mesothelial layers. Mesothelial cells forming ACMSs initiated the invasion. RNA sequencing analysis revealed marked RNA expression changes in mesothelial cells, whereas the changes in EOC cells were minor. Transforming growth factor–β1–stimulated mesothelial cells showed increased invadopodium formation along with fascin-1 up-regulation. These findings suggest that EOC cells alter mesothelial cells through ACMSs, thereby elucidating the rapid spread of EOC in the abdominal cavity."

This phenotype has evolved convergently in differentS. aureuslineages via mutations in distinct gene loci driving overexpression of the protease aureolysin.

Tail amputation, however, induced expansion of MuSC potential yielding clonal contribution to muscle, connective tissue including cartilage, pericytes, and fibroblasts. This expanded potential was not observed during limb regeneration, and cross-transplantation showed that these differences in potential are likely intrinsically determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiling revealed that tail MuSCs revert to an embryonic mesoderm–like state. Through genetic manipulation involving the overexpression of constitutively active transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptors orSmad7(antagonist of TGF-β signaling) in MuSCs, we demonstrated that the levels of TGF-β signal determine the fate outcome of MuSCs to connective tissue lineage or muscle, respectively.

Using imaging and molecular analysis, we show conservation of biogenesis, morphology, and protein composition of planarian EVs. Environmental stressors significantly elevate EV release, indicating that planarians dynamically regulate vesicle production. Functionally, planarian EVs mediate intercellular communication by transferring regulatory signals: We find that they shuttle small RNAs that effect systemic RNA interference (RNAi) throughout the organism. Notably, gene knockdown experiments reveal a crucial role for AGO-3, a member of the Argonaute family of proteins, in modulating the association of small interfering RNAs with EVs, linking the intracellular RNAi machinery to EV-based signaling.

Genetic complementation restores these readouts to wild type, and purified EhxA in bacteria-free assays recapitulates them while localizing to intact RBC membranes. By contrast, Δstx2mutants do not elicit these RBC phenotypes, distinguishing this pathway from Shiga toxin–dependent effects. Multiple regression quantifies the link between PS exposure, morphology, and procoagulant outputs. In rats, infection with wild type increased RBC remodeling and venous thrombosis, whereas infection with ΔehxAdid not. Together, the data define an EhxA-Ca2+-PS pathway that drives RBC structural remodeling and procoagulant activation during EHEC infection and nominate RTX toxins as targets for preventing toxin-induced coagulopathies."

Hu,Resolving emergent transient oscillations in gene circuits with a growth-coupled model,"Synthetic gene circuits often behave unpredictably in batch cultures, where shifting physiological states are rarely accounted for in conventional models. Here, we find that degradation-tagged protein reporters could exhibit transient oscillatory expression, which standard single-scale models do not capture. We resolve this discrepancy by developing Gene Expression Across Growth Stages (GEAGS), a dual-scale modeling framework that explicitly couples intracellular gene expression to logistic population growth. Using a chemical reaction network model with growth phase–dependent rate-modifying functions, GEAGS accurately reproduces the observed transient oscillations and identifies amino acid recycling and growth-phase transition as key drivers. We reduce the model to an effective form for practical use and demonstrate its adaptability by applying it to layered feedback circuits, resolving long-standing mismatches between model predictions and measured dynamics. These results establish GEAGS as a generalizable platform for predicting emergent behaviors in synthetic gene circuits and underscore the importance of multiscale modeling for robust circuit design in dynamic environments."

We have performed a large-scale screen of more than 200,000 30-residue peptides from more than 5000 human cytosolic proteins, achieving 99.7% coverage. We find that 19% of peptides act as strong degrons, 30% as intermediate, and 51% as non-degrons. We identify both known and previously unidentified degradation signals and show that most depend on the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the proteasome. Structural mapping shows that many degrons are buried and likely become active upon protein unfolding. Training of a machine learning model allowed us to describe the degron properties and predict the cellular abundance of missense variants that operate by forming degrons in exposed and disordered protein regions, thus providing a mechanism of pathogenicity for germline coding variants at such positions."

The predominant hypothesis is that macroevolutionary dynamics and climatic niche conservatism explain today’s elevational patterns of biodiversity, but the alternative energy efficiency hypothesis emphasizes modern ecological interactions related to energy budgets. We test these competing hypotheses by examining seasonal elevational ranges for 10,998 bird populations in 34 mountain regions. Multiple lines of evidence support the energy efficiency hypothesis, including that many mountain birds do not seasonally track their thermal niche with high fidelity while simulation models based on optimal energy balancing under current environmental conditions yield predictions that tightly match empirical data. Our results reveal that altitudinal migration, which is widespread yet considerably understudied, is a behavioral mechanism fulfilling the same ecological function as long-distance latitudinal migration. Overall, this work provides a better understanding and predictive capacity for mountain birds under global change."

However, the full potential of electronic 3D printing has so far been limited by the inability to selectively anneal the printed materials, especially on temperature-sensitive substrates. Here, we achieve highly selective and rapid volumetric heating of 3D-printed nanomaterials and polymers in situ by focusing microwaves using a metamaterial-inspired near-field electromagnetic structure (Meta-NFS). In contrast to previous work, the Meta-NFS achieves the spatial resolution and power density needed to 3D print freeform microstructures where the electronic and mechanical properties can be locally programmed even within optically opaque materials. By broadening the material palettes compatible with 3D printing, near-field microwave 3D printing with Meta-NFS enables classes of electronics that are otherwise challenging to create."

To uncover mechanisms of a long-lasting immune memory, we contrasted varicella zoster virus antigen–specific memory T cell responses in adults vaccinated at young (<20 years) or older age (>50 years) with a live-attenuated vaccine conferring durable protection only when given at young age or with an adjuvanted component vaccine eliciting long-lasting immunity in older adults. Unlike VZV-specific CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells exhibited profound age-sensitive changes including memory subset shifts, reduced T cell receptor diversity, and loss of stem-like features. Vaccination of older adults with the adjuvanted vaccine did not restore CD8+defects but selectively enhanced T helper 17 (TH17) CD4+T cells and prevented their conversion into regulatory T cells, likely through lipid metabolic regulation. Thus, durable vaccine efficacy with aging relies on antigen-specific TH17 cells that compensate for CD8+T cell defects."

However, the spatial distribution of Aβ within the human brain remains unclear as the vascular network’s complexity and scale hinder visualization by conventional thin-slice analysis. To address this, we performed three-dimensional (3D) volumetric imaging of the cerebrovascular network and Aβ deposition in autopsied brains with CAA using advanced tissue clearing and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, labeling for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and Aβ. We found prominent Aβ deposition and SMA loss in leptomeningeal and superficial cortical segments, which were anatomically contiguous with deeper Aβ-positive segments, indicating a surface-to-deep progression pattern of Aβ extension. The perivascular plaque density was significantly lower around Aβ-positive vessels. This technology may provide further insights into CAA pathology and is recommended for research on the 3D pathology of neurological disorders."

In contrast to the exposed surface, there are no practical remedies if imperfections form randomly at the hidden buried interface after perovskite film generation. Here, we reveal a severe distribution of residual lead iodide, voids, and grain-surface concavities at the buried interface, which severely trap carriers in inactive regions. To address these challenges, we introduce a potassium dihydrogen phosphate competitive-binding interlayer that systematically reduces residual solvents at the buried interface through strong chemical interactions. Homogenized buried interface along with facilitated perovskite film quality and charge extraction have been achieved, enabling year-round improvements in photovoltaic performance and reproducibility. The resultant devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.3% (certified at 25.8%) for a 0.07–square centimeter device and 25.17% for a 1.028–square centimeter device. The device also demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 97% of its initial PCE after 1000 hours of continuous maximum power point tracking."

These scenarios provide insights into alternative future biodiversity trends and their drivers. Our meta-analysis differentiates scenarios that project biodiversity loss and that halt or reverse the trend based on their quantitative outcomes and explores their key characteristics such as scenario assumptions, drivers of loss, biodiversity indicators and models used. We found that bending-the-curve studies are scarce, and mostly do no account for climate change, which risks suggesting that the trend can be bent too easily. Our findings indicate that bending is only achievable with integrated efforts across different sectors, such as nature conservation, sustainable food production, diet change, and reduced food waste. To better support policymaking, scenarios should be based on model intercomparisons and use standardize indicators to allow comparisons across studies, account for additional drivers of loss to represent the real threats to biodiversity, and include more ambitious cross-sectoral actions to effectively bend the curve."

Here, we report Jug (jumbo gut) phages with genomes of 360 to 402 kilobase pairs that comprise ~1.1% of the reads in human gut metagenomes, and are predicted to infectBacteroidesand/orPhocaeicola. Although three of the four major groups of Jug phages shared >90% genome-wide sequence identity, their large terminase subunits exhibited only 38 to 57% identity, suggesting horizontal acquisition from other phages. Over 1500 genomes of Jug phages were recovered from human and animal gut metagenomes, revealing their broad distribution, with largely shared gene content suggestive of frequent cross-animal-host transmission. Jug phages displayed high gene transcription activities, including the gene for a calcium-translocating P-type ATPase not detected previously in phages. These findings broaden our understanding of huge phages and highlight Jug phages as potential major players in gut microbiome ecology."

Cyclic peptide phage display with more than a billion variants is an invaluable tool in drug discovery. However, achieving efficient peptide cyclization on phages remains a challenge because of the limited availability of reaction sites, which also restrict scaffold diversity. Here, we report an isothiocyanate-derived cross-linker featuring dual reactive groups: a bromide that covalently attaches to cysteine thiols and a thiocyanogen that selectively forms a thiourea bridge with either the N-terminal amino group or ε-amines of lysine, depending on pH. This strategy enables pH-modulated cyclization. At pH 6.5, head–to–side chain cyclization occurs, and at pH 9.5, side chain–to–side chain ligation is performed. Both processes simultaneously generate thiourea scaffolds. To demonstrate the versatility and biocompatibility of this approach, we constructed cyclic peptide libraries using both cyclization methods and successfully selected binders for several targets, including cyclophilin D, murine double minute 2, and Keap1, with dissociation constants ranging from micromolar to nanomolar. Given the broad pharmacological potential of the thiourea moiety, this phage display library opens previously unidentified chemical space with high scaffold diversity and the integration of a proven pharmacophore for the development of cyclic peptide therapeutics."

The NOx−production rate using NBs is found to be 60.4 ± 1.21 μM hour−1, which shows a fourfold increase in the production as compared to the same reaction performed in microbubbles (15 μM hour−1), which is the result from an enhanced electric field strength at the GWI.

Here, we developed a hydrogen-generating nanothrombolytic agent that enables enzymatic clot dissolution in combination with intelligent microenvironment reprogramming. Specifically, we assembled urokinase, a clinical thrombolytic drug, with hydrogenated silicene (SiH) nanosheet and fibrinogen, a substrate of coagulation reaction, to promote thrombolysis. Functionally, SiH nanosheet plays multiple roles in the nanothrombolytics: blocking the functional sites of urokinase to durably inhibit its activity in circulation to prevent systemic bleeding, followed by urokinase reactivation in response to SiH nanosheet self-degradation and prothrombotic microenvironment regulation through the in situ hydrogen generation, which mitigates the oxidative stress of vascular endothelial cells and inhibits their release of procoagulant factors.

Despite recent advances in Western, industrialized contexts, we know far less about how cooperative behaviors emerge across cultures, how normative environments shape their development, and how these behaviors relate to one another. Here, we examined the development of four cooperative behaviors—fairness, trustworthiness, forgiveness, and honesty—in children (N= 413) aged 5 to 13 from five societies: urban United States, rural Uganda, Canada, Peru, and the hunter-horticulturalist Shuar of Ecuador. We also collected normative judgments from peers (N= 163) and adults (N= 86) of each community. We find substantial variation in cooperative behaviors and norms across populations, but, more generally, that children’s behaviors and norms tend to converge toward community-specific norms in middle childhood. We also identify three cooperative strategies—maximization, generic cooperation, and partner-contingent cooperation—whose prevalence shifts with age and differs across societies.
