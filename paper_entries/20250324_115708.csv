Wenzel;Seyed Mehdi Nouraie,Gaseous Air Pollutants and Lung Function in Fibrotic Interstitial Lung Disease (fILD): Evaluation of Different Spatial Analysis Approaches,"Gaseous pollutants such as CO, NO2, O3, and SO2 are linked to adverse clinical outcomes in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (fILDs), particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, the effect of various exposure estimation methods on these findings remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate three spatial approaches─nearest neighbor (NN), inverse distance weighting (IDW), and Kriging─for estimating gaseous pollutant exposures and to assess how these methods affect health outcome estimates in fILD patients. A 10-fold cross-validation showed that Kriging had the lowest prediction error compared to NN and IDW, with RMSE for CO = 0.43 ppm (11%), O3 = 5.9 ppb (14%), SO2 = 2.7 ppb (12%), and NO2 = 7.6 ppb (9%), respectively. Kriging also excelled over other methods across wide spatial and temporal ranges, showing the highest spatial R2 for CO and O3 and the highest temporal R2 for SO2 and NO2. In a large cohort of patients with fILD, higher levels of CO, SO2, and NO2 exposure were associated with lower pulmonary function. The magnitude of association and its precision were higher in SO2 and CO estimated by the Kriging method. This study underscores Kriging as a robust method for estimating gaseous pollutant levels and offers valuable insights for future epidemiological studies."

Besides well-known external stimuli like the light–dark cycle and temperature, circadian rhythms can also be modulated by environmental substances. However, this area remains largely underexplored. Here, we developed a robust Pattern Recognition-Driven Prediction Approach (PRD–PA) that enables the identification of circadian-disruptive compounds from large-scale zebrafish transcriptomic profiling. The approach utilizes a circadian gene panel consisting of over 270 Circadian-Indicating Genes (CIGs) with stable and robust periodicity and combines it with a predictive model, known as the Differential Gene Expression Values of an Individual Comparison Model (DGVICM), that can effectively predict internal circadian phases from transcriptomic samples. By analyzing 692 aggregated gene expression profiles across 40 environmental substances, several were identified as having significant circadian-disruptive potential. These include glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone (PRE) and triamcinolone (TRI)), the antithyroid agent propylthiouracil (PTU), and the widely used UV filter benzophenone-3 (BP-3). Both glucocorticoids and PTU are well-documented disruptors of circadian rhythms, and BP-3’s circadian-disrupting properties were validated through experimental exposures. Moreover, BP-3 analogs, including 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) and 2,2’-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BP-8), were also found to exhibit similar circadian-disruptive effects. Overall, the present findings demonstrated the reliability of the PRD–PA approach for circadian disruption screening and highlighted the presence of diverse circadian-disruptive substances in our environment."

Here we show that temperature and organic matter co‐regulate the sediment nitrate respiration and associated N2O production in China's marginal seas. By establishing empirical equations, we access that 2.8 ± 0.4 Tg Nr (∼26.5% of riverine input) is annually respired via degrading 2.2 ± 0.2 Tg OC (∼12.5% of OC deposited) to produce 15.0 ± 3.5 Gg N2O‐N, which may counter‐balance 15.1 ± 8.1% of the air‐sea CO2 influx.

Entity‐aware (EA) DL models with static features (predominantly physiographic proxies) merged to dynamic forcing features show significant performance improvements. However, recent studies challenge the notion that combining dynamic forcings with static attributes make such models entity aware, suggesting that static features are not effectively leveraged for generalization. We examine entity awareness using state‐of‐the‐art Long‐Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and the CAMELS‐US data set. We compare EA models provided with physiographic static features to ablated variants not provided with static inputs. Findings suggest that the superior performance of EA models is primarily driven by information provided by meteorological data, with limited contributions from physiographic static features, particularly when tested out‐of‐sample. These results challenge previously held assumptions regarding how physiographic proxies contribute to generalization ability in EA Models, highlighting the need for new approaches for robust generalization in DL models."

This study, using in situ measurements, satellite products, and the Weather Research and Forecasting with lake (WRF‐Lake) simulations at Nam Co, TP, investigates under‐ice thermodynamics and lake‐atmosphere flux exchange by considering ice surface momentum roughness length z0m $\left({\mathrm{z}}_{0\mathrm{m}}\right)$, solar radiation transmission, and snowfall accumulation. The results indicate that default WRF‐Lake simulations reproduce the seasonal variations of ice phenology dynamics and thermal evolution patterns but exhibit excessively slow under‐ice warming, premature ice‐off, and overestimated sublimation. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements suggest that the typical ice surface z0m ${\mathrm{z}}_{0\mathrm{m}}$ value 1.65×10−4m $\left(1.65\times {10}^{-4}\mathrm{m}\right)$ is approximately one order of magnitude lower than the default value 1×10−3m $\left(1\times {10}^{-3}\mathrm{m}\right)$, causing weaker water warming, reduced sublimation, and earlier ice‐off. Solar radiation transmission considerably enhances under‐ice warming but also advances ice melt. Snowfall accumulation can significantly cool the lake, postpone the ice‐off date, prolong the ice‐covered period, and substantially reduce sublimation. The simulated under‐ice thermal structure, ice phenology, and sublimation can be significantly improved by incorporating the above three thermodynamic processes simultaneously, reducing RMSEs for shallow water temperature and sublimation from 0.93°C and 1.98 mm to 0.71°C and 0.98 mm.

Different ARDTs have been observed to capture a variety of frequencies, shapes, and sizes of ARs. Due to this, questions have arisen about the underlying phenomena associated with the detected ARs: do all ARDTs detect the same meteorological phenomena? In this paper, we assess eight ARDTs and investigate the underlying synoptic scale phenomena during landfalling ARs along the west coast of North America. We find that during landfalling AR events, prevalent low‐pressure and high‐pressure systems converge and enhance moisture influx toward the landfalling site. We identify that all eight ARDTs identify AR conditions associated with baroclinic waves, with the region of intense integrated vapor transport (IVT) located downstream of the upper level (500 hPa) trough. The magnitude of IVT is enhanced by the strength of the pressure gradients in the confluence region. Although the ARDTs assessed agree on the general phenomena, there are however subtle differences in each ARDT per the clustering analysis we performed. We conclude that the eight ARDTs identify similar underpinning synoptic scale meteorological phenomena."

Kulie,KAZR‐CloudSat Analysis of Snowing Profiles at the North Slope of Alaska: Implications of the Satellite Radar Blind Zone,"Spaceborne radars provide near‐global observations of clouds and precipitation, but ground clutter can result in a satellite radar blind zone as high as 2 km above the surface. As a result, satellite radars may underestimate snowfall from shallow clouds and incorrectly flag snow virga as snowfall at the surface. Ground‐based radar observations provide invaluable tools to assess satellite observations of clouds and precipitation. This study investigates snowfall regimes using observations from 2011 to 2021 at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement North Slope of Alaska atmospheric observatory. Snowfall events identified in the Ka‐band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) are separated into regimes based on the cloud/precipitation layer characteristics: deep snowfall, shallow snowfall, and snow virga. The shallow snowfall regime accounts for nearly half of the regime occurrence (48%) followed by snow virga (28%) and deep snowfall (23%). However, more than half (62%) of the shallow snowfall is likely underestimated and/or undetected within the satellite radar blind zone. Snow virga is incorrectly flagged as snowfall for 7% of the total annual occurrence, but increases to 12% in October. The KAZR regimes and vertical structure are qualitatively compared to collocated CloudSat observations with snow certain/possible flags; the deep and shallow snowfall regime show similarities between the ground‐based and spaceborne radar observations. An assessment of observable snowfall occurrence and accumulation at varying reflectivity thresholds in KAZR and CloudSat provide a reference for detection characteristics for current and planned spaceborne radars."

However, discrepancies in TC activity projection between atmosphere‐only and full‐coupled models remain unclear. Here, we utilize the CMIP6‐HighResMIP data to investigate future changes in TC activity, including TC genesis frequency (TCGF) and track density (TCTD), in response to climate warming and El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Results reveal significant variability in TC activity projections between the two modeling approaches, reflecting substantial uncertainties. Fully‐coupled models projected an El Niño‐like sea surface temperature (SST) warming over the equatorial Pacific, while atmosphere‐only models demonstrated a La Niña‐like warming pattern. These contrasting SST responses drive diverse atmospheric circulation anomalies, eventually contributing to distinct TCGF and TCTD changes under climatology and during ENSO phases for future projections. Further detailed analysis reveals that the El Niño‐like or La Niña‐like warming patterns belong to two extreme conditions. It shows a strong spread of simulated SST biases across different models. The accurate projection and simulation of SST magnitudes and ENSO patterns are key to reducing the diverse behaviors of TC activities among these models. We detected three crucial regions, the central Pacific, the subtropical eastern North Pacific, and the equatorial eastern Pacific, that could modulate TC activity in response to ENSO in numerical models. These findings provide critical insights into how global warming and ENSO modulate TC activities, highlighting the importance of model configuration in predicting future TC behavior."

From the first principles, this paper derives the DDA emission estimators with a range of complexity by vertically integrating the 3D continuity equation and simplifying the results under several assumptions and approximations. The connection and difference between the DDA and a widely used divergence method for emission estimation are highlighted. A key difference is that the DDA integrates from the surface to an intermediate altitude instead of to the top of the observed column. This leads to the inherent background removal of the DDA, in contrast to the explicit background removal necessitated by the divergence method theory. Linear fittings are used to account for the effects of topography, chemical reactions, and retrieval biases. Realistic estimators of NOx ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{x}$ emissions using satellite‐observed NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$ column amounts are proposed, leveraging external climatology of the NOx ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{x}$:NO2 ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ ratio and its directional derivative. These estimators are evaluated within a WRF‐CMAQ simulation of NOx ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{x}$ by comparisons with the model NOx ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{x}$ emissions. The DDA estimators consistently outperform the divergence method estimator, and the DDA estimator that considers both topography and chemistry features the lowest root mean square error. Lessons learned from this study using synthetic model data can be readily applied to the usage of actual satellite observations for emission estimation."

Previous studies suggest that CMIP5‐6 model projections fall into two groups of either Arctic‐ or tropically‐driven climate change, especially in the North Atlantic. Here, we present distinct warming patterns emerging by the late 21st century between the first two generations of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM‐LE) and use daily diagnostics to assess associated changes in mid‐latitude circulation. We show that the subsequent versions of CESM represent categorically different storylines of North Atlantic climate change. The first version of CESM‐LE (CESM1‐LE, hereafter LENS1) exhibits severe Arctic amplification (AA) along with minor reductions in jet waviness. In contrast, CESM2‐LE (hereafter LENS2) presents subdued AA, a more pronounced North Atlantic warming hole, and a late‐century climate dominated by upper‐tropospheric tropical warming. Uniquely, in LENS2 during winter, the North Atlantic sector projects less warming in the Arctic than in the mid‐latitude mid‐troposphere. The projected North Atlantic jet is reinforced and poleward‐shifted with reduced sinuosity, blocking, and synoptic variability. The surface weather response includes greater precipitation over northern Europe, more intense drying in the eastern Mediterranean, and a lesser decline in cold extremes by late century compared to LENS1."

Within the framework of climate change, this study treats the rainfall erosion factor as a dynamic factor and examines three types of contrasting precipitation—general, heavy, and extreme—through integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and Geographic Information Systems to reveal differences in water erosion driven by varying intensities of precipitation. The results reveal that over 63% of China's land area has experienced soil erosion during the historical period (1980–2022), with slight erosion being the most common. Severe water erosion is predominantly found in the Southwest Basin, the Yangtze River Basin, and the Yellow River basin.

Future projections (2023–2100) indicate that soil erosion driven by PRCPTOT, R95P, and R99P could increase by 22%–91% under SSP5‐RCP8.5 and SSP2‐RCP4.5 scenarios. Overall, climate change has a limited effect on the spatial pattern of soil erosion in China, mainly influencing the intensity and extent of water erosion and adversely impacting most regions. Extreme precipitation is more sensitive to climate change, making future erosion risks associated with it a critical concern.

Here, we employed the Microbial‐ENzyme Decomposition model to simulate the long‐term impacts of future soil moisture variation on soil C‐N dynamics using the standardized soil moisture index (SSI) across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Our results demonstrated that soil C‐N dynamics exhibited both lagged and cumulative responses to moisture fluctuations over extended periods. Active microbes were closely associated with short‐term (3‐month) change in soil moisture, whereas soil organic C (SOC) and total N (TN) exhibited stronger correlations over extended periods (72 months). Under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario, SOC and TN decreased in wet conditions but increased during droughts, with increases of 28.9% and 13.1%, respectively, under extreme drought conditions. We found that the active microbial biomass was significantly more sensitive to soil moisture variation than total microbial biomass, especially under extreme drought conditions. Furthermore, microbes and enzymes were key drivers of soil C‐N transformations, with soil enzymes displaying the highest correlation with SSI (nonlinear correlation coefficient based on mutual information = 0.81). This study establishes a foundational relationship between soil C‐N variables and soil moisture, accounting for lag effects, to enhance our understanding of the complex responses of these variables under future climate change scenarios."

 The widespread integration of AI algorithms in healthcare has sparked ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy and fairness. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to learn from a broad spectrum of patient data without directly accessing individual records, enhancing privacy while facilitating knowledge sharing across distributed data sources. However, healthcare institutions face significant variations in access to crucial computing resources, with resource budgets often linked to demographic and socio-economic factors, exacerbating unfairness in participation. While heterogeneous federated learning methods allow healthcare institutions with varying computational capacities to collaborate, they fail to address the performance gap between resource-limited and resource-rich institutions. As a result, resource-limited institutions may receive suboptimal models, further reinforcing disparities in AI-driven healthcare outcomes. Here, we propose a resource-adaptive framework for collaborative learning that dynamically adjusts to varying computational capacities, ensuring fair participation. Our approach enhances model accuracy, safeguards patient privacy, and promotes equitable access to trustworthy and efficient AI-driven healthcare solutions.

 Rain-on-snow (ROS) events, defined as rainfall on a snow-covered landscape, pose a significant flood risk. While climate change is altering precipitation patterns and snow cover in High Mountain Asia (HMA), our understanding of ROS patterns and their underlying mechanisms remains limited. This study comprehensively analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution, trends, and potential flood risks associated with ROS (snow water equivalent (SWE) ≥ 1 mm and rainfall ≥ 1 mm) and ROS flood (SWE ≥ 10 mm and rainfall ≥ 10 mm) events in HMA using SWE and ERA5-Land rainfall data. Approximately 37.1% of HMAs have had at least one ROS event during hydrological years from 1979 to 2018 and their frequency increased with elevation. The dominant seasons for ROS production were winter at low altitudes, spring at mid-altitudes, and summer at high altitudes. Trend analysis revealed that lower elevations showed a decline in ROS events attributable to reduced SWE; whereas, higher elevations experienced an increase owing to a shift from snowfall to rainfall. ROSflood events significantly accelerated snowmelt (1.27-times faster than non-ROS events, respectively). ROSflood events, though low-frequent, accounted for 2.52% and 1.55% of the total regional rainfall and snowmelt, respectively, with the main flood risk concentrated in mid-altitude regions around 3.0‒4.5 km.

 Forest disturbance regimes are changing across the globe under the influence of climate change and other global change factors, with potentially substantial consequences for tree mortality rates. Tree mortality has been assessed using field and aerial surveys and, more recently, frequently using satellite remote sensing-based techniques. Rapid detection of tree mortality is often important in decision-making around wood salvage and other potential responses. Our study tested techniques to rapidly distinguish tree mortality in temperate broadleaf deciduous forests following drought and spongy moth defoliation in Connecticut, USA using single-date imagery. We applied random forest classification to identify mortality occurrence and severity using single-date Landsat-8 imagery and compared outcomes to annual USDA Insect and Disease Detection Surveys (IDS). Training data were produced by manually delineating mortality visible in high-resolution (1 m) 2018 US National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery and validated against field plot data. Overall accuracy in mortality detection using single-date imagery ranged from 59.3 %–85.0 % with better results for mortality occurrence detection than severity classification.

 Interactive segmentation of remote sensing images enables the rapid generation of annotated samples, providing training samples for deep learning algorithms and facilitating high-quality extraction and classification for remote sensing objects. However, existing interactive segmentation methods, such as SAM, are primarily designed for natural images and show inefficiencies when applied to remote sensing images. These methods often require multiple interactions to achieve satisfactory labeling results and frequently struggle to obtain precise target boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality one-shot interactive segmentation method (OSISeg) based on the fine-tuning of foundation models, tailored for the efficient annotation of typical objects in remote sensing imagery. OSISeg utilizes robust visual priors from foundation models and implements a hybrid adapter-based strategy for fine-tuning these models. Specifically, It employs a parallel structure with hybrid adapter designs to adjust multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks within foundation models, effectively aligning remote sensing image features for interactive segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the proposed OSISeg integrates point, box, and scribble prompts, facilitating high-quality segmentation only using one prompt through a lightweight decoder. Experimental results on multiple datasets—including buildings, water bodies, and woodlands—demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning methods and significantly enhances the quality of one-shot interactive segmentation for typical remote sensing objects. This study highlights the potential of the proposed OSISeg to significantly accelerate sample annotation in remote sensing image labeling tasks, establishing it as a valuable tool for sample labeling in the field of remote sensing.

 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a powerful technique for addressing the distribution shift across various Remote Sensing (RS) applications. However, most UDA approaches require access to source data, which may be infeasible due to data privacy or transmission constraints. Source-free Domain Adaptation addresses the absence of source data but usually demands a large amount of target domain data beforehand, hindering rapid adaptation and restricting their applicability in broader scenarios. In practical cross-domain RS image classification, achieving a balance between adaptation speed and accuracy is crucial. Therefore, we propose Low Saturation Confidence Distribution Test-Time Adaptation (LSCD-TTA), marketing the first attempt to explore Test-Time Adaptation for cross-domain RS image classification without requiring source or target training data. LSCD-TTA adapts a source-trained model on the fly using only the target test data encountered during inference, enabling immediate and efficient adaptation while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, LSCD-TTA incorporates three optimization strategies tailored to the distribution characteristics of RS images. Firstly, weak-confidence softmax-entropy loss emphasizes categories that are more difficult to classify to address unbalanced class distribution. Secondly, balanced-categories softmax-entropy loss softens and balances the predicted probabilities to tackle the category diversity. Finally, low saturation distribution loss utilizes soft log-likelihood ratios to reduce the impact of low-confidence samples in the later stages of adaptation. By effectively combining these losses, LSCD-TTA enables rapid and accurate adaptation to the target domain for RS image classification. We evaluate LSCD-TTA on six domain adaptation tasks across three RS datasets, where LSCD-TTA outperforms existing DA and TTA methods with average accuracy gains of 4.99% on Resnet-50, 5.22% on Resnet-101, and 2.37% on ViT-B/16."

 Recent advances in deep learning have enhanced crop classification, yet current research still underutilizes the hierarchical information of crop types, limiting classification accuracy. As categories are subdivided, the sample imbalance intensifies, posing a challenge to fine classification of crops. To address this, we propose the Class Semantic Guided Hierarchical Segmentation Framework (SemHi framework) for satellite image time series (SITS) crop classification. This framework effectively leverages the hierarchical information in the class system and outputs classification results at each level in an end-to-end manner. The SemHi framework comprises four modules: (1) The backbone that learns the spatio-temporal features; (2) The label embedding module, a core component that guides the feature learning through the fusion of hierarchical structure and textual representations; (3) The prototype distance measurement module to enhance class separation and reduce within-class variation; (4) The hierarchical logic regularization module, which enables multi-granularity crop predictions and strengthens the hierarchical logic between them. The validation results on the public crop classification dataset show that the SemHi framework with multi-dimensional fusion of spatio-temporal-text information significantly improves the performance of all state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks on fine-grained classes, with an overall accuracy improvement of 0.48% to 13.86%. Furthermore, experiments on a remote sensing classification dataset demonstrate the framework’s generality and potential for broader applications in remote sensing tasks."

 The physical and chemical composition of ambient fine particles is crucial to understand when assessing the adverse health effects of air pollution. Currently, particle health effect estimations as well as air quality monitoring are mainly based on the particle mass (like PM2.5). However, PM2.5 cannot be used to assess the effects of ultrafine particles, nor it cannot explain why in some regions PM mass seems to be relatively more harmful. In this study, the detailed physical and chemical characteristics of urban aerosol, together with particle lung deposited surface area (LDSAal) measurement, were analysed in Düsseldorf, Germany, to understand the aerosol that people are exposed to in a typical large Central European city. Overall, LDSAal, PM2.5 and chemical composition were mainly dependent on the regional aerosol, which was linked to aged aerosol as well as traffic and biomass burning within the city. Near pollution hotspots (airport, river, city centre), LDSAal increased by 14–19 %, whereas PM2.5 increased by 4–13 %. However, a major fraction of particles were smaller than 10 nm, suggesting potential health effects (like brain effects) without clear contribution to LDSAal.

 This study evaluates the spatio-temporal coherence of regional extreme precipitation indices in subtropical Argentina (STAr) derived from rain gauge station data from 1991 to 2021. For the regionalization two machine learning clustering algorithms are used—Ward's method and K-means—and a novel stepwise regionalization approach, HAZ. While machine learning algorithms require the apriori definition of the optimal number of clusters, which varies considerably with the used metric and selection criteria, the HAZ method relies on a Pearson's correlation coefficient threshold and avoids this limitation. In most cases machine learning algorithms struggled to produce coherent regions, with fewer clusters prioritizing spatial coherence at the expense of temporal consistency, and vice versa. Conversely, the HAZ method systematically outperformed machine learning approaches, providing regions with adequate spatio-temporal coherence. Notably, HAZ permits some stations to remain unclustered, allowing to reflect the local variability in extreme precipitation. The overall good performance of the HAZ method demonstrates its potential for broader applications in hydro-climatic studies. Moreover, two intensity indices were unsuitable for regionalization due to poor coherence, while the other three were prone to regionalization throughout the year. The Accumulated index, particularly using the 95th percentile as a threshold, emerged as the most representative, effectively synthesizing extreme precipitation characteristics in STAr. Finally, the necessity of validating the spatio-temporal internal coherence of clustering algorithms outputs is emphasized to avoid mischaracterization and ensure robust regionalization results."

The occurrence frequency of RREs had a significant upward trend during 1991–2022, approximately increased 2.7 events per decade, while the severity slightly declined. Spatially, the highest frequencies of RREs were observed in southeastern China. Based on the movement direction and distance, RREs were classified into four patterns: Eastward Moving, Southwestward Moving, Localized, and Northward Moving. Northward Moving RREs exhibited the largest affected area, the greatest cumulative magnitude, and the longest movement distance, followed by Eastward Moving RREs. Localized RREs had the shortest duration, the smallest affected area and movement distance, but the highest intensity (averaging 92.6 mm/day). Our findings provide new insights for understanding the characteristics of regional extreme precipitation and their driving mechanisms, which are valuable for forecasting and adapting to the resultant disasters."
