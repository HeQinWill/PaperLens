Dolinar;Jasper R. Lewis;Andreu Salcedo-Bosch;James R. Campbell;Ellsworth J. Welton,"Long-term trends in daytime cirrus cloud radiative effects: analyzing twenty years of Micropulse Lidar Network measurements at Greenbelt, Maryland in eastern North America","Over the past twenty years, continuous lidar observations at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center have assessed the radiative impact of cirrus clouds on the Earth–atmosphere system. Findings show these clouds increasingly trap heat as surface reflectivity drops with less snow and ice, contributing to local warming. Continued cirrus monitoring is crucial to refine climate forecasts and support effective climate action. 
 This study analyzes a 20-year dataset (2003–2022) to understand long-term trends in radiative effects and optical properties of cirrus clouds. The research was conducted at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA, the primary location of the Micropulse Lidar Network (MPLNET) project. Analysis of net cloud radiative effects (CREs) at both the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) and surface (SFC) reveals decreases in radiative flux by −0.019 and −0.037 W m−2 yr−1 and −0.031 and −0.068 W m−2 yr−1, respectively, based on constrained solutions for lidar-derived 523/527/532 nm extinction coefficient (m−1) solved for lidar ratios bounded by 20 and 30 sr. Currently,  key cloud properties such as boundary temperature and altitude, as well as integrated optical depth, remained stable with only minor seasonal changes. This study also uncovers a persistent decline in surface albedo, with a derived trend of −0.00036 yr−1. We further find that the interrelationship between CRE and surface albedo variation intensifies notably during winter months. This leads to speculation that a decrease in the number of days of snow and ice is the main driver of the decrease in surface albedo. The observed trends show a complex relationship between albedo, radiative flux, and climate, highlighting the need for continued monitoring due to their significant impact on future climate and weather patterns.  We further quantify trend uncertainty with block-bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals and evaluate sensitivity to solar zenith angle (SZA), finding that TOA trend magnitudes are partially explained by increasing SZA while surface trends remain robust."

Feofilov;Marie-Laure Roussel;Benjamin Witschas;Sophie Bastin,Demonstrating Aeolus capability to observe wind-cloud interactions,"Aeolus spaceborne Doppler Wind Lidar observes perfectly co-located vertical profiles of clouds and vertical profiles of horizontal wind that can be used to study cloud-wind interactions. At regional scale, we show that over the Indian Ocean, high cloud fractions increase when the Tropical Easterly Jet is active. At a smaller scale, we observe for the first time from space differences in the wind profiles within the cloud and its surrounding clear sky, that can be imputed to convective motions. 
 Model based studies have shown interactions between wind vertical profiles and cloudiness, but few observational studies corroborate them. The unique observations of Aeolus spaceborne Doppler wind lidar can contribute to fill this gap. In this paper, we merged global Aeolus observations of cloud profiles at full horizontal resolution (3 km along orbit track) with co-located profiles of horizontal winds.We first observed wind-cloud interactions at regional scale over the Indian Ocean. Aeolus captures the strengthening of the Tropical Easterly Jet in early June 2020, with wind speeds exceeding 40 m s−1 in its core, and a simultaneous increase of high cloud fraction up to above 30 %, until the decay of the jet during fall.Secondly, we observed wind-cloud interactions at cloud scale (between 3–100 km) in different regions. Over the Indian Ocean as well as over cumulus and stratocumulus dominated regions, we found that the wind shear inside clouds is smaller than the wind shear in the clear sky surrounding the clouds (statistically significant). In addition, we found that the wind speed difference between the cloud and its surrounding clear sky increases with the clear sky wind shear, especially in cumulus (R=-0.94) and stratocumulus (R=-0.87) dominated regions. This study demonstrated that despite its coarse resolution, Aeolus can capture wind perturbations induced by convective motion."

Turner,Simulating out-of-sample atmospheric  transport to enable flux inversions,"We developed a generalized emulator of atmospheric transport (FootNet v3) trained over the United States, enabling the emulation of both surface & column-averaged footprints at kilometer-scale resolution. We demonstrate that FootNet v3 generalizes to previously unseen regions and meteorological conditions, enabling accurate out-of-sample simulation of atmospheric transport. Flux inversion case studies show that FootNet matches or exceeds the performance of full-physics models in unseen regions. 
 Accurately estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from atmospheric observations requires resolving the upwind influence of measurements via atmospheric transport and dispersion models. However, the computational demands of physics-based models limit the scalability of flux inversions, particularly for dense in situ and satellite-based observations. Here, we present FootNet v3, a deep-learning emulator of atmospheric transport based on a U-Net++ architecture, which improves generalization and inversion fidelity over prior U-Net-based models.  FootNet v3 is trained on 500 000 footprint examples across the contiguous United States. It predicts surface and column-averaged source-receptor relationships at kilometer-scale resolution and operates 650 × faster than traditional Lagrangian models. Critically, FootNet learns the underlying physical relationship between meteorology and atmospheric transport.  We show that it produces consistent source-receptor relationships when driven by GFS meteorology, even though it was trained with HRRR inputs. FootNet generalizes to unseen regions and meteorological regimes, enabling accurate flux inversions in domains withheld during training. Case studies using GHG measurements in the San Francisco Bay Area and Barnett Shale show that FootNet matches or exceeds the performance of physics-based models when used in a flux inversion and evaluated against independent GHG observations. This is achieved despite FootNet having never seen meteorological inputs from Northern California or North Texas. Feature importance testing identifies physically meaningful drivers that are consistent across both surface and column models. These findings show that machine learning models can learn the underlying physical relationships governing atmospheric transport, allowing them to extrapolate to out-of-sample scenarios and support real-time, high-resolution GHG flux estimation in novel domains without the need for retraining or precomputed footprint libraries."

Newly implemented SF6 chemistry enables stratospheric transport studies. Results agree with satellite observations. The derived lifetimes of six trace gases agree with the literature, but SF6 shows larger sensitivity to the choice of meteorology. The lifetime of SF6 ranges from 1900 to 2600 years. 
 In this work, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), which is often used as a tracer for stratospheric transport due to its inertness in the stratosphere and nearly linear growth rate in the troposphere, is included in the chemistry transport model (CTM) of the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE). Sink and recovery reactions for this species are implemented in the model, which has a top in the mesosphere at 0.01 hPa. The simulated SF6 distributions are compared with MIPAS and ACE-FTS observations and the global atmospheric lifetime is computed from CTM runs driven by three recent meteorological reanalyses: ERA5, MERRA2 and JRA-3Q. The results show that BASCOE SF6 profiles are generally within 10 % of the satellite observations below 10 hPa, although discrepancies increase at higher altitudes. The global atmospheric lifetime is used as an additional diagnostic for the implementation of the chemistry in the mesosphere, where satellite measurements are unavailable. The derived SF6 lifetimes are 2646 years with ERA5, 1909 years with MERRA2 and 2147 years with JRA-3Q, in accordance with recent literature. Due to the large spread of published lifetimes for SF6, the study is extended to N2O, CH4, CFC-11, CFC-12 and HCFC-22, to validate the SF6 results. The lifetimes for these species are in agreement with previously reported values, and their spread between simulations is smaller compared to SF6. This analysis highlights the sensitivity of SF6 to the input reanalysis data sets and thus to differences in dynamics."
10.5194/acp-26-477-2026,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文研究了I2O5在 pristine 和 polluted atmospheres 中的异质水解及其在碘气溶胶增长中的作用，这与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析、气溶胶检索）密切相关，因为它涉及大气化学过程和气溶胶形成机制。,"['I2O5', 'heterogeneous hydrolysis', 'iodine aerosol', 'marine aerosol', 'atmospheric chemistry']",Xiucong Deng;An Ning;Ling Liu;Fengyang Bai;Jie Yang;Jing Li;Jiarong Liu;Xiuhui Zhang,Mechanistic insights into I2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis and its role in iodine aerosol growth in pristine and polluted atmospheres,"I2O5 is known as a significant contributor to marine aerosol, yet the chemical mechanism remains unclear. The atmospheric complexity arises from intricate coupling effects between I2O5 and diverse chemical species. We performed Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics to elucidate the I2O5 hydrolysis mechanisms mediated by prevalent chemicals at the air-water interface. The proposed heterogeneous reactions provides molecular-level insight into the role of I2O5 in the atmospheric iodine chemistry. 
 Higher-order iodine oxides are intricately linked to marine aerosol formation; however, the underlying physicochemical mechanisms remain poorly constrained, particularly for I2O5, which is stable yet conspicuously absent in the atmosphere. While reactivity with water has been implicated, the direct hydrolysis of I2O5 (I2O5+ H2O → 2HIO3) fails to account for this discrepancy due to its high activation barrier (21.8 kcal mol−1). Herein, we have probed heterogeneous hydrolysis of I2O5 mediated by prevalent chemicals over oceans through Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that self-catalyzed pathways involving I2O5 and its hydrolysis product HIO3 substantially reduce the reaction barrier, thereby accelerating the conversion of I2O5 to HIO3 in pristine marine environments. In polluted regions, interfacial hydrolysis of I2O5 mediated by acidic or basic pollutants (e.g., H2SO4 or amines) proceeds with even greater efficiency, characterized by remarkably low barriers (≤ 1.3 kcal mol−1). Collectively, these proposed heterogeneous reactions of I2O5 are relatively effective, acting as a hitherto unrecognized sink for I2O5 and a source of HIO3 – processes that facilitate marine aerosol growth and rationalize the high iodate abundances detected in aerosols. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the elusive I2O5-to-HIO3 conversion, offering an unheeded step toward improving the representation of iodine chemistry and marine aerosol formation in atmospheric models, with implications for climate prediction and environmental impact assessment."

Hicks;Joel N. Oetting;Neal S. Eash,"A simplified system to quantify storage of carbon dioxide,  water vapor and heat within a maize canopy","A new reliable system has been developed for measuring gradients of CO₂/H₂O within surface roughness layer. This development is a part of a decade-long program at University of Tennessee to refine the understanding of maize agriculture in locations outside the conventional realm of perfect sites. The focus is on small farms in complex terrain, such as dominating most of Africa and much of eastern North America. Experience has resulted in a need for detailed CO₂/H₂O gradients below canopy level. 
 The canopy storage of CO2, latent heat, and sensible heat within agricultural crops has not yet been fully examined, particularly on small farms situated in complex terrain. Reported canopy storage terms are consistently smaller than those found in forest ecosystems, such that they are often neglected. Our multiport profile system has been developed to examine these storage terms. The system sequentially samples air from four heights to a single non-dispersive Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA). Following laboratory testing, the system has been field proven in an east Tennessee maize crop in 2023. The new system enables quantifications of CO2, latent and sensible heat atmospheric storage terms and, with supporting temperature measurements, allows improved examination of the surface heat energy budget and the net air-surface exchange of CO2. It offers a valuable tool for a better understanding of gas-energy fluxes on small farms on topographically varied landscapes."

At present, the predictive accuracy for most properties was insufficient compared to routine laboratory analyses; however, several key properties showed predictive potential. We encourage using the open Library as a foundation for further spectral analysis and modelling and we support future soil health assessments via spectroscopy. 
 The rise in demand for soil data and information calls for quick and cost-effective methodologies to quantify soil properties. This is particularly important in the realm of restoring soil health in Europe. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has demonstrated the ability to predict specific soil properties with high accuracy whilst being less costly and time-consuming than traditional methods. To fill gaps in national spectroscopic soil data, we compiled the first Austrian NIR soil spectral library (680–2500 nm) based on legacy samples (n=2129), covering all environmental zones of Austria. We then employed partial least square regression (PLSR) modelling to test the usability of the dataset for soil health assessments at its current stage. Our analysis revealed that the application of the PLSR is not suitable for accurately estimating soil health indicators compared to routine laboratory analysis. Nevertheless, among the 14 soil properties tested, total nitrogen, CaCO3, soil organic carbon and clay exhibited moderate predictive accuracy (R2>0.7). Most importantly, the dataset containing sample meta-data (e.g., land use type, environmental zone or zip code), laboratory reference values and NIR spectra with 1 nm resolution can be used as a foundation for further spectral analysis and modelling. We make this work openly accessible to actively contribute to closing soil data gaps and promote the expansion of soil spectral libraries as a basis for soil health assessments (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15772618, Fohrafellner et al., 2025)."

We created the first global forest age map at 30-meter resolution from 1985 to 2024 using satellite data, showing where forests are young or old and whether they are natural or planted. This dataset helps improve understanding of forest growth, carbon storage, and sustainable management. 
 Natural and planted forests differ substantially in ecological functions and economic values, with forest age serving as a key indicator of their developmental and carbon dynamics. However, existing global forest age datasets remain constrained by coarse spatial resolution and the lack of explicit forest type distinction. In this study, we developed a 30 m global forest age dataset for 1985–2024 by integrating Landsat time-series data with the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform, thereby reducing reliance on ground-based forest inventory data. Building upon global forest distribution products, forest age was estimated from change points in long-term spectral trajectories, distinguishing the age of natural and planted forests at a global scale. Validation using 6,100 globally stratified samples demonstrated strong agreement with visually interpreted references (overall accuracy = 0.72, RMSE = 5.66 years), with higher accuracy for natural forests (0.73) than for planted forests (0.70). Globally, pronounced regional contrasts were observed: old-growth native forests (NF) dominate in Europe (84.38 %), South America (82.61 %), and North America (80.62 %), whereas Australia exhibits a bimodal age distribution driven by both old and regenerating stands. Planted forests (PF), by contrast, are consistently younger, with the youngest plantations concentrated in Australia (Age1–5: 65.77 %) and the most mature in Europe (Age36–40: 53.99 %). This 30 m global forest age map provides a consistent and high-resolution benchmark for improving forest carbon accounting, plantation yield modeling, and conservation strategy development."

Compared to simulations driven by global inventories, CINEI demonstrated better numerical modeling performance in ozone and its precursors (nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide). This study provides valuable insights for designing ozone mitigation strategies. 
 Despite ongoing efforts to reduce pollution, persistent ozone pollution in China remains a public health concern. To better understand the causes of ozone pollution in China and to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of past, current, and planned targeted pollution control strategies, estimates of the amounts of pollutants emitted from various sources are needed. To this end, we have developed harmonized and integrated anthropogenic emission inventories for China, incorporating information from the existing national inventory for mainland China (MEIC) and three global inventories (CEDS, CAMS, HTAP) to cover areas outside of China. The newly developed China INtegrated Emission Inventory (CINEI) includes emissions in China from sectors currently omitted from the MEIC (ships, aviation, waste, and agriculture) that we incorporate from the global inventories. To ensure harmonized emissions data, we performed mapping between different inventories, a process used to achieve consistency between sectors, spatial resolution, and speciation of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). These harmonized and integrated inventories for China were used to drive WRF-Chem simulations for January (winter) and July 2017 (summer). Through a detailed evaluation of model results against available observations, we show that while the direct use of global inventories alone can lead to severe over- or underestimation of pollutant mixing ratios, CINEI inventories perform satisfactorily in simulating ozone (12 % in summer and 43 % in winter normalized mean bias) and its precursors, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2, −0.5 % in summer and 40 % in winter) and carbon monoxide (CO, −50 % in both seasons). Based on the comparison and modeling of this study, valuable insights into the spatio-temporal variability of ozone and the subsequent design of future ozone mitigation strategies in China were provided."

Muller;Glenn Hammond;Xiaoliang He;Peter Lichtner,Modeling supercritical CO2 flow and mineralization in reactive host rocks with PFLOTRAN v7.0,"Subsurface injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used for a variety of purposes including geologic carbon storage and enhanced oil recovery. Recently, CO2 injection into reactive host rocks has been explored as a way to transform CO2 into dense solid minerals. We present a simulation framework for modeling flow of CO2 due to injection and subsequent reactions that take place to mineralize CO2. 
 Understanding the flow and reactivity of CO2 injected into geological reservoirs is important for many subsurface applications including secure geologic carbon storage (GCS), critical mineral extraction, enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Traditionally, subsurface CO2 injection for GCS applications has focused on geologic formations with favorable subsurface configurations for CO2 migration and trapping through non-reactive mechanisms such as structural, solubility, and petrophysical trapping. Recently, CO2-reactive rocks such as mafic and ultramafic basalts have been investigated for their potential to react with injected CO2 in situ to simultaneously dissolve host rock minerals and mineralize CO2 as carbonates. Engineering rapid CO2 mineralization in the subsurface is attractive because of the increased density of stored CO2, the additional safety factors associated with solidification, and the potential to extract valuable critical minerals. Here we present recent developments in the parallel flow and reactive transport simulator PFLOTRAN to model coupled CO2-brine flow and reactive transport for a wide range of injection and production applications involving reactive CO2-brine systems. These developments are based on the well established and trusted CO2 flow capabilities in the STOMP-CO2 simulator. New capabilities added to PFLOTRAN include new CO2-brine equations of state with optional thermal coupling, several new constitutive relationships like capillary pressure smoothing and scanning path hysteresis, a fully implicit well model, and native linkage with PFLOTRAN's well-established reactive transport libraries. A series of benchmarks between PFLOTRAN and STOMP-CO2 verify the newly developed CO2-brine flow capabilities. Demonstrations of coupled CO2-brine flow modeling and reactive transport show how CO2 mineralization can be engineered in reactive host rocks. Finally, an example use case involving copper leaching by CO2 and critical mineral extraction is presented to showcase the strengths of this new implementation. Several limitations still remain, including limited availability of field data to parameterize models. Future work should constrain the evolution of mineral surface area during mineralization and the temperature and/or pH dependence of geochemical reactions for specific systems of interest."

These are more mobile and easier to melt. Ice fracture itself is not well understood, because of harsh field conditions. We propose a novel criterion parametrising this process, and incorporate it into a numerical model that simulates wave propagation. This criterion can be compared to existing ones. We relate our results to lab experiments, and find qualitative agreement. 
 The wave-induced breakup of sea ice contributes to the formation of the marginal ice zone in the polar oceans. Understanding how waves fragment the ice cover into individual ice floes is thus instrumental for accurate numerical simulations of the sea ice extent and its evolution, both for operational and climate research purposes. Yet, there is currently no consensus on the appropriate fracturing criterion, which should constitute the starting point of a physically sound wave–ice model. While fracture by waves is commonly treated within a hydroelastic framework and parametrised with a maximum strain-based criterion, in this study we explore a different, energy-based, approach to fracturing. We introduce SWIIFT (Surface Wave Impact on sea Ice – Fracture Toolkit), a one-dimensional model based on linear plate theory, that can produce time-domain simulations of wave-induced fracture, into which we incorporate this energy fracture criterion. We demonstrate SWIIFT with simple simulations that reproduce existing laboratory experiments of the fracture by waves of an analogue material, allowing qualitative comparisons and validations of the energy fracture criterion. We find that under some wave conditions, identified by a dimensionless wavenumber, corresponding to in situ or laboratory wave-induced fracture, the model does not predict fracture at constant curvature; thereby calling into question the appropriateness of parametrising sea ice fracture with a maximum strain criterion."

This study presents the first development of a parameterisation of blowing snow for a global climate model. Simulations avec evaluated using measurements in Antarctica. Results show an overall decrease of the snow accumulation in the escarpment region of the ice sheet due to snow erosion and an increase at the coast due to blowing snow deposition and increase in precipitation. 
 Recent regional model findings suggest that the aeolian erosion of surface snow is a significant contribution to the overall Antarctic surface mass balance (SMB) through ice crystals sublimation and export outside of the ice sheet. Such findings raise the question of the relevance of accounting for such a process also in global climate models. This study presents the development of an intermediate-complexity parameterisation of blowing snow for the ICOLMDZ atmospheric general circulation model, the atmospheric component of the IPSL Coupled Model. The parameterisation is designed to be a trade-off between physical complexity and applicability in a general circulation model, with constraints on numerical cost and stability. The parameterisation is evaluated with in situ observations using limited-area simulations over Adélie Land. The model exhibits satisfactory results in terms of summer wind speed, temperature and intensity of blowing snow fluxes. In winter, blowing snow intensity and occurrences are overestimated close to the coast, concurring with a positive wind speed bias. In terms of blowing snow occurrences throughout the year, ICOLMDZ exhibits comparable performance with the regional atmospheric model MAR. Boundary-layer moistening and cooling as well as changes in surface radiative fluxes due to blowing snow crystals are also quantified in the simulations. Global simulations at standard global climate model resolution are carried out to investigate how the Antarctic SMB is modified with the activation of the blowing snow parameterisation. Results show an overall decrease of the net snow accumulation in the escarpment region due to surface snow erosion and an increase along the coast due to blowing snow deposition and increase in precipitation."

However, the formation risk of iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs) during these processes has long been overlooked. At pH = 3.0–9.0, I-DBPs including iodophenols and triiodomethane were formed in the ultraviolet (UV)/IO4–/phenol system, and the total iodine concentration in I-DBPs ranged from 4.8 to 451.3 nM. In this system, the conversion of IO4– to hypoiodous acid (HOI) proceeded in two stages: (1) a rapid HOI generation phase, where IO4– first transformed into an iodine-containing intermediate followed by its subsequent transformation to HOI, and (2) a slow HOI generation phase, where iodate (the primary product of IO4–) was photoreduced to HOI. The established kinetic model successfully simulated the two-phase formation of HOI. Treatments of the simulated source water samples with hydroxylamine, hydrogen peroxide, Mn2+, Fe2+, nanoscale zerovalent iron, UV, and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)-activated IO4– processes all resulted in the formation of I-DBPs. The fact that the iodine source of these I-DBPs was IO4– confirmed the self-supplying iodine mechanism of IO4–. Future research should develop technologies that efficiently degrade micropollutants while minimizing I-DBP formation."

Under N-limited and strongly reducing conditions, N fixation and dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium provided additional NH4+ sources, whereas nitrification served as the primary sink by oxidizing NH4+ to nitrate. At low NH4+ levels, NH4+ was mainly produced via deamination of simple mono-N compounds (CHO+1N) found in highly unsaturated low-oxygen (O) compounds and low-O polyphenols. In contrast, at high NH4+ levels, urease-mediated hydrolysis of multi-N compounds (CHO+nN) in highly unsaturated high-O compounds became dominant. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed tight, pathway-specific linkages between functional genes and NH4+-associated OM compounds, highlighting the substrate-dependent nature of geogenic NH4+ production. These findings could advance our understanding of microbially mediated NH4+ enrichment mechanisms and offer implications for the management of NH4+ and other geogenic contaminants in organic-rich aquifers."

Australia offers a unique context to address this bias with its vast arid and semiarid regions, highly weathered, nutrient-poor soils, fire-adapted ecosystems, ancient stable geology, and distinct biota. We present a continental-scale analysis of environmental predictors of soil Hg concentrations based on 2,396 samples from 1,141 catchments spanning 5.84 million km2 (∼76% of Australia). Using boosted regression trees and random forest models, we identified an index of ferrosols as the strongest predictor of Hg concentrations, particularly in the temperate forests of southeastern Australia. Other positively associated factors included loss on ignition (a proxy for soil organic matter), soil nitrogen, leaf area index, and nickel and lead concentrations, while soil electrical conductivity and water availability were negatively associated. We generated a robust, high-resolution (0.005° × 0.005°) national Hg distribution map using spatially explicit random forest models. Unlike patterns observed elsewhere, Hg concentrations in Australia are higher in ferrosols and relatively nitrogen-rich soils than in podosols and oxisols. Our findings highlight the need to address regional gaps in Hg research and emphasize the limitations of relying on regionally specific data sets that do not characterize global patterns."

Freeman,CO2 Sorption in Moisture Swing Anion Exchange Resins for Direct Air Capture: Experimental Isotherm Determination and Modeling,"Moisture swing (MS) sorption is a promising direct air capture (DAC) technology to achieve negative CO2 emissions and counter global warming. In this study, MS CO2 sorption in a model MS sorbent, IRA900, was investigated. IRA900 is a macroporous commercial strong-base anion exchange resin (AER) with quaternary ammonium functional groups. A rigorous CO2 desorption process was developed to desorb all CO2 from the sample and obtain CO2 sorption isotherms as a function of relative humidity, CO2 partial pressure, and temperature. CO2 sorption increased with decreasing relative humidity, decreasing temperature, and increasing CO2 partial pressure. Remarkably, the total CO2 uptake from the sorption isotherms matched the ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the material, suggesting a stoichiometry of one CO2 molecule reacting per active site. An isotherm model for CO2 sorption starting with empty sorption sites (i.e., with the AER in the OH– form) described the experimental data well, supporting the hypothesis that the bicarbonate-loaded AER fully unloaded to the OH– state following rigorous CO2 desorption. CO2 sorption kinetics were studied, and carbon diffusion coefficients were estimated as a function of %RH and CO2 partial pressure. Overall, this study provides a roadmap for the systematic evaluation of MS CO2 DAC materials."

However, PAA may react with halides (Br–, I–) in water to form hypohalous acids, which can contribute to halogenated disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. Meanwhile, coexisting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can reduce HOBr/HOI back to halides. To assess and mitigate the DBP risks of PAA in halide-containing waters, this study investigated the oxidant change and DBP formation in PAA/halide/NOM systems. A refined kinetic model accurately simulates PAA/Br– and PAA/Br–/NOM reactions, revealing that a small fraction of NOM is highly reactive with HOBr and drives brominated DBP formation. Dibromoacetic acid dominated the identified DBPs, while total organic bromine (TOBr) analysis suggested a majority of the unidentified byproducts. In PAA/I– and PAA/I–/NOM reactions, newly determined rate constants enabled good model and experimental data agreement. With NOM, total organic iodine (TOI) formation was the dominant iodide sink, with limited iodate formation. Triiodomethane and triiodoacetic acid were the major identified DBPs, along with more unidentified byproducts. Some unknown iodine reactive species were observed to persist in PAA/I–/NOM systems for hours. Importantly, applying a PAA/H2O2 molar ratio of 1:2 substantially mitigated DBP formation, decreasing known Br- or I-DBPs by 85–90% and the TOBr/TOI by 33–44%."

However, previous studies targeted on air quality improvement, focused on one of the two impacts independently of the other and fail to consider both health and ecological losses. This study establishes a dynamic multicity and multisector modeling framework by integrating emission inventories, future mitigation pathways, response surface models, and monetization methods of health and ecological benefits. Taking the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China as a case, we quantify the integrated benefits of air pollution control and propose coordinated emission reduction strategies of multiple species aiming at maximizing integrated benefits. Results show that from 2013 to 2020, emission reductions lowered annual economic losses by 709.5 billion CNY, with ecological benefits accounting for nearly half of health benefits. NH3 and NOx reductions were found to be particularly effective in achieving integrated benefits nowadays, with an optimal reduction ratio of approximately 0.75 across the YRD, and stronger NH3 mitigation needed in northeastern regions. Carbon neutrality pathways combined with targeted NH3 and VOCs controls yield greater equity, especially benefiting less-developed areas. On-road vehicles and agriculture are identified as key sectors for achieving overall health and ecological benefits. These findings provide a replicable model for multipollutant, multiobjective air quality management in rapidly industrializing regions worldwide."

Developing efficient activators that function at low dosages to enhance the oxidative performance is a key objective. This study first demonstrates that ultralow dosages (1 μM) of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), at least an order of magnitude lower than conventional activators, markedly enhance Fe(VI)-mediated selective oxidation of phenolic pollutants. Mechanistic studies revealed that PPIX readily complexed with Fe(V/IV), enabling the formation of the Fe(V/IV)-PPIX complexes. These complexes served as the primary reactive species that significantly reduced the energy barrier for the oxidation of phenolic pollutants and accelerated electron transfer compared to unchelated Fe(V/IV). This electron-transfer efficiency is further modulated by the binding strength between phenolics and Fe(V/IV)-PPIX, with stronger binding facilitating faster electron transfer. Crucially, PPIX remained stable and was not consumed in the reaction. As a result, Fe(III)-PPIX could be efficiently reoxidized by Fe(VI/V/IV) to regenerate the reactive Fe(V/IV)-PPIX, establishing a sustainable catalytic cycle for pollutant degradation at ultralow PPIX dosages. The robustness of the redox cycling was supported by cyclic experiments, where the phenol removal efficiency remained stable after five consecutive runs. These findings provide new insights into developing low-dose catalysts to strengthen the Fe(VI) system for pollutant degradation."

Franca,Three-Dimensional Settling Dynamics of Environmental Microplastics,"Resolving the three-dimensional settling dynamics of microplastic (MP) particles is essential for developing comprehensive models of MP transport in rivers─both vertically within the water column and laterally across the channel. While previous research has largely examined one-dimensional vertical settling velocities, little is known about the lateral drifting, settling paths, and horizontal velocities of MPs. To address this, we investigated the full three-dimensional settling behavior of environmental MPs collected from rivers and ocean water, as well as from estuarine and ocean sediment. Geometric properties of 127 environmental MPs were quantified by a dynamic particle image analyzer, and their settling trajectories were recorded and reconstructed via a multicamera tracking algorithm. This enabled quantification of a particle’s horizontal drift, tortuosity, amplitude and settling pattern, as well as vertical and horizontal velocities. Results showed that spherical MPs settled with minimal lateral displacement, whereas elongated particles, such as rod- and blade-shaped MPs, displayed pronounced lateral movements, reaching up to 65 times their equivalent diameter and averaging more than twice that of spheres. These dynamics suggest that elongated MPs may have a greater probability for wider lateral dispersion in rivers, increasing their likelihood for interactions with riverbanks and channel boundaries compared to more spherical shaped MPs."

However, the chemical composition and toxicity evolution of forest fire PM2.5 during atmospheric aging remains uncertain. This study investigated the chemical composition and toxicity on BEAS-2B cells of PM2.5 emitted from forest vegetation combustion under different atmospheric aging times (fresh, 2, 5, and 15 days) and explored the intervention of astaxanthin on the toxicity of PM2.5. Photochemical aging promoted the formation of secondary organic matter, NO3–, SO42– and NH4+, and the increase of acidic ions accelerated the dissolution of heavy metal elements in the particle phase. The concentration and toxic potency of PAHs and their derivatives declined with aging due to photo-oxidation. Oxidative stress induced by oxidative potential is a key factor in PM2.5-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Variations in toxicity among vegetation types and aging times highlight the complexity of PM2.5 composition and its health impacts. Importantly, this study demonstrates that astaxanthin, a natural antioxidant, effectively mitigates PM2.5-induced toxicity, providing a promising therapeutic strategy. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced forest fire management, air quality interventions, and the development of targeted mitigation strategies to minimize the adverse health and environmental effects of forest fire PM2.5."

To investigate this, we conducted a case–control study with 990 adults and animal experiments to examine the impact on kidney urate underexcretion. An interquartile range increase in PFASs was negatively associated with the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA%), an index for evaluating kidney urate excretion. Specifically, the association for 6:2 Cl-PFESA was β = −0.18 (95% CI −0.35, −0.02). Additionally, changes in FEUA (%) was negatively associated with uric acid levels (β = −13.42, 95% CI: −15.74, −11.09). Mediation analysis revealed that FEUA (%) mediated 14.22–25.63% of the association between PFASs and the uric acid level. Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) models show that 6:2 Cl-PFESA had the greatest impact on FEUA (%) (weight: 0.585). Animal studies demonstrated a significant decrease in FEUA (%) and changes in uric acid transporters. In the 400 μg/L CI-PFESA exposure group, FEUA (%) decreased by 0.22-fold, while ABCG2 and NPT4 protein levels decreased by 0.622-fold and 0.729-fold, respectively; the levels of OAT10 increased by 1.331-fold compared with controls.

Here, we develop a surface-confined cascade system in which laccase is coupled with metal ions (Na+, Cu2+, Fe3+) to activate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for the degradation of three representative polymers─polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polylactic acid (PLA). The laccase-Cu2+ system (optimal at 0.1 mM) exhibited the strongest catalytic performance, inducing substantial oxidative transformation of MPs, as reflected by pronounced increases in O/C ratios and extensive disruption of polymer surface chemistry. Among the three polymers, PLA showed the highest degradation susceptibility owing to its lower crystallinity, labile aliphatic ester linkages, and enhanced responsiveness to ROS. In situ-generated MPs-derived dissolved organic matter (MPs-DOM) further regulated interfacial redox processes by accelerating electron transfer to metals, stabilizing reduced species, and sustaining ROS cycling. XPS and solution-phase analyses corroborated the DOM-assisted metal redox cycling at polymer interfaces. Multivariate modeling identified humic-like components and oxygenated moieties as the dominant ROS predictors. These findings reveal MPs-DOM as an active redox mediator that reinforces laccase-metal synergy, enabling persistent ROS generation and progressive MPs degradation."

This study investigated the reproductive/developmental toxicity of l-GLA and racemic-GLA in pregnant mice at 13 and 130 μg/kg/day, achieving serum concentrations below or comparable to those reported in humans. Prenatal exposure to l-GLA and racemic-GLA at both doses caused fetal growth restriction (FGR), an approximate 10% reduction in placental weight, and structural abnormalities, including a smaller labyrinth zone, underdeveloped junctional zone, and increased apoptosis. l-GLA or racemic-GLA exposure impaired placental putrescine metabolism by downregulating arginase 1 (Arg1) and upregulating amine oxidase copper containing 1 (Aoc1) and monoamine oxidase A (Maoa) gene expression, resulted in reduced putrescine concentrations. Furthermore, impaired pyruvate metabolism, likely from 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase 1 (Hoga1) downregulation, depleted pyruvate and increased lactate in the placenta. In human placental trophoblast cells, putrescine or pyruvate supplementation rescued impaired celluar migration and invasion caused by l-GLA or racemic-GLA. These results indicate that environmentally relevant doses of l-GLA/racemic-GLA impair trophoblast function via putrescine/pyruvate-mediated metabolic reprogramming, leading to placental dysfunction and FGR.

This study examined MPF release from fabrics containing 30% mechanically recycled polyester fibers subjected to one, two, or three recycling cycles, compared to primary (virgin) polyester (PES). Shedding was assessed under both simulated wear and laundering conditions using Martindale, ICI Pilling Box, and ISO 4484–1:2023 (microplastic from textile sources) protocols. Laundering tests showed no clear difference in MPF release between primary PES and once-recycled PES (rPES-1; ∼ 1.4-fold). In contrast, fabrics with fibers recycled twice (rPES-2) and three times (rPES-3) released about 4.3-fold and 6.2-fold more MPFs than PES, respectively. Fiber release was different under dry-state abrasion than in laundry tests, highlighting the limitations of current wet-state focused assessments. Progressive fiber fragmentation and increased yarn hairiness suggest cumulative structural degradation with each recycling cycle. These findings underscore the need for standardized dry-state shedding assessments and improved recycling strategies to mitigate MPF emissions. While mechanical recycling remains environmentally preferable to uncontrolled disposal, these findings reveal a trade-off in the form of increased MPF release after multiple recycling cycles, which could be mitigated through improved recycling processes and fabric design. Achieving a balance between textile circularity and environmental sustainability remains a critical challenge for the industry."

Meanwhile, heavy metals have been associated with circulating oxylipins, which play crucial roles in regulating inflammatory response. Therefore, this case-control study was performed to evaluate the relationships among elemental exposure, oxylipin alterations, and ADHD risk. We also applied an integrated analytical approach to elucidate the mediating role of oxylipins in the association between elemental exposure and the risk of ADHD. All 40 elements were detected in over 75% of the 561 children, and a total of 125 oxylipins were detected in the cohort of 151 individuals. Logistic regression identified 14 elemental exposures significantly associated with ADHD risk. These were further refined to 11 key elements via elastic net regression for subsequent mixture analyses. The Bayesian kernel machine regression results indicated that the combined exposure levels of these elements were associated with increased odds of ADHD within the 25th–75th compared to the 50th percentile level. The quantile g-computation model also revealed a positive association between the elemental mixture level and ADHD risk, with an odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) of 1.72 (1.56, 1.90) for each quartile of the mixture concentration. Changes in four oxylipins were found to be correlated with three elemental levels. In the framework for mixed mediation analysis, the oxylipin risk score mediated 13.3% of the association between the element risk score and ADHD.

We developed an attribution-oriented framework using aerosol extinction (βExt) observations in Taichung, Taiwan (2020–2022), together with meteorological parameters and temporal markers, in an interpretable three-stage random forest model (R = 0.89, RMSE = 28 Mm–1). Planetary boundary layer height emerged as the dominant predictor, with contributions up to +135 Mm–1 under shallow layers (<200 m). Relative humidity exhibited threshold behavior, rising between 60–85% and decreasing above 90%, consistent with hygroscopic growth and wet scavenging. These patterns demonstrated physical consistency, while temporal markers captured recurrent emission cycles. Meteorology constrained visibility across a wide range (−50 to +150 Mm–1), whereas anthropogenic cycle varied within ±50 Mm–1, with severe degradation when both were positive (about 30% of cases) and improvements when anthropogenic cycle contributions were reduced during unfavorable meteorology or favorable meteorology offset high emissions. These results show that visibility degradation reflects separable yet interacting processes: meteorology sets broad constraints, while emission reductions offer quantifiable leverage. The attribution-oriented framework provides a physically interpretable basis for using visibility as both an atmospheric diagnostic and a policy-relevant target."

This study develops an integrated modeling framework that combines climate change scenarios, building energy modeling, indoor phthalate (PAE) simulations, and health exposure estimation. Scenario analyses under SSP1–2.6 and SSP5–8.5 pathways were conducted across 5 cities in representative climate zones in China to quantify indoor PAE concentrations and associated exposure levels. Results show that in heating regions, elevated floor temperatures during the heating season lead to pronounced seasonal patterns in PAE exposure, while annual exposure remains relatively insensitive to climate change. In contrast, exposure levels in nonheating regions are strongly influenced by future climate conditions. Under SSP1–2.6, exposure in 2080 is effectively controlled, whereas under SSP5–8.5, it continues to rise. The study reveals that climate change–driven alterations in building operation, indoor environment, and occupant behavior may substantially modify human exposure levels, posing a threat to public health.

Here, we demonstrate the polarization of blank ice features in solid rocks at low frequencies (1–100 Hz). We identify two polarization effects: (a) an increase in the response due to the polarization of charges in the electrical double layer formed at the ice‐water‐rock interface; (b) an even larger response due to the non‐equilibrium freezing potential taking place during ice formation. We demonstrate that these effects can be used to image ice features, for instance, during ground‐ice formation and degradation."

Both the large‐scale seasonal transition reflected by EOF analysis and the monsoon onset dates defined by local rainfall exhibited a clear interdecadal change. Correspondingly, there appears reduced rainfall and low‐level easterly anomalies over tropical Asia in May, indicating that the monsoonal westerly winds and convective activities cannot be stably established. Further analysis suggests that the SST warming in the equatorial western Indian Ocean serves as a possible driver of the delayed TASM onset. The warm SST anomalies trigger a Kelvin wave‐like response to the east, inducing anticyclonic circulation and easterly anomalies over tropical Asia, which hinder moisture transport and reduce rainfall. The reduced rainfall further strengthens anomalous easterly winds, thereby favoring the delayed onset of the summer monsoon."

Biases in the simulated tropical Pacific SST gradient across CMIP6 models significantly influence present‐day and future winter precipitation over South America through a stationary wave pattern resembling the Pacific–South American (PSA‐2) mode. Models with a weaker‐than‐observed SST gradient simulate a deeper trough east of South America, resulting in stronger wetting trends over northern Argentina. Applying observational constraints reduces uncertainties in projected precipitation trends by approximately 31%. For Tasmania and New Zealand, SST gradient biases impact the simulation of present‐day winter precipitation, but are not well correlated with future precipitation projections. Our findings highlight the critical need to accurately represent the tropical Pacific SST gradient and its associated atmospheric circulation features for reliable regional climate simulation."

Few of these earthquakes (<10) have been documented in western North America, though it is likely more exist owing to difficulties in resolving focal depth for small earthquakes. Mapping their distribution in western North America is key to better characterizing cratonic evolution in this area. Here, we evaluate 25 nominally lower crustal and upper mantle earthquakes in the Milk River region of southwestern Alberta. We absolutely relocate each earthquake and compare depths to published estimates of Moho depth and find 17 earthquakes locate ∼8–16 km below the Moho. High‐precision relative relocations and first‐motions define a steeply west‐dipping, Moho‐crossing normal fault. We hypothesize these earthquakes are related to regional mantle flow patterns interacting with lithospheric edges and are part of a larger trend of upper mantle seismicity along the western edge of North American cratonic lithosphere."

Using two decades of MERRA‐2 reanalysis data and self‐organizing map clustering, we identified four distinct dust transport pathways from surrounding and remote deserts for the top 10% of spring dust events impacting the Colorado Plateau: (a) intense southwesterly near‐surface transport where eastward upward transport is blocked by topography, (b) substantial remote transport plus weaker surface emissions, (c) moderate southwesterly transport with stronger upper‐level transport, and (d) rare northwesterly pattern linked to the Great Basin sources, which accounts for 38%, 14%, 37%, and 11% of total events, respectively. The frequency and intensity of these events strongly correlate with large‐scale climate variability, with increased dust events during La Niña.

Roehl,Observational Requirements for Quantifying the Diurnal Cycle of XCO2 From Space,"Spatiotemporal variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) provide a means to quantify surface fluxes of carbon over a range of space and timescales. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐3 (OCO‐3), aboard the International Space Station, is the first CO2‐monitoring mission to observe the sunlit portion of the diurnal cycle of total column‐averaged CO2 (XCO2) from space, since OCO‐3 collects data at various times of the day. Previous analysis of the climatological diurnal cycle in XCO2 measured from a ground‐based spectrometer in the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) suggests that the XCO2 diurnal cycle provides information about local fluxes. Here, we examine the diurnal signal at four TCCON sites spanning the tropics through midlatitudes. The signal is typically less than 1 ppm even at the peak of the growing season. Because relatively sparse OCO‐3 data observes a diurnal cycle at a given location only across multiple days, mesoscale transport variations complicate detection of the diurnal signal from the space‐based record. We bootstrap the long‐term records of TCCON XCO2 to quantify the minimum number of OCO‐3 observations necessary to infer the climatological diurnal cycle of XCO2, and find that even during the peak growing season, of order 10 observations per daylight hour for each month are required for robust detection. The number of required observations increases outside the growing season when fluxes are weaker. Our results show that dense and long‐term observation are required to infer the diurnal cycle from OCO‐3 or future CO2‐monitoring satellite missions."

This study compares two Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model experiments, a convection‐parameterized simulation with 12 km resolution (CRM) and a convection‐permitting simulation with 4 km resolution (CPM), evaluated for summer precipitation over Northwest China (NWC) during 2009–2011. Observational and model data were analyzed on a unified 4 km grid and in local time to conduct statistical harmonic analysis and thermodynamic diagnostics. The results show that the CPM substantially improves the simulation of precipitation amount, intensity, and frequency relative to the CRM, especially in mountainous regions. For total precipitation, the CPM yields a regional mean of 81.53 mm, closest to observations and outperforming ERA5 and CRM. Although the CPM slightly overestimates precipitation intensity, it exhibits higher spatial consistency and better captures the frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall. For wet‐day frequency, spatial correlation reaches 0.79 with a Root Mean Square Error of 0.11%, and the regional mean is also closer to observations. The CPM reproduces the observed dual‐peak diurnal cycle with reduced phase errors and amplitude bias. The CRM, constrained by cumulus parameterization, responds weakly to orographic forcing, limiting convective initiation and reducing precipitation intensity. In contrast, the CPM captures moisture convergence and vertical motion along windward slopes, producing stronger updrafts and more favorable thermodynamic conditions for convection. Overall, the CPM achieves simulations most consistent with observations, providing a more realistic representation of precipitation processes over the arid complex‐terrain region of NWC and demonstrating its potential to advance high‐resolution climate modeling."

W. van de Wal,Future Changes in the Annual Sea‐Level Cycle,"Recent projections indicate that the range of the annual sea‐level cycle (ASLC) may increase, affecting flood risk, groundwater, and ecosystems. However, existing projections have several limitations, such as their exclusion of the inverse‐barometer effect, their uncertainty due to internal variability, and/or their regional focus. Furthermore, the historical ASLC in the climate models used for these projections was not extensively evaluated. Here, we address these limitations using a large ensemble of simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6. Compared to observations, we find that four climate models perform particularly poorly. Excluding these, our multi‐model median projections for 2071–2100 indicate an average increase in the ASLC range at tide‐gauge locations of 7.9% under a high emissions scenario. Changes under lower scenarios are similar spatially but have a smaller magnitude. Regions with above‐average changes include Northwestern Europe, the Mediterranean, Asia, and the North Pacific. In several regions, the inverse‐barometer effect substantially contributes to the total changes. The median projected shifts in the peak month of the ASLC are mostly small, but like for the projected range changes, larger changes cannot be excluded given the substantial uncertainties. Finally, we find that the ASLC changes translate to differences between seasonal and annual mean sea‐level changes of up to 5.4 cm under the highest emissions scenario. Consequently, sea‐level projections that exclude seasonal changes under‐ or overestimate total sea‐level change in specific seasons, sometimes by more than 8%. This will influence projections of hazards and impacts tied to specific seasons."

 The mesopelagic zone, between 100 m and 1,000 m depth, is a crucial layer in which carbon preliminary coming down from the surface is transformed before a portion makes it into the deep ocean. While eddies and their fronts influence surface productivity and carbon export, their effects deeper in the water column remain poorly understood. Here we show the importance and contribution of dark carbon fixation—the conversion of inorganic into organic carbon by prokaryotes—across five contrasting hydrological features in the North Atlantic, using isotopic tracers and quantification of chemoautotrophy genes. The approach allows simultaneous assessment of dark carbon fixation and heterotrophic activity of prokaryotes living suspended in seawater and attached to gravitationally settling particles. Our results highlight that heterotrophic prokaryotes attached to sinking particles contribute up to 21% of the total organic carbon required to sustain prokaryotic metabolism under the influence of eddy fronts. By contrast, dark carbon fixation by suspended prokaryotes can contribute up to half of the total carbon input to the mesopelagic zone in the cyclonic eddy. Our findings challenge the idea that carbon cycling in the mid-depth ocean is uniform and highlight the need to integrate microbial fractions and physical heterogeneity into ocean carbon models.

 Sea surface temperature directly beneath tropical cyclones is crucial for their intensification. In the long term, global warming heats the surface oceans, intensifying tropical cyclones, whereas concurrently with a cyclone, inner-core surface cooling is induced by the cyclone itself curtailing its intensification. However, the magnitude of cyclone-induced cooling, or the trend in storm-local sea surface temperature, remains uncertain. Here we provide a quantification using global surface drifter data from 1992 to 2021. We find that storm-local sea surface temperatures are rising at 0.29 ± 0.07 °C per decade—about twice the average rate in tropical cyclone-active regions despite enhanced cyclone-induced cooling; furthermore, the magnitude of cyclone-induced inner-core cooling is far smaller than previous estimates. The inner-core cooling measured by drifters is −0.68 ± 0.04 °C, substantially less than microwave satellite estimates (−1.05 ± 0.06 °C). State-of-the-art climate models tend to overestimate inner-core cooling while underestimating storm intensity. These findings offer observational benchmarks for models and suggest that current projections may underestimate the strength, frequency and impacts of major tropical cyclones.

In the RILI mouse model, the nanogel demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis activity, with no observed systemic toxicity.

Van Lange et al. report an inverted correlation in a class of polymeric materials, implying a special role of long-ranged ionic interactions in vitrification. 
 Supercooled liquids undergo a rapid change in dynamics as they are cooled to their glass transition temperature and turn from a flowing liquid into an amorphous solid. Depending on how steeply the viscosity changes with temperature around the glass transition, glass formers are classified as strong or fragile. An empirical relation exists between the fragility of the liquid and the non-exponentiality of its α-relaxation. However, the microscopic origins of this correlation remain unclear and its generality has been debated. Here, we demonstrate that this relationship is inverted in organic materials with ionic interactions. We introduce a class of materials consisting of highly charged hydrophobic polymers cross-linked via moderated ionic interactions, and show that these combine a strong glass transition with an unusually stretched mechanical relaxation spectrum. By surveying a large variety of ionic liquids, polymerized ionic liquids, and ionomers, we show that all these charged materials follow a trend between fragility and non-exponential relaxation that is opposite to that of non-charged materials. This finding suggests a special role of long-ranged ionic interactions in vitrification and opens up a route toward developing new materials that combine the processability of strong glass formers with the mechanical dissipation of polymers.

Here, a bulk-cusp microstructure enables programmable 0–4 directional droplet spreading without external energy, driven by precursor film dynamics and capillary forces, offering potential for improved lubrication and smart cooling applications. 
 Controllable wetting of liquid on solid surface is meaningful for advanced science and engineering. Current researches about controllable liquid spreading are generally limited to unidirectional modes, while achieving multi-directional spreading on microstructured surfaces remains challenging. Herein, we propose a novel type of bulk-cusp microstructure, exhibiting 0 to 4-directional spreading of droplet without external energy input. This behavior occurs not only under single-drop deposition but also under continuous liquid injection. The bulk structure is assumed to have cross or square shape, implying relatively high and low coverage ratio of the precursor film, respectively. Owing to the drag effect of the precursor film, the cross-cusp microstructure facilitates controllable spreading of the main droplet, whereas the square-cusp microstructure just has guidance action on precursor film due to its low coverage ratio. Mechanism analysis reveals the capillary forces generated from the narrow gaps between adjacent cusps effectively separate the precursor film. The area coverage ratio of precursor film determined by the shape of the bulk influences the coupling or decoupling of the droplet body and precursor film. Such controllable multi-directional liquid spreading enables applications in lubrication enhancement and smart evaporation cooling.

 Protein phase separation has emerged as a crucial mechanism for spatiotemporal regulation of intracellular processes, yet its potential to integrate and compute diverse extracellular signals is not fully understood. Here, we show a mechano-biochemical circuit that harnesses phase separation to process mechanical and biochemical inputs, modulating cell fate decisions. We demonstrate that volumetric compression bidirectionally regulates canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, where the presence of Wnt ligands determines the locations of AXIN phase separation to form either LRP6 signalosomes on the cell membrane or β-catenin destruction complexes in the cytosol, while the mechanical stimulus promotes degree of phase separation to amplify either the positive or negative signal. This circuit enhances healthy intestinal organoid proliferation while suppressing patient-derived colorectal cancer organoid growth, revealing its potential for precise mechanotherapy. Our findings establish phase separation as a critical component in mechanical signal transduction and provide a framework for integrating mechanical and biochemical cues in cellular decision-making. This approach opens avenues for targeted therapies and deepens our understanding of how cells process complex environmental information.

A meta-analysis now quantifies this perception gap, showing that its global and regional variation depends on who the ‘other’ is. 
 In mitigating and adapting to climate change-related risks, unbiased risk assessments are essential. Yet individuals systematically rate their personal risks as lower than those of others, believing themselves to be less at risk than others (that is, a self–other discrepancy). In a preregistered multi-level meta-analysis, we estimate the overall effect and boundary conditions for a self–other discrepancy in climate change-related risk perceptions. The synthesis incorporated 60 datasets, comprising 83 effect sizes from 70,337 participants across 17 countries. Results revealed that in 81 of 83 datasets, participants perceived their personal climate change-related risks as lower than others (d = −0.54, 95% CI [−0.68, −0.39]). This skewness was robust across specific extreme weather-related hazards and general climate change-related risks. Notably, the self–other discrepancy was less pronounced when comparisons involved specific others (for example, neighbours) or high-risk regions (for example, Asia), and more pronounced when the referents were compatriots or humanity as a whole or when the context was low-risk regions (for example, Europe). These results highlight a critical implication for the general public and a challenge for risk communicators: a widespread misperception, where people perceive personal climate change-related risks as lower than others, may hinder public engagement in mitigation and adaptation efforts.

 Storm-induced coastal extreme sea levels (ESLs) pose severe threats to infrastructure, economies, and ecosystems. However, projecting future ESL changes is hindered by the coarse resolution of climate models used in assessment reports, which fail to accurately capture tropical cyclones (TCs) and nor’easters. Here, we demonstrate that high-resolution Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulations realistically reproduce observed wind- and pressure-induced daily-mean extreme dynamic sea levels (DSLs), including the most extreme events. Under a high-emission scenario, we show that 50-year return DSLs (DSL50) decrease along the U.S. Texas and Northeast coasts but increase along the U.S., Louisiana, and Southeast coasts from 2006 to 2100, creating substantial spatial discrepancies between total DSL50 changes and mean DSL rise. Along the Gulf and Southeast coasts, DSL50 trends are primarily driven by TC frequency changes, while nor’easter frequency changes tend to govern trends along the Northeast coast. These findings challenge the traditional assumption of stationarity in storm-induced ESLs, underscore the importance of high-resolution climate models for regional coastal risk assessment, and represent a critical step toward more accurate projections of future ESLs in a warming climate."

 The mountainous Third Pole is a critical source of freshwater for water resource management across Asia, yet the historical and future dynamics of per-capita freshwater supply in this region remain poorly constrained by observations from a coherent, pan-regional perspective. Here, we show that by the end of the 21st century, mountain runoff in the Third Pole’s monsoon domain will increase substantially, whereas runoff in the westerlies domain will experience a non-significant decline. This finding challenges the prevailing paradigm that future runoff across the entire Third Pole will follow a unidirectional increasing trend as future precipitation. Regarding long-term freshwater availability till the end-of-21-century (1960‒2100), although mountain runoff shows a contrasting pattern with increase (decrease) at first and then decrease (increase) in the westerlies (monsoon) domain, the per-capita freshwater supply (for mountain basins and their downstream dependent regions) drops a lot in both westerlies and monsoon domains from the past (1960‒1970) to the near future (2030‒2050) due to rapid population increase.

 The Asian Water Towers play a crucial role by storing and releasing vast amounts of freshwater, thereby sustaining the base flow of major Asian rivers and water security for billions of people at sub-continent to hemispheric scales. Instrumental records, though spatially and temporally limited, indicate rapid warming in High Asia. However, the sensitivity and long-term resilience of these Water Towers remain uncertain. Here, we use an 814-year-long tree-ring record (including tree-ring width and maximum latewood density) from Picea likiangensis on the eastern Tibetan Plateau to develop a summer (June-September) temperature reconstruction. Our reconstruction reveals that the series has warmed by 1.5 °C during the modern observational period (1970–2023), which is 0.5 ± 0.4 °C above the pre-industrial baseline (1210–1850 or 1850-1900), making the summer of 2024 the warmest in the past eight centuries. This unprecedented warming amplifies winter runoff in the Brahmaputra, Indus, and Salween headwaters through a cascade of atmosphere-cryosphere feedbacks: enhanced meltwater and spring soil-moisture persistence promote earlier and lusher vegetation growth, which reduces summer albedo and further accelerates regional warming. Detection and attribution analyses identify volcanic and solar forcing as the main drivers of natural, pre-industrial variability before 1850 CE, whereas anthropogenic forcing is detected with high confidence (exceeding the 99% confidence level) after 2020 CE."

 Climate change and land use change are crucial determinants of crop water consumption, particularly in drylands where water scarcity limits crop production. In Central Asia, the effects of land use and climate changes on crop water consumption remain unknown. We estimated the dynamics of crop water consumption by mapping annual actual evapotranspiration from Landsat imagery from 1987 to 2019 for all irrigated croplands in the Amu Darya Basin, the largest transboundary river in Central Asia. Total crop water consumption increased by 10%, while average consumption per unit area increased by 18%. Climate change was the main driver of the rising crop water consumption; land use changes towards less water-intensive cropping practices offset only 3% of this increase. Our findings underscore that crop production will become increasingly challenging amidst accelerating climatic changes and that changing cropping practices alone will be insufficient to curb the growing water scarcity without a global commitment to reducing emissions.

 Global aridification threatens dryland ecosystems biodiversity and stability, yet the influence of multidimensional biodiversity on stability across aridity gradients is complex and context-dependent. Here we analyze plant and soil microbial diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional) across a 3,000-kilometer aridity gradient on the Mongolian Plateau and use multi-year observations from two validation sites. We identify a critical aridity threshold (Aridity ≈ 0.83) where stability mechanisms abruptly shift. Below this threshold (less arid conditions), ecosystem stability is positively linked to plant and fungal taxonomic richness. Above it (more arid conditions), stability correlates with conservative plant traits (lower special leaf area) and lower phylogenetic diversity, reflecting environmental filtering for stress-tolerant species. This transition is driven by a shift from C3 to C4 plant dominance, altering community traits and plant-microbial interactions. While our correlational findings require experimental confirmation, they challenge linear stability models, highlighting the importance of threshold-dependent biodiversity-environment interactions for dryland management. Ecosystem stability shifts at an aridity threshold where in less arid conditions it is linked to plant and fungal richness and in more arid conditions it depends on conservative plant traits and lower phylogenetic diversity, based on sampling across a 3000-km Mongolian Plateau gradient."

 Human activities substantially reduce net ecosystem productivity (NEP) globally, yet debates remain over the contributions of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC), such as afforestation (afforestation and reforestation), versus non-LUCC ecosystem management (EM; e.g., forest tending, mountain forest restoration, and fire control). Here, we developed an analytical framework by harmonizing structurally consistent remote sensing-driven and climate-driven ecological process models to quantify the dynamic effects of LUCC and eight EM types on NEP from 2001 to 2021 in China by isolating anthropogenic effects from global change factors. We found that the NEP, which averaged 327 Tg C yr–1 across the 9.6×106 km2 country, increased at a rate of 16.1 Tg C yr–2. Forest management, including forest tending (5.53 Tg C yr–2) and mountain forest restoration (2.7 Tg C yr–2), primarily drove carbon sink increases. Although afforestation induced greater NEP growth per unit area, the total effect of forest management—due to its much greater coverage—was 4.14 times greater than that of afforestation (1.6 Tg C yr–2). Notably, the acceleration of China’s NEP after 2010 was closely associated with intensified forest management efforts. Moreover, the rate of NEP gains caused by forest tending investment (8.54 kg C yr–2 $–1) was much greater than that caused by afforestation investment (0.25 kg C yr–2 $–1). Our findings highlight the critical role of forest management in cost-effectively enhancing the carbon sink. This has important implications for global forest management strategies and achieving net-zero emissions.

 Distributed Acoustic Sensing provides a transformative view of seismic wavefields, offering spatially continuous recordings that enable tracking of seismic phases along fibre optic cables. Offshore, fibres often cross sedimentary layers that generate phase conversions dominating early waveforms, increasing signal complexity and hindering rapid magnitude estimation for Earthquake Early Warning. Here, we analyse the peak amplitudes of seismic signals in a wide magnitude range (2.5≤ M ≤7.4), recorded by three interrogators along a 400km-long fibre array offshore Chile. We show that the direct P-phase is quickly dominated by secondary phases, limiting its use for source size estimation of moderate-to-large earthquakes. Conversely, we report that converted P-to-S waves carry a signature of the source similar to that of the S-phase within a few seconds from the first arrivals, offering a valuable proxy for rapid magnitude estimation. This finding reinforces the potential of Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Early Warning when sensing offshore cables.

 Compound floods resulting from the concurrence of river overflow and elevated sea levels are becoming increasingly unpredictable as climate extremes intensify. However, most flood risk assessments still fail to account for the uncertainty in their co-occurrence. Here, we quantify potential coastal compound flood risk at 0.1∘ resolution by integrating flood hazard, population exposure, and empirical vulnerability. Specifically, we introduce a compound flood metric, which aggregates riverine and oceanic flood volumes across multiple return periods under a physically plausible co-occurrence assumption. We further derive an empirical vulnerability function based on the ratio between observed and maximum potential flood hazard. The results show that Asia exhibites the highest 35.22% internal high-risk grids, followed by Africa (20.21%), Europe (17.02%), South America (9.89%), and North America (2.31%), with river deltas and low-lying coasts emerging as global riskhotspots.

 Understanding volcanic dynamics and assessing eruptive risk require examining the entire transcrustal magmatic system. However, direct imaging of magma distribution and connectivity from the Moho to the surface remains rare. Changbaishan-Tianchi volcano, known for one of the Earth’s largest explosive eruptions, has recently undergone repeated magmatic unrest. To investigate the magmatic system beneath Tianchi volcano, we invert magnetotelluric data to image its three-dimensional resistivity structure, revealing a vertically extensive low-resistivity anomaly system spanning the entire crust. This system comprises three compositionally distinct, vertically connected melt reservoirs: a broad lower-crustal basaltic reservoir (20–35 km), an upper-crustal trachytic reservoir (5–10 km), and an uppermost comenditic reservoir (2–3.5 km). Estimated melt fractions are 2.1–3.7%, 7.0–16.3%, and 18.8–23.8%, respectively. Our results suggest progressive upward magma transfer among these reservoirs via well-resolved conductive pathways, consistent with recent episodes of unrest. Notably, melt volume in the lower crust is about one to two orders of magnitude greater than in the upper crust, a pattern also observed at Yellowstone and likely applicable to active volcanic systems at both divergent and convergent plate boundaries. These findings suggest that deep crustal hot zones may fundamentally control shallow melt volumes and thus the eruptive capacity of polygenetic volcanoes.

The dataset included 1,123 effect sizes from 167 independent samples spanning three decades, 30 countries, and 110,683 individuals facing hazards such as heatwaves and earthquakes. Results identified four key factors of public (un)preparedness: (1) social norms regarding preparedness, (2) efficacy beliefs and attitudes toward specific preparedness actions, preliminary – (3) information dissemination sources, and (4) barriers to preparedness. Notably, the effects considerably varied across studies. For researchers, we recommend refined conceptualizations and measurements of preparedness and focus on heat-related hazards. For practitioners, this synthesis provides insights to improve risk communication, inform policy decisions, and build resilient communities.

 Desertification is a global ecological and environmental problem, dynamic monitoring and accurate assessment of desertification are essential for restoring regional ecology and achieving sustainable development. Current desertification monitoring methods face dual challenges including unclear remote sensing mechanisms, non-robust extraction methods and the absence of high-resolution large-scale desertification products. This study constructs a comprehensive desertification index (CDI) by integrating multisource remote sensing data (Sentinel-1/2), incorporating three features —phenomenal indices (vegetation cover), cause indices (soil moisture) and essence indices (soil roughness)—on the basis of the multidimensional driving mechanisms of desertification physical processes. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was then applied to the CDI to automate desertification mapping for yielding the first 10 m-resolution annual desertification dataset in northern China (NCDMD, 2016–2024). The results demonstrated that the CDI-GMM based method achieves superior performance in mapping desertification scope across northern China in 2019, with an overall accuracy of 93.5 % and an overall accuracy of 86.4 % for desertification degree according to field survey data. In comparison, traditional approaches showed significantly lower accuracy, with the pixel dichotomy model (FVC-based) achieving 82.2 % in scope extraction and 50.3 % in degree classification, while the DDI feature space method reached 86.1 % and 64.2 %, respectively. Comparative experiments with five unsupervised classification methods (GMM, K-Means, MiniBatch K-Means, Jenks natural breaks, and Weka LVQ algorithms) indicated that the CDI combined with the GMM clustering algorithm can optimize the extraction of desertification and maintain stable performance, with an overall classification accuracy of over 93 %.

 The successful deployment of multiple satellites equipped with passive microwave sensors has been pivotal for monitoring global soil moisture. Despite their importance, limitations including varying service durations, orbital scanning gaps, and differences in retrieval algorithms result in poor spatio-temporal consistency and coverage. This study introduces a two-stage paradigm to overcome the inconsistency of multi-sensors: Firstly, high-precision soil moisture is generated from SMAP L-band observations through the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA) as the physically anchored training target. Then, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network specifically designed for global gridded soil moisture dynamics is trained based on cross-calibrated brightness temperature observations (inclined orbit satellite sensors (TMI and GMI) and polar orbit satellite sensors (AMSR-E and AMSR2)) to obtain the high-quality retrieval accuracy of MCCA SMAP. Finally, the daily global soil moisture product (25 km resolution, 1997–2023) is provided by fusing the instantaneous soil moisture data of the four sensors from the model output. The study performed extensive validation with ground measurements and cross-validation with other datasets for both temporal and spatial consistency. The results indicate that the spatial distribution and seasonal variation patterns of MCCA-ML closely match those of MCCA SMAP, reflecting global climatic and geographic features. Verified by 24 dense global observation networks, the global r value of MCCA-ML SM is 0.76, the RMSE is 0.068 m3/m3, and the ubRMSE is 0.059 m3/m3, which well inherits the excellent performance of SMAP. During the service period of two or more satellites, the daily global land coverage of MCCA-ML SM usually exceeds 80 %, and it has a good ability to detect soil moisture."

 Soil moisture (SM), with its strong water absorption characteristics, profoundly alters the soil reflectance spectra and reduces the reliability of predicting other soil parameters. To achieve high-precision spectral simulation and remove SM effects efficiently, we propose a novel method based the optimized four-flux Maheu-Letoulouzan-Gouesbet (MLG) radiative transfer model. The model incorporates key soil properties (e.g., SM, organic matter, iron oxides, texture fractions) to better characterize soil spectral formation mechanisms. Additionally, the genetic algorithm, with a spectral continuity constraint, is developed for global parameter optimization, thereby simplifying the calculation process and improving the simulation reliability. Based on the optimal parameters, the SM factor is independently excluded and then the spectra are reconstructed to remove SM effects. Results demonstrated that the optimized MLG model achieved the highest accuracy in soil spectral simulation under both dry and wet conditions. Compared with the Kubelka-Munk (KM) model, the coefficient of determination (R2) improved from 0.87 to 0.94 in the ICRAF dry soil dataset and from 0.87 to 0.94 in the Nong'an wet soil dataset. The model maintained high accuracy (R2 = 0.81) even when the SM content exceeded 30 %, with strong effects in the water absorption bands around 1400 and 1900 nm. After removing SM effects from in-situ field spectra, corrected spectra exhibited stronger correlations with organic matter, iron oxides, and texture fractions, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy (R2 > 0.90, the relative percent difference (RPD) increase by 0.88–3.00). This physically-grounded method underscores the potential for accurate soil spectral simulation and SM effects removal, thereby strengthening the foundation for large-scale soil monitoring via satellite remote sensing."

 Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) are nature-based solutions critical for mitigating climate change and biodiversity loss. Accurate mapping of BCEs is fundamental to carbon accounting, maximizing their ecosystem service value, and informing conservation and restoration efforts. Yet, most existing studies focus on single ecosystem mapping and lack multi-class classification approaches capable of addressing the spectral similarity among different BCEs. To address this issue, we developed a novel algorithm on Google Earth Engine, namely Multi-class Blue Carbon Ecosystem Mapping by integrating Tide-level, Phenological, and Biophysical features (MBCEM-TPB) to simultaneously map mangroves, saltmarshes, and intertidal seagrass meadows, thereby characterizing the full composition of BCEs. Specifically, we first composited multi-temporal imagery under different tidal levels, phenological stages, and biophysical features from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Based on spectral similarity principles, we performed training sample migration and then generated interannual blue carbon maps for 2019, 2021, and 2023 using Random Forest classifier. The algorithm was evaluated across eight study sites encompassing different BCEs combinations (two or three ecosystem types) spanning diverse climate zones, bioregions, and levels of ecosystem complexity. The overall accuracy of the MBCEM-TPB algorithm exceeded 93.65% across three periods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability, even in complex intertidal landscapes. This study provides the first unified multi-class classification algorithm for BCEs and offers a generalizable approach applicable at global scales, supporting refined blue carbon accounting and ecosystem management."

 The spectrum is a key physical quantity characterizing the urban nighttime light environment. However, due to the prevalent use of single-band observations in conventional nighttime light remote sensing, studies on urban nighttime spectral characteristics remain relatively weak. With the advancement of multispectral remote sensing, band-wise spectral retrieval has become feasible. In this study, based on SDGSAT-1 nighttime multispectral imagery and ground-based measurements, we compare the spectral ranges of human visual perception and satellite sensors, retrieve the urban nighttime RGB-band spectral distribution, and construct a light-environment inversion map and a blue-light ratio map. The results show that: (1) configuring bands with reference to the human visual spectral range is more suitable for remote sensing spectral retrieval, among which the B band exhibits the highest correlation with ground observations (correlation coefficient 0.879), followed by the R and G bands (0.700 and 0.688, respectively). (2) A comparison of six linear regression models with three machine learning models—random forest, back-propagation (BP) neural network, and support vector regression—indicates that machine learning models overall outperform linear models, while the three machine learning approaches achieve comparable accuracies, with cross-validated R2 values of approximately 0.65–0.70. (3) Considering residual characteristics and uncertainty analysis, the random forest model is selected as the primary inversion model to retrieve the nighttime spectra of the main urban area of Dalian. The band-wise and blue-light ratio maps reveal the spatial patterns of high-luminance functional areas such as traffic corridors, commercial districts, and landscape lighting, demonstrating that multispectral nighttime light remote sensing can provide important support for urban lighting planning and sustainable urban development."

 Existing deep learning methods for ecological monitoring using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery primarily rely on coherency (T) or covariance (C) matrices derived from the linear polarization basis, often overlooking scattering information inherent in alternative polarization representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel classification framework that explicitly incorporates a circular polarization basis into the PolSAR deep learning workflow. A circular coherency matrix (Cir), analogous to the conventional T matrix, was first derived through polarization basis transformation. Subsequently, a multi-basis input scheme was introduced to fuse linear and circular polarization features to enhance feature representation and information utilization. The proposed framework was validated on two benchmark datasets using multiple deep learning models, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 97.70% and 98.58%.Compared with standard linear-basis approaches, the proposed scheme yielded accuracy improvements of 2.86% over the T-matrix-based method and 2.26% over the C-matrix-based method. In addition, the incorporation of circular polarization features significantly enhanced physical interpretability, particularly for structurally complex targets such as forests and buildings. Overall, the findings provide an effective technical pathway for intelligent land cover classification and broader ecological monitoring.

 3D navigation, by virtue of its realism, provides rich, authentic, and visually immersive information that closely approximates the physical world, playing a crucial role in domains such as commerce and scientific research. However, current 3D navigation systems face challenges including the separation of multi-view information and the occlusion of navigation routes. This paper presents an occlusion-free, multi-perspective visualization method for urban navigation routes. We introduce an undulating curve surface and, through computation of an information detail metric, demonstrate that our surface enables rapid transitions from the focus to the context and supports visualization of much larger scene extents within the same screen space, compared to a monotonic cylindrical surface. We further enhance scene information delivery by segmenting the navigation route and adjusting the camera’s tilt angle and field of view to match different surface parameters. To eliminate occlusion of the navigation route, we adjust the position and scale of obstructing buildings, assigning distance-based weights. Compared to the fixed-weight approach, our distance-weighted approach highlights building position and shape features more effectively across varied scenarios. The proposed method is validated using an experimental scenario in a region of Barcelona. Experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively represent scenes at different scales while prominently displaying the navigation route, thereby enhancing the overall navigation experience."

 Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating associated risks. Existing point cloud-based methods, however, typically rely on either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical partitioning-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. Patch-level matches are constructed using both 3D geometry and 2D image features, refined via geometric consistency checks, and followed by rigid transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world landslide datasets demonstrate that the proposed method produces 3D displacement estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and accuracy. Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements (total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets, respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived references, all below the mean scan resolutions (0.08 m and 0.30 m). Compared with the state-of-the-art method F2S3, the proposed approach improves spatial coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. The proposed approach offers a practical and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks."

 The accurate detection of active landslides influenced by reservoir water-level fluctuations is critically important for safeguarding hydropower infrastructure and protecting lives and property along riverbanks. However, most current InSAR-based approaches primarily rely on abrupt changes in phase or velocity gradients, while largely ignoring the causative environmental conditions that control landslide initiation. This study proposes a novel method for causative environment-informed active landslide detection with InSAR monitoring in the reservoir area. First, a four-directional velocity gradient matrix is constructed from time-series deformation data. Spatial morphology analysis is then used to filter out noise, extracting active deformation areas (ADAs) with continuous boundaries. Subsequently, five slope unit-based landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) models are constructed to learn the causative environmental conditions of reservoir landslides systematically. Finally, an area under the curve (AUC) weighted voting strategy is employed to integrate deformation signals with environmental constraints, enabling the reliable identification of active landslides. Applied to the DHQ and HD reservoir areas of the Lancang River basin, the method identified 89 ADAs, achieving a 96% spatial overlap with manually interpreted deformation areas. Under the constraints of causative environmental factors, the overall F1-Score for identifying active landslides in the reservoir area reached 78.15%. Model interpretability analysis revealed that distance to river (DtR) plays a dominant role in both the formation and detection of reservoir landslides. The study further identifies key landslide-causing environment factors (LEFs) and high-susceptibility areas, providing valuable data support and decision-making guidance for reservoir slope disaster management, landslide monitoring, early warning, and risk prevention."

 Through k-means clustering analysis, this study identified three dominant anomalous patterns of autumn rainfall over West China: (1) a region-wide positive anomalies in precipitation, (2) a south-positive–north-negative dipole pattern, and (3) a west-positive–east-negative dipole pattern. The first two patterns account for most of the explained variance annually. The first pattern is influenced primarily by a strengthened and westward-extended western Pacific subtropical high and an intensified East Asian subtropical jet (EAJ), driven mainly by negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical central-eastern Pacific. Reduced snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau also plays a moderating role by altering the thermal forcing that affects the EAJ. The second pattern is associated mainly with an anomalous anticyclone over the South China Sea and a weakened, southward-shifted EAJ, which are closely linked to El Niño-like SST anomalies in the tropical central-eastern Pacific and cold SST anomalies in the eastern North Atlantic.

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), the primary anthropogenic greenhouse gas, is a critical tracer for understanding carbon-cycle–climate feedback. Despite intense industrialization and population density, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) lacks high-frequency in situ CO₂ observations in its coastal and marine-influenced zones. In this study, the continuous atmospheric CO₂ measurements collected between December 2020 and December 2022 at an urban tower in Shanghai and a coastal background site in Shengsi were analyzed. Results reveal a distinct bimodal diurnal cycle in Shanghai, primarily driven by local anthropogenic emissions, whereas Shengsi exhibits a unimodal pattern more closely coupled to biospheric processes and marine dilution. Nighttime data from Shanghai station reliably represents urban background concentrations, as the stable concentration performance, less planetary boundary layer (PBL) and anthropogenic impacts. Wind and trajectory analyses link CO₂ enhancement at Shanghai to emissions from northern and northwestern sectors, whereas Shengsi concentrations are modulated by ocean-atmosphere carbon exchange—as evidenced by correlations with sea surface temperature, salinity, and pressure, alongside stronger negative links to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and air temperature compared to Shanghai. Furthermore, partial least squares regression (PLSR) further highlights the dominance of local emissions at Shanghai (< 200 km scale) and oceanic/biospheric drivers at Shengsi, with regional transport amplifying variability across scales.

James,Mapping somatosensory afferent circuitry to bone identifies neurotrophic signals required for fracture healing,"The pain associated with bone fracture is mediated by somatosensory neurons, which also appear to be required to initiate bone regeneration. To characterize neuroanatomical circuitry mediating skeletal nociception and regeneration, we profiled dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons innervating murine bones using single-cell transcriptomics before and after fracture. CGRP+and Aβ-Field LTMR neurons were the most represented classes of bone-innervating neurons. Dynamic changes in sensory neuron response to injury reflected the phasic nature of bone repair, including expression of morphogens such asTgfb1,Fgf9, andShh. Innervation loss resulted in poor bone repair and was associated with defective mesenchymal cell proliferation and osteodifferentiation. Finally, we identified fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) as a major regulator of fracture repair that could be leveraged to promote bone repair."

In wet-lab validations, DrugCLIP achieved a 15% hit rate for norepinephrine transporter, and structures of two identified inhibitors were determined in complex with the target protein. For thyroid hormone receptor interactor 12, a target that lacks holo structures and small-molecule binders, DrugCLIP achieved a 17.5% hit rate using only AlphaFold2-predicted structures.

For isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)–mutant gliomas, the most common malignant primary brain tumor in young adults, the cell of origin is currently poorly understood. We conducted deep sequencing on 142 tissues from 70 individuals comprising tumors, peritumoral cortex or subventricular zones, and blood. Low-levelIDHmutations were found in the peritumoral cortex in 37.9% (11 of 29) of patients. Integrating cell-type–specific mutation analysis, the direction of clonal evolution, spatial transcriptomics from patient brains, and a cancer mouse model arising from mutant oligodendrocyte progenitor cell, we determined that glial progenitor cells harboring an initialIDHmutation were responsible for the development of IDH-mutant gliomas."

Here we reveal, through gene-centric and genome-resolved metagenomics, that the bark of eight common Australian tree species hosts abundant and specialized microbial communities. The predominant bacteria are hydrogen-cycling facultative anaerobes adapted to dynamic redox and substrate conditions. Furthermore, bark-associated methanotrophs are abundant and can coexist with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Microcosm experiments showed that bark microorganisms aerobically consume methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide at in planta concentrations and produce these gases under anoxia. Combined with in situ field measurements, we show that tree-dwelling microbiota metabolize multiple climate-active gases at marked rates within tree stems, highlighting a potentially substantial role in global atmospheric cycles."

Here, we report a class of pericyclic reactions, called triatropic rearrangements, wherein three σ-bonds are broken concomitantly with the formation of two σ-bonds and one π-bond, all in a single transition state. Within this mechanistic manifold, carbon-oxygen bonds in epoxides are stereoselectively converted into carbon-carbon bonds in a process mediated by organoboron reagents. Epoxycycloalkanes undergo highly chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective carbon migration to furnish ring-contracted products with broad generality. This strategy also enables enantioselective 1,2-hydride migrations for linear epoxide substrates. The combination of this ring contraction protocol with [4+2] cycloadditions provides a distinct “[4+2–1]” strategy for the stereoselective construction of complex cyclopentanes in a modular fashion."

An outstanding question is how this organization emerges during development from an apparently homogeneous pool of neural progenitors. Here, we show that mouse dorsal neurons are diversified by time, with families of related cell types born as temporal cohorts, and by a spatial-molecular gradient that specifies individual cell types. Excitatory neurons settle into a chronotopic arrangement that transforms their progressive birthdates into anatomical order and is required to establish proper laminae. We identified essential ontogenetic principles that shape dorsal progenitors into the diverse cell types and structure that subserve sensorimotor function."

Here, we introduce a controllable one- to two-dimensional (1D-to-2D) structural transition strategy by systematically tuning ligand conformation, thereby modulating hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, and basicity to elucidate the relationship between molecular structure, interfacial interactions, and resulting dimensionality. The 1D-amidinium perovskite structure, with its pronounced geometric anisotropy, impedes uniform surface coverage and defect passivation. In contrast, the 2D-amidinium perovskite forms a continuous, homogeneous interfacial layer, enabling more effective defect passivation and favorable energy-level alignment. With dimensionality control, inverted 3D/2D-amidinium perovskite solar cells deliver 25.4% power conversion efficiency (1.1 square centimeters, steady-state certified) and maintain >95% of their initial efficiency after 1100 hours of continuous 1-sun operation at 85°C."

Real-time healing of iodine vacancies occurred during annealing and the lead-iodine framework was stabilized through optimized ligand engineering, resulting in enhanced structural integrity and long-term stability of perovskite films. This strategy enabled n-i-p perovskite solar cells to achieve a PCE of 26.6% (certified 26.5%).

Comparative studies with NodD1 ofSinorhizobium medicae, the symbiont ofMedicago truncatula, revealed that this specificity is determined by the shape of the pocket and by specific amino acids. A chimeric NodD containing the flavonoid recognition residues fromS. medicaeNodD1 in theR. leguminosarumNodD backbone was sufficient to complement nitrogen fixation inM. truncatulaby anS. medicae nodD1mutant, confirming the critical role of flavonoid recognition in host range."

CIMA established an enhancer-driven gene regulatory network comprising 237 robust regulons; identified 9600 eGenes and 52,361 caPeaks at cell type resolution; and revealed pleiotropic associations among immune-related disease risk loci, cis-expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and chromatin accessibility QTLs.

Demonstrating similar learning processes in nonhuman species would indicate that the social-cognitive skills supporting this process are not exclusively human but may have evolved, or can develop, in other species, offering valuable insights into the origins of language-related cognition. In this study, we demonstrated that a small group of Gifted Word Learner dogs, which possess an extensive vocabulary of object labels, can learn new labels by overhearing their owners’ interactions. Moreover, we show that these dogs can acquire novel object-label mappings even when the labels and objects are not presented simultaneously.

Termed Floquet engineering, such periodic driving applied to electronic systems can induce topological band structures and control spin interactions. In this study, we present a class of Floquet states in a magnetic vortex that arise from nonlinear interactions between the vortex core and microwave magnons. Floquet bands emerge through the periodic oscillation of the core, which can be initiated by either driving the core directly or pumping azimuthal magnon modes. For the latter, the azimuthal modes induce core gyration through nonlinear interactions, which in turn renormalizes the magnon band structure. This represents a self-induced mechanism for Floquet band engineering and opens avenues to study and control nonlinear magnon dynamics."

Anatomy shows that facial muscles are under direct control from multiple cortical regions, and studies of patients with focal lesions suggest that lateral frontal cortices control voluntary movements and medial emotional expressions. By directly measuring single-neuron activity from both sets of areas, we found that lateral and medial cortical face motor regions encode both types of gestures. They do so through area-specific temporal activity patterns, distinguishable well prior to movement onset. Our results show that cortical regions projecting in parallel downstream form a continuum of gesture coding, from dynamic to temporally stable, to produce socially appropriate motor outputs during communication."

We identified genes encoding a predicted nuclease paired with a trypsin-like protease repeatedly acquired by multiple, otherwise unrelated antiviral immune systems in bacteria. Cell-based and biochemical assays revealed that the nuclease is a proenzyme that cleaves DNA only after activation by its partner protease. Two distinct immune systems, Hachiman and AVAST (antiviral adenosine triphosphatase/nucleoside triphosphatase of the STAND superfamily, Avs), use the same mechanism of proteolytic activation despite their independent evolutionary origins. Examination of nuclease-protease inheritance patterns identified caspase-nuclease (canu) genomic loci that confer antiviral defense in a pathway reminiscent of eukaryotic caspase activation. These results uncover the coordinated activities of pronucleases and their activating proteases within different immune systems and show how coevolution enables defense system innovation."

To investigate multispecies mixtures as an alternative strategy, the 26-site international LegacyNet experiment systematically varied the diversity of sown grasslands using up to six high-yielding forage species (grasses, legumes, and herbs) managed under moderate nitrogen inputs. Multispecies mixtures outyielded two widely used grassland practices: a grass monoculture with higher nitrogen fertilizer and a two-species grass-legume community. High yields in multispecies mixtures were driven by strong positive grass-legume and legume-herb interactions. In warmer sites, the yield advantage of legume-containing multispecies mixtures over grass monocultures with higher nitrogen fertilizer inputs increased. Improved design of grassland mixtures can inform more environmentally sustainable forage production and may enhance adaptation of productive grasslands to a warming climate."

Experiments are often guided by a prediction of a distinct and self-explanatory signal called “the smoking gun.” However, in micrometer- or nanometer-scale specimens, phenomenology can mimic the anticipated behavior without containing the exotic states. We show limited data that are consistent with the presence of four topological phenomena; by considering additional data, we identified the most likely origins of the observed patterns as trivial. We argue that the reliability of smoking gun–type claims can be greatly enhanced by releasing comprehensive datasets, discussing alternative scenarios, and disclosing the total volume of study."
