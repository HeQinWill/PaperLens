10.5194/acp-25-3889-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究探讨了北极地区吸湿性气溶胶（如海盐）对长波向下辐射的影响。研究发现，这些气溶胶会吸收水分而增大，从而显著增强其在红外区域的吸热效应，尤其是在冬季。研究使用傅里叶变换光谱仪测量气溶胶成分。结果表明，湿气溶胶的红外辐射效应远大于干燥气溶胶，并且与北极地区的温度异常相关联。这项研究强调了理解气溶胶对于预测气候变化的重要性，并暗示了气溶胶可能通过正反馈机制加剧北极变暖。,"['aerosol composition', 'longwave downward radiation', 'sea salt aerosols', 'hygroscopic aerosols', 'Fourier transform spectrometer', 'Arctic warming', 'air quality monitoring (implication)', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Denghui Ji;Mathias Palm;Matthias Buschmann;Kerstin Ebell;Marion Maturilli;Xiaoyu Sun;Justus Notholt,Hygroscopic aerosols amplify longwave downward radiation in the Arctic,"Our study explores how certain aerosols, like sea salt, affect infrared heat radiation in the Arctic, potentially speeding up warming. We used advanced technology to measure aerosol composition and found that these particles grow with humidity, significantly increasing their heat-trapping effect in the infrared region, especially in winter. Our findings suggest these aerosols could be a key factor in Arctic warming, emphasizing the importance of understanding aerosols for climate prediction. 
 This study investigates the impact of hygroscopic aerosols, such as sea salt and sulfate, on longwave downward radiation in the Arctic. These aerosols absorb atmospheric water vapor, leading to wet growth, increased size, and enhanced longwave downward radiation emission, defined as the aerosol infrared radiation effect. Observations of aerosols, especially their composition, are challenging during the Arctic winter. We use an emission Fourier transform spectrometer to measure aerosol composition. Observations show that the aerosol infrared radiation effect of dry aerosols is limited to about 1.45±2.00 W m−2. Wet growth significantly increases this effect. During winter, at relative humidity levels between 60 % and 80 %, wet aerosols exhibit effects approximately 7 times greater than dry aerosols. When relative humidity exceeds 80 %, the effect can be up to 20 times higher. Sea salt aerosols in Ny-Ålesund demonstrate high effect values, while non-hygroscopic aerosols like black carbon and dust show consistently low values. Reanalysis data indicate increased water vapor and sea salt aerosol optical depth in Ny-Ålesund after 2000, correlating with significant positive temperature anomalies in this area. Moreover, wet aerosols can remain activated even in dry environments, continuously contributing high effects, thereby expanding the area affected by aerosol-induced warming. This warming effect may exacerbate Arctic warming, acting as a positive feedback mechanism."
10.5194/acp-25-3905-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文通过在中国上海进行的现场观测和模型模拟，探讨了有机硝酸盐对夏季臭氧形成的影响。论文重点关注了烷基硝酸盐（ANs）和过氧硝酸盐（PNs）的浓度及其对臭氧生成的影响，并使用TD-CEAS技术进行了测量。研究结果表明，PNs的产生在一定程度上抑制了臭氧的生成，并且ANs的产率会影响臭氧对前体物的响应。这项研究对于理解有机硝酸盐的化学性质以及制定有效的本地臭氧控制策略具有重要意义，与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['organic nitrates', 'ozone production', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'TD-CEAS', 'VOCs']",Chunmeng Li;Xiaorui Chen;Haichao Wang;Tianyu Zhai;Xuefei Ma;Xinping Yang;Shiyi Chen;Min Zhou;Shengrong Lou;Xin Li;Limin Zeng;Keding Lu,"The impact of organic nitrates on summer ozone formation in Shanghai, China","This study reports an observation of organic nitrate (including total peroxy nitrates and total alkyl nitrates) in Shanghai, China, during the summer of 2021, by homemade thermal dissociation cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (TD-CEAS; Atmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 4033–4051, 2021). The distribution of organic nitrates and their effects on local ozone production are analyzed based on field observations in conjunction with model simulations. 
 Organic nitrates serve as important secondary oxidation products in the atmosphere, playing a crucial role in the atmospheric radical cycles and influencing the production of secondary pollutants (ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols). However, field measurements of organic nitrates are scarce in China, and a comprehensive localized mechanism for organic nitrates is absent, hindering effective pollution mitigation strategies. In this study, we conducted measurements of ambient gaseous organic nitrates and examined their effects on local O3 production at a polluted urban site in eastern China during summer. The average daytime concentrations of alkyl nitrates (ANs) and peroxy nitrates (PNs) throughout the campaign were 0.5 ± 0.3 and 0.9 ± 0.7 ppbv, respectively, with peaks reaching up to 1.6 and 3.6 ppbv. An observation-constrained box model, incorporating an updated mechanism for organic nitrates, was employed to assess the environmental impact of these compounds. The model results indicated that PN production inhibited the daytime O3 production by 16 % (0.8 ppbv h−1), which is relatively low compared to previous studies. Furthermore, scenario analyses revealed that production yields (α) of ANs would alter the response of O3 formation to precursors due to varying compositions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Our results suggest that blind pollution control may cause ineffective pollution prevention and highlight the necessity of a thorough understanding of organic nitrate chemistry for local O3 control strategy."

However, global LIA knowledge is still lacking. This study generated the first global 500 m LIA products by gap-filling LIA measurement data. The global LIA is 41.47° ± 9.55° and increases with latitude. LIA products could enhance our understanding of global LIA and assist remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies. 
 Leaf inclination angle (LIA), the angle between the leaf surface normal and zenith directions, is a vital trait in radiative transfer, rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and hydrological processes. Due to the difficulty of obtaining large-scale field measurement data, LIA is typically assumed to follow the spherical leaf distribution or simply considered to be constant for different plant types. However, the appropriateness of these simplifications and the global LIA distribution are still unknown. This study compiled global LIA measurements and generated the first global 500 m mean LIA (MLA) product by gap-filling the LIA measurement data using a random forest regressor. Different generation strategies were employed for noncrops and crops. The MLA product was evaluated by validating the nadir leaf projection function (G(0)) derived from the MLA product with high-resolution reference data. The global MLA is 41.47°±9.55°, and the value increases with latitude. The MLAs for different vegetation types follow the order of cereal crops (54.65°) > broadleaf crops (52.35°) > deciduous needleleaf forest (50.05°) > shrubland (49.23°) > evergreen needleleaf forest (47.13°) ≈ grassland (47.12°) > deciduous broadleaf forest (41.23°) > evergreen broadleaf forest (34.40°). Cross-validation shows that the predicted MLA presents a medium consistency (r=0.75, RMSE = 7.15°) with the validation samples for noncrops, whereas crops show relatively lower correspondence (r=0.48 and 0.60 for broadleaf crops and cereal crops, respectively) because of the limited LIA measurements and strong seasonality. The global mean G(0) is 0.68±0.11. The global G(0) distribution is out of phase with that of the MLA and agrees moderately with the reference data (r=0.62, RMSE = 0.15). This study shows that the common spherical and constant LIA assumptions may underestimate the interception of most vegetation types. The MLA and G(0) products derived in this study could enhance our knowledge of global LIA and should greatly facilitate remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies.The global MLA and G(0) products can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12739662 (Li and Fang, 2025)."

Our dataset will provide new insights for monitoring the diurnal variations of carbon and water cycles and deepen our understanding of their changes over the past 40 years. 
 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and evapotranspiration (ET) have been widely recognized as proxies for carbon gain and water loss at the ecosystem level. However, most SIF and ET products on the global scale are generally at coarse temporal resolutions of at least one day, which limits their ability to characterize diurnal carbon and water cycles. In this study, we extended the spatiotemporal scale of satellite SIF (from OCO-2 and OCO-3) and ET (from ECOSTRESS) data using machine learning methods, resulting in a global hourly SIF and ET dataset (HOUR_SIFOCO and HOUR_ETECO) spanning from 1982 to 2022, with a spatial resolution of 0.1°. Our product also provides photosystem-level SIF derived from direct estimation and simulation of Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, aiming to offer a more accurate description of photosynthesis. Our satellite-derived products show good correlations with in-situ flux tower measurements from the FLUXNET2015 community (hourly-scale median R2 for SIF: 0.72, and ET: 0.53; daily-scale median R2 for SIF: 0.73, and ET: 0.63). Globally, our product shows good consistency with popular SIF and ET gridded products: the mean proportions of pixels with monthly R2 exceeding 0.7 are 69.5 % and 68.1 % when compared with four popular products, respectively. The causal-based attribution analysis revealed significant spatial heterogeneity in the lagged effects of different environmental factors on SIF, ET, and water use efficiency based on SIF and ET on the global scale. Overall, our dataset will provide new insights for monitoring the diurnal variations of carbon and water cycles and deepen our understanding of their changes over the past 40 years.

CLIMADAT-GRid serves as a valuable resource for research and information in climate studies as well as in other areas such as hydrology, agriculture, energy and health. 
 We introduce the development of CLIMADAT-GRid, the first publicly available daily air temperature and precipitation gridded climate dataset for Greece at a high resolution of 1 km x 1 km, covering the period 1981–2019. The dataset is derived from quality-controlled and homogenized daily measurements from an extensive network of meteorological stations: 122 for temperature and 312 for precipitation. Several approaches are evaluated for generating the daily gridded datasets, and their accuracy is assessed against withheld observational data. To address the lack of observations in high-elevation areas, high-resolution simulations from the WRF model are blended with the observational data to provide the gridded temperature data. CLIMADAT-GRid is benchmarked against the CHELSA-W5E5, a global climate product with a similar resolution, for the overlapping period 1981–2016. While both datasets show comparable results for temperature, CLIMADAT-GRid demonstrates superior spatial variability and closer agreement with observational data for both the mean and for the extreme values. Regarding precipitation, CLIMADAT-GRid consistency indicates higher values than CHELSA, especially during the rainy season, but exhibits better agreement with observations. In terms of the number of wet days, both datasets overestimate spatial means relative to observations, with CLIMADAT-GRid showing a more pronounced orographic pattern than CHELSA. Both datasets show similar results for the number of days with precipitation amounts equal to or higher than 10 mm, with CLIMADAT-GRid indicating better overall agreement with the observations.

This record providing detailed FT information, enhancing the understanding of hydrological and ecological impacts globally. 
 The global near-surface soil freeze-thaw (FT) states are crucial for understanding complex interactions with hydrological, ecological, and climatic processes. However, current remote sensing of FT states primarily relies on passive microwave remote sensing, which, despite its all-weather monitoring capabilities, suffers from low spatial resolution. This limitation restricts its application to hydroclimatological scales, precluding its use in finer-scale studies such as soil erosion and hydrometeorological applications. To address this, this study introduces a novel downscaling approach that integrates passive microwave and optical satellite data to generate a long-term (2002–2023), high-resolution (0.05°) dataset of global near-surface FT states, ensuring daily seamless continuity. The dataset was validated against in situ measurements, demonstrating that the high-resolution product maintains an overall accuracy of 83.78 %, consistent with the coarse-resolution microwave-based dataset, while offering enhanced spatial detail. Comprehensive global trend analyses provided new insights into the dynamics of freeze-thaw cycles, revealing that the average annual number of frost days in regions north of 45° N is 187.8 ± 12.7 days, with 14.35 % of the area showing a decreasing trend in frozen persistence. Additionally, the average annual number of freeze onset dates is 240.3 ± 7.2, and 9.10 % of the area exhibits a trend of delayed freeze onset. The high-resolution record enables accurately monitoring FT states and providing detailed information, for a refined understanding of hydrological and ecological effects globally.

We use two independent TC tracking algorithms to detect information of all the TCs from NOAA’s Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CRv3). By doing so, the RGTracks-20C fills the gaps of incomplete TC track records (TC intensity) in the historical TC observation data (e.g., IBTrACS), addressing the limitations of early-year observed TC data. 
 Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the deadliest disasters affecting human society, and their response to climate change has widely drawn attention from the public. However, assessing how historical TC activity changed with climate change has proven challenging due to incomplete TC records in the early years. Here, we introduce the Reanalysis-Based Global Tropical Cyclone Tracks Dataset for the Twentieth Century (RGTracks-20C) (Ye et al., 2024), a publicly available century- long global TC track dataset spanning from 1850–2014. The RGTracks-20C is reconstructed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Twentieth Century Reanalysis using two independent TC tracking algorithms. Validation based on observations confirms that the RGTracks- 20C effectively captures the climatology and long-term variability of TC numbers, tracks, duration, and intensity across various ocean basins. A remarkable key strength of the RGTracks-20C is its ability to fill the missing intensity and location records of TCs observed in early years.

Our findings show Africa's cropland grew by 8.5 % over two decade, while 11.5 % of cropland was abandoned by 2018 – revealing hidden challenges in agricultural sustainability. These yearly, field-sized maps help governments track where farming grows or shrinks, plan food supplies, and protect vital cropland. 
 Accurate cropland mapping is essential for understanding agricultural dynamics in Africa, a critical global issue with significant implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., Zero Hunger). Large-scale cropland mapping encounters several challenges, including the varying landscape characteristics of cropland across different regions, extended cultivation periods, and the limited availability of reference data. The study developed a 30-meter resolution African annual cropland distribution (namely AFCD) dataset for Africa spanning the years 2000 to 2022. To extract this large-scale cropland distribution data, we employed random forest classification and Continuous Change Detection algorithms on the Google Earth Engine platform. Robust training samples were generated, and a locally adaptive model was applied for cropland extraction. The final output consists of annual binary Crop/Non-Crop maps from 2000 to 2022. Independent validation samples from numerous third-party sources confirm that the map’s accuracy is 0.86±0.01. A comparison of the cropland area estimates from AFCD with those of the FAO for Africa yielded an R-squared value of 0.86. According to our estimates, Africa’s cropland expanded from 194.35 Mha in 2000 to 210.92 Mha by 2022, marking a net increase of 8.53 %. Prior to 2005, changes in Africa’s cropland area were gradual, but after 2006, there was a marked acceleration in cropland expansion. Despite this continued growth, Africa also experienced significant cropland abandonment. By 2018, abandoned cropland accounted for 11.52 % of the total active cropland area. AFCD also avoided the misclassification of buildings, roads, and trees surrounding cropland, a common issue in LGRIP products. The study further highlights the unique advantage of AFCD in providing a dynamic annual cropland dataset at 30-meter resolution for Africa. This dataset is a crucial resource for understanding the spatial-temporal dynamics of cropland and can support policies on food security and sustainable land management.

Emmons;Vaishali Naik;Kostas Tsigaridis;Øyvind Seland;Gerd A. Folberth;Douglas I. Kelley,Historical trends and controlling factors of isoprene emissions in CMIP6 Earth system models,"Understanding historical isoprene emission changes is important for predicting future climate, but trends and their controlling factors remain uncertain. This study shows that long-term isoprene trends vary among Earth system models mainly due to partially incorporating CO2 effects and land cover changes rather than to climate. Future models that refine these factors’ effects on isoprene emissions, along with long-term observations, are essential for better understanding plant–climate interactions. 
 Terrestrial isoprene, a biogenic volatile organic compound emitted by many plants, indirectly influences Earth's radiative balance through its interactions with atmospheric oxidants, affecting ozone formation, methane lifetime, and secondary aerosol production. Elucidating its historical changes is therefore important for predicting climate change and air quality. Isoprene emissions can respond to climate (e.g. temperature, shortwave radiation, precipitation), land use and land cover change (LULCC), and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, historical trends of isoprene emissions and the relative influences of the respective drivers of those trends remain highly uncertain. This study addresses uncertainty in historical isoprene emission trends and their influential factors, particularly the roles of climate, LULCC, and atmospheric CO2 (via fertilization and inhibition effects). The findings are expected to reconcile discrepancies among different modelling approaches and to improve predictions of isoprene emissions and their climate change effects.To investigate isoprene emission trends, controlling factors, and discrepancies among models, we analysed long-term (1850–2014) global isoprene emissions from online simulations of CMIP6 Earth system models and offline simulations using the Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace gases (VISIT) dynamic vegetation model driven by climate reanalysis data.Mean annual global present-day isoprene emissions agree well among models (434–510 TgC yr−1) with a 5 % inter-model spread (24 TgC yr−1), but regional emissions differ greatly (9 %–212 % spread). All models show an increasing trend in global isoprene emissions in recent decades (1980–2014), but their magnitudes vary (+1.27 ± 0.49 TgC yr−2, 0.28 ± 0.11 % yr−1). Long-term trends of 1850–2014 show high uncertainty among models (−0.92 to +0.31 TgC yr−2).Results of emulated sensitivity experiments indicate meteorological variations as the main factor of year-to-year fluctuations, but the main drivers of long-term isoprene emission trends differ among models. Models without CO2 effects implicate climate change as the driver, but other models with CO2 effects (fertilization only/fertilization and inhibition) indicate CO2 and LULCC as the primary drivers. The discrepancies arise from how models account for CO2 and LULCC alongside climate effects on isoprene emissions. Aside from LULCC-induced reductions, differences in CO2 inhibition representation (strength and presence or absence of thresholds) were able to mitigate or reverse increasing trends because of rising temperatures or in combination with CO2 fertilization. Net CO2 effects on global isoprene emissions show the highest inter-model variation (σ=0.43 TgC yr−2), followed by LULCC effects (σ=0.17 TgC yr−2), with climate change effects exhibiting more or less variation (σ=0.06 TgC yr−2).The critical drivers of isoprene emission trends depend on a model's emission scheme complexity. This dependence emphasizes the need for models with accurate representation of CO2 and LULCC effects alongside climate change influences for robust long-term predictions. Important uncertainties remain in understanding the interplay between CO2, LULCC, and climate effects on isoprene emissions, mainly for CO2. More long-term observations of isoprene emissions across various biomes are necessary, along with improved models with varied CO2 responses. Moreover, instead of reliance on the current models, additional emission schemes can better capture isoprene emissions complexities and their effects on climate."

Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between flux and pool size data, where cumulative imbalances can reach hundreds of gigatons of carbon or nitrogen.

To enhance data quality, we recommend that future climate data protocols address this issue at the reporting stage. 
 Reliable, robust, and consistent data are essential foundations for analysis of carbon cycle feedbacks. Here, we consider the data from multiple Earth system models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We identify a mass conservation issue in the reported carbon and nitrogen data, with a few exceptions for specific models and reporting levels. The accumulated mass imbalance in the reported data can amount to hundreds of gigatons of carbon or nitrogen by the end of the simulated period, largely exceeding the total carbon–nitrogen pool size changes over the same period. Nitrogen mass imbalance is evident across all reported organic and inorganic pools, with mineral nitrogen exhibiting the most significant cumulative mass imbalance.  Due to a lack of detail in the reported data, we cannot uniquely identify the cause of this imbalance. However, we postulate that the carbon mass imbalance primarily arises from missing fluxes in the reported data and inconsistencies between these data and the definitions provided by the C4MIP protocol (e.g., land-use and fire emissions), rather than from an underlying mass conservation issue in the models themselves. Our findings suggest that future CMIP reporting protocols should consider incorporating mass conservation into their data validation processes so that such issues are caught before users have to deal with them, rather than forcing all users to handle this issue in their own way. In addition, attention from model groups to the detailed diagnostic request and definitions, along with their own quality control, will also help to avoid such issues in future. Given that no additional CMIP6 data are currently being published and none are expected in the future, we recommend that data users that rely on a closed carbon–nitrogen cycle address potential flux imbalances by using the workarounds provided in this study."

From a regional survey of 1448 rhizosphere soil-rice sample pairs in karst areas of Guangxi, China, we identified and characterized Mn-rich nodules from representative sites to investigate their role in Cd sequestration. Using chemical extractions combined with laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we revealed that Mn oxides serve as primary Cd carriers in Mn-rich nodules, accounting for approximately 63.6% of total Cd, dominating Cd enrichment through binding mechanisms of Cd–O and Cd–OH bonds characteristic of inner-sphere surface complexation and structural incorporation. The stability of these chemical interactions was confirmed by pH-dependent experiments, showing <5.0% of total Cd release even at pH = 3.0. The high Mn(III) mass ratios (36.0%–40.0%) in nodules facilitated stable inner-sphere complexation, resulting in increased Cd retention. These study findings reveal the exceptional Cd sequestration capacity of natural Mn-rich nodules, and provide insights for the high concentrations and low availabilities of soil Cd in karst, which can aid in developing strategies for managing Cd-polluted karst soils."

Most UHI studies have focused on the impacts of two-dimensional (2D) urbanization, which involves outward city expansion and increased built-up area. However, as cities mature, they typically transition from horizontal expansion to vertical densification (3D urbanization), leading to increased material stock density. The implications of this shift for the UHI effect remain underexplored. This study compared the 2D and 3D urbanization–induced impacts on UHI across 384 Chinese cities from 2000 to 2020, using impervious surface and gridded material stocks. Our results surprisingly indicated that 2D urbanization lost explanatory power of the UHI intensity when the impervious surface area percentage exceeded 87%. Relative importance analysis utilizing a random forest algorithm revealed that the population, vegetation abundance, and precipitation significantly moderated the effects of 3D urbanization, emphasizing the crucial role of urban green spaces in mitigating thermal stress. This study examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of the UHI effect in China, emphasizing the key role of 3D urbanization.

This study examines the behavior of Cd-loaded ferrihydrite (Fh) with/without organic matter (OM) undergoing S(-II)-induced reduction followed by O2-induced reoxidation. During sulfidation, S(-II) was fully consumed, and Fh was partially reduced to Fe(II) species, with some OM released from the Fh surface. Meanwhile, Cd initially adsorbed on Fh was completely converted to CdS, regardless of Cd loading or the presence of OM. Upon reoxidation, Fe(II) species were reoxidized to Fe(III) oxides, which recaptured OM, while solid-phase S(-II) was oxidized to S0 and sulfate. Concurrently, partial oxidation of CdS occurred, mainly driven by H2O2 generated during Fe(II) oxidation, with minor contributions from •OH and O2, but OM inhibited CdS oxidation, primarily by scavenging H2O2. Released Cd from CdS oxidation was predominantly readsorbed on Fe(III) oxides. Additionally, released Cd was partially structurally incorporated into newly formed Fe(III) oxides while some CdS was encapsulated within Fe(III) oxide aggregates. However, OM interactions with Fe(III) oxides reduced the formation of these Cd species. These findings provide insights into the molecular-scale mechanisms governing Cd dynamics in redox-dynamic environments."

Recent evidence suggests that AnAOB can perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), potentially coupling Fe(III) reduction with NH4+–N oxidation (Feammox). However, whether AnAOB directly participate in Feammox within complex wastewater treatment systems remains unclear. Here, we investigated the iron-mediated nitrogen metabolism pathways in a microaerobic granular sludge (MGS) reactor by integrating enzyme inhibition assays with analyses of gene dynamics and co-occurrence patterns of nitrogen- and iron-cycling genes. Results demonstrate that AnAOB contributed to Feammox activity. The iron reduction gene CT573071, coding a porin-cytochrome c protein complex associated with EET, co-occurred with hao, hzsABC, and hdh genes in Candidatus Kuenenia, suggesting its role in Feammox. Furthermore, four high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated with Kuenenia stuttgartiensis_A harbored CT573071, hao-like, hzsABC, and hdh genes, along with the hao-cluster, which catalyzes the oxidation of NH4+–N to hydroxylamine. This genomic evidence further supports their dual metabolic capacity. Metatranscriptomic analysis confirmed CT573071 upregulation and its coexpression with the hao, hzsABC, and hdh genes.

Despite global efforts to reduce pollution, significant pollutant levels in these whales underscore the persistence of legacy contaminants and the widespread use of PCAs. Most pollutants were concentrated in lipid-rich blubber, while PCAs exhibited particularly high levels in whole blood (941–13100 ng/g lipid), indicating tissue-specific accumulation. Blubber pollutant levels were similar to those of harbor porpoises from the same waters, with p,p′-DDE (1020–2280 ng/g lipid) and PCBs (1230–1930 ng/g lipid) exceeding or nearing effect thresholds. Blood concentrations of legacy pollutants were approximately an order of magnitude higher than those in humans from the region, while PCA levels were comparable to those of humans.

Pronounced north‐south hemispheric differences in this asymmetry, by up to 40 days, were attributed to the eccentricity of Earth's orbit. However, we propose that the dominant factor comes from the difference in the land‐sea fraction between hemispheres, because the asymmetry is strongly influenced by the annually varying heat capacity and land‐sea interactions. The oceanic temperature annual cycle generally features a longer cooling period than warming due to the seasonal variation in ocean mixed layer depth, and exhibits the opposite situation when there is seasonal sea ice.

Coarse graining predicts 68% of energy fluxing to dissipation from frequencies lower than 8cpd, while the weakly nonlinear method predicts 34%.

Changes in the freeze duration are significantly correlated with the following factors: air temperature in spring, autumn and winter, snow depth in spring, autumn and winter; and vegetation in autumn.

Thompson;Thomas Wahl,Impact‐Based Thresholds for Investigation of High‐Tide Flooding in the United States,"High‐tide flooding—minor, disruptive coastal inundation—is expected to become more frequent as sea levels rise. However, quantifying just how quickly high‐tide flooding rates are changing, and whether some places experience more high‐tide flooding than others, is challenging. To quantify trends in high‐tide flooding from tide‐gauge observations, flood thresholds—elevations above which flooding begins—must be specified. Past studies of high‐tide flooding in the United States have used different data sets and approaches for specifying flood thresholds, only some of which directly relate to coastal impacts, which has lead to sometimes conflicting and ambiguous results. Here we present a novel method for quantifying, with uncertainty, high‐tide flooding thresholds along the United States coast based on sparsely available impact‐based flood thresholds. We use those newly modeled thresholds to make an updated assessment of changes in high‐tide flooding across the United States over the past few decades. From 1990–2000 to 2010–2020, high‐tide flooding rates almost certainly (probability P>99% $P > 99\%$) increased along the United States East Coast, Gulf Coast, California, and Pacific Islands, while they very likely (P=93%) $(P=93\%)$ decreased along Alaska during that time; significant changes in high‐tide flooding rates between the two decades were not detected in Oregon, Washington, and the Caribbean. Averaging spatially, we find that high‐tide flooding rates probably (P=85%) $(P=85\%)$ more than doubled nationally between 1990–2000 and 2010–2020. Our approach lays a foundation for future studies to more accurately model high‐tide flood thresholds and trends along the global coastline."

Huang,Grain for Green Program to Grassland Might Lead to Carbon Sink Leakage in the Loess Plateau,"Grain for Green Program (GFGP), China's most famous ecological program, has become the main driver of carbon sink increases. However, the potential of the carbon sink effect still lacks scenario‐based systematic estimation. By backdating the GFGP carbon sink increase in the Loess Plateau (LP) over the past 20 years, we forecast and reveal the spatial distribution of the carbon sink and the contribution of the GFGP in the “Double Carbon Target” years under three scenarios. Our results showed that places restored to forests (GFGP‐Forest) will always lead to a carbon sink increase by (33.62 Tg C for 2000–2020) 0.78–1.09 Tg C and 1.29–2.13 Tg C in 2030 and 2060, respectively. However, the places restored to grasslands (GFGP‐Grassland) will lead to an increase for 2000–2020 (72.52 Tg C), but a decrease in 2030 and 2060 (0.89–9.95 Tg C and 7.42–11.18 Tg C). This conversion is due to the combination of the decrease of the Net Primary Productivity and the increase of the heterotrophic respiration in the future, which indicates that the restoration programs involved in converting croplands into grasslands will severely decrease the carbon sink benefits and potential. In summary, it is essential to correctly quantify the carbon contribution in the LP resulting from the GFGP, and properly manage to augment the carbon sink from the GFGP‐Forest and avoid the carbon source of GFGP‐Grassland in the future. Our results highlight the hidden danger of leaking carbon sink of grasslands in a typical semi‐arid region under future climate‐changing conditions."

Roughly four trillion liters were generated onshore in the United States in 2021 (ALL Consulting, 2022, https://www.gwpc.org/wp‐content/uploads/2021/09/2021_Produced_Water_Volumes.pdf). Efforts are underway to expand historic uses of produced water to offset freshwater needs in water‐stressed regions, avoid induced seismic activity associated with its disposal, and extract commodities. Understanding the potential exposures from current and proposed produced water uses and management practices can help to inform health‐protective practices. This review summarizes what is known about potential human exposure to produced water from onshore oil and gas development in the United States. We synthesize 236 publications to create a conceptual model of potential human exposure that illustrates the current state of scientific inquiry and knowledge. Exposure to produced water can occur following its release to the environment through spills or leaks during its handling and management. Exposure can also arise from authorized releases, including permitted discharges to surface water, crop irrigation, and road treatment. Knowledge gaps include understanding the variable composition and toxicity of produced water released to the environment, the performance of treatment methods, migration pathways through the environment that can result in human exposure, and the significance of the exposures for human and ecosystem health. Reducing these uncertainties may help in realizing the benefits of produced water use while simultaneously protecting human health."

To quantify heat exposure more effectively, integrated heat stress indicators (HSIs) have been developed to simplify the classification of heat stress severity and assist in public heat warnings. However, their ability to accurately predict daily heat stroke cases has not been fully assessed. In this study, we evaluated the performance of multiple HSIs in forecasting the number of heat stroke‐related emergency ambulance dispatches (HT‐EADs) across 47 prefectures in Japan and compared their accuracy to models using raw meteorological variables. Our results indicate that, while HSIs simplify the process of assessing heat stress, they generally show lower performances than models based on raw meteorological data. Among the eight HSIs tested, the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (TWBG) showed the strongest predictive power, with median R2 values of 0.77 and 0.70 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. However, models incorporating air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation outperformed TWBG, achieving R2 values of 0.85 and 0.74. We also observed spatial variability in HSI performance, particularly in cooler regions like Hokkaido, where HSIs provided no improvement over temperature alone. Given these findings, we recommend that HSIs be rigorously evaluated with local health data before being used in heat warning systems for specific locations. For predictions requiring high accuracy, raw meteorological variables could be prioritized to ensure greater precision."

 The rheology of the lower crust and upper mantle influences Earth’s plate tectonic style of mantle convection, yet its spatial variability is poorly resolved, particularly in continental interiors. Here we use satellite radar interferometry to map the delayed uplift resulting from the desiccation of the Aral Sea, which has lost ~1,000 km3 of water since 1960. From this we constrain the rheology of the underlying upper mantle by elastic and viscoelastic modelling. We find a long-wavelength uplift of up to ~7 mm yr–1 between 2016 and 2020 that decays radially from the Aral Sea. This uplift pattern is best explained by viscoelastic relaxation of the asthenosphere below a strong lithospheric mantle. We estimate that the asthenosphere has an effective viscosity of 4–7 × 1019 Pa s below 130–190 km depth, slightly larger than the values inferred from post-seismic deformation at subduction zones, but 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than estimates from glacial isostatic adjustment in other tectonically stable regions. Such uplift highlights the potential for human activities to influence deep-Earth dynamics and the interconnectedness of surface and mantle processes.

 Climate records have been broken with alarming regularity in recent years, but the events of 2023–2024 were exceptional even when accounting for recent climatic trends. Here we quantify these events across multiple variables and show how excess energy accumulation in the Earth system drove the exceptional conditions. Key factors were the positive decadal trend in Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI), persistent La Niña conditions beginning in 2020, and the switch to El Niño in 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, the heating from EEI was over 75% larger than during the onset of similar recent El Niño events. We show further how regional processes shaped distinct patterns of record-breaking sea surface temperatures in individual ocean basins. If the recent trend in EEI is maintained, we argue that natural fluctuations such as ENSO cycles will increasingly lead to amplified, record-breaking impacts, with 2023–2024 serving as a glimpse of future climate extremes."

 Atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) measures the difference between saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure, and its variability is closely related to fire activity in the western United States (US). Here, we assess the forecast skill of monthly VPD variability using a state-of-the-art dynamical forecast system and statistical predictions, such as the persistence forecast and model-analog forecasts. In the model-analog framework, we select analog states resembling the observed initial conditions from the model space, and the subsequent evolution of those initial model-analogs yields forecast ensembles. Dynamical forecasts demonstrate skillful predictions of VPD variability in the western US, exceeding the persistence forecast skill, which indicates additional sources of VPD predictability within the climate system. To quantify the contribution of different climate variables to VPD prediction, we develop a weighted model-analog forecast and evaluate its skill in comparison to VPD-only and unweighted forecasts. Our findings suggest that sea surface temperature is a critical source of VPD predictability over the western US. The optimally weighted model-analog exhibits forecast skill for VPD variability comparable to that of the dynamical forecast system."

10.1016/j.rse.2025.114709,False,Remote Sensing of Environment,该论文提出了一种直接从卫星数字量化值（DN）数据反演水质参数（WQP）的方法，称为DN2WP。该方法以透明度（ZSD）为例，利用Sentinel-3的数据作为参考，将HiSea-II、HY-1C和SDGSAT-1等卫星的DN数据直接转换为ZSD。实验结果表明，DN2WP方法在水质参数估计方面优于传统的多步骤方法，并且在不同卫星任务之间具有更好的一致性。因此，该论文主要关注水质遥感，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关系不大。,"['water quality', 'ocean color', 'satellite data', 'Secchi Disk Depth (ZSD)', 'Sentinel-3', 'HiSea-II', 'HY-1C', 'SDGSAT-1']",Hanyang Qiao;Zhongping Lee;Daosheng Wang;Zhihuang Zheng;Xiaomin Ye;Changyong Dou,One-step retrieval of water-quality parameters from satellite top-of-atmosphere measurements,"•A one-step system (DN2WP) is developed to retrieve water-quality parameters (WQP) directly from satellite DN data. •With appropriate reference data, DN2WP obtains better water-quality estimation than traditional multi-step approaches. •With WQP from mature ocean-color satellites, DN2WP opens a new route for the generation of WQP from non-conventional satellites. 
 Traditionally, deriving water-quality parameters from satellite ocean color measurements involves multiple complex steps, including in-orbit radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and water property retrieval, all of which require substantial resources and effort. Given the abundance of water-quality related products provided by established ocean color satellite missions, we propose a scheme (DN2WP) to estimate water-quality parameters directly from the digital number (DN) data obtained at satellite altitude. Using Secchi Disk Depth (ZSD) as an example and the ZSD data from Sentinel-3 as a reference, HiSea-II DN data were converted to ZSD directly by DN2WP. In the training phase, the coefficient of determination (R2) for ZSD reached 0.95, with a mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of ∼10 %. When applied to new datasets, the R2 for ZSD exceeded 0.8, and the MAPD remained within 20 %. The DN2WP scheme was further tested using the multispectral sensors of the CZI on board the HY-1C satellite and MII on the SDGSAT-1 satellite, respectively, and a high level of performance was maintained by achieving an R2 of 0.83 (0.84) with MAPD as 19.8 % (15.8 %) for CZI (SDGSAT-1) on independent data. These results are significantly better than the consistency measure of ZSD between such satellites and Sentinel-3A/3B obtained individually through the traditional multi-step approach. It indicates that DN2WP is an efficient approach to get water-quality parameters from top-of-atmosphere DN data measured by a satellite sensor, which also results in much better consistency across different satellite missions."

 Delivery of suspended particles, referred hereafter also to as suspended sediment, to coastal zones plays a first order control on the development and maintenance of muddy geomorphic features like river deltas, mudflats, and tidal wetlands. While sediment delivery from rivers is relatively straightforward to monitor and has been well studied, suspended sediment derived from erosion of coastal bluffs and resuspension of shallow subtidal sediments remains poorly constrained. Estimates of the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) provide one of the best remotely sensed metrics for suspended sediment supply to the coast. Spaceborne ocean color sensors with coarse spatial resolution (∼1 km pixel size at nadir) are generally inadequate to resolve smaller-scale sediment dynamics in coastal waters and additionally there is a limitation associated with adjacency effect of 1-km land pixels on near-shore water pixels. In contrast, satellites dedicated primarily to land observations with a smaller pixel size (∼30 m) provide more adequate spatial resolution for observations of coastal waters. This paper presents a particle composition adaptive algorithm for retrieving SPM from ocean remote-sensing reflectance, Rrs(λ), in coastal waters which is applicable to most land observation satellites. For the algorithm development, we compiled more than 800 paired in situ spectral reflectance and SPM measurements from 12 marine sites worldwide, representing a wide range of suspended particle concentration and composition. We first classify the satellite image data into three water types: organic-rich, mineral-rich, or extremely mineral-rich based on the POC/SPM ratio that is derived from Rrs(λ). The ratio of particulate organic carbon (POC) to SPM serves as a particle composition metric. Then, SPM is estimated from Rrs(λ) using a particle composition-specific algorithm which employs the reflectance at red band for organic-rich waters and near-infrared (NIR) for mineral-rich waters. We compared the performance of this algorithm with eight previously published SPM algorithms, including empirical, semi-analytical, and machine learning approaches. Results show that our algorithm produces reliable SPM estimation with coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE in log space), and median absolute percent error (MAPE) of 0.91, 0.20, and 30.5 %, respectively. To examine the capability of our algorithm to study the long-term variability in coastal SPM at high spatial resolution, we implemented the algorithm to the 40-year Landsat data archive in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Landsat mapping results of SPM were validated using both the satellite-in situ matchups of SPM data as well as in situ water turbidity measurements. Finally, we demonstrate a few scenarios of fine-scale SPM patterns as well as seasonal and long-term variability across different marine coastal environments using the satellite high spatial resolution SPM mapping. These results collectively demonstrate the promise of this new SPM retrieval algorithm for mapping and monitoring global coastal suspended sediment dynamics."

 Hydraulic erosion-induced soil loss critically undermines soil fertility, leading to vegetation degradation, reduced crop yields, and increased flood and pollution risks, thereby threatening food security, ecological integrity, and economic stability. Existing soil erosion estimations using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model are constrained by the absence of high-resolution (30 m) nationwide rainfall data, significant spatial and temporal inconsistencies among multi-source data, and limited regional adaptability of empirical RUSLE parameters. To address these challenges, we developed the first 30-m resolution Hydraulic Soil Erosion Dataset (CSWED) for Chinese mainland, spanning from 1990 to 2022. This was achieved by implementing a Random Forest (RF) interpolation method to generate 30-m annual rainfall data and designing a multi-equation combined vegetation cover management factor tailored to China’s diverse soil characteristics. The mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the China Soil and Water Conservation Bulletin was 9.48%, and the CSWED illustrates good consistency with collected runoff plot observation data, significantly surpassing the accuracy of existing publicly available datasets. Our analysis reveals a predominant influence of slope length, steepness, and support practice factors on soil erosion, coupled with a synergistic effect of vegetation cover and topography. Notably, soil erosion in Chinese mainland has exhibited an overall decreasing trend from 1990 to 2022, with significant reductions in light, moderate, and severe erosion categories by 31.70%, 22.24%, and 44.74%, respectively. Also, the sensitivity of soil erosion in 2022 was dominated by strong sensitivity and moderate sensitivity, accounting for 74.149 % and 14.072 %. Then, the decrease in cropland area creates a decrease in soil erosion of 123.54 t/hm2 from 1990 to 2022, while for every additional hectare of forested area, soil erosion was reduced by 58.67 t. Special attention should be given to the substantial expansion of soil erosion brought on by extreme rainfall in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River (MLYR) and Southwest China (SWC), where mean soil erosion was 11.71 t/(hm2a) and 15.79 t/(hm2a), respectively, accounting for 60% of the national total."

 Monitoring and mapping of forest stands, including tree species composition can support forest protection and management. Sentinel-2 imagery provide a viable data source due to their high spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution. However, especially in temperate mixed forests challenges with tree species classification persist, mainly due to the high mixing ratio of tree species, which cannot be fully resolved even with the 10 m resolution of Sentinel-2 data. Additional challenges are associated with the commonly low number of reference data for rare tree species, resulting in low classification accuracy for these species. This study proposes an approach to map sub-pixel tree species fractions in mixed temperate forests by combining dense annual multi-spectral Sentinel-2 time series to target differences between species in phenological relevant periods with synthetically mixed training data. This allows for a limited number of pure training samples per tree species, which serves as basis for randomized linear mixing to compute a synthetic spectral library. An artificial neural network is trained for regression for tree species fractions per pixel. To enhance model robustness and stabilize predictions, we implemented this library generation and artificial neural network regression as an ensemble approach. We effectively mapped tree species fractions for the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, with Mean Absolute Errors of 2.76% to 16.05% and R2 values up to 0.92 – when validated against forest planning data. We show that the data augmentation through synthetic mixing allows for a sample size as small as 30 pure pixels per class, to sufficiently distinguish nine tree species and one ‘other species’ class, hence substantially increasing the operational potential for deployment when reference data for rare species are limited – while simultaneously generating accurate and information-rich tree species distributions over large areas of mixed forest."

 In this study, we investigated the seasonal distribution of extreme surface ozone (O3) episodes in association with meteorological conditions over the Arabian Gulf (AG) between 2016 and 2019. We used hourly surface O3 measurements from the United States Embassy in Manama and air temperature observations from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. We computed the maximum daily 8-h average of O3 using the Air Quality Index methodology. The results showed that the air quality in Manama can be categorized as “good,” “moderate,” “unhealthy for sensitive groups,” “unhealthy,” and “very unhealthy” for 45.31 %, 20.61 %, 19.08 %, 11.63 %, and 3.37 % of the time, respectively.

Our analysis of surface O3 values obtained from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service showed that the O3 levels during summer extremes were higher by 10 ppb than their climatological mean. We then categorized the O3 summer extremes into single-day episodes (SDEs) and multi-day episodes (MDEs), revealing that most of the extremes (73.58 %) were MDEs. An analysis of meteorological conditions using the fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, MODIS-Terra, and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System database revealed that the MDEs exhibit increased temperatures, temperature subsidence form the mid-troposphere, weakened wind speeds, low aerosol optical depth, and increased insolation. These conditions are less pronounced during SDEs. Moreover, 5.67 % of the summer extremes were associated with stratospheric intrusions."

 In August 2022 and 2024, Southern China experienced unprecedented heatwaves. Using ERA5 reanalysis data, we conducted a comparative analysis of the similarities and differences between these two extreme heatwaves. Our findings reveal that while the 2024 heatwave was less intense than the one in 2022, it was more concentrated in late August, unlike the prolonged heatwave in 2022, which spanned the entire month. Despite these variations in intensity and duration, both heatwaves were driven by a common atmospheric mechanism: anomalous easterly winds resulted in subsidence and significant temperature anomalies across Southern China. These easterly winds were closely associated with an anticyclone anomaly over the region, influenced by an upstream wave train from Europe. Crucially, warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Barents Sea played a vital role in sustaining and forming this wave train. To further validate this mechanism, we conducted a regression analysis using historical data from 1979 to 2024, confirming its broad applicability in explaining heatwaves in Southern China, including those of shorter durations like the 2024 event. This study significantly advances our understanding of heatwave dynamics in Southern China and offers novel insights that can improve future predictive capabilities."
