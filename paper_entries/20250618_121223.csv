Solar-powered mini-grids are being used to increase rural electrification. However, their deployment is hindered by high costs, low electricity demand, and limited incomes in rural households. Agriculture constitutes 70% of rural incomes in SSA and faces threats due to a reliance on rainfall coupled with low irrigation levels in the context of climate change. Irrigation loads have been suggested as a strategy to enhance the economic viability of solar mini-grids by boosting electricity demand: reducing the levelised cost of used electricity (LCUE) whilst improving farmer yields and incomes. This study investigates a case study in Tanzania, selected based on the amount of population without access to electricity, the potential for irrigation, and the prevalence of photovoltaic solutions in the least-cost pathways for rural electrification. The seasonality and timing of irrigation demand, as well as crop mixes, are varied to optimise for the lowest LCUE using the open-source modelling framework continuous lifetime optimisation of variable electricity resources. Evapo-transpiration and energy-system modelling are used to estimate energy demand. We find that adding irrigation loads has the potential to increase the LCUE and lower asset utilisation (load factor) when compared to residential loads but that, by selecting crops with longer growth periods, optimising irrigation timing, and implementing multiple planting seasons, the LCUE can be up to 7% less than residential-only systems with an increase seen in asset utilisation. LCUE values of 0.54–1.30 $/kWh were found: higher costs were associated with shorter crop-growth periods, single planting seasons, and poorly timed irrigation loads whilst lower costs were observed with bimodal cropping and solar-coordinated irrigation times. The research highlights that, when incorporating irrigation loads into rural-electrification strategies, specific factors should be considered to enhance their viability within mini-grids in SSA. We recommend to both policymakers and mini-grid developers to promote multiple planting seasons (bimodal cropping) and encourage optimal crop mixes where relevant alongside irrigation schemes and rural electrification projects as well as adopting the use of flexible tariffs for irrigation loads."

While advancements have been made in space-based NO2 observations and retrievals, most measurements are still unable to resolve the detailed structure of NO2 plumes. Designed primarily for aerosol and ocean applications, the plankton, aerosol, cloud, ocean ecosystem ocean color instrument (OCI) provides a unique opportunity to retrieve NO2 from high spatial resolution (∼1 km)2 hyper-spectral measurements. We exploit a machine learning technique to show that OCI, with a spectral resolution of 5 nm, can provide high spatial resolution information about NO2 when trained with high quality retrievals from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). This work demonstrates the potential to rapidly produce high spatial resolution NO2 columns by making use of well validated retrievals derived from instruments with higher spectral resolution. These data can potentially enable emissions estimates with reduced uncertainties and higher spatial resolution. Additionally, the data could provide higher resolution information for exposure estimates used in epidemiological studies."

In systems with alternative stable states maintained by feedback mechanisms, such shifts are difficult to reverse due to hysteresis. These systems may show early warning signals (EWSs) (e.g. critical slowing down (CSD)), indicating ecological resilience loss prior to an RS. CSD manifests as a reduced rate of recovery from disturbances and can be detected through increasing temporal autocorrelation at-lag-1 (AC1) in vegetation indicator time series. While studies increasingly use remote sensing data (e.g. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to evaluate CSD in natural ecosystems, most lack in-field validation and are conducted at broad spatial scales, limiting real-world applicability. Here, we assess whether EWSs precede RSs in Zambian wet Miombo woodlands by combining field-based vegetation data with remote sensing time series. We investigate (i) whether RSs in the Miombo woodlands can be detected using field data on vegetation structure and remote sensing data, (ii) the relationship between fire frequency and RSs, and (iii) if increasing AC1 precedes an RS. Our findings demonstrate the occurrence of RSs in Miombo woodlands and provide empirical evidence supporting the use of CSD as a predictive tool. Spatial models showed that both a high fire frequency and an increasing AC1 preceding the shift are significantly (p < 0.05) linked to RS occurrence. This study highlights the importance of integrating field and remote sensing data to monitor ecosystem transitions. By identifying resilience loss and RS occurrence, our approach offers valuable insights for conservation and restoration planning, emphasizing the need for adaptive fire management strategies to mitigate degradation and promote ecosystem recovery."

To investigate their properties and changes on a global scale, observational records are often complemented by climate models such as those from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). However, typical CMIP6 models have a grid spacing of about 100 km and, therefore, do not allow the representation of extremes at local scales important for impacts. Here, we provide a global view on the information lost at such resolutions, focusing on temperature and precipitation extremes. We draw on two next-generation, km-scale global climate models, run with a grid spacing of about 10 km, and regrid them to a range of coarser resolutions. From the regridded data, we then investigate the spatial sub-grid variability hidden at the CMIP6-like 100 km grid spacing to quantify the effect resolution has on the representation of extremes globally. We find clear patterns of such a resolution effect on a diverse set of temperature extremes, particularly in mountainous areas, at coastlines, and along large rivers. For the example of annual maximum temperature, the difference between the 10 km and 100 km grid spacings can exceed 10 ∘C. For precipitation, globally aggregated low and high extremes are shown to be underestimated at coarse resolution, with the strongest spatial signals emerging in regions with complex topography and in the tropics. Our results quantify existing knowledge and demonstrate the importance of spatial resolution for the representation of climate extremes, in particular for hotspot regions such as coastlines, which often coincide with densely populated areas. The advent of ever higher resolved global models, hence, allows improved estimates of local climate impacts and related risk assessments with global coverage."

However, current energy system models often address sustainability too narrowly with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions during the operational phase, and neglecting other environmental impacts can lead to suboptimal and unsustainable energy systems. This study integrates environmental impacts and planetary boundaries as constraints into a multi-sectoral energy system model to explore sustainable configurations for the European energy system in 2050. Our results indicate that it will not be possible to stay within all allocated carrying capacities without a combined application of energy demand reduction, large-scale deployment of renewable energies, electrification of heating, and technological improvements. Specifically, with the most permissive allocation principle, European electricity and heat demand must be limited to 3550 and 4655 to remain within the planetary boundaries, which represents a 22% and 24% reduction compared to 2050 projected final energy demand for the sectors of electricity and heat, excluding transport and fuels demands. Results show that scenario normally considered ‘Net Zero’ would transgress the allocated budget for climate change by 70%, despite a high deployment of renewable energies, when life cycle impacts are considered. All generated scenarios highly rely on renewable energies and the electrification of heating. The analysis of the different scenarios highlights substantial burden shifts across carrying capacities when only considering climate change and praises a global environmental approach in decision-making. Climate change, land use and particulate matter are identified as the most impacted categories when designing an energy system."

It provides valuable insights into how reservoir storage grew by 130 % between 2008 and 2017, driven by dams in key river basins. Our data also reveal how droughts, like the 2019–2020 event, significantly impacted water reservoirs. This resource can aid water management, drought planning, and research globally. 
 The recent surge in reservoir construction has increased global surface water storage, with Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) being a significant hotspot. Such infrastructural evolution demands updates in water management strategies and hydrological models. However, information on actual reservoir storage is hard to acquire, especially for transboundary river basins. To date, no high-resolution spatiotemporal dataset on absolute storage time series is available for reservoirs in MSEA. To address this gap, we present (1) a comprehensive open-access database of absolute storage time series (sub-monthly) for 186 reservoirs (larger than 0.1 km3) in MSEA spanning the period 1985–2023 and (2) an analysis of the reservoir storage dynamics. This dataset is derived from remote sensing observations, integrating satellite-based water surface area extraction from high-resolution (30 m) images and area–elevation–storage (A–E–S) relationships to estimate reservoir level and storage dynamics. The MSEA database includes static (area–elevation–storage curves, water frequency, and reservoir extent) and dynamic (area, water level, and absolute storage time series) components for each reservoir. The 186 reservoirs collectively store around 175 km3 of water, with a minimum of 140 km3 and a maximum of 210 km3. They cover an average area of 8700 km2, ranging from a minimum of 6500 km2 to a maximum of 10 000 km2. We show that the combined average reservoir storage increased from 70 to 160 km3 (+130 %) from 2008 to 2017, primarily contributed by reservoirs in the Irrawaddy, Red, Upper Mekong, and Lower Mekong basins. Our in situ validation provides a good match between estimated storage and in situ observations, with 50 % of the validation sites (10 out of 20) showing an R2>0.7 and an average nRMSE < 14 %. The indirect validation (based on altimetry-converted storage) shows even better results, with an R2>0.7 and an average nRMSE < 12 % for 70 % (14 out of 20) of the reservoirs. Furthermore, the analysis of the 2019–2020 drought event in the MSEA region reveals that nearly 30 %–40 % of the region experienced more than 5 months of drought, with the most significant impact on reservoirs in Cambodia and Thailand. As a result, storage departures ranged by up to −40 % in some reservoirs, highlighting significant impacts on water availability. Overall, this analysis demonstrates the potential of the inferred storage time series for assessing real-life water-related problems in Mainland Southeast Asia, with the possibility of applying the method to estimate reservoir storage time series in other parts of the world. The reservoir storage database in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA-Res database) and the associated Python code are publicly available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14844580 (Mahto et al., 2025)."

The satellite-retrieved dataset reports an average global CO2 enhancements of 0.58 ± 1.81 ppm and a 60 % higher CO2 enhancement (1.43 ± 2.04 ppm) in global urban areas. 
 We present a novel global dataset of CO2 enhancements (ΔXCO2) derived by fusing NASA’s OCO-3 satellite and NOAA ground-based observations. CO2 enhancements quantify the spatially resolved excess in atmospheric CO2 concentrations arising from anthropogenic emissions, biospheric CO2 exchanges, and atmospheric CO2 transport. Leveraging decades of monthly CO2 measurements from eight remote stations strictly selected from NOAA ESRL network, such as the Mauna Loa station, we address the critical challenge of isolating localized CO2 signals from background concentrations by developing a latitude-dependent global CO2 baseline model that effectively captures spatial and seasonal variability in background CO2. The developed baseline model demonstrates near-perfect hemispheric predictive accuracy (Northern: R2=0.988, RMSE=1.78 ppm; Southern: R2=0.995, RMSE=1.09 ppm). Spatially explicit ΔXCO2 is then estimated by removing the column-corrected background CO2 from co-located OCO-3 observations. Validations of the estimated ΔXCO2 against tropospheric NO2 (R2=0.896) and prior in-situ urban CO2 measurements, along with the dataset's high spatiotemporal resolution (~ 3 km2), demonstrates its potential for tracking anthropogenic and biospheric CO2 dynamics. Global ΔXCO2 maps reveal mean CO2 enhancements of 0.58 ± 1.81 ppm, with urban areas exhibiting 1.5-fold higher enhancements (1.43 ± 2.04 ppm). North Hemisphere land areas exhibits an approximately 81 % higher ΔXCO2 average (0.67 ± 1.98 ppm) compared to the South Hemisphere (0.37 ± 1.32 ppm), with urban enhancements amplifying this hemispheric contrast up to 95 %. Comprising 54 million observations across more than 200 countries, this open-access dataset provides an alternative metric for monitoring complex atmospheric CO2 variability and actionable insights for regional climate policies, available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15209825."

Anderson,FLAME 1.0: a novel approach for modelling burned area in the Brazilian biomes using the maximum entropy concept,"As fire seasons in Brazil become increasingly severe, confidently understanding the factors driving fires is more critical than ever. To address this challenge, we developed FLAME (Fire Landscape Analysis using Maximum Entropy), a new model designed to predict fires and to analyse the spatial influence of both environmental and human factors while accounting for uncertainties. By adapting the model to different regions, we can enhance fire management strategies, making FLAME a powerful tool for protecting landscapes in Brazil and beyond. 
 As fire seasons in Brazil lengthen and intensify, the need to enhance fire simulations and to comprehend fire drivers becomes crucial. Yet determining what drives burning in different Brazilian biomes is a major challenge, with a highly uncertain relationship between drivers and fire. Finding ways to acknowledge and quantify that uncertainty is critical in ascertaining the causes of Brazil's changing fire regimes. We propose FLAME (Fire Landscape Analysis using Maximum Entropy), a new fire model that integrates Bayesian inference with the maximum entropy concept, enabling probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty quantification. FLAME utilises bioclimatic, land cover, and human driving variables to model fires. We apply FLAME to Brazilian biomes, evaluating its performance against observed data for three categories of fires: all fires (ALL), fires reaching natural vegetation (NAT), and fires in non-natural vegetation (NON). We assessed burned-area responses to different explanatory variable groups. The model showed adequate performance for all biomes and fire categories. Together, maximum temperature and precipitation are important factors influencing burned area in all biomes. The number of roads and forest boundaries (edge densities), forests and pastures, and carbon in dead vegetation showed higher uncertainties among the responses. Overall, the uncertainties were larger for the NON category, particularly for the Pampas and Pantanal regions. Customising explanatory variable selection and fire categories based on biome characteristics could contribute to a more biome-focused and contextually relevant analysis. Moreover, prioritising regional-scale analysis is essential for decision-makers and fire management strategies. FLAME is easily adaptable and can be used in various locations and periods, serving as a valuable tool for more informed and effective fire prevention measures."

Herein, the initial retention performance of E. coli onto six types of plastics, both without and with N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs, a common signal molecule) at concentrations ranging from 10 ng/L to 100 μg/L in suspension, was determined to reveal the influence of signal molecules on the formation of the plastisphere. We found that AHLs coexisting in suspensions significantly enhanced bacterial adhesion performance onto plastics, regardless of plastic types and AHL types, with a more pronounced enhancement observed at higher AHL concentrations. This enhanced bacterial adhesion induced by AHLs also held true in solutions containing humic acid, in river water, and in sewage. AHLs stimulated the synthesis of EPS, enhanced EPS hydrophobicity by altering the protein/polysaccharide ratio and its secondary structures, and upregulated pathways related to flagellar assembly, quorum sensing, protein production, and biofilm formation, thereby enhancing bacterial adhesion capability onto plastics. Moreover, AHLs adsorbed onto plastic surfaces could induce chemoattraction effects, further promoting bacterial adhesion performance. Obviously, through various mechanisms, the signal molecules greatly influence the initial adhesion of bacteria onto plastics in aquatic systems."

Regarding indirect photochemistry, 3CDOM* plays a role in the degradation of 6PPD and IPPD but not 6PPD-Q, while 1O2 does not play a significant role for any of the compounds. Reaction rate constants are reported as well as 6PPD-Q molar yields from 6PPD, which were minimal for all aqueous pathways examined. 6PPD-Q may have a longer environmental lifetime as there are fewer degradation pathways.

Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs) are crucial for OMP degradation during riverbank filtration (RBF) and significantly influenced by NH4+-N concentrations. However, the effect of NH4+-N on OMP removal and ARG occurrence in RBF remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the effects of low (∼0.1 mg/L) and high (∼2.2 mg/L) NH4+-N concentrations on OMP removal, ARG occurrence, and microbial communities. NH4+-N addition had no significant effect on the removal of 108 out of 128 OMPs, suggesting that other factors primarily govern the removal process. Notably, NH4+-N addition enhanced the removal of 20 OMPs by 3–70%, including three quinolones (e.g., flumequine), indicating its promotion of specific OMP removals. This effect may primarily result from NH4+-N enhancing OMP biotransformation through the stimulation of AOMs (particularly AOA and comammox) and heterotrophs (e.g., Bradyrhizobium). Furthermore, NH4+-N addition significantly reduced the abundance of eight ARGs, including quinolone ARGs, likely due to its inhibition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Additionally, we hypothesize that NH4+-N alleviates OMP selective pressure on microorganisms by promoting OMP conversion through AOMs. This study enhances the understanding of microbe-mediated OMP removal in the presence of NH4+-N and its impact on ARG occurrence during RBF."

For four decades, MnO2 has been regarded as both a catalyst and the primary oxidant in the abiotic oxidative transformation of organic chemicals into OM, while dissolved oxygen (DO) is considered a minor or negligible oxidant when copresent with MnO2. Here, we investigated a well-known abiotic OM formation process: the reaction of catechol (a polyphenol) with MnO2 and DO under varying pH conditions. The results demonstrated that oxygenated alkaline conditions could enhance catechol oxidation. Both the DO and pH were important factors governing the transformation rate and structure of OM. Three oxidation routes were involved in the oxidative transformation of catechol, including two direct oxidation routes and a surface-catalyzed route. Specifically, MnO2 promoted OM polymerization under circumneutral conditions, whereas DO promoted ring cleavage and hydroxylation under alkaline conditions. For the first time, DO regeneration was observed during polyphenol transformation with MnO2 under oxygenated alkaline conditions. This study advances the understanding of OM transformation in natural environments and has implications for artificial OM production, biomass recycling, carbon cycle management, and climate change mitigation."

While prevalent in high-temperature ecosystems, the mechanisms regulating temperature-dependent denitrification remain unclear. To address this gap, we used hot springs with different temperatures (ranging from 37 to 75 °C) as representative environments and conducted enrichment cultures with both in situ hot spring water and defined media with varying acetate/NO3– ratios. Denitrification product profiles shifted systematically with temperature: NO2– dominated above 60 °C, NO2– and N2O at 55 °C, and N2 below 45 °C. Multiomics analyses revealed temperature-driven succession of dominant denitrifiers, with microorganisms affiliated with Thermus (>60 °C), Tepidimonas (55 °C), and Thauera/Uliginosibacterium (<45 °C). Denitrification core and accessory gene expressions showed temperature-specific patterns associated with intermediate formation. High expression of upstream core genes (e.g., narG) and limited expression of accessory genes in Thermus spp. promote incomplete denitrification at high temperatures, while low-temperature communities upregulated complementary pathways (e.g., nosRD with nosZ in Thauera spp.) for complete denitrification. Division of metabolic labor appears to be more important in denitrifying communities at high temperatures, where dominant denitrifiers perform incomplete denitrification and downstream intermediates are reduced by minor species (e.g., N2O reduction). These findings improve understanding of denitrification in thermally dynamic environments and reveal mechanisms underlying its temperature-dependent regulation."

This study aims to explore how MPs change the feeding of planktivorous silver carp. After exposure to MPs, the utilization efficiency of zooplankton by carp increased from 28.45% to 38.63–40.20%, while that of phytoplankton decreased from 50.64% to 40.47–43.32%. MPs did not cause changes in the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities that carp consumed but altered its gut microbiota, leading to increased abundance of genes encoding proteases but decreased carbohydrase genes. Gut metabolomics further showed corresponding metabolic changes especially with increased levels of l-tyrosine, citrulline, succinic acid, and propionic acid, which are significantly correlated with the isotopic signatures of carp utilizing zooplankton. Germ-free zebrafish transplanted with feces of MPs-exposed carp showed metabolic changes like those of carp, verifying that the gut microbiota mediated the effects induced by MPs, while silver carp transplanted with feces of MPs-exposed carp exhibited increased protease activity and enhanced zooplankton utilization efficiency, confirming that MPs could alter its food utilization via gut microbiota. Our findings fill a knowledge gap regarding the ecological risk of MPs to the feeding of planktivorous fish, with potential cascading effects on aquatic ecosystems."

However, estimating soil HONO emissions remains uncertain due to complex factors and limited data. Here, we present the first high-resolution soil HONO emissions in China from 2000 to 2020 by establishing a parametrization scheme that links emissions to soil moisture, soil temperature, and fertilization. Particularly, a data-driven model is constructed to capture the dynamic response of soil HONO emissions to soil moisture. The estimated soil HONO emissions in China for 2020 amount to 0.477 Tg N, with approximately 76% from croplands, 19% from forests, and 5% from grasslands. The spatial distribution of soil HONO emissions is notably influenced by soil moisture, with Xinjiang displaying the highest emission intensity among major agricultural regions due to its lower soil moisture. Over the past two decades, soil moisture has played a significant role in variations of soil HONO emissions, exhibiting strong irregular interannual fluctuations. Soil temperature-driven emissions have shown an increasing trend, while fertilizer-driven emissions have displayed a decreasing trend since reaching a peak in 2015.

While human urine is a nitrogen-rich resource, its complexity presents challenges, including chlorine-mediated ammonia oxidation and disinfection byproduct formation in the electrochemical process. In this study, we investigate these important issues in a stacked electrochemical system. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, and stopped-flow techniques were used to examine chlorine evolution and dissolved organic matter (DOM) transformation. Results showed minor ammonia loss due to chlorination because the Cl2-to-nitrogen ratio was significantly lower than the breakpoint ratio under anodic conditions (pH < 1.5). However, the generated active chlorine induced hydrogen abstraction and chlorine addition to unsaturated bonds, forming chlorinated DOM in the ammonia-receiving solution. This necessitated activated carbon post-treatment to ensure product quality. The electrochemical system demonstrated stable performance over 390 h with an ammonia removal rate of 24.4 g-N m–2 h–1 and consistent removal/recovery efficiencies of 80%. Further attention should be given to control of cathode scaling, anion exchange membrane fouling, and gas permeable membrane wetting.

Prevailing research indicates that intracellular or extracellular biomineralization enhances photosynthesis and carbon fixation, with limited attention to the potential and mechanisms of intracellular–extracellular synergy. Here, we report that electroactive cyanobacteria (Synechococcus, Syne) construct an intracellular–extracellular synergistic biohybrid system by biomineralizing Zn(II) into intracellular Zn(II)-OM and extracellular ZnO-OM. The photoexcited electrons from ZnO-OM transfer to the photosynthetic electron transport chain and promote photosynthesis in this biohybrid system. Meanwhile, Zn(II)-OM plays essential roles in photosynthesis and cellular metabolism, upregulating key genes involved in light-dependent reactions (e.g., PsbA, PsbD, PsaA, and PsaB) and light-independent reactions (e.g., rbcL and rbcS) to increase CO2 capture and fixation. Compared to untreated Syne cells, this biohybrid system, formed by treating Syne cells with Zn(II), exhibits a combined 120.9% increase in protein and lipid production efficiency. This work reveals the complexity of biomineralization both intracellularly and extracellularly, proposes the concept of an intracellular–extracellular synergistic biohybrid system that boosts photosynthetic carbon fixation, and provides comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of self-assembled hybrid systems."

Large influences from anthropogenic sources on health risks were observed with acellular and cellular assays. Anthropogenic biomass burning (BB) and natural dust events increased human pulmonary exposure to the oxidative potential (OPdose,T) of WS-PM10 by 209 and 47%, respectively, compared to regular periods. OPvDTT and ROSv results were positively correlated in anthropogenic-dominant samples, while showed no significant correlation in the remaining samples. As a result, the BB and dust event had higher and lower levels of cellular ROSv compared with the nonevent period, respectively. Source apportionment results suggest that specific organic contents (e.g., PAHs) had relatively low contents in samples less influenced by anthropogenic sources, possibly explaining the divergence in acellular and cellular results. Heavy metals were dominant contributors of OPvDTT throughout the campaign, and a Chelex method is recommended over a EDTA method for quantification of their summed OPvDTT."

 In crystals, defects are well-defined and crucial to their mechanical properties. In contrast, the structural disorder in glasses makes it challenging to directly identify defects at the particle level. However, low-frequency quasi-localised modes (QLMs) in glasses provide valuable insights, acting as mechanical defects associated with shear transformation zones and soft spots. Using molecular dynamics simulations of two-dimensional glasses, we identify a particle-level defect responsible for generating QLMs. The primary QLM originates from a “key-core” square of four particles vibrating in a two-in, two-out pattern, interpretable as a microscopic Eshelby inclusion. The motion of these particles induces nearby volumetric and far-field shear deformations, forming a characteristic four-leaf pattern. Despite the structural isotropy of the glass, these QLMs introduce notable mechanical anisotropy, particularly in nano-sized glasses. Crucially, pinning the key-core particles dramatically reduces shear modulus anisotropy, confirming their role as “localised particle-level defects.” This discovery deepens our understanding of glass defects and offers valuable insights for nanoscale glass applications.

Here, the authors show that cytosolic p62-positive bodies in aneuploid cells are enriched for mitochondrial precursor proteins, which in turn impairs mitochondrial function. 
 Aneuploidy, or aberrant chromosomal content, disrupts cellular proteostasis through altered expression of numerous proteins. Aneuploid cells accumulate SQSTM1/p62-positive cytosolic bodies, exhibit impaired protein folding, and show altered proteasomal and lysosomal activity. Here, we employ p62 proximity- and affinity-based proteomics to elucidate p62 interactors in aneuploid cells and observe an enrichment of mitochondrial proteins. Increased protein aggregation and colocalization of p62 with both novel interactors and mitochondrial proteins is further confirmed by microscopy. Compared to parental diploids, aneuploid cells suffer from mitochondrial defects, including perinuclearly-clustered mitochondrial networks, elevated reactive oxygen species levels, reduced mitochondrial DNA abundance, and impaired protein import, leading to cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Overexpression of heat shock proteins in aneuploid cells mitigates protein aggregation and decreases the colocalization of p62 with the mitochondrial protein TOMM20. Thus, proteotoxic stress caused by chromosome gains results in the sequestration of mitochondrial precursor proteins into cytosolic p62-bodies, thereby compromising mitochondrial function.

 Histologic variant (HV) subtypes of bladder cancer are clinically aggressive tumors that are more resistant to standard therapy compared to conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC).

 We experimentally investigate a superconducting circuit composed of two flux qubits ultrastrongly coupled to a common LC resonator. Owing to the large anharmonicity of the flux qubits, the system can be described well by a generalized Dicke Hamiltonian containing spin–spin interaction terms. In the experimentally measured spectrum, we observed two key phenomena. First, an avoided level crossing provides evidence of the exotic interaction that allows the simultaneous excitation of two artificial atoms by absorbing one photon from the resonator. Second, we identified a pronounced spectral asymmetry that is a clear signature of light-matter decoupling. This multi-atom ultrastrongly coupled system opens the door to studying novel processes for quantum optics and quantum-information tasks on a chip.

 Due to low availability of CO2 in aquatic environment, microalgae have evolved a CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM). It has long been thought that operation of CCM would suppress photorespiration by increasing the CO2 concentration at the Rubisco active site, but experimental evidence is scarce. To better explore the function of photorespiration in algae, we first characterized a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant defected in low-CO2 inducible 20 (LCI20) and show that LCI20 is a chloroplast-envelope glutamate/malate transporter playing a role in photorespiration. By monitoring growth and glycolate excretion in mutants deficient in either CCM or photorespiration, we conclude that: (i.) CCM induction does not depend on photorespiration, (ii.) glycolate excretion together with glycolate dehydrogenase down-regulation prevents the toxic accumulation of non-metabolized photorespiratory metabolites, and (iii.) photorespiration is active at low CO2 when the CCM is operational. This work provides a foundation for a better understanding of the carbon cycle in the ocean where significant glycolate concentrations have been found.

 Microtubules and nuclear transmembrane SUN1/2 proteins promote the mobility of DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and the misrepair of one-ended DSBs induced in BRCA1-deficient cells by Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). However, whether microtubules promote aberrant DSBs repair by altering the nuclear structure and whether the nuclear structure itself plays a role in these processes is still unclear. Here we show that microtubule-dependent DSBs mobility in BRCA1-deficient cells after PARPi treatment is associated with nuclear envelope (NE) invaginations. Furthermore, increasing NE invaginations by Lmna deletion or inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis increases DSBs mobility, chromosomal aberrations, and PARPi cytotoxicity in BRCA1-deficient cells. These findings reveal a functional connection between the NE and DSB repair and suggest that drugs increasing NE deformability will enhance PARPi therapy efficacy in BRCA1-deficient cancers.

 The sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the high-impact area of the North Atlantic prompts active convection over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), which consequently drives the Hadley Cell (HC) in the South Asian monsoon region to shift northward. This interaction mechanism stresses the “hub” effect of the QTP in the atmospheric energy and water cycle of the low- to mid–high latitude systems during the convergence of westerly and monsoon winds. The Rossby source, also famous as the “oscillation source,” formed in the upper troposphere by the SST variations in the high-impact area of the North Atlantic, is an essential “thermal driving source” for the interannual shifts in convection over the QTP. The meridional teleconnection wave train structure triggered by the warming (1991–2020)/cooling (1961–1990) of the SST in the high-impact area of the mid–high latitudes of the North Atlantic displays a reversed phase. The Rossby wave train, which spreads from the North Atlantic to the QTP during the high-impact sea surface warming phase in the North Atlantic, indicates a remarkable anticyclonic structure (strong divergence) in the high altitude (200 hPa) of the QTP, which favors the generation of active convective activity in the latter 30 years. By contrast, convective activity is blocked. During the two stages of 1961–1990 and 1991–2020, despite a significant interdecadal positive and negative phase reversal in the North Atlantic Multiyear Oscillation (AMO), the variance in the definition range between the AMO and the high-impact area of the North Atlantic led to substantial differences in the meridional teleconnection wave train structures and the corresponding effects. In addition, the latent heat emitted by the enhanced convective activity on the QTP during the sea surface warming phase in the high-impact area of the North Atlantic can strengthen the “heat pump” effect of the QTP, cause the northward shift of HC in the South Asian monsoon region, and spark the mutual feedback mechanism between the plateau convection and the HC in the South Asian monsoon region. According to these interdecadal response characteristics, this paper offers a comprehensive physical image that exhibits the mutual feedback between the convection over the QTP and the HC in the South Asian monsoon region, where the active convection is initiated by the SST warming in the high-impact area of the North Atlantic."

 Low-cost PM2.5 sensors have been deployed extensively for high spatio-temporal resolution air quality monitoring. However, environmental factors, especially relative humidity (RH), cause discrepancies for low-cost sensors when compared with regulatory-grade instruments. Developing methods of correcting or accounting for this RH discrepancy is therefore key to attaining data from low-cost air quality sensors, which can be used to monitor compliance with global air quality guidelines. Here, we developed a simple aerosol dryer and placed a pair of Plantower PMS7003 sensors before and after it, continuously monitoring the impact of drying on the reported particle mass concentrations. During the monitoring period, drying reduced the reported mass concentration for Brisbane’s PM2.5 by 25–40%. This measured drying effect was then used to calculate a real-time RH correction factor, enabling adjustment of particle mass concentrations reported by a sensor network, accounting for fluctuations in RH and the contribution of hygroscopic sources to ambient PM2.5."

 Numerous studies have explored global warming impact on tropical cyclones (TCs), but post-global warming TC activity remains poorly understood. This study analyzed 400-year evolution of TC characteristics in CO2 emission-driven ensemble experiments performed with the CESM2 model under net-zero (ZeroE) and negative CO2 emission (NegE) scenarios. Findings reveal a hemispheric asymmetry in TC track changes, with the Northern Hemisphere seeing a decrease and the Southern Hemisphere an increase. Under the ZeroE scenario, asymmetry persists for 300 years, while the NegE scenario mitigates it within 200 years. This asymmetry is influenced by changes in mid-level humidity, vertical wind shear, and sea surface temperature gradients. Unlike the TC frequency, maximum wind speeds and rainfall associated with landfalling TCs are enhanced globally in the ZeroE scenario, while alleviated in the NegE scenario. These results indicate that a carbon-neutral strategy is not sufficient and that more ambitious negative emission efforts are needed to mitigate TC impacts."

 This study investigates how the atmospheric mean state influences the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections with the North Atlantic-European (NAE) region, using ERA5 and CMIP5/CMIP6 models. By isolating the contributions of heating anomalies in the Niño 3.4 and Tropical Western-Eastern Indian Ocean (TWEIO) regions, we find that in November, the Niño 3.4 teleconnection dominates, projecting onto the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In December, the TWEIO teleconnection prevails, reinforcing the positive NAO via a zonal wavenumber-3 Rossby wave train originating from SouthEast Asia (SEA). Models that fail to simulate the December ENSO teleconnection with the NAE exhibit a weak Rossby wave source in SEA and overly strong subtropical Pacific and Atlantic jet streams, which trap Rossby waves at lower latitudes, affecting the remote atmospheric response over the NAE. This waveguide bias is likely driven by a cold bias in the northern Pacific and Atlantic, a common mean-state error in climate models."

 The Warm Arctic–Cold Eurasian pattern (WACE) is a pair of opposing surface air temperature anomalies over the polar region and the midlatitude Eurasian continent, which is usually associated with Arctic Sea ice melt and midlatitude extreme weather. The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere. Here we show evidence of an inter-hemispheric connection between SAM and WACE during boreal winter. A positive SAM leads to a negative WACE (and vice versa) 30–40 days later. This lagged remote influence of SAM is transmitted via a Rossby wave that crosses the equator in the eastern Pacific and tropical Atlantic. The ensuing WACE temperature pattern is then amplified by the greenhouse effect associated with the local humidity response. SAM also leads to a convection anomaly in the equatorial Atlantic which generates a Northern Hemisphere Rossby wave that reinforces WACE. The link between SAM and WACE revealed here indicates a dynamical origin for WACE. This long-distance teleconnection, and the lagged association between SAM and WACE may be relevant for subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions."

 Municipalities face growing challenges in independently managing frequent and severe external shocks, often constrained by limited relief supplies and inefficient allocation strategies. Here we develop and implement hybrid coordination strategies that integrate cross-regional and multi-entity resource allocation to enhance national flood resilience across China’s eight major river basins.

 It is still unclear about the emission reduction potential of different hydrogen production methods under different scenarios in China. Therefore, this study quantifies and predicts the life cycle emission reduction potential of hydrogen energy across Chinese cities. Here we quantify the life cycle carbon dioxide emissions of different hydrogen production methods in 5 selected pilot cities. Additionally, we evaluate the respective contributions of blue hydrogen and green hydrogen to emission reductions under different scenarios. The results show that the implementation of diversified hydrogen production methods results in reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, ranging from 65% to 96%, when compared to the utilization of single coal gasification for hydrogen generation by the year 2060. Blue hydrogen has the potential to achieve a emission reduction of 3.4 million tons by 2055. By 2050, green hydrogen is projected to constitute over 50% of the hydrogen supply market.

 Over recent decades the Amazon region has been exposed to large-scale land-use changes and global warming. How these changes affect Amazonia’s hydrological cycle remains unclear as meteorological data are scarce. We use tree ring oxygen isotope records to confirm that the Amazon hydrological cycle has intensified since 1980. Diverging isotopic trends from terra firme and floodplain trees from distinct sites (approximately 1000 km apart) in Western Amazon indicate rainfall amounts increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season at large-scale. Using the Rayleigh distillation model, we estimate that wet season rainfall increased by 15–22%, and dry season rainfall decreased by 8–13%. These diverging trends provide evidence, independent from existing climate records, that the seasonality of the hydrological cycle in the Amazon is increasing. Continuation of the observed trends will have a pervasive impact on Amazon forests and floodplain ecosystems, and strongly affect the livelihoods of the regional riverine communities.

 Repetitive optical observations from satellites are crucial for monitoring earth surface dynamics over time. However, optical satellite image time series is severely affected by frequent data gaps due to clouds and shadows. While synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides cloud-penetrating capabilities to complement missing optical data, recent advancements in time series reconstruction have shifted focus from incorporating single SAR image to exploiting SAR time series. However, current methods still struggle for challenging scenarios like highly dynamic surface, persistent data gaps, and exhibit poor resilience to inaccurate cloud masks. In this research, we approach the time series reconstruction problem from the perspective of conditional generation. We propose a multimodal diffusion framework termed RESTORE-DiT, which firstly promotes the sequence-level optical-SAR fusion through a diffusion framework. Specifically, date-matched SAR time series provide under-cloud surface dynamics to guide the denoising process of cloudy areas, and date information is embedded to account for irregular observation intervals and periodic patterns. Extensive experiments on three regions have shown the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. RESTORE-DiT outperforms comparison methods by 2.87 dB in PSNR and a 27.2 % reduction in RMSE on France site. SAR and date information together increase PSNR by 2.41 dB. The reconstructed optical image time series is verified to accurately reflect the crop growth condition and support for long-term vegetation observations. In addition, RESTORE-DiT can be easily extended to other conditional reconstruction or prediction tasks for arbitrary time series image data, thus facilitating spatiotemporal analysis research.

 Hexagonal Discrete Global Grid Systems (HDGGS) are spatial reference frameworks based on the spatial discretization of the Earth’s surface, dividing it into a network of uniform hexagonal cells. They have been widely applied in geospatial analysis and environmental science fields. However, the hexagonal cells are not perfectly uniform, exhibiting inevitable shape distortion and area deformation. This study proposes a neighbor distance standard deviation method to characterize the shape deformation of individual hexagonal cells, and introduces a global deformation index to assess overall distortion magnitude, thereby addressing the limitations of deformation analysis based solely on cell area and perimeter differences. Finally, we experimentally analyzed deformation characteristics across three hexagonal discrete global grid systems projection types: Fuller3H, Fuller4H, ISEA3H, ISEA4H, and Uber H3. The experimental results show that, compared with ISEA-projection-based HDGGS grids, the Fuller-projection-based HDGGS grids’ cell neighbor distance standard deviation, grid neighboring distance standard deviation, and global deformation index are 72.09 % to 76.12 %, 74.25 % to 81.92 %, and 72.25 % to 76.29 % of the former’s values, respectively. In comparison, the Gnomonic-projection-based HDGGS’s global deformation index is 55.28 % and 40.35 % of the previous two’s values, respectively. Therefore, Gnomonic-projection-based HDGGS demonstrates the least cell shape deformation and optimal equidistant characteristics. This study pioneers quantifying local distance consistency as standardized neighbor distance standard deviation, transcending conventional evaluation paradigms that solely rely on cell perimeter mean squared error or compactness. Experimental results confirm the method’s effectiveness in quantitatively evaluating HDGGS shape deformation, providing a decision-support tool for HDGGS projection type selection."

 Long-term, large-scale crop distribution mapping is crucial for agricultural policy and resource management. While high-resolution multispectral remote sensing has been widely used for crop type mapping, three major challenges remain: 1) spatiotemporal heterogeneity in cloud-free and shadow-free observations, 2) the lack of sufficient ground truth samples, and 3) limited generalization of identification models over extended periods. To address these challenges, this paper constructs a time-continuous sequence model that captures the unique feature pattern between the target-crop and non-target crops (referred to as the knowledge model). Specifically, a morphing approach was first employed to interpolate intermediate models between two pre-trained non-adjacent knowledge models. Then, a date-continuous sequence model that estimate the probabilistic of growth patterns of target crop was generated. This date-continuous sequence model mitigates spatiotemporal heterogeneity issues at the pixel level across large regions. Additionally, crop-specific knowledge model addresses sample scarcity and enhances generalization during long-term applications. The method was test using a long-term cotton mapping task (2000, 2005–2023) in Xinjiang, China. The results demonstrate that: 1) The sequence of knowledge model can effectively capture feature differences between cotton and non-cotton throughout the growing period, resulting in knowledge feature has a higher separability compared to original spectral and vegetation index features; 2) Segmenting knowledge features with Unet enables effective mapping cotton and non-cotton without ground samples. The estimated planting area from our mapping results shows excellent consistency with official statistics (R2 = 0.97). The correlation between our 2018–2021 results and previously published data reached 0.8, 0.88, 0.88, and 0.89. 3). The stable and excellent mapping accuracy proves that resonation of connectivity and reachability in parameter space between two networks with identical architecture, and model morphing is a feasible way to overcome the spatial–temporal heterogeneity in valid observations in large regions."

However, most of previous studies mainly focused on estimating single air pollutant concentration, ignoring the interactions and dependencies between different air pollutants. Therefore, we proposed a Multiple Pollutants simultaneous estimation method based on Attention mechanism augmented Random Forest model (MPA-RF), including PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, CO and SO2. Specifically, self-attention mechanism was incorporated with the multi-output random forest first to emphasize pertinent features in inputs during model training.

Satellite observations from Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in three major urban agglomerations in China were extracted to demonstrate the model performance using sample- and site-based cross-validation schemes. Results elucidate that the proposed model is capable of deriving simultaneous estimations of six air pollutants with high accuracy, R2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.93. Benefiting from the consideration of interactions and dependencies between different air pollutants, the proposed model outperforms other single-task contrast models with an R2 improvement ranging from 9% to 26%.

 This study uses near-decade-long OCO-2 satellite measurements of column-averaged dry-air carbon dioxide (CO2) mole fraction (XCO2) to understand CO2 dynamics across the Arabian Peninsula (AP). The XCO2 over the AP exhibits strong seasonality, with considerably high and low concentrations during spring and autumn, respectively. Local CO2 fluxes, predominantly from anthropogenic sources, do not display seasonal variations, resulting in minimal impact on the seasonal XCO2 cycle across the AP. Analyses of CarbonTracker model outputs reveal a considerable north-to-south transport of CO2, mainly from Europe and adjacent areas and confined between the low and middle levels of the atmosphere. The seasonal XCO2 cycle observed in the AP clearly replicates the seasonality of this transport pattern. Furthermore, a cross-correlation analysis shows a lag of approximately 1 month in CO2 concentrations between Europe and the AP, with the former preceding the latter. The transport of CO2 from Europe is influenced by considerable variations in local fluxes across the Europe. From winter to early spring, net positive CO2 fluxes occur due to high respiration, increasing local CO2 levels. Conversely, from summer to early autumn, net negative fluxes arise from enhanced uptake, reducing local CO2 concentrations. These concentrations of CO2 are subsequently transported to the AP, driven by synoptic-scale systems (shamal winds) moving toward the region.The evolution of El Niño conditions considerably amplifies the XCO2 levels over the AP by up to approximately 1 ppm. Notably, during the peak phase of the recent 2015–2016 El Niño, we noted strongly positive anomalies over the southern latitudes, which subsequently migrated to the AP."

 Ground-level ozone (O3) concentrations in Shandong Province have exhibited a dynamic trend, characterized by an initial decline followed by a rebound. To investigate the drivers of these changes, we combined satellite-derived formaldehyde-to-nitrogen dioxide ratios (HCHO/NO2) with ground-based O3 measurements to establish a diagnostic threshold for O3 formation sensitivity. Results reveal a transition from NOx-limited/transitional regimes to VOC-limited regimes from 2019 to 2021, followed by a gradual reversal to transitional regimes from 2021 to 2023. Satellite observations corroborate this trend, showing a rebound in HCHO columns alongside a sharp decline in NO2 columns between 2019 and 2023. These findings highlight that while stringent NOx emission controls have succeeded in reducing NO2 levels over the past five years, insufficient VOC mitigation has enabled O3 resurgence. During COVID-19 lockdowns, we found that abrupt NOx reductions did not shift Shandong to NOx-limited regimes. Unbalanced emission reductions lead to O3 increases, with at least 60 % VOC reductions required to offset O3 rises. This suggests that future measures (e.g., transport electrification) may be insufficient without synergistic VOC/NOx control."

Utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data, this study investigates stratosphere-troposphere coupling mechanisms through dynamic and thermodynamic analyses with a focus on tropopause folds dynamics that drove this extreme event. The results demonstrate that the 26 December 2020 Arctic sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event triggered a zonal wind reversal in early January and downward-propagating geopotential height and temperature anomalies that displaced the polar vortex toward Eastern China, inducing southward high-potential vorticity (PV) air mass intrusion via tropopause folds. Diagnostic analysis using the 3D labeling methods revealed a significant rise in tropopause folds frequency preceding the cold wave, culminating in deep folding events as high-PV air masses penetrated the midlatitude troposphere down to 700 hPa while the sloping 315 K isentropic surface facilitated southward cold stratospheric air transport and enhanced convective development through fold intensification. Thermodynamic analysis revealed marked instability within and beneath the dry intrusion zone characterized by negative Brunt-Väisälä frequency squared (N2) and Richardson numbers <0.25, where stratified instability and turbulence generation correlated positively with fold intensity, and the coupling of tropopause folds intrusions with mid-high latitude cyclonic ascent and low-latitude anticyclonic descent amplified vertical convection-driven cold surge intensification.

 Accurate quantitative assessment of biomass burning (BB) aerosol radiative effects (BBARE) in the North China Plain is a key scientific issue in regional aerosol radiative effects research. However, there is currently a lack of comparative analysis between BBARE based on observation and model simulations of BBARE, especially with regard to the differences between the two BBARE estimates in urban-rural differences. This study focuses on 10 typical BB events that affected Beijing during July, September and October 2014 in the North China Plain, and quantifies the BBARE at various radiation stations using both observational data-based machine learning approach and the WRF-Chem model. Based on the quantitative results, the BBARE obtained through the two methods was analysed in direct comparison and in terms of urban-rural differences. Direct comparison results indicate that the BBARE simulated by WRF-Chem shows an overall underestimation compared to the results based on observations. In terms of urban-rural differences in BBARE, observation-based BBARE was on average 91.28 % lower in urban stations than in rural stations, while model-simulated BBARE showed the opposite urban-rural difference (the urban stations' BBARE was on average 38.52 % higher than rural stations). This urban-rural difference in BBARE based on observations is due to the fact that urban SSR is more severely affected by background aerosols, resulting in limited changes in SSR caused by additional BB aerosols. However, the model simulation only considers the reduction in SSR caused by increased BB aerosols, neglecting the influence of pre-existing aerosol. By identifying these disparities, this study will help to enhance the accuracy of model simulations of BBARE."

This study leverages data from 131 global flux stations across various climate and landcover types to assess the NP method's accuracy, focusing on extreme scenarios spanning from dry to wet and from hot to cold. Our results indicate substantial variability, with absolute errors ranging from −41.7 to 26.8 W/m2 and relative errors between 0.4 % and 98.1 %. The NP method tends to overestimate ET in hot, dry conditions, and underestimate in cold, wet conditions, with performance declining under extremes. Cold climates exhibit the largest biases, with particularly severe underestimation in extreme wet (−54.5 W/m2) and cold (−69.2 W/m2) conditions. Closed shrublands demonstrate the largest overestimation (73.2 W/m2) in extreme hot conditions. Across stations, three error patterns are observed: (i) overestimation in dry-hot regions caused by a high difference between equilibrium and actual ET, (ii) underestimation in humid regions resulting from a low difference, and (iii) underestimation in cold regions arising from large surface-air temperature gradients, causing an excessive integral term resulting in overcorrection. These errors could be amplified under extreme conditions, reducing model performance and highlighting the NP method's sensitivity to hydroclimatic extremes while offering insights for improving its accuracy and robustness."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108291,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文关注于利用遥感技术改进气溶胶的反演算法，特别是针对中国风云三号D星搭载的中分辨率光谱成像仪（MERSI）。论文提出了一种新的算法（MERSI DT_UP），该算法通过结合城市百分比和植被指数来参数化地表反射率模型，从而提高在城市地区气溶胶反演的准确性。研究结果表明，改进后的算法相较于原始算法，在气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）的反演精度上有显著提升，尤其是在不同城市化程度的区域。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它直接关系到利用卫星观测数据进行空气质量监测和大气成分分析。,"['aerosol retrieval', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'surface reflectance', 'urban areas', 'vegetation index', 'MERSI', 'AERONET']",Weiqian Ji;Leiku Yang;Xin Pei;Huan Liu;Yidan Si;Kaimin Sun;Yizhe Fan;Ping Zhang;Xiaoqian Cheng;Xiaofeng Lu,Improving aerosol retrieval from FY-3D/MERSI by parameterizing a binary quadratic spectral surface reflectance model with urban percentage and vegetation index,"•Developed the MERSI DT_UP algorithm using a binary quadratic surface reflectance model. •Conducted global evaluations of MERSI DT and MERSI DT_UP AODs against AERONET observations. •Demonstrated superior performance of MERSI DT_UP retrievals compared to original retrievals. 
 The Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) Dark Target (DT) algorithm, adapted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) DT algorithm, demonstrated aerosol retrieval performance similar to that of MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1) DT products. However, discrepancies arose in urban areas, where MERSI retrievals tended to exhibit noticeable positive biases, primarily due to the inadequate representation of urban surface reflectance. To address this issue, this study developed an enhanced algorithm by parameterizing a binary quadratic spectral surface reflectance model using urban percentage (UP) and vegetation index, named the MERSI DT_UP algorithm. Global validation against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements showed that MERSI DT_UP retrievals in 2019 exhibited greater accuracy than MERSI DT retrievals. The correlation coefficient between satellite retrievals and AERONET for MERSI DT_UP (R = 0.882) was higher than that for MERSI DT (R = 0.875), and the mean bias was reduced to −0.001 from 0.018. Additionally, the percentage of matchups falling within the expected error envelope (within EE%) of ± (0.05 + 0.2τ) increased by 1.5 %. Across different urbanization levels, MERSI DT_UP retrievals showed significant reductions in mean biases (ranging from 0.003 to 0.217) and notable increases in within EE% (ranging from 2.2 % to 49.3 %) compared to original results. Moreover, improvements were also observed on moderately vegetated and moderately bright surfaces, as demonstrated by the error dependence analysis. The proposed surface reflectance model supports the algorithm development for MERSI and holds potential for application to other sensors."
