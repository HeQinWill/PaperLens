Prepositioning via CD4 binding results in high neutralization breadth and potency, and experiments in HIV infected humanized male mice show reduction of viral load. 
 Antibodies targeting the highly conserved prehairpin intermediate (PHI) of class I viral membrane-fusion proteins are generally weakly neutralizing and are not considered viable therapeutic agents. We previously demonstrated that antibodies targeting the gp41 N-heptad repeat (NHR), which is transiently exposed in the HIV-1 PHI, exhibit enhanced broad neutralization in cells expressing the Fc receptor, FcγRI. To enhance neutralization in cells lacking FcγRI, we here develop a bispecific antibody (bsAb) by fusing an NHR-targeting antibody to an antibody against CD4, the HIV-1 receptor on T cells. The bsAb provides a 5000-fold neutralization enhancement and shows unprecedented neutralization breadth compared to existing broadly neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the bsAb reduces viral load in HIV-1-infected humanized male mice, and viral envelope sequencing under bsAb pressure revealed an NHR mutation that potentially impairs viral fitness. These findings validate the NHR as a potential HIV-1 therapeutic target, setting the stage for a new class of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here the authors engineer a bispecific antibody (Ab) for HIV-1 by combining a gp41 N-heptad repeat targeting Ab with a CD4 binding Ab. Prepositioning via CD4 binding results in high neutralization breadth and potency, and experiments in HIV infected humanized male mice show reduction of viral load."

 Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine and a common cause of chronic diarrhea in older adults. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of colonic mucosal tissue to build a cellular and molecular model for MC. Our results show that in MC, there is a substantial expansion of tissue CD8+ T cells, likely arising from local expansion following T cell receptor engagement. Within the T cell compartment, MC is characterized by a shift in CD8 tissue-resident memory T cells towards a highly cytotoxic and inflammatory phenotype and expansion of CD4+ T regulatory cells. These results provide insight into inflammatory cytokines shaping MC pathogenesis and highlight notable similarities and differences with other immune-mediated intestinal diseases, including a common upregulation of IL26 and an MC-specific upregulation of IL10. These data help identify targets against enteric T cell subsets as an effective strategy for treatment of MC. Microscopic colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine.

Here, the authors use optical neuroimaging in mice and humans to show that electroconvulsive therapy elicits a second brain event after seizure—spreading depolarization—a previously hidden phenomenon that may help to understand and optimize this treatment. 
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a fast-acting, highly effective, and safe treatment for medication-resistant depression. Historically, the clinical benefits of ECT have been attributed to generating a controlled seizure; however, the underlying neurobiology is understudied and unresolved. Using optical neuroimaging of neural activity and hemodynamics in a mouse model of ECT, we demonstrated that a second brain event follows seizure: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD). We found that ECT pulse parameters and electrode configuration directly shaped the wave dynamics of seizure and subsequent CSD. To translate these findings to human patients, we used non-invasive diffuse optical monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during routine ECT treatments. We observed that human brains reliably generate hyperemic waves after ECT seizure which are highly consistent with CSD. These results challenge a long-held assumption that seizure is the primary outcome of ECT and point to new opportunities for optimizing ECT stimulation parameters and treatment outcomes. The underlying mechanism of electroconvulsive therapy remains not fully understood.

Here the authors use metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics data from 79 children to identify potential omics signatures that correlate with different extent and nature of inflammation to provide insights into the development of future treatments. 
 Factors governing the clinical trajectory of Plasmodium falciparum infection remain an important area of investigation. Here we present transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses comparing clinical subtypes of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria to matched controls with uncomplicated disease in 79 children from Mali. MMP8, IL1R2, and ARG1 transcription is higher across cerebral malaria, severe malarial anemia, and concurrent cerebral malaria and severe malarial anemia, indicating a shared inflammatory signature. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 is the most upregulated protein in cerebral malaria, which along with elevated MMP8 and MMP9 transcription, underscores the importance of the metalloproteinase pathway in central nervous system pathophysiology. L-arginine metabolites are decreased in cerebral malaria, which coupled with increased ARG1 transcription suggests a putative mechanism impairing cerebral vasodilation. Using multi-omics approaches, we thus describe the inflammatory cascade in severe malaria syndromes, and identify potential therapeutic targets and biological markers.

 The frustrated Fe3Sn2 magnet is technologically attractive due to its extreme-temperature skyrmion stability, large topological Hall effect, and current-induced helicity switching attributed to a self-induced spin-torque. Here, we present a current-driven skyrmion resonance technique excited by self-induced spin-torque in Fe3Sn2. The dynamics are probed optically in a time-resolved measurement enabling us to distinguish between the excited modes.

 Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells results in type 1 diabetes (T1D), with pancreatic immune infiltrate representing a key feature in this process. However, characterization of the immunological processes occurring in human pancreatic lymphatic tissues is lacking. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study of immune cells from pancreatic, mesenteric, and splenic lymphatic tissues of non-diabetic control (ND), β cell autoantibody-positive non-diabetic (AAb+), and T1D donors using flow cytometry and CITEseq. Compared to ND pancreas-draining lymph nodes (pLN), AAb+ and T1D donor pLNs display decreased CD4+ Treg and increased stem-like CD8+ T cell signatures, while only T1D donor pLNs exhibit naive T cell and NK cell differentiation. Mesenteric LNs have modulations only in CD4+ Tregs and naive cells, while splenocytes lack these perturbations. Further, T cell expression of activation markers and IL7 receptor correlate with T1D genetic risk. These results demonstrate tissue-restricted immune changes occur before and after T1D onset.

 The active site of a solid catalyst varies sensitively with the catalyzed reaction. Herein, using experimentally measured elementary surface reaction kinetics of CO2 or CO hydrogenation reactions over a ZnO-ZrO2 catalyst under working conditions in combinations with comprehensive structural characterizations and theoretical simulations, we unveil the distinctly different active sites in catalyzing the CO2 or CO hydrogenation to methanol reaction. Zn2+ cations with different local environments are present on the ZnO-ZrO2 surface, including Zn1 single atoms exclusively with a Zn-O-Zr local structure and Znn clusters with both Zn-O-Zr and Zn-O-Zn local structures. The -Zr-O-Zr- structure bonded to the Znn clusters is more easily to be reduced than that bonded to the Zn1 single atoms. The Zn1-single atom (-Zr-O-Zn-O-Zr-) is the active site for catalyzing the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction, whereas the Znn cluster bonded to an in situ formed -Zr-Vo-Zr- structure (-Zn-O-Zn(-O-Zr-Vo-Zr-)-O-Zr-) is the active site for catalyzing the CO hydrogenation to methanol reaction.

 Large uncertainties still exist in the estimation of black carbon (BC) radiative forcing due to incomplete representation of BC optical properties. To address this, this study employed the AI-based nonspherical aerosol optical scheme (AI-NAOS), coupled with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6), to comprehensively estimate the optical properties of the aging BC and its direct radiative effect (DRE). The AI-NAOS was obtained from a database of accurate optical properties of encapsulated fractal aggregates computed from the invariant imbedding T-matrix method (IITM). With this scheme, the aging progress of BC in the CAM6 can be explicitly resolved by the volume fraction and the optical properties can be efficiently inferred from the deep neural network (DNN) in real time. Based on decadal-long simulations from 2010 to 2020, the BC DRE of fractal aggregates was estimated to be +0.3 w/m2 globally and +1.3 w/m2 over East Asia, representing decreases of 40.0% and 38.1%, respectively, compared to spherical assumptions. Additionally, an idealized scenario was considered where BC quantities were increased tenfold. In this scenario, the aging process was minimized due to insufficient hygroscopic aerosols for encapsulating BC aerosols. Compared to the normal scenario, the incremental ratio of radiative effects based on the fractal aggregate model was 11.1 globally and 9.1 over East Asia, whereas it was 7.6 globally and 5.3 over East Asia based on spherical assumptions. These results indicate that, compared to spherical assumptions, stronger enhancement of BC DRE could be produced using more realistic models in scenarios with higher BC emission. Whether the radiative effect is reduced or enhanced using realistic particle models depend on the competing roles of particle nonsphericity and encapsulation (lensing effect) in influencing BC absorption capabilities."

 Megacities, with their unique land cover and high pollutant emissions, may influence the outer rainband of approaching typhoons. Here we demonstrate, through numerical simulations and sensitivity experiments, that the Pearl River Delta megacity enhanced convection and precipitation during Typhoon Nida in 2016 offering insights into how urbanization influences precipitation processes. We find that the impact of urban land and anthropogenic heat is more pronounced than that of anthropogenic aerosols. Urban land cover and anthropogenic heat enhance, respectively, surface friction and exacerbate the heat island, driving low-level convergence and enhancing the warm-rain process. In contrast, aerosols primarily enhance the cloud-condensation nuclei concentration and strengthen ice-phase processes. This study underscores the critical importance of accounting for both urban land effects and human activities (anthropogenic heat and aerosol emissions) in understanding and predicting the impact of megacities on urban precipitation.

 The anthropogenic fingerprint has been detectable in observed global climate change for decades, yet it is still difficult to detect at the regional scale beyond temperature due to the presence of large internal variability and modeling and observational uncertainties. Here we demonstrate regional optimal fingerprinting of long-term fire weather trends in western North America, leveraging large ensembles of high resolution, atmosphere-only climate models to adequately sample internal variability. Considering the full spatiotemporal response to thermodynamic and dynamic climate change, we find that anthropogenic forcings have contributed 81–188% of the region’s observed increasing linear trend in fire weather over the last 50+ years. The natural fingerprint, which contains inter-annual and decadal variability, is also robustly detected. We detect the anthropogenic fingerprint in relevant meteorological variables – temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity – and link model differences in fire weather response to differences in simulated precipitation and relative humidity responses.

 High-resolution urban air temperatures are indispensable for analysing excess mortality during heatwaves. As a crucial method for obtaining high-resolution data, multi-source data integration has been widely used in urban temperature estimations. However, current research predominantly focuses solely on integrating official weather station observations, satellite products, and reanalysis datasets. Despite the significant cooling effect of rainfall on air temperatures, no studies have explored the contribution of rainfall-related variables to high-resolution air temperature estimations. Additionally, due to the scarcity of official weather stations, quantifying the impact of station density remains an underexplored research direction. To tackle these challenges, we innovatively integrated satellite products, reanalysis datasets, and weather radar data with air temperature observations from crowdsourced weather stations. Using genetic programming, we developed statistical downscaling models to estimate high spatiotemporal resolution (1-km, hourly) air temperatures in London during the summers of 2019 and 2022. The models achieved RMSEs of 1.694 °C (2019) and 1.785 °C (2022), R-squared values of 0.867 and 0.862, and MAEs of 1.276 °C and 1.278 °C, respectively. Notably, the accuracy of the models was found to improve with increased weather station density, particularly when the density was below 0.5 stations per 100 km2. Moreover, high-resolution rainfall observations significantly impacted the accuracy of air temperature estimations, second only to elevation, highlighting the potential of integrating radar data. These findings can provide valuable insights for scholars aiming to improve data integration for enhancing urban air temperature estimations."

 Landslides are one of the major geohazards causing significant economic damage and loss of life, with impacts expected to increase due to climate change. Landslide inventory maps (LIMs) are essential for risk management and reduction, but they usually remain an overlooked issue, especially over very large areas, i.e. at a regional or national level. Nowadays, extensive interferometric satellite radar data with wide area coverage are profitably available, but their potential can be not fully exploited due to the challenge of managing them. In this context, we used space-borne advanced Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data at a national scale, in order to create a useful database of active slope instability movement areas to rely on where the landslide inventory map is missing or largely incomplete. Specifically, we provide insights into a new approach, proposing a national-scale method that combines Machine Learning (ML) and clustering tools, which are crucial to manage a huge amount of data. The proposed methodology has been applied to Great Britain. The use of a ML algorithm, specifically Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) for noise filtering, has allowed the InSAR dataset to be reduced from approximately 6.5 million points to about 3.8 million points per component. Thus, implementing ML along with Slope Units for geomorphological reliability, and tools for identifying and classifying active deformation areas yields an InSAR landslide inventory map. Through this process, 336,557 Slope Units have been classified; of these, 5% show discrepancies between landslide inventory and InSAR data. Identifying these areas, along with those classified as landslides by both datasets, is crucial for risk management as it highlights areas that require closer inspections."

 Elucidating the sources and formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is essential to access its impact on air quality and climate, yet the seasonal variations of SOA formation from ambient air remain poorly constrained. In this study, in-situ SOA formation from ambient air at a suburban site in Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta of eastern China during summer and winter was investigated using an oxidation flow reactor (OFR), with equivalent photochemical age in the OFR ranging from several hours to 3 weeks. Substantially distinct SOA mass enhancements and precursor characteristics were observed during these two seasons. In summer, the average OH exposure-dependent OA enhancements were ∼0.77–2.64 μg m−3, much higher than ∼0.24 μg m−3 in winter. The known SOA precursors contributed approximately 31 % and 18 % of the measured SOA during summer daytime and nighttime and 25 % and 89 % during winter daytime and nighttime, respectively. In summer, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) contributed to approximately 56 % of the estimated SOA during the daytime while aromatics accounted for 76 % at night. By contrast, C6-C9 aromatics were the dominant SOA precursors during the daytime and nighttime in winter. The unexplained SOA may be attributed to the unmeasured semi-volatile and intermediate volatile organic compounds (S/IVOCs) and precursors emitted from volatile chemical products (VCPs). This study highlights the significant seasonal differences in SOA formation potential in suburban eastern China."

 Anthropogenic influence have led to an increase in the frequency of compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) globally under the background of global warming. However, there is limited research on the extent of anthropogenic influence on the spatial extent of CDHEs. Our analysis, focusing on the changes in the affected area of CDHEs across the global land during the warm season from 1961 to 2013, indicates an increasing trend in both hemispheres and six continents, with the most obviously increases observed in the Northern Hemisphere (15.8 %/53 yr), Asia (16 %/53 yr), and Africa (14 %/53 yr). Using the optimal fingerprinting method for detection and attribution analysis, we found that the anthropogenic signal was robustly detected in all regions except Oceania. The greenhouse gases emission played a major role in the observed increasing trends in all regions except Oceania. Furthermore, we conducted an event attribution analysis for the 2022–like CDHEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere, finding that nearly 95 %, 91 %, and 89 % of the trends in the Northern Hemisphere, Asia, and Europe, respectively, could be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Using the attribution result, we constrained projections of spatial extent of CDHEs under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 emission scenarios. The constrained projections show a smaller increasing magnitude compared to the raw projections (except for Asia), with the largest differences observed in South America in the Southern Hemisphere. By 2100, the CDHEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere are projected to reach 43 % and 68 % under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios, respectively. Asia faces the most widespread impact from CHDEs, with more than 93 % under the SSP5–8.5 scenario and 56 % under the SSP2–4.5 scenario. Therefore, reducing greenhouse gas emissions has huge benefits for better mitigating the impacts of CDHEs across the global land."

Abel,A stratocumulus to cumulus transition during a cold-air outbreak: The role of aerosols,"•Mesoscale simulations using prognostic cloud droplets successfully simulate the SCT. •The sectional scheme simulates the aerosol ultra-clean layer after the breakup. •The modal scheme simulates more accurately the cloud cover and the LWP. •Sea salt particles enhance liquid precipitation in the sectional scheme. 
 Cold air outbreaks (CAOs) are phenomena that occur across high latitudes during winter months and favor the development of extensive boundary layer clouds. As the boundary layer evolves, changes in cloud morphology often result in a stratocumulus to cumulus transition (SCT). The onset of precipitation is considered to be a key factor that leads to the break-up of the stratocumulus deck. In this modeling study we investigate the additional role that aerosols have on the SCT within a CAO event in the North Atlantic, by using prognostic fields for both aerosols and cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd). By using two chemical/aerosol schemes we assess and quantify the impact of aerosols on the SCT evolution. Our results indicate that the aerosol load and its chemical composition affect the timing of precipitation initiation and its magnitude and thus the break-up. However, the two schemes reveal contradictory results, which are mainly associated with different aerosol size and chemical composition partitioning between modes and bins. The simulations with the aerosol scheme, which considers the modal approach, show that the reduction of Nd across the SCT is driven by changes in the cloud liquid water content, the sulfate availability, and the fine sea-spray availability in the cumulus region, which suppresses sulfate activation. The Nd decreases mostly follow the decrease in accumulation-mode aerosols. For the scheme that considers the sectional approach, both the stratiform and the cumulus clouds appear sensitive to new particles formation and their competition for water. However, in the cumulus region, the higher updrafts and the greater availability of fine sea salt particles become critical for the activation of small particles. New particle formation and background sulfate concentrations are critical in this pristine environment, while sea salt particles have a significant impact on SCT in both sets of simulations."
