10.1029/2024GL111104,False,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了美国中部地区夏季极端降水强度与当地温度的关系，以及中尺度对流系统（MCS）对极端降水强度缩放的贡献。研究发现，在较低温度下，MCS风暴是极端降水的主要贡献者，且极端降水强度随温度升高而增加。但在较高温度下，MCS风暴的贡献减少，非MCS风暴成为主导，导致极端降水强度随温度升高而降低，因为非MCS风暴的降雨强度较弱。该研究强调了不同类型风暴在影响极端降水强度缩放关系中的重要作用。该论文主要关注降水，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关联不大。,"['extreme precipitation', 'temperature scaling', 'mesoscale convective systems (MCSs)', 'storm types', 'rainfall intensity']",Huancui Hu;L. Ruby Leung;Xiaoming Sun;Guiling Wang,"The Scaling of MCS, Non‐MCS, and Total Extreme Precipitation With Temperature Over the Central United States","While extreme precipitation is expected to increase in a warming climate, its scaling with temperature at weather timescales often produces puzzling results. Here, we focus on the summer months over the central U.S. to investigate the scaling of extreme precipitation intensity (EPI) with local temperature and determine the contribution of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) to the EPI scaling. Using an observational data set that differentiates precipitation associated with MCS and non‐MCS storms, we find that MCS storms contribute to 70% of EPI samples at temperatures lower than 298 K where EPI increases with temperature. However, at temperatures of 298–305 K, MCSs' contribution to EPI decreases as the predominant storm type shifts from MCS to non‐MCS storms, causing EPI to decrease with temperature due to the weaker rainfall intensity associated with non‐MCS storms compared with MCS storms. Our findings underscore the important role of different storm types in affecting the EPI scaling relationships."

The findings indicate that emissions from salt lakes may pose risks to glaciers and freshwater resources, emphasizing the significance of this contribution, which should not be overlooked.






The Qaidam Basin in the Northeastern Qinghai‐Xizang Plateau, characterized by its numerous salt lakes and fragile ecosystem, is increasingly impacted by salt dust emissions. To evaluate the impact of salt dust on environment, monthly dust samples were collected from six monitoring stations between January 2020 and March 2023 and analyzed for dust and salt dust deposition flux (DF), mineral composition, water‐soluble ions, trace elements, and carbonaceous content. The study used backward trajectory modeling, Pearson correlation, enrichment factor (EF) analysis, and positive matrix factorization (PMF) to quantify salt lake contributions to atmospheric dust. Results revealed that halite and gypsum content ranged from 0 to 47 wt%, with salt dust deposition flux (SDF) varying between 0 and 2.54 g/m2·30d. Key soluble ions included non‐playa salt sulfate (nps‐SO42−), playa salt chloride (ps‐Cl−), and sodium (ps‐Na+). Trace elements such as iron, aluminum, silicon, and titanium originated from both natural and anthropogenic sources. The organic carbon to element carbon (OC/EC) ratio and PMF model pointed to vehicle emissions, coal combustion, and biomass burning as major pollution sources, particularly in urban areas. PMF analysis showed that salt lakes contributed 5.23%–29.76% of total dust mass, aligning with changes in soluble ion and halite gypsum content. As the region is a key source of river systems, the soluble salts in dust pose risks to glaciers and freshwater resources. These findings highlight the substantial impact of inland salt aerosols in arid inland regions, emphasizing that their contribution to atmospheric processes is significant and should not be overlooked."

The main drivers of both events are increasing mountaintop stability and the mountain wave activity exhibiting a hydraulic jump and near‐surface critical layer. Another important finding is ascent of the downslope flows over the turbulent adiabatic layers at the coastal regions. In both events, the strong downslope flow warms and dries the air descending the southern slopes of the SYM adiabatically generating a deepening adiabatic layer that is 0.4 to as much as 1 km deep during peak Sundowner intensity over the coastal regions. This layer, exhibiting turbulence within and atop, is characterized with the strong downslope flow atop with much weaker, and at times, reversed flow beneath over the coastal regions. This flow structure, along with regions of turbulence within and atop the adiabatic layer, is indicative of a mountain lee‐wave rotor. Coastal locations in both events remain relatively unaffected. Further investigations are needed to determine whether or not this is consistent across all Sundowner events observed during the SWEX project and whether turbulence helps diffuse or accelerate the flows."

Pugh,Understanding Europe's Forest Harvesting Regimes,"European forests are being shaped by active human use and management, and by harvesting of wood in particular. Yet, our understanding of how forests are harvested across Europe is limited, as the real harvest regimes are not well described by currently available data. Here, we analyse recent harvests, as observed in permanent plots of forest inventories in 11 European countries, totaling to 182,649 plots and covering all major forest types. We (a) characterize harvest regimes through the frequency and intensity of harvest events spatially across Europe, and (b) build models for the probability and intensity of harvest events at the plot‐level and examine the links to potential drivers of harvest, including the pre‐harvest forest structure and composition, climatic, topographic and socio‐economic factors, and past natural disturbances. The results revealed notable variation in harvest regimes across Europe, ranging from high‐frequency and low‐intensity harvests in eastern Central Europe to low‐frequency and high‐intensity harvests in the north, with different strategies emerging in regions with similar total harvest rates. The harvest regimes were strongly driven by country‐level variation, emphasizing the role of national‐level factors. Pre‐harvest forest properties were important drivers for the intensity of harvest, whereas the probability of harvest was more related to socio‐economic factors and natural disturbances. The presented quantification of the forest harvesting regimes provides much needed detail in our understanding of the contemporary forest management practices in Europe, providing a baseline against which to assess future changes in management and strengthening the knowledge‐base for decision‐making on European level."

Moore,Empirical Models of Shallow Groundwater and Multi‐Hazard Flood Forecasts as Sea‐Levels Rise,"Knowledge of coastal hydrogeology and hazards as groundwater responds to sea‐level rise (SLR) can be improved through installation of shallow groundwater monitoring piezometers and continuous observations. Interpolation of site data enables mapping of the present‐day state of groundwater elevation, depth to groundwater (DTW), their temporal statistical variation, and differing spatial responses to tides and rainfall. Future DTW and its variability can be projected under increments of SLR, with assumptions and caveats, to show where and when episodic and/or permanent inundation can be expected. This methodology is outlined in a case study of Dunedin, New Zealand, which enabled comparison of rising groundwater's contribution to pluvial flooding and groundwater emergence with coastal inundation. Changes in relative land exposure with SLR shows evolution in flood hazard from current pluvial‐dominated events, into “flooding from below” and groundwater emergence, in advance of any overland coastal inundation. Dunedin exemplifies how groundwater transfers effects of SLR surprisingly far inland, but the lowest‐lying or shoreline‐proximal suburbs are not necessarily the most vulnerable. Unlike coastal inundation, rising groundwater is unconstrained by protective topography and presents as a creeping hazard, or contributor to hazards such as pluvial flooding, which can be widespread, occurring already and difficult to defend against. The empirical models contain assumptions and uncertainties important to the veracity of results and application. While conservative (“risk averse”) and a compromise from computationally expensive numerical solutions, their value is in providing the spatial and temporal precision needed for multi‐source hazard assessment and holistic adaptive planning."

Here, the authors investigate CDK2-dependancy and response to CDK2 inhibition across different cancers, identifying markers of sensitivity and combinatorial therapeutic strategies. 
 Cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) regulates cell cycle and is an emerging target for cancer therapy. There are relatively small numbers of tumor models that exhibit strong dependence on CDK2 and undergo G1 cell cycle arrest following CDK2 inhibition. The expression of P16INK4A and cyclin E1 determines this sensitivity to CDK2 inhibition. The co-expression of these genes occurs in breast cancer patients highlighting their clinical significance as predictive biomarkers for CDK2-targeted therapies. In cancer models that are genetically independent of CDK2, pharmacological inhibitors suppress cell proliferation by inducing 4N cell cycle arrest and increasing the expressions of phospho-CDK1 (Y15) and cyclin B1. CRISPR screens identify CDK2 loss as a mediator of resistance to a CDK2 inhibitor, INX-315. Furthermore, CDK2 deletion reverses the G2/M block induced by CDK2 inhibitors and restores cell proliferation. Complementary drug screens define multiple means to cooperate with CDK2 inhibition beyond G1/S. These include the depletion of mitotic regulators as well as CDK4/6 inhibitors cooperate with CDK2 inhibition in multiple phases of the cell cycle. Overall, this study underscores two fundamentally distinct features of response to CDK2 inhibitors that are conditioned by tumor context and could serve as the basis for differential therapeutic strategies in a wide range of cancers. It is becoming clear that heterogeneity in cancer cell cycles corresponds to variability of response to therapies targeting cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs).

Here, the authors show that the unusual chromosome size-dependent DNA replication timing in Leishmania is influenced by RNA-DNA hybrids that are recognised by the endonuclease RNase H1. 
 Genomes in eukaryotes normally undergo DNA replication in a choreographed temporal order, resulting in early and late replicating chromosome compartments. Leishmania, a human protozoan parasite, displays an unconventional DNA replication program in which the timing of DNA replication completion is chromosome size-dependent: larger chromosomes complete replication later then smaller ones. Here we show that both R-loops and RNase H1, a ribonuclease that resolves RNA-DNA hybrids, accumulate in Leishmania major chromosomes in a pattern that reflects their replication timing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such differential organisation of R-loops, RNase H1 and DNA replication timing across the parasite’s chromosomes correlates with size-dependent differences in chromatin accessibility, G quadruplex distribution and sequence content. Using conditional gene excision, we show that loss of RNase H1 leads to transient growth perturbation and permanently abrogates the differences in DNA replication timing across chromosomes, as well as altering levels of aneuploidy and increasing chromosome instability in a size-dependent manner. This work provides a link between R-loop homeostasis and DNA replication timing in a eukaryotic parasite and demonstrates that orchestration of DNA replication dictates levels of genome plasticity in Leishmania. All genomes are replicated in a temporal order, though the determinants of such timing are poorly characterized. Here, the authors show that the unusual chromosome size-dependent DNA replication timing in Leishmania is influenced by RNA-DNA hybrids that are recognised by the endonuclease RNase H1."

 Due to the great advancements in land surface models (LSMs), integrating data from thermal infrared (TIR) and LSMs is a promising way for obtaining gapless all-weather land surface temperature (LST). However, the differences of spatial resolution and discrepancy of data acquisition ways between TIR LST and model-simulated LST usually brought great challenges to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and texture details. This study proposes a low-resolution filling then super-resolution reconstruction (LFSR) framework for generating gapless all-weather LST using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST and China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) LST. For the LFSR, a multi-source multi-temporal low-resolution filling (MSMTLF) network is first designed to alleviate the discrepancy of data acquisition ways between the MODIS LST and CLDAS LST, and generate gapless low-resolution degraded LSTs. A multi-scale multi-temporal super-resolution reconstruction (MSMTSR) network is then used to reconstruct the gapless low-resolution degraded LSTs into gapless high-resolution MODIS-like LSTs with rich-texture, which is mainly used to deal with resolution differences between the two LSTs. The experiments suggested that the LFSR achieved satisfactory results, and the maximal RMSE is less 2.5 K in the simulated experiments. When validated against the in-situ LST data under clear and cloudy skies, the small difference of the overall average bias (−0.91 K for clear skies VS -0.88 K for cloudy skies) and overall average RMSE (4.15 K for clear skies VS 5.68 K for cloudy skies) were obtained. Compared with results from the different input data, the other strategies and the other methods, the generated gapless all-weather MODIS-like LSTs from the LFSR were closer to the actual labels or have better consistency and spatial details. These results indicated the LFSR achieves impressive performance for fusing MODIS and CLDAS data. The LFSR actually provides a new framework for fusing TIR LST and simulation-based LST with considerable data inconsistency, and has the potential for generating gapless all-weather TIR LST records."

 The Multiple Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) technology is capable of effectively generating ground deformation information derived from high-precision and continuous observation by satellites. However, due to the limited operational lifespan of a single SAR satellite, the derived ground deformation result of the study area cannot be ensured long-term (several decades), and merely a few years. With the increasing number of SAR satellite launches, it has become possible to conduct long-term continuous monitoring of ground deformation by combining data from multiple platforms. Nevertheless, several existing methods (e.g., model fitting method, predictive splicing method, etc.) have lower fusion accuracy and are limited to specific deformation patterns. In this study, a Piecewise Exponential Fitting with Weighted Average (PEFWA) method is proposed, which takes into account both the trend and accuracy of the preceding and following deformation time series in the fusion. The experimental results on the simulation data prove that the accuracy and robustness of this method are higher than several other methods. We applied the proposed method to characterize the evolution of ground deformation in the Beijing Plain from 1992 to 2023 using data from four different SAR satellites. The results show that: (1) With the implementation of various policies (e.g., the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, the Ecological Water Replenishment Project, etc.), ground subsidence has generally followed a trend of “worsening initially, then improving”. (2) The spatial variability of ground subsidence is primarily influenced by the locations of fault zones. (3) The periodic changes in the ground deformation time series are mainly driven by fluctuations in groundwater levels. The above findings indicate that the method proposed in this study can effectively integrate deformation series with temporal discontinuities, which helps detect the long-term trends and formation mechanisms of ground deformation."

 Change detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in remote sensing, crucial for monitoring urban expansion, land use changes, and environmental dynamics. However, compared with common color images, objects in remote sensing images exhibit minimal interclass variation and significant intraclass variation in the spectral dimension, with obvious scale inconsistency in the spatial dimension. Change detection complexity presents significant challenges, including differentiating similar objects, accounting for scale variations, and identifying pseudo changes. This research introduces a dual fine-grained network with a frequency Transformer (named as FTransDF-Net) to address the above issues. Specifically, for small-scale and approximate spectral ground objects, the network employs an encoder-decoder architecture consisting of dual fine-grained gated (DFG) modules. This enables the extraction and fusion of fine-grained level information in dual dimensions of features, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of their differences and correlations. As a result, a dynamic fusion representation of salient information is achieved. Additionally, we develop a lightweight frequency transformer (LFT) with minimal parameters for detecting large-scale ground objects that undergo significant changes over time. This is achieved by incorporating a frequency attention (FA) module, which utilizes Fourier transform to model long-range dependencies and combines global adaptive attentive features with multi-level fine-grained features. Our comparative experiments across four publicly available datasets demonstrate that FTransDF-Net reaches advanced results. Importantly, it outperforms the leading comparison method by 1.23% and 2.46% regarding IoU metrics concerning CDD and DSIFN, respectively.

 Submicron particles (PM1) play a critical role in air quality, climate, and human health. Long-term monitoring is essential to identify changes in atmospheric composition driven by natural or anthropogenic emissions and processes. This study presents ten years of continuous measurements (Sept. 2012–Aug. 2022) at the TROPOS Melpitz research station in Germany, a Central European rural background site influenced by its location between Eastern and Western Europe. Using an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and a multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP), alongside a rolling positive matrix factorization (PMF) model for organic aerosol (OA) source apportionment, we analyzed PM1 trends, chemical composition, and source contributions over a decade. The results reveal a significant negative PM1 trend of −4.59% y−1, with pronounced decreases occurring in fall and winter. Eastern air masses showed marked improvements (−28% y−1), likely reflecting regional mitigation policies. OA, contributing 44% of total PM1, showed a negative trend of −2.05% y−1 and comprised three primary OA (POA) sources—hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), and coal combustion OA (CCOA)—and two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors (less-oxidized and more-oxidized OA, LO-OOA and MO-OOA). HOA (7% of total OA) remained relatively stable, with a minor decline (−0.25% y−1) under Eastern air masses. In contrast, BBOA (10% of OA) and CCOA (12% of OA) displayed strong seasonality, driven by residential heating and energy production. Notably, BBOA increased by +0.48 % y−1 during summer, likely due to the rise in wood pellet heating, recreative, and/or wildfires, while CCOA showed a modest increase (+0.27% y−1) in Western air masses. The OOA factors, LO-OOA and MO-OOA (31% and 40% of OA, respectively), reflected distinct seasonal patterns tied to atmospheric formation pathways. Both showed declining trends in Eastern air masses (−1.52% y−1 and −1.09% y−1), indicating changes in biogenic emissions and/or anthropogenic precursors. Finally, eBC(PM1) decreased by −1.3 % y−1 with strong source dependency. Compared to urban areas, the overall decrease of PM mass concentration and anthropogenic OA looks limited, emphasizing a potentially lower effect of political mitigation outside cities. Overall, the findings underscore the importance of monitoring long-term changes in PM1 composition and sources, which are crucial for understanding aerosol physical properties, refining climate models and public health, and evaluating the impacts of mitigation efforts on air quality and climate in different environments. Further studies on a similar approach are strongly needed to better understand the geographical variation of the aerosol chemical composition and evaluate their potential effect."
