10.1088/1748-9326/ae0954,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注城市绿地面积（通过NDVI衡量）的变化对全球城市居民全因死亡率的影响。虽然使用了卫星观测数据来计算NDVI，但其核心在于评估城市绿地与人口健康之间的关系，而非直接研究大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。文章侧重于流行病学和公共卫生领域，利用NDVI作为城市环境健康的一个指标，评估其变化对人群死亡率的影响。,"['NDVI', 'Urban Greenspace', 'Mortality', 'Health Impact Assessment', 'Satellite Observations (indirectly, through NDVI)', 'Population Health']",Greta K Martin;Jennifer D Stowell;Patrick L Kinney;Susan C Anenberg,A health impact assessment of changes in NDVI on all-cause mortality across 1041 global cities,"Urban greenspaces are associated with improved health and climate resiliency. Large scale health impact assessments of urban greenspace and mortality have been limited to American and European cities. We estimated changes in mortality associated with observed differences in population-weighted greenest season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) between 2014–2018 and 2019–2023 across 1041 global cities representing 174 countries. We used publicly available high-resolution satellite-derived estimates of NDVI and population, baseline disease rates from the Global Burden of Disease study, and a hazard ratio of the association between NDVI and all-cause mortality from an epidemiological meta-analysis. We found that urban greenspace varies substantially across cities (NDVI mean: 0.270, range: 0.072, 0.580) and by climate classification and geographic region. Despite modest global average changes in NDVI from 2014–2018 to 2019–2023, NDVI has changed by over ±20% in individual cities. Median regional changes were largest in South-eastern Asia (−0.022), Sub-Saharan Africa (−0.010) and Eastern Asia (+0.014) and most stable in arid climates (<0.000). These changes were associated with a global mean of 0.19 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.27) additional annual deaths per 100 000 in the 2020 population, ranging from 24.44 fewer to 21.84 more deaths per 100 000 across cities. Health impact assessments of NDVI and all-cause mortality have largely been conducted in European and North American cities, where we found NDVI was generally higher and more stable. Our results highlight large heterogeneity in urban greenspace extent and variability across global cities and the importance of characterizing the relationship between health and NDVI in more diverse contexts."

Hostetler;Simone Tanelli,"Observed impacts of aerosol concentration on maritime tropical convection within constrained environments using airborne radiometer, radar, lidar, and dropsondes","Decoupling aerosol and environmental impacts on convection is challenging. Using airborne data, we correlated convective metrics with aerosol concentrations in several different environments. Results were mixed, but some comparisons suggest that medium-to-high aerosol concentrations were occasionally strongly correlated with convective intensity and prevalence, especially when the atmosphere was relatively unstable. It is important to consider storm environment when evaluating aerosol effects. 
 Aerosol modulation of atmospheric convection remains an important topic in ongoing research. A key challenge in evaluating aerosol impacts on cumulus convection is isolating their effects from environmental influences.  This work investigates aerosol effects on maritime tropical convection using airborne observations from NASA's Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex). Eight environmental parameters with known physical connections to cloud and storm formation were identified from dropsonde data, and 92 dropsondes were matched with corresponding CAMP2Ex flight “scenes.” To constrain environmental conditions, scenes were binned based on their association with “low,” “medium,” or “high” values for each dropsonde-derived parameter. In each scene and environmental bin, eight radar- and radiometer-based parameters with physical implications for convective intensity and/or prevalence were correlated with lidar-derived aerosol concentrations to examine trends in convective characteristics under different aerosol conditions. Threshold values used to stratify the environments were varied across four sensitivity tests to examine how the convective–aerosol correlations within each environmental bin responded. The results were generally inconclusive, with relatively weak correlations observed with limited statistical significance in many cases. Some interesting and potentially impactful comparisons identified in the convective–aerosol analyses support the idea of warm-phase convective invigoration trends and suggest that higher aerosol concentrations were correlated with stronger and/or more-prevalent convection in some cases, while other cases saw a “Goldilocks” zone of medium aerosol concentration favoring enhanced convection. Our results also stress the importance of considering environmental conditions when evaluating aerosol impacts."

We show that their interactions modify, in a definitive way, the concentrations of the gas phase and the surface properties of the dust, which could have important implications for the atmospheric composition and the Earth's climate. 
 The uptake of glyoxal on realistic submicron mineral dust aerosol particles from a natural soil (Gobi Desert) is investigated during experiments in a large simulation chamber, under variable experimental conditions of relative humidity (RH), irradiation, and ozone concentrations. The uptake of glyoxal on the dust particles starts as soon as the glyoxal is injected into the chamber. At 80 % RH, the measured uptake coefficient of glyoxal on mineral dust is γ = (9±5) × 10−3. The totality of the mass of reacting glyoxal is transformed into organic matter on the surface of the dust particles. The uptake of glyoxal is accompanied by the appearance of marker peaks in the organic mass spectra and a persistent growth in the volume concentration of the dust particles. While the mass of the organic matter on the dust rapidly reverts to values prior to uptake, the organic composition of the dust is modified irreversibly. Glycolic and other organic acids, but also oligomers, are detected on the dust. At 80 % RH, compounds ranging from C4 to C10 are observed as oligomerization products of glyoxal mono- and di-hydrate forms. The study suggests that dust aerosols could play a very substantial role in the formation of organic aerosols at high RH, but also that the reaction could have potentially important implications for the dust optical and hygroscopic properties, including their pH."

Diallo;Cosme Alexandre Oliveira Barros Figueiredo;Diego Barros;Ligia Alves da Silva;Patrick Essien;Anderson Vestena Bilibio,Modulation of tropical stratospheric gravity wave activity and the ITCZ position by modes of climate variability using radio occultation and reanalysis data,"We studied how the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) interacts with atmospheric gravity waves high in the sky and how global climate patterns like El Niño affect them. Using RO, ERA5, and NCEP reanalysis data, we found that the ITCZ shifts with season but stays strong year-round, influencing weather and energy flow. Our findings show how climate patterns shape weather systems and help predict changes, improving understanding of the atmosphere and its effects on global climate. 
 The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a dominant feature of tropical climate characterized by intense convection that influences global atmospheric circulation and serves as a primary source of stratospheric gravity waves (GWs), which transport energy and momentum vertically through the atmosphere. This study investigates the modulation of the tropical ITCZ position and stratospheric gravity wave activity by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) using 11 years (2011–2021) of radio occultation and reanalysis data. ITCZ latitude (from 850 hPa refractivity) and gravity wave potential energy maxima (from stratospheric temperatures) were identified via Gaussian fitting. Both ITCZ and gravity wave potential energy maxima exhibit coherent seasonal migration (∼10 and ∼5° latitudinal shifts, respectively), with potential energy maxima typically equatorward of the ITCZ. ENSO is the primary modulator: El Niño conditions shift the ITCZ northward in the American sector but southward in the African and Asian sectors. For gravity wave potential energy maxima, El Niño induces southward shifts in the American sector but northward shifts in the Asian sector, while enhancing overall GW activity. The MJO prompts regionally complex southward shifts in the ITCZ/potential energy maxima. The QBO predominantly influences gravity wave potential energy, with westerly phases associated with southward shifts in the potential energy maxima in the African and Asian sectors. While long-term latitudinal trends are weak, climate modes significantly impact ITCZ/GW peak values. The radio occultation data captured finer-scale features than reanalysis products, highlighting the importance of observational constraints in understanding troposphere–stratosphere coupling mechanisms."

Sommar;Xinyu Shi;Xueling Tang;Guangyi Sun;Che-Jen Lin;Xinbin Feng,"Atmospheric mercury: recent advances in theoretical, computational, experimental, observational, and isotopic understanding to decipher its redox transformations in the upper and lower atmosphere and interactions with Earth surface reservoirs","A more thorough understanding of the complex processes involved in the atmospheric Hg cycle has been achieved. The dynamics of the cycle are influenced by a rapid redox chemistry with several oxidation states and effects of multiphase interactions. This review provides a detailed analysis of the atmospheric chemistry of Hg in both the lower and the upper atmosphere, together with a synthesis of the latest kinetic, thermochemical, photochemical, and isotopic fractionation data. 
 Mercury is a volatile heavy element with no known biological function. It is present in trace amounts (on average, ∼ 80 ppb) but is not geochemically well blended in the Earth's crust. As a result, it occurs in extremely high concentrations (up to a few percent) in certain locations. It is found along tectonic plate faults in deposits of sulfide ores (cinnabar), and it has been extensively mobilized during the Anthropocene. Mercury is currently one of the most targeted global pollutants, with methylmercury compounds being particularly neurotoxic. Over 5000 t of mercury is released into the atmosphere annually through primary emissions and secondary re-emissions. Much of the re-emitted mercury resulting from exchanges with surface reservoirs is related to (legacy) human activities, such as direct releases. Understanding the dynamics of the global Hg cycle is critical for assessing the impact of emission reductions under the UN Minamata Convention, which became legally binding in 2017. This review of atmospheric mercury focuses on fundamental advances in field, laboratory, and theoretical studies, including six stable Hg isotope analytical methods, which have contributed recently to a more mature understanding of the complexity of the atmospheric Hg cycle and its interactions with the Earth's surface ecosystem."

The average global NH3 emissions over the period are ~97 Tg NH3 yr-1, which is significantly higher than three reference inventories. The analysis provides confidence in the seasonal variability and regional budgets and provides new insights into NH3 emissions at global and regional scales. 
 Ammonia (NH3) emissions have been on a continuous rise due to extensive fertilizer usage in agriculture and increasing production of manure and livestock. However, the current global-to-national NH3 emission inventories exhibit large uncertainties. We provide atmospheric inversion estimates of the global NH3 emissions over 2019–2022 at 1.27° × 2.5° horizontal and daily (at 10 d scale) resolution. We use IASI-ANNI-NH3-v4 satellite observations, simulations of NH3 concentrations with the chemistry transport model LMDZ-INCA, and the finite difference mass-balance approach for inversions of global NH3 emissions. We take advantage of the averaging kernels provided in the IASI-ANNI-NH3-v4 dataset by applying them consistently to the LMDZ-INCA NH3 simulations for comparison to the observations and then to invert emissions. The average global anthropogenic NH3 emissions over 2019–2022 are estimated as ∼97 (94–100) Tg yr−1, which is ∼61 % (∼55 %–65 %) higher than the prior Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory's anthropogenic NH3 emissions and significantly higher than two other global inventories: CAMS's anthropogenic NH3 emissions (by a factor of ∼1.8) and the Calculation of AMmonia Emissions in ORCHIDEE (CAMEO) agricultural and natural soil NH3 emissions (by ∼1.4 times). The global and regional budgets are mostly within the range of other inversion estimates. The analysis provides confidence in their seasonal variability and continental- to regional-scale budgets. Our analysis shows a rise in NH3 emissions by ∼5 % to ∼37 % during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 over different regions compared to the same-period emissions in 2019. However, this rise is probably due to a decrease in atmospheric NH3 sinks due to the decline in NOx and SO2 emissions during the lockdowns."

Our findings highlight that organic matter, sulfate, and nitrate are the dominant contributors to PM2.5 mass concentrations. Notable seasonal variations in the light absorption capacity of water-soluble brown carbon, accompanied by a high degree of oxidation are also observed. 
 Brown carbon (BrC) aerosols have attracted considerable attention due to their significant climatic effects, yet their sources, optical properties, and seasonal behavior remain poorly understood in remote high-altitude regions. In this study, year-long fine particular-matter (PM2.5) samples were collected at a receptor site in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) to investigate the optical and chemical properties and sources of water-soluble BrC (WS-BrC). The annual average PM2.5 concentration was 10.3 ± 7.4 µg m−3 with clear seasonal variation (spring > winter > fall > summer). Organic aerosol (OA) was the major component across all seasons with an annual contribution of 37.7 % to the total PM2.5 mass, followed by sulfate (21.3 %), nitrate (12.1 %), and other species. Backward trajectory analysis indicated that aerosols were mainly transported from the northeast and east of the sampling site. The seasonal mass absorption efficiency of WS-BrC at the wavelength of 365nm (MAE365) were 0.92 ± 0.54 m2g−1 in spring, 0.40 ± 0.24 m2 g−1 in summer, 0.81 ± 0.46 m2 g−1 in fall, and 0.97 ± 0.49 m2 g−1 in winter, exhibiting a relatively weak light absorption throughout the year with the strongest photobleaching in summer. Notably, WS-BrC light absorption was positively correlated with the oxidation degree of OA during spring and winter, but negatively correlated in summer and fall, suggesting different chemical aging processes and sources of BrC. These findings enhance our understanding of BrC behavior on the TP and contribute to assessments of its climatic impacts in this high-altitude region."

The method is tested in two different case studies by comparison to dedicated scanning radars revealing promising results. Future usage of the method is motivated by analyzing the coverage of the operational radar network finding advantageous locations with good radar coverage. 
 A beam-aware columnar vertical profile (BA-CVP) methodology that incorporates data of the national German operational radar network with the aim of augmenting vertically pointing cloud radars is introduced. The method uses polarimetric radar data collected in plan position indicator (PPI) scans of multiple operational radars and considers the contributions of each operational radar in a beam-aware manner. The results of the method are paired with measurements of a vertically pointing cloud radar located in range of the operational radars and compared to measurements of dedicated scanning radars collected in range–height indicator (RHI) scans for two different case studies. The combination of side-looking operational radars in the BA-CVP format with a vertically pointing cloud radar allows the simultaneous exploitation of polarimetric multi-frequency observations including radar variables like the differential reflectivity, the dual-wavelength ratio, Doppler fall-speed and linear depolarization ratio measurements to study the microphysical properties of hydrometeors while not having to rely on the availability of dedicated scanning radars. The extracted BA-CVPs based on operational data deliver good results with respect to resolving finer details in radar reflectivity and differential reflectivity when compared to measurements of dedicated radars. Usage of differential phase measurements is discussed as marker for high hydrometeor attenuation affecting the measurements of radars far from the point of interest. For future use of this method, the coverage of the national German operational radar network is studied and recommendations for locations with potential for additional vertically pointing cloud radars are pointed out."

Highly precise artificial radar targets are generated with a radar target simulator and serve as a calibration reference for weather radar observables like reflectivity and Doppler velocity. The system allows investigating and correcting any biases associated with weather radar observations. 
 We present findings from radar calibration experiments involving three radars operated by the Colorado State University (CSU) in the US and by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. The experiments were based on the comparison between measured radar variables and the known properties of artificial point targets electronically generated with a polarimetric radar target simulator (RTS) from Palindrome Remote Sensing. Radars under test included the two magnetron-based radars CHILL and SPLASH (its mobile version) from CSU and EPFL's new solid-state radar StXPol.For the CHILL and SPLASH calibration measurements in Colorado, a mobile lifting platform was employed that elevated the target simulator instrument to approximately 15 m above ground. The creation of virtual targets with polarimetric signatures allowed for a direct calibration of polarimetric variables. While the SPLASH radar exhibited good Zdr and sufficient Zh accuracy, remarkable precision and stability were found in CHILL's reflectivity data time series, where the reflectivity bias compared to the virtual target was less than 0.2 dB over a 1 h time series.Calibration issues that arise with solid-state radar systems were investigated with experiments conducted with the EPFL StXPol radar. This pulse compression system transmits a linear frequency-modulated long pulse as well as a non-modulated short pulse for observations at close ranges. The two pulses are separated in frequency by 50 MHz, and consequently calibration targets were generated independently for the two channels. Excellent stability and accuracy were found for Zdr in both channels. While Zh stability was also very high, a large reflectivity bias in both the long and the short pulse channel was detected.For the first time, the article introduces and analyzes a weather radar calibration procedure that is based on electronically generated radar targets. Experimental data suggest that precise absolute and differential calibrations can be achieved if data are obtained in an environment free from multipaths and if the generated targets are precisely located in the center of the radar's range gate. Experimental shortcomings associated with limited sampling resolution of the radar scan over the targets are also investigated."

Simonson,A large-eddy simulation exploration of the assumptions used in retrieving entrainment from a mixing diagram approach with ground-based remote sensors,"Entrainment is key in understanding temperature and moisture changes within the boundary layer, but it is difficult to observe using ground-based observations. This work used simulations to verify an assumption that simplifies entrainment estimations from ground-based observational data, recognizing that entrainment is the combination of the transfer of heat and moisture from above the boundary layer into it and the change in concentration of heat and moisture as boundary layer depth changes. 
 Entrainment is a crucial component of the atmospheric boundary layer (BL) moisture and heat budget. While usually thought of as only entrainment flux, entrainment within the mixed layer budget equation is really composed of two terms: the flux of a property across the boundary separating the BL from the free troposphere and the change in the concentration of a property as the depth of the BL changes. In a recent study, Wakefield et al. (2023) used ground-based remote-sensing observations to estimate entrainment flux as the residual of a mixing diagram framework that was applied to the daytime convective boundary layer. This present work uses large-eddy simulation (LES) to examine how well this residual assumption for entrainment fluxes alone compares to the actual sum of those two entrainment terms derived from spatial averages of the LES output. We highlight the importance of the second entrainment term in closing the mixed layer budget and show that the residual assumption does not represent entrainment flux only but rather a total entrainment term when the boundary layer depth is changing."

 Few scholars have compiled databases of soil microbial communities and associated climate, soil and vegetation factors at the global scale. However, many studies involving high-throughput sequencing of soil bacteria and fungi have been published in the past decade. In this study, we constructed a global database of the soil microbial communities and the associated climate, soil and vegetation factors, with sites on each of the seven continents and eleven ecosystem types. There were 8490 sets of soil bacterial and fungal community data for the different treatments and study sites in the database. Soil bacterial and fungal diversities were highly variable across various ecosystems. There was a highly significant (R2 = 0.4037, P < 0.001) linear regression relationship between the fungal and bacterial Shannon indices. Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were the most species-rich bacterial and fungal phyla, respectively, in most ecosystems. The median relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were 29.30 % and 57.49 %, respectively. The information (e.g., site names and ecosystem types) in the database enabled researchers to investigate where the most abundant bacterial or fungal phylum was located and whether the ecosystem type affected bacterial and fungal diversities and compositions at the global scale. We anticipated that this database could be further improved by adding more detailed information, such as bacterial and fungal compositions at the class, order, family, and genus levels.

 Several current models for the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity curve consider the conductivity of the domains of capillary water in water-filled pores and adsorbed water in films on soil grains, as well as an equivalent conductivity for water vapour diffusion. These models rely on unrealistic configuration of the domains. A junction model is introduced that sidesteps this problem by assigning all liquid water to films (dry range) or to capillaries (wet range). Combined with a sigmoidal junction model for the soil water retention curve, it has up to six fitting parameters, one fewer than the other multi-domain models. Tests on data for 13 soils show that the junction model and an additive model (that adds all domain conductivities) often produce good fits. Models with six or more parameters may be overparameterized for many soils, giving the more parsimonious junction model an advantage, but for some soils, the extra parameter of the additive model is needed to achieve a good fit. This paper and a user manual document a Fortran code (KRIAfitter) that uses the shuffled complex evolution algorithm to fit the junction, additive, and four other conductivity models for any combination of fixed and fitting parameters or their log transforms. KRIAfitter either maps the root mean square error in the entire parameter space in order to then constrain the parameter space around the likely global minimum or generates many fits and uses those to calculate statistics for individual parameters, as well as the covariance and correlation matrices."

Here, we analyze the global alignment of principal horizontal tectonic stresses, fault traces, and river flow directions to infer whether and how deep subsurface stresses control geomorphic features. We find that fault trace orientations are consistent with predictions from Anderson's fault theory. River directions largely align with fault traces and partly with stresses. The degree of alignment depends on fault regime, the source of stress, and river order. Extensional faulting is best predicted by stresses from lithospheric structure variations, while compressive faulting is best predicted by stresses from mantle flow.

Beyond climate sensitivity differences, regional climate feedbacks—like Arctic sea‐ice loss—drive model uncertainty of the climate response. By applying emergent constraints based on the observed global warming trend and a metric related to Arctic sea ice loss, we reduce uncertainty in projected air temperature and precipitation changes over high‐latitude land areas. Based on an imperfect model test, such projections outperform projections constrained using only the global warming trend or unconstrained projections. Compared to unconstrained projections, our approach reduces uncertainty by 22%–47% for temperature changes and 10%–51% for precipitation changes across different IPCC regions in the mid to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere by the end of the century under a middle‐of‐the‐road scenario."

This energy—in principle—could be a source for submarine melting, which scales with near‐terminus water temperature and velocity. Because near‐terminus currents are challenging to observe or predict, submarine melt remains a key uncertainty in projecting tidewater glacier retreat and sea level rise. Here, we study one submarine calving event at Xeitl Sít’ (LeConte Glacier), Alaska, to explore the effect of calving on ice melt, using a suite of autonomously deployed instruments beneath, around, and downstream of the calving iceberg. Our measurements captured flows exceeding 5 m/s and demonstrate how potential energy converts to kinetic energy EK $\left({E}_{K}\right)$. While most energy decays quickly (through turbulence, mixing, and radiated waves), near‐terminus EK ${E}_{K}$ remains elevated, nearly doubling predicted melt rates for hours after the event.

Current cutoff precedes several lightning phenomena, notably dart leaders and return strokes, but the process by which a hot, highly‐conducting leader channel can undergo current cutoff is poorly understood. In this work, we present self‐consistent simulations of positive leader propagation, which include coupled treatment of electrodynamics and plasma physics. The unstable positive leader spontaneously undergoes channel cutoff and creates the conditions for the emission of dart leaders, that is, it accumulates a packet of negative charge at the intersection between cutoff and conducting channel segments. A residual conductivity in the cutoff section facilitates the conversion of the electric field enhancement into a traveling wave, which retraces and reionizes the channel. This is critical for allowing the frail positive leader to keep propagating."

Populations of neurons that rapidly respond to noxious stimuli or tissue damage have been identified in the spinal cord and several nuclei in the brain2–4. Understanding the central mechanisms that signal ongoing sustained pain, including after tissue healing, remains a challenge5.

Hunger, thirst or predator cues suppressed sustained pain, regardless of the injury type, by inhibiting parabrachial Y1R neurons via the release of NPY.

 In renewing tissues, mutations conferring selective advantage may result in clonal expansions1–4. In contrast to somatic tissues, mutations driving clonal expansions in spermatogonia (CES) are also transmitted to the next generation. This results in an effective increase of de novo mutation rate for CES drivers5–8. CES was originally discovered through extreme recurrence of de novo mutations causing Apert syndrome5. Here, we develop a systematic approach to discover CES drivers as hotspots of human de novo mutation. Our analysis of 54,715 trios ascertained for rare conditions9–13, 6,065 control trios12,14–19 and population variation from 807,162 mostly healthy individuals20 identifies genes manifesting rates of de novo mutations inconsistent with plausible models of disease ascertainment. We propose 23 genes hypermutable at loss-of-function (LoF) sites as candidate CES drivers. An extra 17 genes feature hypermutable missense mutations at individual positions, suggesting CES acting through gain of function. CES increases the average mutation rate roughly 17-fold for LoF genes in both control trios and sperm and roughly 500-fold for pooled gain-of-function sites in sperm21. Positive selection in the male germline elevates the prevalence of genetic disorders and increases polymorphism levels, masking the effect of negative selection in human populations. Despite the excess of mutations in disease cohorts for 19 LoF CES driver candidates, only 9 show clear evidence of disease causality22, suggesting that CES may lead to false-positive disease associations.

 Are widespread stereotypes accurate1–3 or socially distorted4–6? This continuing debate is limited by the lack of large-scale multimodal data on stereotypical associations and the inability to compare these to ground truth indicators. Here we overcame these challenges in the analysis of age-related gender bias7–9, for which age provides an objective anchor for evaluating stereotype accuracy. Despite there being no systematic age differences between women and men in the workforce according to the US Census, we found that women are represented as younger than men across occupations and social roles in nearly 1.4 million images and videos from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr and YouTube, as well as in nine language models trained on billions of words from the internet. This age gap is the starkest for content depicting occupations with higher status and earnings. We demonstrate how mainstream algorithms amplify this bias. A nationally representative pre-registered experiment (n = 459) found that Googling images of occupations amplifies age-related gender bias in participants’ beliefs and hiring preferences. Furthermore, when generating and evaluating resumes, ChatGPT assumes that women are younger and less experienced, rating older male applicants as of higher quality. Our study shows how gender and age are jointly distorted throughout the internet and its mediating algorithms, thereby revealing critical challenges and opportunities in the fight against inequality.

The ATOM2CHIP blueprint includes a full-stack on-chip process and a cross-platform system design, providing a complete framework to bridge the gap from emerging device concept to an applicable chip. The full-stack on-chip process is a specially designed flow that incorporates planar integration, three-dimensional (3D) architecture and chip packaging, contributing to a high yield of 94.34% based on a full-chip test. The cross-platform system design handles both the 2D circuit design and the 2D-CMOS modules compatibility verification design, contributing to a highly complex, instruction-driven, full-featured chip with 8-bit commands and 32-bit parallelism. These results demonstrate an efficient system integration strategy that showcases the advantages of the 2D electronic system.

 As we age, many tissues become colonized by microscopic clones carrying somatic driver mutations1–7. Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of this phenomenon remains limited due to the challenge of detecting mutations in small clones. Here we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq)8, a duplex sequencing method with an error rate lower than five errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted capture. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity simultaneously profiles large numbers of clones, providing accurate mutation rates, signatures and driver frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 blood samples from a twin cohort, we report an extremely rich selection landscape, with 46 genes under positive selection in oral epithelium, more than 62,000 driver mutations and evidence of negative selection in essential genes. High-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites are obtained for many genes: a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition or selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing provides a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.

 The amount of biological sequencing data available in public repositories is growing rapidly, forming a critical resource for biomedicine.

We present MetaGraph, a methodological framework that enables us to scalably index large sets of DNA, RNA or protein sequences using annotated de Bruijn graphs. Integrating data from seven public sources7–13, we make 18.8 million unique DNA and RNA sequence sets and 210 billion amino acid residues across all clades of life—including viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants, animals and humans—full-text searchable. We demonstrate the feasibility of a cost-effective full-text search in large sequence repositories (67 petabase pairs (Pbp) of raw sequence) at an on-demand cost of around US$100 for small queries up to 1 megabase pairs (Mbp) and down to US$0.74 per queried Mbp for large queries. We show that the highly compressed representation of all public biological sequences could fit on a few consumer hard drives (total cost of around US$2,500), making it cost-effective to use and readily transportable for further analysis. We explore several practical use cases to mine existing archives for interesting associations, demonstrating the use of our indexes for integrative analyses, and illustrating that such capabilities are poised to catalyse advancements in biomedical research.

 Mutations that occur in the cell lineages of sperm or eggs can be transmitted to offspring. In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis can increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders1–3. Until recently, characterizing the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Here we used the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq4 to sequence 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24–75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% confidence interval of 1.41–1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq5 of sperm samples identified more than 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 newly identified) under significant positive selection in the male germline that have activating or loss-of-function mechanisms and are involved in diverse cellular pathways. Most of the positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, whereas four of the genes exhibited increased frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We show that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2–3-fold increased risk of known disease-causing mutations, which results in 3–5% of sperm from middle-aged to older individuals with a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on germline selection dynamics and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.

 Even with the rapid development of renewable energy sources, improving the efficiency of energy conversion from fossil or synthetic fuels remains a challenge because, for example, combustion engines in long-range aircraft will still be needed in the upcoming decades1. Increasing their operating temperatures (1,050–1,150 °C (refs. 2–4)) is one option. This requires replacing single-crystalline Ni-based superalloys in the hottest sections of turbines by refractory-element-based materials, which exhibit much higher solidus temperatures beyond 2,000 °C (refs. 5–7). Here we introduce a single-phase Cr-36.1Mo-3Si (at.%) alloy that meets, for the first time, to our knowledge, the most important critical requirements for refractory-element-based materials: (1) relevant resistance against pesting, nitridation and scale spallation at elevated temperatures, minimum up to 1,100 °C, and (2) sufficient compression ductility at room temperature. Although strength and creep resistance in such alloys were already superior to Ni-based superalloys in several cases, oxidation/corrosion resistance, mandatory to withstand the combustion atmosphere, and ductility/toughness, needed for damage tolerance and device setting, still pose barriers for the development or application of refractory-element-based candidate materials. Any previous successful attempts to address the otherwise catastrophic oxidation of Mo and nitridation of Cr during oxidation suffered from a loss in ductility at ambient temperatures. A single-phase chromium–molybdenum–silicon alloy is described that exhibits compression ductility at room temperature as well as resistance to oxidation, pesting, nitridation and scale spallation at temperatures up to at least 1,100 °C."

 The ancient South Pole–Aitken impact basin provides a key data point for our understanding of the evolution of the Moon, as it formed during the earliest pre-Nectarian epoch of lunar history1, excavated more deeply than any other known impact basin2,3 and is found on the lunar far side, about which less is known than the well-explored near side. Here we show that the tapering of the basin outline and the more gradual topographic and crustal thickness transition towards the south support a southward impact trajectory, opposite of that commonly assumed. A broad thorium-rich and iron-rich ejecta deposit southwest of the basin is consistent with partial excavation of late-stage magma ocean liquids. These observations indicate that thorium-rich magma ocean liquids persisted only beneath the southwestern half of the basin at the time of impact, matching predictions for the transition from a global magma ocean to a local enrichment of potassium, rare-earth elements and phosphorus (KREEP) in the near-side Procellarum KREEP Terrane. These results have important implications for the upcoming human exploration of the lunar south pole by Artemis, as proposed landing sites are now recognized to sit on the downrange rim and thorium-rich impact ejecta of the basin.

 Men are at higher risk of several cancer types than women1. For bladder cancer the risk is four times higher for reasons that are not clear2. Smoking is also a principal risk factor for several tumour types, including bladder cancer3. As tumourigenesis is driven by somatic mutations, we wondered whether the landscape of clones in the normal bladder differs by sex and smoking history. Using ultradeep duplex DNA sequencing (approximately 5,000×), we identified thousands of clonal driver mutations in 16 genes across 79 normal bladder samples from 45 people. Men had significantly more truncating driver mutations in RBM10, CDKN1A and ARID1A than women, despite similar levels of non-protein-affecting mutations. This result indicates stronger positive selection on driver truncating mutations in these genes in the male urothelium. We also found activating TERT promoter mutations driving clonal expansions in the normal bladder that were associated strongly with age and smoking. These findings indicate that bladder cancer risk factors, such as sex and smoking, shape the clonal landscape of the normal urothelium. The high number of mutations identified by this approach offers a new strategy to study the functional effect of thousands of mutations in vivo—natural saturation mutagenesis—that can be extended to other human tissues. Sex bias and association with smoking history identified in the landscape of driver mutations and clonal expansions in normal human bladder tissue may explain the higher bladder cancer risk in men and smokers."

 Optical lattice clocks are at the forefront of precision metrology1–6, operating near a standard quantum limit set by quantum noise4,7. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit8–15; however, there are practical difficulties in terms of scalability and measurement resolution requirements16,17. Here we adapt the holonomic quantum gate concept18 to develop a new Rabi-type ‘global-phase spectroscopy’ that uses the detuning-sensitive global Aharonov–Anandan phase19. With this approach, we can demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy on an optical clock transition that achieves directly measured 2.4(7) dB metrological gain and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. To this end, we introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light–atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-cancelling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily because of the global nature of entangling interaction and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits20–22.

 During DNA replication, the replisome must remove barriers and roadblocks including the transcription machinery1,2. Transcription–replication conflicts (TRCs) occur when there are collisions between the replisome and transcription machinery, and are increasingly recognized as an important source of mammalian genome instability3. How cells facilitate replisome bypass at sites of TRCs is incompletely understood. Here we show that the CUL3–KCTD10 E3 ligase senses TRCs and promotes remodelling of the RNA polymerase complex to allow replisome bypass. We found that the substrate adaptor KCTD10 interacts with the replisome and the transcription machinery and regulates both in unstressed conditions. These bivalent interactions allow KCTD10 to detect co-directional TRCs and facilitate higher-order assembly of KCTD10 complexes that recruit CUL3 to induce the ubiquitination and removal of the RNA polymerase factor TCEA2. In the absence of KCTD10, there is increased retention of TCEA2 and the RNA polymerase complex, causing an accumulation of TRCs and increased DNA damage. Our results demonstrate how replication can proceed through transcriptionally active regions, utilizing a unique bridging function of the CUL3–KCTD10 complex. These findings provide a framework for how the coordination between transcription and replication may contribute to the maintenance of genome stability.

 Nonlinear optics1 plays a central role in many photonic technologies, both classical2–5 and quantum6–8. However, the function of a nonlinear-optical device is typically determined during design and fixed during fabrication9, restricting the use of nonlinear optics to scenarios in which this inflexibility is tolerable. Here we present a photonic device with highly programmable nonlinear functionality: an optical slab waveguide with an arbitrarily reconfigurable two-dimensional distribution of χ(2) nonlinearity. The nonlinearity is realized using electric-field-induced χ(2) (refs. 10–16), and the programmability is engineered by massively parallel control of the electric-field distribution within the device using a photoconductive layer and optical programming with a spatial light pattern. To showcase the versatility of our device, we demonstrate spectral, spatial and spatio-spectral engineering of second-harmonic generation by tailoring arbitrary quasi-phase-matching grating structures1 in two dimensions. The programmability of the device makes it possible to perform inverse design of grating structures in situ, as well as real-time feedback to compensate for fluctuations in operating and environmental conditions. Our work shows that we can break from the conventional one-device–one-function paradigm, potentially expanding the applications of nonlinear optics to situations in which fast device reconfigurability is desirable—such as in programmable optical quantum gates and quantum light sources7,17–19, all-optical signal processing20, optical computation21 and adaptive structured light for sensing22–24.

 Cognitive processes underlying behaviour are linked to specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the neocortex1–6. These patterns arise from synchronous synaptic activity7 and are often analysed as oscillations, but may also display aperiodic dynamics that are not well detected. Here we develop a novel analytical method decomposing patterned activity into discrete network events and use this approach to track gamma activity (30–80 Hz) in the mouse visual cortex (V1). We find that the gamma event rate varies with arousal and individual events can cluster in brief oscillatory bouts but also occur in isolation. Individual events synchronize neural firing across layers and promote enhanced visual encoding. V1 gamma events are evoked by patterned input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and suppressed by optogenetic modulation of the dLGN, suggesting that they support thalamocortical integration of visual information. In behaving mice, the gamma event rate increases steadily before visually cued behavioural responses, predicting trial-by-trial performance. Suppressing V1 gamma events impairs visual detection performance, whereas evoking them elicits a behavioural response. This relationship between gamma events and behaviour is sensory modality specific and rapidly modulated by changes in task objectives. Gamma events thus support a flexible encoding of visual information according to behavioural context. Using a new analytical method for tracking gamma band events in mouse visual cortex, flexible encoding of visual information according to behavioural context is shown."

Here, the authors report the development of a boron-free material based on a shear-stiffening polytitanosiloxane network through a metal-ion-mediated hydrogen bond enhancement strategy. 
 Shear stiffening gel (SSG) with prominent rate-dependent mechanical properties is promising for impact protection, but conventional boron-based SSG suffers from toxicity and corrosion arising from boric acid. Here, we design a boron-free supramolecular dynamic reversible network of polytitanosiloxane (PTS) based on the metal-ion-mediated hydrogen bonding enhancement strategy. Different oxidation states of Ti atoms in the network influence the charge distribution of the adjacent hydroxyl groups (Ti-OH). The electrostatic potential of the H-bond donor and acceptor could be effectively modulated by the Ti4+ and Ti3+ cations, thereby enhancing the H-bond strength. The resulting PTS SSG exhibits exceptional shear stiffening (~2800 times, 0.1–100 Hz), negligible corrosion, and low cytotoxicity (Grade 1). The PTS SSG is further explored for impact protection materials and flexible mechanical sensors in practice. The hydrogen bonding enhancement strategy also paves the way for developing dynamic reversible networks to fabricate next-generation smart materials.

 Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous risk loci associated with prostate cancer, yet unraveling their functional significance remains elusive. Leveraging our high-throughput SNPs-seq method, we pinpointed rs4519489 within the multi-ancestry GWAS-discovered 2p25 locus as a potential functional SNP due to its significant allelic differences in protein binding. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of rs4519489 and its associated gene, NOL10, employing diverse cohort data and experimental models. Clinical findings reveal a synergistic effect between rs4519489 genotype and NOL10 expression on prostate cancer prognosis and severity. Through unbiased proteomics screening, we reveal that the risk allele A of rs4519489 exhibits enhanced binding to USF1, an oncogenic transcription factor (TF) implicated in prostate cancer progression and prognosis, resulting in elevated NOL10 expression. Furthermore, we elucidate that NOL10 regulates cell cycle pathways, fostering prostate cancer progression. The concurrent expression of NOL10 and USF1 correlates with aggressive prostate cancer characteristics and poorer prognosis. Collectively, our study offers a robust strategy for functional SNP screening and TF identification through high-throughput SNPs-seq and unbiased proteomics, highlighting the rs4519489-USF1-NOL10 regulatory axis as a promising biomarker or therapeutic target for clinical diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.

Here, the authors report that chloroplast cysteine synthase complex regulates stomatal closure by integrating different stress signals via dynamically supplying cysteine for ABA biosynthesis. 
 Global warming intensifies drought and high light stress periods, causing severe water loss and decreased crop yield. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is the dominant signal governing stomatal closure and water loss. Here, we uncover three signaling axes triggered by soil dehydration and high light stress converging on the dynamic assembly of the cysteine-synthase-complex in chloroplasts (pCSC). We show that pCSC assembly triggers ABA biosynthesis and stomatal closure in response to the soil-drying signals, sulfate (axis 1) and CLE25 (axis 2), and the high light-induced oxylipin OPDA (axis 3). Loss of the pCSC increases sensitivity to soil-drying and impairs high light-induced stomatal closure. Our findings uncover that the dynamic assembly of the pCSC acts as a sensor hub, integrating local and long-distance stress signals to promote stomatal closure by supplying cysteine for ABA biosynthesis in guard cells. We applied this knowledge to generate a soil-drying resilient plant showing no growth penalty. Cysteine supply is crucial for ABA biosynthesis in plants.

 Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a new knob to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys. This study reveals that traditional manufacturing can create nonequilibrium short-range order in metallic alloys, offering an additional dimension for tailoring alloy properties beyond composition and microstructure."

 Ferroelectric crystals have emerged as promising candidates for exotic optoelectronic platforms. However, the wide bandgaps of transparent ferroelectric crystals restrict their ultraviolet optical activity, hindering broadband photoelectric conversion. Herein, a hierarchical defect engineering strategy is proposed for ferroelectric oxides to achieve full-spectrum optical absorption and boost broadband self-powered photodetection. Based on the transparent calcium barium niobate crystal, red Ce:CSBN is designed through the cooperative isovalent substitution of Sr2+ and aliovalent substitution of Ce3+. Furthermore, a black Ce:CSBN crystal is fabricated via thermal reduction, which demonstrated ultra-broadband absorption from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared range. This extended absorption capability is attributed to the judiciously modulated oxygen vacancies. Consequently, self-powered photodetection is realized in the 250–5000 nm range with a high responsivity of >1 mA/W, representing the widest responsive range among all-known ferroelectric detectors. More impressively, a reversible red-black transition is achieved by controlling oxygen vacancy concentration.

 During the Last Glacial Maximum, changes in the thickness of the Patagonian Ice Sheet modified southern Andean topography. However, the resulting atmospheric feedbacks remain poorly constrained. Using an atmosphere–land coupled model, we isolated the climate response to prescribed ice-sheet thicknesses. Our results indicate that a thicker ice sheet generates a decrease in low level zonal winds, a westward shift in precipitation, a temperature increase along the western margin of Eastern Patagonia, and an increase in storm activity over Patagonia. A decrease in thickness generates the opposite pattern.

 Vegetables are central to sustainable food systems and healthy diets, yet climate adaptation research in agriculture has largely focused on staple crops, with less emphasis on vegetable farming systems. We conducted a systematic review of 60 studies to map adaptation responses in vegetable farming systems across Africa and explore how these responses address climate risks. Most adaptation efforts are concentrated in rural areas of Western and Eastern Africa, and primarily address water-related hazards, including drought, flooding, and erratic precipitation. Technological responses dominated, followed by behavioural responses and ecosystem-based while institutional options were relatively underreported. Urban agriculture, despite its importance for employment, income and food and nutrition security, remains underexplored. Only one-third of the studies assessed the effectiveness of adaptation, mostly through efficiency and utilitarian framing.

 Parent material shapes soil properties, yet its effects on soil functions and microbial networks remain unclear. Here we investigate these relationships using a large-scale field survey comparing soils derived from calcium-rich carbonate rocks and calcium-poor clastic rocks, complemented by a microcosm experiment. Soils from calcium-rich parent materials contained 33% higher organic carbon, 58% higher total nitrogen, and 55% higher total phosphorus than calcium-poor soils, yet lower labile carbon and several hydrolytic enzyme activities, with similar water retention. Calcium-rich soils exhibited greater bacterial network complexity, which associated with enhanced soil functions. Within calcium-rich soils, rock and soil calcium were primary drivers of increased carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage and bacterial network complexity. The microcosm experiment confirmed that calcium-rich rock addition stimulated soil carbon and nitrogen cycling and enhanced bacterial network complexity, even in calcium-rich soils. These findings indicate calcium-rich parent materials can play a pivotal role in improving soil ecosystem services.

 Lake ice, a significant indicator of global warming, plays a crucial role in regulating regional hydroclimate and maintaining lake ecosystem balance, in particular for the fragile high-mountain environment in Asia. However, the spatiotemporal variability of ice thickness in glacial lakes remains elusive due to limited and inconsistent observations, as well as the lack of a comprehensive glacial lake ice model that effectively couples ice layer dynamics with multiple physical fields, such as atmosphere and lake water. Although efforts have been made in applying lake ice model based on climate model outputs, the estimation of lake ice thickness largely overlooks the actual frozen lake conditions and remains constrained to highly glaciated regions. Therefore, a systematical method for automatically extracting ice-covered area and estimating the ice thickness in glacial lakes is critically needed. Here we employed SDGSAT-1 MII images to meticulously delineate ice coverage regions, and harnessed CryoSat-2 waveforms to derive ice thickness in glacial lakes across Himalaya. Then we proposed a novel lake ice model that was cross-validated by altimetric measurements, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.25 m for the whole Himalaya, to give a reliable estimation of ice thickness for 64 Himalayan glacial lakes large than 1 km2. The maximum mean ice thickness during 2010–2024 is 2.5 m, observed in Western Himalaya. Approximately 80 % of lakes are experiencing statistically significant reductions in ice thickness. The fastest decrease in lake ice thickness occurs in the Eastern Himalaya (up to 0.08 m/yr), and the thinning rates in the Western and Central Himalayas are comparatively lower, with the maximum values of 0.04 m/yr and 0.07 m/yr, respectively. Further investigations show that the associated lower ice is primarily driven by the notably rising temperature and accelerated glacier ablation. This research enhances the interpretations of SDGSAT-1 imagery signal from frozen glacial lakes, offering new possibilities for broader applications of SDGSAT-1 in cryospheric studies."

 Climate change is projected to intensify water stress in many ecosystems and poses threats to their stability, which can be quantified through ecosystem resistance and resilience. Relevant studies mostly focused on multi-year or annual droughts, and in spatially homogeneous or species-specific ecosystems. However, resilience and resistance within complex ecosystems, where different plants exhibit different adaptations and recovery behaviours, are less understood. Using productivity data from satellite-derived GOSIF (Global Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 Solar-Induced Fluorescence) and flux towers, we examined vegetation responses to short-term (<1 year) water stress events from 2000 to 2018 along the North Australia Tropical Transect, which spans a 1600 mm rainfall gradient and transitions from seasonal mesic to non-seasonal arid ecosystems. We define resistance as productivity maintained during stress relative to a multi-year average baseline, and resilience as the extent to which productivity recovered one year after stress relative to the same baseline. Our results show that ecosystem resistance to water stress was lowest in semi-arid regions but higher in both arid and mesic regions, while ecosystem resilience showed the opposite pattern. These spatial patterns occurred regardless of seasonality and were mainly associated with dominant vegetation type. Woody savanna-dominated mesic regions exhibited highest resistance (0.82 ± 0.13, p < 0.001) and lowest resilience (0.26 ± 0.19, p < 0.001), shrublands in arid areas had intermediate values of both resistance (0.81 ± 0.14, p < 0.001) and resilience (0.27 ± 0.22, p < 0.001), while the grasslands in semi-arid regions had low resistance (0.78 ± 0.15, p < 0.001) and high resilience (0.38 ± 0.24, p < 0.001). The highest likelihood (>75.0 %) of full recovery (i.e., exceeding baseline after one year) occurred during the wet season in mesic regions, likely due to energy limitation, while arid regions showed a lower likelihood (57.0 %). This study provides a remote sensing framework for quantifying ecosystem resistance and resilience under water stress."

 Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) plays a critical role in coastal zone management, navigation safety, and marine environmental monitoring. However, conventional SDB methods are constrained by limited depth penetration and reduced accuracy, largely driven by water optical properties, environmental variability, and sensor limitations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel bathymetric mapping framework that integrates wave-based indirect depth inversion from photon-counting LiDAR data with multi-source remote sensing data. Specifically, a novel Progressive Adaptive Window for Local Period (PAWLP) algorithm is developed to derive water depth from ICESat-2 surface waves. By dynamically adjusting the analysis window to local wave variations, PAWLP enhances inversion robustness based on linear wave theory. In addition, we construct a multi-source SDB random forest inversion model by fusing multispectral imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), tidal height, and tidal velocity. To further improve model generalizability and reduce scene-specific noise, a temporal sample transfer strategy is applied. In this study, the proposed methods are validated using in situ bathymetry data from the U.S. Virgin Islands (clear waters) and from Bar Harbor (turbid waters). Results show that PAWLP adaptively captures local wave characteristics to retrieve water depth, achieving an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.56 m and weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) of 10.01 %, with reductions of approximately 17.89 % in RMSE and 19.46 % in WMAPE compared to the fixed-period method. The proposed multi-source bathymetric inversion framework further improves prediction accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 1.64 m in clear waters and 2.32 m in turbid areas, outperforming traditional methods across diverse conditions. The integration of SAR data and tidal features substantially enhances prediction stability, particularly under optically complex waters. Overall, this study highlights the potential of wave-based indirect depth inversion to extend the effective depth range for SDB. By integrating ICESat-2 bathymetric measurements with multi-source remote sensing data and temporal sample transfer strategy, our method enhances mapping accuracy and spatial coverage, mitigates optical saturation effects, and provides a scalable solution for reliable bathymetric mapping across diverse coastal environments."

 Rice blast (RB), a devastating fungal disease, causes severe yield losses worldwide and demands accurate severity quantification for effective management. Remote sensing has been demonstrated useful in disease monitoring and offers a scalable solution, but the phenology challenges the robustness of the model built for spectroscopic severity quantification. Since the variations induced by phenology are closely confounded with the infection progression, it is crucial to identify the specific plant traits that explain the inconsistency in disease severity (DS) estimation while mitigating the phenological influence. To address this issue, this study proposed a novel approach by extending the PROSPECT+SAIL model to account for the optical effects induced in RB-infected rice plants. By introducing DS into PROSPECT simulations based on spectral mixture analysis and lesion optical measurements, the use of RB-extended PROSPECT decreased the leaf simulation errors by up to 36.3 % in the crucial spectral regions for RB monitoring. Subsequently, such an extension enabled the generation of synthetic datasets for disentangling phenological versus RB-induced physiological effects. The sensitivity and disentanglement analysis revealed that leaf chlorophyll content was the primary factor that compromises the relationship between DS and the rice blast index (RIBInir), which was designed for RB severity quantification. After correcting for these effects by normalizing RIBInir with an optimized chlorophyll-sensitive vegetation index (nRIBInir), estimation accuracies significantly improved with an increment of R2 from 0.67 to 0.79, and rRMSE decreased by 9 %, particularly for vegetative samples with mild infection (R2 increased by 0.51). Consequently, the proposed nRIBInir overcame the underestimation of severe infection areas in both severity quantification and spatial mapping. The adapted nRIBInir for drone and satellite sensors also exhibited great performance in DS estimation. Our findings suggest that RB-extended PROSAIL simulations facilitate mitigating the phenological influence with reliable validations and mechanistic interpretation. Moreover, the adaptation flexibility and robustness of nRIBInir ensured its potential in practical applications including resistance breeding, disease tracking, and precision fungicide management at various scales."

 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays a vital role in maintaining ecosystem balance and can have both beneficial and harmful effects on human health. Erythemal UV radiation (UVER), which is a weighted sum of UVA and UVB radiation, is directly linked to skin cancer in humans. Although satellite observations offer a useful tool to monitor UV radiation globally, current global satellite products have limitations such as coarse spatial/temporal resolutions and poor spatial/temporal continuity. To address this issue, we proposed a novel method to estimate all-sky UVER by establishing a practical parametric model between UVER and downward shortwave radiation (DSR), total ozone column (TOC), solar zenith angle (SZA), and elevation. A multiple scattering correction algorithm was also developed to improve the accuracy of UVER estimation over highly reflective surfaces. The UVER estimation was validated against 49 ground stations worldwide and showed high accuracy with R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 607.92 J/m2∙day, relative RMSE = 23.97 %, MBE = -81.32 J/m2∙day, relative MBE = -3.76 %.

 Accurate field-level rice yield prediction for an unseen year is valuable for optimizing precision farming practices and strengthening national food security frameworks. Although many studies have used vegetation indices or gross primary productivity (GPP) to predict crop yield, few have systematically evaluated their differences in predictive performance and stability using time series satellite imagery across the entire growing season. Simultaneously, little research has focused on field-level prediction for unseen years over large regions. To address these issues, we conducted an in-depth comparison between the Sentinel-2-derived normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) and high-resolution GPP generated via a modified two-leaf light use efficiency model in their correlations with rice yield. The optimal time window for yield prediction was identified using original and harmonic fitted GPP data at 10-day intervals. Additionally, cross-year GPP correction (CGC) was proposed as an efficient approach for model transfer to unseen years and compared with that of the adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA), an emerging data-driven domain transfer learning algorithm. Specifically, these methods were assessed with an extensive field-level rice yield dataset from eastern and northeastern China spanning 2019–2022.We found that GPP outperformed NDRE in predicting rice yield (individual monthly: ∆r2 = 0.04–0.29, cumulative monthly: ∆r2 = 0.22–0.41), with greater stability and reliability. Furthermore, the harmonic fitted GPP could improve the yield prediction accuracy. Additionally, the CGC method improved interannual prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.55–0.73) for the two regions, showing better predictive performance than the ADDA model (R2 = 0.54–0.62). The proposed method relied only on a limited amount of ground-truth yield samples and exhibited robust performance in years characterized by pronounced interannual yield variability (2019) or extreme weather conditions (2022). This research has great potential for implementing rice yield prediction over large regions with publicly available imagery and limited ground-truth yield data, particularly for smallholder farming systems in the context of precision crop management and food security assessment."

 The FireCCILT11 global burned area (BA) product, developed under the ESA Climate Change Initiative, spans nearly four decades (1982–2018) and is the longest nearly continuous global fire record currently available. Despite its growing use in high-profile studies, its performance has not been comprehensively evaluated. Moreover, while two earlier studies identified severe instrumental artifacts in the FireCCILT11 dataset, the supporting evidence in those studies was primarily circumstantial. Here, we directly assess FireCCILT11 BA using a suite of national fire history datasets and independently derived satellite-based BA products across eight countries. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in both the accuracy and consistency of FireCCILT11, particularly before 2001. FireCCILT11 frequently diverges from national records in terms of annual BA totals, exhibits poor spatial agreement at the pixel level, and suffers from high omission and commission errors. A pixelation effect further compromises its spatial resolution and usability. These findings suggest that FireCCILT11 is generally unsuitable for long-term fire regime analyses, especially in regions or periods not represented in its training data.

This paper introduces an Iterative Guiding Network (IGN) that uses an iteratively updated internal high-resolution HSI to guide the super-resolution (SR) process, rather than an external image. The iterative SR process gradually learns the features. Meanwhile, a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module is designed to fuse features at different scales, and Feature Injection Modules (FIMs) with two innovative components are designed to bridge the gap between the input image and the reference image, making deep use of the information both images convey. Contrary to the intuition that internal images do not bring auxiliary information, experimental data and performance analysis demonstrate that this approach improves reconstruction results.

 Evaluating long-term building reconstruction is essential to strengthen resilience to earthquakes. Field investigations provide detailed and accurate information for building assessments, but are often labour intensive, costly, and time consuming, particularly when considering the regional-scale impact of earthquakes. In contrast, satellite Remote Sensing (RS) techniques provide frequent data across vast areas, making them ideal for regional-scale post-earthquake assessments, which can complement field surveys. Despite this, most RS studies have relied on manual change detection of satellite data before and after the event, limiting their potential for automated assessment and reducing their support for field investigations. In this study, we developed a novel RS method designed to assist field investigations of post-earthquake building reconstruction on a regional scale. The method automatically identifies target buildings for field teams to investigate, locating collapsed structures or buildings that have changed due to post-earthquake reconstruction efforts. We applied Multi-Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) for the first time to evaluate post-earthquake building reconstruction. The proposed method involves a two-stage analysis: first, a grid-level assessment on a regional scale to detect areas with reconstruction activities following an earthquake, and then a detailed building-level analysis to identify individual buildings that have undergone changes as part of the reconstruction process within these areas. The method was used to assess building reconstruction efforts in Nepal after the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. For the MT-InSAR analysis, we acquired two stacks of 3-m-resolution SAR images, one before and one after the earthquake. The grid-level analysis detected multiple urban areas with significant changes, which were then subjected to a building-level analysis. This analysis pinpointed the locations of affected buildings and determined the extent of changes related to reconstruction activities. A comparison of the building-level results with field observations confirmed that the method successfully identified buildings that have undergone changes. These changes included buildings that were left in a collapsed state, demolished, under construction, or fully reconstructed. The MT-InSAR-based approach introduced in this study has the potential to serve as a valuable tool to guide future field surveys related to post-earthquake reconstruction, significantly reducing the time and effort needed for such assessment."

Remote sensing provides a useful means for scaling local, plot-measured fCover estimates to regional scales. Leveraging a recently synthesized and harmonized plot database, this study generated wall-to-wall maps of fCover for six Alaskan-Arctic plant functional types (PFT), including non-vascular plants, forbs, graminoids, and deciduous and evergreen shrubs, using 20-m satellite data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ArcticDEM) using a machine learning regression approach, specifically the random forest (RF) algorithm, which is well-suited for handling nonlinear relationships and high-dimensional satellite datasets. This study additionally addressed the spatio-temporal inconsistencies e.g., sampling scale, plot size, and collection year in plot measured fCover by adopting a multivariate outlier detection approach—Cook’s distance—to identify high-quality plots for model training and validation. Our approach achieves high accuracy (R2 = 0.59–0.93, root mean squared errors = 0.02–0.10 for all PFTs) between plot-observed and satellite-derived fCover when using high-quality plot samples.

 Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) contains a significant fraction of carbonaceous materials, which include organic- (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). These species significantly influence the global radiation balance and have negative health impacts. Although South Africa is an important emitter of carbonaceous aerosols, very little OC and EC studies have been published in the peer reviewed public domain. Therefore, the aim of this paper was augmenting the sparse OC and EC data for South Africa through a detailed assessment of an extensive dataset collected daily for 24 h over a period of 14 months at the regional background site, Welgegund. In total. 587 datasets were collected, which is the most comprehensive OC and EC dataset collected for this region. Seasonal OC and EC concentration patterns indicated significant contributions from open biomass burning in the months with highest fire frequencies, as well as contributions from household combustion during winter. In addition to these sources, the important influence of the industrial hub in the South African interior on OC and EC levels were also indicated. Meteorological conditions also contributed to increased OC and EC during the colder months. Since fire occurrences and population density decreased from east to west, OC and EC data associated with air masses mainly passing over eastern and western defined regions were compared. Although the differences were not as large as expected, statistical differences could be confirmed with air masses passing over the eastern region corresponding to higher OC and EC concentrations. Contextualization of OC and EC concentrations revealed OC and EC levels determined in this study were similar or slightly elevated compared to concentrations reported for other background sites. Furthermore, EC correlated well with equivalent black carbon (eBC), indicating that EC at this site can be used as a proxy for eBC at regional background sites."

 The Fenwei Plain (FWP) has experienced the most serious winter PM2.5 pollution in China since 2000. This study investigates causes behind interannual variability of wintertime PM2.5 concentration in the FWP during 2000–2021 and projects future trends through integrated observations, reanalysis data and simulations. The results show that the Eurasian-like (EUL) pattern is responsible for the interannual variability of PM2.5 concentration in the FWP, accounting for up to 55 % of the dominant pollution mode in the region. The EUL pattern modulates PM2.5 anomalies by causing higher relative humidity, more stable atmospheric stratification and anomalous southeasterly wind. Additionally, based on an EUL index, this study further projects that large-scale atmospheric circulation may exacerbate PM2.5 pollution in the FWP during 2035–2060. Specifically, the EUL pattern exhibits greater extremity and a higher frequency under high emission scenarios (i.e., 39.9 % in SSP585) compared to low emission scenarios (i.e., 19.9 % in SSP245), suggesting increased frequency of the EUL pattern and the associated PM2.5 pollution events in the FWP after 2035 in high emission scenarios. These insights provide scientific support for prevention and control of PM2.5 pollution in the FWP in winter."

 Wildland fires, including both wildfires and prescribed burns, emit large quantities of smoke containing hazardous air pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Understanding PAHs concentrations in these smoke-filled environments is key to developing effective mitigation strategies to protect public health and safety. However, conventional measurement strategies are not always feasible in the highly dynamic and logistically complex settings of wildfire events. As a result, alternative approaches are needed, such as the use of silicone wristbands (SWBs) as passive air samplers. In this study, PAHs were analyzed in SWBs worn by firefighters during prescribed burns and wildfires. After deployment, extraction, and GC-MS/MS analysis, PAH air concentrations were calculated using a compound-specific kinetic uptake model. Personal exposure to PAHs was task-specific: wildfire operators and torchers, who ignite the fires, experienced the highest concentrations (mean sum of PAHs ≈ 5000 ng/m3), followed by liners, who manage fire boundaries (≈2000 ng/m3), while truck drivers exhibited the lowest exposure concentrations (≈100 ng/m3), likely due to their roles keeping them farther from the smoke-dense areas. Additionally, to evaluate the SWBs’ ability to capture particle-bound PAHs, PAH air concentrations measured in SWBs were compared with those obtained from PM2.5 filter sampling. The findings highlight the utility of passive air sampling with SWBs in detecting PAHs and underscore their potential for monitoring exposure concentrations in complex atmospheric environments."

 This study aims at quantifying the effect of different aerosol types on sunburning solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, quantified by the UV Index (UVI), using global simulations with a radiative transfer model which are based on aerosol optical depth data derived from the GFDL-ESM4 model. The reductions in UV radiation due to the presence of aerosols show a strong regional variability, with the largest effect caused by organic aerosols and dust, followed by black carbon, while sulfates and sea salt have a minor influence. In the 1950s and 1990s decreases in the UVI are dominated by the presence of organic aerosols mainly over Western S. America (−3.9 UVI units) and South and East Asia (−1.9), as well as by dust in Northern Africa (−3.8). Despite its low optical depth (0.08), the effect of black carbon on UVI is significant in specific regions (e.g., Central Africa and South and East Asia in the 1950s and India in the 1990s.Aerosol decreases from the 1990s to the 2090s under the SSP1–2.6 scenario result in UVI increases, by up to ∼5 over South and East Asia due to decreases in organics and black carbon.

 The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), a densely populated and agriculturally productive region, experiences substantial emissions from industrial activities, vehicular traffic, and biomass burning. These emissions contribute to high aerosol loading and significant variability affecting the ultraviolet (UV) radiation, impacting air quality, climate, and public health. The present study employs Box-Jenkins, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to analyze and forecast the ultraviolet radiation (UVA and UVB) and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) using data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) over selected urban regions in the IGP. Time-series data from January 2005 to December 2020 (∼16 years) are utilized to capture seasonal patterns and long-term trends, enabling predictions for the next two years. Stationarity of UVA, UVB, and AOD data is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, followed by autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) analysis to determine the optimal model order. Model is fitted by estimating various parameters through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) optimization techniques and found suitable with (1,1,1)(1,1,1)12, considering a monthly seasonal factor for predicting UVA, UVB fluxes, and AOD. When SARIMA was used with exogenous variables for prediction of UVA, UVB and AOD it was found that different stations had different optimal configurations. The model validation involves error and comparative analyses. Error metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in the predicted data, indicate low errors. Comparative analysis shows strong agreement between modelled and CERES data, with significant correlation metrics such as the R-squared coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient (r), degree of agreement (DOA), and Taylor skill score (TSS). Model accuracy is further assessed using normalized Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), while model adequacy is evaluated through Ljung-Box and Jarque-Bera tests. Results indicate a strong seasonal dependence of UV radiation and AOD, with peaks during pre-monsoon and winter months, respectively. The SARIMA model effectively captures temporal variability and provides very good forecast for time series data valuable to researchers in air quality management and climate mitigation."

 Various initialization procedures have proven beneficial for improving tropical cyclone (TC) prediction, yet numerous challenges remain. This study first employs the dynamical initialization (DI) method to enhance the initial TC intensity, and subsequently assesses the effectiveness of assimilating radiance data from the Microwave Humidity Sounder II (MWHS-2) and the Microwave Temperature Sounder III (MWTS-3) onboard the Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) satellite, along with the conventional data. A case study on Typhoon Doksuri is conducted using the Hybrid EnKF-3DVAR method for a 48-h forecast. Results demonstrate that the DI scheme not only strengthens the initial vortex, but also improves both track and intensity forecasts. On the basis of DI, assimilating both conventional and microwave data can further refine the initial conditions, thereby reducing forecast errors. More specifically, assimilating conventional data yields the best performance in track forecasting, while simultaneously assimilating conventional data, MWHS-2, and MWTS-3 radiance remarkably refines both thermodynamic and dynamic variables in the initial fields, resulting in the most accurate prediction of minimum sea level pressure (MSLP). Moreover, the DI rectifies the distribution of 24-h accumulated extreme rainfall after landfall in Fujian Province, China, but underestimates the rainfall intensity. However, additionally assimilating MWHS-2 radiance data enhances the forecast of severe precipitation especially over 400 mm. These findings support that combining DI with data assimilation (DA) can further improve initial conditions and thus TC forecasts. In conclusion, the credibility of FY-3E microwave radiance assimilation in reducing forecast errors, particularly the efficacy of MWHS-2 radiance in heavy rainfall forecasts, has also been proved."

 Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is identified as key sources of skill in winter subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts because of their surface impacts lasting up to 30–60 days through stratosphere troposphere coupling, despite their typical prediction being limited about 10 days. A better understanding of the predictability of the SSW itself, thus, is fundamental. Most of the previous studies investigate the predictability of SSW events using linear approaches, which are insufficient given the inherently chaotic and nonlinear nature of SSWs. In the study, we apply a nonlinear method—Backward Searching for the Initial Condition (BaSIC)—to quantify the local predictability limit the 2021 SSW event, which caused cold extremes across East Asia and North America. Using ERA5 reanalysis and the S2S reforecasts data, BaSIC estimates the maximum prediction lead time of this 2021 SSW event to be 17 days. To explore sensitive region of forecast uncertainty, we identify regions of fastest error growth via error tracking in S2S systems using BaSIC method. Forecast errors during the SSW event are small across the polar stratosphere after initiation but grow gradually over two weeks, accelerating rapidly over central Eurasia (30°-60°E) and spreading across the continent. This points to central Eurasia at high altitudes as a critical region for SSW forecast error development."

The East Asian trough and the Indo-Burma trough are also pronounced. The activities of the East Asian Winter Monsoon system are stronger than that of purely extreme cold events (ECEs)  over mid-and high latitudes, whereas weaker over mid-and low latitudes. This dynamic facilitates cold air intrusion and significant moisture transport, resulting in high frequency ECPEs. •Compared to M2, besides Siberia, M1 and M3 have additional cold air sources and a shared water vapor channel from the tropical Indian Ocean. Weaker convergences between southerlies and northerlies results in a lower frequency of ECPEs for M1 and M3. 
 Based on CN05.1 and ERA5 datasets, K-means clustering identified three atmospheric circulation patterns during extreme cold-precipitation compound events (ECPEs) in southern China from December to February (DJF) during 1979 to 2022. The second mode (M2) occurs most frequently and has the most spacious impact, which featured a mid-high latitudes one-ridge-one-trough pattern at 500 hPa, with persistent cold air from prolonged maintenance blocking ridge over Lake Baikal. Concurrently, the western northward-shifted western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and an active Bay of Bengal Trough enhanced southerly moisture transport from the tropical Pacific Ocean and tropical Indian Ocean, respectively, facilitating precipitation. This saddle-type circulation weakened mid-low latitudes cold air intrusion further to south but enhanced moisture transportation and upper-level divergence, triggering the development during ECPEs in southern China. Comparative analysis revealed that purely extreme cold events (ECEs) demonstrated significant correlation with intensified East Asian winter monsoons, characterized by a persistently extended East Asian trough and prolonged maintenance of the Lake Baikal ridge without active circulation anomalies over mid-low latitudes. This synoptic configuration facilitated enhanced southward penetration of cold air masses, resulting in more pronounced temperature drops across southern China compared with ECPEs. And southern China is located at the entrance of the upper-level jet, and during ECPEs, the jet core of the upper-level shifts more westward with stronger horizontal wind shear and divergence than during ECEs. This configuration facilitates ascent, thereby leading to extreme precipitation over the region. In addition, the first mode (M1) and the third mode (M3) are further studied by comparing with M2, as they have different sources of cold air and water vapor channel from the tropical Indian Ocean through the Indochina Peninsula to southern China. Therefore, M1 and M3 lead to less frequent ECPEs than M2."
