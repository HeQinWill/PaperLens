The CH4 concentrations were mapped against the emissions in the agro-climatic zones, and a statistically high correlation was found in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region. 
 Atmospheric methane (CH4) is a potent climate change agent responsible for a fraction of global warming. The present study investigated the spatiotemporal variability of atmospheric-column-averaged CH4  (XCH4)  concentrations using data from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P/TROPOMI) from 2009 to 2022 over the south Asian region. During the study period, the long-term trends in XCH4 increased from 1700 to 1950 ppb, with an annual growth rate of 8.76 ppb yr−1. Among all natural and anthropogenic sources of CH4, the rate of increase in XCH4 was higher over the coal site at about 10.15 ± 0.55 ppb yr−1 (Paschim Bardhaman) followed by Mundra Ultra Mega Power Project at about 9.72 ± 0.41 ppb yr−1. Most of the wetlands exhibit an annual trend of XCH4 of more than 9.50 ppb yr−1, with a minimum rate of 8.72 ± 0.3 ppb yr−1 over Wular Lake. The WetCHARTs-based emissions of CH4 from the wetlands were minimal during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons. Maximum CH4 emissions were reported during the monsoon, with a maximum value of 23.62 ± 3.66 mg m−2 per month over the Sundarbans Wetland. For the 15 Indian agroclimatic zones, significant high emissions of CH4 were observed over the Middle Gangetic Plain, Trans-Gangetic Plain, Upper Gangetic Plain, Eastern Coastal Plains, Lower Gangetic Plain, and East Gangetic Plain. Further, the bottom-up anthropogenic CH4 emissions data are mapped against the XCH4 concentrations, and a high correlation was found in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region, indicating the hotspots of anthropogenic CH4."
10.5194/acp-24-12861-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文主要关注大气中挥发性有机物（VOCs）的源解析问题。由于VOCs的反应性损失，导致源解析结果存在偏差，低估了某些排放源的贡献。文章综述了目前减少反应性损失的常用方法、存在的问题以及对源解析结果的影响，并提出了改进方向。其中，正矩阵分解（PMF）是目前主要的源解析方法，但其数据预处理过程需要考虑VOCs的反应性损失。文章指出，目前基于光化学老化的方法仅考虑了VOCs与•OH自由基的反应，忽略了温度的影响以及与O3和NO3自由基的反应，因此精度有限。未来研究方向包括开发更准确的反应性损失定量方法，以及对消耗的VOCs进行源解析，准确量化不同排放源对臭氧和二次有机气溶胶的贡献。 这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为准确的VOCs源解析需要依赖于大气成分分析，例如地面监测和卫星观测数据，以获得准确的VOCs浓度和时空分布信息，从而更好地进行源解析和空气质量监测。,"['Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Ozone', 'Secondary organic aerosols', 'Source apportionment', 'Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF)']",Baoshuang Liu;Yao Gu;Yutong Wu;Qili Dai;Shaojie Song;Yinchang Feng;Philip K. Hopke,"Review of source analyses of ambient volatile organic compounds considering reactive losses: methods of reducing loss effects, impacts of losses, and sources","Reactive loss of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a long-term issue yet to be resolved in VOC source analyses. We assess common methods of, and existing issues in, reducing losses, impacts of losses, and sources in current source analyses. We offer a potential supporting role for solving issues of VOC conversion. Source analyses of consumed VOCs that reacted to produce ozone and secondary organic aerosols can play an important role in the effective control of secondary pollution in air. 
 Chemical losses of ambient reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a long-term issue yet to be resolved in VOC source apportionments. These losses substantially reduce the concentrations of highly reactive species in the apportioned factor profiles and result in the underestimation of source contributions. This review assesses the common methods and existing issues in ways to reduce losses and loss impacts in source analyses and suggests research directions for improved VOC source apportionments. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) is now the main VOC source analysis method compared to other mathematical models. The issue in using any apportionment tool is the processing of the data to be analyzed to reduce the impacts of reactive losses. Estimating the initial concentrations of ambient VOCs based on photochemical age has become the primary approach to reduce reactive loss effects in PMF, except for selecting low-reactivity species or nighttime data into the analysis. Currently, the initial concentration method only considers daytime reactions with hydroxyl (•OH) radicals. However, the •OH rate constants vary with temperature, and that has not been considered. Losses from reactions with O3 and NO3 radicals, especially for alkene species, remain to be included. Thus, the accuracy of the photochemical age estimation is uncertain. Beyond developing accurate quantitative approaches for reactive losses, source analyses methods for the consumed VOCs and the accurate quantification of different source contributions to O3 and secondary organic aerosols are important additional directions for future research."

The results underscore the good agreement with isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements and the ability of the instrument to monitor biological processes. 
 Atmospheric dioxygen (O2) concentration and isotopic composition are closely linked to the carbon cycle through anthropic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. The measurement of the isotopic ratio of O2, trapped in ice core bubbles, brings information about past variation in the hydrological cycle at low latitudes, as well as past productivity. Currently, the interpretation of those variations could be drastically improved with a better (i.e., quantitative) knowledge of the oxygen isotopic fractionation that occurs during photosynthesis and respiration processes. This could be achieved, for example, during experiments using closed biological chambers. In order to estimate the isotopic fractionation coefficient with good precision, one of the principal limitations is the need for high-frequency online measurements of isotopic composition of O2, expressed as δ18O of O2 (δ18O(O2)) and O2 concentration. To address this issue, we developed a new instrument, based on the optical-feedback cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (OF-CEAS) technique, enabling high-temporal-resolution and continuous measurements of O2 concentration as well as δ18O(O2), both simultaneously. The minimum Allan deviation occurred between 10 and 20 min,  while precision reached 0.002 % for the O2 concentration and 0.06 ‰ for δ18O(O2), which correspond to the optimal integration time and analytical precision before instrumental drift started degrading the measurements. Instrument accuracy was in good agreement with dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Measured values were slightly affected by humidity, and we decided to measure δ18O(O2) and O2 concentration after drying the gas. On the other hand, a 1 % increase in O2 concentration increased the δ18O(O2) by 0.53 ‰. To ensure the good quality of O2 concentration and δ18O(O2) measurements we eventually proposed to measure the calibration standard every 20 min."

 Thermodynamic profiles in the atmospheric boundary layer can be retrieved from ground-based passive remote sensing instruments like infrared spectrometers and microwave radiometers with optimal-estimation physical retrievals. With a high temporal resolution on the order of minutes, these thermodynamic profiles are a powerful tool to study the evolution of the boundary layer and to evaluate numerical models. In this study, we describe three recent modifications to the Tropospheric Remotely Observed Profiling via Optimal Estimation (TROPoe) retrieval framework, which improve the availability of valid solutions for different atmospheric conditions and increase the temporal consistency of the retrieved profiles. We present methods to enhance the availability of valid solutions retrieved from infrared spectrometers by preventing overfitting and by adding information from an additional spectral band in high-moisture environments. We show that the characterization of the uncertainty of the input and the choice of spectral infrared bands are crucial for retrieval performance. Since each profile is retrieved independently from the previous one, the time series of the thermodynamic variables contain random uncorrelated noise, which may hinder the study of diurnal cycles and temporal tendencies. By including a previous retrieved profile as input to the retrieval, we increase the temporal consistency between subsequent profiles without suppressing real mesoscale atmospheric variability. We demonstrate that these modifications work well at midlatitudes, polar and tropical sites, and for retrievals based on infrared spectrometer and microwave radiometer measurements."

This way, we can significantly improve greenhouse gas monitoring with little extra instrumental effort. Slow-response analysers may be used here as the relevant frequency ranges depend on measuring height. Tall towers offer a large footprint, amplifying spatial coverage. The presented concept is a valuable bridge between atmospheric and ecosystem communities. 
 Greenhouse gas monitoring is important to ensure climate goals are being achieved. This study unveils the potential of using atmospheric tall towers in direct flux measurements, bridging the gap between atmospheric and ecosystem monitoring networks. The ICOS Cities (PAUL) project aims to monitor CO2 emissions in urban areas, where concentrated emissions make them key targets for climate change mitigation. This study explores the synergy between ICOS atmospheric and ecosystem networks by utilizing slow-response analysers (∼ 3 s) on tall atmospheric towers for ecosystem studies using the eddy covariance method. A standard setup with an ultrasonic anemometer and an infrared (IR) fast-response CO2 analyser was installed and compared with measurements from an existing cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyser measuring CO2, CO, and CH4. Deployed on the 100 m Saclay tower near Paris, covering a 43.9 km2 80 % footprint with heavy traffic roads, a nearby heating plant, and a forest, the setup addressed technical challenges and height-induced complexities. Corrections for flux attenuation by high-frequency losses were limited to < 20 % on average for all stabilities and around 11 % for unstable conditions. Elevated mean fluxes for CO2 (10 µmolm-2s-1) and CH4 (200 µmolm-2s-1) were observed from the heating plant wind direction during December and January. Conversely, the forest direction exhibited the strongest sink among all wind directions, with −4 µmolm-2s-1 during July and August. Storage and vertical advection were estimated using the routine three-level profile measurements done in ICOS atmospheric towers. Storage term was of the same magnitude as turbulent flux, increasing at night and de-stocking during the first half of the day. Vertical advection averaged zero on a monthly basis. These results demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of utilizing atmospheric towers for urban emission monitoring, offering valuable insights for emission monitoring strategies worldwide."

Adams,Tomographic reconstruction algorithms for retrieving two-dimensional ice cloud microphysical parameters using along-track (sub)millimeter-wave radiometer observations,"This paper presents our latest development in tomographic cloud reconstruction algorithms that use multi-angle TB observations to reconstruct the spatial distribution of ice clouds. Compared to nadir-only retrievals, the tomographic technique provides a detailed reconstruction of ice clouds’ inner structure with high spatial resolution and significantly improves retrieval accuracy. Also, the tomography technique effectively increases detection sensitivity for small ice cloud particles. 
 The submillimeter-wave radiometer operating in the along-track scanning mode continuously collects brightness temperature (TB) data over a two-dimensional (2D) cloud cross-section as the platform moves forward. TB observations from multiple positions and viewing angles show great promise in better constraining the 2D cloud microphysical properties compared to single-angle observations. In this study, we develop two types of tomographic reconstruction algorithms to retrieve 2D ice water content (IWC) profiles using multi-angle TB observations. The one-dimensional (1D) tomographic algorithm performs 1D retrievals beam by beam using each TB observation at a specific position and angle to derive cloud properties along the propagation path. It then integrates the 1D retrieval results to construct 2D cloud distributions. The 2D tomographic algorithm directly constrains the 2D cloud microphysical properties using multi-angle scanning TB observations. Starting with an initial assumption, the algorithm iteratively refines the 2D cloud microphysical quantities by minimizing discrepancies between TB simulations and observations under prior constraints. Both tomographic algorithms are developed based on a hybrid of Bayesian Monte Carlo Integration (MCI) and Optimal Estimation Method (OEM). A simulation experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of two tomographic reconstruction algorithms. The experiment demonstrates stable convergence of both tomographic methods, with the 2D tomographic algorithm exhibiting superior performance. The experiment results highlight the significant advantage of using multi-angle observations to constrain 2D cloud structure. Compared to nadir-only retrievals, the tomographic technique provides a detailed reconstruction of ice clouds’ inner structure with high spatial resolution. Also, the technique significantly improves retrieval accuracy by correcting systematic biases and reducing the derivation of retrieval errors. Furthermore, the tomography technique effectively increases detection sensitivity for small ice cloud particles."

This methodology considers the interference of atmospheric temperature, humidity, and surface temperature on SO2 detection and retrieval, laying the groundwork for developing a more accurate and flexible volcanic SO2 retrieval algorithm under different atmospheric conditions. 
 The Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Type II (HIRAS-II) aboard the Fengyun 3E (FY-3E) satellite provides valuable data on the vertical distribution of atmospheric states. However, effectively extracting quantitative atmospheric information from the observations is challenging due to the large number of hyperspectral sensor channels, inter-channel correlations, associated observational errors, and susceptibility of the results to influence by trace gases. This study explores the potential of FY-3E/HIRAS-II to atmospheric loadings of SO2 from volcanic eruption. A methodology for selecting SO2 sensitive channels from the large number of hyperspectral channels recorded by FY-3E/HIRAS-II is presented. The methodology allows for the selection of SO2-sensitive channels that contain similar information on variations in atmospheric temperature and water vapor for minimizing the influence of atmospheric water vapor and temperature to SO2. A sensitivity study shows that the difference in brightness temperature between the experimentally selected SO2 sensitive channels and the background channels effectively removes interference signals from surface temperature, atmospheric temperature, and water vapor during SO2 detection and inversion. A positive difference between near-surface atmospheric temperature and surface temperature enables the infrared band to capture more SO2 information in the lower and middle layers. The efficacy of FY-3E/HIRAS-II SO2 sensitive channels in quantitively monitor volcanic SO2 is demonstrated using data from the 29 April 2024 eruption of Mount Ruang in Indonesia. Using FY-3E/HIRAS-II measurements, the spatial distribution and quantitatively information of volcanic SO2 are easily observed. The channel selection can significantly enhance the computation efficiency while maintain the accuracy of SO2 detection and retrieval, despite the large volume of data."

 Continuous monitoring of shoreline dynamics is essential to understanding the drivers of shoreline changes and evolution. A long-term shoreline dataset can describe the dynamic changes in the spatio-temporal dimension and provide information on the influence of anthropogenic activities and natural factors on coastal areas. This study, conducted on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, analyzed the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of China's shorelines, including those of Hainan and Taiwan, from 1990 to 2019 using a long time series of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. First, we constructed a time series of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) with high-quality reconstruction by the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm. Second, the Otsu algorithm was used to separate the land and water of coastal areas based on MNDWI value at high-tide levels. Finally, a 30-year shoreline dataset was generated and a shoreline change analysis was conducted to characterize length change, area change, and rate of change. We concluded the following: (1) China's shoreline has shown an increasing trend in the past 30 years, with varying growth patterns across regions; the total shoreline length increased from 24 905.55 km in 1990 to 25 391.34 km in 2019, with a total increase greater than 485.78 km, a rate of increase of 1.95 %, and an average annual increasing rate of 0.07 %.

 The surface elevation of the Greenland Ice Sheet is constantly changing due to the interplay between surface mass balance processes and ice dynamics, each exhibiting distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Here, we employ satellite and airborne altimetry data with fine spatial (1 km) and temporal (monthly) resolutions to document this spatiotemporal evolution from January 2003 to August 2023.

We produce continuous monthly ice surface elevation changes from January 2003 to August 2023 on a 1 km grid covering the entire GIS. We estimate cumulative ice loss of 4,352 Gt ± 315 Gt (12.1 ± 0.9 mm sea level equivalent) during this period, excluding peripheral glaciers. Between 2003 and 2023, the ice sheet land-terminating margin underwent a significant cumulative thinning of several meters. Ocean-terminating glaciers exhibited thinning between 20–40 m, with Jakobshavn Isbræ experiencing an exceptional thinning of nearly 70 m. This dataset of fine-resolution altimetry data in both space and time will support studies of ice mass loss and useful for GIS ice sheet modelling. To validate our monthly mass changes of the Greenland ice sheet, we use mass change from satellite gravimetry and mass change from the Input-Output method.

 Dust storms pose significant risks to health and property, necessitating accurate forecasting for preventive measures. Despite advancements, dust models grapple with uncertainties arising from emission and transport processes. Data assimilation addresses these by integrating observations to rectify model error, enhancing forecast precision. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a widely used assimilation algorithm that effectively optimize model states, particularly in terms of intensity adjustment. However, the EnKF's efficacy is challenged by position errors between modeled and observed dust features, especially under substantial position errors. This study introduces the valid time shifting ensemble Kalman filter (VTS-EnKF), which combines stochastic EnKF with a valid time shifting mechanism. By recruiting additional ensemble members from neighboring valid times, this method not only accommodates variations in dust load but also explicitly accounts for positional uncertainties. Consequently, the enlarged ensemble better represents both the intensity and positional errors, thereby optimizing the utilization of observational data. The proposed VTS-EnKF was evaluated against two severe dust storm cases from spring 2021, demonstrating that position errors notably deteriorated forecast performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized mean bias (NMB), impeding the EnKF's effective assimilation. Conversely, the VTS-EnKF improved both the analysis and forecast accuracy compared to the conventional EnKF. Additionally, to provide a more rigorous assessment of its performance, experiments were conducted using fewer ensemble members and different time intervals."

Stevenson;Mark A. Sutton,A dynamical process-based model for quantifying global agricultural ammonia emissions – AMmonia–CLIMate v1.0 (AMCLIM v1.0) – Part 1: Land module for simulating emissions from synthetic fertilizer use,"A special model called AMmonia–CLIMate (AMCLIM) has been developed to understand and calculate NH3 emissions from fertilizer use and also taking into account how the environment influences these NH3 emissions. It is estimated that about 17 % of applied N in fertilizers was lost due to NH3 emissions. Hot and dry conditions and regions with high-pH soils can expect higher NH3 emissions. 
 Ammonia (NH3) emissions mainly originate from agricultural practices and can have multiple adverse impacts on the environment. With the substantial increase in synthetic fertilizer use over the past decades, volatilization of NH3 has become a major loss of N applied to land. Since NH3 can be strongly influenced by both environmental conditions and local management practices, a better estimate of NH3 emissions from fertilizer use requires improved understanding of the relevant processes. This study describes a new process-based model, AMmonia–CLIMate (AMCLIM), for quantifying agricultural NH3 emissions. More specifically, the present paper focuses on the development of a module (AMCLIM–Land) that is used for simulating NH3 emissions from synthetic fertilizer use. Other modules, together termed as AMCLIM-Livestock, simulate NH3 emissions from agricultural livestock and are described in Part 2). AMCLIM–Land dynamically models the evolution of N species in soils by incorporating the effects of both environmental factors and management practices to determine the NH3 emissions released from the land to the atmosphere. Based on simulations for 2010, NH3 emissions resulting from the synthetic fertilizer use are estimated at 15.0 Tg N yr−1, accounting for around 17 % of applied fertilizer N. Strong spatial and seasonal variations are found. Higher emissions typically occur in agriculturally intensive countries (such as China, India, Pakistan and the US) and mostly reach the maximum in the summer season. Volatilization rates indicate that hotter environments can result in more N lost due to NH3 emissions and show how other factors including soil moisture and pH can greatly affect volatilization of NH3. The AMCLIM model also allows for estimation of how application techniques and fertilizer type have impacts on the NH3 emissions, pointing to the importance of improving management practices to tackle nutrient loss and of appropriate data gathering to record management practices internationally."

 We developed a strongly coupled chemistry meteorology four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) assimilation system, CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var, for investigating the feedbacks of chemical data assimilation on meteorological forecasts. This system was developed on the basis of the framework of the incremental analysis scheme of the China Meteorological Administration Global Forecasting System (CMA-GFS). CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var includes three component models: forward, tangent linear, and adjoint models. CMA-GFS-AERO forward model was constructed by integrating an aerosol module containing main physical processes of black carbon (BC) aerosol in the atmosphere into the CMA-GFS weather model. The tangent linear and the adjoint of the aerosol module was further developed and coupled online with the CMA-GFS tangent linear and adjoint models, respectively. In CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var, the BC mass concentration was used as the control variable and minimized together with atmospheric variables. The validation of this system includes the tangent linear approximation, the adjoint correctness test, the single-point observation ideal experiment and the full observation experiment. The results show that CMA-GFS-AERO tangent linear model performs well in tangent linear approximation for BC, and adjoint sensitivity agrees well with tangent linear sensitivity. Assimilating BC observations can generate analysis increments not only for BC but also for atmospheric variables, highlighting the capability of CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var in exploring the feedback effect of BC assimilation on atmospheric variables.

Its structure is informed by the physical and chemical principles of the atmosphere, allowing it to learn and replicate complex atmospheric processes. FastCTM demonstrated matching accuracy to traditional models with less computational demand. It also provides analysis of how different atmospheric processes contribute to air quality changes. 
 Chemical transport models (CTM) have wide and profound applications in air quality simulations and managements. However, its applications are often constrained by high computational burdens. In this study, we developed a neural network based CTM model (FastCTM) to efficiently simulate ten air pollutant composition variables, including major PM2.5 species of SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, organic matters and other inorganic components, coarse part of PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3. The FastCTM has a principle-informed structure by explicitly encoding atmospheric physical and chemical processes in a basic simulator. Specifically, in the simulator, five neural network modules are proposed to respectively represent five major atmospheric processes of primary emissions, transport, diffusion, chemical reactions and depositions. Given 1-hour initial condition data, the FastCTM is able to simulate future 24-hour concentrations of the ten air pollutants with corresponding meteorology fields and emissions as input. The FastCTM is trained with operational forecast data from a numerical CTM model named Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) in 2018–2022. The well-trained FastCTM is evaluated comparing to the long-term CMAQ forecast in an independent year 2023, and achieves high agreements with mean RMSE values of 9.1, 11.9, 4.4, 4.0, 48.9 and 10.9 μg/m3 and R2 values of 0.8, 0.81, 0.8, 0.83, 0.9 and 0.7 for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. Besides, assessed against hourly site observations of six criteria pollutants, the RMSE values of FastCTM have small relative differences of 4.3 %, 4.2 %, -2.8 %, -1.7 %, -0.3 % and -3.2 % compared to that of CMAQ. The FastCTM model also exhibited reasonable responses of air quality to meteorological variables of air temperature, wind speed and planetary boundary layer height, as well as to input pollutant emissions. Furthermore, due to the principles-oriented structure, internal process analysis could be performed by FastCTM to quantify the specific contribution from each of the five processes for hourly air pollutant concentration changes. In a nutshell, FastCTM has multi-functional advantages in air pollutant concentration simulations, sensitivity analysis and internal process analysis with high computation efficiencies on GPU and accuracy.

We focused on a probabilistic approach, optimizing the model and retrieving quantities with their respective uncertainty. Considering future application to Big Data, we also explored a Neural Network based method, retrieving computationally efficient estimates, maintaining consistency with the analytical expression. 
 Within the New Copernicus Capability for Trophic Ocean Networks (NECCTON) project, we aim to improve the current data assimilation system by developing a method for accurately estimating marine optical constituents from satellite-derived Remote Sensing Reflectance. We developed and compared two frameworks by implicitly inverting a semi-analytical expression derived from the classical Radiative Transfer Equation. First, we used a Bayesian estimation, which provided retrievals of the optical constituents along with their uncertainties. Moreover, using historical in-situ measurements together with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to adjust the model parameters, we were able to reduce the root mean square Error (RMSE) between the retrieved data and in-situ observations. Second, we employed the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) framework to efficiently approximate the Maximum Posterior (MAP) estimates of the optical constituents while simultaneously finding the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the model parameters. This approach resulted in faster computations of the optical constituents compared to Bayesian estimations, with equivalent RMSE values between the retrieved data and in-situ observations. We showed that both, the MCMC and SGVB based algorithms, were able to find sets of optimal parameters, which, due to correlations between them, are not unique. We conclude that both methods are consistent with the Radiative Transfer Equation. The first method provides reliable uncertainty estimations, while the second offers a faster alternative to standard inversion techniques, making it suitable for inversion and model optimization problems where MCMC algorithms are intractable."

In this two-stage epidemiological investigation, we unveiled for the first time the perturbations of exosomal miRNAs among individuals exposed to Cr(VI), alongside their significant correlations with biomarkers of genetic injury (γ-H2AX positivity in circulating lymphocytes and the urinary 8-OHdG levels) and immunological indicators (immunosuppressive PD-1 expression), which was supported by validation in an external cohort. Employing a support vector machine model, we discerned that exosomal miRNAs, particularly miR-4467, miR-345-5p, miR-144-3p, and miR-206, exhibited a remarkable capacity to delineate the genetic damage stratum within the population with high precision, and the target genes predicted of these miRNAs further elucidated their intricate regulatory interplay with the effector biomarkers. Additionally, employing a Bayesian mediation framework, we observed the intermediary function of miR-4467 in the nexus between chromium exposure and the escalation of urinary 8-OHdG levels (mediation effect: 0.47, P < 0.05). Although our findings suggested a link between extracellular miRNAs and immunosuppressive biomarkers, this association did not achieve validation in the external cohort, possibly due to population heterogeneity. Collectively, this study advanced our understanding of the epigenetic orchestration of health hazards of Cr(VI) by exosomal miRNAs, shedding light on their expression signatures and their intricate interplay with Cr(VI)-induced genetic and immunological perturbations, thus providing novel perspectives on the toxic pathways of heavy metals."

The toxicity of TWPs to organisms has raised significant concerns, yet their effects on terrestrial plants remain unclear. Here, we investigated the long-term impact of pristine and naturally aged TWPs on water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) and its rhizospheric soil. The results indicated that natural aging reduced the toxicity of TWPs, as evidenced by decreased levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil and TWPs themselves. Consequently, aged TWPs were found to enhance the plant growth and chlorophyll content, whereas pristine TWPs increased the plant stress. Furthermore, aged TWPs improved soil organic matter (SOM) and total organic carbon (TOC), thereby boosting the microbial enzymes involved in nitrogen cycling. Metabolomic analysis revealed that aged TWPs upregulated key pathways related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism, enhancing plant growth and stress responses. Additionally, rhizosphere bacterial diversity was higher under aged TWPs, favoring nutrient-cycling taxa such as Acidobacteriota and Nitrospirota. Pristine TWPs may lead to overproliferation of certain dominant species, thereby reducing microbial diversity in soil, which could ultimately compromise the soil health. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying TWP toxicity in plants and highlight the necessity for further research on the impact of aged TWPs across various plant species over different exposure durations for comprehensive risk assessment."

MPs frequently interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microbes, thereby influencing the carbon fate of soils. However, the role of plant presence in regulating MPs-mediated changes in the DOM and microbial structure remains unclear. Here, we compared the mechanisms of soil response to 3 common nonbiodegradable MPs in the absence or presence of radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. radculus Pers) plants. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) analysis revealed that MPs reduced the chemodiversity and biodiversity of dissolved organic matter (DOM). MPs enhanced the degradation of lignin-like compounds and reduced the DOM stability. Comparative analysis showed that MPs caused less disturbance to the microbial composition and metabolism in planted soil than in unplanted soil. In unplanted soil, MPs stimulated fermentation while upregulating photoautotrophic activity in planted soil, thereby enhancing system stability. The rhizosphere effect mitigated MPs-induced CO2 emissions. Overall, our study highlights the crucial role of rhizosphere effects in maintaining ecosystem stability under soil microbe-DOM-pollutant interactions, which provides a theoretical basis for predicting the resistance, resilience, and transitions of the ecosystem upon exposure to the anthropogenic carbon source."

The objective of this research was to evaluate the release of volatile PFAS to the gas-phase from PFAS-containing, single-use food packaging materials and from municipal solid waste (MSW) during anaerobic decomposition under simulated landfill conditions. After screening 46 materials for total F and 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), packaging materials were classified as high or low F. High F materials included microwavable popcorn bags, natural plates, compostable bowls, biodegradable boxes, bagasse containers and eco-friendly plates, while the low F materials tested were paper plates, eco-friendly food trays and poly coated freezer paper. Summed PFAS release from the high F materials was 62–800 ng PFAS/g sample and 6:2 FTOH comprised 96.8–99.9% of the summed PFAS.

The most important aspect of the PD process for engineering application is the stable and continuous supply of nitrite. However, the activity of nitrate reductase is often higher than that of nitrite reductase (NIR), making it difficult to accumulate nitrite during the denitrification process. Herein, a strategy for achieving efficient and stable partial denitrification using the biosafe additive dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was constructed, and the mechanism of DMSO inhibiting NIR was analyzed. DMSO addition reduced the expression of NIR gene, and 1% DMSO addition can significantly inhibit NIR enzyme activity to achieve a stable PD process. When the DMSO concentration increased to 3.5%, the NIR enzyme activity was almost inhibited with the enzyme activity of only 0.95 mg nitrite/min. However, the addition of DMSO has almost no inhibitory effect on the nitrate reductase (NAR) enzyme. The affinity constant of DMSO with the NAR enzyme is −2.4 kcal/mol, while the affinity constant of DMSO with the NIR enzyme is as high as −3.1 kcal/mol. DMSO shows a higher affinity for NIR. Moreover, DMSO and nitrite occupy the same catalytic cavity in the NIR enzyme, which is the fundamental reason why DMSO selectively inhibits the NIR enzyme.

Silva,A Nudge to the Truth: Atom Conservation as a Hard Constraint in Models of Atmospheric Composition Using a Species-Weighted Correction,"Computational models of atmospheric composition are not always physically consistent. For example, not all models respect fundamental conservation laws such as conservation of atoms in an interconnected chemical system. In well performing models, these unphysical deviations are often ignored because they are frequently minor, and thus only need a small nudge to perfectly conserve mass. Here we introduce a method that anchors a prediction from any numerical model to physically consistent hard constraints, nudging concentrations to the nearest solution that respects the conservation laws. This closed-form model-agnostic correction uses a single matrix operation to minimally perturb the predicted concentrations to ensure that atoms are conserved to machine precision. To demonstrate this approach, we train a gradient boosting decision tree ensemble to emulate a small reference model of ozone photochemistry and test the effect of the correction on accurate but nonconservative predictions. The nudging approach minimally perturbs the already well-predicted results for most species, but decreases the accuracy of important oxidants, including radicals. We develop a weighted extension of this nudging approach that considers the uncertainty and magnitude of each species in the correction. This species-level weighting approach is essential to accurately predict important low concentration species such as radicals. We find that applying the species-weighted correction slightly improves overall accuracy by nudging unphysical predictions to a more likely mass-conserving solution."

Among the elderly, depression is particularly prevalent and is often linked to social isolation. However, the specific role of EE in social isolation-related geriatric depression remains imprecise. This study was intended to explore the status of EE exposure in geriatric depression and to uncover its underlying mechanisms. We utilized 19-month-old male C57BL/6J mice, which are equivalent to humans aged 50–60 years, and induced depression through social isolation. After 2 weeks of social isolation, mice were identified as depressive by using the sugar preference test and then classified into either standard or enrichment environment groups for 4 weeks. Subsequently, conventional indices associated with depression, including neurogenesis, neurotrophic factors, and neuroinflammation, were measured. Results display that EE alleviated the depressive-like symptoms in elderly mice and enriched their social activities. Concurrently, EE regulated levels of certain neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, including the systems of glutamate, tyrosine, and histamine. Moreover, the ability of neurogenesis also increased in the hippocampus of EE mice. At the neuroinflammation level, the activation of Natural Killer (NK) cells and ARG1+ microglia is considered a major contributor to mediating the effects of EE-regulated geriatric depression. Collectively, these results underline the importance of EE in the treatment of geriatric depression and partially elucidate its underlying mechanism, offering valuable suggestions for treating social isolation--related depression via environmental modulation."

Here, we show that, contrary to expectations, LRM causes temperatures to increase in surrounding regions. The basic reason for the increase is unintended impacts on precipitation. Precipitation is suppressed over the LRM region, but this effect also extends to nearby areas unprotected by LRM. The reduction in precipitation and soil moisture in these regions leads to higher temperatures than would be expected in the absence of LRM.

However, lack of detailed observations and the simplifications inherent in operational ocean models, lead to incomplete knowledge of underlying ocean processes. Using high‐fidelity large‐eddy simulations and moored observations away from the storm track, we show that mutually interacting shear and convective processes, govern the evolving state of the upper ocean. Our simulation agrees well with observed sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity. Shear driven turbulence due to surface wind stress erodes stratification, deepens the ocean mixed layer and transports freshwater into the mixed layer during rain events. Concurrently, surface buoyancy loss also aids in ocean mixing via convective entrainment. The mixing efficiency and the associated eddy diffusivity shows high spatiotemporal variability throughout the water column during cyclone passage. Thus, a better insight into the upper ocean mixing mechanisms is necessary for developing improved mixing parameterizations for tropical cyclone intensity forecasts."

Previous studies have found land surface variation plausibly plays an important role in the occurrence and intensity of dust storms. However, the quantitative estimation and numerical description in current models are still limited. Here, a comprehensive study utilizing multiple observations and modeling methods to assess the influence of vegetation and snow on dust was conducted. We found that Gobi deserts exhibit substantial monthly and interannual variability in dust storms, which shows a close connection with vegetation and snow. To quantitatively understand the impact of vegetation and snow cover on dust emissions and also to better characterize such effects in numerical models, we introduced a high‐resolution dynamic dust source function that incorporates the effects of vegetation and snow on erodibility. The new parameterization noticeably improved dust‐related simulations, including aerosol optical thickness and PM10 concentrations, and provided insights into the distinct effects of vegetation and snow on dust emissions. This study sheds light on the effects of vegetation and snow on dust storms over the Gobi Desert, highlighting the importance of dynamic representation of time‐varying surface properties in dust simulation."

 Organic halides are highly useful compounds in chemical synthesis, where the halide serves as a versatile functional group for elimination, substitution, and cross-coupling reactions with transition metals or photocatalysis1-3. However, the activation of carbon-fluorine bonds, the most commercially abundant organohalide and found in PFAS, or “forever chemicals”, are much rarer. Current approaches based on photoredox chemistry for activation of small molecule carbon-fluorine (C–F) bonds are limited by the substrates and transition-metal catalysts needed4. A general method for the direct activation of organofluorines would have significant value in organic and environmental chemistry. Here, we report an organic photoredox catalyst system that can efficiently reduce C–F bonds to generate carbon-centered radicals, which can then be intercepted for hydrodefluorination (swapping F for H) and cross-coupling reactions. This system enables the general use of organofluorines as synthons under mild reaction conditions. We extend this method to the defluorination of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and fluorinated polymers, a critical challenge in the breakdown of persistent and environmentally damaging forever chemicals."

 Cross-electrophile coupling reactions have evolved into a major strategy for rapidly assembling important organic molecules1. Two readily accessible electrophiles are coupled to form new C–C bonds, providing a key advantage over traditional cross-coupling strategies that require the preformation of reactive organometallic species. Yet, the formation of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds that form the core of nearly all organic compounds remains highly challenging with current approaches, calling for the design of innovative new strategies. Here we report a distinct, transition-metal-free platform to form such bonds without the need for activating or stabilizing groups on the coupling partners. The reaction is enabled by an unusual single-electron transfer in a frustrated ion pair, and it can couple fragments containing functional groups that would be challenging in related transition-metal-catalysed processes. Moreover, we could further leverage this new mechanistic manifold in the design of other reactions, showing the broad potential of this type of reactivity. We anticipate that our results will provide a framework for further exploration of this reactivity pattern to tackle challenging problems in organic synthesis.

 Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found in many everyday consumer products, often because of their high thermal and chemical stabilities, as well as their hydrophobic and oleophobic properties1. However, the inert carbon–fluorine (C–F) bonds that give PFASs their properties also provide resistance to decomposition through defluorination, leading to long-term persistence in the environment, as well as in the human body, raising substantial safety and health concerns1–5. Despite recent advances in non-incineration approaches for the destruction of functionalized PFASs, processes for the recycling of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as well as polymeric PFASs such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are limited to methods that use either elevated temperatures or strong reducing reagents. Here we report the defluorination of PFASs with a highly twisted carbazole-cored super-photoreductant KQGZ. A series of PFASs could be defluorinated photocatalytically at 40–60 °C. PTFE gave amorphous carbon and fluoride salts as the major products. Oligomeric PFASs such as PFCs, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), polyfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and derivatives give carbonate, formate, oxalate and trifluoroacetate as the defluorinated products. This allows for the recycling of fluorine in PFASs as inorganic fluoride salt. The mechanistic investigation reveals the difference in reaction behaviour and product components for PTFE and oligomeric PFASs. This work opens a window for the low-temperature photoreductive defluorination of the ‘forever chemicals’ PFASs, especially for PTFE, as well as the discovery of new super-photoreductants.

 Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) is the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in humans. It is life-threatening and has a first peak of incidence in childhood, during primary infection. Children with HSE are not particularly prone to other infections, including HSV-1 infections of tissues other than the brain. About 8–10% of childhood cases are due to monogenic inborn errors of 19 genes, two-thirds of which are recessive, and most of which display incomplete clinical penetrance. Childhood HSE can therefore be sporadic but genetic, enabling new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this Review, we examine essential cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity in the brain that are disrupted in individuals with HSE. These mechanisms include both known (such as mutations in the TLR3 pathway) and previously unknown (such as the TMEFF1 restriction factor) antiviral pathways, which may be dependent (for example, IFNAR1) or independent (for example, through RIPK3) of type I interferons. They operate in cortical or brainstem neurons, and underlie forebrain and brainstem infections, respectively. Conversely, the most severe inborn errors of leukocytes, including a complete lack of myeloid and/or lymphoid blood cells, do not underlie HSE. Thus congenital defects in intrinsic immunity in brain-resident neurons that underlie HSE broaden natural host defences against HSV-1 from the leukocytes of the immune system to other cells in the organism.

 Malaria pathology is driven by the accumulation of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in microvessels1. This process is mediated by the polymorphic erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesion proteins of the parasite. A subset of PfEMP1 variants that bind to human endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) through their CIDRα1 domains is responsible for severe malaria pathogenesis2. A longstanding question is whether individual antibodies can recognize the large repertoire of circulating PfEMP1 variants. Here we describe two broadly reactive and inhibitory human monoclonal antibodies to CIDRα1. The antibodies isolated from two different individuals exhibited similar and consistent EPCR-binding inhibition of diverse CIDRα1 domains, representing five of the six subclasses of CIDRα1. Both antibodies inhibited EPCR binding of both recombinant full-length and native PfEMP1 proteins, as well as parasite sequestration in bioengineered 3D human brain microvessels under physiologically relevant flow conditions. Structural analyses of the two antibodies in complex with three different CIDRα1 antigen variants reveal similar binding mechanisms that depend on interactions with three highly conserved amino acid residues of the EPCR-binding site in CIDRα1. These broadly reactive antibodies are likely to represent a common mechanism of acquired immunity to severe malaria and offer novel insights for the design of a vaccine or treatment targeting severe malaria.

 T cells develop from circulating precursor cells, which enter the thymus and migrate through specialized subcompartments that support their maturation and selection1. In humans, this process starts in early fetal development and is highly active until thymic involution in adolescence. To map the microanatomical underpinnings of this process in pre- and early postnatal stages, we established a quantitative morphological framework for the thymus—the Cortico-Medullary Axis—and used it to perform a spatially resolved analysis. Here, by applying this framework to a curated multimodal single-cell atlas, spatial transcriptomics and high-resolution multiplex imaging data, we demonstrate establishment of the lobular cytokine network, canonical thymocyte trajectories and thymic epithelial cell distributions by the beginning of the the second trimester of fetal development. We pinpoint tissue niches of thymic epithelial cell progenitors and distinct subtypes associated with Hassall’s corpuscles and identify divergence in the timing of medullary entry between CD4 and CD8 T cell lineages. These findings provide a basis for a detailed understanding of T lymphocyte development and are complemented with a holistic toolkit for cross-platform imaging data analysis, annotation and OrganAxis construction (TissueTag), which can be applied to any tissue.

 Green indium phosphide (InP)-based quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) still suffer from low efficiency and short operational lifetime, posing a critical challenge to fully cadmium-free QD-LED displays and lighting1–3. Unfortunately, the factors that underlie these limitations remain unclear and, therefore, no clear device-engineering guidelines are available. Here, by using electrically excited transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that the low efficiency of state-of-the-art green cadmium-free QD-LEDs (which ubiquitously adopt the InP–ZnSeS–ZnS core–shell–shell structure) originates from the ZnSeS interlayer because it imposes a high injection barrier that limits the electron concentration and trap saturation. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that replacing the currently widely used ZnSeS interlayer with a thickened ZnSe interlayer enables improved electron injection and depressed leakage simultaneously, allowing to achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.68% and T95 lifetime (time for the luminance to drop to 95% of the initial value) of 1,241 h at an initial brightness of 1,000 cd m–2 in green InP-based QD-LEDs emitting at 543 nm—exceeding the previous best values by a factor of 1.6 and 165, respectively3,4.

 C4 photosynthesis is used by the most productive plants on the planet, and compared with the ancestral C3 pathway, it confers a 50% increase in efficiency1. In more than 60 C4 lineages, CO2 fixation is compartmentalized between tissues, and bundle-sheath cells become photosynthetically activated2. How the bundle sheath acquires this alternate identity that allows efficient photosynthesis is unclear.

From single-nucleus gene-expression and chromatin-accessibility atlases, we uncover DNA binding with one finger (DOF) motifs that define bundle-sheath identity in the major crops C3 rice and C4 sorghum. Photosynthesis genes that are rewired to be strongly expressed in the bundle-sheath cells of C4 sorghum acquire cis-elements that are recognized by DOFs. Our findings are consistent with a simple model in which C4 photosynthesis is based on the recruitment of an ancestral cis-code associated with bundle-sheath identity. Gain of such elements harnessed a stable patterning of transcription factors between cell types that are found in both C3 and C4 leaves to activate photosynthesis in the bundle sheath. Our findings provide molecular insights into the evolution of the complex C4 pathway, and might also guide the rational engineering of C4 photosynthesis in C3 crops to improve crop productivity and resilience3,4. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and chromatin-accessibility analyses in rice (a C3 plant) and sorghum (a C4 plant) provide insight into how C4 photosynthesis evolved in bundle-sheath cells, revealing that the acquisition of ancestral cis-elements was key."

 Since Hampé’s classic developmental experiments in the mid-twentieth century1,2, the reduced avian fibula has sparked sustained curiosity3–6. The fibula transformed throughout dinosaur evolution from a columnar structure into its splint-like avian form, a change long thought to be of little biomechanical consequence3,6. Here we integrated comparative three-dimensional kinematic analyses with transitional morphologies from the fossil record to refute this assumption and show that the reduced fibula serves a crucial function in enabling extreme knee long-axis rotation (LAR). Extreme LAR is fundamental to avian locomotion and is regularly exploited by living birds to execute complex terrestrial manoeuvres7. We infer that the evolution of this capacity was preceded by restriction of the knee to hinge-like motion in early theropod dinosaurs, driven by the origin of a mid-shank articulation8 that precluded ancestral patterns of tibiofibular motion. Freeing of the fibula from the ankle joint later enabled mobilization of this initially static articulation and, in doing so, established a novel pattern of tibiofibular kinematics essential to the extreme levels of LAR retained by modern birds. Fibular reduction thus ushered in a transition to LAR-dominated three-dimensional limb control, profoundly altering the course of theropod locomotor evolution. Using three-dimensional kinematic analyses, fibular reduction is shown to have a functional evolutionary adaptative role in birds to enable knee long-axis rotation."

 Aneuploid epithelial cells are common in breast cancer1,2; however, their presence in normal breast tissues is not well understood. To address this question, we applied single-cell DNA sequencing to profile copy number alterations in 83,206 epithelial cells from the breast tissues of 49 healthy women, and we applied single-cell DNA and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing co-assays to the samples of 19 women.

Many aneuploid epithelial cells (median 82.22%) in normal breast tissues underwent clonal expansions and harboured copy number alterations reminiscent of invasive breast cancers (gains of 1q; losses of 10q, 16q and 22q). Co-assay profiling showed that the aneuploid cells were mainly associated with the two luminal epithelial lineages, and spatial mapping showed that they localized in ductal and lobular structures with normal histopathology.

 The observed temperature record, which combines sea surface temperatures with near-surface air temperatures over land, is crucial for understanding climate variability and change1–4. However, early records of global mean surface temperature are uncertain owing to changes in measurement technology and practice, partial documentation5–8, and incomplete spatial coverage9. Here we show that existing estimates of ocean temperatures in the early twentieth century (1900–1930) are too cold, based on independent statistical reconstructions of the global mean surface temperature from either ocean or land data. The ocean-based reconstruction is on average about 0.26 °C colder than the land-based one, despite very high agreement in all other periods. The ocean cold anomaly is unforced, and internal variability in climate models cannot explain the observed land–ocean discrepancy. Several lines of evidence based on attribution, timescale analysis, coastal grid cells and palaeoclimate data support the argument of a substantial cold bias in the observed global sea-surface-temperature record in the early twentieth century. Although estimates of global warming since the mid-nineteenth century are not affected, correcting the ocean cold bias would result in a more modest early-twentieth-century warming trend10, a lower estimate of decadal-scale variability inferred from the instrumental record3, and better agreement between simulated and observed warming than existing datasets suggest2.

 The intestine is characterized by an environment in which host requirements for nutrient and water absorption are consequently paired with the requirements to establish tolerance to the outside environment. To better understand how the intestine functions in health and disease, large efforts have been made to characterize the identity and composition of cells from different intestinal regions1–8. However, the robustness, nature of adaptability and extent of resilience of the transcriptional landscape and cellular underpinning of the intestine in space are still poorly understood. Here we generated an integrated resource of the spatial and cellular landscape of the murine intestine in the steady and perturbed states. Leveraging these data, we demonstrated that the spatial landscape of the intestine was robust to the influence of the microbiota and was adaptable in a spatially restricted manner. Deploying a model of spatiotemporal acute inflammation, we demonstrated that both robust and adaptable features of the landscape were resilient. Moreover, highlighting the physiological relevance and value of our dataset, we identified a region of the middle colon characterized by an immune-driven multicellular spatial adaptation of structural cells to the microbiota. Our results demonstrate that intestinal regionalization is characterized by robust and resilient structural cell states and that the intestine can adapt to environmental stress in a spatially controlled manner through the crosstalk between immunity and structural cell homeostasis.

 The half-filled lowest Landau level is a fascinating platform for researching interacting topological phases. A celebrated example is the composite Fermi liquid, a non-Fermi liquid formed by composite fermions in strong magnetic fields1–10. Its zero-field counterpart is predicted in a twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2)11,12—a recently discovered fractional Chern insulator exhibiting the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect13–16. Although transport measurements at ν = −1/2 show signatures consistent with a zero-field composite Fermi liquid14, new probes are crucial to investigate the state and its elementary excitations. Here, by using the unique valley properties of tMoTe2, we report optical signatures of a zero-field composite Fermi liquid. We measured the degree of circular polarization (ρ) of trion photoluminescence versus hole doping and electric field. We found that, within the phase space showing robust ferromagnetism, ρ is near unity for Fermi liquid states. However, ρ is quenched at both integer and fractional Chern insulators, and in a hole doping range near ν = −1/2. Temperature, optical excitation power and electric-field-dependence measurements demonstrate that the quenching of ρ is a direct consequence of an energy gap (pseudogap) for electronic excitations of the Chern insulators (composite Fermi liquid): because the local spin-polarized excitations necessary to form trions are strongly suppressed, trion formation at the corresponding filling factors relies on optically generated unpolarized itinerant holes. Our work highlights a new excitonic probe of zero-field fractional Chern insulator physics, unique to tMoTe2.

 Uncontrolled regeneration leads to neoplastic transformation1–3. The intestinal epithelium requires precise regulation during continuous homeostatic and damage-induced tissue renewal to prevent neoplastic transformation, suggesting that pathways unlinking tumour growth from regenerative processes must exist. Here, by mining RNA-sequencing datasets from two intestinal damage models4,5 and using pharmacological, transcriptomics and genetic tools, we identified liver X receptor (LXR) pathway activation as a tissue adaptation to damage that reciprocally regulates intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, intestinal organoids, and gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that LXR activation in intestinal epithelial cells induces amphiregulin (Areg), enhancing regenerative responses. This response is coordinated by the LXR-ligand-producing enzyme CYP27A1, which was upregulated in damaged intestinal crypt niches. Deletion of Cyp27a1 impaired intestinal regeneration, which was rescued by exogenous LXR agonists. Notably, in tumour models, Cyp27a1 deficiency led to increased tumour growth, whereas LXR activation elicited anti-tumour responses dependent on adaptive immunity. Consistently, human colorectal cancer specimens exhibited reduced levels of CYP27A1, LXR target genes, and B and CD8 T cell gene signatures. We therefore identify an epithelial adaptation mechanism to damage, whereby LXR functions as a rheostat, promoting tissue repair while limiting tumorigenesis.

 Building a large-scale quantum computer requires effective strategies to correct errors that inevitably arise in physical quantum systems1. Quantum error-correction codes2 present a way to reach this goal by encoding logical information redundantly into many physical qubits. A key challenge in implementing such codes is accurately decoding noisy syndrome information extracted from redundancy checks to obtain the correct encoded logical information. Here we develop a recurrent, transformer-based neural network that learns to decode the surface code, the leading quantum error-correction code3. Our decoder outperforms other state-of-the-art decoders on real-world data from Google’s Sycamore quantum processor for distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes4. On distances up to 11, the decoder maintains its advantage on simulated data with realistic noise including cross-talk and leakage, utilizing soft readouts and leakage information. After training on approximate synthetic data, the decoder adapts to the more complex, but unknown, underlying error distribution by training on a limited budget of experimental samples. Our work illustrates the ability of machine learning to go beyond human-designed algorithms by learning from data directly, highlighting machine learning as a strong contender for decoding in quantum computers.

 The binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to genomic enhancers drives gene expression in mammalian cells1. However, the molecular details that link enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state and transcription levels remain unclear. Here we applied single-molecule footprinting2,3 to measure the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes and other regulatory proteins on engineered enhancer–promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic TF and an endogenous TF involved in the type I interferon response. Although TF binding events on nucleosome-free DNA are independent, activation domains recruit cofactors that destabilize nucleosomes, driving observed TF binding cooperativity. Average TF occupancy linearly determines promoter activity, and we decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the enhancer binding microstates and gene expression dynamics. This work provides a template for the quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene expression, including TF activation domains, concentration, binding affinity, binding site configuration and recruitment of chromatin regulators.

 Needle-based injections currently enable the administration of a wide range of biomacromolecule therapies across the body, including the gastrointestinal tract1–3, through recent developments in ingestible robotic devices4–7. However, needles generally require training, sharps management and disposal, and pose challenges for autonomous ingestible systems. Here, inspired by the jetting systems of cephalopods, we have developed and evaluated microjet delivery systems that can deliver jets in axial and radial directions into tissue, making them suitable for tubular and globular segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, they are implemented in both tethered and ingestible formats, facilitating endoscopic applications or patient self-dosing. Our study identified suitable pressure and nozzle dimensions for different segments of the gastrointestinal tract and applied microjets in a variety of devices that support delivery across the various anatomic segments of the gastrointestinal tract. We characterized the ability of these systems to administer macromolecules, including insulin, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) analogue and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) in large animal models, achieving exposure levels similar to those achieved with subcutaneous delivery.

 The role of the vertebrate retina in early vision is generally described by the efficient coding hypothesis1,2, which predicts that the retina reduces the redundancy inherent in natural scenes3 by discarding spatiotemporal correlations while preserving stimulus information4. It is unclear, however, whether the predicted decorrelation and redundancy reduction in the activity of ganglion cells, the retina’s output neurons, hold under gaze shifts, which dominate the dynamics of the natural visual input5. We show here that species-specific gaze patterns in natural stimuli can drive correlated spiking responses both in and across distinct types of ganglion cells in marmoset as well as mouse retina. These concerted responses disrupt redundancy reduction to signal fixation periods with locally high spatial contrast. Model-based analyses of ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli show that the observed response correlations follow from nonlinear pooling of ganglion cell inputs. Our results indicate cell-type-specific deviations from efficient coding in retinal processing of natural gaze shifts.

 Predicting elemental cycles and maintaining water quality under increasing anthropogenic influence requires knowledge of the spatial drivers of river microbiomes. However, understanding of the core microbial processes governing river biogeochemistry is hindered by a lack of genome-resolved functional insights and sampling across multiple rivers. Here we used a community science effort to accelerate the sampling, sequencing and genome-resolved analyses of river microbiomes to create the Genome Resolved Open Watersheds database (GROWdb). GROWdb profiles the identity, distribution, function and expression of microbial genomes across river surface waters covering 90% of United States watersheds. Specifically, GROWdb encompasses microbial lineages from 27 phyla, including novel members from 10 families and 128 genera, and defines the core river microbiome at the genome level. GROWdb analyses coupled to extensive geospatial information reveals local and regional drivers of microbial community structuring, while also presenting foundational hypotheses about ecosystem function. Building on the previously conceived River Continuum Concept1, we layer on microbial functional trait expression, which suggests that the structure and function of river microbiomes is predictable.

 Although rare neurodevelopmental conditions have a large Mendelian component1, common genetic variants also contribute to risk2,3. However, little is known about how this polygenic risk is distributed among patients with these conditions and their parents nor its interplay with rare variants. It is also unclear whether polygenic background affects risk directly through alleles transmitted from parents to children, or whether indirect genetic effects mediated through the family environment4 also play a role. Here we addressed these questions using genetic data from 11,573 patients with rare neurodevelopmental conditions, 9,128 of their parents and 26,869 controls. Common variants explained around 10% of variance in risk. Patients with a monogenic diagnosis had significantly less polygenic risk than those without, supporting a liability threshold model5. A polygenic score for neurodevelopmental conditions showed only a direct genetic effect. By contrast, polygenic scores for educational attainment and cognitive performance showed no direct genetic effect, but the non-transmitted alleles in the parents were correlated with the child’s risk, potentially due to indirect genetic effects and/or parental assortment for these traits4. Indeed, as expected under parental assortment, we show that common variant predisposition for neurodevelopmental conditions is correlated with the rare variant component of risk. These findings indicate that future studies should investigate the possible role and nature of indirect genetic effects on rare neurodevelopmental conditions, and consider the contribution of common and rare variants simultaneously when studying cognition-related phenotypes. Patients with neurodevelopmental conditions without a monogenic diagnosis have a higher polygenic burden than those with a monogenic diagnosis. Non-transmitted common alleles in the parents are associated with the child’s phenotype, and the common and rare variants conferring risk are correlated."

 Human embryonic bone and joint formation is determined by coordinated differentiation of progenitors in the nascent skeleton. The cell states, epigenetic processes and key regulatory factors that underlie lineage commitment of these cells remain elusive. Here we applied paired transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of approximately 336,000 nucleus droplets and spatial transcriptomics to establish a multi-omic atlas of human embryonic joint and cranium development between 5 and 11 weeks after conception. Using combined modelling of transcriptional and epigenetic data, we characterized regionally distinct limb and cranial osteoprogenitor trajectories across the embryonic skeleton and further described regulatory networks that govern intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Spatial localization of cell clusters in our in situ sequencing data using a new tool, ISS-Patcher, revealed mechanisms of progenitor zonation during bone and joint formation. Through trajectory analysis, we predicted potential non-canonical cellular origins for human chondrocytes from Schwann cells. We also introduce SNP2Cell, a tool to link cell-type-specific regulatory networks to polygenic traits such as osteoarthritis. Using osteolineage trajectories characterized here, we simulated in silico perturbations of genes that cause monogenic craniosynostosis and implicate potential cell states and disease mechanisms. This work forms a detailed and dynamic regulatory atlas of bone and cartilage maturation and advances our fundamental understanding of cell-fate determination in human skeletal development.

 Human neural organoids, generated from pluripotent stem cells in vitro, are useful tools to study human brain development, evolution and disease. However, it is unclear which parts of the human brain are covered by existing protocols, and it has been difficult to quantitatively assess organoid variation and fidelity. Here we integrate 36 single-cell transcriptomic datasets spanning 26 protocols into one integrated human neural organoid cell atlas totalling more than 1.7 million cells1–26. Mapping to developing human brain references27–30 shows primary cell types and states that have been generated in vitro, and estimates transcriptomic similarity between primary and organoid counterparts across protocols. We provide a programmatic interface to browse the atlas and query new datasets, and showcase the power of the atlas to annotate organoid cell types and evaluate new organoid protocols. Finally, we show that the atlas can be used as a diverse control cohort to annotate and compare organoid models of neural disease, identifying genes and pathways that may underlie pathological mechanisms with the neural models. The human neural organoid cell atlas will be useful to assess organoid fidelity, characterize perturbed and diseased states and facilitate protocol development.

Parada,Gliocidin is a nicotinamide-mimetic prodrug that targets glioblastoma,"The prodrug gliocidin effectively kills glioblastoma cells by targeting de novo purine synthesis, improving survival in mouse models. 
 Glioblastoma is incurable and in urgent need of improved therapeutics1. Here we identify a small compound, gliocidin, that kills glioblastoma cells while sparing non-tumour replicative cells. Gliocidin activity targets a de novo purine synthesis vulnerability in glioblastoma through indirect inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2). IMPDH2 blockade reduces intracellular guanine nucleotide levels, causing nucleotide imbalance, replication stress and tumour cell death2. Gliocidin is a prodrug that is anabolized into its tumoricidal metabolite, gliocidin–adenine dinucleotide (GAD), by the enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1) of the NAD+ salvage pathway. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of GAD together with IMPDH2 demonstrates its entry, deformation and blockade of the NAD+ pocket3. In vivo, gliocidin penetrates the blood–brain barrier and extends the survival of mice with orthotopic glioblastoma. The DNA alkylating agent temozolomide induces Nmnat1 expression, causing synergistic tumour cell killing and additional survival benefit in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models. This study brings gliocidin to light as a prodrug with the potential to improve the survival of patients with glioblastoma.

 The fractional quantum Hall effect is a key example of topological quantum many-body phenomena, arising from the interplay between strong electron correlation, topological order and time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, a lattice analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field has been observed, confirming the existence of a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI). Despite this, the bulk–edge correspondence—a hallmark of a FCI featuring an insulating bulk with conductive edges—has not been directly observed. In fact, this correspondence has not been visualized in any system for fractional states owing to experimental challenges. Here we report the imaging of FCI edge states in twisted MoTe2 (t-MoTe2) using microwave impedance microscopy1. By tuning the carrier density, we observe the system evolving between metallic and FCI states, the latter of which exhibits insulating bulk and conductive edges, as expected from the bulk–boundary correspondence. Further analysis suggests the composite nature of the FCI edge states. We also observe the evolution of edge states across the topological phase transition as a function of interlayer electric field and reveal exciting prospects of neighbouring domains with different fractional orders. These findings pave the way for research into topologically protected one-dimensional interfaces between various anyonic states at zero magnetic field, such as gapped one-dimensional symmetry-protected phases with non-zero topological entanglement entropy, Halperin–Laughlin interfaces and the creation of non-abelian anyons. The bulk–edge correspondence is directly imaged in a fractional Chern insulator at zero magnetic field with exciton-resonant microwave impedance microscopy, revealing spatially resolved bulk and edge characteristics, and the evolution of topological states in twisted MoTe2."

 As an essential branched amino acid, valine is pivotal for protein synthesis, neurological behaviour, haematopoiesis and leukaemia progression1–3. However, the mechanism by which cellular valine abundancy is sensed for subsequent cellular functions remains undefined. Here we identify that human histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) serves as a valine sensor by directly binding valine through a primate-specific SE14 repeat domain. The nucleus and cytoplasm shuttling of human, but not mouse, HDAC6 is tightly controlled by the intracellular levels of valine. Valine deprivation leads to HDAC6 retention in the nucleus and induces DNA damage. Mechanistically, nuclear-localized HDAC6 binds and deacetylates ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) to initiate active DNA demethylation, which promotes DNA damage through thymine DNA glycosylase-driven excision. Dietary valine restriction inhibits tumour growth in xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models, and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PARP inhibitors. Collectively, our study identifies human HDAC6 as a valine sensor that mediates active DNA demethylation and DNA damage in response to valine deprivation, and highlights the potential of dietary valine restriction for cancer treatment.

 The gastrointestinal tract is a multi-organ system crucial for efficient nutrient uptake and barrier immunity. Advances in genomics and a surge in gastrointestinal diseases1,2 has fuelled efforts to catalogue cells constituting gastrointestinal tissues in health and disease3. Here we present systematic integration of 25 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets spanning the entire healthy gastrointestinal tract in development and in adulthood. We uniformly processed 385 samples from 189 healthy controls using a newly developed automated quality control approach (scAutoQC), leading to a healthy reference atlas with approximately 1.1 million cells and 136 fine-grained cell states. We anchor 12 gastrointestinal disease datasets spanning gastrointestinal cancers, coeliac disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease to this reference. Utilizing this 1.6 million cell resource (gutcellatlas.org), we discover epithelial cell metaplasia originating from stem cells in intestinal inflammatory diseases with transcriptional similarity to cells found in pyloric and Brunner’s glands. Although previously linked to mucosal healing4, we now implicate pyloric gland metaplastic cells in inflammation through recruitment of immune cells including T cells and neutrophils. Overall, we describe inflammation-induced changes in stem cells that alter mucosal tissue architecture and promote further inflammation, a concept applicable to other tissues and diseases.

 When humans assemble into face-to-face social networks, they create an extended social environment that permits exposure to the microbiome of others, thereby shaping the composition and diversity of the microbiome at individual and population levels1–6. Here we use comprehensive social network mapping and detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,787 adults within 18 isolated villages in Honduras7 to investigate the relationship between network structure and gut microbiome composition. Using both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections. Furthermore, strain-sharing extends to second-degree social connections, suggesting the relevance of a person’s broader network. We also observe that socially central people are more microbially similar to the overall village than socially peripheral people. Among 301 people whose microbiome was re-measured 2 years later, we observe greater convergence in strain-sharing in connected versus otherwise similar unconnected co-villagers. Clusters of species and strains occur within clusters of people in village social networks, meaning that social networks provide the social niches within which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are manifested.

 Astronomers have found more than a dozen planets transiting stars that are 10–40 million years old1, but younger transiting planets have remained elusive. The lack of such discoveries may be because planets have not fully formed at this age or because our view is blocked by the protoplanetary disk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped or broken2; provided the inner disk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report observations of the transiting planet IRAS 04125+2902 b orbiting a 3-million-year-old, 0.7-solar-mass, pre-main-sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The host star harbours a nearly face-on (30 degrees inclination) transitional disk3 and a wide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.7 Earth radii (0.96 Jupiter radii) and a 95%-confidence upper limit on its mass of 90 Earth masses (0.3 Jupiter masses) from radial-velocity measurements, making it a possible precursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes frequently found around main-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the wide (4 arcseconds, 635 astronomical units) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations. Thus, all components of the system are consistent with alignment except the outer disk; the origin of this misalignment is unclear.

 Animals are often bombarded with visual information and must prioritize specific visual features based on their current needs. The neuronal circuits that detect and relay visual features have been well studied1–8. Much less is known about how an animal adjusts its visual attention as its goals or environmental conditions change. During social behaviours, flies need to focus on nearby flies9–11. Here we study how the flow of visual information is altered when female Drosophila enter an aggressive state. From the connectome, we identify three state-dependent circuit motifs poised to modify the response of an aggressive female to fly-sized visual objects: convergence of excitatory inputs from neurons conveying select visual features and internal state; dendritic disinhibition of select visual feature detectors; and a switch that toggles between two visual feature detectors. Using cell-type-specific genetic tools, together with behavioural and neurophysiological analyses, we show that each of these circuit motifs is used during female aggression. We reveal that features of this same switch operate in male Drosophila during courtship pursuit, suggesting that disparate social behaviours may share circuit mechanisms. Our study provides a compelling example of using the connectome to infer circuit mechanisms that underlie dynamic processing of sensory signals.

 Autologous bone (AB) is the gold standard for bone-replacement surgeries1, despite its limited availability and the need for an extra surgical site. Traditionally, competitive biomaterials for bone repair have focused on mimicking the mineral aspect of bone, as evidenced by the widespread clinical use of bioactive ceramics2. However, AB also exhibits hierarchical organic structures that might substantially affect bone regeneration. Here, using a range of cell-free biomimetic-collagen-based materials in murine and ovine bone-defect models, we demonstrate that a hierarchical hybrid microstructure—specifically, the twisted plywood pattern of collagen and its association with poorly crystallized bioapatite—favourably influences bone regeneration.

 Quantum computers process information with the laws of quantum mechanics. Current quantum hardware is noisy, can only store information for a short time and is limited to a few quantum bits, that is, qubits, typically arranged in a planar connectivity1. However, many applications of quantum computing require more connectivity than the planar lattice offered by the hardware on more qubits than is available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU). The community hopes to tackle these limitations by connecting QPUs using classical communication, which has not yet been proven experimentally. Here we experimentally realize error-mitigated dynamic circuits and circuit cutting to create quantum states requiring periodic connectivity using up to 142 qubits spanning two QPUs with 127 qubits each connected in real time with a classical link. In a dynamic circuit, quantum gates can be classically controlled by the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements within run-time, that is, within a fraction of the coherence time of the qubits. Our real-time classical link enables us to apply a quantum gate on one QPU conditioned on the outcome of a measurement on another QPU. Furthermore, the error-mitigated control flow enhances qubit connectivity and the instruction set of the hardware thus increasing the versatility of our quantum computers. Our work demonstrates that we can use several quantum processors as one with error-mitigated dynamic circuits enabled by a real-time classical link. A 142-qubit processor can be realized by connecting two smaller quantum processors using classical communications and circuit cutting."

Here the authors show autophagy is crucial for full male fertility in Arabidopsis and that impaired autophagy disrupts sperm cell biogenesis and pollen tube growth. 
 Autophagy, a crucial mechanism for cellular degradation, is regulated by conserved autophagy-related (ATG) core proteins across species. Impairments in autophagy result in significant developmental and reproductive aberrations in mammals. However, autophagy is thought to be functionally dispensable in Arabidopsis thaliana since most of the ATG mutants lack severe growth and reproductive defects. Here, we challenge this perception by unveiling a role for autophagy in male gametophyte development and fertility in Arabidopsis. A detailed re-assessment of atg5 and atg7 mutants found that reduced autophagy activity in germinated pollen accompanied by partial aberrations in sperm cell biogenesis and pollen tube growth, leading to compromised seed formation. Furthermore, we revealed autophagy modulates the spatial organization of actin filaments via targeted degradation of actin depolymerization factors ADF7 and Profilin2 in pollen grains and tubes through a key receptor, Neighbor of BRCA1 (NBR1). Our findings advance the understanding of the evolutionary conservation and diversification of autophagy in modulating male fertility in plants contrasting to mammals.

Here, the authors show that the C. elegans PIEZO channel regulates swallowing by detecting intestinal food buildup and triggering pharyngeal movements to aid ingestion. 
 Sensations of the internal state of the body play crucial roles in regulating the physiological processes and maintaining homeostasis of an organism. However, our understanding of how internal signals are sensed, processed, and integrated to generate appropriate biological responses remains limited. Here, we show that the C. elegans PIEZO channel, encoded by pezo-1, regulates food movement in the intestine by detecting food accumulation in the anterior part of the intestinal lumen, thereby triggering rhythmical movement of the pharynx, referred to as the pharyngeal plunge. pezo-1 deletion mutants exhibit defects in the pharyngeal plunge, which is rescued by PEZO-1 or mouse PIEZO1 expression, but not by PIEZO2, in a single isolated non-neuronal tissue of the digestive tract, the pharyngeal-intestinal valve. Genetic ablation or optogenetic activation of this valve inhibits or induces the pharyngeal plunge, respectively. Moreover, pressure built in the anterior lumen of the intestine results in a pezo-1-dependent pharyngeal plunge, which is driven by head muscle contraction. These findings illustrate how interoceptive processes in a digestive organ regulate swallowing through the PIEZO channel, providing insights into how interoception coordinates ingestive processes in higher animals, including humans.

 APC/C is a multi-subunit complex that functions as a master regulator of cell division. It controls progression through the cell cycle by timely marking mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle regulatory proteins for degradation. The APC/C itself is regulated by the sequential action of its coactivator subunits CDC20 and CDH1, post-translational modifications, and its inhibitory binding partners EMI1 and the mitotic checkpoint complex. In this study, we took advantage of developments in cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structures of human APC/CCDH1:EMI1 and apo-APC/C at 2.9 Å and 3.2 Å resolution, respectively, providing insights into the regulation of APC/C activity. The high-resolution maps allow the unambiguous assignment of an α-helix to the N-terminus of CDH1 (CDH1α1) in the APC/CCDH1:EMI1 ternary complex. We also identify a zinc-binding module in APC2 that confers structural stability to the complex, and we confirm the presence of zinc ions experimentally. Finally, due to the higher resolution and well defined density of these maps, we are able to build, aided by AlphaFold predictions, several intrinsically disordered regions in different APC/C subunits that likely play a role in proper APC/C assembly and regulation of its activity.

 We present super-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy by implementing phase-resolved image scanning microscopy, achieving up to two-fold resolution increase as compared with a conventional CARS microscope.

 Understanding precise structures of two-/three- dimensional (2D/3D) covalent organic polymers (COPs) through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis is important. However, how to grow high-quality single crystals for 2D/3D COPs is of challenge due to poor reversibility and difficult self-correction of covalent bonds. In addition, the success of introducing tellurium into the backbone to construct 2D/3D COPs and obtaining their single crystals is rare. Here, utilizing the strategy that a heavy element (e.g., tellurium) can form dynamic linkages with a self-correction function, we develop a fast and universal method for growing large-sized single crystals (up to 500 µm) for 2D/3D COPs, especially for 2D COPs. Three 2D COPs and one 3D COP are harvested through dynamic -Te-O-P- bonds in two days, with structures clearly uncovered via the SCXRD analysis.

 Current understanding of soil carbon dynamics suggests that plant litter quality and soil mineralogy control the formation of mineral-associated soil organic carbon (SOC). Due to more efficient microbial anabolism, high-quality litter may produce more microbial residues for stabilisation on mineral surfaces. To test these fundamental concepts, we manipulate soil mineralogy using pristine minerals, characterise microbial communities and use stable isotopes to measure decomposition of low- and high-quality litter and mineral stabilisation of litter-C. We find that high-quality litter leads to less (not more) efficient formation of mineral-associated SOC due to soil microbial community shifts which lower carbon use efficiency. Low-quality litter enhances loss of pre-existing SOC resulting in no effect of litter quality on total mineral-associated SOC. However, mineral-associated SOC formation is primarily controlled by soil mineralogy. These findings refute the hypothesis that high-quality plant litters form mineral-associated SOC most efficiently and advance our understanding of how mineralogy and litter-microbial interactions regulate SOC formation.

 The change of groundwater storage (GWS) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is vital for water resources management and regional sustainability, but its estimation has large uncertainty due to insufficient hydrological measurements and diverse future climate scenarios. Here, we employ high-resolution land surface modeling, advanced satellite observations, global climate model data, and deep learning to estimate GWS changes in the past and future. We find a 3.51 ± 2.40 Gt yr−1 increase in GWS from 2002–2018, especially in exorheic basins, attributed to glacier melting. The GWS will persistently increase in the future, but the growth rate is slowing down (0.14 Gt yr−1 for 2079–2100 under a high emission scenario). Increasing GWS is projected over most endorheic basins, which is associated with increasing precipitation and decreasing shortwave radiation. In contrast, decreasing GWS is projected over the headwaters of Amu Darya, Yangtze, and Yellow river basins.

 India, heavily reliant on coal for power generation, has been a significant emitter of particulate matter (PM) bound lead (Pb) and other heavy metals. It is crucial to understand whether implementation of stricter norms in recent years have effectively reduced emissions from coal combustion. This study aims to investigate and quantify the primary sources of PM2.5 in an area housing a major lignite-fired power plant in South India using Pb isotopic compositions and elemental concentrations. Characteristic ratios such as V/Pb and Cu/Pb demonstrate negligible influence from coal combustion, and indicate that summer aerosols are influenced by open burning. In Pb triple-isotope space the PM2.5 aerosols plot away from coal, overlapping with open burning signatures. These indicate that the atmosphere is predominantly influenced by open burning of solid waste and biomass rather than coal combustion, suggesting a promising decrease in coal emissions. Bayesian mixing model demonstrates that solid waste & biomass burning is the largest anthropogenic contributor towards atmospheric Pb (up to 26%), even in a region of coal combustion and presence of medium and small-scale industries. The dominance of open burning as a pollution source in the vicinity of a lignite fired power plant highlights the necessity for better waste management strategies."

 Climate models exhibit errors in their simulation of historical trends of variables including sea surface temperature, winds, and precipitation, with important implications for regional and global climate projections. Here, we show that the same trend errors are also present in a suite of initialised seasonal re-forecasts for the years 1993–2016. These re-forecasts are produced by operational models that are similar to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)-class models and share their historical external forcings (e.g. CO2/aerosols). The trend errors, which are often well-developed at very short lead times, represent a roughly linear change in the model mean biases over the 1993–2016 re-forecast record. The similarity of trend errors in both the re-forecasts and historical simulations suggests that climate model trend errors likewise result from evolving mean biases, responding to changing external radiative forcings, instead of being an erroneous long-term response to external forcing. Therefore, these trend errors may be investigated by examining their short-lead development in initialised seasonal forecasts/re-forecasts, which we suggest should also be made by all CMIP models."

 Precipitation nowcasting, which is critical for flood emergency and river management, has remained challenging for decades, although recent developments in deep generative modeling (DGM) suggest the possibility of improvements. River management centers, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, have been using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models for nowcasting, but they have been struggling with missed detections even from best-in-class NWP models. While decades of prior research achieved limited improvements beyond advection and localized evolution, recent attempts have shown progress from so-called physics-free machine learning (ML) methods, and even greater improvements from physics-embedded ML approaches. Developers of DGM for nowcasting have compared their approaches with optical flow (a variant of advection) and meteorologists’ judgment, but not with NWP models. Further, they have not conducted independent co-evaluations with water resources and river managers. Here we show that the state-of-the-art physics-embedded deep generative model, specifically NowcastNet, outperforms the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, which is the latest generation of NWP, along with advection and persistence, especially for heavy precipitation events. Thus, for grid-cell extremes over 16 mm/h, NowcastNet demonstrated a median critical success index (CSI) of 0.30, compared with median CSI of 0.04 for HRRR. However, despite hydrologically-relevant improvements in point-by-point forecasts from NowcastNet, caveats include overestimation of spatially aggregate precipitation over longer lead times.

 Heat pumps play a major role in decreasing fossil fuel use in heating. They increase electricity demand, but could also foster the system integration of variable renewable energy sources. We analyze three scenarios for expanding decentralized heat pumps in Germany by 2030, focusing on the role of buffer heat storage. Using an open-source power sector model, we assess costs, capacity investments, and emissions effects.

Results further show that short-duration heat storage substantially reduces the need for firm capacity and battery storage. Larger heat storage sizes do not substantially change the results. Increasing the number of heat pumps from 1.7 to 10 million units could annually save more than half of Germany’s private and commercial natural gas consumption and around half of households’ building-related CO2 emissions.

 Numerous countries have adopted large-scale tree planting programs as a climate mitigation strategy and to improve local livelihoods. However, it remains poorly documented how the surge in tree plantations has altered local livelihoods. Here, we assess whether tropical tree plantation expansion and forest regrowth across 18 African countries are associated with local people’s living standards. By combining a recent map that distinguishes tree plantations from regrowth from 2000 to 2012 with multidimensional poverty measures from more than 200,000 households, we find a positive association between people's living standards and areas where tree plantations have expanded or, to a lesser extent, forest regrowth has occurred. Because tree plantations make up a large proportion of recent increases in tropical tree cover – and controversy remains about their potential impacts on both biodiversity and local people – our study provides broad empirical support for the idea that tree plantations and forest regrowth can be linked with reduced poverty in the short term.

 The formation of water ice clouds or hazes on Mars imposes substantial limitations on the vertical transport of water into the middle-upper atmosphere, impacting the planet’s hydrogen loss. Recent observations made by the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer instrument onboard Mars 2020 Perseverance rover have shown a marked decline in water ice abundance within the mesosphere (above 35-40 km) when Mars is near its aphelion (near the northern summer solstice), notably occurring during solar longitudes (Ls) between Ls 70∘ and 80∘. Orbital observations around the same latitudes indicate that temperatures between  ~ 30-40 km reach a minimum during the same period. Using cloud microphysics simulations, we demonstrate that this decrease in temperature effectively increases the amount of water cold-trapped at those altitudes, confining water ice condensation to lower altitudes. Similarly, the reinforcement of the cold trap induced by the lower temperatures results in significant reductions in the water vapor mixing ratio above 35–40 km, explaining the confinement of water vapor observed around aphelion from orbiters.

 The Neoproterozoic oxygenation event is a milestone in Earth’s history, yet the redox structure and elemental cycling of the Neoproterozoic ocean remain debated. Here, we investigated iron speciation, molybdenum, and nitrogen isotopes in black shales and manganese carbonates from the upper Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation, South China, to examine the links between redox state, manganese mineralization, and molybdenum cycling. In both lithologies, high pyritic iron ratios (> 0.8) indicate a localized euxinic zone, while estimated seawater molybdenum (1.9‰) and sediment nitrogen isotopic compositions (4.19 ± 1.96‰) resemble modern values, suggesting oxygenated surface waters over euxinic depths. Negative molybdenum isotope in manganese(II) carbonates points to manganese(IV) oxide reduction, acting as a molybdenum shuttle from oxygenated surface to euxinic deep waters. Periodic euxinic contractions drove manganese(II) oxidation and mineralization, shaping molybdenum cycling. This study highlights essential manganese(II) oxidation for manganese carbonate mineralization and offers new insights into molybdenum geochemistry and ancient ocean oxygenation events.

 Since the start of the satellite record in 1978, the three lowest summertime minima in Antarctic sea ice area all occurred within the last seven years and culminated in record low sea ice in austral winter 2023.

 The 2015–2016 El Niño-induced drought caused biomass loss in global tropical forests, yet the recovery duration of different vegetation components (woody components, upper canopies, and leaves) remains unknown. Here, we use satellite remote sensing data of vegetation optical depth and leaf area index, with varying sensitivity to different vegetation components, to examine vegetation recovery during the drought event. We find that the woody component had the slowest recovery compared to the upper canopy and leaves, and displayed greater spatial variability between continents. Key factors influencing woody recovery include drought severity, moisture-related climatic conditions (i.e., vapor pressure deficit, precipitation, and soil moisture), and seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation. Our study highlights the importance of different vegetation components for maintaining ecosystem balance under drought disturbances and indicates the need for further research to explore recovery mechanisms and the long-term impacts of drought on forest dynamics.

 Drivers of forest wildfire severity include fuels, topography and weather. However, because only fuels can be actively managed, quantifying their effects on severity has become an urgent research priority. Here we employed GEDI spaceborne lidar to consistently assess how pre-fire forest fuel structure affected wildfire severity across 42 California wildfires between 2019–2021. Using a spatial-hierarchical modeling framework, we found a positive concave-down relationship between GEDI-derived fuel structure and wildfire severity, marked by increasing severity with greater fuel loads until a decline in severity in the tallest and most voluminous forest canopies. Critically, indicators of canopy fuel volumes (like biomass and height) became decoupled from severity patterns in extreme topographic and weather conditions (slopes >20°; winds > 9.3 m/s). On the other hand, vertical continuity metrics like layering and ladder fuels more consistently predicted severity in extreme conditions – especially ladder fuels, where sparse understories were uniformly associated with lower severity levels. These results confirm that GEDI-derived fuel estimates can overcome limitations of optical imagery and airborne lidar for quantifying the interactive drivers of wildfire severity. Furthermore, these findings have direct implications for designing treatment interventions that target ladder fuels versus entire canopies and for delineating wildfire risk across topographic and weather conditions.

 Equitable internet coverage has emerged as a key global priority, which is essential for promoting inclusive and sustainable development. The Indonesian government aims to provide universal internet access by 2024, particularly in remote regions. This study introduces a novel machine-learning-based approach to identify the priority areas for deploying Base Transceiver Station (BTS) towers, which are crucial for achieving the internet access targets of the government. A BTS Network Priority Index was developed by integrating the internet demand estimates with a BTS suitability index derived from key predictors: proximity to fiber optic stations, physical–environmental suitability, and infrastructure–economic readiness. The model identified areas with high internet demand and high BTS suitability as the most critical for immediate development, covering 20 km2. Additionally, future BTS development should target areas with high demand but medium suitability (900 km2) and medium demand but high suitability (280 km2). To validate the methodology, the Random Forest model was employed, which achieved an area under the curve value of 0.7315, indicating strong predictive performance. For the BTS Deployment Suitability parameter, the median was 0.65, with the lower and upper quartiles at 0.44 and 0.85, respectively, confirming that most proposed locations are highly suitable for development. This systematic approach provides data-driven insights for the equitable distribution of BTS towers to ensure efficient internet infrastructure expansion across Indonesia.

This study utilized machine learning and the Time Warping-based K-Means method to evaluate the effectiveness of firework bans, the impact of emission reductions on pollutants during the Chinese New Year holiday, and the influence of meteorological conditions on pollutant concentrations during this period. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in emissions, with PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations decreasing by up to 24.76% and 33.39%, respectively, while O3 concentrations increased by up to 45%.

It is worth noting that pollution during the 2018 Chinese New Year holiday was more severe than before the holiday because the meteorological conditions before the holiday were favorable for pollutant dispersion, while unfavorable meteorological conditions during the holiday masked the emission reductions that occurred due to the holiday period.

Conventional theories posit that cholinergic signaling is pathologically elevated in PD as a result of increased ACh release, which contributes to motor deficits. However, using approaches to measure receptor-mediated signaling, we found that, rather than the predicted enhancement, the strength of cholinergic transmission at muscarinic M4 receptor synapses on direct pathway medium spiny neurons was decreased in dopamine-depleted mice. This adaptation was due to a reduced postsynaptic M4 receptor function, resulting from down-regulated receptors and downstream signaling. Restoring M4 transmission unexpectedly led to a partial alleviation of motor deficits and LID dyskinetic behavior, revealing an unexpected prokinetic effect in addition to the canonical antikinetic role of M4 receptors. These findings indicate that decreased M4 function differentially contributes to parkinsonian and LID pathophysiology, representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention."

In the x-ray region, however, spatial control has been virtually static mainly due to stringent requirements for realizing high-performance optical elements. The lack of dynamic spatial control of x-ray beam has prevented researchers from realizing more sophisticated use of the wave field, which has rapidly advanced in the optical region in the past decades. In this study, we propose a practical scheme to dynamically control local x-ray reflectivity of a perfect silicon crystal by a femtosecond optical laser and demonstrate a programmable spatial x-ray modulator. Our modulator aims for spatial manipulation of the x-ray amplitude and is shown to produce arbitrary grayscale patterns with spatial frequencies up to 25 per millimeter.

Through genome-scale DNA sequencing of hybrids and each species in the genus, we identifyBCO2as the major gene responsible for the color polymorphism. TheBCO2gene tree and genome-wide allele frequency patterns suggest that carotenoid-pigmented collars initially arose in a third species and reached the hybrid zone through historical gene flow.

While global temperature and precipitation responses are relatively homogeneous, subcontinental responses—especially in the northern mid-latitudes—are heterogeneous. At high latitudes, sea ice responses to freshwater fluxes and associated ice-albedo feedbacks determine temperature changes. In tropical and extratropical regions, temperature dynamics are shaped by atmospheric circulation and oceanic heat transport. Precipitation shows seasonal and regional variability due to altered surface turbulent heat flux and the southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

Traditionally, the classical Drude model describes plasmonic excitation, wherein plasma frequency exhibits no spatial dispersion. Here, we show conclusive experimental evidence of the breakdown of plasmon resonance and a consequent metal-insulator transition in an ultrathin refractory plasmonic material, hafnium nitride (HfN). Epitaxial HfN thick films exhibit a low-loss and high-quality Drude-like plasmon resonance in the visible spectral range. However, as the film thickness is reduced to nanoscale dimensions, Coulomb interaction among electrons increases because of electron confinement, leading to the spatial dispersion of plasma frequency. With a further decrease in thickness, electrons lose their ability to shield the incident electric field, turning the medium into a dielectric. The observed metal-insulator transition might carry some signatures of Wigner crystallization and indicates that such transdimensional, between 2D and 3D, films can serve as a promising playground to study strongly correlated electron systems."
