Newly available 30 m albedo retrievals derived from imagery acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite, analyzed at 273 652 field plots monitored by the United States Forest Service, suggest that large areas of the US Inter-Mountain West’s forests have a net warming impact on the planet’s surface energy balance. For the conterminous US, the impacts of albedo offset approximately half of the recognized non-soil forest carbon storage benefit. The emerging capacity to resolve albedo evolution at the scale of a large number of inventory plots also provides unprecedented empirical evidence that albedo impacts vary strongly as a function of both tree age and species group. This research highlights a correctable source of uncertainty in operational monitoring of forest-climate interactions, and it may temper expectations for forest establishment as a means of mitigating global climate change."

In this study, we developed a 586 year regional tree-ring width chronology using standard dendrochronological techniques on Picea smithiana (Wall.) Boiss, samples collected from lower elevations in the Chara and Naltar valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. Correlation analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between tree growth and summer precipitation as well as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) (p < 0.01), while a negative correlation was observed with summer temperatures. We used a linear regression model to reconstruct the summer (June–August) PDSI for the period 1431–2016 CE based on the relationship between regional chronology and climate data. This model accounted for 37.6% of the actual PDSI variation observed during the calibration period from 1956 to 2016 CE. The reconstruction identifies key hydroclimatic events, notably an extended severe drought from 1601 to 1608 (−0.87 ± 0.31), and a prolonged drought interval 1537–1549 (−0.61 ± 0.18). An extreme wet period was recorded in 1522–1533 (0.91 ± 0.32), whereas repeated decadal drought events were observed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Spatial correlation analyses demonstrate the impact of large-scale climatic drivers, such as sea surface temperature anomalies in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and underscore the significance of monsoon variability in determining regional moisture patterns. Our reconstruction, derived from the multitaper spectrum and Morlet wavelet spectrum analysis, exhibited significant periodicities of 47.9, 27, 21.8, and 2–3 years. The three periodicities likely correspond to the Pacific decadal oscillation or the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, whereas 2–3 cycles is strongly linked to El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Our study illustrates the essential function of tree-ring records in evaluating drought risk and underscores the wider consequences of variations in the climate in the Hindu Kush–Karakoram–Himalaya for millions of downstream populations."

Although short-term interactions between fire and vegetation are well-documented, long-term dynamics remain underexplored. This study examines fire regimes, vegetation dynamics, and its biodiversity over the past 17 000 years in southwest Tanzania, using sedimentary charcoal and pollen. Major ecological transformations of vegetation and fire regimes were recorded, with vegetation changes consistently preceded shifts in fire regimes. Increased grass pollen correlated with more frequent or larger fires, while high tree cover in Miombo woodland reduced fire activity. Interestingly, pollen evenness was a precursor to major ecological transformations as peaks preceded changes in ecosystem states. Changes in precipitation and moisture seems the major top–down drivers of these changes in vegetation and fire. Fire regimes were indirectly controlled by water availability, and vegetation exhibited resilience to fire at centennial timescales before reaching ecosystem shifts at 12 400 and 1700 cal BP. Our results emphasize the critical role of tree and grass cover in shaping fire regimes and highlight the interplay between climate, vegetation structure, and fire in East African ecosystems."

While individual climate variables like temperature, precipitation, and radiation are well-studied drivers of NEE, their interactions in multivariate contexts remain poorly understood. This study leverages the O-Information framework to disentangle the synergistic and redundant contributions of temperature, precipitation, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), terrestrial water storage, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to NEE variability. Analysing global and regional dynamics, we reveal the nature of multivariate interactions governing NEE. Globally, pairs like VPD-PAR consistently exhibit synergy, underscoring their complementary roles in driving carbon exchange, while T-VPD and T-terrestrial water storage interactions are predominantly redundant. Regional analyses highlight distinct patterns of information sharing: temperate forests and semiarid regions are synergy-dominated, whereas tropical ecosystems and Arctic regions exhibit unique spatial variability in synergy and redundancy. These findings advance our understanding of how complex climate-ecosystem interactions shape carbon fluxes and offer insights for improving predictive models of NEE under changing climatic conditions."

In this study, we present a detailed analysis by explicitly quantifying the role of the tropical Indian Ocean (IO) on the initial uncertainty of CP-El Niño predictions. We identify optimal observation sites within the tropical IO that significantly reduce this uncertainty and validate their efficacy through observing system simulation experiments within a fully coupled climate prediction system. Our results demonstrate a remarkable achievement in the root mean squared errors of the prediction initial conditions using Community Earth System Model. This study not only enriches our understanding of the interplay between the tropical IO and CP-El Niño but also offers a concrete strategy for enhancing CP-El Niño forecasts, advancing seasonal prediction capabilities, and bolstering global resilience against the escalating frequency of CP-El Niño events."

However, smoke management is often considered a barrier to prescribed fire. Additionally, climate change will likely affect the frequency of acceptable meteorological conditions for prescribed burning, potentially restricting the use of the practice. Here, we examine the air quality impacts from prescribed fire and wildfire in the Southeastern U.S., the populations affected by smoke in the region, and how these impacts may change under climate change. We rely on projections of wildfire burn area and climate-driven shifts in the frequency of meteorological conditions adequate for prescribed burning, as well as a survey of Southeastern land managers investigating their anticipated response to these changes. Based on this information, we use chemical transport modeling to assess the contributions of wildfire and prescribed fire to air pollution, and project how smoke impacts may vary due to climate change and different land manager responses. We find that prescribed fire is responsible for a significant fraction of regional particulate matter pollution. Populations exposed to the most smoke tend to have higher fractions of people of color and low income. Depending on how land managers respond to changes in atmospheric conditions under climate change, prescribed fire smoke may decrease slightly in the areas with the heaviest burning or increase across much of the Southeast. Projections also show that climate-driven changes in wildfire and prescribed burning may impact compliance with recently updated air quality standards. The analysis assesses the potential consequences of climate change on air pollution over a region in which wildland fire is extensively managed, providing insight into land management strategies that call for increased application of prescribed fire."

Urban land teleconnection approach,"Confronted by climate change, enterprises are increasingly launching afforestation initiatives to develop carbon sinks and enhance their environmental, social, and governance performance. Due to the limited availability of land in urban areas—where most corporate headquarters are located—many firms rely on rural and overseas regions to implement these projects. This phenomenon reflects a form of urban land teleconnection (ULT), a key concept in urban sustainability that emphasizes the spatial and functional linkages between urban activities and land-use changes in geographically distant areas. This study investigates ULT through the lens of corporate afforestation behavior in Taiwan. A theoretical framework, supported by empirical analysis, is developed to explain how urban-based corporations influence land use beyond their municipal boundaries. The findings indicate that corporates in urban areas, particularly those with substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, actively compensate for local land constraints by investing in afforestation in less urbanized domestic areas and abroad. Notably, Taipei City records the highest level of corporate GHG emissions in 2022, totaling 73.94 MtCO2e—equivalent to 42.4% of the total among publicly listed firms (174.39 MtCO2e). Given severe land scarcity, Taipei-based enterprises engage in afforestation activities on 256.6 hectares domestically (55% of domestic corporate afforestation) and 29 446 hectares internationally (99% of overseas afforestation). These results underscore the growing reliance of high-emission urban corporations on external land resources and highlight their critical role in reshaping regional and transboundary land-use dynamics under emerging net-zero governance frameworks."

These strategies may differ in their associated feasibility challenges, mitigation co-impacts, and ultimately their relative societal desirability. Understanding these scenario characteristics is therefore crucial when scenarios are used to inform strategic decisions. One approach to enhance this understanding is to establish scenario archetypes and select contrasting illustrative scenarios from a larger ensemble. We present a new multidimensional framework for the systematic comparison of scenarios at the global or regional level. We illustrate the framework with comparisons in seven dimensions: economic feasibility, mineral resource availability, impacts on societal resilience, near-term scenario robustness, environmental sustainability, interregional fairness, and speed of societal transformation. Using cluster analysis, the framework can be used to select a group of illustrative scenarios with contrasting scores across the dimensions. Beyond the selection of scenarios, our exploration and evaluation framework also allows the identification of gaps in the scenario space that may be of interest but are not covered by the literature. We demonstrate these use cases by applying our framework to a set of mitigation scenarios that limit warming to 1.5 °C. Our results show our framework systematically selects contrasting scenarios, with our illustrative pathways having diverging energy mixes and uses of carbon dioxide removal. Further, we highlight considerable regional differences in the distribution of indicator and dimension scores as a key area for further investigation."

This study investigates the role of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) in this extreme event and its impact on crop yields, using a 525-member ensemble from the HadGEM3 atmospheric model and the WOFOST agricultural model, respectively. Observational results indicate that the area-averaged surface air temperature anomaly (TAS) was 1.4 °C higher than usual, and the percentage of anomalous precipitation was nearly 33% below normal, making both metrics the most extreme since 1960. The hot event was predominantly driven by ACC, contributing about 60% to the TAS strength and increasing its likelihood 7 fold. In contrast, internal climate variability appears to have been the primary trigger of the severe drought, although ACC significantly increased its likelihood by 9 fold. When these two extreme conditions are considered together as a concurrent hot-drought event, ACC increased its probability by about 3 fold. An attribution analysis of crop yields in the area was also conducted, revealing that ACC significantly shifts the probability distribution westward and reduces yields for both the winter wheat and rapeseed. Specifically, based on the simulated 2023 crop yield results driven by ERA5 as a proxy for observations, the likelihood of achieving the yield for winter wheat would have decreased by a factors of about 2 under ACC, while that for winter rapeseed is close to 1, despite its better simulation performance in the historical context. This underscores the challenge of accurately modeling and projecting crop yields under changing climate conditions. Additional analysis emphasizes the role of land–atmosphere interactions in amplifying the hot-drought event, as early-season soil moisture deficits reduced evapotranspiration and increased sensible heat flux, thereby intensifying local temperature extremes. Overall, global warming caused by anthropogenic activities has significantly increased the frequency of extreme hot drought events in Southwestern China, posing a severe threat to agricultural productivity."

Potential future changes in the frequency or intensity of such compound flood events are therefore of utmost importance. To assess such changes, large and consistent ensembles with storm surge and hydrological models are needed, but are hardly available. Often the occurrence of compound flood events is linked to the presence of certain atmospheric circulation types. Future changes in the frequency of such patterns can be directly inferred from available climate simulations. A frequently used classification of atmospheric circulation types are the so-called ‘Großwetterlagen’ by Hess and Brezowsky. In this study, possible future changes in the occurrence of these ‘Großwetterlagen’ were analysed using data from 31 realisations of CMIP6 climate simulations for the emission scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. Given the subjective nature of the classification, a deep learning ensemble for the automatic classification was developed and applied. In winter, a higher frequency of the atmospheric pattern Cyclonic Westerly towards 2100 could be inferred as a robust result among all models and scenarios. As this circulation type is potentially associated with compound flooding in some parts of the European coasts, this points towards potentially increasing risks from compound flooding in the future."

This study first introduces novel growth models grounded in the concept of accumulation phenomena, providing a new perspective while achieving a balanced integration of model accuracy and complexity. Second, by combining MaxEnt model with the growth model, we project the future dynamics of forest carbon in the Contiguous United States (CONUS), considering forest aging, climate-induced forest loss and shifts in forest compositions. Our findings reveal a consistent upward trend in total aboveground biomass (AGB), but the potential increase is limited, with AGB projected to rise by only 11.6% to 14.0% by 2080 compared to 2020. The characteristics and dominant limits of AGB potential vary across different regions of the CONUS. For instance, the West region exhibits the highest resilience to climate change, with AGB potential increasing by 37.4% to 38.3% in 2080 compared to 2020. However, the AGB potential is approaching saturation due to the aging forest structure. The Midwest region demonstrates heightened vulnerability to climate change, with AGB projected to decline nearly 22%–25% by 2080 compared to 2020. This projected decline is primarily due to the Midwest region undergoing the most severe plot loss and shifts in forest composition among all regions, with a changed plot rate of 40.7% to 47.3% in 2080.

This study presents a novel approach to constrain variability in projection simulations over Eurasia by exploiting the spatial patterns of teleconnection between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the near-surface air temperature (SAT). The constraint evaluates simulated and observed NAO-temperature teleconnection patterns during 20 year windows prior to making predictions. The resulting top ranking members are used to make predictions for the next 10 years. We find here that the constrained ensemble is skillful in predicting winter SAT on multi-annual to decadal timescales over Eurasia. We also find that the constrained multi-annual predictions yield higher correlation skill compared to both the unconstrained ensemble and the initialized predictions, especially up to 5 year mean winter SAT predictions. Therefore, we argue that for the Eurasia region, the constraint could provide skillful winter SAT predictions on multi-annual timescales with minimal cost compared to the state of the art initialized decadal climate predictions for which added value from initialization wanes quickly after the first forecast year."

This study examines the responses of heavy precipitation, represented by the maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5day), over China under an idealized CDR scenario using five models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6). The results reveal an asymmetric response, indicating that China may experience more severe heavy precipitation events compared to the pre-industrial (PI, 1850–1900) period, even if CO2 concentrations are reduced to PI levels. From June to September, the increase in Rx5day across most of China relative to the PI stage is primarily driven by upward air motions and the convergence of water vapor flux. The regions with overshoot are linked to southward movement of westerly jet, as well as shifts in vertical motion. A moisture budget diagnosis demonstrates that the thermal term plays a dominant role in promoting water vapor convergence across most of China, while the dynamic term leads to water vapor divergence in specific areas. These results in corresponding increases and decreases in extreme precipitation, respectively. Specifically, water vapor advection associated with the thermal term, along with the convergence and divergence linked to the dynamic term, serves as the principal determinants influencing the distribution of water vapor changes in China from June to September.

While many studies rely on remote sensing-based ecological indices, biophysical modeling of ESs remains limited, despite its importance for guiding sustainable solar farm development and regional ecological security. This study used process-based ES models, spatiotemporal trend analysis, and the propensity score matching method to assess changes in carbon sequestration (CS), sand fixation (SF), and soil retention (SR) around the world’s largest Talatan solar farms across pre-construction, construction, and post-construction phases (2011–2020). The main results were as follows: (1) From 2011 to 2020, CS, SF, and SR within the solar farm increased by 71.1%, 81.4%, and 32.1%, respectively, indicating an overall enhancement following construction. In the post-construction phase, the increase in CS was more pronounced within the solar farms, while improvements in SF and SR were greater in the surrounding buffer zone. (2) When focusing on the solar farms’ impact, both SF and SR exhibited clear thresholds around 400–500 m during construction and post-construction phases, while CS showed spatial differentiation mainly after construction, indicating that the most pronounced positive impacts were confined within this range. (3) Environmental factor including soil moisture index and land surface temperature were found to significantly influence these trends, reflecting the changes in ESs primarily driven by water and thermal conditions.

 The lifetime of cirrus clouds from deep convection plays an important role in determining their overall cloud radiative effect (CRE). The net CRE of cirrus clouds from deep convection is close to zero over their whole lifetime. This CRE is the result of a near-cancellation of a large shortwave (SW) cooling and large longwave (LW) warming, such that small changes in cirrus properties have the potential to produce a significant net radiative effect. Changes in the atmospheric and sea surface temperature structure, along with changes in anthropogenic aerosol, have been hypothesised to impact the lifetime of detrained cirrus clouds, altering this radiative balance. Constraining the potential CRE response to changes in cirrus lifetime is therefore vital to understand the strength of these proposed climate forcings and feedbacks.This paper tracks the evolution of detrained cirrus clouds along trajectories from deep convection. The total cirrus CRE in the tropics is found to be warming, at 11.2 ± 0.4 W m−2. It is found that cirrus clouds along trajectories from oceanic origin convection have a warming CRE of 10.0 ± 0.4 W m−2. In contrast, cirrus clouds along trajectories from land convection have a warming of 15.9 ± 0.7 W m−2 throughout their lifetime. This contrast is predominantly due to differences in the diurnal cycle of the initial convection over land and ocean.A proposed extension to the lifetime of the detrained cirrus leads to changes in the total cirrus CRE in the tropics. In all cases, doubling the lifetime of the detrained cirrus leads to an increase in the total cirrus CRE of 0.6 ± 0.1 W m−2. Whilst there is uncertainty in the strength of mechanisms responsible for a change in cirrus lifetime, this work provides an important constraint on the impact that any potential lifetime extension may have."

Thai,Occurrence and Emission Evaluation of Oxypurinol and Metformin from Effluent in WWTPs across Australia,"Oxypurinol is a metabolite of allopurinol, a drug used to treat gout, and metformin is a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Both oxypurinol and metformin enter the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in high loads, but information about their potential environmental risks remains scarce. This study systematically investigated the occurrence, emission, removal rate, and environmental risks of oxypurinol and metformin in effluents from 88 and 65 WWTPs across Australia in 2016 and 2021, respectively. Oxypurinol and metformin were frequently detected in effluents (>90%), with concentrations reaching up to 233 μg/L. The estimated per capita emissions of oxypurinol were 12 and 15 mg·day–1·capita–1, and those of metformin were 2.7 and 2.0 mg·day–1·capita–1 in 2016 and 2021, respectively. Both compounds were detected in effluents at concentrations up to 166 times above their respective PNECs. On average, dilution factors of 3.5 and 10 for metformin and 34 and 405 for oxypurinol are required for being released into river and ocean environments, respectively. During wastewater treatment, oxypurinol exhibited high persistence, with 54% of the WWTP sites showing no observed removal, whereas metformin showed an average removal rate of 88%. These findings provide valuable evidence of oxypurinol and metformin emissions and their environmental risk in Australia."

Given the impact of 6PPDQ on aquatic life in urban streams, we addressed the acute toxicity of 6PPDQ exposure on coastal cutthroat trout (CCT) (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii), a species sympatric with coho salmon in natal watersheds. Using static exposures coupled with analytical chemistry, we determined the 24-h LC50 values for alevin (297.2 ng/L), swim-up fry (39.6 ng/L), 5-month parr (103.3 ng/L), and 13-month juveniles (185.9 ng/L)─values similar to toxicity observed in coho salmon. Additionally, the 96-h LC50 (77.6 ng/L) was 2.4 times more lethal for juvenile CCT. We assessed potential effects of sublethal 6PPDQ exposure on disease resistance to infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN), an endemic viral disease of Pacific salmon, and to swimming performance. Sublethal 6PPDQ (53.6 ng/L) did not affect survival of parr exposed to IHN virus compared to virus alone. Conversely, 6PPDQ exposure as low as 72.2 ng/L significantly reduced 15- and 24-month juvenile swimming performance, and 120.5 ng/L 6PPDQ increased blood hematocrit. Overall, CCT are the second most sensitive species tested to date for 6PPDQ sensitivity which further emphasizes the need for identifying alternatives to 6PPD."

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain a mystery. Here, maternal mice were exposed to As via drinking water. Subsequently, the hippocampi of their offspring were collected at different developmental stages to explore the dynamic changes during hippocampal maturation and the effects of As. Time-series RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant temporal correlation between As neurodevelopmental toxicity and the mRNA expression profile of the hippocampal region during critical postnatal developmental windows. Further, downregulation of genes associated with neurogenesis and telomere maintenance was observed. Notably, dynamic changes in hippocampal telomeres were observed in response to As exposure, with critically shortened telomeres inhibiting neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation, impairing neuroblast maturation, and reducing the number and size of neurospheres. Additionally, the populations of BrdU+ and MAP2+ cells were decreased while GFAP+ cells were increased, indicating a decline in NSCs stemness. Furthermore, As exposure significantly impaired dendritic complexity in the hippocampus of mice, altered dendritic spine morphology, and disrupted synaptic ultrastructure, ultimately leading to cognitive impairment.

It is missing the narrow, magma‐rich morphology observed in the Main Ethiopian Rift that cuts through the Ethiopian Plateau. Instead, diffuse faulting and isolated volcanic centers are widespread over several hundred kilometers. Turkana has also experienced less magmatism over the last 30 Myr than adjacent plateaus, despite having a thin crust and residing above a mantle that is inferred to be hot and partially molten. We hypothesize that lithospheric weakening has been the key control on magma transport across the lithosphere in the Turkana Depression and subsequent rift development. Using poro‐viscoelastic–viscoplastic models of melt transport, we show that magma extraction across a thin, weakened lithosphere is slower than across a thick, elastic lithosphere. Our results suggest that pre‐rift lithospheric strength can explain the magma‐poor character of Turkana for most of its tectonic history."

A comparison of char and soot in fine particles in megacity Beijing and its southwest upwind rural site, Gucheng, during winter haze in 2018 was conducted, utilizing dual‐carbon isotope constrained positive matrix factorization for source apportionment. BC concentrations in Gucheng were twice those in Beijing, with char accounting for 90% of BC at both sites. Despite similar char/soot ratios, source contributions of char and soot differed significantly between the two sites. Fossil fuel combustion emerged as the major source of char in both Beijing (82.1%) and Gucheng (72.1%), with higher contributions to soot (96.3% and 86.2%, respectively). Heavy oil combustion (51.2%) was the predominant source of char in Beijing, the char/soot values from which had been previously underestimated.

One of the challenges of evaluating future AR projections is in defining future Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT) thresholds to use to identify ARs. The two main methods are to use a percentile of IVT based on the historical climate (fixed) or a percentile based on the future climate (relative). Although most global studies of future ARs use a fixed method, the choice of thresholding method can lead to different future projections. This study assesses the sensitivity of future projections (2080–2100) of AR frequency and precipitation impacts over Australia to the IVT thresholding method using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 data under a moderate (SSP245) and high (SSP585) emissions scenario. We found that both thresholding methods lead to an increase (or no change) in AR frequency but there is considerable variation in the magnitude of the projected increase in AR frequency. Both methods suggest that heavy AR‐associated precipitation will increase along with the occurrence of no rain during AR events over southeast Australia, whereas there may be a reduction in both light and heavy AR precipitation over southwest Australia. Using a fixed method leads to a drier projection for AR‐associated precipitation and identifies weaker ARs. As the driest inhabited continent, understanding future precipitation and how rain‐bearing weather systems, such as ARs, may change in a warmer climate is important for managing risk to Australia's future water availability."

This study applies an advanced “space‐and‐time” method combined with high‐quality satellite products to comprehensively assess the impacts of 57 PV plants for different land cover types in China. The results indicate an overall surface albedo decrease (−0.025; −10.9%) due to PV constructions, with the largest decrease in barren lands (−0.03; −12.2%) and more pronounced variation in winter. Moreover, the decreases in direct and diffuse albedo caused by PV installations are comparable. PV‐induced surface broadband emissivity (BBE) changes vary in sign, with plants in barren lands exhibiting a relatively consistent pattern (1.7 × 10−3; 0.2%). The combined effect of PV‐induced surface albedo and BBE changes contribute to surface land surface temperature (LST) variations. Daytime LST decreases more markedly (–0.36 K) with greater seasonal variation than nighttime LST (−0.07 K), dominating the daily mean LST changes (−0.23 K). Correlation analysis indicates that PV plants exhibit different cooling mechanisms during the day and night. Changes in surface ET caused by PV constructions reflect variations in vegetation, with croplands experiencing the strongest reduction (−2.13 mm/year; −1.0%), particularly in summer.

 How does the brain convert visual input into specific motor actions1,2? In Drosophila, visual projection neurons (VPNs)3,4 perform this visuomotor transformation by converting retinal positional information into synapse number in the brain5. The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unknown. We addressed this issue in LPLC2 (ref. 6), a VPN type that detects looming motion and preferentially drives escape behaviour to stimuli approaching from the dorsal visual field with progressively weaker responses ventrally. This correlates with a dorsoventral gradient of synaptic inputs into and outputs from LPLC2. Here we report that LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space exhibit graded expression of cell recognition molecules matching these synaptic gradients. Dpr13 shapes LPLC2 outputs by binding DIP-ε in premotor descending neurons mediating escape. Beat-VI shapes LPLC2 inputs by binding Side-II in upstream motion-detecting neurons. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that these molecular gradients act instructively to determine synapse number. These patterns, in turn, fine-tune the perception of the stimulus and drive the behavioural response. Similar transcriptomic variation within neuronal types is observed in the vertebrate brain7 and may shape synapse number via gradients of cell recognition molecules acting through both genetically hard-wired programs and experience.

 Midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) signal reward-prediction errors that teach recipient circuits about expected rewards1. However, DANs are thought to provide a substrate for temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning (RL), an algorithm that learns the mean of temporally discounted expected future rewards, discarding useful information about experienced distributions of reward amounts and delays2. Here we present time–magnitude RL (TMRL), a multidimensional variant of distributional RL that learns the joint distribution of future rewards over time and magnitude. We also uncover signatures of TMRL-like computations in the activity of optogenetically identified DANs in mice during behaviour. Specifically, we show that there is significant diversity in both temporal discounting and tuning for the reward magnitude across DANs. These features allow the computation of a two-dimensional, probabilistic map of future rewards from just 450 ms of the DAN population response to a reward-predictive cue. Furthermore, reward-time predictions derived from this code correlate with anticipatory behaviour, suggesting that similar information is used to guide decisions about when to act. Finally, by simulating behaviour in a foraging environment, we highlight the benefits of a joint probability distribution of reward over time and magnitude in the face of dynamic reward landscapes and internal states. These findings show that rich probabilistic reward information is learnt and communicated to DANs, and suggest a simple, local-in-time extension of TD algorithms that explains how such information might be acquired and computed. An algorithm called time–magnitude reinforcement learning (TMRL) extends distributional reinforcement learning to take account of reward time and magnitude, and behavioural and neurophysiological experiments in mice suggest that midbrain dopamine neurons use TMRL-like computations."

 Building a useful photonic quantum computer requires robust techniques to synthesize optical states that can encode qubits. Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP) states1 offer one of the most attractive classes of such qubit encodings, as they enable the implementation of universal gate sets with straightforward, deterministic and room temperature-compatible Gaussian operations2. Existing pioneering demonstrations generating optical GKP states3 and other complex non-Gaussian states4–11 have relied on free-space optical components, hindering the scaling eventually required for a utility-scale system. Here we use an ultra-low-loss integrated photonic chip fabricated on a customized multilayer silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform, coupled over fibre with high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors, to generate GKP qubit states. These states show critical mode-level features necessary for fault tolerance, including at least four resolvable peaks in both p and q quadratures, and a clear lattice structure of negative Wigner function regions, in this case a 3 × 3 grid. We also show that our GKP states show sufficient structure to indicate that the devices used to make them could, after further reduction in optical losses, yield states for the fault-tolerant regime. This experiment validates a key pillar of bosonic architectures for photonic quantum computing2,12, paving the way for arrays of GKP sources that will supply future fault-tolerant machines.

Here, authors demonstrate a compact photonic chip-based interleaver multiplying pulse rates of mode-locked lasers to 14 GHz, significantly enhancing microwave power and reducing phase noise. 
 Optically generated microwaves exhibit unprecedented low noise, benefiting applications such as communications, radar, instrumentation, and metrology. To date, the purest microwave signals are produced using optical frequency division with femtosecond mode-locked lasers. However, their typical repetition rates of hundreds of MHz require multiplication methods to reach the microwave domain. Here, we introduce a miniaturized photonic integrated circuit-based interleaver, achieving a 64-fold multiplication of the repetition rate from 216 MHz to 14 GHz in Ku-Band. With the interleaver, the generated microwave power was improved by 35 dB, with a phase noise floor reduced by more than 10 folds by alleviating photodetector saturation. Based on a low-loss and high-density Si3N4 waveguides, six cascaded stages of Mach-Zehnder interferometers with optical delay lines up to 33 centimeters long are fully integrated into a compact chip.

A mechanically gated transistor with nonvolatile, multi-level states shows promise for tactile-sensing applications. 
 Beyond conventional electrical modulation, flexoelectricity enables mechanical control of ferroelectric polarizations, offering a pathway for tactile-responsive ferroelectric systems. However, mechanical polarization switching typically requires substantial static threshold forces to overcome the significant energy barrier, resulting in material fatigue and slow response that compromises reliability and hinders practical applications. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing an imprint field through asymmetric electrostatic boundary design with distinct work functions. This built-in electric field stabilizes the energy landscape, effectively lowering the polarization switching barrier. Subsequently, nonvolatile polarization switching with a low threshold force of 12 nN·nm−1 is achieved in CuInP2S6 without material damage. Surpassing the limitations of slow static force controls, our work marks the first experimental demonstration of fast mechanical control of polarization switching with 4 millisecond-long low force pulses. To further highlight the potential of this rapid, low-force mechanical control, we propose a van der Waals heterostructured mechanically gated transistor with asymmetric electrostatic boundary, which exhibits gate force pulses-controlled multi-level, nonvolatile conductance states. Our findings establish a paradigm for next-generation ferroelectric electronics that integrate responsiveness to mechanical stimuli.

 Visible-light-absorbing semiconductor nanocrystals have shown great promise as photocatalysts for promoting photoredox chemistry. However, their utilization in organic synthesis remains considerably limited compared to small molecule photosensitizers. Recently, the generation of hot electrons from quantum-confined systems has emerged as a powerful means of photoreduction, yet the efficiencies remain limited under mild conditions. In this study, we present an efficient hot-electron generation system facilitated by the spin-exchange Auger process in Mn2+-doped CdS/ZnS quantum dots.

Notably, these reactions accommodate substrate reduction potentials as low as −3.4 V versus the saturated calomel electrode. Through two-photon excitation, we achieve the generation of a “super” photoreductant using visible-light irradiation power that is only 1% of that previously reported for molecular and quantum dot systems. By modulating the intensity of light output, the spin-exchange Auger process enables the on/off generation of hot electrons, allowing for programmable assembly-point cross-coupling cascades.

Using poplar and lignin model compounds, the authors demonstrate that the sequential demand for surface-bound hydrogen during hydrogenolysis creates temporal windows that allow catalytic oxidation events to take place, even within an overall hydrogen-rich, reductive environment. 
 Hydrogenolysis of lignin generates a portfolio of products, the yields of which are generally calculated using a subset of phenolic monomers that are dependent on the lignin composition, product distribution, and analytical technique. Some lignins are naturally γ-acylated; poplar lignins, for example, have p-hydroxybenzoate groups on 1–15% of their syringyl subunits. Upon hydrogenolysis, it is generally assumed that the p-hydroxybenzoate is cleaved before the deacylated lignin is depolymerized. Hydrogenolysis of model γ-p-hydroxybenzoylated β-aryl ethers do not, however, produce the deacylated β-aryl ether intermediates, as was previously conjectured; products instead derive from palladium-assisted reactions on the cinnamyl p-hydroxybenzoates resulting in initial β-ether cleavage. The p-hydroxybenzoate moiety itself also undergoes carboxylate-assisted palladium-catalyzed C–H bond activation to form the 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, that subsequently converts to the 2,4-dihydroxycyclohex-1-enoate. These details underscore previously unrecognized pathways and products that are key to understanding the different hydrogenolysis product distributions from naturally acylated lignins that are prevalent biomass-conversion feedstocks.

 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with the target mRNAs to induce translational repression and mRNA degradation. Interestingly, miRNAs themselves can turnover rapidly when binding to a target RNA with extensive complementarity, a phenomenon called target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD). To date, all validated TDMD “triggers” can induce miRNA degradation reside in non-coding regions of the RNA. We found that TDMD triggers placed in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of a reporter degraded miRNAs more effectively than those in the coding sequence (CDS). Inhibiting translation of the reporter enhanced miRNA degradation by the CDS trigger, indicating that ribosome-free CDS triggers are more accessible to miRNAs. By small RNA sequencing, we explored mammalian miRNAs sensitive to global translation status. Yet, no endogenous CDS trigger could be confidently assigned to these miRNAs. Our work revealed the intricate relationship between translation and TDMD, and explains the paucity of effective TDMD triggers in the CDS.

 Intensive irrigation in the North China Plain (NCP) raises environmental concerns, yet its climate impacts remain inconsistent among current modeling studies. These inconsistencies may arise from deficiencies in existing models. To better capture irrigation impact, we employed a recently improved irrigation model tailored for the NCP, which significantly enhances simulations of crop growth and irrigation application. Results reveal that irrigation exerts competing effects on precipitation: enhancing it in May and June by increasing rainfall frequency and intensity, while suppressing it in July and August by reducing intensity. Spatial precipitation changes correlate with upper-tropospheric humidity, while inter-annual changes link to geopotential height and wind anomalies. This suggests that irrigation-induced surface cooling and moisturizing modulate atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamic structures, influencing convective precipitation unevenly across regions and time, leading to complex precipitation changes.

 Subseasonal prediction of Arctic sea ice and associated atmospheric conditions during the melting season remains challenging due to limited understanding of sea ice initial conditions. This study integrates sea ice assimilation into the coupled model FGOALS-f2 using the localized error subspace transform ensemble Kalman filter, and conducts subseasonal predictions starting from August 1st over 2004–2023. Results show that simultaneous assimilation of sea ice concentration (SIC) and thickness (SIT) significantly improves sea ice predictions for up to two months, while assimilating SIC alone primarily benefits one-month lead predictions. SIT assimilation provides added predictive value for surface air temperature (SAT) forecasts beyond SIC assimilation alone, effectively extending the atmospheric influence of sea ice initial conditions to two months. This improvement in SAT predictions is primarily attributed to a more realistic representation of the surface energy budget. These findings highlight the pivotal role of summer SIT assimilation to enhance subseasonal predictions in the Arctic and challenge the conventional view that initial conditions affect only short-term forecasts. This study underscores the necessity for better representation of ice–atmosphere interactions in models and advocates for enhanced observational capabilities for summer SIT to improve subseasonal predictions in the Arctic and surrounding regions."

 Clay surfaces have been invoked as crucial components in the origin of life processes due to their ability to concentrate organics and abiotically catalyse (bio)polymer production. Still, the importance of the mutual nature of organo-clay interactions and the effects of off-world organics in this interplay is a largely unexplored realm. We demonstrate a previously unrecognised phenomenon that occurs upon the transient interaction of montmorillonite clay with the meteorite-common, non-proteinogenic γ-aminobutyric acid. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction show that an irreversible structural change is induced by the off-world species. A distinct partial clay exfoliation is correlated with the formation of nanoscale cavities in the mid-layers of the original structure, observable using transmission electron microscopy. This work demonstrates that an exogenous amino acid can alter clay and introduce 3D confined nano-environments, which may facilitate compartmentalisation in prebiotic times.

 The largest Ediacaran carbon isotope excursion (the Shuram excursion, SE) has been proposed to coincide with a transient oceanic oxygenation event. However, the mechanisms responsible for the SE and the associated oxygenation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of silicate weathering during the SE by measuring Li isotope compositions from two suites of marine carbonates in the Ediacaran Doushantuo sections. Our results reveal a pronounced negative lithium isotope excursion during the SE, which cannot be attributed to mineralogical effects and argues against a diagenetic origin for the SE. Instead, box model simulations of lithium-strontium cycles suggest a pulsed phase of enhanced congruent continental weathering during the SE. This increased weathering would have significantly elevated the input of essential nutrients into the ocean, boosting primary production, which in turn led to transient oceanic oxygenation. This process may also explain the negative δ13Ccarb excursion, as it could result from the oxidation of upwelling dissolved organic carbon in shallow seawater. Continental weathering likely played a crucial role in regulating climate, seawater chemistry, and Earth’s surface oxidation state during the SE. Pulse enhanced weathering of trans-Gondwanan super mountains during the Ediacaran Shuram carbon isotope excursion, potentially increased nutrient inputs in the ocean which resulted in transient oceanic oxygenation, according to dynamic box modeling, geochemistry data, and Li isotope composition analysis of carbonate Ediacaran sections in south China."

 The Scanning Microwave Spectrometer (SCAMS) onboard the NIMBUS-6 satellite operated between 15 June 1975 and 1 June 1976. Its primary mission objective was to map tropospheric temperature profiles for improving weather predictions, measuring Brightness Temperature(s) (TBs) at five different frequencies (22.235, 31.65, 52.85, 53.85 and 55.45 GHz). However, the top-of-the-atmosphere emission measured at the 22.235 and the 31.65 GHz radiometer channels on the satellite are dominated by surface emission over polar open water and sea ice and can therefore be used for mapping sea ice concentration (SIC) on large scale (∼100 km).Here we present a SIC and ice type data set, which is based on the TB observations of the two lowest frequencies of SCAMS (center frequencies at 22.235 & 31.65 GHz). While the SCAMS channels do not completely align with the usual frequencies for sea ice retrievals (19, 22 and 37 GHz) in modern processing methods, it is still possible to apply modern techniques to reduce noise in the data. The SIC dataset provides important insights into the sea ice concentration, extent and type of the mid 1970s, where other satellite datasets e.g. the NIMBUS-5 ESMR have gaps and irregular coverage. The SCAMS data has been processed following modern methods, including a regional noise reduction over open water using a simple radiative transfer model, land-spillover corrections and estimation of uncertainties, as well as dynamical tie-points to calibrate the algorithm. The data set has been resampled into daily files with EUMETSAT’s OSI-SAF and ESA CCI compatible daily grids and land masks, for easier comparison with other data sets, such as the modern multi-frequency period starting with NIMBUS-7 SMMR in October 1978 to present and the 1972–1977 period covered by the NIMBUS-5 ESMR with some interruptions. The SCAMS TBs were processed with a hybrid SIC algorithm, combining a one and a two-channel algorithm over open water and ice respectively.We find that the SIC calculated by the two-channel algorithm has more noise over water and low SIC areas than the single-channel algorithm. However, the two-channel algorithm does not systematically underestimate SIC in regions covered by Multi Year Ice (MYI) as the single channel algorithm does. A classification of sea ice types for First Year Ice (FYI) and MYI in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) proved successful, while it was also possible to identify two surface types A and B for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) sea ice, with different radiometric signatures.A comparison of monthly mean sea ice extent (SIE) with the NIMBUS-5 ESMR showed good alignment in the both hemispheres, where the SCAMS SIE is larger by 386 676 km2 and 251 304 km2 on average in the NH and SH, respectively. SCAMS fills a gap in the N5ESMR record including the Arctic SIE minimum and the Antarctic maximum in 1975."

 To assimilate passive microwave data in numerical weather prediction, a comprehensive understanding of the components of the radiative transfer equation is essential. Given the significant variability of emissivity in snow-covered regions — affected by frequency, polarisation, and the macro- and microstructural properties of snow — attention must be paid to the design of a forward model. However, existing physical models are unsuitable for global-scale studies due to their reliance on numerous inputs, such as snow grain size across different layers, which are typically unavailable at larger scales. In this study, we propose a method that utilises geophysical properties accessible at the continental scale to derive accurate emissivity values for frequencies ranging from 1 GHz to 90 GHz, in both vertical and horizontal polarisations, with a focus on the incident angles of conical scanners (approximately 50°). Our approach employs neural networks to obtain a robust forward model using geophysical variables as input data. A training dataset was developed based on satellite-derived surface emissivity from the SMOS and AMSR2 instruments by subtracting atmospheric components and surface temperature modulation. The results, which accounts for the actual geophysical state of the surface and its temporal variability, outperform the emissivity climatologies. We achieved snow-covered surface emissivities at the continental scale with a correlation coefficient above 0.9 and a RMSE below 0.02 for frequencies up to 18.7 GHz, and around 0.03 for higher frequencies. Additionally, we demonstrate that, in a typical tundra snowpack where the macro- and microstructural properties of snow can be obtained, the emissivities retrieved by our neural network-based forward model are consistent with results from the physical model (SMRT). This proposed model will also support preparations for the CIMR mission."

 Imaging spectroscopy has become a pivotal technique for estimating plant traits at the canopy scale. Accurate trait prediction is critical for biodiversity conservation, yet research on canopy traits in heterogeneous wetlands with complex species mixtures remains scarce. While the Community-Weighted Mean (CWM) method has been widely used for upscaling leaf traits to the canopy level, it often suffers from low model precision, and the suitability of alternative upscaling methods for predicting canopy mean traits using imaging spectroscopy remains uncertain. This study proposed a novel approach for calculating canopy mean traits using the geometric mean method and compared its performance to that of the CWM methods in combination with three modeling algorithms Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest regression (RF), and Support Vector Machine regression (SVM). The accuracy was evaluated by exploring the predictive ability for nine canopy mean traits by using high spatial resolution UAV multispectral data. The analysis focuses on a wetland ecosystem characterized by high species diversity and hydrological variability, where precise plant trait estimation is essential for ecological process modeling. The results demonstrated that the geometric mean method yielded the highest validation accuracy for most canopy mean traits when paired with the SVM model (e.g., R2 for N = 0.64, SLA = 0.38, and cellulose = 0.33). Notably, the geometric mean method, combined with UAV multispectral data, significantly enhanced the predictive performance for N, surpassing even that of hyperspectral data. This study underscores the potential of the geometric mean method for upscaling leaf traits to canopy traits. These findings contribute to advancing the prediction accuracy of plant functional traits through remote sensing techniques, while future studies may explore the integration of deep learning methods."

 The coastal region of Alexandria Governorate in Egypt holds significant strategic importance for trade while being susceptible to extreme weather events. It confronts a dual challenge of the rising sea levels and, as found in this study, land instability. While much attention has been rightly directed towards sea level rise (SLR), the stability of the land warrants equal consideration. Here, a comprehensive analysis of land stability is conducted in Alexandria by measuring Line of Sight (LOS) displacements and assessing their topographical, hydrological, and coastal impacts. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry technique is used to measure the LOS displacements in association with land cover classification and elevation data. Moreover, in the absence of a recent, openly accessible Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with satisfactory resolution, we developed a novel approach to update DEM using the Small Baseline Subset method. This approach enabled us to generate a projected DEM for the year 2040, facilitating the creation of a stream network based on this “future DEM”. Our observations revealed displacements ranging from −14.0 to 6.7 mm/year, predominantly occurring in low-lying and built-up areas, suggesting anthropogenic activities as a likely cause. The current and future stream networks show stream shifting and widening. Stream shifting indicates dynamic changes in topography and hydrological conditions, while stream widening suggests alterations in the hydrological network due to increased urban runoff or changes in the natural watershed. Furthermore, we found that sea surface temperature and SLR are projected to increase until the end of the century in the Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria. This escalation raises the likelihood of intensified tropical-like hurricane events in the region, commonly referred to as “medicanes”. The importance of this research is in offering a framework for comprehensive land stability assessments, along with demonstrating the scalability of the applied methodologies, including our distinct approach to generating both current and projected DEM."

 Due to its complex topography, the Lake Titicaca region, located in the southern tropical Andes, presents great challenges for atmospheric modeling. This study aims to improve the representation of precipitation and air surface temperature using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at high spatial resolution (2 km), during the austral summer of 2020. We conducted 11 experiments with different configurations of topography, land use, physical parameterizations, and lake surface temperature (LST). Each experiment was evaluated considering in-situ data from the Peruvian-Bolivian region and gridded precipitation products.For precipitation, the best configuration, with an average bias close to zero mm, includes using the GMTED2010 topography (not smoothed) and the land use data of Eva et al. (2004), along with the Purdue Lin microphysics and the Grell 3D cumulus scheme. For air temperature, the best configuration, which showed an average underestimation between 0 and − 0.5 °C, included the same topography and land use, along with the parameterization of the SENAMHI Operational Model (SOM), including the WRF Single Moment 3 microphysics and the Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme.In the last experiment, the sea surface temperature (SST) was updated, resulting in an average LST increase of +1.8 °C over Lake Titicaca. This resulted in an increase in the precipitation bias (82.2 %) due to increased evaporation and convection over the lake and decreased southwestward moisture transport. These results highlight the sensitivity of the WRF model to parameterization choices and SST forcing data, emphasizing the importance of any changes in these variables."

 The decreasing magnitude of the equatorial Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in the lower stratosphere has been found in observational and modelling evidence across various pressure levels. However, the origin of the QBO amplitude weakening is still not well understood, and the possible relationship between the QBO amplitude weakening and the tropical oceanic warming is seldom investigated in literature. Using the QBO and ocean surface temperature (SST) observations, this study qualitatively and quantitatively analyzes the possible relationship between synchronous SST warming across tropical oceans and the QBO weakening. As the tropical oceans warm synchronously, the QBO magnitude increases in the middle stratosphere and decreases in the lower stratosphere. Based on the continuous wavelet transform analysis, it is revealed that the QBO amplitude shows distinctive features on multiple timescales, while the main period characteristics of the QBO are relatively stable among various QBO datasets. The cross-wavelet analysis and lead-lag correlation analysis for the QBO amplitude and SSTs in different tropical oceans confirms the coupling between them. The correlation between tropical SST and QBO amplitude varies on different timescales. The modification of QBO amplitude by the tropical SSTs is more significant on longer timescales of more than 8 years than on the interannual timescales. The correlation between the tropical Western Pacific–Indian Ocean SSTs and QBO magnitude is much larger than that for the tropical Atlantic–Eastern Pacific Ocean SSTs. The trend analysis of tropical deep convection and Brewer-Dobson circulation verifies the interdecadal modulation of QBO amplitude by the tropical SSTs."

We show that the presence of Ydj1 within condensates abolishes phase transitions into amyloids, unlike tau-only droplets that spontaneously mature into amyloid fibrils. We identify the amyloidogenic hexapeptide motifs located in the hydrophobic microtubule-binding region of tau that interacts with the peptide-binding regions of Ydj1 promoting tau-Ydj1 condensate formation. Our results provide mechanistic underpinnings of condensate-mediated protein homeostasis."

The bacterial killing mechanism of chemokines and the biochemical properties that define which members of the chemokine superfamily are antimicrobial remain poorly understood. We report that the antimicrobial activity of chemokines is defined by their ability to bind phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, two anionic phospholipids commonly found in the bacterial plasma membrane. We show that only chemokines able to bind these two phospholipids kill bacteria and that they exert rapid bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects with a higher potency than the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin 3. Both biochemical and genetic interference with the chemokine-cardiolipin interaction impaired microbial growth arrest, bacterial killing, and membrane disruption by chemokines. Moreover, unlike conventional antibiotics,Escherichia colifailed to develop resistance when placed under increasing antimicrobial chemokine pressure in vitro. Thus, we have identified cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol as binding partners for chemokines responsible for chemokine antimicrobial action."

Mitochondrial activity, biomass, and efficiency are critical to this balance. While activity and biomass are well characterized in PD pathology, mitochondrial metabolic efficiency remains insufficiently explored. Our previous studies showed that the protein product of PD-associated gene DJ-1 modulates metabolic efficiency through its interaction with the F1Fo-ATP-synthase β subunit (β-sub). Here, using proximity ligation assay (PLA), we compared mitochondrial DJ-1-β-sub association in distinct mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neuronal subpopulations and their intracellular compartments of PD and control postmortem brains. In PD brains, DJ-1-β-sub-PLA was lower than control in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) somata and neurites but unchanged in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. In PD and control cases, the PLA signal was reduced in distal neurites of SNpc compared to VTA neurons. These intracellular and region-specific differences suggest that impaired mitochondrial efficiency may contribute to the differential vulnerability of mesDA neurons in PD."

Viroporins constitute a growing group of virus-encoded transmembrane oligomeric proteins that allow passage of small molecules across the membrane. Despite sparsity in viroporin structures, recent work has revealed diversity in both the number of transmembrane helices and oligomeric states. Here, we provide evidence that the small hydrophobic protein (SH) from mumps virus is a pentameric viroporin. From extensive biophysical data, a HADDOCK model of full-length SH shows its intracellular C-terminal region to form an extended structure crucial to stabilization of the pentamer. Heterologous expression of wild-type SH and variants inXenopus laevisoocytes reveals the viroporin as a chloride channel, with transport facilitated by conserved hydroxyl-carrying residues lining the pore. The channel function of SH is inhibited by the small-molecule BIT225, highlighting the potential for antiviral targeting through SH."

Here, we report a small luminescent molecule, TPA2PyPh, as a potent antibacterial agent and its potential for lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer strategy in treating bacterial sepsis. Engineered macrophages, created by directly incubating TPA2PyPh with macrophages, enabled the luminogen to precisely bind to intracellular lipid droplets. Upon engulfment of bacteria, these TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages use natural lipid uptake mechanisms to deliver the luminogen to intracellular bacteria, disrupting their membranes and inserting into the bacterial DNA, thereby inducing bacterial elimination. Our findings show that the adoptive transfer of TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages substantially diminishes bacterial burden in septic mice and substantially reduces mortality rates. This study demonstrates the potential of TPA2PyPh as an effective antibacterial agent and supports the use of adoptive lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer as an effective approach for treating sepsis and managing severe infectious diseases."

During development, guided by alveolar bone–derived PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor, B polypeptide),Cd24a+/Pax9+cells gradually concentrated on the apical region during the crown-to-root transition, collectively migrated and formed dental root. Cell ablation and conditional Wnt knockout notably compromised tooth establishment. Single-cell RNA sequencing, CUT&Tag, and spatial mapping further revealed distinct features ofCd24a+/Pax9+cells and their cellular organization. Last, theCD24+/PAX9+core was also present in human teeth, suggesting it as a conserved developmental program.

Our investigation of Syx17 function inDrosophilanephrocytes and salivary gland cells revealed unexpected effects. We find that Syx17 loss induces the formation of autophagosome-lysosome clusters in a HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting)–dependent manner, entrapping this tether, autophagosomes, and lysosomes. While locked in clusters, these organelles cannot participate in other vesicle fusions, impeding endosomal progression and autophagosome secretion. Therefore, the absence of Syx17 not only inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion but also prevents HOPS release from autophagosome-lysosome tethering sites causing a “tethering lock.” Preventing autophagosome formation or removing the HOPS adaptor Plekhm1 (pleckstrin homology domain–containing family M member 1) leads to release of HOPS and lysosomes from these clusters, thus rescuing secondary effects of Syx17 loss.

Anthracene and phenanthrene were detected isomer-selectively using photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves and mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE) spectra. While phenanthrene is produced through a radical-radical recombination of the carbon-centered radicals, anthracene may plausibly be formed through an unconventional radical addition to a low spin-density fluorenyl carbon.

Using ultracold gases, here, we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon- and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation.

Here, we propose a strategy for synthesizing functionalized Ga-based HEOs (GHEOs) at a low temperature (400°C) by the Ga integration mechanism. The negative mixing enthalpy between Ga and other metals reduces the Gibbs free energy, enabling the creation of homogeneous GHEOs through a hydrothermal process at a lower temperature. The Ga integration mechanism is supported by thermodynamic and density functional theory analyses. In particular, the perovskite, spinel, and rock salt crystal can be precisely tuned by choosing metal ions, enabling tailored applications in electrocatalysis, energy-saving materials, and methane sensors.

The continuous transformation pathway of a-DG is characterized by distinctive heterogeneous microstructural evolutions across a wide density range. We observed anomalous thermal conductivities in a-DG, which initially decrease and then increase with the density and sp3/sp2ratio, deviating markedly from previously reported trends. This anomaly originates from changes in phonon mean free path and phonon lifetime at the medium-frequency range (7 to 30 terahertz), dictated by the unique two-stage microtopological transition.

Manolopoulos,Nuclear quantum effects slow down the energy transfer in biological light-harvesting complexes,"We assess how quantum-mechanical effects associated with high-frequency chromophore vibrations influence excitation energy transfer in biological light-harvesting complexes. After defining a classical nuclear limit that is consistent with the quantum-classical equilibrium, we include nuclear quantum effects through a variational polaron transformation of the high-frequency vibrational modes. This approach is validated by comparison with fully quantum-mechanical benchmark calculations and applied to three prototypical light-harvesting complexes. For light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria, the inter-ring transfer is 1.5 times slower in the quantum treatment than in the classical treatment. For the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, the transfer rate is the same in both cases, whereas for light-harvesting complex II of spinach, the transfer is 1.7 times slower in the quantum treatment. The effect is most pronounced for systems with large excitonic energy gaps and strong vibronic coupling to high-frequency modes. In all cases, nuclear quantum effects are found to be unimportant for the directionality of energy transfer."

Loading single atoms is known to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, as their activity is heavily influenced by the microenvironment. Therefore, achieving precise control over the microenvironment of single atoms is crucial but remains a substantial challenge. Here, we reported a unique Pt–C/TiO2photocatalyst with Pt quantum dots (PtQD) and C-coordinated Pt single atoms (PtSA). Under the given experimental conditions, the hydrogen production rate reaches 43.2 mmol hour−1with 70 mg of the photocatalyst. Notably, the hydrogen molecules generated per incident photon (H2/photon) reach 0.92. The special coordination environment influenced by C not only provides a direct transmission channel for photogenerated electrons but also activates surrounding Ti, thus improving the separation of the electron-hole pairs and H2production performance. This research provides a prospect of efficient on-site hydrogen production."

Vogt;Peter Wang;Megan Chavez;Peng Guo;Edward Kai-Hua Chow;Dean Ho;Brian A. Aguado,Determining sex differences in aortic valve myofibroblast responses to drug combinations identified using a digital medicine platform,"Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a sexually dimorphic disease where aortic valve leaflets develop fibrosis and calcification, leading to heart failure if untreated. Sex differences in AVS progression depend on valvular interstitial cells (VICs) activating to myofibroblasts that drive aberrant extracellular matrix remodeling. To date, no treatment strategies have leveraged cellular sex differences to determine drug combinations that target VIC myofibroblast activation. Here, we harnessed IDentif.AI, an artificial intelligence (AI)–derived platform, to optimize sex-biased synergistic drug combinations that may prevent and reverse VIC myofibroblast activation on hydrogel biomaterials. The results reveal that sex-specific drug response models can be used to predict sex biases in drug efficacy and combinatorial interactions. This study provides a framework for developing AVS treatments through the integration of high-throughput hydrogel cell culture platforms and AI-driven drug optimization. Designing targeted AVS drug combinations may help accelerate AVS drug development and address health disparities in AVS treatment outcomes."

There is now mounting evidence that the CoREST complex plays oncogenic roles, although the contributions of its catalytic versus noncatalytic functions remain unclear. Here, we summarize and discuss mechanisms whereby the CoREST complex coopts tissue-specific transcription factors to elicit pathogenic activity in cancer and neurodegenerative disease. We also identify tumor types with selective dependencies on the scaffolding properties of the CoREST complex. We argue that these tumor types may benefit from a KBTBD4-activating/CoREST complex degrader therapy, which could also enhance antitumor immunity and sensitize resistant tumors to immunotherapy. Overall, understanding how the CoREST complex operates abnormally and differences between its targeting through catalytic inhibitors or protein degraders will help discern all possible applications for targeting therapies now in clinical development."
