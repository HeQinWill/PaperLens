While CDR seems promising, the associated uncertainties are not well known. One unexplored aspect is whether the uncertainties in CDR and transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) are coupled to any degree, e.g. some CDR methods could have lower carbon removal potential if TCRE are high. In this paper, we quantify the coupled uncertainties between TCRE and the CDR of ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) and reforestation. To do so, we used a perturbed parameter ensemble with the University of Victoria Earth system climate model. These results were fed to train Kernel Flows-based model emulators, which in turn were used, together with observational data, to carry out Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to characterize Bayesian posterior distributions. It turns out that OAE results in slow but steady CDR, with temperature reduction nearly linearly related to the amount of carbon removed. CDR with OAE is also only weakly dependent on uncertain climate system parameters and TCRE, indicating that OAE is a reliable CDR method with respect to the coupled uncertainties between its removal potential and TCRE. CDR of reforestation slows down after 50 years, and its temperature reduction from biogeochemical effects is offset by the warming biogeophysical effects, as reforesting pastures lowers albedo. Moreover, CDR by reforestation shows a strong dependency on uncertain climate system parameters and negatively correlates with TCRE, implying that it is less reliable as a CDR method. We argue that CDR potential, timescale of CDR, and uncertainty coupling between TCRE and CDR should all be considered when designing robust climate change mitigation portfolios."

Testing showed our approach works well to track how pollution spreads in urban areas. By combining observations with prior knowledge, we improved the accuracy of emission estimates. Applying this method in Paris, we found emissions were 9 % lower than expected and dropped significantly during COVID-19 lockdowns. Our method offers a reliable way to monitor pollution and support environmental policies. 
 We present a comprehensive quantification of daily NOx emissions from Paris using an inverse analysis of tropospheric NO2 columns measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over a 5-year period (May 2018–August 2023). Our analysis leverages a superposition column model that captures the relationship between the increase in NO2 with distance over an urban source region to underlying NOx emissions, accounting for chemical transformations and wind in the urban boundary layer. To evaluate the robustness of the superposition column model, we tested it against high-resolution (300 m) Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using MicroHH, a computational fluid dynamics model, with atmospheric chemistry, confirming that the model’s simplifying assumptions introduce uncertainties below 10 %. Building on this foundation, we develop a new Bayesian inversion method that incorporates prior knowledge on NOx emissions and lifetimes and accounts for model and prior uncertainties. Compared to a previous look-up table approach, which relied on least-squares minimization without prior constraints, the Bayesian method demonstrated superior performance. In controlled tests, it reproduced known NOx emissions within 5 %. Applying Bayesian inversion to TROPOMI data in Paris, we observed a significant reduction in NOx emissions from 44 mol s−1 in 2018 to 32 mol s−1 in 2023, representing a 27 % decrease. This decline exceeds the 12 % reduction predicted by the TNO-MACC-III bottom-up inventory, indicating limited accuracy of current inventories. Seasonal analysis revealed higher posterior emissions in winter, possibly highlighting the role of residential heating or vehicle cold starts, which may be underrepresented in bottom-up estimates. Our improved Bayesian framework delivers accurate NOx emission estimates that align well with independent data sets. This approach provides a valuable tool for monitoring urban NOx emissions and assessing the efficacy of air quality policies."

We report the results of the first study of the kinetic fractionations of Kr, Xe, and Ne in the stratosphere. It was suggested that changes in the stratospheric circulation during glacial and interglacial cycles may have affected the noble gas elemental ratios in ice core samples. 
 Gravitational separation of gas species in the stratosphere is caused mainly by molecular diffusion and is a powerful tool to diagnose stratospheric transport processes. Previous studies have shown that isotopic and elemental ratios of major atmospheric components decrease with increasing altitude in proportion to the differences of their mass numbers. However, there have been no reports of the vertical changes of Kr, Xe, and Ne in the stratosphere. Here we report the results of the first study of the vertical changes of Kr, Xe, and Ne in the stratosphere based on high-precision analyses. Our goal was to reveal the vertical distributions of noble gases and to clarify the mechanisms governing their separations.  Noble gases were measured for the stratospheric air collected by balloon-borne cryogenic air samplers over Japan. We found that the isotopic and elemental ratios of all noble gases decreased and increased with increasing altitude for heavy and light noble gases, respectively. Vertical distributions normalized for the mass number differences indicated that the larger the mass number, the smaller the separation of both the isotopic and elemental ratios. The implication was that kinetic fractionation occurred in the stratosphere because of the differences of molecular diffusivities. We performed model simulations and were able to reproduce the kinetic fractionations for heavier noble gases. Results of model simulations suggested that the kinetic fractionations of noble gases were usable as a new tool to diagnose stratospheric transport processes. In the modern atmosphere, it is difficult to detect the long-term change of the stratospheric circulation from noble gases, except for Ar/N2 ratio, in the troposphere. However, it was suggested that changes in the stratospheric circulation during glacial and interglacial cycles may have affected the noble gas elemental ratios in ice core samples."

By utilizing machine learning methods and remote sensing data from the past 25 years, the study identifies trends indicating a shortening of the CAO season. This has implications for the Arctic energy balance, underscoring the importance of further investigating these clouds to understand the trajectory of future Arctic climate. 
 Marine cold air outbreaks (CAOs) frequently occur in the Arctic when cold air moves over the relatively warm ocean, resulting in large turbulent fluxes, instability and cloud formation. Given the high frequency of CAOs during the Arctic winter, the associated clouds have a large impact on the region's radiative balance. Due to Arctic warming, the prevalence of CAOs and their clouds may change, impacting the Arctic radiative balance and potentially amplifying or mitigating local and global warming.To better understand how CAO clouds respond to Arctic warming, this study has developed a phenomenological CAO cloud classification tool that utilizes machine learning methods to identify closed and open cell clouds in CAOs from MODIS satellite imagery. This new approach achieves better performance in identifying CAO clouds compared to the marine cold air outbreak index calculated using MERRA-2 reanalysis, with accuracies of 85.4 % and 78.0 %, respectively. The new approach has revealed frequent CAO cloud formation in regions of high sea surface temperatures, with occurrence maxima along the Norwegian coast and the Northern Atlantic region south of Iceland. Furthermore, the approach reveals trends in CAO cloud cover that suggest a shortening of the CAO season, characterized by an approximate 10 %, increase in cloud coverage during winter and a nearly 20 % decrease during the shoulder months over the past 25 years. These trends suggest a positive radiative feedback during winter in response to climate change, underscoring the importance of further investigating these clouds to understand the trajectory of future Arctic climate."

This work examines how concentrations of these special and important particles change throughout the year at a measurement location in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. We find at this location, most of these special particles are associated with soil dusts in the air, and concentrations decrease in the winter. 
 Atmospheric ice-nucleating particles (INPs) significantly influence cloud microphysics and aerosol-cloud interactions. Understanding INPs in mountain regions is important for predicting impacts on regional clouds and precipitation. In this study, we conducted comprehensive measurements of immersion-freezing INPs at Mt. Crested Butte in the Rocky Mountains from September 2021 to June 2023 as part of the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL) campaign. The average number concentration of INPs active at −20 °C was 2 L−1, with distinct seasonal variation characterized by high summer concentrations and low winter concentrations. Aerosol sources were resolved, and INP concentrations were correlated with a coarse dust aerosol type, which dominates PM10 in this region. Calculating IN active surface site densities (ns) further supporting the primary contribution from coarse dust to INPs. Treatment with H2O2 indicated substantial contributions (91 % on average) from organic INPs across all activation temperatures, suggesting that supermicron organic-containing soil dust dominates the INPs in this region. Heat-labile INPs, likely biological in origin, were identified as dominant at >-15 °C through heat treatment of samples and showed significantly lower contributions in winter (∼ 96 % reduction). Parameterizations based on ns for the INPs observed in this mountainous region were developed, which effectively reproduced measured INP concentrations, particularly when accounting for seasonal differences. This study provides the first long-term, comprehensive characterization of INPs for the Upper Colorado River Basin region and offers a parameterization potentially useful for predicting INPs in other remote continental regions."

Enhanced atmospheric aging process contributes to high iron solubility in the upper mixing layer. Numerical models should consider vertical variations in iron dissolution to improve simulation accuracy. 
 Iron (Fe) plays a crucial role in the global biogeochemical cycle, marine ecosystems, and human health. Despite extensive research on Fe dissolution, the understanding of the mechanism of the Fe acidification process remains highly controversial. Here, we revealed significant differences in Fe acid dissolution between the upper mixing layer and the ground-level of a megacity. The results showed that air masses with elevated n[SO42-] / n[NO3-] ratios (5.4 ± 3.7) yielded more enhanced iron solubility (%FeS, 8.7 ± 2.4 %) in the upper mixing layer after atmospheric aging compared to those (1.6 ± 0.7 and 3.3 ± 0.4 %, respectively) at the ground-level near source regions of acidic gases. Further analysis suggested that Fe dissolution is primarily driven by sulfuric acid in the upper mixing layer different from nitric acid at the ground-level, attributing to the aging processes of acidic species during long-range transport. %FeS also exhibits a clear size dependence: sulfuric-acid dominates in submicron aerosols (Dp < 1 µm), leading to elevated %FeS (3.5 ± 3.9 %), whereas alkaline mineral dust in supermicron particles (Dp > 1 µm) neutralizes nitric acid and suppresses Fe dissolution (1.8 ± 2.2 %). This finding highlighted that sulfuric acid dominates Fe acidification process in the upper layer and submicron particles, but the contribution of nitric acid to Fe dissolution at the ground-level is equally important. Our study provides new data sets for testing atmospheric model's capability to simulate dissolved Fe concentration and deposition and will help to improve the accuracy of Fe solubility predictions."

The algorithms estimate layer identifiers such as (1) aerosol or cloud layers, (2) particle optical properties at 355 nm, (3) particle type identifiers, and (4) planetary boundary layer height. We demonstrated the algorithm performance using the simulated ATLID L1 data and found the algorithm’s capability to provide valuable insights into the global distribution of aerosols and clouds. 
 The Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) is a joint Japanese-European satellite observation mission for understanding the interaction between cloud, aerosol, and radiation processes and improving the accuracy of climate change predictions. The EarthCARE satellite was equipped with four sensors, a 355 nm high-spectral-resolution lidar with depolarization measurement capability (ATLID) as well as a cloud profiling radar, a multi-spectral imager, and a broadband radiometer, to observe the global distribution of clouds, aerosols, and radiation. In this study, we have developed algorithms to produce ATLID Level 2 aerosol products using ATLID Level 1 data. The algorithms estimated the following four products: (1) Layer identifiers such as aerosols, clouds, clear-skies, or surfaces were estimated by the combined use of vertically variable criteria and spatial continuity methods developed for the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) analysis. (2) Aerosol optical properties such as extinction coefficient, backscatter coefficient, depolarization ratio, and lidar ratio at 355 nm were optimized to ATLID L1 data by the method of maximum likelihood. (3) Six aerosol types, namely smoke, pollution, marine, pristine, dusty-mixture, and dust were identified based on a two-dimensional diagram of the lidar ratio and depolarization ratio at 355 nm developed by cluster-analysis using the AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) dataset with ground-based lidar data. (4) The planetary boundary layer height was determined using the improved wavelet covariance transform method for the ATLID analysis. The performance of various algorithms was evaluated using pseudo ATLID Level 1 data generated by Joint-Simulator (Joint Simulator for Satellite Sensors), which incorporates aerosol and cloud distributions simulated by numerical models. Results from applying the algorithms to the pseudo ATLID Level 1 data with realistic signal noise added for aerosol or cloud predominant cases revealed: (1) misidentification of aerosol and cloud layers was relatively low, approximately 10 %; (2) the retrieval errors of aerosol optical properties were 0.08×10-7±1.12×10-7m-1sr-1 (2±34 % in relative error) for backscatter coefficient and 0.01±0.07 (4±27 % in relative error) for depolarization ratio; (3) aerosol type classification was generally performed well. These results indicate that the algorithm's capability to provide valuable insights into the global distribution of aerosols and clouds, facilitating assessments of their climate impact through atmospheric radiation processes."

We developed a mid-cost sensor network for Munich, deployed on 17 rooftops. Temperature-stabilized enclosures and automated 2-point calibration ensured reliable performance, assessed by side-by-side comparison with a Picarro reference. In 1.5 years, the network collected 90 million measurements and resolved urban-rural gradients and seasonal diurnal patterns, capturing spatial CO2 variability at city scale. 
 Urban areas are major contributors to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, yet detailed monitoring remains a challenge due to the cost and operational constraints of traditional sensor networks. As a scalable alternative, we established the ACROPOLIS (Autonomous and Calibrated Rooftop Observatory for MetroPOLItan Sensing) network in the Munich metropolitan area, using mid-cost sensors to enable dense, city-scale observation. This work outlines the development of the hardware and software of the system, its performance and the first 1.5 years of operation, during which more than 90 million CO2 measurements were collected in urban, suburban and rural environments.The primary goal was to evaluate whether mid-cost Vaisala GMP343 sensors, when combined with manufacturer internal corrections and environmental stabilization, can reliably measure CO2 concentrations with sufficient accuracy to resolve urban gradients. We implemented a fully automated 2-point calibration procedure using synthetic dry reference gases and conducted a multi-week side-by-side comparison with a high-precision Picarro reference instrument to assess sensor performance.Our results show that, despite inter-sensor variability in temperature sensitivity, the hourly aggregated mean root mean square error (RMSE) of all sensors is 1.16 ppm with a range of 0.57 to 2.58 ppm. For the specific sensor housed in our second-generation enclosure with PID-controlled heating, the performance improved from 0.9 to 0.6 ppm RMSE. Analysis of spatial and temporal patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, urban–rural concentration gradients, and nighttime accumulation events, consistent with expected biogenic and anthropogenic activity, and atmospheric transport mechanisms.We conclude that mid-cost urban networks can provide scientifically valuable, spatially highly resolved greenhouse gas observations when supported by appropriate calibration and stabilization techniques. The open-source design and demonstrated performance of the ACROPOLIS network establish a blueprint for future deployments in other cities seeking to advance emissions monitoring and urban climate policy."

We reviewed the recent work and concluded three limitations: few open-source datasets, coarse building function categories, and poor model interpretability with inadequate multimodal feature fusion. Thus, we created BuildingSense with fine-grained categories and multimodal data, and proved that the large model can be used for improving the interpretability of results, with three directions for enhancing their performance. 
 Building function is a description of building usage. The accessibility of its information is essential for urban research, including urban morphology, urban environment, and human activity patterns. Existing building function classification methodologies face two major bottlenecks: (1) poor model interpretability and (2) inadequate multimodal feature fusion. Although large models with strong interpretability and efficient multimodal data fusion capabilities offer promising potential for addressing the bottlenecks, they remain limited in processing multimodal spatial datasets. Their performance in building function classification is therefore also unknown. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of multimodal building function classification datasets, which results in the challenge of effectively performing their performance evaluation. Meanwhile, prevailing building function categorization schemes remain coarse, which hinders their ability to support finer-grained urban research in the future. To bridge the gap, we constructed a novel multimodal and fine-grained dataset—BuildingSense—for building function classification. Based on BuildingSense, we evaluated the performance of four state-of-the-art large models from the perspective of classification outcomes and reasoning processes. The results demonstrate that large models can effectively comprehend multimodal spatial data, challenging the conventional concept. Based on that, three directions for future research can be key: (1) build a categorized inference example database, (2) develop cost-effective classification models, and (3) quantify the confidence of model outputs. Our findings not only provide insights into the development of subsequent large model-based classification methods but also contribute to the advancement of multimodal fusion-based classification methods.

The collection provides monthly estimates for major agricultural regions and helps describe how irrigation varies across locations, seasons, and years. It offers a foundation for improving how irrigation is quantified, compared across methods, and integrated into large-scale hydrological and climate studies. 
 Irrigation water use (IWU) is the largest direct human intervention in the terrestrial water cycle, yet it remains poorly characterized at the spatial and temporal scales required for climate research. We present a long-term archive of monthly IWU estimates at 0.25° spatial resolution for four major irrigated regions — the contiguous United States (CONUS), India, the Murray–Darling Basin in Australia, and the Ebro Basin in Spain — spanning up to two decades depending on input data availability. The datasets are derived using three distinct approaches: (i) a Soil Moisture (SM)–based Delta method that infers irrigation from discrepancies between satellite and model SM and evapotranspiration, (ii) an SM–based inversion of the soil water balance constrained by satellite SM, and (iii) a model–observation integration scheme combining a land surface model with satellite-based irrigated-area maps. Across regions, these approaches yield up to six SM-based Delta products, five SM-based Inversion products, and one Model–observation integration product. Validation against available irrigation records shows that several method–input combinations reproduce the order of magnitude of annual state-level irrigation volumes in the CONUS, with typical errors for the best-performing datasets of about 4–5 km3 yr−1 in root mean square deviation and 1–2 km3 yr−1 in bias. In the Murray–Darling and Ebro basins, the products capture the main features of the seasonal irrigation cycle, with variations in spatial patterns, magnitude, and timing across methods. In India, where no observational records are available, the datasets reproduce the expected agricultural seasons while exhibiting a wider inter-method spread. This coordinated dataset collection, produced with multiple Earth Observation-based approaches and harmonized inputs across regions, provides long-term, spatially explicit IWU estimates and a basis for better quantifying and representing irrigation in large-scale hydrological and climate studies.

BuRNN outperforms existing process-based fire models, which improves our capabilities of modelling past and future burned areas. 
 Fires play an important role in the Earth system but remain complex phenomena that are challenging to model numerically. Here, we present the first version of BuRNN, a data-driven model simulating burned area on a global 0.5° × 0.5° grid with a monthly time resolution. We trained Long Short-Term Memory networks to predict satellite-based burned area (GFED5) from a range of climatic, vegetation and socio-economic parameters. We employed a region-based cross-validation strategy to account for the high spatial autocorrelation in our data. BuRNN outperforms the process-based fire models participating in ISIMIP3a on a global scale across a wide range of metrics. Regionally, BuRNN outperforms almost all models across a set of benchmarking metrics in all regions. Through explainable AI we unravel the difference in regional drivers of burned area in our models, showing that the presence/absence of bare ground and C4 grasses along with the fire weather index have the largest effects on our predictions of burned area. Lastly, we used BuRNN to reconstruct global burned area for 1901–2019 and compare the simulations against independent long-term historical fire observation databases in five countries and the EU. Our approach highlights the potential of machine learning to improve burned area simulations and our understanding of past fire behaviour."

We tested each method using case studies and statistics of sea breeze occurrences, finding that a method that identifies atmospheric moisture fronts performs well. Some potential errors are demonstrated due to detection of other frontal systems, but this method could be useful for robustly analyzing sea breezes from models. 
 The sea breeze is a mesoscale atmospheric circulation that has implications for human activity and wind energy availability in coastal areas. Sea breezes have been studied in many regions throughout the world, with analyses usually identifying them at individual coastal sites based on local characteristics. Therefore, there is currently a lack of robust and generalizable identification methods, resulting in difficulties analyzing sea breeze characteristics over large regions. Here, software is developed that applies three, physically-based diagnostics for sea breeze identification to atmospheric model datasets. The diagnostics are tested across the coastline of Australia over a 6-month period. These diagnostics identify sea breezes based on either a front or circulation, with additional filtering applied to each diagnostic to reduce mis-classifications. The diagnostics are tested on four different model datasets, ranging from 2.2 km to around 25 km horizontal grid spacing, to explore the impact of spatial resolution on sea breeze identification methods. Based on a range of individual cases, as well as statistics of sea breeze occurrences, we suggest that a method based on moisture frontogenesis may potentially be suitable for sea breeze identification from model data. However, results for individual sea breeze cases indicate that there are difficulties associated with separating the sea breeze from other coastal fronts and circulations. These results have applications for quantifying the effect of sea breezes on human activities, such as for coastal wind energy and the modulation of the urban heat island."

The question of (unin)habitability in these locations is often simplified to characteristics of hazard exposure, reinforcing assumptions of inevitable mass migration. Here we use a multidimensional conceptualization of habitability, built from local knowledge, to simulate habitability trends in the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati over the coming century. Our use of system dynamics modeling offers a new approach to operationalizing habitability, allowing for the incorporation of a range of interdependent factors such as natural resource availability, livelihood opportunity, and population dynamics, among others. We find that water insecurity will be a driving factor in habitability loss, intensifying under extreme climate scenarios, while population pressures will further constrain resources. We show that regional disparities will lead to high internal migration rates, with movement to national urban centers preferred over movement abroad. Our work answers calls for a holistic and locally grounded understanding of habitability through a systems lens. By identifying how drivers of habitability change over time, we offer insights into targeted and timely climate adaptation."

Perfluoroalkane sulfonamide derivatives are a class of PFASs that have received attention due to their widespread use and environmental persistence. The goals of this research were to integrate studies of PFAS biotransformation pathways and biotransformation kinetics to discover dominant biotransformation pathways, enable quantitative estimates on the formation of rate-limiting intermediates, and simulate the net formation of key biotransformation products. We selected eight perfluoroalkane sulfonamide derivatives and performed aerobic batch experiments in bioreactors seeded with wastewater microbial communities. We identified 71 biotransformation products among the parent compounds, of which 42 represent unique chemical structures. We found that the biotransformation products could be assembled into convergent biotransformation pathways that generalize our understanding of the way perfluoroalkane sulfonamide derivatives are biotransformed. Our kinetics analyses reveal the dominant branches in the biotransformation pathways and allowed us to quantitatively estimate the extent of formation and biotransformation rate constant of key rate-limiting intermediates in the absence of authentic standards. Our results contribute to the ongoing discovery of biotransformation products for classes of PFASs and provide essential kinetics data to simulate the net formation of key biotransformation products."

In this study, subthreshold azoxystrobin exposure (1, 10, 100 μg/L, 4 days) caused no observable abnormalities in F0 embryos, whereas unexposed F1 and F2 generations exhibited developmental abnormalities, with effects independent of parental gender, demonstrating azoxystrobin exhibited transgenerational developmental toxicity at subthreshold exposure. Moreover, reduced protein levels of DNA methyltransferases and altered genomic DNA methylation patterns were detected in F1 and F2 embryos. Further research found that the ryr1b gene exhibited concurrent suppression of gene expression and DNA hypermethylation in F1 and F2 generations, with identical DNA methylation modification sites located in intron regions, indicating that the DNA hypermethylation of ryr1b was stably inherited transgenerationally and mediated epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Through constructing the interaction networks of differentially expressed genes with consistent expression trends across two generations, it was found ryr1b occupied the central position in the gene interaction network, and triggered cascade reactions through calcium signaling pathways. These pathways modulated excitation-contraction coupling (ECC)-associated gene expression in cardiomyocytes, ultimately driving cardiac functional deficits and developmental abnormalities in offspring embryos. This study provides critical insights into epigenetic mechanisms underlying pollutant-induced multigenerational toxicity."

Key,Biotransformation Processes Relevant to Geologic Carbon Sequestration: Potential Implications for Environmental Fate,"The nature and extent of microbial reactions in formations targeted for geologic carbon sequestration (GCS), as well as in nontarget formations that may be impacted by potential CO2 migration, are key to understanding the fate of injected CO2. The dissolution of CO2 into formation waters drives predictable geochemical changes, including pH reduction, shifts in redox conditions, and increased mineral solubility. These changes can alter microbial community composition (e.g., favoring acid-tolerant taxa) and stimulate microbes capable of using CO2 as a carbon source. Resulting biotransformation processes can transfer CO2 into the mineral phase (e.g., microbially facilitated carbonate precipitation), gas phase (e.g., methanogenesis), or organic phase (e.g., biomass formation). However, the extent, rate, and significance of these processes in both target and nontarget environments are not well understood. This paper reviews current knowledge of CO2 biotransformation relevant to GCS, including reactions occurring in deep storage formations and those arising from potential CO2 migration into shallow groundwater aquifers, the vadose zone, and marine environments. Additionally, factors that influence these transformations are summarized, methods for monitoring microbial processes are discussed, and key research gaps that could facilitate improved prediction of the long-term fate of CO2 under varying environmental conditions are identified."

Early high-level detections, from poorly selective high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC–FLD) methods, have never been repeated using modern, selective tandem mass spectrometry methods. We developed a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC–MS/MS) method for total BMAA analysis, using an improved solid-phase extraction sample cleanup to reduce suppression. We identified oxidative degradation products of BMAA, formed during strong acid hydrolysis, due to residual nitrate in culture media and implemented a dewatering step to resolve this problem. The method was validated using Spirulina powder, environmental, and two cultured cyanobacterial samples, achieving a reporting limit of 0.3 mg/kg in dry cyanobacterial samples. The validated method was then applied to an additional 30 cyanobacteria cultures from Aotearoa New Zealand. BMAA was only detected in one strain, Planktothrix sp. CAWBG-35, at 2.3 mg/kg. These results indicate that BMAA is not produced at the high levels originally reported (e.g., g/kg) in freshwater cyanobacteria and suggest that BMAA production is not widespread among freshwater cyanobacteria from Aotearoa New Zealand.

In a colloidal dispersed state, clays can increase the mean transport velocity of adsorbed pollutants by several orders of magnitude. Hence, delineated groundwater protection zones and riverbank filtration systems based on pollutant mobility may fail if carrier-facilitated transport is neglected. Yet, leveraging carrier-assisted transport for the controlled release of pollutants from soil may open new remediation opportunities. However, the determination and parametrization of competitive adsorption on mobile and immobile sorbents, crucial for carrier-facilitated transport, are often obscured by the interplay among numerous interaction processes in natural porous media. We present experiments in which montmorillonite minerals facilitated the transport of polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in a 10-fold increase in mean transport velocity in limestone media. PEG’s high affinity for montmorillonite enabled the mobilization of PEG already adsorbed at immobile interfaces. Additionally, model simulations suggested that high flow rates, for example, due to ponding infiltration, were favorable for carrier-facilitated transport, even for weak adsorption to mobile sorbents. We developed a sequential experimental protocol that permits identification of crucial factors controlling competitive sorption during carrier-facilitated transport."

This study investigated system dynamics, soil moisture, and redox potential (oxidation–reduction potential, ORP) in RTC and conventional biofilters (Non-RTC) under different antecedent dry weather periods (ADWP) to clarify mechanisms influencing TrOC removal. Mesocosm-scale vegetated columns operated for 1 year were sampled over 8 months under Non-RTC and three RTC configurations, with embedded sensors continuously monitoring moisture and the ORP in the unsubmerged and submerged zones. RTC-induced system operations significantly altered moisture and ORP conditions within the biofilters (p-value <0.001). RTC extended aerobic–anoxic conditions compared with predominantly anaerobic Non-RTC systems, significantly improving removal of TrOCs favoring aerobic biodegradation (p-value <0.001), with mean improvements of 37.2–45.5%. RTC accommodated ADWP-driven variability in system dynamics and treatment, except during 17-day ADWP when sustained anaerobic conditions in Non-RTC increased sulfamethoxazole and atrazine removal by up to 20.1%. Microbial profiling revealed modest increases in the diversity and abundance of TrOC-degrading genera under RTC (up to 4-fold). These findings demonstrate RTC’s potential to optimize TrOC removal via active control of system dynamics, supporting broader and more sustainable operation of stormwater biofilters."

This study combined in vivo exposure of male C57BL/6J mice (0, 4, 40, and 400 μg/L for 18 weeks) and in vitro assays in primary Leydig cells to demonstrate that 6:2 Cl-PFAES dose-dependently reduced sperm count and serum/testicular testosterone, accompanied by testicular interstitial vacuolation. Transcriptomics and metabolomics demonstrated the concurrent significant enrichment of autophagy pathways and disruption of lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, 6:2 Cl-PFAES suppressed expressions of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), ras-related GTP binding protein 7 (RAB7), and deacetylation of forkhead box class O1 (FOXO1), thereby impairing lipophagy flux and promoting lipid droplets accumulation. Molecular docking indicated comparable binding affinity of 6:2 Cl-PFAES and PFOS to SIRT1 (−10.4 kcal/mol), and further research demonstrated that 6:2 Cl-PFAES reduced the deacetylation activity of SIRT1. Crucially, Sirt1 overexpression in transgenic mice (Sirt1TG) or pharmacological activation of SIRT1 (SRT1720) and RAB7 (ML-098) rescued testosterone synthesis and restored lipophagy flux. This study identifies the SIRT1–FOXO1–RAB7 axis as a core target for 6:2 Cl-PFAES-induced suppression of testosterone biosynthesis via lipophagy dysregulation, providing critical molecular insights for assessing the reproductive risks of PFOS alternatives."

Here, we investigated the single-cell heterogeneity of labile Cu(I) metabolism in the model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using an image-enabled flow cytometer platform. Algal cells exposed to chronic Cu stress exhibited distinct labile Cu(I) bioaccumulation patterns, forming two subpopulations: “LCu(I) cells” and “HCu(I) cells,” differentiated by intracellular labile Cu(I) content. These results provide direct evidence of heterogeneous Cu(I) distribution at the single-cell level in microalgae. Higher Cu stress induced a shift from LCu(I) cells to HCu(I) cells, suggesting differential cellular sensitivity to Cu stress and varying labile Cu(I) accumulation. At the molecular level, multiomics analyses identified Ctr3p as a potential key regulator of labile Cu(I) homeostasis in algal cells. Confocal imaging revealed abnormal aggregation of glutathione (GSH) in granules within HCu(I) cells. Complementary GSEA results indicated an aberrant GSH compartmentalization in HCu(I) cells that might contribute to Cu(I) hyperaccumulation. At the physiological level, hyperaccumulated Cu(I) in HCu(I) cells likely caused cytotoxicity and photosynthesis inhibition. This study highlights the complexity and variability of labile Cu metabolism at the single-cell level, emphasizing the importance of accounting for subpopulation-specific responses in metal toxicity assessments, rather than relying solely on bulk-level analyses."

However, sources from end users─particularly household natural gas stoves─remain undercharacterized. To address this gap, we measured methane emissions from 62 household stoves in China. The average emission factor reached 0.20 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18, 0.22) kg of methane per stove per year, with 63% of emissions originating from incomplete combustion during stove operation. The measured emission rates during high-power use were positively correlated with both stove age and historical usage frequency. Nationally, household stoves are projected to emit 66 (95% CI: 59, 74) Gg of methane annually by 2025. The opening of the burner stove inlet valve (SIV) is the primary cause of methane emissions from stoves when they are turned off. Closing the SIV during inactive periods could lower emissions by one-third, avoiding up to 0.13 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.18) Tg of methane emissions between 2026 and 2030.

While TFA forms in the atmosphere and deposition is its primary loss process, the relative contributions of wet and dry deposition require observational constraints. Here, we present a record of TFA in total, wet, and dry deposition in Toronto, Canada, between 2018 and 2024. Samples were collected using custom-built total and automated wet deposition samplers. All total (n = 103) and wet (n = 98) deposition samples contained TFA, with concentrations ranging from 0.07–4.55 μg L–1 and 0.09–3.19 μg L–1, respectively. Seasonal variation showed fluxes peaking in summer months, consistent with atmospheric oxidation of precursors as a major source. Fluxes in 2020 were statistically lower than other years by a factor of 2–5, coinciding with reduced anthropogenic activity during COVID-19 lockdowns. This suggests that TFA sources in Toronto are mainly driven by short-lived precursors. The median dry deposition flux (106 μg m–2 a–1) accounted for 0–94% (median 37%) of the total TFA deposition, higher and more variable than model estimates. These results provide the first field-based quantification of TFA in dry deposition, demonstrating that it is a significant and previously underrepresented removal pathway."

To quantify the efficacy of natural ventilation configurations, we conducted approximately two months of continuous monitoring in a modern UK one-bedroom apartment, comparing three ventilation scenarios during cooking: fully opened (all windows and internal doors open), door-opened only (internal doors open but windows closed), and fully closed (all windows and internal doors closed). Air quality sensors were calibrated against a reference instrument (Fidas 200E) both before and after the field deployment. During the study period, outdoor PM2.5 mass concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 31.0 μg m–3, averaging 6.3 μg m–3. Indoor concentrations were substantially higher than average outdoor levels, with the fully opened scenario yielding the lowest exposure at 14.9 μg m–3 in the living room/kitchen and 15.4 μg m–3 in the bedroom. Relative to the fully opened scenario, PM2.5 concentrations increased by 58.4% (living room/kitchen) and 55.8% (bedroom) under door-opened only conditions, and under fully closed conditions by 28.9% and 27.9%, respectively.

Here, using a chemical transport model with modern and future emission scenarios, we investigate the critical loads of nitrogen deposition on the national park ecosystems in India, spanning alpine and subalpine forests, desert, mangroves, tropical and subtropical deciduous forests, and evergreen forests. We find that nearly 80% of all of the national parks experience nitrogen deposition exceeding the critical load. Future climate change projections simulated using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios indicate nitrogen deposition will increase further, with a median change of +17% to +30% across all ecosystems. This indicates an irreversible risk to native floral biodiversity, as ecosystems elsewhere have been unable to recover to native vegetation.

These impacts depend on BC concentration and mixing state with other aerosol components. However, in situ observations of BC over oceans remain scarce, and the influence of the marine environment on the evolution of BC mixing state is not well understood. Here, we present shipborne measurements aboard the research sailing yacht S/Y Eugen Seibold during 10 Atlantic Ocean cruises. The data set spans 1,120 of measurement hours from near‐coastal regions to remote ocean areas. In oceanic regions extending from tens to thousands of kilometers offshore, 1‐min averaged BC concentrations were typically around 100 ng m−3, suggesting a well‐mixed marine background. Despite the relatively small variability in BC mass concentrations, the mixing state of BC exhibits substantial differences between nearshore and remote oceanic regions. High number fractions (>50%) of BC particles without core‐shell morphologies, characterized by BC externally attached to non‐BC materials, were observed in near‐coastal regions and decreased to ∼20% in remote oceanic regions. In ship‐impacted regions, small freshly emitted BC particles tend to coagulate with other aerosol particles and forming non‐core‐shell attached structures, while high relative humidity (RH > 85%) tends to promote the formation of thick coatings. Our results provide new insights into climate‐relevant properties and underscore the importance of coagulation and hygroscopic processing for the mixing state of BC in the marine atmosphere."

While previous research has demonstrated the impacts of temperature on photosynthesis and BVOCs, the effects of humidity and the combined effects of temperature and humidity remain understudied. Here we discuss the discrete and synergistic impacts of temperature and humidity on ponderosa pine trees. We used a portable photosynthesis system coupled to a proton‐transfer‐reaction mass spectrometer to quantify leaf‐level changes in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and emissions as a function of both temperature and humidity. Results demonstrate that all BVOC emissions investigated increased with temperature, regardless of humidity, in agreement with literature. To our knowledge, we present the first direct observation of temperature‐dependent methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein emissions from ponderosa pines. We find that elevated humidity enhances the baseline emissions of many BVOCs. Increasing relative humidity from 30% to 50% resulted in basal emission rates increasing between 1.7‐fold for sesquiterpenes and 2.9‐fold for 2‐methyl‐3‐buten‐2‐ol. Our results may help explain field observations where BVOC emissions are decoupled from temperature under some conditions, and we clearly illustrate the need for further investigations on BVOC humidity sensitivity over larger (e.g., ecosystem) scales and on other plant species to improve chemical transport model predictions."

Exposure to PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is associated with adverse health effects including premature death and respiratory morbidity. Air quality modeling was performed to quantify seasonal wildfire‐PM2.5 exposure across Canada for 2019–2023, and the annual acute and chronic health impacts and economic valuation due to wildfire‐PM2.5 exposure were estimated. Exposure to wildfire‐PM2.5 varied geospatially and temporally. For 2019–2023, the annual premature deaths attributable to wildfire‐PM2.5 ranged from 49 (95% CI: 0–73) to 400 (95% CI: 0–590) due to acute exposure and 660 (95% CI: 340–980) to 5,400 (95% CI: 2,800–7,900) due to chronic exposure, along with numerous non‐fatal cardiorespiratory health outcomes. Per year, the economic valuation of the health burden ranged from $550M (95% CI: $19M–$1.2B) to $4.4B (95% CI: $150M–$9.9B) for acute impacts and $6.4B (95% CI: $2.2B–$12.9B) to $52B (95% CI: $18B–$100B) for chronic impacts. Additionally, a long‐term average annual exposure for 2013–2023 was estimated using air quality modeling. From this, more than 80% of the population had an average seasonal wildfire‐PM2.5 exposure of at least 1.0 μg/m3 and there were 1,900 (95% CI: 980–2,800) attributable premature deaths and a total economic valuation of $18B (95% CI: $6.1B–$36B), per year.

 Two decades of genetic studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have identified more than 100 genes harbouring rare risk mutations1–13. Despite this substantial heterogeneity, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses have identified convergent patterns of dysregulation across the ASD postmortem brain14,15–17. To identify shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD-linked mutations, we assembled a large patient collection of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells, consisting of 70 hiPS cell lines after stringent quality control representing 8 ASD-associated mutations, idiopathic ASD, and 20 lines from non-affected control individuals. Here we used these hiPS cell lines to generate human cortical organoids, profiling by RNA sequencing at four distinct time points up to 100 days after in vitro differentiation. Early time points harboured the largest mutation-specific changes, but different mutations converged on shared transcriptional changes as development progressed. We identified a shared RNA and protein interaction network, which was enriched in ASD risk genes and predicted to drive the observed downstream changes in gene expression. CRISPR–Cas9 screening of these candidate transcriptional regulators in induced human neural progenitors validated their downstream convergent molecular effects. These data illustrate how risk associated with genetically defined forms of ASD can propagate by means of transcriptional regulation to affect convergently dysregulated pathways, providing new insight into the convergent impact of ASD genetic risk on human neurodevelopment.

 The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) plays a central role in regulating the global ocean circulation, climate and Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamics. Yet the spatiotemporal variability of the ACC during the Pleistocene remains poorly constrained. Here we reconstruct ACC flow-speed variation using a meridional transect of sediment cores from the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Our results reveal zonally asymmetric changes in ACC strength across the Southern Ocean on orbital timescales over the past one million years; the ACC intensified in the South Indian Ocean but weakened in the South Pacific during glacial and low-obliquity periods, with the opposite pattern during interglacial and high-obliquity periods. These anti-phased changes probably reflect an integrated response to bathymetric constraints, shifts in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, sea-ice extent, buoyancy forcing and current confluence. Such zonally asymmetric and anti-phased ACC dynamics persisted during warmer-than-present intervals of the Pleistocene, offering a potential analogue for future anthropogenic warming—albeit under fundamentally different boundary conditions.

 Metallocene research has influenced the development of organometallic chemistry, and the metal–nonmetal inverted half-sandwich structure (inverse metallocene) was very recently discovered. However, additional instances are required to propose the concept inverse metallocene and it remains uncertain whether metal five-membered ring structures analogous to the cyclopentadienyl anion structure exist.

In particular, we report an average NIR-II photothermal conversion efficiency per metal atom of 14.7% and the stability of the five-membered Pd aromatic ring, as illustrated by the fact that Pd5–C maintained photothermy performance for >10 heating–cooling cycles even after the ligands were removed. We further demonstrate the great potential of inverse palladocenes in areas such as laser shielding, high-temperature degradation, ignition, and temperature/light control.

 The molecular underpinnings contributing to the onset of Barrett’s esophagus (BE) remain elusive. By studying familial clusters of the disease, here we identify a significant association between genetic variants in the V-set and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 10 Like (VSIG10L) gene and BE predisposition. Using mammalian tissues and patient-derived organoids, we show VSIG10L is selectively expressed in the suprabasal squamous cells of the esophageal mucosa and is essential for epithelial maturation and homeostasis. Mice carrying human-orthologous germline mutations in Vsig10l exhibit loss of desmosomes, concomitant with disrupted epithelial differentiation programs, in the squamous mucosa. Upon long-term exposure to a bile acid (deoxycholate) supplemented diet, Vsig10l-mutant mice develop overt BE-like lesions in the forestomach. Furthermore, loss of esophageal VSIG10L expression is observed frequently in patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, a known risk factor for BE. Collectively, our study uncovers a fundamental link between VSIG10L, esophageal homeostasis, and BE predisposition.

 Prior knowledge accelerates subsequent learning of similarly structured problems – a phenomenon termed learning to learn – by forming generalizable neural representations called neural correlates of schema (NCS). However, how the brain exploits stable NCS while remaining flexible towards changes (the stability-plasticity dilemma) remains unclear. Here, we show that the primate brain addresses this dilemma by representing the stable NCS and task-unique changes in a near-orthogonal manner. We analyzed neural activities in the dorsolateral premotor cortex of three male macaques trained to perform a series of visuomotor mapping tasks. By delineating decision and stimulus-related subspaces, we identified NCS within the decision subspace, whose reuse facilitated subsequent learning. In addition, the decision subspace exhibited a near-orthogonal relationship with the stimulus-related subspace, minimizing cross-domain interference. Our results reveal that restricting NCS to specific functional domains can preserve useful knowledge while maintaining near-orthogonality with other subspaces, enabling flexible adaptation to new environments, thereby resolving the stability-plasticity dilemma. This study reveals that during a series of learning tasks, the macaque brain represents the shared (e.g. the decision strategy) and task-unique information (e.g., sensory inputs) in a near-orthogonal manner, thereby supporting reuse of the shared component to facilitate learning, while remain flexible to changes in specifics."

 Photocatalytic hydrogen production faces barriers to industrialization, including inadequate light absorption and limited mass/momentum transfer at scale. Integrating external hydrocyclones into photoreactors is a promising solution, yet the multiscale complexity of hydrocyclone-driven hydrogen generation impedes mechanistic understanding and rational system design. Herein, we build a scalable hydrocyclone-based photoreactor that achieves 270 mL/h hydrogen yield and 5.26% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency under simulated sunlight, as 4.5 times higher than static conditions. We develop a hierarchical multiscale model combining computational fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and density functional theory, which connects macro-scale hydrocyclone flow strain to atomic-level photocatalytic processes. Here, we show that shear stress-induced nanoscale lattice restructuring of the catalyst modulates photoexcitation pathways, triggers a threshold-activated catalytic amplification effect, and identifies an optimal flow rate of 20-30 L/min. These findings reveal a multiscale force–chemical coupling mechanism linking reactor-scale hydrocyclone flow fields to lattice-scale strain-driven catalytic enhancement, guiding large-scale photocatalytic hydrogen production.

 Titanium carbide MXene (Ti₃C₂Tₓ) is an emerging metallic material with promise for (opto)electronics and thermal management. Yet how photoexcitation—particularly via photogenerated thermal energy—modifies its charge carrier dynamics remains poorly understood. By combining time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy and transient reflectance measurements, we reveal a long-lived, photo-induced suppression of conductivity, which we attribute to efficient lattice heating and slow heat dissipation in Ti₃C₂Tx. A systematic variation of pump photon energy reveals that this ‘negative’ photoconductivity can equivalently be induced by lattice temperature increases, indicating a thermal origin. Repetition-rate-dependent transient reflectance measurements further show residual heat persisting over 100 ns, substantially longer than in conventional metals. Our work presents a unified understanding of photothermal effects in Ti₃C₂Tₓ and their influence on non-equilibrium charge transport, underscoring its potential for photothermal electronics and light-to-thermal energy storage applications.

 As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely adopted, understanding how they learn from, and memorize, training data becomes crucial. Memorization in LLMs is widely assumed to only occur as a result of sequences being repeated in the training data. Instead, we show that LLMs memorize by assembling information from similar sequences, a phenomenon we call mosaic memory. We show major LLMs to exhibit mosaic memory, with fuzzy duplicates contributing to memorization as much as 0.8 of an exact duplicate and even heavily modified sequences contributing substantially to memorization. Despite models displaying significant reasoning capabilities, we somewhat surprisingly show memorization to be predominantly syntactic rather than semantic. We finally show fuzzy duplicates to be ubiquitous in real-world data, untouched by deduplication techniques. In this work, we show memorization to be a complex, mosaic process, with real-world implications for privacy, confidentiality, model utility and evaluation.

 The mechanisms driving oxygen isotope variations in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation (δ¹⁸Op) and their proxy archives remain controversial. Here, we use IsoGSM3—an isotope-enabled climate model with moisture-tagging capability and rigorously validated against observations, to show that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the primary mode of interannual δ¹⁸Op variability across East Asia. ENSO’s imprint arises primarily through its modulation of upstream deep convection and rainout, altering the isotopic signature of moisture transported downstream into East Asia. It further strengthens the imprint of low-level monsoon circulation variability on δ¹⁸Op, producing larger-amplitude and more spatially extensive anomalies over the EASM domain. An additional pathway involves ENSO’s influence on the subtropical westerly jet, with El Niño events accentuating its southward displacement during the late and post-monsoon seasons, leading to positive δ¹⁸Op anomalies over the EASM domain. Despite these coherent dynamical influences, the ENSO-driven leading mode of interannual δ¹⁸Op variability captures only ~21% of the total variance, a signal that, though clearly discernible in the model and observations, can be potentially obscured in archives that integrate δ¹⁸Op over multiple years, making seasonal or annually resolved records essential for capturing its variability."

 Efficient carbon dioxide mineralization in silicate-rich formations depends on reaction rates within fracture networks, yet the role of fracture microstructure remains poorly constrained. We investigated how fracture aperture and surface roughness influence mineralization by reacting synthetic forsteritic olivine fractures with controlled apertures (0.5–1.6 millimeters) and roughness (6–16 micrometers) with supercritical carbon dioxide at 13.7 megapascals and 185 degrees Celsius. Optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy showed that rougher fracture surfaces promoted iron oxide precipitation, which passivated olivine surfaces, limiting magnesium availability for carbonate formation while removing iron as a reactant. These effects were more pronounced in smaller-aperture fractures. A geochemical model incorporating surface topography and passivation reproduced the observed trends, confirming that increased roughness can reduce reactivity despite greater surface area. Our results demonstrate that fracture microstructure strongly influences iron oxide passivation and carbon dioxide mineralization, with important implications for predicting long-term performance of engineered carbon dioxide storage systems.  Rougher surfaces in smaller apertures olivine fractures increase reactive surface area but hinder efficient carbon dioxide mineralization by promoting passivating iron oxide precipitates, according to an integrated experimental and modeling study."

 Outcrops and cores are primary sources of information about the Earth’s past. Quantitative analyses rely on geochronologies that take into account highly variable sedimentation and erosion rates as well as gaps from missing strata. Using 23 geochronologies from the Holocene, Quaternary, Phanerozoic and Precambrian, we apply Haar fluctuation analysis to statistically characterize the number of measurements per unit time - the measurement densities. The analysis determines the densities’ (multifractal) scaling regimes and exponents; collectively, the analyses span over nine orders of magnitude in time scale. The measurement density is a new paleoindicator that we show is typically correlated with the primary paleoindicator, biasing and complicating its statistical interpretation. We also analyze the distribution of gaps linking the latter’s (probability) scaling with series incompleteness and the length Sadler effect.

 Detecting, locating, and characterising the dynamics of destabilised volcanic material is critical for assessing the extreme hazards posed by volcanic mass flows, such as pyroclastic density currents. Geophysical measurements of these events may offer information otherwise hardly observable at close range. Here we investigate pyroclastic density current dynamics using a multiparameter approach that combines seismic, distributed acoustic sensing, and infrasound data with thermal and visible imagery, supported by numerical simulations. We focus on two events at Stromboli volcano, Italy, that occurred in October and December 2022. By comparing visible imagery with seismic energy and applying array processing techniques, we identify different flow volumes ( ~23.5 ± 9.5 × 103 m3 and  ~80 ± 9 × 103 m3, respectively) and velocities (33-42 m/s and 54-59 m/s, respectively). Simulations reveal that reproducing these velocities requires volume-dependent empirical friction angles ( ~27° and 21°), consistent with dry granular flow behaviour and friction weakening. These findings offer new insights into the use of distributed acoustic sensing for volcanic monitoring and underscore the value of integrating multiparameter data with modeling to better understand complex volcanic processes.

 The ‘Strangelove ocean’ (a state of ocean, almost devoid of living organisms) documented in the early Cambrian strata in South China, has been thought to be driven by an extraterrestrial impact, but this viewpoint has been doubted for emerging geochemical evidence. Volcanism may be a trigger for the oceanic crisis. However, such a linkage has not yet been established. Here, we conduct an investigation into the timing and origin of the early Cambrian K-bentonites (a type of clay rock formed from volcanic ash) of the Yangtze and Baoshan blocks. The results suggest that the K-bentonites may represent early Cambrian explosive super-eruptions occurred in the north-western margin of Gondwana. The eruptions might trigger the anoxia of the contemporaneous ocean and coincided temporally with a bio-crisis preceding the summit of the Cambrian explosion. We propose that they may have initiated the ‘Strangelove ocean’ and delayed the climax of the Cambrian bio-radiation.

 The dual-scale agricultural management, namely farmland-scale management and service-scale management, offers a solution for achieving a balance between ensuring food security and reducing carbon emissions. Based on panel data of 30 Chinese provinces between 2005 and 2021, we use two-way fixed effects model and mediating effect model to explore the impact of dual-scale agricultural managements on agricultural carbon emission intensity. It was found that: Dual-scale agricultural managements have a significant negative correlation with agricultural carbon emission intensity; They have a synergistic effect on reducing carbon emission intensity through industrial agglomeration effect, technological progress effect, and machinery service effect; Farmland-scale management correlate more significantly with reduced agricultural carbon emission intensity in regions with balanced food production and sales, regions with high degree of agricultural mechanization, and the eastern regions, while service-scale management correlate more significantly in the main food sales regions, high degree of agricultural mechanization regions and the central regions.

Statistical analyses and climate simulations indicate that these compound extremes are projected to intensify under future climate scenarios. 
 Extreme climate events (ECEs) pose substantial threats to global food security, particularly impacting winter wheat yields in Northern China. Here, we examine historical and projected effects of ECEs on wheat production across three sub-regions. Using statistical models and cropping system simulations, we quantify yield losses driven by individual and compound stressors under historical and future climate scenarios. Historically, post-anthesis compound hot-dry events and spring heat stress caused the greatest yield reductions in the north and middle sub-regions, whereas compound freeze-dry events dominated in the south. By 2080-2100, rising post-anthesis compound hot-dry events are projected to further reduce yields. Heat stress is expected to offset the benefits of reduced freeze stress, particularly in the cooler north sub-region, where its effects are more pronounced than in the warmer south. These findings highlight the urgent need for region-specific adaptation strategies to sustain wheat production under climate change. Compound freeze-dry events have been the primary drivers of historical yield loss in the south of Northern China, whereas compound hot-dry events  have dominated in other regions.

 Compound hazards, like simultaneous occurrence of unusually dry and hot (DH) weather, cause cascading socio-economic damages that surpass univariate hazards. In the context of agricultural production, DH events triggered by pressure and moisture flux anomalies are responsible for some of the most severe agricultural losses across the globe. Most analyses focus on characterizing compound events in individual regions, and the extent of spatial synchrony of DH events and their impacts on crop production has yet to be quantified. Here, using observation-based gridded precipitation and temperature data, we find that the frequency of widespread spatial synchrony–defined as five or more regions simultaneously experiencing DH events–has increased nearly ten-fold over the past four decades, while confined events are declining. This rapid synchronization, especially in recent decades, reflects a non-linear response to global warming. At global scale, substantially larger productivity losses are observed during widespread DH events as compared to the spatially confined DH events. Wheat cropland exhibits the strongest losses during synchronized DH events, followed by maize, with weaker effects for rice. The results highlight the importance of considering the growing occurrence of spatially widespread DH events in assessments of agricultural risk, alongside analyses of individual regional extremes.

 The Sentinel-1 satellite mission has been key to the achievement of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-based displacement rates that approach mm/yr precision, particularly in regions without significant vegetation and where long time series of observations exist. However, for more subtle displacement signals, separating the effects of surface processes from deformation due to deeper sources is still challenging. Here, we present a new method based on combinations of co-polarized (VV) and cross-polarized (VH) InSAR data. Cross-polarized data is typically noisier than the co-polarized data and are not widely used for InSAR. However, comparisons of co- and cross-polarized phase data can allow separation of the contributions from different processes. Signals due to deeper sources, such as slip along faults, should appear the same in both data types, while differences can be due to changes in surface characteristics. We examine full-resolution, unfiltered, VV and VH Sentinel-1 data covering Death Valley, California between January 2017 and March 2025. We find that displacement rates derived from VV and VH data differ by several mm/yr in some areas. We also show that rates based only on the VV imagery differ by a few mm/yr between subsets of pixels where the VV-VH differences are large or small, suggesting that VV-VH combinations can help researchers reliably identify pixels that are the least impacted by surface processes. While our work focuses on Death Valley, similar mm/yr-scale biases could impact endorheic basins around the world and influence analyses of interseismic motion, hazard estimates, and groundwater studies."

 This paper presents a novel algorithm for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry and closure phases. The proposed method efficiently processes long SAR time series with minimal computational cost, generating a soil moisture measurement for each acquisition.Soil moisture data were derived from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and validated across seven different test sites. Retrieval results were compared with modeled soil moisture data from land surface models, alternative remote-sensing products, and in situ measurements.The algorithm demonstrates strong correlations with modeled soil moisture, particularly in areas characterized by high interferometric coherence. However, performance was expectedly limited in regions with low interferometric coherence due to factors such as vegetation cover or snow cover.Looking ahead, this study identifies some relevant directions for future research, including the integration of backscatter information alongside phase data and the adaptation of the algorithm for SAR missions operating at different frequencies (e.g., L-band) or with very dense acquisition schedules (e.g., geosynchronous platforms). These advancements would further enhance the applicability and accuracy of soil moisture retrieval using SAR-based techniques."

 Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical determinant of wildfire ignition and spread. Accurate forecasting of LFMC dynamics, particularly at a two-week timescale, is essential for early wildfire danger assessment. While satellite remote sensing provides valuable current and historical observations, it lacks the ability to predict future LFMC dynamics. Meanwhile, although weather forecasts are relatively reliable over short timescales (up to two weeks), LFMC models based solely on meteorological inputs often fall short, particularly when predicting conditions at the species level. To address these limitations, this study introduces a species-specific approach that integrates MODIS-derived LFMC data into the biophysical process-based MEDFATE model to optimize LFMC simulations and enable short-term forecasting based on daily weather projections. A global sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify key input parameters for different tree species within MEDFATE. These parameters guided the development of a cost function that quantifies discrepancies between model-simulated and field-measured LFMC, enabling species-specific model calibration. To enhance model optimization, the global optimal DEoptim algorithm was combined with four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) to integrate MODIS-derived LFMC estimates into MEDFATE. Using weather projections, the optimized MEDFATE model produced LFMC forecasts at about a two-week timescale. Time-series measurements of LFMC dynamics for Quercus faginea, Quercus ilex, and Pinus halepensis in Spain, Pinus ponderosa in the USA, and Eucalyptus species in Australia demonstrated that model calibration improved daily LFMC estimates (R2 increased from 0.22 to 0.31; RMSE reduced from 18.71% to 16.04%). Further incorporation of MODIS-derived LFMC data significantly enhanced accuracy (R2 = 0.56; RMSE = 9.75%). Validation across seven wildfire events in Spain, Australia, and the USA confirmed the effectiveness and operational relevance of the approach for early fire warning. These findings underscore the potential of integrating satellite remote sensing and meteorological data into biophysical process-based models to improve tree species-specific LFMC prediction and support proactive fire management."

 Cloud cover in optical remote sensing imagery severely limits its effectiveness for downstream applications. Compared with cloud removal methods that rely on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data or single cloud‐free references, multi-temporal imagery provides richer, more stable and more reliable auxiliary information. However, existing methods often exploit only limited temporal observations and fail to fully capture the deep synergistic relationships among spatial, spectral, and temporal features, leading to reconstruction results that suffer from detail loss and spectral distortion in cloud-contaminated regions. To address this issue, we propose TSSMamba, a temporal–spectral–spatial state space model for multi-temporal cloud removal. The framework jointly models temporal dynamics, spectral responses and spatial structures of cloud-obscured imagery. A dual-stream architecture is designed to separately learn temporal–spectral and temporal–spatial dependencies, while a cross-dimensional fusion module strengthens interactions between the two streams and improves spatial coherence and spectral consistency in the restored images. Experiments on three public cloud removal datasets demonstrate that TSSMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

 Gas flaring (GF) releases large amounts of greenhouse gases and pollutants, severely affecting global climate change and regional environmental quality. Quantifying global GF activities is essential to implement emission mitigation polices. Existing methods struggle with detecting weak GF activities under complex daytime background conditions. This study proposes a method combining the spectral index and machine learning methods, to detect onshore GF sites (GFs) using the images from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 satellites. First, the Thermal Anomaly Index (TAI, calculated in the near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands) and TAI increment (ΔTAI) are applied to detect thermal anomalies from MSI images, in which ΔTAI enhances the spatial-contextual background contrast. Then, nine flare-specific features are selected to further identify the GFs from the thermal anomalies using a random forest model. Finally, the detected GFs were validated worldwide, achieving an overall user accuracy of 93.34% and a producer accuracy of 95.31%. This approach enhances the sensitivity to weak flares and effectively addresses the interferences from other heat sources and highly reflective buildings, providing a universal solution for GFs detection in complex onshore scenes."

 Methoxyphenols, as emitted abundantly from biomass burning, are important precursors of brown carbon (BrC) in the atmosphere. However, the effects of environmental factors on their gas-phase oxidation by nitrate radicals (NO3), the dominant nighttime oxidant, remain poorly understood. In this study, the reaction of vanillin, a proxy for methoxyphenols, with NO3 was investigated in a smog chamber under six environmental conditions, varied by pre-existing seed particles levels and relative humidity (RH). The NO3-driven oxidation under different environmental conditions consistently produced secondary BrC, with nitrogen-containing species identified as the dominant reaction products. Both seed level and RH were found to be critical environmental controls; higher seed concentrations promoted secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and increased mass absorption coefficient (MAC) under dry conditions but suppressed them under humid conditions. Furthermore, variations in seed concentration and RH guided the reaction pathways to distinct product distributions. Our findings also revealed that humid conditions may enhance the concentration of low-molecular-weight species regardless of seed levels. Overall, this work reveals how environmental conditions modulate secondary BrC formation from methoxyphenols oxidation with NO3, providing critical constraints for atmospheric models of aerosol optical properties."

 Understanding the impact of aerosols on heavy precipitation is crucial for improving predictions and management of atmospheric processes. Heavy convective precipitation often occurs within a few hours, making the investigation of aerosol influences on daily precipitation variability particularly important. In this study, heavy rainfall events in southwestern Iran were identified using ERA5 data alongside aerosol measurements from two satellite sources and the EAC4 reanalysis dataset. These datasets enabled analysis of aerosol optical depth (AOD), differentiation of aerosol types, and assessment of additional aerosol-related indices in the region. Two indices were used to classify clean and polluted conditions at macro- and micro-scales: AOD as a large-scale indicator, and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) as a small-scale indicator. The 25th and 75th percentiles of these indices over all rainy days were used as thresholds for clean and polluted conditions. Four aerosol types common in southwestern Iran were examined: black carbon (BC) and dust as radiatively absorbing aerosols, and sulfate and sea salt as non-absorbing aerosols. Analysis revealed three key features of daily heavy precipitation variability associated with aerosol types. Under polluted conditions defined by AOD, precipitation onset and peak occurred earlier, but event duration was shorter. In contrast, under polluted conditions defined by CDNC, precipitation started earlier but peaked later, with a longer duration. Furthermore, absorbing aerosols were associated with earlier onset and delayed peaks, whereas non-absorbing aerosols corresponded to delayed onset and extended precipitation duration. These findings highlight the distinct roles of aerosol types in modulating heavy rainfall characteristics."

 Under the trend of global warming, the Arctic region has experienced increasing warming and accelerating melting of sea ice, resulting in the opening of Arctic shipping routes with significant navigational potential. However, intense water vapor releases and a cold underlying surface can lead to frequent occurrences of sea fog and low clouds over the Arctic ice surfaces. Conducting detection of sea fog and low clouds is therefore highly important for ensuring the safety of Arctic shipping routes. In this study, a satellite detection algorithm for summer daytime sea fog and low clouds in ice floe fields of the Arctic has been proposed using the time series remote sensing data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the AdaBoost method. Methodologically, three spectral indices, the normalized difference sea-water index (NDSWI), the sea-ice recognition index (SIRI), and the mid-high-cloud recognition index (MHCRI), are first constructed by analyzing the variations in reflection spectra for sea fog and low clouds, sea ice, sea water, and mid-high clouds. Additionally, three texture features, namely, the homogeneity, contrast, and entropy, of the brightness temperature at 11.030 μm (BT11.030 μm) are calculated using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Subsequently, a strong learner classification model of the AdaBoost ensemble learning algorithm was built by adopting the samples of the spectral indices and texture features above and the weak learner of the decision. Finally, the residual mid-high clouds are removed through the threshold at BT11.030 μm. Verification indicated that the probability of detection (POD), false alarm rate (FAR), and critical success index (CSI) values were 84.44%, 9.45%, and 77.52%, respectively. This research supports the accurate detection of sea fog and low clouds in the Arctic, thereby ensuring safe navigation of Arctic shipping routes."

We present a high-resolution geodetic velocity field of the Tibetan Plateau, which shows that a few major strike-slip fault systems separate regions of more uniformly distributed deformation. We suggest that focused strain on major fault systems is enabled by relatively low-viscosity ductile shear zones extending through the lithosphere beneath the seismically active fault planes. Simple model calculations show that high slip rates on the Kunlun Fault enable east-west extension to be distributed broadly across the relatively weak southern and central Tibetan Plateau. Activation of the Kunlun fault in the Miocene at the same time as the onset of rifting in the north-south grabens suggests a causal relationship."

In skeletal muscle, this decline is largely driven by impaired function of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to efficiently contribute to muscle regeneration. We uncovered a cause of this aging-associated dysfunction: a cellular survivorship bias that prioritizes stem cell persistence at the expense of functionality. With age, MuSCs increased expression of a tumor suppressor, N-myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), which, by suppressing the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, increased their long-term survival potential but at the cost of their ability to promptly activate and contribute to muscle regeneration. This delayed muscle regeneration with age may result from a trade-off that favors long-term stem cell survival over immediate regenerative capacity."

We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing life span and that shoot apical meristems are protected from these epigenetic changes. We demonstrate that a program of transcriptional repression suppresses DNA methylation maintenance pathways during aging and that mutants of this program display a complete absence of epigenetic decay while physical aging remains unaffected."

In this work, we performed in situ imaging of the stripes and directly observed both superfluid and crystal excitations. We investigated superfluid hydrodynamics and revealed a stripe compression mode, thus demonstrating that the system possesses a compressible crystalline structure. Through the frequency softening of this mode, we located the supersolid transition point.

We hypothesize that soil physical constraints drive convergence in the operational range of leaf vascular tension. Based on a meta analysis of 19 diverse species, we find that stomatal regulation of transpiration is activated when leaf vascular tension reaches a narrow target of 1.3 ± 0.6 megapascals. This value matches the range (1.4 ± 0.6 megapascals) predicted from an optimal soil water extraction model. Optimality in plant vascular tension appears to have evolved by selection for a narrow range of osmotic pressure in the leaves of diverse species growing across variable environments."

We show how the social context emerges as a key driver of foraging dynamics. Foragers adaptively rely on social information to locate resources when unsuccessful and extend giving-up times in the presence of others, which results in increased area-restricted search at high social densities. These findings demonstrate the importance of sociality for human foraging decisions and provide a template for harnessing high-resolution tracking data to study real-world cognition."

Leguizamon,Lithographic crystallinity regulation in additive fabrication of thermoplastics (CRAFT),"For semicrystalline polyolefin thermoplastics, the balance between interconnected ordered crystalline and disordered amorphous regions is paramount to their performance and processability. However, contemporary manufacturing strategies, from injection molding to three-dimensional (3D) printing, result in monolithic objects, unable to spatially encode crystallinity. We develop a light-based approach for fabricating mechanically robust polyolefin thermoplastics with microscopic control over crystallinity in 3D space. Light dosage governs polymer stereochemistry giving access to a continuum of materials, from strong rigid plastics, such as high-density polyethylene, to more extensible materials akin to low-density polyethylene, all at the flick of a switch. Leveraging this finding in lithographic grayscale 3D printing enables rapid multimaterial fabrication with voxel-level control over optical and mechanical properties, opening avenues in information storage, soft robotics, and energy damping."

Metal-organic (MO) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers promise for scalable growth, but the reactions are kinetically limited, leading to nanometer-scale domain size and carbon contaminations. Here, we unveil the fundamental kinetic limitations and overcome them by introducing oxygen-assisted MOCVD (oxy-MOCVD) technology. By tuning reactions with oxygen, MO precursors are converted into high-purity transition-metal oxides and chalcogens, producing aligned molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) domains with a size and growth rate that are orders of magnitude larger than conventional MOCVD. The MoS2is free of carbon impurities and exhibits average mobility exceeding 100 square centimeters per volt per second. The scalability of oxy-MOCVD is demonstrated by 150-millimeter single-crystal MoS2wafers, proving the feasibility of industrial-scale production."

Although the spatial compartmentalization of metabolic functions is critical for proper liver function, it is unknown whether cancers arise from some zones but not others and whether there are metabolic determinants of cancer risk. Zone-specific, mosaic introduction ofCtnnb1(catenin beta 1) andArid2(AT-rich interaction domain 2) mutations, commonly co-mutated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in mouse models showed that position and metabolic context determine clone fates.Ctnnb1/Arid2-driven cancers were much more likely to arise in zone 3. The zone 3 genesGstm2andGstm3were required for efficient HCC initiation, in part through inhibition of ferroptosis. In the liver, the zonal determinants of HCC development can reveal metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer."

Joo;S. Deindl,From sequence to function: Bridging single-molecule kinetics and molecular diversity,"Biological function is fundamentally determined by nucleic acid and protein sequence. Beyond encoding genetic information, nucleic acids also display complex physicochemical parameters that shape structure, dynamics, and interactions. Understanding how sequence variation sculpts the energetic landscapes underlying these properties requires methods that capture both molecular diversity and dynamic behavior. Single-molecule techniques are ideally suited to this task, but conventional formats remain time and cost intensive. Recent breakthroughs have enabled highly multiplexed approaches for observing molecular dynamics across millions of individual molecules representing thousands of sequences or barcoded entities. Though still in development, these methods have begun to bridge sequence, structure, dynamics, and function at scale, opening new opportunities in drug discovery, molecular diagnostics, and functional genomics."
