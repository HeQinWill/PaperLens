10.1021/acs.est.4c01817,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究的是植物病原菌铜绿假单胞菌（Pseudomonas syringae）气溶胶的吸湿性，以及其在相对湿度变化下的吸水和脱水行为。研究使用差分迁移率分析仪测量了该细菌气溶胶在不同相对湿度下的生长因子，并比较了纯菌体和含有氯化钠的菌体的吸湿性差异。研究发现，与氯化钠相关的菌体表现出更强的吸湿性，这主要归因于氯化钠的存在。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，因为它主要关注的是微生物气溶胶的物理特性，而不是大气成分的整体遥感监测。虽然研究结果可能有助于理解生物气溶胶对云形成的影响，但这与利用卫星或传感器进行大气成分分析的遥感技术关联性较弱。,"['aerosol', 'cloud formation', 'biological aerosol particles', 'hygroscopicity', 'plant pathogen', 'Pseudomonas syringae']",Lærke Sloth Nielsen;Tina Šantl-Temkiv;María Palomeque Sánchez;Andreas Massling;Josephine Caroline Ward;Pia Bomholt Jensen;Thomas Boesen;Markus Petters;Kai Finster;Merete Bilde;Bernadette Rosati,Water Uptake of Airborne Cells of P. syringae Measured with a Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer,"Airborne microorganisms impact cloud formation and are involved in disease spreading. The ability of airborne cells to survive and express genes may be limited by reduced water availability in the atmosphere and depend on the ability of the cells to attract water vapor at subsaturated conditions, i.e., their hygroscopicity. We assessed hygroscopic properties of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, known to participate in cloud formation. We used a hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer to examine both hydration and dehydration behavior in the relative humidity (RH) range 5–90%. The cells were aerosolized either from Milli-Q water or from a 35 g L–1 NaCl solution, resulting in pure cells or cells associated with NaCl. Pure cells exhibited no deliquescence/efflorescence and a small gradual water uptake reaching a maximum growth factor (GF) of 1.09 ± 0.01 at 90% RH. For cells associated with NaCl, we observed deliquescence and a much larger maximum GF of 1.74 ± 0.03 at 90% RH. Deliquescence RH was comparable to that of pure NaCl, highlighting the major role of the salt associated with the cells. It remains to be investigated how the observed hygroscopic properties relate to survival, metabolic, and ice-nucleation activities of airborne P. syringae."
10.1021/acs.est.4c08704,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文主要研究的是利用单原子铜催化剂增强电芬顿降解有机污染物的技术。研究人员通过掺杂缺电子的硼来调节单原子铜催化剂的电子结构，提高了其对氧气的吸附能力，并显著增强了单线态氧的生成选择性。实验结果表明，该催化剂对苯酚、磺胺甲恶唑和双酚A等有机污染物具有高效的电芬顿降解效果，并且在不同阴离子和较宽的pH范围内均表现出良好的稳定性。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。,[],Genwang Zhu;Xinfei Fan;Yueling Yu;Yanming Liu;Xie Quan,Regulating the Electronic Structure of Cu Single-Atom Catalysts toward Enhanced Electro-Fenton Degradation of Organic Contaminants via 1O2 and •OH,"Heterogeneous electro-Fenton degradation with 1O2 and •OH generated from O2 reduction is cost-effective for the removal of refractory organic pollutants from wastewater. As 1O2 is more tolerant to background constituents such as salt ions and a high pH value than •OH, tuning the production of 1O2 and •OH is important for efficient electro-Fenton degradation. However, it remains a great challenge to selectively produce 1O2 and improve the species yield. Herein, the electronic structure of atomically dispersed Cu–N4 sites was regulated by doping electron-deficient B into porous hollow carbon microspheres (CuBN-HCMs), which improved *O2 adsorption and significantly enhanced 1O2 selectivity in electro-Fenton degradation. Its 1O2 yield was 2.3 times higher than that of a Cu single-atom catalyst without B doping. Meanwhile, •OH was simultaneously generated as a minor species. The CuBN-HCMs were efficient for the electro-Fenton degradation of phenol, sulfamethoxazole, and bisphenol A with a high mineralization efficiency. Its kinetic constants showed insignificant changes under various anions and a wide pH range of 1–9. More importantly, it was energy-efficient for treating actual coking wastewater with a low energy consumption of 19.0 kWh kgCOD–1. The superior performance of the CuBN-HCMs was contributed from 1O2 and •OH and its high 1O2 selectivity."
10.1029/2024GL111025,False,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是欧洲地区冷锋造成的极端降水事件。研究使用ERA5再分析数据，通过识别冷锋并分析其相关条件，运用分位数回归模型等方法，探讨了不同尺度下影响冷锋极端降水的驱动因素，包括湿度、辐合、低空急流速度等，并分析了有利于极端降水事件发生的天气形势。其重点在于改进对冷锋过程和极端降水的理解，并为气候模式中冷锋动力学的过程评估提供基础。研究中使用了再分析数据，而非直接的遥感观测数据，因此与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析）的相关性较弱。,"['precipitation', 'cold front', 'ERA5 data', 'synoptic conditions', 'meso-scale structure', 'quantile regression', 'climate models']",Armin Schaffer;Tobias Lichtenegger;Heimo Truhetz;Albert Ossó;Oscar Martínez‐Alvarado;Douglas Maraun,Drivers of Cold Frontal Hourly Extreme Precipitation: A Climatological Study Over Europe,"
In the mid‐latitudes extreme precipitation events are strongly associated with cold fronts. By exploring drivers across different scales and relating them to precipitation, we aim to improve our understanding of processes influencing cold frontal extremes. Using hourly ERA5 data over Europe and the North Atlantic, cold fronts are detected and the associated conditions are identified. Quantile regression models are employed to find drivers of frontal precipitation and to quantify these relations. Additionally, we use composites to study the synoptic conditions and meso‐scale structure of extreme events. We find that humidity close to the detected fronts, convergence and the low level jet speed contribute most to the formation of extreme precipitation. Synoptic conditions favoring the formation of extreme events are also identified. These results improve our understanding of cold frontal processes leading to precipitation. Additionally, they provide the foundation for a process‐based evaluation of frontal dynamics in climate models."
10.1029/2024GL110525,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了低云反馈对气候变化预测的影响。研究者通过基于岭回归的控制因子分析方法，利用观测数据约束了低云反馈。结果表明，全球低云反馈为中等正值，大约是耦合模式比较计划中16个模型平均值的2倍。这种差异与模型普遍存在的平均状态偏差有关：模型低估了低云对变暖的响应，因为它们系统性地低估了现今热带海洋低云量，并且低云对变暖的敏感性与现今低云量成正比。该研究强调了减少模型在云的平均状态及其对环境因素敏感性方面的偏差，对准确预测气候变化的重要性。 这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为研究使用了观测数据来约束气候模型，这很可能包括卫星观测等遥感数据。,"['low cloud feedback', 'climate change', 'satellite observations', 'climate models', 'cloud amount', 'remote sensing', 'atmospheric composition', 'warming']",P. Ceppi;T. A. Myers;P. Nowack;C. J. Wall;M. D. Zelinka,Implications of a Pervasive Climate Model Bias for Low‐Cloud Feedback,"How low clouds respond to warming constitutes a key uncertainty for climate projections. Here we observationally constrain low‐cloud feedback through a controlling factor analysis based on ridge regression. We find a moderately positive global low‐cloud feedback (0.45 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ K−1 ${\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$, 90% range 0.18–0.72 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ K−1 ${\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$), about twice the mean value (0.22 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ K−1 ${\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$) of 16 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We link this discrepancy to a pervasive model mean‐state bias: models underestimate the low‐cloud response to warming because (a) they systematically underestimate present‐day tropical marine low‐cloud amount, and (b) the low‐cloud sensitivity to warming is proportional to this present‐day low‐cloud amount. Our results hence highlight the importance of reducing model biases in both the mean state of clouds and their sensitivity to environmental factors for accurate climate change projections."
10.1029/2024GL110325,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了温度、海冰覆盖率以及海盐和尘埃气溶胶混合比对北极和南大洋云相的综合影响。它使用了CloudSat/CALIPSO卫星观测数据以及可解释机器学习技术，分析了不同高度云（低云、中云和中低云）的相态。研究发现云顶温度是决定云相的最重要参数，海盐和海冰对低云相态有预测能力，而尘埃对中云相态有预测能力。南大洋强烈的纬向风影响气溶胶分布，可能导致低层海盐气溶胶混合比高，但抑制了尘埃向极地的输送。海冰可能抑制海盐和海洋有机气溶胶的释放，导致海冰上空云的液态水比例更高。总而言之，该研究利用遥感技术（卫星观测）和机器学习方法，定量分析了大气成分（气溶胶、海冰）对云相的影响，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析。,"['cloud phase', 'aerosol', 'sea ice', 'temperature', 'satellite observation', 'CloudSat', 'CALIPSO', 'Arctic', 'Southern Ocean', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing', 'air quality']",Barbara Dietel;Hendrik Andersen;Jan Cermak;Philip Stier;Corinna Hoose,"Combined Impacts of Temperature, Sea Ice Coverage, and Mixing Ratios of Sea Spray and Dust on Cloud Phase Over the Arctic and Southern Oceans","We analyze the importance of cloud top temperature, dust aerosol, sea salt aerosol, and sea ice cover for the thermodynamic phase of low‐level, mid‐level, and mid to low‐level clouds observed by CloudSat/CALIPSO over the Arctic and the Southern Ocean using an explainable machine learning technique. As expected, the cloud top temperature is found to be the most important parameter for determining cloud phase. The results show also a predictive power of sea salt and sea ice on the phase of low‐level clouds, while in mid‐level clouds dust shows predictive power. Over the Southern Ocean, strong zonal winds coincide with the aerosol distribution. While they can produce high mixing ratios of sea spray at lower levels, the strong zonal winds may prevent the pole‐ward transport of dust. Sea ice may prevent the release of sea salt aerosols and marine organic aerosols leading to higher liquid fractions in clouds over sea ice."
10.1029/2024GL111086,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了热带气旋中水汽静力能量 (MSE) 的空间变异性及其对热带气旋发展的预测作用。它利用1996年至2021年北大西洋上空探空仪的观测数据，对热带气旋中的MSE结构进行了迄今为止最广泛的观测分析。研究发现，MSE和其柱积分值(CMSE)随着距热带气旋中心的距离增加而减小，并且在1-2级飓风中空间变异性比热带风暴更大。此外，水分主导了MSE的空间变异性，但在热带气旋中心上层，温度也有贡献。虽然减弱和增强热带气旋之间MSE空间变异性的差异不太明显，但在大多数半径和垂直高度上，增强热带气旋的原始MSE往往更大。总的来说，这项研究使用了遥感技术（探空仪）观测大气成分（水汽静力能量）来改进热带气旋预报，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['moist static energy', 'tropical cyclones', 'dropsondes', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing', 'weather forecasting']",Michael V. Kopelman;Allison A. Wing;Jacob D. Carstens,Spatial Variability of Dropsonde‐Derived Moist Static Energy in North Atlantic Tropical Cyclones,"
The spatial variability of moist static energy (MSE) and its column‐integral (CMSE) around tropical cyclones (TCs) are known to help prognose TC development. Though limited in number and spatial coverage per TC, modeling work suggests that dropsondes, when strategically deployed, can reliably capture radial MSE and CMSE variability. This study uses North Atlantic upper‐level reconnaissance dropsondes from 1996 to 2021 to produce the most extensive observational analysis of MSE structure in TCs to date. MSE and CMSE decrease with distance from the TC center. MSE spatial variability is larger in Category 1 and 2 hurricanes compared to tropical storms, and generally largest after a TC's lifetime maximum intensity. Moisture dominates the MSE spatial variability but temperature contributes in the upper levels near the TC center. While differences in MSE spatial variability between weakening and intensifying TCs are less clear, raw MSE tends to be greater in intensifying TCs at most radii and vertical levels."

In this study, we investigated a comprehensive geodetic data set, employing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements to assess the rupture geometry associated with earthquake sequence. Although geodetic data can be satisfactorily reproduced by simple single‐fault models (i.e., a high‐angle E‐dipping plane related to the Longitudinal Valley Fault (LVF), or a gentle W‐dipping surface associated with the Central Range Fault, CRF), a composite model involving the rupture of different fault segments (a major CRF‐related W‐dipping fault, a deep segment of the E‐dipping LVF, and the Milun Fault) is able to explain the observations, the distribution of seismicity, and the complex structural arrangement of the northernmost sector of the Longitudinal Valley."

The continental United States is well instrumented with facilities for mid‐latitude upper atmosphere research that operate on a continuous basis. In addition, citizen scientists provide a wealth of information when unusual events occur. We combine ionospheric total electron content (TEC) data from distributed arrays of GNSS receivers, magnetometer chains, and auroral observations obtained by citizen scientists, to provide a detailed view of the intense auroral breakup and westward surge occurring at the peak of the 10–11 May 2024 extreme geomagnetic storm. Over a 20‐min interval, vertical TEC (vTEC) increased at unusually low latitude (∼45°) and rapidly expanded azimuthally across the continent. Individual receiver/satellite data sets indicate sharp bursts of greatly elevated of vTEC (∼50 TECu). Intense red aurora was co‐located with the leading edge of the equatorward and westward TEC enhancements, indicating that the large TEC enhancement was created by extremely intense low‐energy precipitation during the rapid substorm breakup."

The common understanding in surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is that the excitation pulse should be kept much shorter than the NMR relaxation times for an effective excitation. We present analytic, numerical, and experimental evidence demonstrating that this need not be so, and surface NMR signals can be retrieved even for absurdly long excitation pulses. We solve the Bloch equations in the limit of infinitely long excitation and use this result to demonstrate that a measurable magnetization can be obtained with long excitation pulses. We perform numerical simulations of the Bloch equations incorporating effects of relaxation‐during‐pulse, and our results suggest that long excitation pulses can be used to increase the depth of investigation, but that the spatial resolution of long pulse excitation is low. Data collected in Kompedal, Denmark using up to 3 s long excitation pulses provide experimental proof for the feasibility of long pulse surface NMR."

The Early Cenozoic sedimentary archives of Tibet are crucial for elucidating the geodynamic processes related to continental collision, particularly crustal deformation and shortening. However, the lack of a reliable chronostratigraphic framework for the Cenozoic sedimentary basins in central Tibet has hindered a comprehensive understanding of the influence of the continuous India‐Asia convergence process on the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan hinterland. Here, we report new magnetostratigraphic ages and paleomagnetic results for the Niubao Formation exposed in the northern bank of the Siling Co. Positive field tests and microscopic observations suggest that the remanence is primary. We determine that the depositional age of the measured section was between 59.2 and 48.6 Ma. Our results reveal that the paleogeographic location of the Bangong‐Nujiang Suture Zone during the Late Paleocene–Early Eocene was 25.4 ± 2.1°N, thus supporting the model of two‐stage collision between India and Asia."

Events B and C were lit up for a second time after the recurrence of a sprite element, extending their duration to approximately 1,084 ms and 732.6 ms, much longer than that (about 500 ms) for event A; the intensity of green emissions was also enhanced due to sprite recurrence.

We present an analysis of magnitude clustering of microfractures inferred from acoustic emissions (AEs) during stick‐slip (SS) dynamics of faulted Westerly granite samples in frictional sliding experiments, with and without fluids, under triaxial loading with constant displacement rate. We investigate magnitude clustering in time across periods during, preceding and after macroscopic slip events on laboratory faults. Our findings reveal that magnitude clustering exists such that subsequent AEs tend to have more similar magnitudes than expected. Yet, this clustering only exists during macroscopic slip events and is strongest during major slip events in fluid‐saturated and dry samples. We demonstrate that robust magnitude clustering arises from variations in frequency‐magnitude distributions of AE events during macroscopic slip events. These temporal variations indicate a prevalence of larger AE events right after (0.3–3 s) the SS onset. Hence, magnitude clustering is a consequence of non‐stationarities."

Stephens;Vincent E. Larson;Rob Newsom;William I. Gustafson Jr.;Gerhard Dikta,Methods to Evaluate Subcolumn Profiles Based on Two‐Point Diagnostics,"
In atmospheric models, stochastic generation of subgrid‐scale profiles or “subcolumns” has been used for a variety of purposes. Such subcolumns can be generated from subgrid probability density functions (PDFs) at different vertical levels, when such PDFs are available. To do so, the generator needs to decide how strongly points should be correlated in the vertical, that is, how much the values should be overlapped. This is sometimes called “PDF overlap.” To assess vertical correlation in a simplified, observable setting, here the vertical correlation of vertical velocity in subcloud layers is examined. Doppler lidar is used to evaluate the vertical profiles of vertical velocity produced by a large‐eddy simulation (LES) model and the Subgrid Importance Latin Hypercube Sampler (SILHS) subcolumn generator. In order to diagnose unrealistic features in subcolumn profiles, various statistical diagnostics are examined here, including the bivariate PDF of vertical velocity at two separated points (i.e., altitudes), the two‐point velocity correlation, the integral correlation length, the PDF of two‐point velocity differences, and the skewness and kurtosis of two‐point velocity differences. The profiles produced by LES match lidar well, except that they are too smooth at small scales. The profiles produced by SILHS exhibit sharp jumps from updraft to downdraft that are not observed in the lidar data. To reduce the generation of these unrealistically sharp jumps, the SILHS sampling method is revised. The diagnostics confirm that the revised sampling method reduces the overprediction of sharp jumps."

Changes in Arctic sea ice have exerted remarkably effects on the Eurasian climates, but it is unclear whether Arctic sea ice also contributes to Northwest China's ongoing summer drought. This study investigates the influence of the interannual variability of Arctic sea ice on the June drought in Northwest China from 1979 to 2021. It reveals that the early‐autumn sea ice in the East Siberian Sea is correlated with drought conditions in June in Northwest China, with a more pronounced connection during the period of 2000/2001–2020/2021 (P2) compared to 1979/1980–1999/2000 (P1). Mitigated drought in Northwest China is associated with anomalously high sea ice concentration (SIC) in the East Siberian Sea. Further analysis suggests that the strengthened link may be due to greater SIC variability in the East Siberian Sea during P2 than P1. In P2, positive early‐autumn SIC anomaly is linked to anomalous northeasterly winds, promoting drier soil and widespread cooling in the East European Plain. This dry soil signal may persist into the ensuing spring and early summer, inducing an anticyclonic circulation anomaly over Siberia, which could facilitate the water vapor convergence in Northwest China, thereby enhancing humidity conditions in the region. The insights from this study could offer valuable information for improved prediction of droughts in Northwest China."

In this study, we proposed an interpretable and accurate hybrid machine learning (ML) model, that explicitly represented the controls of fuel flammability, fuel availability, and human suppression effects on fires. The model demonstrated notable accuracy with a F1‐score of 0.846 ± 0.012, surpassing process‐driven fire danger indices and four commonly used ML models by up to 40% and 9%, respectively. More importantly, the ML model showed remarkably higher interpretability relative to other ML models. Specifically, by demystifying the “black box” of each ML model using the explainable AI techniques, we identified substantial structural differences across ML fire models, even among those with similar accuracy. The relationships between fires and their drivers, identified by our model, were aligned closer with established fire physical principles. The ML structural discrepancy led to diverse fire predictions and our model predictions exhibited greater consistency with actual fire occurrence. With the highly interpretable and accurate model, we revealed the strong compound effects from multiple climate variables related to evaporative demand, energy release component, temperature, and wind speed, on the dynamics of large fires and megafires in the western US.

Fire significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. The current global burned area (BA) products mainly have coarse native spatial resolution, which leads to underestimation of global BA and carbon emissions from biomass burning. Performances of BA products in Africa from GABAM (30 m), MCD64A1 (500 m), GFED4s (0.25°), FireCCI51 (250 m), and GFED5 (0.25°) were compared. From 2014 to 2020, GFED5 detected the most BA, 1.58 times more than GABAM during the same period. GABAM detected 0.09 Mkm2 more burned area than FireCCI51 on average. From 2014 to 2016, GABAM detected an average of 2.99 Mkm2 of BA in Africa, which was 1.03 times more than GFED4s. From 2014 to 2021, the average African BA derived from GABAM was 2.89 Mkm2, 1.22 times more than MCD64A1. The increase in BA will inevitably lead to an increase in the estimation of carbon emissions from biomass burning. Based on GABAM products and GFED framework, we estimated the average vegetation burning carbon emissions in Africa from 2014 to 2021 to be 1113.25 Tg, which is higher than GFED4s' carbon emissions in the same time period. This shows that the use of high‐resolution (30 m) burned area products to estimate carbon emissions can effectively avoid the underestimation of overall fire carbon emissions."

 Protease-containing ABC transporters (PCATs) couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the processing and export of diverse cargo proteins across cell membranes to mediate antimicrobial resistance and quorum sensing. Here, we combine biochemical analysis, single particle cryoEM, and DEER spectroscopy in lipid bilayers along with computational analysis to illuminate the structural and energetic underpinnings of coupled cargo protein export. Our integrated investigation uncovers competitive interplay between nucleotides and cargo protein binding that ensures the latter’s orderly processing and subsequent transport. The energetics of cryoEM structures in lipid bilayers are congruent with the inferred mechanism from ATP turnover analysis and reveal a snapshot of a high-energy outward-facing conformation that provides an exit pathway into the lipid bilayer and/or the extracellular side. DEER investigation of the core ABC transporter suggests evolutionary tuning of the energetic landscape to fulfill the function of substrate processing prior to export.

 Synthetic lethality (SL) is a gold mine of anticancer drug targets, exposing cancer-specific dependencies of cellular survival. To complement resource-intensive experimental screening, many machine learning methods for SL prediction have emerged recently. However, a comprehensive benchmarking is lacking. This study systematically benchmarks 12 recent machine learning methods for SL prediction, assessing their performance across diverse data splitting scenarios, negative sample ratios, and negative sampling techniques, on both classification and ranking tasks. We observe that all the methods can perform significantly better by improving data quality, e.g., excluding computationally derived SLs from training and sampling negative labels based on gene expression. Among the methods, SLMGAE performs the best. Furthermore, the methods have limitations in realistic scenarios such as cold-start independent tests and context-specific SLs. These results, together with source code and datasets made freely available, provide guidance for selecting suitable methods and developing more powerful techniques for SL virtual screening.

 Recently, Autoencoders (AEs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection, owing to their powerful capability in handling high-dimensional data. However, they often overlook the inherent global distribution characteristics and long-range dependencies in hyperspectral images (HSI). This oversight makes it challenging to accurately characterize and describe boundaries between different backgrounds and anomalies in complex HSI, thereby affecting detection accuracy. To address this issue, a robust multi-stage progressive autoencoder for hyperspectral anomaly detection (RMSAD) is proposed. Initially, a progressive multi-stage learning framework based on convolutional autoencoders is employed. This framework incrementally reveals and integrates deep contextual features along with their long-range dependencies in HSI, aiming to accurately characterize the background and anomalies. Subsequently, an innovative multi-scale fusion strategy is introduced at the intersections of each stage, reinforcing the learning and representation of background and global spatial details across multiple stages. Finally, by collectively extracting abnormal spatial information across stages, effectively reducing the tendency of autoencoders to reconstruct anomalies. This ensures the efficient restoration and replication of global textural details in HSI. The experimental results on the six HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed RMSAD is superior to other state-of-the-art methods."

 Commercial districts, as the epicenters of urban commerce and economic activity, largely reflect an area’s prosperity through their customer flow. However, previous research, which often relied on statistical and survey data, has typically not captured the full scope of customer flow dynamics throughout urban commercial districts and has not adequately measured the specific impacts of business district locations and their surrounding communities on customer flow. To bridge these gaps, this study utilizes multidimensional big geo-data resources, including mobile phone signaling data, Points of Interest (POI) data, and transportation network data, to uncover the underlying factors that influence customer flow within urban commercial districts. The findings suggest that several factors—the size of the commercial district, the diversity of business formats, the convenience of parking, the working and residential population in surrounding communities, and the proximity to urban centers—significantly influence the customer flow. Consumers show a preference for larger-scale, centrally-located commercial districts that offer convenient parking options, while a homogenized and uncharacteristic business format may reduce a commercial district’s appeal. Furthermore, the study reveals that industrial parks and mixed-use complexes within the 15-minute living circle surrounding the commercial district have a stronger attraction to customer flow than residential neighborhoods do. The insights from this research not only guide the strategic placement of new commercial centers but also provide a robust framework for enhancing the layout of urban commercial spaces and for the revitalization and advancement of established commercial districts."

 Various combustion processes occur concurrently during biomass burning events, emitting a complex mixture of particulate and gaseous pollutants into the atmosphere. These emissions undergo chemical transformations facilitated by factors such as solar radiation and cloud formation, thereby altering the composition of aerosols. Additionally, these pollutants can affect the region of origin and neighboring countries, presenting regional and global environmental challenges. Therefore, precise evaluation of the particulate and gaseous pollutants emitted during biomass burning is essential to formulate effective management strategies. This study aimed to assess the concentration and chemical characteristics of particulate matter emitted during biomass burning in South Korea. On June 7, 2021, a research flight was conducted utilizing a High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) for airborne measurements over South Korea inland areas. For data analysis based on administrative regions, the flight path was divided into four major areas (Areas A, B, C, and D). During the research flight, evidence of biomass burning events was observed primarily in Area C. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis categorized the organic aerosols (OA) into five factors: biomass burning OA (BBOA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA1, HOA2), low-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), and more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). Across all areas, MO-OOA accounted for the highest proportion of aerosols, whereas BBOA dominated in Area C at 23.8%, indicating the significant influence of biomass burning in this region. Instead of running a PMF analysis with all measurement data, a BBOA formula was derived from the previous study and this one. This allows us to estimate BBOA concentration without running PMF."

 Gaseous nitrous acid (HONO) plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, but there is still controversy regarding its sources. Recent studies have shown that soil can emit significant amounts of HONO. In order to further investigate the impact mechanism of soil HONO emissions and refine the estimation model of soil HONO emissions fluxes, this study employed a random forest model to estimate soil HONO emission fluxes and identified key influencing factors. By measuring in the laboratory and integrating global literature on soil HONO emissions, this study analyzed the characteristics of soil HONO emissions and their relationship with environmental factors. The results indicated that croplands emit significantly more HONO than other land use types. Furthermore, during wet-dry cycles, total soil HONO emissions showed a significant positive correlation with NO2− content and clay content, and also correlated significantly with maximum HONO emissions, total NO emissions, and maximum NO emissions (P < 0.001). Using a random forest model, a mapping relationship between soil environmental factors and total HONO emissions was constructed, with soil pH, NH4+, NO3−, NO2−, clay, silt, sand, total nitrogen, total carbon, total organic carbon, carbon-nitrogen ratio, and soil texture as input features. The results indicated that the model accounts for 56% of the variance in total soil HONO emissions within the test set.
