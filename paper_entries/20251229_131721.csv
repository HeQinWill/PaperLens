It provides reliable, high-quality data essential for accurately analysing short-term sea level variations and extreme events, which are often overlooked due to limited resolution or insufficient quality control in existing datasets. 
 Availability of high-quality sub-hourly sea level data is essential for understanding of a wide range of oceanic processes, including tidal oscillations, seiches, storm surges, tsunamis (including meteotsunamis), and their impact on sea level extremes and coastal flooding. Freely accessible sea level databases often contain time series measured with hourly or even longer sampling step, or they contain high-frequency data that have not undergone quality control procedures. To address this gap, the SHELDA (Sub-Hourly European Quality Controlled Sea Level DAtaset) has been created. This dataset comprises 257 individual tide gauge records in NetCDF format (https://doi.org/10.14284/764, Balić and Šepić, 2025), each representing quality-controlled sea level time series sampled at intervals between 1 and 15 minutes, along with residual time series derived by removing tidal components. This paper outlines the rigorous quality control procedures implemented and describes the spatial and temporal coverage of the dataset, along with technical specifications. SHELDA enables precise identification and analysis of sea level variability at timescales from minutes to multi-yearly along the European coasts, including Greenland, Canary Islands, Israel, Lebanon and Türkiye."

The results reveal a persistent loss of oxygen, strongest below the surface and in major low-oxygen zones, with recent acceleration in several ocean regions. This open dataset supports climate research and assessments of risks for marine ecosystems. 
 Oceanic oxygen levels, crucial for marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, have declined significantly over the past few decades due to climate change, posing severe environmental risks. However, historical dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements, especially below 2,000 m, remain sparse, limiting comprehensive annual and seasonal analyses. Here, we introduce the BLENDR framework (Bayesian-optimized Learning and ENsemble modeling for Data Reconstruction), a Bayesian-optimized ensemble of six machine-learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Extremely Randomized Trees and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting) fused via dynamic weighting, to reconstruct global monthly DO distributions at a 1° × 1° resolution from the surface to 5,902 m from 1960 to 2023. Validation against an independent dataset demonstrated that BLENDR achieves lower errors than any individual model. Our dataset captures depth-dependent deoxygenation, with the most pronounced decline occurring between 150 and 200 m, and reveals severely accelerated oxygen loss in the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic over the past decade. This work provides the first long-term, global monthly DO product from the ocean surface to 5,902 m. The bathypelagic DO data provided in this work is a significant contribution to deep ocean oxygen dynamics and global biogeochemical cycles."

To reduce carbon emissions, we need accurate predictions of energy demand, which depend on knowing the outdoor temperature at which buildings start heating or cooling. We used artificial intelligence to create the first global dataset of these temperature thresholds for regions worldwide. Our dataset improves energy demand prediction accuracy by 10%, supporting better energy planning and climate policy decisions. 
 Accurate building energy demand modeling is critical to decarbonizing regional energy systems. The cooling and heating degree-day models are widely used due to their simplicity and low data requirements; however, the lack of accurate base temperature data limits their performance. In particular, the scarcity of high temporal resolution building energy demand data constrains regional-scale base temperature estimation through conventional methods such as the energy signature method and the performance line method. To address this limitation, this study develops a global regional-scale base temperature dataset based on the BiLSTM neural network framework with an attention mechanism. The dataset includes both cooling base temperature (Tcool) and heating base temperature (Theat) for each region, defined at a spatial scale equivalent to a U.S. state or a Chinese province. The BiLSTM framework demonstrates strong performance, with RMSE values of 1.39°C for training and 1.33°C for testing, and Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.84 for Tcool and 0.70 for Theat. Predicted results show that global Tcool ranges from 19–25°C and Theat from 14–18°C, consistent with physical principles. External validations using 16 independent datasets demonstrate that the predicted base temperatures significantly improve the accuracy of building energy demand modeling, reducing RMSE by 10.01% for cooling and 10.02% for heating, compared to official or empirical base temperatures. This dataset supplements sparse observational base temperature data and enhances the accuracy of building energy demand modeling, contributing to low-carbon energy system planning, broader climate impact assessment and weather-related financial applications. The proposed global Tbase dataset can be acquired from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30646376.v2 (He et al., 2025)."

Here, we analyzed the ground-based measurement data of O3, formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) collected from 2011 to 2020 at two sites in eastern Australia, namely, Memorial Park and Springwood. Only HCHO at Memorial Park showed a statistically significant upward trend (0.19 ppb yr–1). Compared with the sea-influenced air masses, the land-influenced air masses were observed to enhance all pollutant concentrations at two sites. According to the site-specific sensitivity of the O3 to the HCHO-to-NO2 ratio (FNR), the daytime formation of the O3 at two sites was mainly in the volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regime. When the long-term variability of NO2 was weak, HCHO, particularly from primary emissions indicated by BTX, was observed to predominantly control the monthly FNR at each site over time. Our work underscores the importance of long-term in situ measurements in interpreting ground-level O3 formation and potentially informs future O3 studies in other areas in the Southern Hemisphere."

Despite its relatively low concentrations, summertime O3 pollution has become more severe in the past decade, with increasingly frequent O3 pollution events and elevated concentrations across South China. Interestingly, 39 regional high-O3 episodes occurred under strong summer monsoon influences, which challenged the conventional view that clean air brought by the monsoon solely dilutes air pollution. The WRF-CMAQ simulations revealed that while local emissions primarily drove daytime O3 formation in South China, emissions from mainland Southeast Asia and shipping substantially contributed to average hourly O3 in South China by 4 ppbv. Unexpectedly, the Beibu Gulf acted as an O3 reservoir, where O3 and its precursors from upwind regions and ship emissions accumulated and reacted, transporting O3 to South China through southerly winds. These findings redefine the dual role of the summer monsoon, demonstrating that it can both alleviate pollution and facilitate the transboundary transport of air pollutants. Our study underscores the increasing challenge that emissions in Southeast Asia and shipping activities pose to air quality in South China, calling for transboundary cooperation to manage O3 pollution."

However, the systemic risks associated with excessive CCS deployment remain underexplored, particularly in fossil-dependent economies like China. Using a scenario-driven integrated framework coupling the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) with an input–output model, we quantitatively evaluate the implications of excessive CCS adoption in China’s power transition. Results indicate that excessive CCS deployment leads to a 14.63 petawatt-hour increase in thermal power generation by 2060, simultaneously causing a significant crowding-out of wind and solar capacity. This shift results in a 4,128 MtCO2 emission rebound by 2060, exceeding 10 Gt by 2100─around 3% of the remaining carbon budget for the 1.5 °C target. Concurrently, air pollutant emissions, including CO, NOx, and SO2 rise substantially, with CO annual emissions projected to double post-2050. Additionally, the pathway is projected to reduce employment by an additional 11 million and take up nearly a quarter of China’s annual water use by 2060. Contrary to prevailing narratives emphasizing CCS cost-efficiency, this study highlights its structural trade-offs and underscores the need for system-wide optimization frameworks and adaptive governance mechanisms to ensure long-term sustainability."

However, the dependence of the acid modification effect on the molecular structure has not yet been focused on. In this work, using MoO3-modified Pt/Al2O3 as model catalysts, and the catalytic combustion of VOCs with different molecular structure characteristics as probe reactions, it was revealed that MoO3 modification showed a dialectical effect (promotional or inhibitory) on Pt/Al2O3 catalytic activity due to the molecular structure sensitivity. Further characterizations suggested that the enhanced surface acidity and more metallic Pt sites on MoO3-modified Al2O3 would benefit the oxidation of alkanes (e.g., propane and cyclohexane) due to the alleviated alkane-O2 competitive adsorption as well as the promoted C–H activation and intermediate decomposition/desorption, while the overstrong adsorption of VOCs containing π bond (e.g., toluene and propene) on MoO3-modified Pt/Al2O3 significantly suppressed the deep oxidation process and thus resulted in an inferior reactivity. This work was the first to systematically investigate the molecular structure sensitivity of the acid modification effect on the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts, which would guide the rational design of efficient catalysts from the perspective of the molecular structure."

HFC-134a measurements mainly rely on ground-based globally distributed networks with sparse spatial coverage. Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) observes HFC-134a above 5 km globally, thus bridging observational gaps in the upper atmosphere and facilitating radiative forcing assessments. However, validation of ACE-FTS HFC-134a retrievals remains limited. Here, we evaluate the latest ACE-FTS HFC-134a retrievals using surface, aircraft, and balloon observations, with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) as the intercomparison platform. ACE-FTS HFC-134a retrievals exhibit systematic low biases across all altitudes during 2016–2024, varying from 0.7–15.3% (10–20 km), 12.1–26.6% (below 10 km), to 7.2–22.0% (above 20 km), likely due to retrieval limitations and water vapor interference not fully addressed in the current retrieval algorithm. Interperiod comparison suggests a mean observation-model difference ranging from −12.6% to −10.9%, implying stable ACE-FTS HFC-134a retrievals over time without degradation. This study integrates available in situ measurements with a CTM to indirectly validate HFC-134a observations from space, demonstrating a valuable framework for assessing satellite retrievals of a range of other fluorinated greenhouse gases."

Here, the photodegradation of six representative SAs under 222 nm irradiation was investigated, emphasizing the roles of dissociated forms (neutral and deprotonated) and substituent structures (five-membered and six-membered heterocyclic). Results demonstrated that SAs’ photodegradation proceeded through both direct photolysis and radical-mediated self-sensitized pathways. Dissociated forms primarily influenced the kinetics and the relative contributions of dual pathways: deprotonated forms (SAs0,–) generally degraded faster than their neutral forms (SAs+,–), and they are also more prone to attack by selectively photogenerated radicals. Substituent structures dictated bond-cleavage modes in direct photolysis: five-membered ring (5R) SAs underwent O–N or S–N cleavage, while six-membered ring (6R) SAs favored SO2 extrusion. In the self-sensitized pathway, hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and superoxide radicals (O2•–) were identified as the major reactive oxygen species (ROS), with •OH exhibiting a unique dual origin from both dissolved oxygen (DO) and H2O molecules. These findings provide mechanistic insights into 222 nm far-UVC-driven SAs degradation and inform the design of efficient, mercury-free UV-based water treatment systems."

In this study, we constructed a comparative transcriptome database from seven Pteris species, including four As hyperaccumulators and three nonhyperaccumulators, to identify key genes driving As hyperaccumulation. We found that P. vittata uniquely possesses both plasma membrane-localized (Type-I) and tonoplast-localized (Type-II) ACR3s, facilitating AsIII translocation and sequestration. Additionally, P. vittata shows an expansion of HAC and ACR3 gene families, supporting enhanced AsV reduction and AsIII transport. Evolutionary analyses revealed strong positive selection on Type-II PvACR3s, with specific adaptive amino acid sites identified. Functional assays showed that coexpression of Type-I (PvACR3) and Type-II (PvACR3;1) ACR3s in an Arabidopsis thaliana hac1 mutant increased shoot As contents by 5.5–6.3-fold compared to wild-type plants, further supporting the important role of synergistic interaction between two ACR3 types in As hyperaccumulation.

This study develops a semianalytical model to investigate transient vapor migration under varying source strengths (large-volume, diminishing, and fluctuating) and source types (groundwater and soil-gas). For large-volume sources, vertical vapor concentration profiles in soils with high moisture stabilize over 50 years, demonstrating that steady-state screening-level models may mischaracterize long-term exposure risks. The soil diffusion time scale approximates the overall time scale of the VI pathway, identifying subsurface vapor migration as the limiting process. The capillary fringe above groundwater sources slows vapor migration. For finite and diminishing sources, indoor air concentrations rise from zero to a peak value before declining back to zero. Altering the system’s influx and outflux can effectively mitigate VI risks: increasing the ratio of the building volume to the source volume shortens the peak arrival time, and increasing the air exchange rate reduces the peak indoor air concentration. For periodic sources, a highly fluctuating attenuation factor indicates that the soil diffusion time scale is comparable to or much smaller than the source period, necessitating time-dependent VI analysis for long-term exposure assessments. Conversely, steady indoor air concentrations at late times suggest that the VI time scale far exceeds the source period, and periodic sources behave similarly to large-volume sources. A linear system approach is proposed to simulate diminishing or sporadically varying source strengths and is applied to a recent VI field test under a fluctuating trichloroethylene groundwater source. The approach effectively generates continuous results from sparse field measurements, with the simulated VI pathway exhibiting patterns consistent with the transient semianalytical model."

With increasing population growth and food demand, the spatial decoupling of production and consumption has intensified, driving a surge in transnational agricultural products transportation. However, existing research lacks a systematic assessment and future projection of GHG emissions from agricultural product transportation across multiple transport modes worldwide. To address this gap, we developed a global trade-linked transport GHG emission database by integrating multisource data and modeling frameworks. Compared with the research method in this paper, the previous great circle distance as the GHG emission of agricultural product transportation mileage was underestimated by 34%. This study systematically evaluates the spatiotemporal evolution of agricultural transport GHG emissions from 2000 to 2021 and explores their mitigation potential under future scenarios. Our findings reveal that global GHG emissions from agricultural transport increased by 1.6-fold over the 21-year period, with rising GHG emission intensity and trade density collectively shaping a high-carbon flow pattern dominated by exports from the Americas to Asia. Future scenario analyses indicate that the localization strategies proposed in this study are not particularly effective in reducing transport-related GHG emissions as inefficiencies inherent in localized agricultural production can increase production-stage emissions and, in turn, result in a net rise in total GHG outputs. These results suggest that future strategies should prioritize optimizing trade structures while simultaneously enhancing domestic agricultural productivity and promoting low-carbon farming technologies to achieve net emission reductions at the source."

This study developed a novel strategy of hydroxyapatite-modified biochar (PBC) application derived from Se-enriched straw for enhanced rice Se and economic benefits through cross-scale investigations encompassing soil incubation, pot experiments, and field trials. Results indicated that rice straw exhibited both a higher Se enrichment factor (59.3%) from soil and concentration (0.211 mg kg–1) than grains. Application of 1% (w/w) PBC (modified at 2% concentration (w/w)) maximally increased soil-available Se and grain Se content by 47.2% and 55.6%, respectively, compared to the control. The soil Se mobilization mechanism involved three synergistic pathways: intrinsic Se release, adsorption suppression, and soil Se activation. Subsequently, PBC augmented Se sequestration in root iron plaques through enhanced iron deposition, then upregulated expression of transmembrane transporter genes (OsSULTR1;2, OsPT2, OsNIP2;1, and OsSULTR2;1), facilitating Se uptake and translocation. Economically, PBC application generated net benefits of US$18,301 per hectare, representing US$1,137 and US$16,476 increases over BC and control, respectively.

However, the mechanism through which extracellular SeNPs (Ex-SeNPs) are exported remains unclear. In this study, we characterized Ex-SeNPs biosynthesized by Escherichia coli during the aerobic reduction of selenite. The SeNPs appeared within 2 h of exposure, remained extracellular, and displayed a consistent spherical morphology (∼100 nm). Purified Ex-SeNPs consisted of an Se0 core enveloped by a membrane-like layer containing lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, peptidoglycan, and lipopolysaccharides. Fluorescence microscopy and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry indicated that the encapsulated membrane originates from the E. coli cell membrane. Notably, mutants deficient in the outer membrane proteins OmpC or TolA failed to excrete SeNPs, resulting in intracellular accumulation despite efficient Se0 synthesis. Our findings suggest that E. coli forms SeNPs intracellularly and exports them via an envelope-dependent process, during which the particles may become encapsulated in membrane-like structures. These findings help clarify the mechanism underlying a membrane-dependent pathway for SeNP detoxification and export that had been suggested but not directly demonstrated."

However, alternative fuels like hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol are not inherently “good” simply because they can be produced with low-carbon methods. Their climate and environmental impacts vary widely depending on how they are produced, handled, and used─factors that most assessments fail to fully account for. This can result in poorly informed decision-making, with overestimated benefits of deployment choices. In this Perspective, we highlight potential environmental impacts from alternative fuel value chains and provide an actionable guide for their responsible deployment. Specifically, we provide a brief overview of alternative fuel attributes, assess climate and air quality implications across production, handling, and use, and discuss technological, political-economic, social, and other environmental considerations for responsible deployment. We recommend improvements to alternative fuel assessments and suggest safeguards to maximize their climate and environmental integrity, including best-in-class practices and enabling policies. Given the urgency of achieving global climate goals, it is critical to ensure that scaling up of alternative fuels adheres to sustainable practices from the outset."

This study investigates how behavioral preferences (i.e., individual tendencies in how people value future outcomes, perceive and respond to risk, and interact with others) and prior knowledge influence decision-making in a simulated water crisis. A total of 130 participants completed a behavioral preference survey and engaged in a five-party serious game simulating an acute drinking water contamination incident. Analyses at individual, group, and role levels revealed that decisions related to communication, action-taking, and satisfaction were largely driven by role responsibilities, with limited behavioral preference effects. However, aggregated behavioral preferences, e.g., group-averaged probability weighting and loss aversion, explained collective decision-making patterns. The role-specific analysis further revealed the interactions between certain behavioral preferences and role performance: for instance, altruism reduced residents’ likelihood of demanding compensation but increased the contamination exposure rate. Taken together, these findings suggest that behavioral preferences are a modifiable component of emergency preparedness. These findings underscore the importance of institutional clarity, leveraging behavioral diversity, and training that integrates behavioral assessment and cross-role learning to enhance the water emergency response."

Here, we present an aqueous-phase nanoencapsulation strategy using natural polysaccharides to construct a mechano-responsive hydration network that ensures safe INP storage and controlled deployment. By engineering a polysaccharide-based hydration matrix, we immobilize 30 wt % INP within a noncombustible viscoelastic solid, eliminating pyrophoric risks while achieving <0.5% daily Fe(0) loss and >96% H2 evolution suppression over 60 days under practical storage and transport conditions─outperforming conventional aqueous slurry in reactivity preservation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the matrix enables dual preservation pathways: (1) microenvironment engineering via 1.1 nm hydrophilic nanoconfinement, which restricts water mobility, increases bound water phases (∼45%), and elevates Fe(0)-H2O reaction barriers by +1.56/0.93 eV; and (2) autonomous corrosion inhibition through an in situ-formed H2 coating. The mechano-responsive design facilitates on-demand liberation via shear-driven dissolution, yielding injectable suspensions with enhanced functionality (e.g., colloidal stability, subsurface mobility, and contaminant removal efficiency). Multiscale characterizations─from molecular dynamics simulations to contaminant remediation─validate the approach. This strategy secures the entire INP remediation lifecycle (storage, transport, and injection), establishing an integrated platform that synergizes fundamental water-structure manipulation with autonomously formed gas-phase shielding principles for safe, sustainable nanoremediation."

However, the electron transfer from S-nZVI to TCE or water also results in leaching of Fe2+, and the mitigation of this reaction has not been addressed. Anaerobic corrosion of 1.2 g/L S-nZVI during TCE degradation led to high dissolved Fe, up to 353 ± 26 mg/L under electron-excess conditions and 427 ± 30.2 mg/L under electron-limited conditions, thus compromising treated water quality during (ground)water treatment. In this study, a dittmarite-S-nZVI (DS-nZVI) composite yielded efficient TCE degradation with the continuous sequestration of released Fe. S-nZVI was well-dispersed on the dittmarite (NH4MgPO4·H2O) nanosheets. DS-nZVI yielded faster and complete dechlorination and a ∼1000-fold decrease in Fe leaching (<0.3 mg/L) compared to S-nZVI (353 ± 26 mg/L) under electron excess conditions, and >90% iron removal under electron-limited conditions with TCE degradation capacity of 1.46 × 1023 molecules per mol of Fe0. Continuous exchange of Fe2+ with Mg2+ ions and complexation with phosphate ions was followed by structural transformation to crystalline baricite, (Fe, Mg)3(PO4)2·8H2O, leading to a more sustainable TCE degradation approach for groundwater remediation."

We applied an enhanced positive matrix factorization approach integrating VOC and organic aerosol measurements. This unified analysis identifies the well-documented cooking organic aerosol (COA, ∼21% of total OA) and, importantly, extracts cooking-emitted VOCs through COA constraints. The extracted VOC profile is corroborated well by direct kitchen cooking experiments. Our results show that cooking emissions constitute ∼7% of total atmospheric VOC mixing ratio. Further analysis demonstrates that cooking-emitted VOCs contribute to both secondary pollution formation and health risks. These environmental impacts have been largely overlooked in previous ambient VOC assessments due to the failure to identify cooking-emitted VOCs. These findings challenge the conventional practice of venting cooking emissions outdoors to protect indoor air quality, suggesting the necessity of an end-of-pipe treatment for cooking exhaust. This study demonstrates an advanced data-driven source apportionment strategy that directly integrates multiple data sets within a single PMF analysis. By leveraging mutual constraints among coemitted pollutants, this unified approach enhances source separation and factor interpretation through internal cross-validation without requiring prior source profiles."

The SEW and its exposure–response (E–R) relationship were assessed. Doctor-diagnosed AR prevalence was 11.9%. Average O3 exposure from prenatal to AR onset ranged from 67.5 to 76.7 μg/m3. The critical SEW was identified as infancy, specifically 30–38 weeks postnatal (7.5–9.5 months). Per interquartile range (IQR) (10.1 μg/m3) increase in O3, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.29 (95% CI: 1.22–1.36), independent of PM2.5. The E–R relationship was nonlinear, J-shaped, and threshold-free. The SEW effect was stronger in southern cities and mitigated by ≥6 months of exclusive breastfeeding. In conclusion, O3 significantly increases AR risk, with 7.5–9.5 months postnatal being a critical SEW, especially in exclusive breastfeeding <6 months and southern regions."

Understanding ARG transmission within soil-plant systems is crucial for developing control strategies to mitigate associated human health risks in agroecosystems. This review synthesized the primary sources of ARGs in the soil-plant system, elucidates their transmission pathways and key influencing factors, and systematically analyzed their potential health effects alongside attenuation strategies. Finally, current research gaps and future priorities were discussed. By providing a comprehensive overview of ARG environmental behavior, fate, and risks within the soil-plant system, this work aims to inform the development of control strategies and risk mitigation measures for researchers and environmental policymakers."

This study quantified 10 UVA congeners in urinary samples from 254 Beijing residents aged 19–44 years, revealing pervasive exposure to UVAs. The specific gravity-adjusted concentrations of 10 UVAs (∑10UVAs) ranged from 1.90 ng/mL to 2.03 × 103 ng/mL (geometric mean: 43.7 ng/mL), with UV-P (20.3 ng/mL), UV-360 (11.2 ng/mL), and UV-329 (6.34 ng/mL) as dominant compounds, indicating substantial environmental bioavailability. Women showed 2.7-fold higher ∑10UVAs in the summer (80.0 vs 29.3 ng/mL) and 1.7-fold higher ∑10UVAs in the winter (48.6 vs 28.0 ng/mL) than men, revealing sex-dependent and season-dependent exposure. Congener-specific detection patterns indicated multiple exposure sources and differential bioaccumulation behaviors. Critically, UVA exposure showed congener-specific and nonlinear associations with oxidative stress biomarkers (OSBs). UV-329, in particular, exhibited dual pro-oxidative and antioxidant effects across all four measured urinary OSBs. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) analyses further revealed significant effect modifications by sex, season, and alcohol consumption, underscoring interactions between chemical coexposure and individual susceptibility.

We assessed temporal trends in concentrations and performed latent profile analysis jointly with log-binomial regression to uncover patterns of chemical exposures in our population and their associations with sociodemographic, temporal, and behavioral predictors. Parabens, bactericides, and di (2-ethylhexyl phthalate) metabolite concentrations (ng/mL) decreased during our study period. Fungicide and herbicides and phthalate, organophosphorus flame retardant, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolite concentrations (ng/mL) spiked in warmer months. Latent profile analysis identified two distinct profiles: women with moderate levels of most analytes and women with low levels of most analytes. We observed no association between predictors and profile membership. However, chemical groups were significantly associated with season, indicators of low socioeconomic status, and home characteristics and behaviors in linear regression models. We highlight the need for national surveillance systems to incorporate biomonitoring that capture emerging exposures across diverse populations."

However, an alternative risk assessment method to prospective longitudinal studies of exposome-metabolome interactions for liver inflammation-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is lacking. This study investigates the risk of long-term real-world PM2.5 exposure in hepatocarcinogenesis through machine learning techniques. Shotgun mass spectrometry (MS) imaging data were acquired from mouse models across a continuum of fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC for training a multiclass classification model to identify “No Risk”, “Cancer Risk”, and “Cancer”. Direct infusion-MS data from PM2.5-exposed mouse livers were analyzed to classify risk. By integrating data-driven and knowledge-based approaches, 14 disease progression biomarkers were identified for modeling. Our results suggest that chronic real-world PM2.5 exposure can induce liver fibrosis, presenting cancer risk. Incorporating metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics, we propose PM2.5 exposure induces mitochondrial dysfunction, activates AMPK signaling, and increases ceramide accumulation, potentially mediating insulin resistance that contributes to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and HCC progression. This work represents a significant advancement in assessing hepatotoxicity of environmental toxicants by reducing reliance on traditional animal testing methods. It also underscores the potential of emerging technologies in transforming our understanding of PM2.5 exposure, paving the way for targeted interventions."

However, the impact of cold spells, a common ETE, on adolescent mental health remains unclear. The study aims to explore the impacts of cold spells, defined with different intensities and durations, on adolescent mental health across China while also establishing risk-driven thresholds for cold spells and identifying vulnerable subpopulations. The data was derived from the 2019 survey cycle of the Chinese National Surveillance on Students’ Constitution and Health, conducted between September and December and encompassing 149,697 adolescents aged 10–18 from 30 provinces. Cold spells were defined by using a series of cutoff temperature thresholds and durations. We assessed cold spell frequency and average cold intensity during the 12 months prior to the survey based on 0.1° × 0.1° gridded apparent temperature data. Troubled symptoms were measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. We applied generalized linear mixed models to estimate the associations, and risk-driven thresholds for cold spells were determined based on the distribution of risk estimates. Among participants, 10.9% reported troubled symptoms. Higher cold spell frequency and average cold intensity were associated with increased odds of troubled symptoms. Risk-related thresholds were set using daily apparent temperatures at or below the fifth percentile for ≥3 days (P5_3d) or the 2.5 percentile for ≥2 days (P2.5_2d). Early warning and avoidance of cold spell exposure could potentially prevent 2.8–3.5% of troubled symptoms. Younger adolescents, female adolescents, rural residents, and those in lower GDP regions were more vulnerable. Our findings suggest that cold spells exceeding certain thresholds may adversely impact adolescent mental health, emphasizing the need for targeted cold-health early warning systems."

However, its traditional practices, such as burning incense and setting off fireworks, generate severe air pollution and pose significant health threats. This presents a critical dilemma regarding how rural residents balance the imperatives of cultural preservation against environmental health risks. This study investigates this trade-off using a multidisciplinary approach. Field measurements within a rural household during the 2024 festival revealed alarmingly high indoor PM2.5 levels, peaking above 1000 μg/m3 on New Year’s Eve and averaging over 600 μg/m3. Furthermore, a survey of 1035 residents across nine northern provinces found that 38.7% and 19.7% reported adverse physiological symptoms from high outdoor and indoor pollutant levels, respectively. Notably, of those experiencing symptoms, an overwhelming 81.8% were still willing to tolerate temporary air pollution for cultural fulfillment derived from the festival. This underscores that for these rural residents, the perceived value of traditional observance can outweigh immediate environmental health concerns. Therefore, policymakers must develop strategies that reconcile public health and cultural heritage. Effective interventions could include promoting eco-friendly fireworks, organizing pollution-free community events, and subsidizing advanced ventilation technologies."

Here, we sought to clarify the potential promoting effects of PS-NPs on ovarian cancer. Our results first showed that ovarian cancer cells could internalize 50 nm PS-NPs, with significant internalization observed at concentrations starting from 20 μg/mL, which aligns with environmental exposure levels. RNA-seq and subsequent experiments indicated that treatment with 20 μg/mL PS-NPs significantly promoted ovarian cancer cell proliferation, and this phenotype was closely associated with CDK4/6-dependent cell cycle regulation. The CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib effectively reverses the cell proliferation induced by PS-NPs. An oral exposure model in mice found tissue deposition of PS-NPs in the ovaries, kidneys, heart, and lungs. In vivo models further confirmed that mice exposed to PS-NPs had larger subcutaneous tumor weights and volumes compared to the control group, while Palbociclib could successfully block these effects. In conclusion, our research revealed that low-dose PS-NPs could stimulate ovarian tumor progression both in vivo and in vitro in a CDK4/6-dependent manner. Taken together, our study provides potential evidence for risk management of exposure to nanoplastics related to cancer development."

Building on our previous finding that PM2.5 alters m6A RNA methylation, we hypothesized that PAHs drive asthma progression through epitranscriptomic regulation. Here, we show that PAH exposure aggravated lung injury, airway remodeling, and fibrosis while reducing global m6A levels─an effect reversed by AhR inhibition. Mechanistically, PAH-activated AhR suppressed transcription of the m6A demethylase FTO, leading to widespread hypomethylation. Reduced m6A deposition on ACKR3 mRNA enhanced its stability through IGF2BP1/2/3 binding, thereby increasing ACKR3 expression. Elevated ACKR3 promoted autophagy and inflammatory signaling in bronchial epithelial cells. Consistently, FTO-deficient mice displayed exacerbated airway inflammation, fibrosis, and ACKR3-driven autophagy. Moreover, PAHs activated the TNFα/NF-κB pathway, further amplifying autophagy and inflammation. Together, these findings define a previously unrecognized AhR–FTO–ACKR3 epitranscriptomic axis through which PAHs potentiate NF-κB signaling, autophagy, and airway injury, providing new mechanistic insight and potential therapeutic targets for pollution-driven asthma."

We sampled their scalp and facial hair periodically to evaluate hair as a biomarker to track shifts in methylmercury (MeHg) exposure from diet. Each individual differed in the onset and extent of MeHg accumulation but showed similar depuration rates. Pretrip baseline Hg isotope values between participants were distinct from Gabonese fishes allowing us to detect shifts in MeHg sources in the hair of both individuals. δ202Hg values tracked the mass-dependent fractionation of MeHg depuration stemming from in vivo metabolism, leading to δ202Hg increases of 0.014 ± 0.001 per mille and total Hg losses of 8.3 ± 1.1 ng g–1 daily. While limited in scope due to minimal participants, our findings reveal a complex interaction between prior MeHg burdens, contemporary MeHg intakes, and sources of consumed fishes (locally caught versus market-sourced) in determining the dynamics of MeHg concentrations and δ202Hg in human hair. We also suggest that the offset in δ202Hg values used in literature between fish and human hair (1.75 ± 0.25‰) may overlook a time domain that increases starting fish-hair δ202Hg offsets  (0.94‰), through time."

Urinary pathogens of human origin, frequently detected in contaminated water and surfaces, represent early indicators of ARB-related exposure. However, current exposure assessment approaches rely heavily on standard strains, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. In this study, a label-free platform was developed by integrating surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the ARB exposure assessment. A comprehensive spectral database consisting of 368 clinical urinary isolates was established. The CNN achieved the highest classification accuracy (97.6%), surpassing random forest (93.1%) and PCA-SVM (91.2%). Robust performance was further confirmed in wastewater samples (92.2%) and independent urine specimens (90.3%). Importantly, SHAP-based interpretation revealed key discriminatory features in the 724–738 cm–1 region, associated with adenine and tryptophan, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Together, these findings establish a practical and transparent framework for microbial surveillance and ARB exposure assessment.

They can cause hepatic lipid interventions, but the underlying mechanisms require investigation. This study assessed the retention of polypropylene microplastics in mouse liver and determined the intercorrelations between hepatic lipid fluctuations and transcriptomic changes. Microplastic-induced liver dysfunction was confirmed by the variations of transamination, cholesterol metabolism, biotransformation, and redox state. Chronic high-dose treatment induced distinct pathological changes, including regional fibrotic remodeling and ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities. Raman biospectra of liver slice proposed vital peaks of 1060, 1132, 1168, 1340, 1446, 1618, and 1670 cm–1, representing the liver biomolecule landscapes. Transcriptomic changes were mainly involved in mRNA transcription, multicellular organism development, various stimuli response, cell differentiation, and lipid metabolic process. Microplastic exposure dosage exerted more profound effects than exposure duration on gene expressions of oxidation–reduction process, signal transduction, and lipid metabolism. WGCNA analysis proposed 47 hub genes involved gene expression orchestration, cell fate monitor, and mitochondria translation modulation. Nine differentially expressed genes associated with lipid biomarkers were related to mitochondria transcription (Mrps12 and Mrpl53), cell differentiation (Bbc3, Lrrc15 and Gdf15), lipid catabolism (Etnppl and lipg) and tRNA methyltransferase (Trmt112), and Raman peak at 1670 cm–1 intimately connected with aggregated forms of protein. Our findings suggested that polypropylene microplastics could change the liver molecular landscape and induce lipid metabolism disorders and transcriptomic changes in mitochondrial protein translation and expression regulation, highlighting their significant consequences in nutrient and energy imbalance."

Air pollution might modulate the microRNA (miRNA) content of neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NdEVs), potentially mirroring brain epigenetic alterations. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between air pollution, NdEV miRNAs, and MDD severity in a population of 200 patients with depression. After signing informed consent, participants compiled questionnaires about demographics, lifestyle and clinical history, and donated a blood sample. MDD severity was assessed by five scales. Particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure was assigned based on participants’ residential address. Plasma NdEVs were obtained by L1CAM immunocapture. NdEV miRNAs were queried by RT-qPCR (microarray) following a two-stage approach. Associations between air pollutants, NdEV miRNAs, and MDD severity were assessed by multivariable regression models. The regulatory function of NdEV miRNAs was investigated by gene target and pathway analysis. As a result, exposure to NO2 was associated with decreased levels of miR-191 and miR-24, while PM2.5 was negatively associated with miR-191, miR-223, miR-24, miR-320, miR-451, miR-572, and miR-638. Decreased miR-126, miR-19b, miR-320, miR-451, miR-572, and miR-638 were associated with higher MDD severity scores. Target genes at the interface between air pollution exposure and MDD severity were mainly involved in inflammation and cell cycle regulation.

While regulatory bodies deem these chemicals unlikely to pose significant risks, emerging evidence highlights their potential neurotoxic effects. In this study, we evaluated the neurodevelopmental toxicity of TBBPA and TBBPA-BHEE in zebrafish embryos exposed to nonlethal (94–470 μg/L for TBBPA, 610–2030 μg/L for TBBPA-BHEE) and environmentally relevant concentrations (0.094–0.47 μg/L for TBBPA, 0.061–0.203 μg/L for TBBPA-BHEE) for up to 120 h postfertilization (hpf). Our findings show that at nonlethal concentrations, both TBBPA and TBBPA-BHEE impaired craniofacial development, induced apoptosis, reduced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and disrupted motor behavior, with significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in GABAergic signaling and synaptic plasticity. Transcriptomic and miRNA profiling revealed that downregulation of GABA receptor genes and miRNAs (e.g., let-7i, miR-192,) contributed to neurodevelopmental defects through disruption of CREB signaling and synaptogenesis. In contrast, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations induced similar phenotypes (craniofacial malformations and apoptosis) without major changes in neurotransmitter levels, suggesting that low-dose neurotoxicity might be mediated by alternative, less understood mechanisms, possibly involving epigenetic modifications or compensatory neuronal adaptations. These findings underscore the complexity of low-dose toxicity and the need for further research into the molecular pathways underlying the neurotoxic effects of TBBPA and its derivatives, particularly at environmentally relevant concentrations."

However, the effects of ozone exposure on the human microbiome remain unclear. This study conducted a controlled, randomized, crossover ozone exposure trial with 29 participants exposed to filtered air and ozone. Oral microbiome samples were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing. A mixed-effects model was used to analyze the impact of ozone exposure on the diversity and composition of the oral microbiome, as well as their association with lung functions. The results showed that the ozone concentration remained stable at 5 ± 5.1 parts per billion (ppb) under filtered air and 282.2 ± 44 ppb during ozone exposure. Acute ozone exposure significantly impaired lung function and reduced oral microbiome diversity, with forced vital capacity (FVC) decreasing by 0.41 L, expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) by 0.36 L, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) by 0.81 L, while observed species richness (Sobs), abundance-based coverage estimator (Ace), and chao indices (Chao) decreased by 21.83, 22.24, and 21.87%, respectively. Males exhibited greater sensitivity to ozone exposure than females, reflected in both reduced lung function and alterations in the oral microbiome. The altered microbiome was mainly enriched in metabolic pathways. Among the microbiome, Treponema medium exhibited a significant correlation and mediating effect on ozone-induced lung function impairment, which may serve as a sensitive indicator of changes in lung function. These findings provide new insights into the health effects caused by ozone exposure."

The contributions of ferroptosis and pyroptosis were recently reported in the progression of hepatic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the possible role of ferroptosis and pyroptosis in PM2.5-induced hepatocyte toxicity in LO2 cells (25, 50, or 100 μg/mL, 24 h) and liver injury in mice (10 mg/kg, intranasal administration, twice a week for 15 times). Our results revealed that PM2.5 induced a dose-related cytotoxic effect on LO2 cells and mouse liver injuries as well as increased activities of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. These findings were accompanied by Fe2+ accumulation, resulting from iron transport system disruption and ferritinophagy activation. The excess free Fe2+ induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, glutathione (GSH) depletion, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity loss, differential regulation of Nrf2 pathway elements, decreasing expression of the GPX4 protein, increasing expression of PTGS2 and ACSL4 genes and lipid peroxides, and finally initiation of ferroptosis. Along with tissue inflammation, overexpression of HMGB1 and proinflammatory cytokines, hepatocyte pyroptosis as indicated by cellular pyroptotic characteristics, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and Gasdermin D cleavage were also induced by PM2.5. The mitigating effects of deferoxamine on the above effects suggested ferroptosis and pyroptosis and the subsequent inflammation responses as potential mechanisms underlying PM2.5-induced liver toxicity. These results demonstrated that PM2.5 induced inflammation-associated hepatocyte toxicity and liver injury via the activation of ferroptosis and pyroptosis caused by iron accumulation-triggered oxidative stress. Our study revealed the potential role of different programmed cell death patterns in PM2.5-induced hepatic toxicity."

However, precise mechanisms underlying the impact of pathogenic bacteria on respiratory health remain poorly understood, and their primary target cells in respiratory tract have not been identified. We systematically explored cytotoxicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) on the whole epithelial cell lines representing different segments of the respiratory tract, including HNEpC (nasal mucosa), NP69 (nasopharynx), 16HBE (bronchus), and Beas-2B (lung) cells. By tracing the entire process of exposure to P. aeruginosa, NP69 cells emerged as the primary target, with HNEpC cells showing the lowest susceptibility among the four respiratory cell types. P. aeruginosa was transmitted from extracellular space to intracellular region of NP69 cells, accompanied by significant up-regulation (1.5–26.5 fold) of NOD2 expression, an RNA molecule that specifically binds to bacterial cell walls. Furthermore, cell proliferation activity decreased by 6.8%–46.1%, while levels of inflammatory cytokine interleukin IL-6 and IL-1β increased by 14.5%–181.0% and 50.2%–238.2%, respectively, following intracellular transition of bacteria in NP69 cells. The changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker expression at genetic and protein levels and enhancement of functional phenotypes (migratory capacity) confirmed the potential of P. aeruginosa to induce malignant transformation of epithelial cells by activating the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. This comprehensive examination of comparative cytotoxicity of bacteria on cells throughout the human respiratory tract elucidates specific target cells and damage mechanisms, offering valuable insights into health risk assessment, risk prevention, and bacteria control."

Our results indicated that Dibutyl phosphate (DBP), Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (BEHP), Bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP), Diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), and Bis(2-methylphenyl) phosphate (BMPP) exposure were significantly associated with increased levels of 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Household heating status had a modifying effect on these associations. Generalized additive mixed models revealed potential linear and nonlinear associations between OPEs and oxidative stress markers. The quantile g-computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression further found positive effects of OPEs mixtures on 8-OHdG, 8-OHG, and MDA. Weighted distribution analyses identified BEHP as a potentially contributing component affecting oxidative stress. These findings not only illuminate the health hazards of OPE exposures but also aid in understanding the link between OPEs and adverse health outcomes in older adults."

Exposome-based analyses utilizing biological samples have been conducted in various countries to assess the impacts of environmental endocrine disruptors and other pollutants on maternal and fetal health during pregnancy, particularly in developed countries. However, large-scale cohort studies that comprehensively cover major maternal and fetal diseases during pregnancy to explore the environmental and genetic interactions affecting maternal and fetal health are still lacking in China.

It is critical to prioritize potential obesogenic factors and systematically profile their modes of action. Here, based on adverse outcome pathway networks (AONs), we established a machine learning screening system that integrated three adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) to describe the mechanisms of chemical-induced obesity for thousands of chemicals. Notably, optimal AON-informed machine learning models achieved an accuracy above 0.95 and identified amide, aromatic/polycyclic, and nitrogen-containing structures as obesity-related. In addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were identified as prime candidate obesogens, inducing metabolic syndrome by interfering with all three signaling pathways across the AONs. Representative obesogens predicted in this study, such as antibiotics, insecticide metabolites, and exogenous chemical glucagon, were found to predominantly target membrane, mitochondrial, and nuclear receptor signaling pathways, respectively. Furthermore, top-prioritized chemicals (such as phenanthrene, azithromycin, 1,8,9-trihydroxyanthracene, etc.) according to ranking scores were randomly selected for experimental verification, and all selected candidates exhibited pathway interference in activating specific molecular initiating events (MIEs), demonstrating the predictive model’s accuracy.

While they are generally not classified as persistent organic pollutants due to their relatively rapid metabolism and urinary excretion, a fraction can accumulate in tissues, including the adipose. This bioaccumulation raises concerns about the potential for prolonged endocrine disruption and chronic toxicity. This study investigated the distribution and accumulation of nine BPs in human blood, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). By comparing the detection rates and concentrations of BPs in paired blood and adipose samples, we found that certain BPs (particularly BPF, BPE, and BPA-G) exhibit preferential accumulation in adipose tissues. The accumulation propensity was slightly higher in SAT than in VAT. Correlation analysis revealed that the sources of the same BP in VAT and SAT were highly consistent, whereas most BPs in adipose tissues had significantly different sources compared with those in blood. Further analysis suggested that age and obesity might be key factors influencing the differential accumulation of BPs in adipose tissues. Since accumulated BPs can be slowly or substantially released during lipolysis, our findings highlight that the adipose tissue reservoir of BPs may play an important role in their long-term toxic effects."

Plasma samples were tested with an untargeted metabolomic analysis. Meteorological data was collected from China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System. The three consecutive months with the highest monthly average temperatures of the whole year were defined as summer. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the multiple linear regression model were used to assess the effects of summer mean temperature exposure on blood metabolomics, followed by stratified analysis by sex.

Metabolomic analysis identified 54 altered metabolites related to summer mean temperature, of which 7 altered metabolites were enriched in 4 significant metabolic pathways (p < 0.05), which were mainly involved in amino acid and peptide compound metabolism. Stratified analysis results showed that in addition to amino acid metabolism, summer mean temperature exposure also disrupted vitamin metabolism in females. Summer mean temperature could possibly be associated with altered metabolic pathways such as amino acid metabolism, causing inflammation and oxidative stress damage. Females could be more susceptible to summer temperature in terms of disrupted vitamin metabolism."

However, the toxicological effects of CTPs, particularly on pulmonary health, remain poorly understood. This study investigates the impact of long-term CTPs exposure at environmentally relevant doses on lung cells and animal models. In vitro experiments revealed that CTPs exposure impaired mitochondrial function in BEAS-2B cells in a time-dependent manner. Proteomic analysis demonstrated significant alterations in oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins, disrupting the electron transport chain (ETC). Untargeted metabolomics further revealed disruptions in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutathione metabolism, and purine metabolism, with notably decreased levels of key metabolites. Multiomics integration suggested potential associations between high-dose CTPs exposure and diseases including lipoyltransferase 1 deficiency, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia. In vivo studies confirmed pathological lung damage in mice, including alveolar destruction and pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, downregulation of N-lauroylsphingosine (NLDP) was identified as a potential metabolic biomarker for CTPs-induced lung injury, offering novel insights for mitigating CTPs’ adverse effects.

A Cox proportional hazard model was applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval per interquartile range increment in UFP concentrations. Long-term exposure to ambient UFP was associated with a 3% higher incidence risk of overall CVD (95% CI: 1–4%). Significant positive associations were observed for several specific CVDs, including chronic rheumatic heart diseases, hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, conduction disorders, heart failure, and cerebrovascular diseases (HRs: 1.03–1.09), while others showed no association. These associations were generally robust to adjustment of other air pollutants including PM2.5. The exposure–response relationship curves were generally linear without thresholds. This large prospective study suggests that UFP is an independent, modifiable CVD risk factor, distinct from PM2.5, relevant even for populations distant from major emission sources.

This study demonstrates that developmental exposure to mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP: 0, 10, and 50 mg/kg), the bioactive metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), induced neurobehavioral deficits in adolescent offspring rats. Behavioral assessments revealed that the MEHP exposure provoked anxiety-like behaviors at postnatal days (PND) 14 and 21, concurrently manifested as spatial memory impairments at PND35. Histopathological analysis demonstrated significant neurodegenerative alterations in the hippocampus of MEHP-exposed offspring, including reduced Nissl body density in the 50 mg/kg group. Transcriptomic profiling identified a robust dose-dependent dysregulation pattern, with high-dose exposure (50 mg/kg) eliciting substantially more differentially expressed genes (542 DEGs) than low-dose exposure (393 DEGs). Analysis revealed suppression of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways, characterized by the downregulation of Cyp2a1, Cyp2f4, Cyp2g1, and Cyp1a2. Strikingly, these effects occurred independently of canonical xenobiotic-sensing receptors, indicating direct CYP450 transcriptional inhibition as a potential novel mechanism.

This study evaluates global Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) extremeness and climate linkages using GRACE and GRACE‐FO data from 2002 to 2024. By examining upper and lower deciles of TWS anomalies representing wet and dry extremes and assessing spatial dependencies, we identify key patterns, trends, and driving factors through dimensional reduction and probabilistic modeling. Results show global TWS extremes are governed by a 2–3‐year oscillatory cycle linked to El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which synchronizes drought and pluvial conditions across continents. Drought extremes show broader spatial coherence than pluvial events, indicating moisture deficits propagate more uniformly through the land–atmosphere system. A weaker quasi‐decadal cycle (6–10 years) modulates these responses and underlies a shift around 2011–2012. Before 2011, wet extremes intensified, while after 2012, dry extremes became dominant, particularly in interior Asia, western United States, and southern Africa. Neither pluvial nor drought extremes show significant global trends in intensity; however, they remain phase‐locked, with wet events twice as intense as dry ones, reflecting asymmetric hydrologic response to moisture surpluses versus deficits. We probabilistically reconstruct TWS extremeness during satellite data gaps using leading spatio‐temporal patterns. The current record, spanning less than one multidecadal cycle, remains insufficient for robust attribution. Extending satellite gravimetry is essential to refine uncertainty in attributing global pluvial and drought extremes under climate change."

These potentially tsunamigenic seafloor offsets result from coseismic fault slip and deformation beneath or within the accretionary wedge. The mechanics of these shallow rupture phenomena and their dependence on subduction zone properties remain unresolved, partly due to the sparsity of offshore observations of shallow megathrust earthquake deformation. Here, we analyze how offshore structure influences shallow rupture mechanics and slip partitioning using 3D dynamic earthquake simulations of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) megathrust with and without variably dipping seaward‐ or landward‐vergent splay faults in the wedge that sole into the megathrust. Resulting tradeoffs between splay and megathrust slip reveal structural controls on rupture partitioning, with greater splay slip leading to less shallow megathrust slip updip. Gently dipping and seaward‐vergent splays host more slip than those with steeper, landward‐vergent splays. To isolate the underlying mechanisms, we compare models with Andersonian and plunging principal stresses. Results suggest distinct static and dynamic processes control the dip‐ and vergence‐dependence of splay rupture: static (mis)alignment relative to far‐field tectonic loading favors slip on more optimally oriented, shallowly dipping splay faults. In contrast, dynamic stress interactions of an updip‐propagating megathrust rupture front with the free surface and potential branch faults favor forward branching onto seaward‐vergent splays and inhibit backward branching onto landward‐vergent splays. Resulting seafloor displacements suggest splay fault structure may influence coseismic tsunami source processes, highlighting the importance of dynamically viable rupture scenarios in subduction hazard assessments."

Understanding of past extremes and their meaningfulness for contextualizing future possibilities, especially in the near‐term, is limited by the absence of a global analysis focused on the most extreme humid‐heat‐anomaly events. Here we identify record‐setting humid‐heat days for 216 global regions and assess the likelihood of these records being broken even under present‐day climate forcing. We use several reanalyses as a historical catalogue, and large climate‐model ensembles to represent other statistically plausible events. Unlike the spatial pattern of large temperature anomalies, we find that humid‐heat anomalies are most intense, and most seasonally and interannually concentrated, in the deep tropics and arid subtropics. Many top events have attracted little if any prior attention. The eastern United States is especially susceptible to record‐breaking humid heat due to modest current records (>1% inferred annual exceedance probability) contrasting with numerous simulated large‐anomaly days. Australia and eastern China are also prone to locally exceptional episodes, with >40% of ensemble members simulating events exceeding the ERA5‐based distribution maximum. Model biases for key characteristics, together with the observed record‐setting day affecting its estimated return period by >2.5x in half of regions, underline several valuable aspects of a joint observation/model perspective on humid heat. This approach aids in evaluating the plausibility of as‐yet‐unseen extremes; identifying regions of concern that might otherwise be overlooked and underprepared; and gauging regionally specific correlations between event magnitudes and societal impacts."

Although the combined effects of stressors are recognized, the manner in which the prestress state determines the basic response mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used the “natural experiment” methodology to compare two major extreme events within a monsoon‐influenced, low‐latitude highlands setting to explain mechanistic changes in land‐atmosphere interactions. By analyzing an extensive set of remote sensing and reanalysis data with nonlinear structural equation modeling, we show that the ecosystem response shifted from a traditional water‐limited paradigm during the 2010 drought to an energy‐governed paradigm during the 2019 heatwave. Our results suggest that this transition is governed by the antecedent root zone soil moisture status, which acts as a tipping point fundamentally shifting the impact of atmospheric factors on canopy evapotranspiration screens, such as temperature and vapor pressure deficit.

However, these processes do not always produce surface manifestations and may sometimes elude detection by current geological and geodetic monitoring. Here we monitor subsurface seismic velocity changes across Kīlauea's system from 2013 to 2018 and integrate these observations with concurrent measurements of ground deformation and lava lake elevation. We corroborate years‐long seismic velocity decreases around the summit caldera, which are particularly pronounced at southern stations, consistent with sustained pressurization of the South Caldera reservoir (SCR) from a deep magma supply. Following the 2015 summit intrusion, accelerated rates of velocity decrease, summit inflation, and lava lake rise suggest an increased magma supply to the SCR. Notably, we identify an anomalous 7‐month period (late 2016–mid 2017) of disrupted magma/pressure transfer between the SCR and Halema'uma'u magma reservoir (HMR), as evidenced by dropping lava lake levels despite continued summit inflation and SCR pressurization. This period coincided with pressurization observed beneath Pu'u'ō'ō, indicating pressure/magma diversion from the summit toward the ERZ and the episode terminated with a M5.3 flank earthquake in June 2017 that restored the connectivity between the SCR and HMR and triggered shallow crustal pressurization beneath the summit caldera for the subsequent 2–3 months. Our findings reveal significant perturbations in Kīlauea's magmatic plumbing system approximately one year before the catastrophic 2018 eruption, highlighting seismic velocity monitoring's value for detecting subtle changes of the volcano."

Feltham,The Arctic Ocean Double Estuary: Quantification and Forcing Mechanisms,"The Arctic Ocean double estuary is a “three‐legged” overturning system in which inflowing waters are converted into both lighter and denser waters before being exported equatorwards. As the northern terminus of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), it thus both affects, and is affected by, the Atlantic MOC. Here we quantify the magnitudes of the two overturning cells in density space, and then decompose the water mass transformation rates into net pan‐Arctic contributions from surface forcing and diapycnal mixing. We use a high‐resolution, quasi‐synoptic ice and ocean hydrographic data set spanning the four main Arctic Ocean gateways—Fram, Davis and Bering Straits, and the Barents Sea Opening. Two surface flux reanalyses and a hydrographic climatology are used to generate estimates of surface water mass transformation rates by density class. A box model then determines the profiles of turbulent mixing transformation rates, and associated turbulent diffusivities. We show that turbulent mixing and surface forcing drive transformations of similar magnitudes, while mixing dominates in the upper cell and surface fluxes in the lower cell. Consideration of uncertainties and timescales leads to the tentative suggestion that our results might be representative of recent decades. We discuss the possible significance of tides and sea ice brine rejection as energy sources driving turbulent mixing. Finally, we speculate as to whether water mass transformation rates may change in future as ocean heat transport into the Arctic increases. As sea ice declines and the efficiency of atmosphere‐to‐ocean momentum transfer increases, the Arctic Ocean is expected to “spin up,” causing more intense turbulent mixing, with uncertain consequences."

However, emission data for particulate halogens from industrial sources remain incomplete, which hinders advances in atmospheric chemistry modeling. In this study, we analyzed the atmospheric emissions of halogens in fine particulate matter samples collected from 112 full‐scale industrial plants across 13 sectors. The results show that municipal solid‐waste incineration exhibited the highest concentrations of total particulate halogen and particulate chlorine (pCl). Iron‐ore sintering showed the highest concentrations of particulate fluorine (pF) and particulate bromine (pBr). Using the emission factor method, we identified cement kilns co‐processing solid waste and iron‐ore sintering as the most significant emission sources, with annual emissions of p(F + Cl + Br) reaching 32,785 and 6,155 t, respectively. Eastern China had significantly higher emissions of p(F + Cl + Br) than other regions. Furthermore, emissions across provinces were generally higher during the cold season than in warmer seasons. This pattern underscores the need for enhanced emission reduction and control measures targeting these major sources and critical periods."

 Hunner-type interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (HIC) is a debilitating condition defined by bladder pain and urinary urgency, yet its upstream drivers remain poorly understood. To identify upstream mechanisms that exacerbate urothelial injury, here we apply an integrative multi-omics framework combining metagenomic sequencing, targeted metabolomics of urine and serum, and single-cell RNA sequencing. This approach reveals a microbial signature enriched in Enterococcus avium and a marked alteration in bile acid metabolism, including increased taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA). Single-cell analysis indicates that these changes converge on Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation in urothelial cells. Further validations show that a microbiota–bile acid–TLR3 axis disrupts epithelial barrier integrity and triggers inflammatory responses in experimental models. Transplantation and metabolite administration confirm the causal role of E. avium and TCDCA, while TLR3 inhibition ameliorates injury. These findings uncover an upstream pathway linking gut-derived metabolites to bladder pathology and suggest opportunities for biomarker development and targeted therapies for HIC. Through integrated multi-omics and experimental validation, this study reveals that altered gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism activate TLR3 to induce urothelial injury in interstitial cystitis, identifying a pathway with therapeutic potential."

Here, the authors show that MoFlow integrates multi-omic data to infer locally adaptive, single-cell-resolved velocities that illuminate fine-scale regulatory dynamics. 
 Cell fate transitions emerge from dynamic gene expression programs, yet existing RNA velocity models primarily rely on RNA abundance and globally inferred latent time, limiting their ability to capture local regulatory dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce MoFlow, a deep neural network that integrates multi-omic data within a relay velocity framework. Unlike previous approaches, MoFlow flexibly infers velocity parameters at single-cell resolution without pre-assigned latent time, enabling a comprehensive and locally adaptive estimation of gene expression kinetics. Applied to single cell multi-omic datasets from brain, skin, and blood cells, MoFlow distinguished chromatin-dependent and independent transcriptional regulation, validated transcription repression models, and identified asynchronous gene repression in neural progenitors. It also uncovered transcriptional activation of DNA damage response genes in radial glia with distinct subnuclear localization. By resolving fine-grained regulatory programs, MoFlow advances the interpretability and precision of RNA velocity analysis beyond the limits of existing models.

 Cancer detection is challenging, especially in patients with diffuse symptoms that overlap with non-malignant conditions. Here we show that plasma protein profiling can identify cancer among patients with non-specific symptoms. Using proximity extension assay-based proteomics of 1463 plasma proteins from 456 patients presenting with non-specific symptoms sampled prior to cancer diagnostic work-up and diagnosis, we identify 29 proteins associated with new cancer diagnoses. We develop a model able to stratify 160 cancer cases and 296 non-cancer cases with an area under the curve of 0.80, maintaining performance (0.82) in an independent replication cohort of 238 patients. The model also distinguishes cancer from autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases. Designed as a triage tool, our model based on a blood test could help prioritize patients at higher cancer risk for rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic modalities such as positron emission tomography–computed tomography.

 Time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS) is a powerful technique for probing quasiparticle interactions in quantum materials under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we implement tr-RIXS at the carbon K-edge to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of core excitons coupled to vibrational modes in graphite. Using femtosecond X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser, we monitor the temporal evolution of vibronically dressed excitons and their interaction with symmetry-selective optical phonons. By tuning the incident photon energy across the 1s → σ* resonance and analyzing the integrated inelastic sideband intensity, we reveal a detuning-controlled crossover between two complementary dynamical regimes. Phenomenological modeling and first-principles calculations reproduce both the magnitude and detuning dependence of the spectral-weight changes. In this work, enabled by the unique capabilities of X-ray free-electron lasers, we demonstrate how tr-RIXS can access coupled electronic and lattice dynamics with elemental and symmetry specificity, opening new routes to control vibronic interactions in light-element and low-dimensional quantum materials.

Here, the authors show that γδ T cell activation in response to CD1d differs from that of αβ T cells and determine the structure of a γδ T cell receptor that binds to CD1d independently of the presented lipid. 
 The monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule CD1d presents lipid antigens to both αβ and γδ T cells. While type I natural killer T cells (NKT) display exquisite specificity for CD1d presenting α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), the extent of lipid specificity exhibited by CD1d-restricted γδ T cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human γδ T cell receptors (TCRs) can recognise CD1d in either a lipid-dependent or lipid-independent manner with weak to moderate affinity. Using small-angle X-Ray scattering, we find that γδ TCR-CD1d binding modality is conserved across distinct CD1d-restricted TCRs. In functional assays, CD1d γδ TCR affinity was a poor predictor of γδ T cell line activation. Moreover, CD1d presenting endogenous lipids was sufficient to stimulate T cell activation and induce γδ TCR-CD3 clustering and phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Elongation of the γδ TCR-CD3 complex by the inclusion of the Cγ2 and Cγ3 -encoded constant domains perturbed cellular activation whilst maintaining the ability to form functional γδ TCR clusters. The crystal structure of a Vδ1 γδ+ TCR-CD1d complex showed that the γδ TCR sat atop of the CD1d antigen-binding cleft but made no contacts with the presented lipid antigen. These findings provide a molecular basis for lipid-independent CD1d recognition by γδ TCRs. T cells can recognise lipid antigen in the context of CD1d molecules.

 Layered dielectric materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer high potential for next-generation two-dimensional (2D) electronic devices, but materials that combine a wide bandgap and high dielectric constant are rare. Here, we present the controllable synthesis of quasi-vdW layered samarium oxysulfate (Sm2O2SO4) single crystals via a molten-salt-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. These atomically thin crystals exhibit remarkable dielectric properties, including a wide bandgap (~5.54 eV), high dielectric constant (~18), robust breakdown voltage (>12 MV cm-1) and good thermal reliability. By integrating ultrathin Sm2O2SO4 nanoplates with 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) via vdW forces, we fabricate field-effect transistors (FETs) showing a subthreshold swing down to 65.2 mV dec-1, hysteresis down to 5.4 mV, on/off current ratios of ~109, and gate leakage currents down to around 7 × 10-7 A cm-2.

 Adiabatic topological pumping offers a robust mechanism for light transport in integrated photonics, enabling the development of efficient on-chip photonic devices. However, its practical implementations face significant challenges in maintaining both high transport efficiency and scalability due to slow adiabatic modulation requirements, and existing acceleration strategies fall short in achieving substantial device miniaturization. Here, we develop a gap-mode strategy for constructing shortcut to topological pumping, and experimentally demonstrate a superadiabatic paradigm through iterative adiabatic transformations in an on-chip photonic platform. Our approach achieves a 20-fold footprint reduction compared to conventional adiabatic pumping and a 50% size reduction relative to optimized Landau-Zener (as well as recently reported quantum metric and adiabatic infimum) implementations. The device operates over a remarkable bandwidth of 650–920 nm while facilitating scalable waveguide integration.

 The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinically important bacterial pathogens has severely compromised the effectiveness of commonly used antibiotics in healthcare. Acquisition and transmission of AMR genes (ARGs) are often facilitated by sublethal concentrations of antibiotics in microbially dense environments. In this study, we use sewage samples (n = 381) collected from six Indian states between June and December 2023 to assess the concentration of eleven antibiotics, microbial diversity, and ARG richness. We find antibiotics from seven drug classes and detect over 2000 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Metagenomic (n = 220) and isolated genome sequences (n = 305) of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species identify 82 ARGs associated with 80 mobile genetic elements (MGEs). These MGEs are predominantly present in multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens. Comparative core genome analysis of MDR bacterial isolates (n = 7166) shows strong genetic similarity between sewage-derived strains and clinical pathogens. Our results highlight sewage as a significant reservoir for ARGs, where genetic exchanges occur and facilitate the evolution and spread of AMR pathogens in both community and healthcare settings. Additionally, the dipstick-based assay developed for ARGs detection can be used for sewage surveillance in low-resource settings for better understanding of resistance prevalence.

 Streamflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin, USA has decreased proportionally more than precipitation in the recent multi-decadal drought. The causes are debated. Understanding how precipitation, and seasonal temperature, vegetation, and evapotranspiration dynamics affect streamflow is essential. Here we use causal inference with historical data to identify surface runoff efficiency drivers. Runoff efficiency increases in years with higher precipitation and snow accumulation accompanied by cooler spring temperatures and delayed vegetation phenology, which generally attenuates biomass accumulation. Conversely, runoff efficiency decreases in years with lower precipitation and snow accumulation, or warmer springs, when vegetation activity and productivity are accelerated or amplified. Summer temperature, often identified as a driver of higher evaporation and aridity, does not emerge as statistically significant. Years with extreme phases of winter-spring precipitation have distinct atmospheric circulation patterns and associated sea surface temperatures, indicating the influence of larger-scale climate drivers on the Basin’s precipitation and runoff efficiency dynamics. Statistical causal inference shows that runoff efficiency in the Upper Colorado River Basin rises with higher precipitation and snow, accompanied by cooler springs and suppressed vegetation, and falls when precipitation and snow are lower and accompanied by warmer springs and enhanced vegetation."

 Spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has been widely demonstrated as an effective method for ocean wind speed retrieval. This study explores the feasibility of using track-wise GNSS-R wind products to generate gap-free wind fields. A physics-informed neural mapping scheme, 4DVarNet, is adapted to reconstruct wind fields. Results indicate that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the 1-hour, 3-hour, and 6-hour 4DVarNet winds are 1.13 m/s, 1.16 m/s, and 1.24 m/s compared to European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 wind products, while 1.40 m/s, 1.41 m/s, and 1.48 m/s are referred to Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) all-weather winds. Spatial and temporal error analyses further confirm the robustness of 4DVarNet-derived winds, with daily RMSEs remaining below 1.6 m/s. Error decomposition reveals discrepancies between ECMWF and GNSS-R winds, which may support future recalibration of GNSS-R wind products or enhancements to ECMWF forecasts. A case study of Super Typhoon Surigae proves that 4DVarNet winds closely align with the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) track data. The reconstructed winds detect the peak intensity temporally consistent with IBTrACS data, whereas ECMWF forecasts exhibit a two-day lag. Moreover, asymmetries in Tropical Storm Kompasu are observed, with the radius of maximum wind (Rmax) over the Northeast quadrant 38% larger than that over the Northwest quadrant. Despite the absence of background wind field inputs, 4DVarNet effectively learns wind patterns from ECMWF data and integrates GNSS-R observations to generate gap-free wind mappings, exhibiting strong agreement with ECMWF wind fields. The reconstruction performance is degraded at high winds due to the underestimation of referenced ECMWF ERA5 winds and the small quantity of observations. This limitation could be alleviated through denser GNSS-R observations from multiple missions such as Fengyun-3, Tianmu-1, recently launched HydroGNSS, etc., and other training references with more high winds for improving the representation of 4DVarNet at high winds."

 Advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, along with point cloud modeling techniques like Quantitative Structure Models (QSM), have improved the accuracy of non-destructive above-ground tree biomass estimation. However, branch-level tree growth analysis using QSM time series remains underexplored due to challenges in data quality and methodology. This study investigates the boundary conditions in terms of data and species to facilitate robust QSM generation, which could enable branch-level growth analysis using multi-temporal LiDAR data and QSM. A multi-scan terrestrial laser scanning dataset and a dataset from a tower-based system were used to assess the impact of data acquisition setup and data quality on QSM reconstruction for birch (Betula pendula), pines (Pinus sylvestris), and spruces (Picea abies). The results show that reliable QSMs for detecting branch-level growth require a minimum spatial resolution of approximately 500 pts./m3 with a uniform point density, a maximum uniform 3D point distance of 2 cm, and gaps smaller than around 20 cm. Although smaller spherical noise clusters can be removed using denoising techniques, larger and denser noise clusters (e.g., > 9500 points within 1 m radius) are more likely to be misidentified as additional branches. Foliage removal methods risk modeling accuracy by inadvertently removing woody points. Regarding species, birches were more accurately modeled than pines and spruces. While QSMs are reproducible for single time points, comparing branches over time is challenging due to inconsistencies in modeled branching order and scanner positioning. Nonetheless, tree-level QSM metrics remain statistically consistent, revealing diverse growth strategies within and across species."

 Streetlights are essential infrastructure in cities. They enhance traffic and public safety at night, but they also entail significant energy consumption. The study of the density, quantity and distribution of streetlights is essential for sustainable urban development. The Sustainable Development Global Scientific Satellite-1 has enriched night-time light data. This study is based on the Crowded Scene Recognition Network (CSRNet) and proposes a novel Streetlight Counting Network (SLCNet) by introducing a deeper front-end network and adding a spatial attention mechanism. This model can effectively estimate the density distribution of streetlights within a region and achieve automatic counting of large-scale streetlight numbers. Experimental results show that SLCNet achieves a mean absolute error of 135.35, a root mean square error of 231.37, and a normalised absolute error of 0.22, representing reductions of 5.60 %, 8.08 %, and 12.00 % respectively outperforming the original CSRNet model. The visualisation results also show that SLCNet predicts the distribution of streetlight density more accurately than CSRNet. Comprehensive ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each improvement method. Compared with the high-resolution yet costly Jilin-1 night-time images, SLCNet maintains comparable accuracy while enabling large-scale streetlight density and quantity estimation with publicly accessible SDGSAT-1 images. This study demonstrates the application potential of SDGSAT-1 in urban night-time lighting monitoring, providing new technical pathways and research frameworks for urban lighting management, sustainable development assessment, and smart city construction."

 Sea ice type information is important for climate change research and human activities in polar regions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, particularly from the Sentinel-1 (S1) mission, has become a key source for high-resolution sea ice mapping. With the growing volume of S1 SAR data, deep learning (DL) methods have been explored for sea ice classification. However, the limited availability of fine labels and overlapping backscatter intensity among ice types remain major obstacles to achieving automated fine-scale sea ice classification across the pan-Arctic region. This paper proposes a model, named IceDeepLab, for the automatic mapping of sea ice type across the pan-Arctic region in winter using S1 dual-polarized SAR images, based on the Deep Learning framework DeepLabv3+. The IceDeepLab can identify open water, young ice, first-year ice and old ice, generating pixel-wise classification maps at 400 m resolution. A sea ice type dataset, comprising 174 finely labelled S1 images from November 2019 to March 2020 and covering the pan-Arctic region with diverse sea ice conditions, is established for model training and validation. In particular, radar incidence angle is included as an input to mitigate its effects on HH-polarized SAR data. The model integrates the spatially optimised ConvNeXt backbone, the newly proposed Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, and tailored training and inference schemes. These designs make it more suitable for processing whole SAR images, effectively reducing ambiguity between different sea ice types and eliminating stitching lines, thereby improving overall performance. Experiments on the test dataset show that IceDeepLab achieves an overall accuracy of 91.9%, a mean intersection over union of 82.3%, and a mean F1-score of 90.2%, significantly outperforming the traditional DeepLabv3+ by 16.0%, 10.0%, and 11.1%, respectively. When applied to 4153 S1 images collected from November 2020 to March 2021, IceDeepLab maintains over 90% agreement with operational ice charts in the pan-Arctic region, demonstrating the model's robustness across different years. Ablation experiments, feature visualizations, and statistical analyses further validate the model's effectiveness and offer insights for future improvements in sea ice classification algorithms. Furthermore, evaluations using both the radiometer-derived sea ice concentration product and a year-round ice type dataset are conducted to explore its potential for broader applications in operational sea ice monitoring."

 Sentinel-1 is a unique resource for global flood monitoring, providing systematic, weather-independent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with unprecedented coverage. To overcome limitations of on-demand flood mapping services that depend on human operators to collect and interpret satellite images, a fundamentally new approach was adopted by the Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) service. This service, which was launched in 2021 as part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), processes all Sentinel-1 land images acquired in VV polarisation fully automatically in near-real time. This article presents the first comprehensive analysis of GFM’s scientific achievements and challenges during its initial years of operation. To map floods reliably under diverse environmental conditions, GFM combines three complementary flood-mapping algorithms with reference water datasets to differentiate flooded areas from permanent and seasonal water bodies. The service also offers a novel flood-likelihood layer and contextual information to highlight areas where flood mapping is unreliable or not feasible. These data layers were derived from a global 20 m backscatter datacube containing approximately 379 billion land surface pixels. This datacube also made it possible to generate the first global Sentinel-1 flood archive (2015 to present). Our performance analysis shows that GFM typically delivers flood maps within five hours of image acquisition. However, a significant percentage of floods may go undetected due to coverage gaps. Initial evaluation results show that good accuracies are achieved for larger-scale floods and regions in the temperate and tropical zones, while accuracies are lower for smaller-scale floods and arid environments. The GFM service will continue to improve service quality by enhancing flood detection capabilities using improved algorithms and additional data, such as the VH channel from Sentinel-1 or L-band data from the upcoming ROSE-L mission."

 Soil moisture is a critical variable for hydrology, agriculture and climate. However, large-scale soil moisture observation remains difficult due to sparse in situ networks and the inability of optical sensors to capture it under cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions, e.g., Sentinel-1, yield unique all-weather, day and night observations with a fine spatial and temporal resolution that makes them of interest for development of global soil moisture monitoring. Consequently, this review discusses the application of C-band SAR observations from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission to estimate high-resolution near-surface soil moisture. First, the importance of SAR backscatter monitoring from Sentinel-1 is emphasized. Next, the current state-of-the-art in soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 is presented. Although considerable progress has been made in near-surface soil moisture retrieval, several limitations remain. Factors such as the effects of vegetation and surface roughness on the signal, sensor and scattering model limitations, spatial and temporal constraints, and uncertainties, e.g. in data assimilation, pose challenges to its usage. While Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based retrieval methods have shown promise, their interpretability, dependence on large datasets, vulnerability to data quality, and computational burden have been major challenges. Beyond methods that rely on backscatter, there have been recent works indicating that SAR interferometric observables have the potential to estimate soil moisture, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where these are particularly sensitive to moisture changes. To address these challenges, this paper recommends integrating Sentinel-1 with other satellite mission data for a multi-sensor data integration approach (e.g., Sentinel-2 and Soil Moisture Active Passive - SMAP data), refining physical and semi-empirical models, developing advanced AI techniques able to consider physical principles, and combining with emerging data from other high temporal resolution SAR missions (e.g., NASA-ISRO SAR). The review concludes with identification of key research priorities, including standardization of retrieval frameworks, improved validation efforts on standardized reference sets, and cloud processing for real-time user cases. Overall, the review provides a thorough foundation for understanding, refining, and advancing Sentinel-1 based soil moisture retrieval methods."

 Peatland restoration can halt biodiversity loss and organic soil degradation and mitigate climate change. Monitoring of restoration impacts requires novel approaches that can be scaled to large site networks. On a smaller scale, the restoration practitioners would likewise benefit from spatially and temporally comprehensive and objective monitoring data. This narrative review compiles potential remote sensing methods for practical monitoring of the ecohydrological processes in restoration of forestry-drained boreal peatlands to support and complement conventional ground monitoring approaches that are restricted by spatial coverage. Remote sensing provides tools for tracking the changes in soil surface moisture, water flow routes, vegetation cover and structure, topography, peat depth and greenhouse gas emissions. We emphasize that the suitable indicators of restoration success, platforms and sensors should be tailored to specific restoration cases with their own initial site conditions and restoration targets. The choice of spatial and temporal resolutions of data is defined by the scale and change rate of the restoration indicators. Data acquisition campaigns and selection of existing datasets require meticulous planning due to seasonal changes in hydrology and vegetation. We also compiled practical experiences on selecting remote sensing tools and ensuring satisfactory data quality to facilitate the implementation of remote-sensing-based monitoring. Finally, we provide recommendations on how the rapid development of remote sensing technology, encompassing new uncrewed applications and novel sensors on conventional platforms, can offer a range of monitoring tools to cater to the growing needs for spatially comprehensive data amounts assessing peatland restoration success in boreal conditions."

 Buried lakes are widely distributed on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) after summer. Some of these lakes may drain over winter, thereby delivering meltwater into the ice sheet and potentially influencing ice flow dynamics. However, to date, only a limited number of buried lake drainages (BLDs) have been identified and their spatiotemporal dynamics across the GrIS remain unclear. Here we detect pan-GrIS wintertime BLDs by integrating Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite imagery and ArcticDEM data. We begin by locating potential buried lakes with topographic depressions. Then we identify the depressions with significant wintertime backscatter increases as potential BLDs using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Next, we map the maximum summertime meltwater area using Sentinel-2 imagery and select the potential BLDs with sufficient summertime meltwater as final BLDs. Finally, we categorize these final BLDs into three types (complete BLDs, partial BLDs, and low-confidence BLDs), and we also investigate potential ice velocity anomalies (IVAs) triggered by BLDs using ice velocity data. The results show that: (1) 167 complete and partial BLDs are identified over seven winters from 2017 to 2023 on the GrIS, including 25 cascade drainages; their spatiotemporal distributions vary significantly, with most BLDs detected at the NW, CW, and SW basins in November. (2) Wintertime BLDs potentially trigger 10 significant IVAs (up to 50 %), and may lead to a net increase in annual ice motion. (3) Wintertime IVAs triggered by BLDs are significantly higher than summertime IVAs triggered by supraglacial lake drainages; they propagate downstream along subglacial hydrologic pathways rather than ice flowlines. (4) BLDs can even trigger rerouting of subglacial hydrologic pathways over a short time period. In conclusion, we present a new method of detecting sparse wintertime BLDs over large areas and reveal that BLDs have a more profound effect on ice flow dynamics than previously assumed."

 Multimodal remote sensing imagery has been widely used in many fields. However, in specific scenarios, it is challenging to acquire the key modality, making it difficult to extract the land cover mapping information in conditions of missing modalities. Existing missing modality learning methods transfer historical complete modal feature knowledge to single-modal features disrupting their feature distribution, and leading to poor performance in downstream tasks. To address the aforementioned issue, a multimodal remote sensing land cover dataset called EarthMiss is designed to simulate real-world missing modality scenarios. EarthMiss comprises 3355 pairs of 0.6-meter high-resolution Optical and SAR images collected from 13 cities spanning five continents, including 8 common types of land cover objects, making it the multimodal remote sensing dataset with the highest number of classes at this high resolution. Besides, a remote sensing meta modal representation framework named MetaRS is proposed for missing modality land cover mapping task. MetaRS presents a meta-modal aware module to extract modality-invariant features for missing modality feature recovery, and a meta-modal representation regularization training strategy to guide meta-modal focus on task-related feature representation. Specifically, we disentangle features by supervising the covariance matrix of multi-modal features, and knowledge transfer takes place solely, thereby ensuring the consistency of the transferred knowledge. Then, a meta-modal representation branch fuses the meta-features of all modalities and calculates the prediction loss for them. Comprehensive experiments conducted across EarthMiss dataset, four additional benchmarks, and a 2023 Libyan-flood case study demonstrate that MetaRS significantly surpasses existing methods, and provides a promising alternative for multimodal remote sensing applications.

 Near-real-time (NRT) daily crop monitoring at the field scale is crucial for precision agriculture, yet remains challenging due to limitations in the spatial or temporal resolution of existing remote sensing methods. While Sentinel-2 provides adequate spatial resolution for field-level applications, its temporal resolution is insufficient for capturing rapid crop dynamics, especially in cloudy regions. Existing spatiotemporal fusion techniques require multiple clear-sky images and lack true NRT capability, while ground-based sensors offer continuous monitoring but with limited spatial coverage. To address these limitations, this study develops the Near-Real-Time Ground-Satellite Fusion (NRT-GSF) algorithm, a novel approach based on a Bayesian dynamic linear model and Kalman filtering. The algorithm uniquely integrates Sentinel-2 imagery with continuous measurements from Internet of Things for Agriculture (IoTA) systems to generate daily 10-m Green Area Index (GAI) products. Its recursive framework supports both forward prediction in NRT mode following satellite overpasses and backward updating to refine historical profiles. Implemented over French wheat fields using 34 IoTA systems and Sentinel-2 time series from 2019, the algorithm effectively enhanced spatiotemporal completeness and accuracy (R = 0.75–0.98, RMSE = 0.1–0.49). A comprehensive leave-one-out Sentinel-2 evaluation demonstrated its superiority over the current Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO) algorithm. Ground validation using handheld RGB cameras further confirmed the accuracy of the GAI products from the new algorithm (RMSE = 0.5). The NRT-GSF framework offers a robust and operationally solution for daily, high-resolution crop GAI mapping in NRT mode, and it can be extended to other traits or applications in the near-real-time context."

 The accurate three-dimensional (3D) distribution of plant area density (PAD) within forests is crucial for understanding canopy structure and provides essential scene inputs for 3D Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) to facilitate remote sensing interpretation. However, current lidar-based voxelization methods that estimate detailed PAD distributions often cover limited areas, constraining their applications in conducting broad forest studies and interpreting Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) data of various scales and resolutions. To address this, we developed the Large-Scale Path Volume Leaf Area Density (LS-PVlad), a novel forest 3D reconstruction workflow capable of producing extensive high-resolution 3D voxelized forest scenes (up to 100 km2 with ≤2 m voxel size) from worldwide open-access airborne lidar scanning (ALS) data. By applying LS-PVlad to the ALS data acquired during the extensive NASA Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral & Thermal Imager (G-LiHT) campaigns, we developed the first release of FoScenes—a high-fidelity PAD product comprising 40 seamless scenes from 28 diverse forest sites, with individual area ranging from ∼50 to ∼11,000 ha. The leaf area estimates of LS-PVlad have been validated by two-year field-measured leaf area index (LAI) from litter collection (best RMSE = 0.35 m2/m2) and digital hemispherical photography (DHP) images (RMSE = 0.46 m2/m2) across multiple plots at a deciduous forest site. Additionally, a broad comparison between FoScenes and MODIS plant/leaf area index product demonstrates high consistency (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.86 m2/m2). By providing multi-dimensional forest characterizations, FoScenes enables temporal insights into structure dynamics. Its integration with the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model underscores the potential of FoScenes for extensive 3D RTM applications at various scales."

 To accurately invert the canopy parameters (Total photosynthetic area index, TPAI) of oilseed rape, a microwave characteristic layered measurement experiment was designed, and a multilayer microwave scattering semiempirical model (MLMSSM) was constructed based on the radar response changes induced by the differences in the vertical structure and canopy components at different phenological stages. This model was then applied to the main oilseed rape production areas to conduct regional TPAI inversion. Microwave characteristic layered measurement experiments were performed at six-leaf, flowering, beginning ripening and fully ripening stages of oilseed rape in the laboratory of target microwave properties (LAMP). The MLMSSM was constructed based on the LAMP-measured data, corresponding to different plant structures containing two- and three-layer submodels, and the TPAI inversion model was derived based on the correlation between the MLMSSM parameters and the crop biophysical variables. Finally, regional TPAI inversion and validation were carried out in the main oilseed rape production area (Hengyang), using Sentinel-1 SAR data. Visualization results, MLMSSM parameters and TPAI inversion results based on LAMP data all revealed the occurrence of multiple scattering interactions among distinct oilseed rape structural layers and verified the effectiveness of the measurement scheme and the model. The regional validation results showed high TPAI inversion accuracy throughout entire oilseed rape growth stages, with R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 1.03, and MAE = 0.74 under VV polarization, and R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.75, and MAE = 0.52 under VH polarization. The MLMSSM was found to significantly outperform the modified water cloud model (MWCM), increasing R2 by 0.05 and 0.18 under VV and VH polarization respectively, while reducing the RMSE and MAE by 0.49–0.72. These results prove the accuracy and applicability of the MLMSSM for regional TPAI inversion of oilseed rape."

 Soil spectroscopy is a powerful technique for soil monitoring. Hundreds of soil spectral datasets, both open-access and private, are used for various applications, despite potential errors. This study presents a filtering protocol to enhance the quality of soil spectral datasets from laboratory and satellite sources, here termed the Spectral Quality Protocol (SQuaP). At the beginning, we utilized a database of 9261 Brazilian soil samples, with paired laboratory hyperspectral (350–2500 nm), and Sentinel-2 multispectral data. Afterwards, we tested SQuaP on world-wide open datasets and on bare soil satellite observations identified by the Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3). A filtering approach is presented where we applied rule-based checks (crop residues, reflectance trend) flagged outliers via PCA-Mahalanobis, enforced contextual consistency with soil line regression, detecd cluster-aware anomalies using Isolation Forest within clusters, and validated property spectrum coherence via Random-Forest residuals. Results demonstrated at SQuaP enhances spectral data reliability, and consequently modeling performance of clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) using a Random Forest algorithm. For the hyperspectral data SQuaP increased R2 of 17.55 % for clay and 1.58 % for SOC, and reduced RMSE by 10.41 g kg−1 and 2.06 g kg−1, respectively. For satellite data, the improvements were even more pronounced, with an increase of 15.76 % for clay and 13.38 % for SOC on R2, and a reduction in RMSE. At the world scale, predictive performance improved after the implementation of SQuaP in nearly all continents, with gains in R2 ranging from −2.15 % to 13.40 % across evaluated scenarios. These findings highlight SQuAP's effectiveness in noise filtering and improving predictive accuracy, particularly for multispectral data. Furthermore, these improvements were achieved without compromising data variability, as confirmed by Kernel Desnsity Estimation (KDE) analysis, indicating that the protocol successfully removed outliers while preserving the statistical integrity of the dataset. SQuaP can be adapted to suit specific datasets and applications, facilitating more accurate soil property predictions and advancing in digital soil mapping and precision agriculture."

 Irrigation is the major consumer of freshwater resources on Earth and represents the largest human intervention in the water cycle. Most irrigation modeling frameworks rely on simplified assumptions regarding the timing of irrigation that result in significant error in the irrigation water use estimation. In this study, we developed a generalized data-driven approach for estimating these irrigation timing attributes using a change point detection algorithm applied to thermal remote sensing data. Land surface temperature at cropland pixels was compared with hydrologically similar natural land cover pixels nearby to extract irrigation attributes. The approach was evaluated over two areas: Nebraska (NEB) and Mahabad, Iran (MAH), for which we had the in situ irrigation data. The method detected the start and end of the irrigation season with reasonable accuracy, exhibiting errors of 18 % and 15 % in estimating the duration of season, in NEB and MAH respectively. The cloud cover either at the start or the end of season was the primary source of error in both cases. Irrigation event detection accuracy across 10 NEB sites yielded F1-scores (Precision & recall combined score) of 0.59–0.74, varying with change point detection algorithm parameters. To optimize these parameters, extensive hyperparameter tuning was performed, leading to specific suggestions tailored for different irrigation practices. The results presented here demonstrate that the LST-based approach can be effective in characterizing interannual variations in irrigation timing attributes."

 Soil moisture plays a crucial role in regulating land-atmosphere interactions, directly influencing hydrological and ecological processes. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has significant advantages in soil moisture retrieval; however, the accuracy of retrieval under different land cover conditions requires further investigation. This study systematically evaluates the performance of optical and radar-derived Vegetation Indices (VIs) in the WCM-Oh coupling model using Sentinel-1C-band dual-polarization SAR data, covering five land cover types (grassland, crops, shrubland, forest and desert). Additionally, a new radar-based vegetation index, SVIdp, is proposed and tested for the first time. This index is based on the interaction of dual-polarization scattering components. The results show: (1) The WCM-Oh model significantly improved retrieval accuracy in typical vegetation areas (grasslands and crops), with the correlation coefficient (R) increasing by 0.10 and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by 2 %–14 %, compared to the independent WCM model; (2) Under different land cover types, the WCM-Oh2004 coupling model based on GNDVI demonstrated high prediction accuracy (R = 0.66–0.85, ubRMSE = 0.0392–0.0698 m3/m3) in areas with moderate vegetation cover (e.g., grassland A, herbaceous vegetation A/B, wheat/corn rotation areas). However, areas such as alpine grasslands, artificial lawns, sparse vegetation, and tea plantations exhibited asymmetric errors, with underestimations in low-value regions and overestimations in high-value regions; (3) Performance of different vegetation indices: Biochemical optical indices (e.g., GNDVI, CVI) performed best in herbaceous vegetation areas, while structural radar indices (e.g., DpSVI, RVI) demonstrated superior stability in dense or structurally complex vegetation areas; (4) SVIdp outperformed DpRVI and NDVI in shrublands and grasslands.

 Plant traits serve as critical indicators of how plants adapt to environmental changes and influence ecosystem functions. While airborne hyperspectral remote sensing effectively maps plant traits through detailed reflectance properties, it is limited by cost and scale, making large-scale and temporal studies challenging. The recently launched spaceborne hyperspectral imager, PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), offers frequent, large scale and high-fidelity observations on a spatial resolution of 30 m and a revisit time of around 29 days, making it suitable for large-scale seasonal trait mapping. However, their potential remains largely unexplored. This study developed a multi-stage framework by leveraging the PRISMA spaceborne hyperspectral data and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) hyperspectral data to investigate the seasonal dynamics of four key plant traits — chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, equivalent water thickness, and nitrogen content — across eleven NEON sites representing diverse forest types and ecoregions in the contiguous U.S. Our results demonstrated that PRISMA hyperspectral data can reliably track seasonal variability in plant traits, achieving overall R2 values ranging from 0.78 to 0.88 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values ranging from 5.4 % to 8.4 % for the four traits. Seasonal patterns revealed bell-shaped trajectories for chlorophyll and carotenoids, while equivalent water thickness decreased steadily across most sites, driven by structural changes during leaf maturation and senescence. Nitrogen content exhibited less pronounced seasonal variation but followed expected nutrient resorption patterns. Analysis of environmental drivers showed that seasonal variability is primarily controlled by solar radiation and day length in northern sites, vapor pressure in semi-arid regions, and temperature in mid-southeastern sites. Spatial variability, meanwhile, was primarily driven by soil properties, particularly during the peak growing season. However, the influence of soil variables slightly declines toward the end of the season at several sites, as climatic factors become more prominent. This study highlights the capability of PRISMA, and potentially other similar spaceborne hyperspectral data for large-scale, time-series plant trait mapping and provides valuable insights into the interactions between plant traits and environmental factors. These findings contribute to advancing our understanding of plant functional ecology and improving predictions of ecosystem responses to environmental changes."

 Sun-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is the most promising remote-sensing proxy of Gross Primary Production (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the estimation of GPP using SIF is challenging when plants experience stress, particularly during extreme climatic events whose frequency is projected to increase in the future. Recently, the feasibility of canopy-level active chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (LED-induced chlorophyll fluorescence), which directly measure the apparent fluorescence yield (FyieldLIF), has provided new perspectives on detecting the responses of plants to stress. This study was conducted during the summer 2022 European heat waves in a mixed temperate deciduous broadleaf forest, located in the French Fontainebleau-Barbeau station. Continuous measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy exchanges, SIF, FyieldLIF, and ancillary environmental variables were acquired. We investigated how heat-wave induced high atmospheric dryness, measured as Vapor Pressure Deficit, affected canopy chlorophyll fluorescence (both SIF and FyieldLIF) and GPP, as well as their relationships. At the half-hourly scale, our results revealed a decrease of the correlation between SIF and GPP (R2 decreased from 0.49 to 0.17) at high atmospheric dryness. In contrast, the correlation between FyieldLIF and GPP increased significantly under high atmospheric dryness (R2 increased from 0.07 to 0.43). However, at the daily scale, the correlations between SIF and GPP and between FyieldLIF and GPP showed an overall increase compared to the half-hourly scale, suggesting a time-scale-dependent response of these relationships to atmospheric dryness. This study also highlighted FyieldLIF's advantage in detecting plant responses to high atmospheric dryness, and emphasized the potential of canopy-level active chlorophyll fluorescence for assessing the chlorophyll fluorescence-photosynthesis relationship under extreme climatic conditions."

 The rapid expansion of rice-crayfish farming in China has triggered significant land-use transformations, yet long-term mapping of these patterns remains challenging due to sample limitations and spectral complexities. This study developed a robust classification framework integrating synergistic sample generation and hierarchical classification to address this gap. We first proposed a sample generation method integrating temporal migration with feature-based enlargement strategy, then designed a two-layer stratified classification approach combining machine learning (Random Forest) with phenology-based techniques. Applied to the Jianghan Plain (2013−2022), our framework achieved high accuracy, with overall accuracy higher than 87 % annually and correlation around 0.90 with statistical data. Critical land use dynamics were noticed as follows: (1) Land-use transitions accelerated during 2016–2022, with rice-crayfish expanding predominantly at the expense of traditional rice cultivation (77 % ± 4.76 %) of rice-crayfish fields originated from rice-based cropping). (2) Single-rice areas declined by 24 % ± 3.02 %, while rapeseed-rice and wheat-rice systems decreased by 21 % ± 5.41 % and 26 % ± 5.32 %, respectively. (3) Conversions from dryland and water bodies to rice-crayfish emerged during 2019–2022, a later phase of expansion when the conversion to rice-crayfish became widespread. Overall, this study proposed a robust land use type classification framework for complex regions with limited samples in long-term, providing a transferable solution for monitoring land-system changes under rapid transitions. By revealing the transformative impact of rice-crayfish system expansion on traditional land use patterns, this study highlights its substantial effects on conventional rice cultivation and offers valuable insights for formulating adaptive land management strategies that support ecological sustainability and regional food security."

 The increasing frequency and severity of hydrological extremes demand the development of early warning systems and effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. Such systems and strategies require spatially detailed hydrological predictions, mostly provided by hydrological models. However, current state-of-the-art hydrological predictions remain limited in their spatial resolution. A proposed solution is the integration of high-resolution (<1 km) Earth observation (EO) products in hydrological modelling in order to reach hyper-resolution (approximately 1 km2). Nonetheless, proper use of these data in hydrological modelling requires a comprehensive characterization of their uncertainties. Here, we evaluate the performance of high-resolution EO products of four hydrological variables (7 precipitation products, 5 snow cover area products, 6 surface soil moisture products, and 6 actual evapotranspiration products) against observational references. Two merged EO precipitation products at 1 km resolution (merged IMERG-SM2A and merged ERA5-IMERG-SM2A) reached correlation coefficients >0.5 with the benchmark reference over most areas and are recommended for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling over Europe. The MODIS (resolution of 250 m) and Sentinel-2/Landsat-8 (resolution of 20/30 m) snow cover products showed the highest classification accuracy and were selected as the best choice for the use of snow cover area products in hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. For surface soil moisture, the NSIDC SMAP product at 1 km resolution yielded correlation coefficients >0.6 at most stations and is recommended for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. Finally, evapotranspiration products showed similar performances at the selected flux sites (correlations coefficients > 0.8). While the MODIS-Terra/Aqua evapotranspiration products (MOD16A2/MYD16A2) offer higher spatial resolution (500 m), making them potentially advantageous for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling, their temporal resolution is coarser (8-day intervals). In contrast, products like ETMonitor (1 km), ALEXI, and HOLAPS (5 km) provide daily estimates, albeit at lower spatial resolution. The assimilation of the proposed high-resolution products in models individually or in combination could lead us to hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. Still, developing integration workflows is required to overcome difficulties related to scale mismatches and data-gaps."

 Many commodity crops have growth stages during which they are particularly vulnerable to stress-induced yield loss. In-season crop progress information is useful for quantifying crop risk, and satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used to track progress at regional scales. At present, all existing RS-based crop progress estimation (CPE) methods which target crop-specific stages rely on ground truth data for training/calibration. Such data are collected via field trials or surveys. This reliance on ground survey data confines CPE methods to surveyed regions, limiting their utility. In this study, a new method is developed for conducting RS-based in-season CPE in unsurveyed regions by combining data from surveyed regions with synthetic crop progress data generated for an unsurveyed region of interest. Corn-growing zones in Argentina were used as surrogate ‘unsurveyed’ regions. These zones have climates and dual planting systems which differ from the single planting system in the US Midwest – the surveyed region in this study. Existing weather generation, crop growth, and optical radiative transfer models were linked to produce synthetic weather, crop progress, and canopy reflectance data. These data mimic weather, cultivars, and cropping practices in the unsurveyed region. A neural network (NN) method based upon bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory was trained separately on surveyed data, synthetic data, and two different combinations of surveyed and synthetic data. In the absence of real validation data in unsurveyed regions, a stopping criterion was developed which uses the weighted divergence of surveyed and synthetic data validation loss. F1 score was modified to measure CPE accuracy when the NN was trained on each data combination, with scores based on over- and under-estimates of crop progress throughout the season. Including synthetic data during training improved performance in 9 out of 11 corn-growing zones in Argentina. Net F1 scores across all crop progress stages increased by 8.7% when trained on a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data, and overall performance was only 21% lower than when the NN was trained on surveyed data and applied in the US Midwest. Performance gain from synthetic data was greatest in zones with dual planting windows, while the inclusion of surveyed region data from the US Midwest helped mitigate NN sensitivity to noise in NDVI data. Overall results suggest in-season CPE in other unsurveyed regions may be possible with increased quantity and variety of synthetic crop progress data."

 Operational national forest monitoring requires frequent, reliable observations for timely detection of deforestation and other forest changes. However, tropical forests, which encompass all current major deforestation fronts, are often hampered by persistent cloud cover. While radar remote sensing offers a compelling complement to optical data, a significant research gap remains in distinguishing the strengths and limitations of different radar sensors to the multiple stages of forest disturbance. Given the impending rapid expansion of available data outside the C band, it is imperative to assess the ability of these sensors to rapidly and accurately detect changes of high importance to the remote sensing community.To address this gap, we investigated the sensitivity of two freely available radar datasets — JAXA’s ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (L-band) and ESA’s Sentinel-1 (C-band) — to distinct stages of tropical forest loss. With a particular focus on detecting the earliest stage of deforestation, we compared backscatter values, SAR indices, and statistical metrics against time series data from 92 locations over three years in the Amazon. In these locations, early deforestation, biomass burning, and vegetation regrowth were occurring in different stages of the full conversion process. Our analysis revealed that the L-band-derived Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI) is highly sensitive to early deforestation, even when biomass remains on the ground soon after cutting. In contrast, C-band information showed limited ability to sense this critical initial stage of change, but was much stronger at detecting later deforestation stages. Our results point the way toward combining information from the upcoming L-Band NISAR mission with the existing C-band information to produce a multi-component system that can accurately detect deforestation in all its temporal stages."

 Land subsidence (LS) threatens public safety and sustainable socioeconomic development across the United States (US). Wide-area LS mapping plays a crucial role in improving the characterization of LS, thus contributing to a better understanding of its impacts beyond national borders. However, a nationwide LS map for the US is still lacking, and mapping LS at this scale faces challenges such as atmospheric artifacts, computational limitations, and data calibration issues. We develop a strategy for mapping and identifying LS on a nationwide scale. This strategy includes average deformation calculation, mosaicking of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) results, and LS areas extraction using deep learning. Using this strategy and extensive SAR data, we present the first high-resolution, nationwide LS map for the contiguous U. S. (CONUS), derived from 23,391 ascending Sentinel-1 images acquired between 2019 and 2021. Our analysis reveals that LS affects all 48 states and the District of Columbia, covering ∼45,666 km2. Approximately 73 % of LS occurs in cultivated lands, 10 % in wetlands, with groundwater overexploitation being the predominant driver of subsidence. These subsiding areas expose 6.26 million people, 160,071 buildings, and critical infrastructure, including thousands of kilometers of railways and roads. Although some measures have been implemented to mitigate LS, existing cases suggest that long-term groundwater management is essential, and significant challenges remain in addressing severe LS.

 Accurate characterization of the surface radiation budget (SRB) is essential for understanding the Earth's climate. Satellite-based SRB products are typically generated through estimating different components separately using various algorithms, thereby resulting in varying uncertainties and poor conservation. This study developed the SRB conservation constraint multi-task learning densely connected convolutional neural network models to jointly estimate global daily SRB at 1 km spatial resolution from MODIS observations spanning 2000–2023. These observations include reflectance from bands 1–5, 7, and 19; thermal radiance from bands 28–29 and 31–34; and ancillary information such as elevation, solar-viewing geometry, and GLASS-MODIS surface longwave radiation. Validation results against 224 sites over three years showed that the RMSEs of daily estimates for downward, upward, and net shortwave radiation were 29.38, 20.73, and 23.14 Wm−2, respectively; for downward, upward, and net longwave radiation, they were 19.98, 15.69, and 14.70 Wm−2; and for net radiation, it was 24.28 Wm−2. This method improves the underestimations of downward and net shortwave radiation in the MCD18A1, GLASS-MODIS, and BESS products; the accuracy of retrievals for downward and net longwave radiation is better than those from GLASS-MODIS and CERES-SYN. The estimates also reduce the non-conservation by 26.69 % compared to GLASS-MODIS. These improvements lie in the method's ability to enhance retrieval accuracy by utilizing cross-domain features from all components and to address non-conservation issues in SRB retrievals through the constraint of SRB conservation in the training. The SRB estimates exhibit great spatiotemporal consistency with other SRB products, except for regional reflected solar radiation and net radiation.

 The encroachment of human settlements into wildland areas has expanded the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), disrupting ecosystems and increasing wildfire risks. A systematic mapping of woody vegetation and building structures across the wildland-urban continuum is critical for fire risk and ecosystem service assessment, fuel management, conservation, and land use planning. The highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of this landscape requires a fine-scale monitoring approach. Although machine learning and computer vision have advanced land cover classification using very high resolution imagery (VHR), most studies either focus on identifying only a particular object or a limited study area. We here developed a unified semantic segmentation deep learning model (U-Net) to map trees, shrubs, and building footprints at 0.6 m resolution using the open-source VHR multispectral imagery from the National Aerial Imaging Program (NAIP) for the state of California. A semi-automatic labeling process was adapted to generate a large set of labels for model training and testing with available aerial LiDAR surveys. The validation showed robust performance of the trained U-Net model in predicting canopy-scale trees and shrubs as well as buildings, achieving an overall accuracy of 87.1% and F1 scores of 83.1% for trees and 78.9% for shrubs across different years. Further evaluation demonstrated that this approach captured the fine-scale spatial arrangement of woody vegetation and buildings, and the temporal vegetation dynamics from selective logging, regrowth, and tree mortality following wildfire. The model’s scalability was also shown for county and statewide mapping. Given the availability of open-access NAIP imagery every 2–3 years over the continental US, our scalable approach provides a sub-meter monitoring tool and data to improve ecological and building assessment and fire simulation. These capabilities support adaptive land management to mitigate WUI fire risk and ultimately promote fire-safe communities and resilient ecosystems along the WUI-wildland gradient."

 Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) density mapping initiatives generally use one of three remote sensing approaches: lidar, radar, or near-nadir multispectral imaging leveraging machine learning methods, or a combination thereof. However, the active instrument record is limited and near-nadir multispectral imaging data are relatively insensitive to canopy physical structure. Multiangle imaging enables annual wall-to-wall mapping with a global record that extends back to 2000 as these data are highly sensitive to forest AGB. This paper describes work to validate estimates in a published annual, wall-to-wall record of forest AGB on a 250 m grid, derived using 672 nm imagery from the NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) for 2000–2021, covering the southwestern United States. Estimates in the published MISR-derived annual forest AGB map series for the southwestern United States and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L4B Gridded 1 km AGB product were both found to be highly consistent with NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) airborne lidar survey (ALS) AGB data. MISR and GEDI v.2 (v.2.1) estimates yielded similar coefficients of determination (∼0.7) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (∼60 Mg ha−1) for all ALS data used. For the large CMS Sonoma County Improved AGB dataset, MISR and GEDI v.2 (v.2.1) estimates yielded R2 = 0.88, 0.88 (0.91); RMSE = 58, 40 (37) Mg ha−1. Estimates from MISR thus have an accuracy similar to that of the GEDI L4B gridded AGB product, with some limitations (e.g., topographic shading, tall, dense canopies). However the published MISR maps are on a 250 m grid, wall-to-wall, and cover the period 2000–2021. These results suggest MISR is able to provide a means to investigate trajectories of forest AGB change in the southwestern U.S. from 2000 onwards—over a substantial period of accelerating environmental and human- and climate-driven change– with reasonable precision."

 Faster, better, and more accurate burned area (BA) mapping is crucial for assessing the environmental and socio-economic impacts of wildfires. However, the diverse background disturbance, spectral variability, and extensive distribution of BAs pose significant challenges to their detection using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery over large areas. Here, we developed a novel Moderate Spatial Resolution Burned Area Change Detection (MSR-BACD) framework, addressing these challenges through dataset development, model innovation, and inference optimization. Specifically: (1) we constructed a globally comprehensive MSR-BACD dataset, incorporating more than one million positive and negative samples (256 × 256 pixels) across diverse land cover backgrounds and cloud conditions to enhance model generalization; (2) we developed a specialized deep learning (DL) foundation model (custom Swin Transformer) leveraging dual-temporal (pre-and-post-fire) imagery to achieve precise BA delineation; and (3) we designed a candidate-based inference mode, collectively using the computational power and petabyte-scale RS data of the Google Earth Engine to generate BA candidates and the DL foundation model deployed on local GPU servers to filter out erroneous detections and delineate the BA extent, to improve detection efficiency significantly. Experimental results demonstrate that the MSR-BACD framework achieved a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.50 % in closed-set scenarios and outperformed existing moderate-resolution BA products in open-set evaluations in Portugal, increasing the Dice coefficient by 19.90 % while reducing computational costs by 95.62 % compared to traditional scene-by-scene exhaustive inference. These advancements highlight the MSR-BACD framework as a robust and efficient tool for regional-scale BA detection, contributing to wildfire science and application progress."

 Snow on sea ice strongly modulates growth, albedo, and air–sea exchange, but it also drives major uncertainties in altimeter-based thickness retrievals. This is critical for Ku-band radar altimeters (e.g., CryoSat-2, CS-2), whose waveforms integrate backscatter from snow-covered sea ice. Contrary to the common assumption that returns originate near the snow–ice interface, complex snow properties (roughness, layering, wetness, ice lenses) can shift effective scattering upward into the snowpack. We analyze Ku-band CS-2 satellite and Ka-band KAREN airborne waveforms over the Weddell Sea to partition contributions from the snow surface, snow volume, and ice surface. Using a physics-based Forward Backscatter Emulation Model (FBEM) and a CNN trained on simulated waveforms, we retrieve geophysical parameters and assess sensitivity to snow conditions. Under typical Antarctic conditions, snow-volume scattering contributes as much as, or more than, the snow–ice interface to CS-2 returns, while Ka-band is dominated by surface/near-surface snow scattering with minimal penetration to the ice surface. Wet snow further amplifies upper-layer backscatter. Sensitivity tests identify volume scattering and ice-surface roughness as primary controls on waveform shape. These results argue for explicit snow-volume terms in waveform models and support dual-frequency strategies relevant to ESA’s upcoming CRISTAL mission.

 The surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect, assessed through remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), remains a focal point in urban climate research. Conventional indicators like SUHI intensity (SUHII) and footprint (SUHIF) capture peak values and spatial extent but fail to account for the cumulative thermal load—a critical dimension reflecting the total heat exposure imposed by spatially continuous warming, which directly limits a holistic assessment of ecological and societal impacts of the SUHI effect. Therefore, this study introduces an indicator termed SUHI capacity (SUHIC), designed to quantify the aggregated SUHI effect by integrating the magnitude of the warming signal across all affected areas, thereby enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of urban thermal environments. Furthermore, a direction-enhanced adaptive synchronous extraction (DEASE) method is proposed for the quantification of SUHIC. This method can dynamically identify the optimal background reference area based on the urban-rural LST gradients in various directions within the city, without relying on predefined mathematical models as previously. The results from 102 European cities first confirm that the directional variations in urban-rural LST gradients, and the DEASE method can effectively capture these distinctions for the simultaneous estimation of SUHII, SUHIF, and SUHIC. Secondly, the spatial patterns of absolute SUHIC values show strong associations with those of SUHIF (R2 > 0.86), while its relative values (normalized by the area of urban) align more closely with SUHII (R2 > 0.64). More importantly, SUHIC can serve as a crucial reference for assessing the urban thermal signal when SUHII and SUHIF diverge. The proposed method and framework contribute to standardizing the quantification of the SUHI effect."

Multi-metric remote sensing is key to assessing ecosystem resilience. 
 Climate-driven increases in wildfire frequency threaten forest resilience in fire-prone ecosystems. Although short-term studies indicate rapid recovery of eucalypt forests, such assessments may be overly optimistic, given the uncertain long-term alignment of structural and functional trajectories. This study integrated multi-source remote sensing data (2000−2020) with eddy covariance flux measurements to quantify post-fire recovery dynamics of eucalypt forests in southeastern Australia. We analyzed key structural metrics, including fraction of tree cover (FTC), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and leaf area index (LAI), as well as functional traits, including gross primary productivity (GPP), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), evapotranspiration (ET), fuel moisture content (FMC), and vegetation optical depth (VOD). On average, all these traits recovered to pre-fire levels within 5.5 to 7.5 years, though some areas required over a decade or more. Recovery trajectories diverged notably both between the structural and functional categories and among individual traits within each category. These recovery rates varied across forest groups, modulated by disturbance severity, understory compositions, and fire frequency. Notably, functional traits such as GPP and SIF recovered rapidly, surpassing even the fastest structural metrics. At the Wallaby Creek flux site (burned in 2009 and rebuilt), GPP and SIF exhibited a distinct “peak-decline-stabilize” pattern, surpassing pre-fire levels within three years before declining as LAI recovered. In contrast, structural metrics recovered gradually, with LAI lagging behind FTC and NDVI. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating multi-dimensional data to comprehensively assess forest recovery, offering critical insights for ecosystem management and carbon cycle modeling in fire-prone regions."

 High-quality and temporally continuous surface reflectance data are essential for remote sensing applications, but cloud contamination introduces severe spatiotemporal gaps in optical satellite image time series (SITS). Recent multi-modal approaches, integrating optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with deep learning models, have advanced gap-free SITS reconstruction. However, several challenges remain. These include the reliance on external preprocessing to generate regular optical composite time series (e.g., 8-day intervals) and to temporally align SAR with optical data; insufficient modeling of the relationship between observation time series and their corresponding timestamps limits output flexibility, especially when generating predictions at any or user-specified time points; and reduced training and inference efficiency due to the incorporation of an additional modality (SAR). Collectively, these limitations hinder the practical applicability of current methods. To address the above challenges, this study proposes AnytimeFormer, a Transformer-based model for optical SITS reconstruction. First, AnytimeFormer accepts Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 observations along with their corresponding timestamps as input, and adaptively aligns temporally asynchronous multi-modal time series through a time-align attention module. Second, a low-rank fusion module is introduced to capture multi-modal information while preserving a lightweight architecture. Finally, a time-aware decoder enables the reconstruction of reflectance data at any user-specific time point. Extensive experiments conducted across eight globally distributed study sites, encompassing diverse land cover types and a range of cloud conditions, demonstrate the superior performance of AnytimeFormer (e.g., average RMSE: 0.03, R2: 0.95 at 80 % missing ratio) over benchmarks (HANTS, U-TILISE, STORI, RESTORE-DiT, et al.) under scenarios with different missing ratios and temporal pattern complexity. In terms of efficiency, compared to the suboptimal STORI, it reduces training time tenfold. Furthermore, the comparison with the Planet Fusion product shows a high consistency in temporal trends between the two and demonstrates AnytimeFormer's flexibility in reconstructing user-specified intervals. All the experiment results demonstrate that AnytimeFormer is a promising and practical solution for gap-free optical SITS reconstruction.

 Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) is tightly linked to photosynthetic electron transport and informs gross primary productivity (GPP) across scales. Sun-induced ChlF (SIF) is typically retrieved at specific wavelengths (e.g., Fraunhofer lines, oxygen absorption bands) within a narrow field of view (solid angle), and given in power units. This spectral SIF radiance, denoted SIFλ, is not directly photosynthetically relevant, rather, it is the integrated radiant exitance, SIFint, expressed in molar units and integrated over 660–800 nm and the full angular domain, that corresponds mechanistically to photosynthesis. It is generally assumed that the SIFλ is proportional to SIFint and that this proportionality is spatially and temporally invariant. Here we tested this assumption with spectrally resolved SIF measured in three crop and six tree species at the leaf level. We found that while SIFλ is significantly related to SIFint at individual Fraunhofer lines, this relationship varies with wavelength and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). We therefore developed a model to predict SIFint from SIFλ using wavelength and LCC as inputs. The model performed well across the ChlF emission band, particularly in the far-red region, enabling accurate conversion from observed SIFλ to mechanistically relevant SIFint. As an exploratory extension, the model was applied at the canopy scale for C3 and C4 crops with the Mechanistic Light Response model, yielding encouraging agreement between modeled and observed GPP. The core contribution of this work is establishing the SIFλ–SIFint relationship and a transfer model at the leaf scale, while the canopy application serves as an exploratory extension illustrating its scaling potential. Together, these findings provide a more mechanistically consistent basis for SIF-based GPP estimation and strengthen the application of fluorescence observations in carbon cycle research."

 Accurate maps of cropland soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and clay content are essential for climate-smart agriculture. Soil reflectance composites (SRC), derived from multispectral bare soil observations, offer a scalable approach to high-resolution soil mapping. While studies often focus on maximizing model performance, challenges remain regarding (1) the bias introduced by masking and excluding soil samples during SRC generation and (2) the accurate representation of the full range and distribution of soil properties in the resulting maps. Evaluating different SRC parameters, we found that commonly used indices such as the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were significantly correlated with clay content and SOCS, respectively. These dependencies can lead to the systematic exclusion of high SOCS (>80 Mg ha−1) and clay (>30 mass%) samples during SRC generation, introducing bias in the resulting maps. Models trained solely on SRC bands failed to capture the full range of the training data, limiting the applicability of the soil property maps. While the inclusion of additional remote sensing features, such as spectral-temporal metrics and indices, significantly improved the prediction accuracy, the representation of the imbalanced samples remained challenging. We demonstrated that a combined framework of spatial data augmentation and majority undersampling was effective in improving the range and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of the predictions (SOCS = 0.82; Clay = 0.9). Our findings emphasize the importance of (1) evaluating excluded samples to identify potential SRC-induced bias, and (2) optimizing model predictions reflecting the observed data range to improve the reliability and usability of the resulting soil maps."

 High-resolution monitoring of root-zone soil moisture is essential for optimizing irrigation in precision agriculture. This study demonstrates the potential of drone-borne Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) to map spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics across an agricultural field over an entire growing season. Using the innovative gprSense® system, which combines a frequency-domain radar with full-wave inversion, we achieved precise and automated data acquisition and processing. To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement time-lapse, root-zone soil moisture mapping using drone-borne GPR combined with real-time full-wave inversion. Time-lapse mapping was conducted in a spinach field, yielding eight high-resolution soil moisture maps that captured dynamic variations driven by precipitation and irrigation. Operating in the frequency range 110–120 MHz, the system measured soil moisture down to a depth of approximately 35–40 cm, with comparisons performed using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and mass balance analyses. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) provided complementary data into soil electrical conductivity patterns. Results revealed strong agreement between GPR-derived soil moisture estimates and conventional methods, with spatial patterns aligning closely with predictions from Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models.

 Current disaster and emergency management services produce flood maps within hours using satellite data. To handle large-scale events efficiently, a reliable automated method is needed to generate an initial flood extent map, which can then be refined manually.Launched in December 2022, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, equipped with the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn), provides high-resolution radar observations used here for flood detection. While not initially designed for detailed flood mapping in vegetated or urban regions, the performance of SWOT’s Pixel Cloud products was assessed during four major flood events in Greece, France, Brazil, and the USA. Each event is paired with Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 imagery within a 3-hour time frame, providing a valuable opportunity to compare and evaluate SWOT’s flood detection capabilities.Three radar variables of the Pixel Cloud products are studied for extracting flood extents: σ0, coherent power, and interferometric coherence — which is computed from the two complex interferograms. They are compared to the built-in classification and flood masks computed from Sentinel-1/2. The study demonstrates the capabilities of the SWOT satellite in detecting flooded vegetation, flooded urban areas, and even regions with high snow cover. However, limitations are observed: (1) when high soil moisture is observed, causing signal saturation, (2) SWOT can be sensitive to the incidence angle, both of which lead to less reliable flood extent estimation. These findings highlight the potential of SWOT satellite for improving global flood mapping, as well as the need for further exploration to address current limitations and enhance flood monitoring capabilities in the near future."

 With the continuous advancement of global urbanization and industrialization, the pollution issue (e.g., light pollution) has become increasingly severe, posing a serious threat to the global dark sky quality. Evaluating the global dark sky quality and conducting site selection for potential dark sky parks not only contribute to the protection of natural ecosystems and the safeguarding of ecological security, but also provide scientific reference for sustainable ecotourism. Thus, our study integrated remote sensing nighttime light, cloud cover, and other data to develop a global dark sky quality identification based on the random forest model, effectively achieving interannual and seasonal dynamic identification of global dark sky quality. Then, the study defined global construction potential constraints and conducted site selection research for potential conventional dark sky parks and potential seasonal dark sky parks. The results show that in 2023, areas with high dark sky quality accounted for only 20.6 % globally, mainly distributed in high-altitude or arid regions worldwide, including the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, inland Australia, and other areas. From 2012 to 2023, global dark sky quality exhibited an interannual fluctuation pattern of “decline–rise–decline” and further showed significant seasonal differences. In addition, the identified potential conventional dark sky parks are mainly distributed in southern Africa, the southwestern United States, and other regions, while potential seasonal dark sky parks are mainly located in the Korean Peninsula, southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and other areas.

 Accurate estimation of leaf spectral properties or biochemical parameters from canopy-level reflectance has long posed a significant challenge in quantitative remote sensing due to the inherent variability and complexity of canopy structures. This study presents 3D-Diff, an innovative differentiable three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer approach for retrieving leaf and soil spectral properties using remote sensing imagery with known 3D canopy structures. Implemented within the LESS (LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation) model, 3D-Diff employs computer graphics-derived differentiable modeling to compute reflectance derivatives relative to scene parameters during forward simulation. A gradient-based optimization algorithm then minimizes discrepancies between simulated and observed images to estimate scene parameters. Validations using both virtual experiments and real measurements demonstrated robust performance across varying parameter quantities. Notably, the results show that the reflectance/transmittance of all scene parameters were accurately estimated with maximum RMSE of 0.015 for virtual experiments, including non-directly-observed elements, and maximum RMSE of 0.096 for real measurements. Spatial resolution significantly affected accuracy, with relative RMSE values of 0.07 % (0.05 m) and 1.4 % (2.5 m) for a dense virtual forest scene. Although computationally slower than analytic models, this work establishes differentiable radiative transfer as a promising framework for fine-scale vegetation mapping, enabling simultaneous multi-parameter retrieval while maintaining physical interpretability."

 Seagrass meadows directly and indirectly provide a wide range of ecosystem services, but their close proximity to anthropogenic activities renders them highly vulnerable. Regardless of their vulnerability and importance as ecosystem health indicators, intertidal seagrasses, unlike their subtidal relatives, have yet to be assessed at continental scales, and current global estimates of seagrass extent either do not mention intertidal seagrasses or combine them with subtidal seagrasses. Here, we present a first of its kind map of intertidal seagrasses in Europe using a harmonised methodology. Over a total intertidal area of 15,100 km2, we found that seagrasses cover an area comparable to the combined areas of Paris and Lisbon: 212 ± 18.8 km2. The proportion of available intertidal area covered by seagrass decreased towards higher latitudes (from ∼5.4 % at 35°N to ∼0 % at 58°N). Regardless of this pattern, the top three hotspots of seagrass covered the full latitudinal range of Europe, notably in the North Frisian Wadden Sea (Germany), Arcachon Bay (France) and Ria Formosa (Portugal). Furthermore, we showed latitudinal gradients in seagrass cover, with higher cover in low latitudes and lower cover in high latitudes. Finally, an almost linear change in intertidal seagrass peak timing (day of the year of maximum seagrass cover) with latitude was found, with peak timing later the further south. This is a ‘Call-to-Action’ for data that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). We present critical data for prioritising and developing policies, management and protection mechanisms across local, regional or international scales to safeguard these important ecosystems and the societies that depend upon them."

 Mapping forest landscape fragmentation (FLF) after fires is essential for maintaining ecosystem balance, reducing fire-related losses, and minimizing environmental damage. However, the “salt-and-pepper” phenomenon complicates accurate FLF mapping at fine resolutions (≤ 10 m) in mountainous regions. To relieve the phenomenon, this study used the multi-vegetation index (MVI) to represent FLF and applied the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm to convert pixels into objects before classification, and then SNIC-MVI RF was introduced to map FLF using Sentinel-2 imagery and land use data. In combination with topographical and meteorological data, the Geodetector was employed to analyze the influencing factors on FLF patterns across different fire severity ranges. The results indicate that: (1) The proposed SNIC-MVI RF can accurately retrieve FLF across a range of fire severity using 10-m Sentinel-2 imagery while mitigating the “salt-and-pepper” phenomenon, with an average precision of 96.2 % and an average F1-score of 97.4 %. (2) The FLF spatial patterns exhibit significant differences across fire severity. Low fire severity (LFS) leads to an increase in the number of small patches, moderate fire severity (MFS) results in more complex patch edges, and high fire severity (HFS) promotes greater patch aggregation. (3) Pre-fire meteorological conditions and vegetation cover are major influences on the spatial patterns of FLF under different fire severities. This study will provide a new method for exploring the impact of different fire severities on FLF in central Yunnan. As an important indicator for assessing ecological disturbance and habitat degradation, analyzing the response of fragmentation to different fire severities can help administrators evaluate the impacts of fire on FLF more scientifically and develop more targeted and sustainable forest management and ecological restoration strategies."

 The development of digital twins for urban road intersections has attracted significant attention in recent research, driven by their potential to enable intelligent intersections that require accurate and real-time monitoring of dynamic environments. Lidar sensors, with their precise 3D perception capabilities, are particularly well-suited for enhancing intersection perception, offering accurate detection and tracking of road objects, as well as precise velocity estimation. However, existing roadside lidar datasets are deficient in terms of scene diversity and annotation information specifically tailored for intersection monitoring applications.

Benchmark evaluations are performed for 3D object detection and tracking tasks to facilitate standardized comparative analysis.

 Flowers provide significant ecological and economic benefits. Despite rapid technological progress and broad availability of remote sensing data, flower detection and monitoring are still challenging because many phenological studies rely on vegetation indices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) which are not well-suited for flowers. Although some studies have focused on detection of flowering, the development and application of a comprehensive and robust remote sensing method for flowering remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce the flower color index (FCI) for detecting four major warm flower colors—red, pink, purple, and yellow—by leveraging remote sensing bands including blue (B), green (G), red (R) and near-infrared (NIR); these bands are widely available across a variety of remote sensing platforms. Here, we demonstrate the application of FCI across species representing a range of vegetation forms (herbaceous, shrubs, and trees) and study locations, corresponding to global biodiversity hotspots. We also tested FCI performance utilizing imagery with different spatial resolution—SkySat (0.5 m), PlanetScope (3 m), and Landsat (30 m). We show that FCI effectively detects and quantifies flowering events, which can be widely applied in ecology (e.g., flowering phenology, species identification, biodiversity conservation), agriculture (e.g., pollination management, yield estimation), and ecotourism (e.g., cherry blossom festival). Our proposed FCI has a simple formulation, is fast to calculate, and robust to different environments (urban or natural), spatial scales (spatial resolution and spatial extent), and background effects. Optimal FCI threshold—though variable across environments and settings—consistently lies on the right side of the distribution, facilitating automatic flower detection."

 Compound Hot and Dry Events (CHDEs), the co-occurrence of heatwaves (HWs) and dry events (DEs), are intensifying across Europe, heightening risks to human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. This study quantifies the spatiotemporal evolution, frequency, duration, and severity of CHDEs from 1980 to 2023 and identifies both persistent hotspots and emerging risk regions. A compound-event detection framework combining percentile-based HW thresholds (85th, 90th, 95th) with Effective Drought Index (EDI) metrics was applied to E-OBS daily data at 0.1° resolution for the warm season (May–September). Three indicators, frequency, total occurrence, and severity, were used to assess long-term trends and spatial variability. Vector analysis decomposed CHDE drivers, estimating the relative contributions of HWs and DEs. Results show a 35–45% increase in annual CHDEs after 2000, with severe 7-day events (95th percentile) rising by 2.7% per year. The Mediterranean basin (Iberia, southern France, Italy, Greece, western Turkey) remains the principal hotspot, while central and northern Europe (Germany, Poland, the Baltic region, southern Scandinavia) have experienced a three- to five-fold rise in frequency. Vector angles (mean ≈12°) and magnitudes indicate HWs as the dominant driver, with DEs amplifying risks regionally. Urban areas exhibit 60–70% higher growth rates than rural zones, reflecting strong Urban Heat Island effects. These findings highlight two adaptation priorities: (1) enhancing drought–heat resilience in the Mediterranean (MED)through water-efficient agriculture and heat-health preparedness, and (2) strengthening monitoring and early-warning systems in emerging northern hotspots.

 Ocean remote sensing is essential for a wide range of marine applications, yet persistent cloud cover often introduces large spatiotemporal gaps that undermine data continuity and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose the Bayesian Field Convolutional Neural Network (BF-CNet), a probabilistic fusion network designed for cloud-affected reconstruction and forecasting. BF-CNet consists of two cooperating modules: the Uncertainty Feature Extraction Module (UFEM), built upon Bayesian Neural Fields, which performs pixel-wise posterior inference from cloud-free observations to reconstruct missing regions with quantified uncertainty; and the Spatiotemporal Inference Module (SIM), a ConvLSTM-based network that propagates these probabilistic representations through time for short-term forecasting. The two modules are trained sequentially within a cascaded framework. A hybrid loss function that combines per-quantile mean absolute error (MAE) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is adopted to balance deterministic accuracy and probabilistic calibration. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation framework integrating deterministic (MAE, RMSE, PSNR, SSIM) and probabilistic (PICP, ECE) metrics is employed to jointly assess reconstruction fidelity and uncertainty reliability. Trained on datasets with physically realistic cloud masks, BF-CNet achieves substantial improvements over advanced baselines (e.g., cloud-region reconstruction MAE = 0.367, RMSE = 0.643, SSIM = 0.943, PSNR = 34.32 dB; ECE = 0.011), while maintaining computational efficiency and robust generalization across different oceanic variables. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of probabilistic deep learning models in addressing missing-data challenges in ocean remote sensing, providing a reliable tool for spatiotemporal ocean monitoring and operational decision-making under cloudy conditions."

 Flood victims are often trapped inside buildings or stranded on rooftops, making their detection a critical aspect of effective rescue operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as an essential tool for disaster response, particularly in locating stranded individuals during flooding events. However, existing datasets do not specifically cater to this application, limiting the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, a novel public dataset called the NITC person rescue dataset is introduced. It consists of UAV-captured images of individuals stranded within buildings and on rooftops with two types of labels: bounding boxes and image captions. This dataset presents challenging environmental conditions that significantly impact the performance of pre-trained models. In particular, these models struggle with detecting individuals behind windows, highlighting the limitations of applying general-purpose object detection models to domain-specific tasks. This performance deterioration emphasizes the need for fine-tuning to adapt these models to specialized rescue scenarios. This work systematically evaluates various fine-tuning strategies and their effectiveness in improving model performance. The advantages of model-structure-based fine-tuning are illustrated using YOLOv9 and YOLOv11 as case studies. The best-performing model achieves an AP@50 of 87% for detecting person instances on unseen data.

 The vegetation greening trend resulting from afforestation in the Southwest China’s karst (SCK) area has attracted significant research attention. Identifying the interannual variation in net primary productivity (NPP), its sustained reaction to climate change, and differences between new and old forests before and after afforestation is vital in assessing the effect of the climate on the carbon sink potential of ecosystems. Using monthly NPP and climate data for 1981–2019, ensemble empirical mode decomposition was employed for the extraction of the interannual signal, and new and old forests were compared based on changepoint detection and forest-age data. According to the results, (1) NPP change significantly increased in 1981–2019; after 2001, the NPP growth rate in new forests was 1.47 times that in the old forests, indicating greater carbon sink potential. (2) NPP was sensitive to climate change on an interannual scale, and the sensitivity increased further after 2001. (3) Additionally, the main determinant of NPP in old and new forests shifted from precipitation to soil surface water content after 2001,which closely aligns with the implementation of large-scale ecological restoration projects. The findings reveal that afforestation reinforces water constraints and shifts the dominant climatic control, providing a basis for evaluation of ecological restoration effectiveness in the SCK area and supporting incorporation of water and carbon trade-offs into afforestation planning and routine forest management.

 Crop yield prediction at a fine spatial scale is crucial for improving agricultural management and resource allocations. Many countries and regions lack fine-scale yield data for fine-scale modeling and thus have to use a “cross-scale pathway”, where coarse-scale (e.g., state-level) data are used to train a model for fine-scale (e.g., county-level or field-level) yield predictions. However, the cross-scale pathway has limited effectiveness in predicting yield due to issues with data availability and model scalability. In this study, we quantify the benefits of transfer learning in the cross-scale pathway. We applied transfer learning by fine-tuning a previously trained and validated AI-based machine learning model, originally developed for field-level soybean yield predictions in the United States, using Brazilian state-level data to predict Brazilian municipal-level soybean yield. Despite differences in environmental conditions, crop phenology, and yield responses between the U.S. and Brazil, we show that transfer learning improves the municipal-level predictions from the cross-scale pathway by increasing the R2 from 0.29 (without transfer learning) to 0.44. Notably, this is achieved without using any municipal-level data and relying only on scarce state-level observations. When the municipal-level data were used, the transfer learning achieved an R2 of 0.57, the most stable high performance compared with previous studies. The effectiveness of the cross-scale pathway, thus, increases from 50% to 78% with transfer learning. These findings demonstrate the benefits of transfer learning in the cross-scale pathway under data-limited conditions, and underscore the potential for global crop yield predictions across scales."

 Slums are densely populated urban areas characterized by substandard housing and squalor. These areas often lack basic infrastructure and services, making them challenging to manage and improve. Mapping slums on a large scale is particularly difficult due to their complex, dynamic, and non-uniform nature and the scarcity of available data. This study employs deep learning and uncertainty estimation to map slum areas in 55 diverse cities. We tackle the issues of scarce labels, noisy labels, and class imbalance to produce reliable slum probability maps. Applied to a large dataset from the Global South, our method approximates probability values to each image, yielding a more granular view of slum morphology within each city. We achieve this by combining Monte Carlo sampling through test-time augmentation, test-time dropout on overlapping image tiles, and an ensemble of four CNNs. The resulting probability maps not only quantify prediction uncertainty but also reveal morphological patterns of slum settlements. Our findings underscore the diversity and complexity of slums, contributing to a more complete understanding of these environments. A key result is our large-scale workflow, which, despite limited data, groups predictions by probability into multiple slum categories defined by their morphological traits. This approach offers a substantial improvement over traditional binary slum classification methods that focus solely on typical slum morphologies."

 Traditional optical satellite geometric positioning methods have certain limitations, including the high costs of calibration field construction, the time required, and significant susceptibility to weather conditions at calibration sites. In the present era of ever-increasing satellite constellation deployments, such conventional methods struggle to meet operational demands. Consequently, self-geolocation technologies are receiving more attention. This paper presents a self-geolocation method that completely eliminates the dependency on ground control points. The method uses images acquired during different orbits as inputs and leverages the geographic positioning consistency of corresponding points to calculate a sensor installation matrix without any need for control points. Initial experiments using simulated data revealed the method to be feasible. Subsequent validation using real data from the Luojia 3–02 satellite showed that the positioning accuracy was comparable to traditional method, but the calculation cost was significantly lower.

 Deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as potential tools for automated landform mapping. However, current approaches frequently overlook critical topographic features and prior topographic knowledge, which are essential for accurate landform differentiation. Consequently, these approaches struggle to resolve indistinct class boundaries and misclassification in transitional landform zones. The application of transformer-based approaches to landform mapping remains rare, although these methods are well-suited for capturing global geomorphic patterns. In this study, we develop TKGFormer, a topographic knowledge-guided and transformer-based DL model specifically designed for landform classification. This model explicitly integrates terrain residuals and multi-scale terrain feature-guided attention mechanisms to emphasise key topographic features and improve classification accuracy. We introduce a topographic feature prior loss function, which constrains the learning process by enforcing consistency between predicted landform classes and fundamental terrain characteristics. Moreover, we design an efficient decoder to enhance multiscale feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that TKGFormer outperforms five CNN-based models and two transformer-based model in landform mapping by using bare Earth 30 m resolution Copernicus digital elevation data. In terms of mIoU, TKGFormer exhibits an improvement that ranges from 4.4 % to 20.7 % over the other models.

 Existing police resource allocation relies on the prediction of historical crime hotspots, which is difficult to balance the overall effectiveness and regional fairness, resulting in an imbalance in the allocation of resources and difficulty in adapting to dynamic security needs. Taking Los Angeles as the study area, this study first constructs an XGBoost regression prediction model to quantify the future crime risk of each area based on the crime location and time information in the historical crime data, and then introduces the minimum regional disparity (MRD) constraint on the basis of which the fairness indicator is integrated into the optimization framework of patrol region allocation. Meanwhile, this study innovatively introduces a deep reinforcement learning method to improve the model’s solution efficiency and adaptability under complex constraints by interacting with the environment through a policy network. The experimental results show that the MRD fairness model significantly improves resource allocation fairness. Compared with the maximum coverage model, the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation decrease by 42.56 % and 57.59 %, respectively, and the Jain’s fairness index simultaneously increases by 94.33 %.

Additionally, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy substantially reduces computational time compared to the classical mixed-integer programming solver, efficiently meeting dual constraints of fairness and coverage effectiveness. In summary, this study integrates MRD constraints and DRL to achieve equitable, efficient policing resource allocation, providing a practical and effective technical pathway for addressing fairness and efficiency demands."

 Recently developed documentation technologies in the science of aquatic ecosystems can provide a large volume of new data. Some sets of documentary data, although developed for a different purpose, can be used to increase the effectiveness of water management and possibly help to better protect riverscapes. Such a source of data is riverscape photos can be used to assess the state of the river environment. In our article, we attempted to assess the hydromorphological condition of rivers based on available riverscape photos in Google Street View (GSV). In accordance with the River Habitat Survey protocol, one of the classic methods of assessing the hydromorphological condition implemented worldwide, we assessed the parameters of the hydromorphological condition of 60 stretches of selected Polish rivers located in different regions of the country, having specific and different physiographic features (slope, flow velocity, discharge, degree of modification). Then, based on available multimedia materials (GSV photos), we independently assessed the same parameters affecting the class of the hydromorphological condition of rivers and performed a comparative statistical analysis. No statistically significant difference between the assessment of the hydromorphological river status using the standard RHS field protocol and the assessment using GSV (p values of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test 0.19 – 0.98). Although the results require further verification on larger data sets, we see significant potential for using GSV in supplementing field methods of river hydromorphology assessment with this data. We postulate that in the absence of field analyses and with the availability of GSV materials or other photographic materials from rivers (e.g., citizen science), a reliable assessment of the hydromorphological state of rivers can still be made."

 Mitigating volcanic eruption disasters is a key priority in Indonesia’s national development agenda. Due to the high density of active volcanoes near populated areas, even eruptions with a relatively low Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) can result in significant fatalities and losses. Therefore, rapid mapping of eruption impacts is essential both during and following an eruption. Machine learning with Earth Observation (EO) data enhances the speed and accuracy of volcanic impact mapping, critical for timely disaster response. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three machine learning classifiers − Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost – for mapping land surface changes resulting from volcanic deposits (e.g. lahars, pyroclastic density currents and lava) across three different data availability scenarios using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical data. Scenario I use a traditional approach, where training and validation data are sourced from the same eruption event. In Scenario II, the spatial transfer scenario, we simulate the absence of local training data by using data from different volcanoes. In Scenario III, the spatial–temporal transfer scenario, we include training data from past eruptions of the target volcano in addition to other events. Our results demonstrate that Scenario I achieve the highest classification accuracy, with Random Forest and XGBoost consistently outperforming SVM, achieving f1-scores exceeding 0.90. Scenario III improves average model performance compared to Scenario II (Δf1-score – 0.12), highlighting the value of historical eruption data for enhancing classification accuracy in data-scarce environments. These findings underscore the critical role of integrating EO data and machine learning in advancing volcanic impact mapping, offering a scalable and efficient approach to support disaster management efforts globally."

 Excessive groundwater pumping is a significant driver of land deformation, potentially threatening regional geological stability. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been widely used to monitor such deformation. However, existing studies primarily focus on retrieving InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) or ground vertical deformation, limiting insights into three-dimensional (3D) ground displacements driven by subsurface processes. To address this, we propose a novel approach for modeling 3D surface displacement by integrating dual-orbit Multi-Temporal InSAR measurements with multiple prior deformation models. Specifically, we first estimate two sets of 3D displacements using a Bayesian approach by integrating dual-orbit InSAR measurements into prior models. Subsequently, bidirectional matching is employed to identify reliable homologous points, which are then used to reconstruct the complete horizontal displacement fields through the surface horizontal force equilibrium equation. Following the proposed methodology, for multi-track and high-coherence data, minimum acceleration (MinA) combination, multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI), and burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) techniques can serve as alternatives to conventional approaches. Moreover, incorporating along-track motion will further enhance 3D deformation estimation using SAR data. In the Lorca basin, Spain, we utilized Sentinel-1A ascending and descending SAR images to construct high-precision 3D cumulative displacement fields between October 7, 2015, to March 24, 2017. The experimental results reveal a maximum cumulative subsidence of 121.5 mm and notable horizontal displacements with a peak magnitude of 18.6 mm, a component that has received limited attention in earlier studies. The proposed approach eliminates the need for ground-based observations and yields improvements of 33.7 %, 51.3 %, and 43.9 % in the accuracy of vertical, east–west, and north–south deformation components, respectively, compared to the SMVCE method that integrates both InSAR and GNSS data. This study addresses the low sensitivity of InSAR in monitoring north–south displacement induced by groundwater extraction, offering new evidence to elucidate deformation mechanisms and providing valuable implications for sustainable groundwater management and geohazard mitigation."

 Spatiotemporal fusion is recognized as a feasible approach for reconstructing high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing imagery. The recently proposed ROBust OpTimization-based (ROBOT) fusion model has attracted attention for its efficiency, accuracy, and simple parameterization, and has been applied to seamless global data cube reconstruction. However, its sliding-window strategy often leads to block artifacts, while cloud contamination in auxiliary images further degrade the reconstruction quality and reliability. To address these limitations, this study proposes an improved version of ROBOT (iROBOT). By replacing fixed rectangular patches with spectrally and spatially homogeneous segments, iROBOT effectively suppresses block artifacts and better preserves structural details. In addition, an adaptive gap-filling strategy is applied to temporally nearest auxiliary images prior to fusion, and a low-quality information detection module is introduced to filter unreliable cloud-contaminated data from the regression and residual allocation steps, thereby enhancing reliability under cloud contamination. A total of 28 experiments conducted across two representative areas demonstrate that iROBOT consistently outperforms ROBOT, OL-HSTFM, and FSDAF under both cloud-free and cloud-contaminated scenarios. Moreover, compared with ROBOT, iROBOT exhibits superior capability in selecting reliable information from multi-temporal auxiliary images, with its accuracy advantage becoming more pronounced as the number of auxiliary inputs increases, and with notably enhanced robustness in cloud-prone environments. These findings highlight the potential of iROBOT for improving the accuracy of global-scale spatiotemporal image reconstruction.

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a powerful proxy for vegetation photosynthesis. However, its broader application remains constrained by the insufficient understanding and quantification of canopy spatial heterogeneity. We used the 3D discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate SIF. Heterogeneous and homogeneous canopies were compared to quantify the impact of canopy spatial configuration on total leaf-emitted SIF (SIFtotal) and hemispherically integrated top-of-canopy SIF (SIFhemi). Angular effects were examined by comparing top-of-canopy SIF (SIFtoc) with SIFtotal estimated at different viewing angles. We also compared the relationships of simulated SIFtotal and SIFtoc with fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and vegetation indices (VIs). In addition, we evaluated the relationships between the coefficient of variation (CV) of VIs and SIF, and developed a correction function for estimating heterogeneous-canopy SIF using homogeneous-canopy SIF. The results reveal that (1) both SIFtotal and SIFhemi are significantly higher in homogeneous than in heterogeneous canopies; (2) estimating SIFtotal from SIFtoc effectively reduces angular dependency; (3) SIFtotal exhibits the strongest correlation with fAPAR, while SIFtoc aligns better with NIRv and EVI; and (4) VI-derived CVs are negatively correlated with SIF, with CVNIRv and CVEVI at 10 m resolution demonstrating robust performance in fitting the ratio of heterogeneous-to-homogeneous canopy SIF, validating the proposed correction function. This study highlights the critical role of canopy structural heterogeneity in shaping SIF and presents an approach to convert homogeneous-canopy SIF to heterogeneous-canopy conditions, offering a novel pathway toward more accurate SIF estimation and application."

 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) based on microwave remote sensing has become an essential indicator for monitoring large-scale vegetation conditions. The relatively long-term record of satellite-based passive C-band observations offers the potential for assessing dynamic vegetation changes. Due to the limited operational lifetime of individual microwave sensors, retrieving a long-term C-band VOD (C-VOD) dataset often requires combining multiple sensors, such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS Aqua (AMSR-E, 2002–2011), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2, 2012–present) and WindSat (2003–2020). Retrieving a long-term C-VOD from their C-band brightness temperature (TB) observations faces two major challenges: (i) non-negligible systematic biases exist between the TB observations among the three sensors; (ii) TB from different sensors may not be strongly associated, especially in tropical forests with small seasonal variations. To address these challenges, we employed a combined inter-calibration method, using linear regression in sparse vegetation and linear rescaling in dense vegetation, to merge TB from three sensors. Results showed that: (i) in undisturbed dense forests where minimal emissivity variation can be assumed, the merged TB (2002–2022) exhibited strong temporal correlations with skin temperature (H polarization: R = 0.90, V polarization: R = 0.86); (ii) the merged C-VOD retrieved from the merged TB exhibited substantially improved temporal consistency across three sensors, reducing global discrepancies between AMSR-E and AMSR2 from 6.20 % to 0.34 %. Furthermore, the merged C-VOD showed stable long-term consistency across sensors, with paired t-tests indicating no significant differences (P-value > 0.01) at the global and vegetation-type scales, confirming reliable cross-sensor continuity; (iii) the merged C-VOD showed stronger temporal correlations with normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and site-level gross primary production across more vegetated areas globally, and exhibited higher and more stable spatial correlations with vegetation variables across sensor transitions compared to the existing merged C-VOD product."

 Multirobot Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has become a hot spot all over the world while there still exist some key issues to be addressed for collaborative mapping, especially for heterogenous platforms. This paper presents a self-designed LiDAR-inertial-mapping system on lightweight manned helmet and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platforms. A stable-triangular-descriptor-based place recognition method is proposed to detect overlap between varied field of view (FoV), followed by a Delaunay verification to restrain the global similarity.

 California experiences hundreds of wildfires each year, posing increasing risks to ecosystems and communities. This study investigates how hydrometeorological drivers influence wildfire occurrence and severity across four ecological zones from 2000 to 2023, using satellite imagery and in situ data. Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD), Pseudo–Tri-Dimensional CEEMD, and Time-Dependent Intrinsic Correlation (TDIC) were applied to decompose short- and long-term variability, and Intensity–Duration–Frequency (IDF) curves were utilized to characterize event intensity and duration. Results show that wildfire severity has increased statewide even as occurrence rates diverged regionally. In the Sierra, the number of fires declined by approximately 25 %, yet the average daily burned area doubled, indicating fewer but more destructive events. In the North Coast, fire frequency decreased after 2010, but severity continued to rise, while the Central and South Coasts experienced more frequent ignitions that peaked around 2018. TDIC-based analysis revealed that wildfire occurrence decreases sharply with higher precipitation (≈ −0.7) and soil moisture (≈ −0.8), while hot and dry conditions strongly amplify fire activity, with temperature (≈ +0.8) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD; ≈ +0.6) emerging as dominant drivers. Vegetation greenness, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), exerted contrasting effects: in the Sierra, dense summer biomass fueled larger fires once dried (+0.7), whereas in the South Coast, senescent grasses supported more ignitions (−0.8). IDF analysis further demonstrated that two- to five-day events often reached daily intensities exceeding 500,000 ha, while longer events accumulated greater total burned areas despite lower daily rates. These findings provide quantitative evidence that wildfire–climate interactions in California are region-specific and increasingly shaped by hotter, drier conditions, underscoring the need for adaptive fire management tailored to both short-term extremes and long-term fuel dynamics."

 Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and heavy rainfall can trigger landslide events hundreds or even thousands of times in a given area. Therefore, rapid and efficient intervention in affected regions is essential. Existing studies have demonstrated good detection performance using optical remote sensing images; however, optical data has significant limitations under cloud cover. Moreover, current multi-modal fusion methods struggle to effectively capture the nonlinear interactions between different modes when processing data with large informational disparities. To address these issues, we developed the China Luding multi-modal landslide dataset, which includes optical and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. We also propose a multi-modal network for landslide detection based on multi-label classification, called multi-modal cross Swin Transformer network (MCSTNet). Additionally, a new weighted asymmetric loss function (WASL) is proposed to improve multi-label classification tasks. Our proposed network consists of two stages: feature extraction and feature fusion. In the first stage, two independent branches extract high-level semantic features from optical and PolSAR images. In the second stage, a multi-modal cross multi-head self-attention (MCMSA) mechanism fuses the high-level semantic features from the multi-modal information. Therefore, the model enhances the learning and feature representation capabilities through parallel processing the input data information in different representation subspaces. Compared to other recent landslide detection methods, our results indicate that the proposed method is more effective, achieving an F1 score of 88.24% for landslide detection, with greater accuracy in identifying landslide-prone areas. Therefore, our model can provide reliable and effective decision support for disaster emergency responses."

 Rapid expansion of China’s aquaculture ponds (APs) has significantly contributed to food security and economic development, yet simultaneously triggering ecological degradation. However, the absence of high-resolution national datasets has constrained systematic analyses of APs’ spatiotemporal dynamics and their transboundary environmental footprints. To fill this gap, we developed a robust approach for accurately monitoring APs across China and elucidating the spatiotemporal dynamics and underlying mechanisms driving their changes. The Optical-SAR Aquaculture Pond Mapper (OS-APM) was developed, a novel framework integrating spatiotemporal-spectral signatures to synergistically leverage multi-sensor time series for precision AP mapping. The OS-APM comprised a hierarchical segmentation strategy for large-scale AP delineation, multi-modal feature fusion to distinguish spectrally ambiguous classes, and an ensemble classifier integrating optical, SAR, geometric, and topographic features. The framework achieved individual-pond-scale extraction accuracy (OA > 90 %) and generated China’s first 10-m resolution annual AP dataset (China_AP), derived from 119,882 Sentinel-1 and 579,436 Sentinel-2 scenes (2016–2023). This dataset revealed previously undocumented spatiotemporal patterns, indicating a 2023 AP inventory of 19,919.52 km2, with inland systems (55.56 %) now surpassing coastal ones (44.44 %) to dominate China’s aquaculture landscape. Spatially, four provinces (Jiangsu, Hubei, Shandong, Guangdong) collectively host 56 % of national APs, with 58 % clustered in the Yangtze-Huaihe River corridors. Temporally, the AP area exhibited an inverted-U trajectory, increasing from 20,685.20 km2 (2016) to a peak of 23,256.84 km2 (2019), then contracting below initial levels to 19,919.52 km2 by 2023. This reversal strongly correlates with China’s ecological civilization initiatives, notably the 2017 Aquaculture Water and Tidal Flat Plan. This study establishes multi-sensor data for national AP monitoring, quantifies inland AP expansion patterns under policy regulation, and delivers a scientific foundation for reconciling aquaculture intensification with wetland conservation."

 Arctic lake color and quality are changing in response to the warming climate, permafrost degradation, and intensifying disturbances. These changes have important implications on carbon and nutrient cycling, wildlife habitat, and water resources planning. However, the drivers, spatial distribution, and long-term trajectories of these changes remain poorly characterized on regional scales (∼100 km). In this study, we examined over 3,000 lakes in part of the Mackenzie Delta, Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, and adjacent upland tundra in the Northwest Territories, Canada, to quantify both gradual and abrupt changes in lake color using harmonized Landsat time series from 1985 to 2022. Across the region, we found average declines of surface reflectance in the red and green bands by 13 % and 15 % over the last four decades, respectively. In comparison, the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) trends differed between sub-regions, with a decadal increase in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands and a decrease in the Mackenzie Delta. We identified a positive, lagged correlation between abrupt lake color change and mean summer air temperature (MSAT), particularly in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands (R = 0.7, lag = 2 years), indicating a delayed impact of warm summers on lake color. One important mechanism of such impact was lakeshore thaw slumping intensified by rising summer temperatures, with slump-affected lakes experiencing abrupt increases in surface reflectance and NDTI driven by sediment input. We identified fire as another important driver of lake color dynamics, which led to greater changes in lake surface reflectance (p < 0.01) and NDTI (p = 0.1) compared to surrounding lakes. These findings demonstrate the value of harmonized Landsat time series for characterizing multifaceted Arctic lake color dynamics, along with their drivers and impacts."

 Gaseous air pollutants pose significant threats to environmental quality and public health, with their diurnal variation patterns critically determining human exposure and health risks. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving factors of these variations remain insufficiently understood at the national level. This study characterizes the diurnal variation of four key pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, and O3), using hourly observations from 1636 monitoring stations across China spanning 2014–2024. By integrating a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we quantified the non-linear contributions of meteorological, topographic, and socioeconomic drivers to pollutant variability, with the robustness of the results verified through spatial sensitivity analysis. The results reveal pronounced spatial and seasonal heterogeneity in diurnal ranges. Specifically, SO2 is shaped by the synergy of socioeconomic and meteorological factors; NO2 is dominated by socioeconomic intensity but amplified by plateau meteorology; CO is driven by high-frequency emission cycles such as traffic patterns; and O3 is strictly regulated by solar radiation and topography. These findings elucidate the distinct roles of emission intensity, atmospheric stability, and chemical processing in shaping diurnal cycles, underscoring the necessity of region-specific and time-targeted mitigation strategies to minimize population exposure and advance precision air-quality management."

 To advance the understanding of the characteristics and photochemical processes of VOCs in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), an intensive field measurement campaign was conducted at an island site (Da Wan Shan Island, DWS) in winter, using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). A total of 133 VOC species were identified, with a mean total VOC mixing ratio of 8.2 ± 5.3 ppbv. Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), particularly CxHyO1 (55.0 %) and CxHyO2 (21.0 %) dominated the VOCs. Although the level of total VOCs was lower at DWS than that typically observed in the inland Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, distinct temporal and diurnal variations of VOCs were found in scenarios of different air masses (i.e., continental outflow (Scenarios A1 and A2) and marine air masses (Scenario A3)), which had undergone different degrees of photochemical processes. This indicated different photochemical evolutions and sources of VOCs. The source apportionment results of PMF with the input of initial (IC-PMF) and observed concentrations (OC-PMF) were compared to further evaluate the influence of photochemical consumption on the source apportionment results. We found that photochemical oxidation not only causes changes in VOC concentration and composition but also affects the source characteristics of VOCs. Through the IC-PMF results, vehicle + solid fuel combustion and liquid petroleum gas (LPG)-related emissions had higher contributions in continental outflow air masses of Scenarios A1 (12.6 % and 21.1 %) and A2 (16.9 % and 13.9 %), but only 3.3 % and 4.1 % in marine air masses (Scenarios A3), indicating that anthropogenic sources remain significant in PRD and PRE. Our study shows that outflow air masses from the PRD region has been through active photochemical processes, which can degrade the air quality over PRE, emphasizing the urgent need for mitigation of VOC emissions to reduce the photochemical pollution in this region."

 Diesel exhaust is key contributor to the atmospheric fine particles and surface ozone (O3) in China. Upgradation and replacement of aged diesel vehicles would be potential pathways for further improvement of air quality in China. The present study was conducted to evaluate the improvement of air quality by upgradation of aged diesel vehicles in less developed city in Northwest China. It was found that concentrations of PM2.5 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in diesel exhaust were up to 10,000 and 100 times of that in atmosphere, respectively. Ethylene, ethane, acetaldehyde, propylene, acetylene, and acetone are typical markers in the diesel exhaust. After upgradation, PM2.5 and VOCs were reduced by 66.8 % and 24.0 %, respectively. The reduction efficiencies of PM2.5 were found to be positive to the loading of fine particles in the diesel exhaust before upgradation. Due to reduction of VOCs, the ozone formation potential and SOA formation potential were estimated to be reduced by 52.0 %–71.0 % and 9.0 %–93.0 %, respectively. The present study indicated high reduction efficiency of PM2.5, VOCs, and NOx would be expected in the repairing and upgradation of the aged and high emission diesel vehicles, and upgradation or replacement of aged diesel vehicles would be one of the most effective ways for further improvement of air quality in the less developed areas."

Siesler;Hongkan Wu;Run Zhao,Analysis of odor and VOCs pollution in industrial parks of central inner Mongolia autonomous region based on mobile monitoring,"•Stable atmospheric conditions caused peak odor levels on winter and summer nights. •Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3) were identified as the dominant odorants. •Odor emissions primarily originated from biopharmaceutical and food/feed sectors. •The biopharmaceutical sector contributed most to H2S emissions and odor activity. •Trimethylamine and methanethiol were key odorants from food/feed operations. 
 Odor and volatile organic compound (VOC) pollution were characterized through a 15-month mobile monitoring campaign (January 2024–March 2025) in the Tuoketuo Industrial Park, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, an area experiencing frequent odor complaints. A portable multi-sensor odor analyzer was deployed across ambient routes, Priority Monitoring Zones (PMZs), and 52 Priority Regulated Enterprises (PREs), covering a total distance of 4072 km. The monitoring results indicated that mean odor unit (OU, dimensionless) values were higher in PMZs at night (10.2) than during the day (8.3) and on ambient routes (7.08). Seasonal peaks occurred in summer (July–August) and winter (December), corresponding to periods of low wind speeds and temperature inversions. Spatial analysis identified recurrent odor hotspots along J Avenue (night-time anomaly probability 65 %) and at the H Street–F Road intersection (48 %). Ammonia (NH3; peak 10 mg m−3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S; peak 7.85 mg m−3), and trimethylamine (TMA) were the dominant odorants, associated mainly with biopharmaceutical, coal-chemical, corn-processing and wastewater treatment activities. Although total VOC (TVOC) concentrations were low (0.11–0.15 mg m−3), odor activity values (OAVs) highlighted TMA and methanethiol (MM) as key contributors to perceived odor impact. These findings support targeted night-time enforcement in high-risk corridors and optimization of waste-gas treatment, and motivate the adoption of OAV-based odor management beyond mass-based TVOC metrics."

 Exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases (RD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The abundant epidemiological evidence on the health effects of air pollution often focuses on individual pollutants, rather than complex mixtures of simultaneous exposure to multiple air pollutants. Traditional statistical approaches to investigate the effects of air pollution often predict the health outcome of a specific pollutant, and control for confounding by other pollutants. This is a limitation which could result in an underestimation of the health risks. Recently, the application of Machine Learning (ML) has been used to predict the health effects of complex air pollution mixtures. The aim of this study was to use unsupervised ML clustering methods to determine the joint effects of SO2, NO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10 on hospital admissions for RD and CVD in the Vaal Triangle Airshed Priority Area (VTAPA), South Africa.Due to the missing air pollution from January 2011 to February 2020, data were imputed using the multiple imputation by chain equations (mice) method. K-means and spectral clustering methods were then applied to the air pollution data.A three-cluster spectral clustering model using the normalised Laplacian matrix, showed that the risk of RD hospital admission increased when exposed to SO2, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 in higher concentration levels, and lower levels of O3 by 1.04 (95 % CI 1.01–1.08). No cluster models showed an increased risk of CVD hospitalisation.Although the clustering methods used in this study were quick to run and analyse, it is evident that more studies need to be done before considering unsupervised ML a reliable and definite tool to study joint effects of air pollution on different health outcomes."

 Microphysics parameterization strongly influences precipitation formation in numerical weather and climate models. This study evaluates three double moment microphysics schemes in the convection permitting WRF ARW model, including Jensen ISHMAEL (JIS), Thompson (TH), and WRF Double Moment 7 class (WDM7), for summer precipitation over Northwestern China using a 4 km simulation for 2009 to 2011. The evaluation, based on IMERG satellite data and surface observations, focuses on spatial distribution, diurnal cycle, hydrometeor structure, and thermodynamic conditions. All three schemes reproduce the major precipitation bands along the Tianshan, Qilian, and Kunlun Mountains, though with wet biases at high elevations and dry biases in the Tarim and Qaidam Basins. For diurnal variations, all schemes capture the characteristic double-peak cycle, with WDM7 providing the most accurate peak timing, TH performing moderately, and JIS showing a delayed, overly strong afternoon peak. Hydrometeor analysis shows that JIS and TH generate deeper, more continuous ice-phase layers in the mid- to upper troposphere, supporting persistent precipitation development. WDM7 produces noticeably weaker mid-level ice content, limiting sustained ice-phase growth. Thermodynamic responses indicate that JIS and TH modify local instability and moisture through stronger latent heating feedbacks, whereas WDM7 exhibits lower atmospheric moisture and instability and a higher lifting condensation level, creating conditions less favorable for deep convection. Among the three schemes, WDM7 exhibited the smallest wet bias and most effectively reduces the overestimation of mountain precipitation present in the JIS and TH simulations. These findings highlight the importance of microphysics selection for improving high resolution precipitation simulation over complex terrain."
