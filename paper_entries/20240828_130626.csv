10.5194/essd-2024-331,EARice10: A 10 m Resolution Annual Rice Distribution Map of East Asia for 2023,"We designed to generate the 10 m resolution rice distribution map of EA in 2023 (EARice10). The generated EARice10 has an OA of 90.48 % on the validation samples, showing good consistency with statistical data and existing datasets, with R2 values ranging between 0.94 and 0.98 with statistical data, and between 0.79 and 0.98 with existing datasets. Moreover, EARice10 is the most up-to-date rice distribution map that comprehensively covers four rice production countries of EA in 10 m resolution. 
 Timely and accurate high-resolution annual mapping of rice distribution is essential for food security, greenhouse gas emissions assessment and supporting for sustainable development goals. East Asia (EA), a major global rice-producing region, accounts for approximately 29.3 % of the world's rice production. Therefore, to acquire the latest rice distribution of the EA, this study proposed a novel rice distribution mapping method based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, producing a 10-meter-resolution annual rice distribution map (EARice10) of EA for 2023. A new Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based Rice distribution Mapping Index (SRMI) was firstly proposed and combined with optical indices to generate representative rice samples. In addition, a stacking-based optical-SAR adaptive fusion model was designed to fully integrate the features of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for high-precision rice mapping in EA. The accuracy of EARice10 was evaluated using more than 90,000 validation samples and achieved an overall accuracy of 90.48 %, with both user’s and producer’s accuracies exceeding 90 %. The reliability of the product was verified by an R2 values ranging between 0.94 and 0.98 with respect to official statistics, and between 0.79 and 0.98 with respect to previous rice mapping products. EARice10 is accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13118409 (Song et al., 2024).",Mingyang Song;Lu Xu;Ji Ge;Hong Zhang;Lijun Zuo;Jingling Jiang;Yinhaibin Ding;Yazhe Xie;Fan Wu,Earth System Science Data Discussions,False,[],这篇论文的主题是关于水稻种植区域的遥感制图，而不是大气环境遥感。论文中提到的遥感技术主要用于识别和绘制水稻种植区域，使用了合成孔径雷达（SAR）和光学遥感数据，并结合机器学习方法进行分类。研究的目标是生成高分辨率的水稻分布图，用于农业统计、粮食安全评估和可持续发展目标的监测。
10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00473,Enhanced Organic Nitrate Formation from Peroxy Radicals in the Condensed Phase,"Organic alkoxy (RO) and peroxy (RO2) radicals are key intermediates in multiphase atmospheric oxidation chemistry, though most of the study of their chemistry has focused on the gas phase. To better understand how radical chemistry may vary across different phases, we examine the chemistry of a model system, the 1-pentoxy radical, in three phases: the aqueous phase, the condensed organic phase, and the gas phase. In each phase, we generate the 1-pentoxy radical from the photolysis of n-pentyl nitrite, run the chemistry under conditions in which RO2 radicals react with NO, and detect the products in real time using an ammonium chemical ionization mass spectrometer (NH4+ CIMS). The condensed-phase chemistry shows an increase in formation of organic nitrate (RONO2) from the downstream RO2+NO reaction, which is attributed to potential collisional and solvent-cage stabilization of the RO2–NO complex. We further observe an enhancement in the yield of carbonyl relative to hydroxy carbonyl products in the condensed phase, indicating changes to RO radical kinetics. The different branching ratios in the condensed phase impact the product volatility distribution as well as HOx-NOx chemistry, and may have implications for nitrate formation, aqueous aerosol formation, and radical cycling within atmospheric particles and droplets.",Victoria P.
