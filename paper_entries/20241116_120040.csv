10.1088/1748-9326/ad8589,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是使用生命周期评估法分析不同有机肥料的温室气体排放量，重点关注的是牛粪和草-苜蓿混合厌氧消化产生的肥料对全球变暖的影响。研究比较了未经处理的牛粪、厌氧消化产生的消化液、消化液分离出的液相和富含氮硫的液体产品等不同肥料的碳足迹。虽然研究涉及到甲烷（CH4）等大气成分的排放，但这与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等并没有直接关系。该研究主要关注的是农业生产过程中肥料的温室气体排放，其数据来源是生命周期评估，而非大气环境遥感技术。,[],Xiaoyi Meng;Marie Trydeman Knudsen;Søren O Petersen;Henrik B Møller;Fatemeh Hashemi,Climate impact of alternative organic fertilizers using life cycle assessment,"Anaerobic digestion is a common method for managing liquid manure and other biomasses, generating biogas as a renewable energy source. The resulting digestate can be processed into organic fertilizers to enhance nutrient recycling, but its environmental impact warrants investigation. In this study, a life cycle assessment was conducted to examine the impact of fertilizers derived from cattle slurry and grass–clover co-digestion on global warming (measured in CO2 equivalents) compared to untreated cattle slurry (CA). The different treatments analyzed include CA, digestate, liquid fractions (LFs) from digestate separation, and an enriched liquid nitrogen–sulfur product derived from post-processing of biogas and drying of the solid fraction. The functional units of this study were 100 kg of total nitrogen in the final organic fertilizer (FU1) with the cradle-to-processing gate boundary, and the harvesting of 1 ton of spring barley dry matter (FU2) with the cradle-to-field application boundary. The carbon footprint ranged from 24% to 49% of the baseline scenario for FU1, and from −6% to 177% of the baseline scenario for FU2. The main contributors to the carbon footprint of fertilizers included greenhouse gas emissions from storage and field application. However, biogas production from anaerobic digestion, together with the concurrent mitigation of CH4 emissions during storage, contributed most to a reduction in the overall global warming potential associated with anaerobic digestate and its LF. This study showed large climate prospects in replacing untreated slurry as organic fertilizer with alternatives resulting from its anaerobic digestion and post-treatment."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad89df,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究海洋热浪对浅层和中上层热带珊瑚礁的影响。研究人员建立了一个模型，以每日的精度模拟1993年5月6日至2023年10月31日期间9944个热带珊瑚礁（深度0-60米）的珊瑚白化现象。他们发现，与表层珊瑚礁相比，深层珊瑚礁经历的热应激和白化现象更严重。该研究结果表明，利用海表温度数据模拟深层珊瑚白化会低估白化强度。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析，没有直接关系。,[],Nicolas Colombi;Chahan M Kropf;Friedrich A Burger;David N Bresch;Thomas L Frölicher,Modelling marine heatwaves impact on shallow and upper mesophotic tropical coral reefs,"Coral reefs ecosystems, often compared to rain forests for their high biodiversity, are threatened by ocean warming causing coral bleaching when the symbiotic relationship between dinoflagellates and corals breaks under high ocean temperatures. Thermal stress from marine heatwaves (MHWs) occur both at the surface and subsurface with subsurface MHWs lasting longer with potentially higher cumulative intensities. However, global coral bleaching models generally ignore the differences in thermal stress between surface and sea-bed levels. Here, we define MHWs at sea-bed level to model coral bleaching with daily resolution from 6 May 1993 to 31 October 2023, for 9944 tropical coral reefs between 0 and 60 m depths. We show that deeper reefs experience on average higher thermal stress and bleaching compared to surface reefs. Using surface temperature data to model bleaching for deeper corals underestimates bleaching intensities by an average of 6% ± 9% compared to the subsurface calibrated model. Our study is a starting point for more accurate coral bleaching modelling, providing additional evidence to reshape our perception of deeper coral reefs as potential refugees from climate change."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8b5e,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了西北地区夏季降水的变化及其水汽来源。研究利用CAM5.1模式结合大气水汽追踪算法，对西北地区40年的降水进行了模拟，结果表明，当地蒸发以及来自北亚、欧洲、青藏高原南部和华南等陆地水汽来源是西北地区夏季降水的主要来源（占总降水量的77%），而非海洋水汽。研究还发现，西北地区夏季降水量的波动主要受北亚直接水汽输送和青藏高原南部再蒸发输送的影响。总的来说，该研究关注的是陆地水汽循环对西北地区降水的影响，并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。,"['water vapor', 'precipitation', 'moisture sources', 'atmospheric transport', 'numerical modeling']",Peng Qian;Bin Zhu;Tong Zhu;Chenwei Fang;Chunsong Lu;Haishan Chen;Hong Liao,Terrestrial moisture sources dominate summer precipitation fluctuations in Northwest China,"Northwest China (NWC), is characterized by its arid and semi-arid environment, and exhibits high sensitivity to precipitation variations. Recent research indicates a wetting tendency over NWC, yet quantifying its moisture source remains challenging. Here, employing a 40 year simulation with Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1 (CAM5.1) coupled to an atmospheric water tracer algorithm, we ascertain that the dominant source of summer moisture over NWC are from terrestrial sources (82% of vapor and 77% of precipitation), i.e. from local evaporation, North Asia (NA), Europe (EUP), the southern Tibetan Plateau (STP), and southeastern China (SEC), rather than oceanic sources. Favorable synoptic patterns over NWC enhance the precipitation-conversion efficiency from the southeasterly airflow transport (STP and SEC) compared to northwesterly airflow (NA and EUP). We also find that the fluctuations in precipitation over NWC, manifesting as alternating dry and wet summers, are primarily driven by increased moisture contributions from direct inputs from NA and re-evaporation transport from STP. Our study indicates that moisture variability in inland is predominantly driven by nearby terrestrial sources and underscores the complex mechanisms of terrestrial moisture transport."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8bde,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是季节性预报在农业决策中的应用，特别是关于秋季施肥和干旱应对。研究使用了北美多模式集合（NMME）的再分析数据和VIC-CropSyst耦合模型来预测气温和径流，评估了预报结果对农业决策的辅助作用。其关注点在于预报的准确性和提前期，而非大气环境遥感技术本身。因此，虽然研究中使用了气象数据，但这些数据并非通过遥感技术获取，也并非直接用于大气成分分析或空气质量监测。文章主要关注的是如何利用现有的季节性预报来改进农业生产实践，与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['temperature', 'precipitation', 'drought', 'seasonal forecasting', 'NMME', 'VIC-CropSyst model', 'agricultural decision-making']",Ashish Kondal;Katherine Hegewisch;Mingliang Liu;John T Abatzoglou;Jennifer C Adam;Bart Nijssen;Kirti Rajagopalan,Seasonal forecasts have sufficient skill to inform some agricultural decisions,"Seasonal forecasts, which look several months into the future, are currently underutilized in active decision-making, particularly for agricultural and natural resource management. This underutilization can be attributed to the absence of forecasts for decision-relevant variables at the required spatiotemporal resolution and at the time when the decisions are made and a perception of poor skill by decision-makers. Addressing these constraints, we quantified the skill of seasonal forecasts in informing two agricultural decisions with differing decision timeframes and influencer variables: (a) whether to apply fertilizer in fall or wait until spring based on expected winter temperatures, and (b) drought response, such as whether to lease water based on expectations of drought. We also looked into how early the forecast can be provided without significant degradation in skill. Currently, drought response decisions are typically formulated in April, utilizing drought forecasts issued in the same month, while fall fertilization decisions are generally made between August and September. There is growing interest among stakeholders in the availability of earlier forecasts to inform these critical choices. We utilized the North American multi-model ensemble (NMME) hindcasts for the time period 1982–2020 over the Pacific Northwest US (PNW) to obtain meteorological variables. Runoff was estimated via simulations of the coupled crop-hydrology VIC-CropSyst model. The skill assessment with the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) yielded promising outcomes in both decisions for the entire PNW region. Notably, NMME’s positive skill (median HSS of 30%) in predicting warmer winters identifies years when fertilizer application should be avoided to prevent fertilizer loss through mineralization (and associated costs). Similarly, there is skill in forecasting drought conditions in most irrigated watersheds for up to two months in advance of April, the current decision time. In conclusion, our findings affirm that contrary to the perception of low skill and resulting underutilization, current seasonal forecasts hold the potential to inform at least some key agricultural decisions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8c65,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了中国，特别是北京市的空气污染（PM2.5）及其健康影响，并探讨了脱碳政策对改善空气质量和公共卫生的潜在益处。虽然文中没有直接提及具体的遥感技术或卫星传感器类型，但其研究主题与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。例如，对PM2.5浓度时空分布的分析需要依赖于地面监测站数据和卫星遥感数据；论文中关于污染源贡献的分析也需要利用大气成分分析技术。因此，这项研究与大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和卫星观测等方面具有很强的关联性。,"['PM2.5', 'air pollution', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'health effects', 'decarbonization policies']",Gregor Kiesewetter;Shaohui Zhang;Jun Liu,Health benefits of decarbonization and clean air policies in Beijing and China,"Although China has seen strong reductions in air pollution levels in the last decade, PM2.5 concentrations still exceed the WHO Guideline several times, causing a substantial burden of mortality and morbidity. With many ‘low hanging fruits’ in terms of abatement measures already taken, further improvements will be more difficult and likely require different strategies than pursued so far. This study looks into the trends expected under current energy policies and air pollution control legislation and analyses the source contributions to ambient PM2.5 in China, with a special focus on the megacity of Beijing. Although reductions are foreseen, China appears not yet on track to meet its long-term targets for greenhouse gas emissions nor the future national air quality standards. Going beyond current policies, we analyze effects of measures which tackle both issues and quantify health co-benefits from further decarbonization policies required to meet the national target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060, as well as the potential for further air pollution mitigation."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8f49,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文关注的是区域气候变化归因问题，探讨了全球尺度人为因素（主要是CO2的直接影响）和区域尺度驱动因素对观测到的区域变暖的贡献程度。文中使用了HadCRUT4数据集和全球辐射强迫序列数据进行回归分析，量化了不同区域全球和区域尺度气候驱动因素对温度变化的贡献。结果表明，在某些区域，全球人为变暖（主要由CO2直接影响引起）对观测到的变暖的贡献有限，而区域驱动因素和局部反馈机制起着更重要的作用。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为卫星观测和大气成分分析（例如CO2浓度）是获取温度变化和辐射强迫数据的重要手段，而区域气候模式则依赖于这些数据进行模拟和分析。因此，该研究间接地利用了遥感技术获取的数据，并为改进区域气候模式和更准确地预测区域气候变化提供了信息。,"['Temperature change', 'CO2', 'Regional climate modeling', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Climate change attribution']",Armineh Barkhordarian,Disentangling regional climate change: assessing the contribution of global- and regional-scale anthropogenic factors to observed regional warming,"While the influence of uniformly-distributed well-mixed greenhouse gas emissions on global warming is well-documented and robustly attributed through multiple lines of evidence, regional attribution remains more challenging and dependent on the performance and resolution of climate models. This study investigates the extent to which observed regional temperature trends are attributable to global-scale anthropogenic factors, mainly the direct effects of CO2, aiming to differentiate the portion of the change attributable to regional-scale drivers and local feedback mechanisms. To quantify the contribution of global- and regional-scale climate drivers to observed temperature change, I conducted regression analyses using the observed temperature change in HadCRUT4 and the global warming index derived from global radiative forcing series. Results indicate that in certain regions—specifically West Asia, East N. America, West Africa, and the Amazon— 7%, 61 13%, 58 7%, and 61 10% of the warming observed over 1991–2020 can be attributed to global anthropogenic warming, primarily the direct effects of CO2. The remaining portion, which represents 22 8%, 21 16%, 27 9%, 23 14% of the observed warming, is attributable to regional drivers. The Mediterranean showcases high sensitivity, with regional drivers contributing 31 13% of the observed 1.2 C warming, amplifying the warming attributed to global anthropogenic drivers, estimated at 55 ± 10%. The Arctic Ocean along with the Russian-Arctic region exhibits a substantial contribution from regional drivers and local feedback mechanisms (the indirect effects of CO2) to the observed warming amplification, quantified at 43 ± 15% of the 3 ∘C warming over 1991–2020. Regional cooling drivers, however, are significant in East Asia and the Tibetan Plateau, with the latter experiencing a cooling contribution of 17%. By breaking down the contributions of climate drivers into global and regional-scale components, we gain valuable insights into the local climate mechanisms responsible for the observed regional warming, which is a crucial factor that affects agriculture, ecosystems and societies."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8f4b,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了热带海表温度异常的季节性演变模式及其与南极海冰异常的联系。研究使用自组织映射方法识别和分析了1854年至2022年热带海洋季节性海表温度演变的主要模式，并预测了21世纪这些模式频率的变化。此外，还研究了过去40年南极海冰浓度与这些热带海表温度模式的季节性变化关系。研究发现，热带海表温度异常表现出均匀和偏移的季节性演变模式，并且La Niña到El Niño以及El Niño到La Niña模式转换的频率预计在未来气候中会增加。有趣的是，几乎镜像的海表温度季节性演变模式并没有导致南半球中高纬度地区完全相反的大气环流异常，也没有导致完全相反的南极海冰覆盖异常。总的来说，该研究关注气候变化背景下热带海表温度与南极海冰之间的遥相关关系，使用了长期海表温度和海冰数据，但与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等关系不大。,"['sea surface temperature', 'sea ice concentration', 'climate variability', 'teleconnection', 'satellite observations']",Lejiang Yu;Shiyuan Zhong;Bo Sun,Seasonal evolution modes of tropical sea surface temperature anomalies and their links to antarctic sea ice anomalies,"Previous studies have explored the teleconnections between variability of Antarctic sea ice cover and tropical sea surface temperature (SST) across the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins, typically focusing on each basin individually. However, there has been limited investigation into the impact of tropical SSTs—particularly from a seasonal evolution perspective—on Antarctic sea ice cover. In this study, we employ the self-organizing map method to identify and analyze the primary modes of seasonal SST evolution in the tropical oceans from 1854 to 2022. We also project changes in the frequency of these modes through the 21st century. Moreover, we examine the seasonal variability of Antarctic sea ice concentration in relation to these tropical SST modes over the past four decades. Our results reveal that tropical SST anomalies display both uniform and shifted seasonal evolution patterns. Notably, the frequency of switched modes—namely, transitions from La Niña to El Niño (node 8) and from El Niño to La Niña (node 3)—is expected to increase in future climate. Interestingly, nearly mirrored SST seasonal evolution patterns do not lead to entirely opposite atmospheric circulation anomalies in the southern mid-high latitudes, nor do they result in completely inverse Antarctic sea ice cover anomalies."
10.5194/acp-24-12707-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了深对流云中冰晶的单散射特性。研究人员开发了两种理想化的冰晶形状模型（高斯随机球体和droxtal），并通过组合这两种模型创建了混合模型。他们利用几何光学方法计算了这些模型的单散射特性（相函数和不对称因子），并与实测数据进行了比较。结果表明，混合模型比单一模型更能准确地模拟实测数据，这对于改进深对流云中冰晶单散射特性的计算具有重要意义。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它可以提高对云辐射特性和气候模型的模拟精度，而这些模型通常依赖于卫星观测数据来反演云的微物理特性。,"['cloud microphysics', 'ice crystals', 'deep convective clouds', 'radiative properties', 'scattering properties', 'satellite remote sensing', 'cloud properties retrieval']",Jeonggyu Kim;Sungmin Park;Greg M. McFarquhar;Anthony J. Baran;Joo Wan Cha;Kyoungmi Lee;Seoung Soo Lee;Chang Hoon Jung;Kyo-Sun Sunny Lim;Junshik Um,Improved calculation of single-scattering properties of frozen droplets and frozen-droplet aggregates observed in deep convective clouds,"We developed idealized models to represent the shapes of ice particles found in deep convective clouds and calculated their single-scattering properties. By comparing these results with in situ measurements, we discovered that a mixture of shape models matches in situ measurements more closely than single-form models or aggregate models. This finding has important implications for enhancing the simulation of single-scattering properties of ice crystals in deep convective clouds. 
 During multiple field campaigns, small quasi-spherical ice crystals, commonly referred to as frozen droplets (FDs), and their aggregates (frozen-droplet aggregates, FDAs) have been identified as the predominant habits in the upper regions of deep convective clouds (DCCs) and their associated anvils. These findings highlight the significance of FDs and FDAs for understanding the microphysics and radiative properties of DCCs. Despite the prevalence of FDs and FDAs at the tops of DCCs where they directly contribute to cloud radiative effect, the detailed single-scattering properties (e.g., scattering-phase function P11 and asymmetry parameter g) of FDs and FDAs remain highly uncertain. This uncertainty is mainly due to insufficient in situ measurements and the resolution of cloud probes, which hinder the development of idealized shape models for FDs and FDAs. In this study, two shape models, the Gaussian random sphere (GS) and droxtal (DX), are proposed as possible representations for the shapes of FDs and FDAs measured in situ. A total of 120 individual models of GSs and 129 models of DXs were generated by varying their shapes. Furthermore, by attaching these individual models in both a homogeneous and heterogeneous manner, three different types and a total of 404 models of FDAs were created: (1) aggregates of GSs; (2) aggregates of DXs; and (3) combinations of GSs and DXs, which are called habit mixtures (HMs). The P11 and g values of the developed models were calculated using a geometric optics method at a wavelength of 0.80 µm and then compared with those obtained using a polar nephelometer (PN) during the CIRCLE-2 field campaign to assess the models. Both individual-component ice crystals (i.e., either GS or DX) and homogeneous-component aggregates (i.e., either aggregates of GSs or aggregates of DXs) showed substantial differences compared with the PN measurements, whereas the P11 of the HMs was found to most accurately match the P11 measured in situ, reducing the differences to +0.87 %, +0.88 %, and −5.37 % in the forward-, lateral-, and backward-scattering regions, respectively. The g value of the HMs was found to be 0.80, which falls within the range of the PN measurement (0.78 ± 0.04). The root-mean-square error for the HM was minimized to a value of 0.0427. It was shown that the novel HMs developed in this study demonstrated better performance than in previous research where HMs were developed indirectly by weighting the calculated P11 of shape models to interpret in situ measurement. The results of this study suggest potential implications for enhancing the calculation of single-scattering properties of ice crystals in DCCs."

Beer;Ulrike Burkhardt;Anja Schmidt,Revealing dominant patterns of aerosol regimes in the lower troposphere and their evolution from preindustrial times to the future in global climate model simulations,"Aiming to understand underlying patterns and trends in aerosols, we characterize the spatial patterns and long-term evolution of lower tropospheric aerosols by clustering multiple aerosol properties from preindustrial times to the year 2050 under three SharedSocioeconomic Pathway scenarios. The results provide a clear and condensed picture of the spatial extent and distribution of aerosols for different time periods and emission scenarios. 
 Aerosols play an important role in the Earth system, but their impact on cloud properties and the resulting radiative forcing of climate remains highly uncertain. The large temporal and spatial variability of a number of aerosol properties and the choice of different “preindustrial” reference years prevent a concise understanding of their impacts on clouds and radiation. In this study, we characterize the spatial patterns and long-term evolution of lower tropospheric aerosols (in terms of regimes) by clustering multiple instead of single aerosol properties from preindustrial times to the year 2050 under three different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. The clustering is based on a combination of statistic-based machine learning algorithms and output from emissions-driven global aerosol model simulations, which do not consider the effects of climate change. Our analysis suggests that in comparison with the present-day case, lower tropospheric aerosol regimes during preindustrial times are mostly represented by regimes of comparatively clean conditions, where marked differences between the years 1750 and 1850 emerge due to the growing influence of agriculture and other anthropogenic activities in 1850. Key aspects of the spatial distribution and extent of the aerosol regimes identified in year 2050 differ compared to preindustrial and present-day conditions, with significant variations resulting from the emission scenario investigated. In 2050, the low-emission SSP1-1.9 scenario is the only scenario where the spatial distribution and extent of the aerosol regimes very closely resemble preindustrial conditions, where the similarity is greater compared to 1850 than 1750. The aerosol regimes for 2050 under SSP3-7.0 closely resemble present-day conditions, but there are some notable regional differences: developed countries tend to shift towards cleaner conditions in future, while the opposite is the case for developing countries. The aerosol regimes for 2050 under SSP2-4.5 represent an intermediate stage between preindustrial times and present-day conditions. Further analysis indicates a north–south difference in the clean background regime during preindustrial times and close resemblance of preindustrial aerosol conditions in the marine regime to present-day conditions in the Southern Hemispheric ocean. Not considering the effects of climate change is expected to cause uncertainties in the size and extent of the identified aerosol regimes but not the general regime patterns. This is due to a dominating influence of emissions rather than climate change in most cases. The approach and findings of this study can be used for designing targeted measurements of different preindustrial-like conditions and for tailored air pollution mitigation measures in specific regions."
10.5194/acp-24-12687-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了夏季NO2总柱浓度的逐小时变化，以及这种变化对地球静止轨道卫星观测的影响。研究者利用GEOS-Chem模型，结合美国境内的飞机和地面观测数据，以及欧美亚地区的Pandora日照光度计数据，对NO2总柱浓度的逐小时变化进行了分析。结果表明，Pandora数据经过修正后，模型对NO2总柱浓度逐小时变化的模拟精度有所提高。研究发现，总柱浓度的逐小时变化比地表浓度弱，这主要是因为有效温度的逐小时变化、Pandora视线方向上太阳时变化以及不同大气层NO2变化差异等因素造成的。该研究对理解地球静止轨道卫星观测的NO2数据至关重要，因为它揭示了NO2总柱浓度与地表浓度之间逐小时变化的关系，这对于提高空气质量监测的精度具有重要意义。,"['NO2', 'air quality monitoring', 'geostationary satellite', 'atmospheric composition', 'Pandora sun photometer', 'GEOS-Chem model', 'aircraft measurements', 'ground-based measurements']",Deepangsu Chatterjee;Randall V.

Cede,Interpreting summertime hourly variation  of NO2 columns with implications for  geostationary satellite applications,"We investigate the hourly variation of NO2 columns and surface concentrations by applying the GEOS-Chem model to interpret aircraft and ground-based measurements over the US and Pandora sun photometer measurements over the US, Europe, and Asia. Corrections to the Pandora columns and finer model resolution improve the modeled representation of the summertime hourly variation of total NO2 columns to explain the weaker hourly variation in NO2 columns than at the surface. 
 Accurate representation of the hourly variation in the NO2-column-to-surface relationship is essential for interpreting geostationary observations of NO2 columns. Previous research indicated inconsistencies in this hourly variation. This study employs the high-performance configuration of the GEOS-Chem model (GCHP) to analyze daytime hourly NO2 total columns and surface concentrations during summer. We use measurements from globally distributed Pandora sun photometers and aircraft observations over the United States. We correct Pandora total NO2 vertical columns for (1) hourly variations in effective temperature driven by vertically resolved contributions to the total column and (2) changes in local solar time along the Pandora line of sight. These corrections increase the total NO2 columns by 5–6 × 1014 molec. cm−2 at 09:00 and 18:00  across all sites. Fine-scale simulations from GHCP (∼12 km) reduce the normalized bias (NB) against Pandora total NO2 columns from 19 % to 10 % and against aircraft measurements from 25 % to 13 % in Maryland, Texas, and Colorado. Similar reductions are observed in NO2 columns over the eastern US (17 % to 9 %), the western US (22 % to 14 %), Europe (24 % to 15 %), and Asia (29 % to 21 %) when compared to 55 km simulations. Our analysis attributes the weaker hourly variability in the total NO2 column to (1) hourly variations in column effective temperature, (2) local solar time changes along the Pandora line of sight, and (3) differences in hourly NO2 variability from different atmospheric layers, with the lowest 500 m exhibiting greater variability, while the dominant residual column above 500 m exhibits weaker variability."

In these Doppler spectra, several peaks can be formed due to populations of droplets/ice particles with different fall velocities coexisting in the same measurement time and height. The two algorithms can detect peaks and assign them to certain particle types, such as small cloud droplets or fast-falling ice particles like graupel. 
 Cloud radar Doppler spectra are of particular interest for investigating cloud microphysical processes, such as ice formation, riming and ice multiplication. When hydrometeor types within a cloud radar observation volume have different terminal fall velocities, they can produce individual Doppler spectrum peaks. The peaks of different particle types can overlap and be further broadened and blended by turbulence and other dynamical effects. If these (sub-)peaks can be separated, properties of the underlying hydrometeor populations can potentially be estimated, such as their fall velocity, number, size and to some extent their shape. However, this task is complex and dependent on the operation settings of the specific cloud radar, as well as atmospheric dynamics and hydrometeor characteristics. As a consequence, there is a need for adjustable tools that are able to detect peaks in cloud radar Doppler spectra to extract the valuable information contained in them. This paper presents the synergistic use of two algorithms used for analyzing the peaks in Doppler spectra: PEAKO and peakTree. PEAKO is a supervised machine learning tool that can be trained to obtain the optimal parameters for detecting peaks in Doppler spectra for specific cloud radar instrument settings. The learned parameters can then be applied by peakTree, which is used to detect, organize and interpret Doppler spectrum peaks.The application of the improved PEAKO–peakTree toolkit is demonstrated in two case studies. The interpretation is supported by forward-simulated cloud radar Doppler spectra by the Passive and Active Microwave TRAnsfer tool (PAMTRA), which are also used to explore the limitations of the algorithm toolkit posed by turbulence and the number of spectral averages chosen in the radar settings.From the PAMTRA simulations, we can conclude that a minimum number of n = 20–40 spectral averages is desirable for Doppler spectrum peak discrimination. Furthermore, small liquid peaks can only be reliably separated for eddy dissipation rate values up to approximately 0.0002 m2 s−3 in the simulation setup which we tested here.The first case study demonstrates that the methods work for different radar systems and settings by comparing the results for two cloud radar systems which were operated simultaneously at a site in Punta Arenas, Chile. Detected peaks which can be attributed to liquid droplets agree well between the two systems, as well as with an independent liquid-predicting neural network. The second case study compares PEAKO–peakTree-detected cloud radar Doppler spectrum peaks to in situ observations collected by a balloon-based holographic imager during a campaign in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. This case demonstrates the algorithm toolkit's ability to identify different hydrometeor types but also reveals its limitations posed by strong turbulence and a low n.Despite these challenges, the algorithm toolkit offers a powerful means of extracting comprehensive information from cloud radar observations. In the future, we envision PEAKO–peakTree applications on the one hand for interpreting cloud microphysics in case studies. The identification of liquid cloud peaks emerges as a valuable asset, e.g., in studies on cloud radiative effects, in seeder–feeder processes, or for tracing vertical air   motions. Furthermore, the computation of the moments for each subpeak enables the tracking of hydrometeor populations and the observation of growth processes along fallstreaks.

 Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important greenhouse gas modified by human activities after carbon dioxide and methane. This study examines the feasibility of airborne differential absorption lidar to measure N2O concentration enhancements over agricultural, fossil fuel combustion, industrial,  and biomass burning sources. The mid-infrared spectral region, where suitably strong N2O absorption lines exist, challenges passive remote sensing by means of spectroscopy due to both low solar radiation and thermal emission. Lidar remote sensing is principally possible thanks to the laser as an independent radiation source but has not yet been realized due to technological challenges. Mid-infrared N2O absorption bands suitable for remote sensing are investigated. Simulations show that a spectral trough position between two strong N2O lines in the 4.5 µm band is the favored option. A second option exists in the 3.9 µm band at the cost of higher laser frequency stability constraints and less measurement sensitivity. Both options fulfill the N2O measurement requirements for agricultural areal or point-source emission quantification (0.5 % measurement precision, 500 m spatial resolution) with technically realizable and affordable transmitter (100 mW average laser power) and receiver (20 cm telescope) characteristics for integrated-path differential absorption lidar that measures the column concentration beneath the aircraft. The development of an airborne N2O lidar is feasible yet would benefit from progress in infrared laser transmitter and low-noise-detection technology. It will also serve as a precursor to space versions,  which are still out of reach due to the lack of space technology."

This work proposes a new process to obtain reliable data products with high coverage by reconstructing the raw data from multiple satellites. The results are validated in terms of traditional methods as well as variance maximization and demonstrate a good ability to reproduce known polluted and clean areas around the world. 
 Remote sensing based on satellites can provide long-term, consistent, and global coverage of NO2 (an important atmospheric air pollutant) as well as other trace gases. However, satellites often miss data due to factors including but not limited to clouds, surface features, and aerosols. Moreover, as one of the longest continuous observational platforms of NO2, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has suffered from missing data over certain rows since 2007, significantly reducing its spatial coverage. This work uses the OMI-based tropospheric NO2 (OMNO2) product as well as a NO2 product from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) in combination with machine learning (eXtreme Gradient Boosting – XGBoost) and spatial interpolation (data-interpolating empirical orthogonal function – DINEOF) methods to produce the 16-year global daily High Spatial–Temporal Coverage Merged tropospheric NO2 dataset (HSTCM-NO2; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10968462; Qin et al., 2024), which increases the average global spatial coverage of NO2 from 39.5 % to 99.1 %. The HSTCM-NO2 dataset is validated using upward-looking observations of NO2 (multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy – MAX-DOAS), other satellites (the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument – TROPOMI), and reanalysis products. The comparisons show that HSTCM-NO2 maintains a good correlation with the magnitudes of other observational datasets, except for under heavily polluted conditions (> 6 × 1015 molec.cm-2). This work also introduces a new validation technique to validate coherent spatial and temporal signals (empirical orthogonal function – EOF) and confirms that HSTCM-NO2 is not only consistent with the original OMNO2 data but in some parts of the world also effectively fills in missing gaps and yields a superior result when analyzing long-range atmospheric transport of NO2. The few differences are also reported to be related to areas in which the original OMNO2 signal was very low, which has been shown elsewhere but not from this perspective, further confirming that applying a minimum cutoff to retrieved NO2 data is essential. The reconstructed data product can effectively extend the utilization value of the original OMNO2 data, and the data quality of HSTCM-NO2 can meet the needs of scientific research."

Autonomous eDNA samplers that can sample water at high frequencies offer potential solutions to these problems. We present results from four case studies using a prototype autonomous eDNA sampler as part of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Rapid Environmental eDNA Assessment and Deployment Initiative & Network (READI-Net) project. These case studies involved short-term deployments of an eDNA autosampler (Smith-Root) across a range of riverine habitats with the objectives of (a) identifying what insights could be gained from high-frequency autosampling and (b) benchmarking these autosamples against manually collected samples. The high frequency autosampling revealed high temporal variability of eDNA concentrations and provided valuable insights about eDNA associations with environmental covariates, such as discharge and turbidity. Benchmarking assessments indicated autosamples had similar detection rates to manual samples and obtained similar or greater eDNA quantities. We did find minimal carryover contamination in autosampler field controls. We conclude that eDNA autosamplers have potential to improve freshwater biosurveillance by reducing logistical sampling barriers, standardizing collection methods, and clarifying the influence of environmental covariates on eDNA results."

However, the impact of freeze–thaw cycle events on its storage capacity, particularly on the release of dissolved black carbon (DBC), has remained poorly investigated. This study investigated the release behavior of DBC from biochar pyrolyzed at 300–700 °C during freeze–thaw cycles and their retention capacity in soil. Freeze–thaw cycles dramatically promoted DBC release (33.08–230.74 mg C L–1), exhibiting an order of magnitude higher than those without freeze–thaw process. The release kinetics of freeze–thaw-induced DBC varied depending on the pyrolysis temperature of biochar due to the different disintegration mechanisms. Interestingly, the retention capacity of freeze–thaw-induced DBC in soil showed a reduction ranging from 7.7 to 29.5% compared to DBC without the freeze–thaw process. This reduction can be attributed to numerous hydrophilic low-molecular-weight compounds (16.97–75.31%) in freeze–thaw-induced DBC, as evidenced by the results of size exclusion chromatography, fluorescence excitation/emission matrix, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance. These compounds tend to concentrate in the aqueous phase rather than being retained in the soil, potentially exacerbating the outflow of dissolved organic carbon. These findings clarify the release behavior of DBC during freeze–thaw cycles and reveal their contribution to the attenuation of carbon pools in cold regions."

Soils inherit many properties from the parent material, yet the influence of lithology and associated soil geochemistry on microbial CUE and necromass stabilization remains unknow. Here, we quantified microbial CUE in well-aggregated bulk soils and crushed aggregates, as well as microbial necromass in bulk soils and the mineral-associated organic matter fraction, originating from carbonate-containing (karst) and carbonate-free (clastic rock, nonkarst) parent materials along a broad climatic gradient. We found that aggregate crushing significantly increased microbial CUE in both karst and nonkarst soils. Additionally, compared to nonkarst soils, calcium-rich karst soils increased macroaggregate stability and decreased the ratio of oligotrophic to copiotrophic microbial taxa, leading to a reduction in microbial CUE. Moreover, microbial CUE was negatively associated with iron (hydr)oxides in karst soils, attributed to the greater abundance of iron (hydr)oxides and higher soil pH. Despite the negative effects of soil aggregation and minerals on microbial CUE, particularly in karst soils, these soils concurrently showed greater microbial necromass stability through organo–mineral associations compared to nonkarst soils. Consequently, (i) bedrock lithology mediates the effects of aggregates and minerals on microbial CUE and necromass stability; and (ii) balancing minerals’ dual roles in diminishing microbial CUE and enhancing microbial necromass stability is vital for optimizing soil C preservation."

This study leverages satellite data and chemistry‐transport models to analyze the impact of wildfires on trace gases in California during the August‐October periods of 2018, 2019, and 2020. During these months, Southern California experiences minimal precipitation, leading to a high Vapor Pressure Deficit, which results in decreased photosynthetic activities. This reduction, combined with increased biomass burning, causes a rise in CO2 concentrations. Increased CO and CH4 levels are also seen in TROPOMI retrievals tied to the increase in biomass burning. The CarbonTracker model captures these elevated CO2 concentrations, though with a reduced amplitude of increased CO2. Similarly, the GEOS‐Chem model successfully simulates high CO levels but underestimates the observed enhancements.

Uranus' thermosphere appears to be more strongly governed by the solar wind than any other planet where we have assessed this coupling so far. Uranus' total auroral power may also have declined, in contrast with the power of the radio aurora that we expect has been predominantly modulated by the solar cycle.

10.1029/2024JD041405,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了亚热带地区中层水汽平流层上形成的薄型过冷液态层状云的局部形成特征。研究使用了地面水汽拉曼激光雷达、偏振激光雷达、云雷达和常规探空仪等多种大气环境遥感技术，对为期两年的观测数据进行了分析。结果表明，这些云主要在冬季0℃等温线高度较低时出现，多形成于水汽平流层顶部，该层顶部存在强烈的温度逆温，水汽混合比较低。这种温度和湿度结构的特殊组合导致了狭窄的冷湿饱和水层。研究还发现，少数情况下，过冷液态层状云会形成在水汽平流层底部或中部，那里温度逆温和湿度逆温同时出现。两个具体的案例研究说明了与水汽平流层相关的 mesoscale 气象环境变化如何决定薄型过冷液态云层的出现与否。总的来说，该研究利用多种遥感技术手段深入探究了特定大气条件下云的微物理特性和形成机制，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['cloud properties', 'water vapor', 'temperature', 'humidity', 'lidar', 'radar', 'radiosonde', 'atmospheric aerosols', 'cloud remote sensing', 'meteorological environment']",Yang Yi;Fan Yi;Kaiming Huang;Fuchao Liu;Yunpeng Zhang;Changming Yu;Yun He;Zhenping Yin,"Locally Formed Thin Supercooled Liquid Stratiform Clouds on Mid‐Level Moisture Advection Layers as Observed by Ground‐Based Lidars, Radar, and Radiosondes at a Subtropical Site","The local formation characteristics of thin supercooled liquid stratiform clouds on mid‐level moisture advection layers have been revealed by the ∼2‐year observations from routinely operating ground‐based water vapor Raman Lidar, polarization Lidar, cloud radar, and conventional radiosondes at a subtropical site. These moisture advection layers were commonly observed during all seasons over our subtropical site, whereas thin supercooled liquid stratiform clouds occurred mainly in winter when the 0°C isotherm level occurred at lower altitudes. It was determined that these clouds mostly formed on the top of moisture advection layers capped by strong temperature inversions. The temperature‐moisture structure collocation (the layer's upper edge with modest/low water vapor mixing ratio of ∼2–5 g kg−1 occurred at the base of the temperature inversion) therein produced a narrow cool‐moist water saturation layer. This collocation with a temperature inversion but no moisture inversion was peculiar to the upper boundary of the moisture advection layers. A relative minority (∼33%) of thin supercooled liquid stratiform clouds formed on the bottom or middle part of the moisture advection layers, where a moisture inversion coincided with a temperature inversion. Within the corresponding water saturation layer, the relative humidity peaked at the top of the coincided moisture inversion and temperature inversion, indicating warm‐moist air mass advection.

10.1029/2023JD040490,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了南极昭和基地附近大气中大振幅惯性重力波的特性。它利用PANSY雷达数据和ERA5再分析数据，对2015年10月至2016年9月期间的大振幅惯性重力波事件进行了分析，重点关注其绝对动量通量。研究发现，惯性重力波在平流层中以向下的相速度为主导，其垂直波长随高度降低，而固有周期和水平波长随高度增加。此外，其在平流层中主要向南传播。论文比较了PANSY雷达和ERA5再分析数据的结果，发现ERA5再分析数据低估了动量通量，尤其是在5到12.5公里高度之间以及更高的高度上。这种低估可能与ERA5较大的垂直网格间距以及在平流层中占主导地位的重力波较短的垂直波长有关。该研究使用了遥感技术（PANSY雷达）以及再分析数据（ERA5），对大气动力学，特别是平流层中的重力波进行了分析，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['gravity waves', 'momentum flux', 'wind', 'stratospheric dynamics', 'radar', 'reanalysis data', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing']",L.

Focusing on large‐amplitude events with large absolute momentum flux (AMF), hodograph analysis was applied to both data to estimate the wave parameters. It showed that the inertia GWs with a downward phase velocity becomes dominant in the stratosphere. Although their vertical wavelengths got shorter with altitude, their intrinsic periods and horizontal wavelengths got longer with altitude. In addition, their southward propagation was predominant in the stratosphere. Although height dependence of the estimated wave parameters is consistent with previous studies investigating inertia GWs over Syowa Station, some features specific to large‐amplitude inertia GWs were also observed. The GW features obtained from PANSY were mostly consistent with those from ERA5 except for their amplitudes. Comparison of AMF between PANSY and ERA5 indicated that ERA5 significantly underestimated the AMF by a factor of 5 between 5 and 12.5 km altitudes and more above 12.5 km. Difference of horizontal and vertical wind power spectra between PANSY and ERA5 is quantitatively consistent with the difference of AMF and its height dependence. It was found that underestimation of vertical wind spectra primarily contributed to the underestimation of AMF in ERA5. The greater underestimation of AMF in the stratosphere might be due to larger vertical grid spacing in ERA5 and the shorter vertical wavelengths of the dominant GWs in the stratosphere."

We quantify the fraction of models that project future increases or decreases in the frequency and amplitude of ENSO, IOD, and SAM events in the late 21st century. Changes to the frequency of co‐occurring and consecutive driver phases are also examined. We find that while there is large inter‐model spread, the most common pathways correspond to more frequent ENSO events; weaker, less frequent IOD events; and stronger, but less frequent austral spring SAM events. There is no clear consensus on the change to the frequency of concurrent events, though we find a significant increase in La Niña‐ and El Niño‐only events occurring with neutral IOD and SAM. We also find a significant increase to the frequency of consecutive positive IOD events under a high emissions scenario, but no significant change to the frequency of consecutive ENSO or negative IOD events. In most models, the correlation between drivers, that is, ENSO and IOD, and ENSO and SAM, does not significantly change between the late 20th and late 21st century.

 Unravelling the volcanic history of the enigmatic lunar farside is essential for understanding the hemispheric dichotomy of the Moon1-3. Cratering chronology established for the lunar nearside has been used to suggest long-lived volcanism on the farside of the Moon3,4, but without sample verification. Here we report two newly recognized episodes of basaltic volcanism with Pb-Pb dating for basalt fragments returned by the Chang’e-6 mission. One high-Al basalt fragment dated at 4,203 ± 4 million years ago (Ma) has a source 238U/204Pb ratio (µ value) of ~1,620, implying a KREEP-rich (K, rare earth elements, and P) source for this oldest-known occurrence of basaltic volcanism among returned samples. The main volcanic episode of the Chang’e-6 basalt documents a surprisingly young eruption age of 2,807 ± 3 Ma, which is not recognized from the nearside of the Moon. The initial Pb isotope compositions of these younger basalts indicate derivation from a source with a µ value of ~360, indicating a KREEP-poor mantle source. Mare volcanism on the lunar farside thus persisted for >1.4 billion years even with a shift to a source depleted in heat-producing elements. The consistency between the 2.8-billion-year basalt age and its crater-counting age indicates that the cratering chronology model established for the lunar nearside is also applicable to the farside of the Moon."

 Severe air pollution reduces ecosystem carbon assimilation through the vegetation damaging effects of ozone and by altering the climate through aerosol effects, exacerbating global warming. In response, China implemented the Clean Air Action plan in 2013 to reduce anthropogenic emissions. Here we assess the impact of air pollution reductions due to the Clean Air Action plan on net primary productivity (NPP) in China during the period 2014–2020 using multiple measurements, process-based models and machine learning algorithms. The Clean Air Action plan led to a national NPP increase of 26.3 ± 27.9 TgC yr−1, of which 20.1 ± 10.9 TgC yr−1 is attributed to aerosol reductions, driven by both the enhanced light availability as a result of decreased black carbon concentrations and the increased precipitation caused by weakened aerosol climatic effects. The impact of ozone amelioration became more important over time, surpassing the effects of aerosol reduction by 2020, and is expected to drive future NPP recovery. Two machine learning models simulated similar NPP recoveries of 42.8 ± 26.8 TgC yr−1 and 43.4 ± 30.1 TgC yr−1. Our study highlights substantial carbon gains from controlling aerosols and surface ozone, underscoring the co-benefits of regulating air pollution for public health and carbon neutrality in China.

 Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) is a major phospholipid constituent of intralumenal membranes in late endosomes/lysosomes, where it regulates the degradation and sorting of lipid cargo. Recent observations suggest that the Batten disease-associated protein CLN5 functions as lysosomal BMP synthase. Here, we show that transacylation reactions catalyzed by cytosolic and secreted enzymes enhance BMP synthesis independently of CLN5. The transacylases identified in this study are capable of acylating the precursor lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG), generating acyl-PG, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to BMP. Extracellularly, acyl-PG and BMP are generated by endothelial lipase in cooperation with other serum enzymes of the pancreatic lipase family. The intracellular acylation of PG is catalyzed by several members of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 group IV (PLA2G4) family. Overexpression of secreted or cytosolic transacylases was sufficient to correct BMP deficiency in HEK293 cells lacking CLN5. Collectively, our observations suggest that functionally overlapping pathways promote BMP synthesis in mammalian cells.

 Bacteria invest significant resources into the continuous creation and tailoring of their essential protective peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall. Several soluble PG biosynthesis products in the periplasm are transported to the cytosol for recycling, leading to enhanced bacterial fitness. GlcNAc-1,6-anhydroMurNAc and peptide variants are transported by the essential major facilitator superfamily importer AmpG in Gram-negative pathogens including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Accumulation of GlcNAc-1,6-anhydroMurNAc-pentapeptides also results from β-lactam antibiotic induced cell wall damage. In some species, these products upregulate the β-lactamase AmpC, which hydrolyzes β-lactams to allow for bacterial survival and drug-resistant infections. Here, we have used cryo-electron microscopy and chemical synthesis of substrates in an integrated structural, biochemical, and cellular analysis of AmpG. We show how AmpG accommodates the large GlcNAc-1,6-anhydroMurNAc peptides, including a unique hydrophobic vestibule to the substrate binding cavity, and characterize residues involved in binding that inform the mechanism of proton-mediated transport.

 Topological superconductivity is a promising concept for generating fault-tolerant qubits. Early experimental studies looked at hybrid systems and doped intrinsic topological or superconducting materials at very low temperatures. However, higher critical temperatures are indispensable for technological exploitation. Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results have revealed that superconductivity in the type-I Weyl semimetal—trigonal PtBi2 (t-PtBi2)—is located at the Fermi-arc surface states, which renders the material a potential candidate for intrinsic topological superconductivity. Here we show, using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, that t-PtBi2 presents surface superconductivity at elevated temperatures (5 K). The gap magnitude is elusive: it is spatially inhomogeneous and spans from 0 to 20 meV. In particular, the large gap value and the shape of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum resemble the phenomenology of high-Tc superconductors. To our knowledge, this is the largest superconducting gap so far measured in a topological material. Moreover, we show that the superconducting state at 5 K persists in magnetic fields up to 12 T.

A threshold for acceptable activity loss between asexual blood stage parasites and gametocytes was defined, with near-equipotent compounds required to prevent continued gametocyte maturation and onward transmission. Target abundance is not predictive of gametocytocidal activity, but instead, lipoidal uptake is the main barrier of dual activity and is influenced by distinct physicochemical properties. This study provides guidelines for the required profiles of potential dual-active antimalarial agents and facilitates the development of effective transmission-blocking compounds. Most compounds active against asexual blood stage malaria parasites show reduced activity against gametocytes. Here the authors directly compare asexual and gametocytocidal activity of 80 compounds and identify physicochemical properties that influence dual activity."

The authors show that these patterns emerge because competition alters the scaling of organismal metabolism with size. 
 Both metabolism and growth scale sublinearly with body mass across species. Ecosystems show the same sublinear scaling between production and total biomass, but ecological theory cannot reconcile the existence of these nearly identical scalings at different levels of biological organization. We attempt to solve this paradox using marine phytoplankton, connecting individual and ecosystem scalings across three orders of magnitude in body size and biomass. We find that competitive interactions determined by biomass slow metabolism in a consistent fashion across species of different sizes. These effects dominate over species-specific peculiarities, explaining why community composition does not affect respiration and production patterns. The sublinear scaling of ecosystem production thus emerges from this metabolic density-dependence that operates across species, independently of the equilibrium state or resource regime. Our findings demonstrate the connection between individual and ecosystem scalings, unifying aspects of physiology and ecology to explain why growth patterns are so strikingly similar across scales. Communities that differ in species size composition show similar relationships between production and biomass, contrary to expectations based on body size allometries.

In this study, the authors examine the landscape patterns of global forest disturbance and their drivers to better inform sustainable forest management and policy. 
 The spatial imprint of forest disturbances, which can result from a variety of anthropogenic and natural causes, is important in shaping the form and function of the world’s forests. However, we lack a systematic assessment of how the forms of forest disturbances differ globally, which could help in sustainable forest policy and management initiatives to protect forest biomes. Here we produce a global-scale quantification of disturbance patch structures. Using indicators of magnitude, complexity and context, we found that the forms of stand-replacing disturbances can be classified into four broad patterns, whose spatial dominance varies across regions. Human activities were shown to introduce disturbance structures that are not naturally common, especially in the tropics. The consistency of these patterns across biomes outside intact forests suggests that a continuation of current dynamics may lead to a structural homogenization of the world’s forests, with potential consequences for forest ecology and functions. These results provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms governing forest dynamics and elucidating the causal agents of disturbances. This will be a key step towards building more reliable projections of future forest conditions, informing policymaking and ensuring the sustainability of forest management.

 Anthropogenic climate change is altering patterns of extreme weather events across the planet, with far-ranging consequences for biodiversity. Increases in the frequency, duration, and severity of droughts are anticipated to substantially impact natural ecosystems. Here, we predicted the extent to which 1221 terrestrial vertebrates in the contiguous United States will be increasingly exposed to annual (12-month) and prolonged (36-month) drought, under three global climate models and two representative concentration pathways. On average, a 377% increase in annual drought exposure and a 579% increase in prolonged drought exposure are anticipated for the study area by 2050–2080, compared to 1950–2005. Species in the southwestern USA could see the largest increases in drought exposure, while this area also has the highest vertebrate diversity and an abundance of drought-threatened species.

 Global warming has led to a notable increase in heatwaves globally and regionally. In spring 2022, South Asia witnessed an unprecedented heatwave with temperatures breaking historical records and exceeding 5° C from climatological mean at several locations in the northern Indian subcontinent. Here, using 3D tracking, this heatwave ranked the most severe in the past 64 years, characterized by its protracted duration and wide spatial extent. The excess atmospheric heat, represented by temperature anomalies, during the mega-heatwave triggered rapid snowmelt across the snow-covered areas in the region, leading to an average loss of 42% in snow cover and 57% in snow depth of the regional snowpack. This rapid melting resulted in the complete disappearance of low-level snowpack in the western Himalayas, Pir Panjal, and Afghanistan highlands, leading to the lowest snowpack observed in the last six decades. Moreover, during the heatwave, the amount of snowfall received was only 29% of the long-term average. This combination of excessive melting and reduced snowfall culminated in a severe regional snow drought in spring 2022. The heatwave genesis lay a persistent high-pressure system over Northwest South Asia, reinforced by a quasi-stationary Rossby wave packet over Europe during the initial spell. Continuous heat from high-pressure ridges associated with circumglobal Rossby waves combined with the physical barrier of the Himalayas, lent staying power to this system during the second phase.

 The conversion of tropical forests in the Amazon region for agriculture and other land uses is associated with health risks linked, for example, to air and water pollution from forest fires and agrochemical use. Several conservation policies introduced in the 2000s aimed at reducing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Here we exploit variations in the regional targeting of these policies to measure human health externalities of conservation policy enforcement using a double-difference approach at close distance to the Amazon biome border. We find that the change in deforestation pressure reduces forest fire incidence. As a consequence, fine particulate matter concentrations in the air—a main vector for adverse health effects of fire smoke—also decrease. This leads to a reduction in the hospitalization and death prevalence rate due to respiratory health problems and other health benefits for the local population.

 Northern forests are an important carbon sink, but our understanding of the driving factors is limited due to discrepancies between dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and atmospheric inversions. We show that DGVMs simulate a 50% lower sink (1.1 ± 0.5 PgC yr−1 over 2001–2021) across North America, Europe, Russia, and China compared to atmospheric inversions (2.2 ± 0.6 PgC yr−1). We explain why DGVMs underestimate the carbon sink by considering how they represent disturbance processes, specifically the overestimation of fire emissions, and the lack of robust forest demography resulting in lower forest regrowth rates than observed. We reconcile net sink estimates by using alternative disturbance-related fluxes. We estimate carbon uptake through forest regrowth by combining satellite-derived forest age and biomass maps. We calculate a regrowth flux of 1.1 ± 0.1 PgC yr−1, and combine this with satellite-derived estimates of fire emissions (0.4 ± 0.1 PgC yr−1), land-use change emissions from bookkeeping models (0.9 ± 0.2 PgC yr−1), and the DGVM-estimated sink from CO2 fertilisation, nitrogen deposition, and climate change (2.2 ± 0.9 PgC yr−1). The resulting ‘bottom-up’ net flux of 2.1 ± 0.9 PgC yr−1 agrees with atmospheric inversions. The reconciliation holds at regional scales, increasing confidence in our results.

 Aerosols from South Asia directly enhance glacier melt over the Tibetan Plateau. While the transboundary transport of aerosols from South Asia towards the Tibetan Plateau has been extensively investigated from a tropospheric perspective, less focus has been given to the stratospheric dimension. Here we examined the impact of the sudden stratospheric warming in January 2021 on aerosol transport from South Asia towards the Tibetan Plateau via numerical simulation. The results revealed that the aerosol transport from South Asia to the Tibetan Plateau reduced by 30%–40% following the January 2021 sudden stratospheric warming event. The eastward-propagating wave train stimulated by the stratospheric sudden warming induced an anticyclonic anomaly from the Persian Gulf to northern China, south of which easterly anomalies hindered the aerosol transport from South Asia to the Plateau. This study provides valuable insights for predicting air quality over the Tibetan Plateau.

 Community Open Spaces (COS) refer to the fine-grained and micro-open areas within communities that offer residents convenient opportunities for social interaction and health benefits. The mapping of COS using Very High Resolution (VHR) imagery can provide critical community-scale data for monitoring urban sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, the three-dimensional structure of COS often results in layered occlusion in two-dimensional satellite imagery, leading to the invisibility and fragmentation of ground COS features in VHR images. This study presents a novel Layered Occlusion Perception Model (LOPM) to address these challenges by accurately modeling and reconstructing the intricate layered structure of COS. Our approach involves the automatic generation of a comprehensive COS database and the joint training of a deep learning network to decompose occlusion relationships. The developed dual-layer map product, COS-1m, includes various elements and their coupled spaces, with a resolution of 1 m, covering 31 major cities in China. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 86.39% and an average F1-score of 77.47% across these cities. COS-1m reveals that, on average, 60.51 km2 of COS area per city is occluded, constituting 10.18% of the total COS area.

 Accurate precipitation estimates are quintessential for hydrologic modeling and climate studies. Different gridded precipitation products are available in any region, and selecting the best one is essential for hydroclimatic modeling and analysis. In the current study, observation- (APHRODITE), reanalysis- (IMDAA, ERA5-Land, PGF), satellite-based (IMERG, CHIRPS, PERSIANN-CDR), and hybrid (MSWEP) gridded precipitation products with different spatial and temporal resolutions are evaluated using several continuous, categorical, graphical, and interval-based performance measures towards detecting Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) events and estimating their magnitudes for the subcontinent of India, considering IMD gauge-based gridded data as reference product. We confine our analysis to the monsoon season (i.e., June to September), the principal rainy season in the Indian sub-continent. The dearth of data and limited rain gauge-based observations from non-uniform sparse monitoring networks across India necessitated grid-to-grid comparative evaluations instead of point-to-grid assessments. We propose a new ranking framework to determine the suitability of precipitation datasets for twenty-seven hydroclimatic regions comprising homogeneous rainfall zones, Köppen-Geiger climate zones, and major river basins. Results from the comprehensive evaluation suggest that (1) APHRODITE, MSWEP, and ERA5-Land best approximate precipitation event occurrences across India, (2) MSWEP and ERA5-Land are most suitable (highest rank) alternatives at the regional level, while APHRODITE is found to be next suitable dataset owing to its persistent dry bias, (3) CHIRPS and IMERG have reasonably lower rank score across India, (4) close agreement of examined datasets is noted over semi-arid and sub-humid regions (e.g., peninsular and central India), whereas ERA5-Land, IMDAA, and APHRODITE fail to detect and reproduce the intensity of the events along the west coast and northeastern India, (5) PGF and PERSIANN-CDR are the least situated datasets. Moreover, the present study provides a unique and innovative perspective to characterise the precipitation over a vast topographic, ecologic, and climatic gradient region like India."

Köhler’s theory explains initial droplet growth but struggles with large particle groups. Here, we present a stochastic, analytical framework building on Köhler’s theory to account for (monodisperse) aerosols and cloud droplet interaction through competitive growth in a limited water vapor field. These interactions are modeled by sink terms, while fluctuations in supersaturation affecting droplet growth are modeled by nonlinear white noise terms. Our results identify hysteresis mechanisms in the droplet activation and deactivation processes.

Rigidity and viscous relaxation have emerged as the main mechanical properties of the ECM steering cell behavior. However, how cells integrate coexisting ECM rigidity and viscosity cues remains poorly understood, particularly in the high-stiffness regime. Here, we have exploited engineered stiff viscoelastic protein hydrogels to show that, contrary to current models of cell-ECM interaction, substrate viscous energy dissipation attenuates mechanosensing even when cells are exposed to higher effective rigidity. This unexpected behavior is however readily captured by a pull-and-hold model of molecular clutch–based cell mechanosensing, which also recapitulates opposite cellular response at low rigidities. Consistent with predictions of the pull-and-hold model, we find that myosin inhibition can boost mechanosensing on cells cultured on dissipative matrices. Together, our work provides general mechanistic understanding on how cells respond to the viscoelastic properties of the ECM."

Upon interaction with CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells, CD40 delivers costimulatory signals alongside B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling to regulate affinity maturation and antibody class switch. Mutations affecting CD40-CD40L interactions cause abnormal antibody responses in immunodeficiencies known as X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (X-HIgM). Here, we study the CD40-mediated mechanotransduction in B cells, which likely occurs during their physical contacts with T cells. We found that CD40 forms catch bond with CD40L that lasts longer at larger forces, both B and T cells exert tension on CD40-CD40L bonds, and force enhances CD40 signaling and antibody class switch. X-HIgM CD40L mutations impair catch bond formation, suppress endogenous tension, and reduce force-enhanced CD40 signaling, leading to deficiencies in antibody class switch. Our findings highlight the role of mechanotransduction in CD40 function and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying X-HIgM syndrome."

We investigated the role of BCAP in B cell response to viral particles and found a previously unidentified mechanism by which BCAP regulates antigen-specific responses. B cell–specific deletion of BCAP in mice leads to decreases in antigen-specific responses through defects in BCR-antigen endocytosis. BCAP is necessary to orchestrate actin reorganization around the antigen for efficient endocytosis through BCR and intracellular processing of antigens. Therefore, loss of BCAP from B cells leads to defects in antigen endocytosis, hampering the propagation of antigen-derived signals and decreasing the ability of B cells to present antigens to T cells.

Nerve terminals are sites of metabolic vulnerability, and we show that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is a critical step in oxidative ATP production in hippocampal terminals. We find that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is post-translationally modified by lysine acetylation, which, in turn, modulates mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. Our data reveal that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier regulates distinct steps in neurotransmission, namely, the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic vesicle release and the efficiency of vesicle retrieval—functions that have profound implications for synaptic plasticity.

Here, we show that disruption of Golgi architecture under TME stress, identified by the decreased expression of GM130, was reverted upon treatment with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor GYY4137 or overexpressing cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of endogenous H2S, which also promoted stemness, antioxidant capacity, and increased protein translation, mediated in part by endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi shuttling of Peroxiredoxin-4. In in vivo models of melanoma and lymphoma, antitumor T cells conditioned ex vivo with exogenous H2S or overexpressing CBS demonstrated superior tumor control upon adoptive transfer. Further, T cells with high Golgi content exhibited unique metabolic and glycation signatures with enhanced antitumor capacity. These data suggest that strategies to mitigate Golgi network stress or using Golgihitumor-reactive T cells can improve tumor control upon adoptive transfer."

However, conventional approaches of achieving intrinsic C points using photonic crystals with broken symmetries suffer from a lowQfactor and high sensitivity to structural geometry, rendering them fragile and susceptible to perturbations and disorders. We report magneto-optical (MO) bound states in the continuum (BICs) with a symmetry-preserved planar photonic crystal. We achieve intrinsic C points at Γ point that are robust against variation in both structural geometry and external magnetic field. MO coupling between two modes induces Zeeman splitting, leading to MO BICs and quasi-BICs with circular eigenstates for high-Qchiral responses. Furthermore, switchable C point handedness and circular dichroism are enabled by reversing the magnetic field. These findings unveil BICs and quasi-BICs with circular eigenstates and on-demand control of C points, paving the way for advanced chiral wave manipulation with enhanced light-matter interaction."
10.1126/sciadv.adq9045,False,Science Advances,这篇研究论文主要关注昆虫胚胎发育过程中基因调控机制的研究。研究人员发现，尽管不同昆虫物种（例如果蝇和棉铃虫）在胚胎分节过程中都遵循“成对规则”，但它们所使用的基因却不同。这表明，发育过程中对“成对规则”这一预先模式化的步骤存在一定的约束，而介导这一过程的因素则可以发生变化。该研究使用了RNA干扰和CRISPR-Cas9技术来研究基因功能，并首次在棉铃虫中获得了“成对规则”基因突变体。总的来说，这项研究属于发育生物学领域，与大气环境遥感技术没有任何关系。,[],Katie Reding;Matthew Chung;Abigail Heath;Julie Dunning Hotopp;Leslie Pick,"Same rule, different genes: Blimp1 is a pair-rule gene in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus","Morphological features of organismal body plans are often highly conserved within large taxa. For example, segmentation is a shared and defining feature of all insects. Screens inDrosophilaidentified genes responsible for the development of body segments, including the “pair-rule” genes (PRGs), which subdivide embryos into double-segment units in a previously unexpected pre-patterning step. Here we show that the milkweed bugOncopeltus fasciatusalso uses a pair rule for embryo subdivision butOncopeltusemploys different genes for this process. We identified the geneBlimp1as anOncopeltusPRG based on its expression pattern, tested its function with RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9, and generated the first PR mutant in this species. Although it does not have PR function inDrosophila, likeDrosophilaPRGs,Blimp1encodes a transcription factor required for embryonic viability. Thus, pair-rule subdivision of the insect body plan is more highly conserved than the factors mediating this process, suggesting a developmental constraint on this pre-patterning step."

This study introduces a CO2capture, storage, and mineralization approach with the utilization of biobased biodegradable chelating agents and seawater. An acidic chelating agent solution is used to increase effective porosity and permeability through enhanced mineral dissolution. For instance, applying an acidicN,N-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-glutamate solution to a porous basalt increased effective porosity by 16% and permeability by 26-fold in 120 hours. Subsequently, alkaline chelating agent–containing seawater improves CO2capture and storage by inhibiting mineralization, thus maintaining injectivity while providing ions for mineralization and further expanding storage space. Last, controlled mineralization is achieved by adjusting chelating agent biodegradation. Promising CO2storage and mineralization capacities two orders higher than current techniques, this approach reduces required reservoir volume while enhancing efficiency."

Although the mechanisms by which morphogens transduce chemical signals have been extensively studied, the roles and regulation of the physical communication between morphogen-receiver cells remain unclear. Here, we show that the Wnt/β-catenin–morphogen gradient, which patterns the embryonic anterior-posterior (AP) axis, generates intercellular tension gradients along the AP axis by controlling membrane cadherin levels in zebrafish embryos. This “mechano-gradient” is used for the cell competition–driven correction of noisy morphogen gradients. Naturally and artificially generated unfit cells, producing noisy Wnt/β-catenin gradients, induce local deformation of the mechano-gradients that activate mechanosensitive calcium channels in the neighboring fit cells, which then secrete annexin A1a to kill unfit cells. Thus, chemo-mechanical interconversion–mediated competitive communication between the morphogen-receiver cells ensures precise tissue patterning."
