This study addresses this gap by proposing a new method to generate seamless climate information from seasonal to decadal time scales. We develop a constraining approach based on ensemble member selection, in which decadal prediction members are selected to match the seasonal forecast ensemble mean of sea surface temperature. The method leverages the higher skill of seasonal predictions in capturing interannual climate variability, particularly El Niño–southern oscillation, to constrain decadal forecasts using the most recent climate information. Results show that the method to constrain decadal predictions improves the forecast skill over the Niño3.4 region up to 12 months and enhances the near-surface temperature predictions over broad parts of the globe, with modest improvements in precipitation. This work highlights the practical potential of combining seasonal and decadal prediction systems and offers a first step toward operational, seamless climate services across monthly to multi-year timescales."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae0056,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注印度洋偶极子（IOD）对热带印度洋（TIO）盐度变化的影响，重点在于中东部TIO（CTIO和ETIO）的盐度异常以及它们与IOD的联系。研究通过观测和模拟，揭示了IOD驱动的盐度在盆地范围内的联系机制，包括CTIO和孟加拉湾西部（BoB）之间的跷跷板模式，以及IOD诱导的海洋波对盐度趋势的影响。该研究旨在提高对IOD引起的水文变率的理解，并支持更好地预测TIO中耦合的海洋-大气动力学。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Ke Huang;Dongxiao Wang;Tingting Zu;M V M D Vithana,IOD-driven seesaw mode of upper-ocean salinity variability in the central and eastern tropical Indian Ocean,"Understanding the mechanisms behind interannual salinity variability in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) is crucial for interpreting its role in regional and global climates. While localized salinity anomalies—particularly in the central and eastern TIO (CTIO and ETIO)—are well-documented, their basin-wide connection under the influence of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) remains unclear. This study advances the salt diagnostics based on leading mode and associated salt budget to robustly reveal the IOD-driven mechanisms on salinity’s basin-wide connections using observation and simulation. Results indicate that a coherent seesaw mode connects CTIO and Western Bay of Bengal (BoB) salinity anomalies during the IOD mature phase (September–November), with its principal component and associated localized salinity anomaly strongly correlated with the Dipole Mode Index. Composite analysis and wave diagnostics reveal two key mechanisms. First, anomalous cyclonic/anticyclonic circulations co-develop in CTIO and BoB during IOD events, driving salt advection aligned with mean salinity gradients and shaping the leading salinity pattern. Second, IOD-induced oceanic waves—both remote and local—jointly generate current anomalies that enhance salinity tendencies. In particular, equatorial easterlies during positive IOD events force upwelling Kelvin waves that propagate into the BoB, reinforcing anticyclonic salt advection and producing high salinity anomalies. Concurrently, local wind over the CTIO drives equatorial upwelling Kelvin and downwelling Rossby waves to constructively strengthen westward equatorial current and southern anticlockwise circulation, leading to anomalous freshening. These findings improve our understanding of IOD-induced hydrological variability and support better predictability of coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics in the TIO."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae03da,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注北极海冰的季节性演变模式及其与热带太平洋海面温度异常的联系。虽然大气条件（如风、辐射）在海冰变化中起作用，但研究的核心在于海冰本身及其与海洋的相互作用，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测大气成分等。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,[],Lejiang Yu;Shiyuan Zhong;Junqiao Feng;Cuijuan Sui,Seasonal evolution patterns of Arctic sea ice and their connection to tropical Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies,"This study applies the self-organizing map method to identify the primary modes of seasonal evolution in Arctic sea ice concentration anomalies from 1979 to 2023. The resulting patterns fall into two broad categories: negative sea ice anomalies, occurring more frequently after 2005, and positive anomalies, more common prior to 2005. Differences among the modes within each category are primarily driven by sea ice variability in the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Labrador Sea, and Greenland Sea during boreal winter and spring. Warmer temperatures, increased longwave radiation, and southerly winds favor reduced sea ice, while cooler conditions and northerly winds support increased ice cover. These atmospheric anomalies are often linked to tropical Pacific sea surface temperature variability, which influences Arctic conditions via poleward-propagating Rossby wave trains triggered by changes in tropical convection. Our findings enhance the basis for seasonal, interannual, and decadal predictions of Arctic sea ice."

Toolan;Joe Adabouk Amooli;Laura J. Wilcox;Bjørn H. Samset;Andrew G. Turner;Daniel M. Westervelt,"Strong intermodel differences and biases in CMIP6 simulations of PM2.5, aerosol optical depth, and precipitation over Africa","Our research explores how well air pollution and rainfall patterns in Africa are represented in current climate models by comparing model data to observations from 1981 to 2023. While most models capture seasonal air quality changes well, they struggle to replicate the distribution of non-dust pollutants and certain rainfall patterns, especially over east Africa. Improving these models is crucial for better climate predictions and preparing for future risks. 
 Poor air quality and precipitation change are strong, rapidly changing, and possibly linked drivers of physical hazards in sub-Saharan Africa. Future projections of sub-Saharan air quality and precipitation remain uncertain due to differences in model representations of aerosol, aerosol–precipitation interactions, and unclear future aerosol emission pathways. In this study, we evaluate the performance of CMIP6 models in simulating PM2.5, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and precipitation over Africa relative to a range of observational and reanalysis products, including novel observational datasets, over the 1981–2023 period. While models accurately capture the seasonal cycle of PM2.5 concentrations over most regions, the concentration magnitudes show strong intermodel diversity. Dust AOD shows a generally accurate seasonal spatial distribution, with multi-model mean (MMM) pattern correlation coefficients within 0.77–0.94, despite strong intermodel diversity in magnitude. Seasonal spatial patterns of non-dust AOD are poorly represented, with MMM pattern correlation coefficients of 0.25–0.58 and the poorest performance during September through November. Emission inventory inaccuracies may explain systematic biases for non-dust AOD fields, with differences in circulation and precipitation patterns, as well as aerosol treatment causing intermodel diversity. The magnitude and annual progression of precipitation over both the east and west African monsoon regions are well captured, though there is poorer performance in simulating the east African monsoon. Biases found relate to the intertropical convergence zone, more apparent over east Africa, and rainfall magnitude, more apparent over west Africa. This evaluation highlights strong intermodel diversity in the representation of African air quality and climate and identifies model performance over sub-Saharan Africa and the reasons behind the biases as critical gaps to address for improving confidence in climate projections."

Riviere;Mélanie Ghysels;Jérémie Burgalat;Georges Durry;Nadir Amarouche;Aurélien Podglajen;Albert Hertzog,Influence of atmospheric waves and deep convection on water vapour in the equatorial lower stratosphere seen from long-duration balloon measurements,"During the first two Strateole 2 campaigns, instruments were flown under super-pressure balloons at between 18 and 20 km altitude for several weeks at the Equator and performed in situ measurements of water vapour. This article describes the methodology used to quantify the modulation of water vapour by atmospheric waves and deep convective cases. This methodology allows us to bring to light the influence of atmospheric waves and extreme deep convection on the observed water vapour anomalies. 
 Most atmospheric species enter the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), a place of interplay between many processes of different scales. Water vapour (H2Ovap) is a key compound in this layer and its entry into the tropical stratosphere is crucial for stratospheric chemistry and climate. We present a methodology based on the calculation of in situ H2Ovap and temperature anomalies to estimate the modulation of H2Ovap due to atmospheric waves and deep convection. H2Ovap data were obtained from in situ measurements of five Pico-Strat Bi Gaz spectrometers that were flown under long-duration balloons during the Strateole 2 campaigns. The calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficients is performed between averaged ERA5 reanalysis temperatures and in situ H2Ovap anomalies. In the case of a monotonic vertical gradient of H2Ovap, the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is high (typically 0.65). For the other flights we highlight lower correlations, due to changes in time of the vertical gradient of stratospheric H2Ovap, and large convective systems overshooting the tropopause. This is the case for one of the flights, which flew over the Raï typhoon (correlation coefficient of 0.31 due to both contributions). Depending on the flights, we also show that for 47 % up to 70 % of the probed nights, H2Ovap anomalies can be explained by atmospheric waves, which highlights the major role played by waves on H2Ovap in the TTL. We also show that long-duration balloon measurements are important in highlighting the overshooting signature of H2Ovap in the upper TTL."

We found that dust pollution could reduce the effectiveness of ammonia emission controls by altering aerosol chemistry. Using field observations and modeling, we showed that dust particles affect nitrate distribution between gas and particle phases. Our findings highlight the need for pollution control strategies that consider both human emissions and dust sources for better urban air quality management. 
 Dust emissions significantly influence air quality and contribute to nitrate aerosol pollution by altering aerosol acidity. Understanding how dust interacts with ammonia emission controls is crucial for managing particulate nitrate pollution, especially in urban environments. In this study, we conducted field measurements of aerosol chemical components and gases across three cities in eastern China during the spring of 2023. By combining an aerosol thermodynamic model with machine learning, we assessed the relative contribution of dust to aerosol pH and its impact on nitrate formation. Our results show that changes in ammonia, in both the gas and particle phases, were the main factors affecting aerosol pH, with dust particles contributing to about 7 % of the total pH variation. During dust events, high concentrations of non-volatile ions increased aerosol pH, leading to higher nitrate levels in the particle phase. Machine learning analysis revealed that extreme dust storms caused a significant change in aerosol pH, enhancing nitrate partitioning. Further simulations indicated that while reducing ammonia emissions is effective in lowering nitrate levels under normal conditions, this effect is significantly reduced in dust-affected environments. Dust particles act as a buffer, reducing the sensitivity of nitrate formation to ammonia emission reductions. These findings emphasize the need to consider dust pollution when designing strategies for controlling particulate nitrate levels and highlight the complex interactions between dust and anthropogenic emissions."

Karydis,The influence of ammonia emission inventories on size-resolved global atmospheric aerosol  composition and acidity,"Ammonia (NH3) is an abundant alkaline gas and key precursor in particulate matter formation. While SO2 and NOx emissions have decreased, global NH3 emissions are stable or rising. This study investigates NH3 emission impacts on size-resolved aerosol composition and acidity using the EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) model, analyzing three emission schemes. Sulfate–nitrate–ammonium aerosols in fine-mode sizes are most sensitive to NH3 changes. Regional responses vary. NH3 buffers aerosol acidity, mitigating pH shifts. 
 Ammonia (NH3) is an abundant alkaline gas in the atmosphere and a key precursor in the formation of particulate matter. While emissions of other aerosol precursors such as SO2 and NOx have decreased significantly, global NH3 emissions are stable or increasing, and this trend is projected to continue. This study investigates the impact of NH3 emission changes on size-resolved aerosol composition and acidity using the atmospheric chemistry–climate model EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). Rather than directly perturbing NH3 emissions, we employ three distinct emission inventories: two bottom-up inventories and one derived using an updated top-down method. The results reveal that sulfate–nitrate–ammonium aerosols in two fine-mode size ranges (0–1 and 1–2.5 µm) show the greatest sensitivity to NH3 emission changes. Regional responses vary depending on the local chemical environment of secondary inorganic aerosols. In “NH3-rich” regions (e.g., East Asia and Europe), the abundance of NH3 partially offsets the effects of reduced NH3 emissions when NOx and SO2 are available, especially for aerosols in the 1–2.5 µm range. This underscores the importance of coordinated control strategies for NH3, NOx, and SO2 emissions. Further, we find that NH3 has a buffering effect in densely populated areas, maintaining aerosol acidity at moderate levels and mitigating drastic pH shifts. While pH changes correlate strongly with NH3 variability, they are also influenced by concurrent changes in SO2 and NOx emissions. These results highlight the critical role of NH3 in shaping aerosol acidity, arguing for size-specific approaches to managing particulate matter."

We compared day-ahead AOD forecast methods and assessed their impact on forecasting clear-sky direct normal irradiance (DNI). While none of the methods accurately forecast DNI within 5 %, most sites showed a DNI deviation within 20 %, especially at sites with urban-industrial aerosols. 
 We used aerosol data from surface-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and day-ahead aerosol optical depth (AOD) forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) to examine the spatiotemporal variations in AOD at selected sites worldwide. We evaluated three methods for day-ahead AOD forecasting: AERONET 1 d (and 2 d) persistence or monthly mean, along with CAMS forecast. High values of daily mean AOD indicates larger day-to-day variability in AOD and lower predictability. Using radiative transfer modeling, we quantify deviations in forecasts of cloud-free direct normal irradiance (DNI) induced by errors in AOD forecasts. The performance of each AOD forecast method in DNI forecast is assessed and compared. Taking into account the characteristic aerosol types at selected locations, we also draw quantitative implications about the reliability and usability of CAMS AOD forecasts for DNI forecasts as alternatives to AOD forecasts based on approaches using ground-based measurements. For example, CAMS forecasts perform better at more sites than AERONET persistence approaches do, among them many urban-industrial aerosol sites. AERONET persistence forecasts AOD with lower errors at dust aerosol sites. To date, none of the forecast methods for AOD discussed here reliably achieve an accuracy of < 5 % deviation in day-ahead forecasts of direct normal irradiation (daily sum), but most of the sites can expect better DNI forecasts with a threshold of 20 % DNI deviation."

The algorithm determined seasonal background aerosol model based on AERONET product, calculated the complex refractive index of the internal mixed aerosol, and combined 6SV2.1 to establish lookup tables to achieve the optimal estimation of BC fraction and column concentration. Using conversion coefficient generated by MERRA-2, column concentration was converted to surface concentration. 
 Black Carbon (BC) is a carbonaceous aerosol that strongly absorbs solar radiation. The high emissions of these highly absorbent particles exacerbate regional air quality and pose significant threats to global climate, both in the short and long term. Therefore, accurately quantifying the spatial distribution of BC is crucial for improving regional air quality and mitigating the climate change impacts driven by human activities. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm for retrieving BC surface concentration jointly using MODIS and AERONET data. Firstly, the algorithm employed the K-means clustering method to determine seasonal background aerosols model based on AERONET V3 daily products. Then, the Maxwell–Garnett effective medium approximation model was utilized to calculate the complex refractive index of the internally mixed aerosols. Subsequently, the lookup tables were established using the 6SV2.1 radiative transfer code to estimate optimal BC fraction and column concentration. Next, the column concentration data were converted to surface concentration using a conversion coefficient derived from MERRA-2. Finally, the retrieved MODIS BC surface concentration was validated with in-situ Aethalometer measurements. The validation showed a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.727, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.353, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.211, and a linear fit function of y=0.718x+0.015. These statistical parameters outperform those obtained from MERRA-2 BC data (R = 0.655, RMSE = 0.487, MAE = 0.381, and y=0.686x+0.400), demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in this study area."

Schwab,Aerial estimates of methane and  carbon dioxide emission rates using a  mass balance approach in New York State,"Methane and carbon dioxide emission rates were calculated for facilities across several sectors in New York State using aerial observations. Of the sampled facilities, landfills dominated the methane emission rates, while combustion facilities had the highest carbon dioxide emission rates, followed by landfills. The self-reported Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inventory mostly underestimates landfill methane emissions, apart from a few facilities with comparable numbers. 
 Accurate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories are vital for climate mitigation as they can identify areas of need and ensure effective policy and regulation in reducing GHG emissions. Several studies have shown that self-reporting GHG inventories are undercounting methane emissions across all anthropogenic sectors, showing an increasing need to validate the inventory with direct measurements. This study carried out aerial observations and emission rates of methane and carbon dioxide across multiple sectors in New York State (NYS). Emission rates were calculated for each of the sources using a mass balance method and were subsequently compared to the 2021 Environmental Protection Agency GHG Reporting Program (EPA GHGRP) Inventory. Landfills were the source of the highest observed methane emission estimates, ranging from 161 to 3440 kg h−1. There was also significant variation in observed emissions within facilities between seasons, indicating a significant influence from meteorology. Variation in estimated measured emissions between different landfills could be due to operational differences. Observed carbon dioxide emission estimates were dominated by combustion facilities, followed by landfills. Comparisons with the inventory show that methane emissions averaged over 10 observed landfills are underestimated by a factor of 2. However, of the 10 landfills, 5 had observed methane emission estimates significantly higher than the inventory value, 4 had an inventory value within the uncertainty range of the observations, and 1 had a landfill-observed emission estimate that was markedly lower than the reported inventory estimate. Seneca Meadows Landfill was the highest emitter from the measurements and was ∼ 4.3× higher than the annual average estimate that was reported to the 2021 EPA GHGRP Inventory. NYS can use this information to inform the NYS GHG Inventory and improve emission estimation methodologies to better depict actual emissions.

We show that clear sky false color imagery derived for monthly and yearly time periods can be effectively used to identify changes to the surface water coverage. In addition, we also use Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to derive more accurate boundaries of new water bodies with complex geometries. We demonstrate improved coverage from satellite ocean color and inland water property retrievals with the improved land mask, including a range of new inland water bodies, as well as changes to the extent of the existing water bodies.

K. Bowring;Daniel S. Goll;Ying-Ping Wang,Representing high-latitude deep carbon in the pre-industrial  state of the ORCHIDEE-MICT land surface model (r8704),"Including high-latitude deep carbon is critical for projecting future soil carbon emissions, yet it is absent in most land surface models. Here we propose a new carbon accumulation protocol by integrating deep carbon from Yedoma deposits and representing the observed history of peat carbon formation in ORCHIDEE-MICT. Our results show an additional 157 Pg C in present-day Yedoma deposits and a 1–5 m shallower peat depth and 43 % less passive soil carbon in peatlands compared to the conventional protocol. 
 Field measurements, after extrapolation, suggest that deep Yedoma deposits (ice-rich, organic-rich permafrost, formed during the late Pleistocene) and peatlands (formed mostly during the Holocene) account for about 600 Pg C of soil carbon storage. Incorporating this old, deep, cold carbon into land surface models (LSMs) is crucial for accurately quantifying soil carbon responses to future warming. However, it remains underrepresented or absent in current LSMs, which typically include a passive soil carbon pool (a conceptual soil carbon pool with the longest turnover time) to represent all “old carbon” and lack the vertical accumulation processes that deposited deep carbon in the layers of peatlands and Yedoma deposits. In this study, we propose a new, more realistic protocol for simulating deep and cold carbon accumulation in the northern high latitudes (30–90° N), using the ORCHIDEE-MICT (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms–aMeliorated Interactions between Carbon and Temperature) model. This is achieved by (1) integrating deep carbon from Yedoma deposits whose formation is calculated using Last Glacial Maximum climate conditions and (2) prescribing the inception time and location of northern peatlands during the Holocene using spatially explicit data on peat age. Our results show an additional 157 Pg C in present-day Yedoma deposits, as well as a shallower peat carbon depth (by 1–5 m) and a smaller passive soil carbon pool (by 35 Pg C, 43 %) in northern peatlands, compared to the old protocol that ignored Yedoma deposits and applied a uniform, long-duration (13 500 years) peat carbon accumulation across all peatlands. As a result, the total organic carbon stock across the Northern Hemisphere (30–90° N) simulated by the new protocol is 2028 Pg C, which is 226 Pg C higher than the previous estimate. Despite the significant challenge of simulating deep carbon with ORCHIDEE-MICT, the improvements in the representation of carbon accumulation from this study provide a model version to predict deep carbon evolution during the last glacial–deglacial transition and its response to future warming. The methodology implemented for deep carbon initialization in permafrost and cold regions in ORCHIDEE-MICT is also applicable to other LSMs."

Climate models therefore need an accurate description of their properties and evolution. Satellites measure how strongly aerosol particles extinguish light passing through the stratosphere. We describe a method to use such aerosol extinction data to retrieve the number and sizes of the aerosol particles and calculate their optical effects. The resulting data sets for models are validated against ground-based and balloon observations. 
 Stratospheric aerosol is an important climate forcing agent as it scatters some of the incoming solar radiation back to space, thus cooling the Earth's surface and the troposphere. At the same time, it absorbs some of the upwelling terrestrial radiation that heats the stratosphere. It also plays an important role in stratospheric ozone chemistry by hosting heterogeneous reactions. Major volcanic eruptions can cause strong perturbations of stratospheric aerosol, changing its radiative and chemical effects by more than an order of magnitude. Many global climate models require prescribed stratospheric aerosol as input to properly simulate both climate effects in the presence and absence of volcanic eruptions. This paper describes REMAP, a retrieval method and code for aerosol properties that has been used in several model intercomparison projects (under the name Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment-3λ, SAGE-3λ). The code fits a single-mode lognormal size distribution for a pure aqueous sulfuric acid aerosol to aerosol extinction coefficients from observational or model data sets. From the retrieved size distribution parameters, the code calculates the effective radius; surface area density; and extinction coefficients, single-scattering albedos, and asymmetry factors of the aerosol within the wavelength bands specified for each individual climate model. We validate REMAP using balloon-borne observations after the Mount Pinatubo and Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha`apai (HTHH) volcanic eruptions, as well as 4 decades of lidar measurements. Within the constraints of a single-mode lognormal distribution, REMAP generates realistic effective radii and surface area densities after volcanic eruptions and generally matches the lidar backscatter time series within measurement uncertainty. Deviations in aerosol backscatter by up to a factor of 2 arise when (non-volcanic) tropospheric intrusions (e.g., from wildfires) are present and the size distribution deviates significantly from the single-mode lognormal type. We describe the products that have been used in CCMI (Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative), CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 ), and other model intercomparison projects and provide practical instructions for use of the code in future applications."

To address this, we developed the Community Cloud Model Evaluation Toolkit (CoCoMET) that makes it easier to analyze clouds in both models and observations. By simplifying data processing, standardizing results, and introducing new analysis features, CoCoMET helps researchers better evaluate cloud behavior and improve models. 
 Advances in performance and analysis capabilities have accelerated the development of object tracking algorithms for atmospheric research. This has resulted in a growing number of studies using Lagrangian tracking techniques to analyze the evolution of atmospheric phenomena and the underlying processes. However, the increasing complexity and variety of tracking algorithms present a steep learning curve for new users and make it difficult for existing users to compare algorithm performance.We introduce CoCoMET (Community Cloud Model Evaluation Toolkit), an open-source toolkit that addresses these issues. CoCoMET simplifies the process of running multiple tracking algorithms simultaneously and analyzing objects in both model and observational datasets by specifying parameters in a single configuration file. It standardizes input data from different sources into a consistent format and unifies the tracking output across algorithms. CoCoMET enhances the functionality of existing tracking methods by calculating additional properties such as cell growth and dissipation rates, perimeter, surface area, convexity, and irregularity. In addition, CoCoMET includes a novel method for identifying mergers and splits in 2D and 3D tracks and supports the integration of Eulerian/stationary datasets external to the tracking data for process studies. Its potential utility is demonstrated through examples of model intercomparison, model evaluation against observations, and comparisons between tracking algorithms. Designed for open-source environments, CoCoMET will continue to expand with future releases, incorporating more input data types and tracking algorithms."

Rajah;Benjamin Blanz;Birgit Kopainsky;William Schoenberg,An endogenous modelling framework of dietary behavioural  change in the fully coupled human-climate FRIDA v2.1 model,"Climate models often exclude human behaviour. We introduce a model that includes economic, social, and environmental factors that influence dietary choices. This helps us understand how behaviour shifts impact future emissions and climate conditions. By considering a range of plausible behaviours, we provide a more accurate picture of potential outcomes, improving representations in climate models. 
 Integrated assessment models (IAMs) occupy a central role in understanding and assessing the intricate interlinkages within the human-climate system for informing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, there has been limited work on explicitly representing the internal social system dynamics that underlie human behavioural responses to climate change within IAMs. Instead, behavioural change and demand-side strategies are assessed with external, non-probabilistic narrative-based scenario analyses. In this paper, we introduce an alternative fully endogenous behavioural change modelling framework within the FRIDA v2.1 model, operationalized with the system dynamics method. Applied to the context of dietary behaviour, the framework models behavioural change as a function of perceived accessibility, descriptive norm, and personal norms, constrained by accessibility and past behaviour. By doing so, it captures the complex social-economic-cultural-environmental feedback processes within the human-climate system that dynamically determine per capita food demand and consumption. Our simulation results show that endogenizing human behaviour leads to lower future demand projections compared to the more prevalent GDP-driven modelling approach. This demonstrates the significant impact of behavioural feedbacks on emission behaviours and thus climate outcomes. Importantly, using an uncertainty approach, our results account for a range of plausible behaviours within the 95 % confidence bounds, which includes scenarios where we observe reversals of sustainable behavioural change in the future. We contribute to the limited work on human behaviour in IAMs, extending the complexity of current representations. Future work will extend this framework to other domains of high-impact behaviours, enhancing the robustness of IAMs for assessing demand-side mitigation."

We synthesized 262 metagenomes to infer global MP pollution and tested associations between MPs and viral functional gene abundance against 24 physicochemical–biological variables. From 2000 to 2020, >20% of the North and southeastern Atlantic showed significant increases (p < 0.05) in viral functional gene abundance, whereas 61% of the northwestern Atlantic decreased. These shifts covaried with MP accumulation, nutrient regimes, and climate indices. In a northwestern Atlantic hotspot, neglecting MPs may lead to a ∼15% underestimation of viral functional gene abundance. In low-chlorophyll (Chl) regions (57.6% of the ocean), genes linked to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling were >30% more abundant in high- versus low-MP regions; MPs did not strongly affect the abundance of viral functional genes. Network analyses revealed cascading interactions among viral functional gene abundance, MPs, Fe, Chl, and environmental properties. Our results suggest that ignoring MPs may lead to the underestimation of viral functional potential and related biogeochemical processes, and that low-Chl regions─proposed priority protection areas─are particularly vulnerable to MPs pollution."

The formation of ion pairs between PFAS and cationic surfactants was tested through controlled batch experiments with varying types and dose of HIP (e.g., cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC)) and surface tension measurements. Interactions between PFAS and CTAC were observed to be disturbed in high ionic strength solution, likely due to competitive electrostatic interactions from the presence of inorganic ions. Addition of CTAC (2 μM) prior to GAC treatment in batch adsorption experiments greatly improved the sorption of short-chain PFAS (<C7) by 54–111% but suppressed the sorption of long-chain PFAS (>C7) by 23–96%. The changes in sorption capacities were hypothesized to result from the altered physicochemical properties of the formed ion pair complex, thereby affecting its uptake on GAC. Both the linear free energy relationship (LFER) calculation and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation suggested that short-chain PFAS sorption was improved via enhanced hydrophobicity of formed ion pairs with a low self-assembly tendency, while long-chain PFAS sorption was inhibited due to the formation of large complexes with a high self-assembly tendency. Rapid small-scale column tests were performed for tap water spiked with an equal mass of perfluorobutanoate (PFBA), perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS), and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS).

We measured eight PFAS in maternal plasma collected 24–72 h postpartum using HPLC–MS/MS and mtDNAcn in cord blood using targeted sequencing. We used multivariable linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression models to estimate associations between PFAS and mtDNAcn Z-score, overall and stratified by newborn sex and maternal folate level. We observed that associations varied by PFAS species, including an inverse association with PFOS and nonlinear associations with Me-PFOSA-AcOH, PFDeA, and PFNA. Associations of PFHxS and PFOS with mtDNAcn differed by sex. Notably, we found inverse associations of Me-PFOSA-AcOH, PFOS, and the PFAS mixture only among newborns whose mothers had low folate levels.

However, whether and how PFOA and PFOS affect human placentation and placental-specific functions remains unclear. In this study, we reconstructed a human trophoblast organoid model, incorporating a near-physiological proportion of extravillous trophoblast (EVT). The organoids were exposed to PFOA or PFOS for 7 days. Exposure to PFOA at 10 nM significantly increased the proportion of villous cytotrophoblast (CTB) cells, while reducing the proportion of EVT and syncytiotrophoblast (STB) cells at 10 and 100 nM, respectively. A similar pattern was observed with PFOS, albeit at concentrations 10 times higher than those of PFOA. Mechanistically, both PFOA and PFOS inhibited trophoblast differentiation by antagonizing the transcriptional activity of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). This disruption in placentation impaired placental function, as evidenced by significantly decreasing hormone secretion and invasion potential. Our investigation may provide mechanistic insight into the association of PFOA and PFOS with low birth weight observed in epidemiological studies, with PFOA demonstrating a stronger effect than PFOS.

In this study, the influence of different HA concentrations on the structural evolution of nZVI,  synchronous •OH generation, and arsenite [As(III)] sequestration was investigated. While HA did not alter the types of evolutionary products, it accelerated zerovalent iron (Fe0) corrosion. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure and density functional theory calculation revealed that adsorbed-HA extended the Fe–O bonds in the nZVI surface, causing the compact passivation layer to rupture and the inner Fe0 to expose. This structural destabilization, along with reduced nZVI aggregation induced by HA, promoted the continuous corrosion of Fe0. Furthermore, quantitative analysis by high performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that HA enhanced •OH production in the nZVI system by up to 7-fold, due to the increased Fe(II)/Fe(II)–HA concentrations in solution. In addition, rapid Fe0 corrosion facilitated more •OH-mediated oxidation of As(III) to arsenate [As(V)] at pH 6.0, whereas at pH 9.0, it resulted in faster As(III) sequestration by generating new adsorption sites and enhancing As–Fe coprecipitation.

Recent studies have found that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and glutathione depletion, may play a critical role in the dissemination of ARGs among environmental microbes. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that phthalate esters (PAEs) and their substitutes significantly enhanced plasmid conjugation by triggering ferroptosis-related pathways. Classical ferroptosis-associated responses, including the hyperpolarization of the cell membrane potential, elevated production of reactive oxygen species, and heightened membrane permeability, were observed under the stress of PAEs or their substitutes. Through integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we revealed that these compounds triggered iron dysregulation via the upregulation of iron acquisition and storage pathways while suppressing DNA replication, concurrently causing oxidative damage that stimulated the plasmid conjugation. Molecular docking simulations revealed that PAEs and their substitutes competitively disrupted the functionality of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein, a master controller of intracellular iron homeostasis, with superior binding affinity than its natural ligand Fe2+. Integrated metagenomic sequencing and homology analyses demonstrated the conservation of Fur protein across biofilm microbiota and functional implications in iron homeostasis. Structural analysis based on the characteristic molecular fingerprints of chemicals pinpointed aliphatic chains as the crucial structure responsible for enhancing ARG propagation between bacteria.

Using bacteriophage MS2 as a model, this study explores the impact of progressive inoculant purification processing by centrifugation, filtration, and ultrafiltration, on photoinactivation rates. Faster inactivation kinetics under UVB radiation correlated with greater presence of background proteins as identified via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Differences in the determined rate constants were large and statistically significant, nearing a 70% increase from the lowest to highest protein presence. Variations remained even after 100× dilution of viral stock preparations. Furthermore, the likely basis was determined to be an indirect inactivation mechanism via sensitization of host or media proteins in the solution background, as evidenced by the inclusion of singlet oxygen scavenger l-histidine, which resulted in a clustering of reaction rates near the ultracentrifuged sample.

In decapod crustaceans, sex-specific habitat uses and seasonal migrations are well-documented, yet their role in EMF sensitivity remains untested. We exposed juvenile shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) (n = 120; 1:1 sex ratio) to EMFs of 500, 1000, and 3200 μT using a Helmholtz coil system and tracked behavior over 10 min trials.

They also drove differences in distance moved, whereas males showed no consistent spatial preference and indifferent activity at the highest field strength. These sex-specific responses suggest SPC EMFs could disrupt female-driven reproductive behaviors like seasonal migrations and larval release. Attraction may cause disorientation, aggregation, or delays in migration, potentially altering sex ratios and reducing larval export.

We find that kinetically limited condensation of a few species dominates particle composition and growth. Particle-phase processes, including oligomerization and organonitrate hydrolysis, do not influence the early growth. dVBS growth rate predictions can explain 90% of the measured growth, dominated by kinetic condensation of low-volatility species.

We used a nationwide data set among wearable smart device users to assess the association between TV and OSA severity in a population at moderate-to-severe risk of OSA. A case time series statistical method was used to assess the associations between TV and the risk of OSA exacerbation, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and mean oxygen saturation (SpO2). Additionally, we explored the interaction of TV and air pollution with OSA severity. A total of 52,752 participants with 6,349,414 days of monitoring were finally included in the study. A 1 °C increase in TV01 was associated with an increase of 0.92% (95%CI: 0.69, 1.15%) in excess risk of OSA exacerbation, increases of 0.046 events/h (95%CI: 0.036, 0.057) in AHI, and a decrease of 0.0064% (95%CI: 0.0059, 0.0068%) in SpO2.

By using discrete element method, we explore how the pinning points affect the level ice motion and develop a first‐order theory to evaluate their impact on ice dynamics. Results show that maximum level ice resistance occurs at the onset of ice motion, when total resistance equals the sum of all turbines, followed by a drop as wakes from upstream turbines reach the downstream ones during linear ice motion. The degree of this reduction depends on the number of turbines, the direction of ice motion, and the ratio between turbine waterline diameter and spacing.

While existing research has demonstrated the simultaneous link between the North Atlantic tripole (NAT) and precipitation anomalies in Eurasia, the underlying mechanisms connecting boreal winter NAT to subsequent summer precipitation anomalies remain unclear. This study reveals that the boreal winter NAT, persisting into summer, significantly affects Eurasian summer precipitation. It demonstrates that diabatic heating anomalies contribute ∼29% to the teleconnection wave train, while transient eddy vorticity forcing accounts for ∼25%. The wave train propagates downstream, causing circulation and precipitation anomalies over Eurasia.

This study demonstrates that the decadal transition in winter SWS across China is primarily attributed to the internal mode associated with the Warm Arctic−Cold Eurasia (WACE) pattern. Removing the WACE−related SWS change causes the internal component of the SWS trend to reduce by approximately 25.0%. Enhancing the simulation of the WACE pattern improves the decadal transition prediction of SWS. In the near future, the contribution of the WACE pattern to the SWS trend reaches about 21.4%, and the forcing scenario has a negligible influence on the results. The WACE−related uncertainty in the global climate model could be an important source of reducing the WACE's contribution.

We simulate the evolution of the water vapor plume from the January 2022 Hunga eruption. The simulation suggests a lag time of 1.4 years and the decay time 2.35 ± 0.05 years, producing a stratospheric lifetime of 3.75 ± 0.05 years. From Microwave Limb Sounder observations, we estimate the Hunga water vapor plume decay time to be 2.6 ± 0.75 years and the lifetime to be 4.0 ± 0.75 years which is in good agreement with our model calculations. Overall, we find that injected material lifetime increases with altitude and decreases with the latitude. If polar stratospheric cloud formation is a loss process, the lifetime is shortened. Aerosol gravitational settling also shortens the lifetime and should be included especially for aerosols with >0.5 μm radius. We use the observed lifetime of the Hunga aerosol plume and gravitational settling rate to estimate a particle median radius of ∼0.3 µm in agreement with other estimates.

Two sets of simulations (medium‐range and seasonal forecast) are carried out for the comparison and validation against observation. It is shown that through local/remote forcing of the drag in the mountainous regions, the 3D‐oro alleviates part of the excessive rainfall in west Tibetan Plateau and parts of insufficient rainfall in Southeast China by about 25%∼50% in the January/winter forecasts; it alleviates about 25%∼50% of the rainfall bias in part of south Tibetan Plateau and of East Asia in the July/summer forecasts.

In this study, we investigate the impact of AMOC weakening on South America's mean climate, as well as temperature and precipitation extremes. We analyze targeted sensitivity experiments using the EC‐Earth3 climate model. Our findings reveal that AMOC weakening induces cooling and wetting in the tropics of South America, contrasted by warming and dryness in the extratropics. This pattern weakens the meridional temperature gradient, shifts the intertropical convergence zone and the high‐latitude winter and summer jets southward, and reduces midlatitude storm tracks, particularly in austral winter. We analyze extreme events in two representative regions—La Plata Basin and northeast Brazil—which exhibit contrasting responses. In La Plata Basin, summer heat waves become more frequent, intense, and prolonged, while winter cold spells occur more frequently but with decreased intensity and duration when the AMOC reduces. In contrast, northeast Brazil experiences an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, while cold spells become less frequent but more intense. Extreme precipitation events weaken in the La Plata Basin but intensify in northeast Brazil in both seasons under AMOC weakening. Some of these climate impacts may exacerbate global warming effects, while others may partially offset them. These findings underscore the critical need to refine climate models' representation of AMOC dynamics to improve predictions of future climate scenarios."

AMVs from GOES‐16/17 products can augment wind data in data‐sparse oceanic areas such as those frequented by atmospheric rivers (ARs). However, AMVs exhibit biases and uncertainties, especially due to height assignment issues, and there are fewer conventional data (e.g., radiosondes) to assess GOES‐17 AMVs over oceans. The AR Reconnaissance (AR Recon) samples ARs to improve forecast skill over the U.S. West and provides a unique opportunity to compare GOES‐17 AMVs. This study quantifies biases and uncertainties in GOES‐17 AMVs in the northeast Pacific using dropsondes from AR Recon, and assesses Global Forecast System (GFS) model wind analyses and background fields during AR events. Results for four representative AR cases show that GOES‐R AMVs improved wind data distribution compared to cases prior to GOES‐R becoming operational, particularly in the upper and lower troposphere. A comparison with dropsondes reveals a small vector wind speed bias of −0.7 m s−1. The uncertainty for AMVs is estimated at 5–6 m s−1. Comparison of collocated GFS model background wind fields shows small biases. Data assimilation reduces root‐mean‐squared differences, but the small biases in operational AMVs need further attention as they are a predominant wind data source in the GFS over oceanic regions."

Total and water‐soluble trace metal concentrations in ECSs were higher than those in NWPO, suggesting anthropogenic and terrestrial emissions had greater impacts on TSPs in ECSs. Total and water‐soluble trace metal concentrations in dust TSPs were higher than those in normal TSPs in NWPO, indicating that dust plumes mixed with anthropogenic emissions can be transported to NWPO. Based on enrichment factors, correlation analysis, positive matrix factorization model, and characteristics of trace metals from different sources, four emission sources (crustal mineral, ship exhaust, fossil fuel combustion, and marine emissions) of trace metals in marine TSPs in NWPO were identified. Aerosol sources, aerosol pH values, aging processing, and dust loading significantly affect trace metal solubility in different types of TSPs. Dry deposition fluxes of trace metals in ECSs were higher than those in NWPO.

However, the water‐insoluble organic fractions among marine OA increased obviously during periods dominated by dust or marine emissions. Source apportionment and fluorescent components of OA were further analyzed to gain a quantitative insight into the seasonal variations of the marine OA sources. During autumn, the severe influence of continental anthropogenic pollutants led to a dominant presence of water‐soluble components in the marine OA. Anthropogenic secondary formation contributed 61% and 82% of the mass concentrations and the Abs300 of water‐soluble OA in autumn. Asian dust led to an obvious elevation of OA and brown carbon (BrC) light absorption over the YBS in spring, which contributed 70% and 66% of the water‐insoluble OA mass and Abs300, respectively. In spring, 59% of the OA fluorescence intensity was attributed to the dust‐related protein‐like organics.

However, climate change and global warming are altering the patterns in meteorological data, leading to gradual shifts in the statistical characteristics of climate variables. Existing statistical downscaling approaches primarily focus on fitting historical data while neglecting the integration of essential physical laws governing atmospheric dynamics. Although these models may perform well on past data, they risk losing accuracy when applied to future climate scenarios, particularly when faced with climate shifts or changing conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce a physics‐informed framework to downscale continuous temperature fields. Our framework is designed to decompose the temperature fields into a primary deterministic component and stochastic residual component, each modeled by distinct parts of the architecture. The deterministic component reconstructs the primary temperature field, whereas the stochastic diffusion component captures small‐scale details and uncertainties. Moreover, this framework integrates vertical dynamics by incorporating physical priors derived from the fundamental temperature variation equation, combined through zero convolution, and applied as physics priors in the downscaling process using a 3D U‐Net architecture as the encoder. The model's loss function includes Charbonnier loss for data fitting along with static stability loss, gradient loss, and coupling loss to ensure physical consistency and accurate vertical interaction representation. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional techniques, reducing the error between downscaled results and high‐resolution observations to 0.627 K compared to 1.394 K with bicubic interpolation."

Although ice sheet expansion and sea level fall often exert coupled influences on Hadley circulation changes, most existing studies have focused on ice sheet and overlooked the role of sea level fall. Here, using climate simulations based the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM1‐F), we show that sea level fall and associated closure/constriction of seaways play roles comparable to ice sheet expansion in modulating Hadley circulation changes during the initial stage of the LG period (∼70 ka). The sea level fall leads to an interhemispheric energy imbalance, which in turn causes the southward shift of the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The closure/constriction of seaways weakens (strengthens) the Hadley circulation in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere and shifts its poleward edges equatorward in both hemispheres through influencing the meridional temperature gradient.

Here, we use measurements at Escudero Station (62.2°S, 58.97°W) on King George Island, north of the Antarctic Peninsula, to characterize clouds and their effects on the surface incoming radiation between 2017 and 2023. These measurements are unique providing 7 years of simultaneous cloud and radiation measurements, including year‐round observations. Cloud measurements using a mini micropulse lidar showed that clouds are present 96% of the time with persistent low‐level supercooled liquid‐containing clouds: 86% of the lowest cloud bases are within the first 1 km. Liquid was present about 80% of the time, and most liquid was supercooled: cloud‐base temperatures were below 0°C for 82% of atmospheric columns classified as liquid‐containing. Combining pyranometer and pyrgeometer measurements with clear‐sky radiative transfer modeling, we find that the downward cloud radiative forcing is negative during October–March and positive during April–September. For clouds with base temperatures below 260 K, downward longwave cloud forcing is found to be lower for ice‐only clouds than for liquid‐containing clouds; however, at warmer temperatures, both ice‐only and liquid‐containing clouds exhibited similar radiative forcing. During strong atmospheric river (AR) events, when long corridors of moisture bring heat and precipitation, surface temperatures are found to be positively correlated with downward shortwave (DSW) cloud forcing in summer, indicating that weaker DSW cloud forcing is linked to higher summertime surface temperatures."

However, its expansion, especially in high‐precipitation and mountainous regions of developing countries, has sparked growing concerns about its role in exacerbating downstream flood risks. This study critically examines the complex relationship between hydropower development and flood risk through the analysis of 107 major hydropower dams in such regions of the world spanning a period of 40 years. While 41.1% of the studied dams were found to exhibit flood mitigating characteristics by buffering against extreme inflows, 26.2% of dams were likely to exacerbate flood risks, primarily due to a steady increase in precipitation rates and sedimentation‐induced capacity loss. Hydropower dams in regions with shorter downstream river lengths were found to be more flood‐inducing than flood‐protecting. While regions with flood‐protecting dams naturally trigger urbanization and economic growth due to perceived safety and stable energy availability, these benefits are accompanied by the cost of increased deforestation. The study identified hotspots in South America and South Asia, where hydropower dams are more likely to be clustered as flood inducing in nature. Overall, the study calls for a paradigm shift in hydropower planning and management, emphasizing the integration of adaptive flood risk mitigation into energy production strategies keeping in mind the anticipated changes in climate and land cover along with a robust sedimentation management strategy during the dam's service lifespan."

However, the response of soil P availability to salinization remains unclear, making it difficult to assess its role in shaping plant responses to salinization. Here, we conducted a meta‐analysis of 823 observations from 87 published articles to investigate the effects of salinization on soil P availability and plant productivity across global terrestrial ecosystems. Across these studies, salinization decreased soil total P by an average of 4.6%, available P by 11.2%, and phosphatase activity by 25.4%. The effect of salinization on soil P availability was primarily modulated by salinization magnitude and exposure duration, vegetation types, ecosystem types, and climate conditions. Specifically, the negative effects of salinization on soil P availability were exacerbated with increasing salinization magnitude and duration, and were stronger in ecosystems dominated by herbaceous vegetation and in regions with lower precipitation. Across global ecosystems, the negative effects of salinization on soil P availability were associated with the declines in plant productivity. Our meta‐analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how salinization impacts soil P availability across diverse vegetation and ecosystem types worldwide, and highlights that optimizing fertilization strategies and plant community composition are crucial for enhancing plant productivity and ecosystem functioning in salt‐affected areas."

 Delta-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), or GluDs, are members of the iGluR ligand-gated ion channel family, yet their function remains enigmatic1. Although GluDs are widely expressed in the brain, play key roles in synaptic organization, and harbor disease-linked mutations, whether they retain iGluR-like channel function is debated as currents have not been directly observed2,3. Here, we define GluDs as ligand-gated ion channels that are tightly regulated in cellular contexts by purifying human GluD2 (hGluD2) and directly characterizing its structure and function using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bilayer recordings. We show that hGluD2 is activated by D-serine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), with augmented activation at physiological temperatures. We reveal that hGluD2 contains an ion channel directly coupled to clamshell-like ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which are coordinated by the amino terminal domain (ATD) above the ion channel. Ligand binding triggers channel opening via an asymmetric mechanism, and a cerebellar ataxia point mutation in the LBD rearranges the receptor architecture and induces leak currents. Our findings demonstrate that GluDs possess the intrinsic biophysical properties of ligand-gated ion channels, reconciling prior conflicting observations to establish a framework for understanding their cellular regulation and for developing therapies targeting GluD2."

 Internal organs are encased by a supportive epithelial monolayer of mesodermal origin, termed mesothelium. The nature, evolution and function of mesothelial cells, and their genetic regulation impacting disease development are insufficiently understood. Here, we generate a comprehensive organ-wide single-cell transcriptomic compendium of mesothelium across healthy and diseased mouse and human organs, delineating the evolution of conserved activated states of mesothelial cells in response to disease. We uncover genetic drives behind each cell state and reveal a conserved metabolic gate into multipotent proteolytic, inflammatory and fibrotic cell differentiation, in mouse and human. Using lung injury models in mice, in combination with mesothelial cell-specific viral approaches, we show that direct metabolic reprogramming using Ifi27l2a and Crip1 on organ surfaces, blocks multipotent differentiation and protects mouse lungs from fibrotic disease. These findings place mesothelial cells as cellular exemplars and gateway to fibrotic disease, opening translational approaches to subvert fibrosis across a range of clinical indications.

 The multifunctional protein gephyrin clusters inhibitory receptors at the postsynaptic membrane in the CNS. Gephyrin has been proposed to form the inhibitory postsynaptic density by liquid-liquid phase separation, involving a complex interplay between receptor binding and oligomerization via its conserved G- and E-domains. Here we show by single particle cryo-EM analysis that dimerization promotes the formation of gephyrin filaments in which two E-domain dimers are linked by Z-shaped interfaces formed between two subdomains II (SDII) of adjacent dimers. Deletion of SDII, introduction of two epilepsy-causing pathogenic variants, or neutralization of an opposing charge in the interface abolish the formation of filaments, in vitro phase separation, and synaptic receptor clustering in hippocampal neurons.

 Introduced species significantly impact native biodiversity worldwide, with extensive research on harms but relatively less focus on benefits. Here, using the IUCN Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) and EICAT+ frameworks, we assess 2021 negative and positive impacts of introduced large mammalian herbivores globally. We show that negative impacts are more common, and of higher magnitude than positive impacts, i.e. affect populations, not only the performance of individuals. Native species on islands and at higher trophic level experience greater impacts. Reported impact magnitudes decline over time only for positive impacts. Most positive impacts are caused indirectly through changes in species interactions and ecosystem properties, often following negative impacts on native plants through herbivory and disturbance. We therefore advise caution regarding the intentional introduction of large mammalian herbivores for conservation purposes (rewilding, assisted colonization) without rigorous assessment of their impacts on native communities.

 Women have reported menstrual changes following SARS-CoV-2 infection and variation in long COVID symptoms across the menstrual cycle. We examined (i) whether COVID is linked to abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), (ii) if long COVID symptoms vary with the menstrual cycle, and (iii) potential underlying mechanisms. Here we show long COVID was associated with AUB in a UK population. When compared to those never infected (n = 9423), long COVID participants (n = 1048) reported increased menstrual volume, duration and intermenstrual bleeding, while those who recovered from acute COVID (n = 1,716) reported minimal menstrual disruption. Long COVID symptoms examined in 54 women across the menstrual cycle revealed that severity was highest during the perimenstrual and proliferative phases. Serum and endometrial analysis revealed higher serum 5α-dihydrotestosterone and lower endometrial androgen receptors in long COVID versus no COVID. Other ovarian hormones showed no significant differences. Serum cytokine profiling indicated increased menstrual inflammation with long COVID and immune cell aggregates were observed in menstrual endometrium. In conclusion, long COVID was associated with AUB but not impaired ovarian function. Differences in peripheral and endometrial inflammation may contribute to AUB and long COVID symptom severity.

 Childhood maltreatment effects on cerebral gray matter have been frequently discussed as a neurobiological pathway for depression. However, localizations are highly heterogeneous, and recent reports have questioned the replicability of mental health neuroimaging findings. Here, we investigate the replicability of gray matter correlates of maltreatment, measured retrospectively via the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, across three large adult cohorts (total N = 3225). Pooling cohorts yields maltreatment-related gray matter reductions, with most extensive effects when not controlling for depression diagnosis (maximum partial R2 = .022). However, none of these effects significantly replicate across cohorts. Non-replicability is consistent across a variety of maltreatment subtypes and operationalizations, as well as subgroup analyses with and without depression, and stratified by sex. Results are furthermore consistent across a variety of gray matter operationalizations, including voxel-based morphometry and parcellation-based cortical and subcortical measures. In this work, we show that there is little evidence for the replicability of gray matter correlates of childhood maltreatment, when adequately controlling for psychopathology. This underscores the need to focus on replicability research in mental health neuroimaging. Surprisingly consistent replication failure of gray matter correlates of childhood maltreatment raises questions about publication bias in prior literature and about prevailing models linking maltreatment to brain structure in adult populations."

Mester et al. show that measures of human development and rural areas are more important than GDP per capita in explaining the varying vulnerability to such displacement. 
 Floods displace an average of 12 million people every year, and are responsible for 54% of all disaster-induced displacements. Displacement risk scales with the vulnerability of exposed populations, but this vulnerability is poorly understood at a global scale. Here we show that measures of human development and rural areas explain more of the variance of displacement vulnerability than income levels measured by gross domestic product. We combine global flood and displacement data to estimate vulnerability, as the ratio of displacement to exposure, for over 300 historical flood events. We find that this vulnerability varies by several orders of magnitude both between and within countries. A random forest regression shows that infant mortality rate and population density are among the most important predictors of displacement vulnerability at national level and within countries, respectively, highlighting the vulnerability of low-income and marginalized populations and of rural communities. Our results indicate that, rather than relying on overall economic development alone, targeted investments are needed to improve living conditions and coping capacities for the most vulnerable groups, particularly outside of large cities, and to prepare for increasing flood hazards due to climate change.

Here, the authors show the clonal dynamics of this proliferation and how clonality contributes to microglial heterogeneity in a mouse stroke model, revealing distinct interclonal interactions. 
 Microglial proliferation is a principal element of the inflammatory response to brain ischemia. However, the precise proliferation dynamics, phenotype acquisition, and functional consequences of newly emerging microglia are not yet understood. Using multicolor fate mapping and computational methods, we here demonstrate that microglia exhibit polyclonal proliferation in the ischemic lesion of female mice. The peak number of clones occurs at 14 days, while the largest clones are observed at 4 weeks post-stroke. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of microglia reveal a homogeneous acute response to ischemia with a pattern of outward and inward currents that evolves over time. In the resolution phase, 8 weeks post-stroke, microglial cells within one clone share similar membrane properties, while neighboring microglia from different clones display more heterogeneous electrophysiological profiles. Super-resolution microscopy and live-cell imaging unmask various forms of cell-cell interactions between microglial cells from different clones. Overall, this study demonstrates the polyclonal proliferation of microglia after cerebral ischemia and suggests that clonality contributes to their functional heterogeneity. Thus, targeting clones with specific functional phenotypes may have potential for future therapeutic modulation of microglia after stroke. Microglia proliferate in response to ischemic stroke.

 Monitoring Sahelian rainfall variability is increasingly critical as climate extremes intensify across the region. Here, we develop the Sahelian Monsoon Ocean-Pressure Index (SMOPI), a novel global synthetic indicator constructed from five dynamically coherent sea-level pressure regions statistically linked to June-September Sahel monsoon rainfall. SMOPI captures intra-seasonal and interannual variability, and crucially, reflects the influence of both regional processes and large-scale teleconnections on monsoon dynamics. It aligns with the dominant rainfall variability mode in reanalyses and 29 CMIP6 models. Strong/positive SMOPI phases coincide with wet years and are associated with enhanced convergence, favorable jet configurations, and robust Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean teleconnections. Conversely, weak/negative SMOPI phases correspond to drought conditions and divergent moisture fluxes.

 The methane-cycling microbiomes play crucial roles in methane dynamics. However, little is known about their distributions on a pan-Arctic scale as well as their responses to the widespread permafrost degradation. Based on 621 datasets of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from intact permafrost soils across the pan-Arctic, we identified only 22 methanogen and 26 methanotroph phylotypes. Their relative abundances varied significantly between sites and soil horizons. Only four methanogen phylotypes were detected at all locations. Remarkably, the permafrost soil methane filter was almost exclusively dominated by some obligate methanotroph (Methylobacter-like) phylotypes. However, a case study in Alaska suggests that atmospheric methane oxidizing bacteria (Methylocapsa-like phylotypes) dominated methanotrophs in a drier condition after permafrost degradation. These findings point towards a few key microbes particularly relevant for future studies on Arctic methane dynamics in a warming climate and that under future dry conditions, increased atmospheric methane uptake in Arctic upland soils may occur.

 Hyperspectral images (HSIs) can capture detailed spectral features for object recognition, while multispectral images (MSIs) can provide a high spatial resolution for accurate object location. Deep learning methods have been widely applied in the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images, but still face challenges, including the limited capacity to enhance spatial details and preserve spectral information, as well as issues related to spatial scale dependency. In this paper, to solve the above problems and achieve more effective information integration between HSIs and MSIs, we propose a novel multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion transformer (MHFu-former). The proposed MHFu-former consists of two main components: (1) a feature extraction and fusion module, which first extracts deep multi-scale features from the hyperspectral and multispectral imagery and fuses them to form a joint feature map, which is then processed by a dual-branch structure consisting of a Swin transformer module and convolutional module to capture the global context and fine-grained spatial features, respectively; and (2) a spatial-spectral fusion attention mechanism, which adaptively enhances the important spectral information and fuses it with the spatial detail information, significantly boosting the model’s sensitivity to the key spectral features while preserving rich spatial details. We conducted comparative experiments on the indoor Cave dataset and the Shanghai and Ganzhou datasets from the ZY1-02D satellite to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method significantly enhances the fusion performance across multiple key metrics, demonstrating its outstanding ability to process spatial and spectral details."

Mikelonis;Jonathan Sawyer,Evaluating Parsivel<sup>2</sup>'s raindrop data: A comparative study of different terminal drop velocity models on simulated and natural rain events,"•Determined drop velocity filters applied to simulated rain cause underestimation of rain rate. •Found different drop velocity filters reduced the total drop count to similar degrees. •Identified filters had more impact on the calculation ofDmcompared to log10Nw. •Recognized filters had a larger influence on convective rain compared to stratiform rain. 
 Rainfall measurement inherently contains uncertainty in the accuracy of the collected data. Theoretical terminal velocity models are used to filter drop size distributions (DSDs) collected by measurement devices to remove physically unlikely data. This filtration process decreases the number of drops and further influences the calculation of bulk rain parameters. This study compared the impact of different drop velocity models on the DSD and rain parameter calculations for both natural and artificial rain. A total of ten natural rainfall events were observed with a Parsivel2 disdrometer on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Research Triangle Park (RTP) campus in Durham, North Carolina, during June–July 2024. In addition, 732 min of artificial rainfall were generated using four nozzles at the U.S. EPA Fluid Modeling Facility (FMF) in Durham, North Carolina. The results showed that for artificial rainfall, the rain rate calculated from the instruments' ‘raw’ DSD data (terminal output %93) was on average 38.73 % higher across four nozzles compared to the Parsivel2's rain rate calculation. The rain rate calculated directly from ‘raw’ data more closely matched the volume of water collected in a bin than the Parsivel2's rain rate calculation. For natural rainfall, the research found that the investigated terminal velocity models performed similarly. The average reduction in drop count across the six drop velocity models tested was 0.14 %, with the highest reduction observed in the Atlas (1977) model at 0.36 %. For the accumulated DSD of ten rainfall events, the ranking of models by the number of filtered drops, from highest to lowest, was: Atlas (1977) > Uplinger (1981) > Atlas et al. (1973) > Beard (1976) > Van Dijk et al. (2002) > Gunn and Kinzer (1949). In contrast to artificial rain, both rain intensity and kinetic energy measured by Parsivel2 were higher than those calculated from the ‘raw’ DSD, and applying a filter reduced these values. The study also identified the microphysical characteristics of the natural precipitation, with peak values of liquid water content (W) and radar reflectivity factor (Z) observed at 0.6–0.7 g m−3 and 30 dBz, respectively. The average mass-weighted diameter Dm (normalized intercept parameter log10Nw) values for convective, mixed, and stratiform rain were 1.81 mm (5.40), 1.15 mm (4.18), and 1.35 mm (4.53), respectively. Filters had a more pronounced effect on the Dm values compared to the log10Nw values and appeared to have a larger influence on convective rain compared to stratiform rain. The study illustrated how various theoretical terminal drop velocity models used to filter the number of raindrops in a DSD affect the calculation of bulk rain parameters and how they are applicable to natural rainfall but not artificially produced rainfall. This research is valuable for gaining a deeper understanding of precipitation microphysics and improving the accuracy of rainfall assessments."

 Uncontrolled waste burning and accidental waste fires are an important source of emissions into the air. However, there are currently only few field studies providing data on these emissions. In this study, we investigated the emission rates, pollutant dispersion and particle composition for a large waste fire in Stockholm county, Sweden. Our results show that the waste fire, while burning, may have contributed as much as 5 times the mean PM10 emissions from road traffic of the municipality it was located in (ca 95 000 inhabitants), which highlights the potential impact of temporary events such as waste fires on air quality. Gaussian dispersion calculations were used to model the spatial distribution of measured PM10 data, demonstrating its use for assessment of exposure and deposition. Particles impacted by the waste fire were enriched in several potentially toxic metals and metalloids including arsenic, copper, cadmium and, in particular, lead when compared to particles collected after the fire. In addition, they may also pose an increased cancer risk on a per-mass basis compared to the post-fire period due to the larger mass fraction of relevant PAHs."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a large class of pollutants widely present in the environment and are the earliest discovered and studied carcinogens.The oxidation of PAHs can generate oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs), which are key precursors for the formation of SOA. However, the formation mechanism of OPAHs and NPAHs are unclear. Fluorene (FLN) is one of the most abundant PAHs discovered, and several studies have been conducted on the reaction of FLN. In this article, we investigated the oxidation mechanism of FLN initiated by OH radicals through high level quantum chemistry and chemical kinetics calculations. The oxidation starts by forming adducts FLN-n-OH (FLNn in short, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11) which then react with O2 and NO2 in the atmosphere. When the overall reaction rate coefficient of FLNn with O2 are slow, FLNn mainly react with NO2 to form n-nitrofluorene in the atmosphere. Effective reaction rates of FLN1 with O2 in the atmosphere are fast at of ∼1.90 × 104 s−1, suggesting the negligible reaction between FLN1 adduct and NO2. Therefore, the main fate of FLN1 is reaction with O2 followed by subsequent unimolecular isomerization routes, forming OPAHs only. The rate coefficient for reaction of FLN2, FLN4 and FLN10 with O2 are obtained at of 7.44, 26.4 and 1.07 s−1, respectively, suggesting the likely formation of 2-nitrofluorene 4-nitrofluorene and 10-nitrofluorene. In addition, the hydrogen atom abstraction from FLN and the generation of alkoxy groups from FLNn-i-OO resulted in formation of unsaturated compounds, which subsequently reacted with O2 to form a large number of unsaturated oxygen-containing compounds and further transform to highly oxidized products."

 In this study, we investigated the hygroscopic properties of aerosols containing organics related to biomass burning and atmospheric oxidation mixed with (NH4)2SO4 in various proportions during the hydration process using HTDMA. We extrapolated the morphology, phase transition, and potential chemical reactions based on the hygroscopic process of dried particles precipitated from the solution and findings from the literature. The levoglucosan-(NH4)2SO4 mixed particles exhibited deliquescence might be due to an incompletely encapsulated microstructure by levoglucosan, while a continuous growth process with gradual levoglucosan content increase could be attributed to the formation of a core-shell structure. Newly generated substances filled the micropores of succinic acid aerosol after the addition of (NH4)2SO4, but (NH4)2SO4 and succinic acid existed separately after droplet drying when (NH4)2SO4 was dominant. Experimental results of three-component aerosols with adjustable mass ratios reveal that hygroscopic properties and deliquescent relative humidity (DRH) significantly increased with (NH4)2SO4 content. In contrast, the increase in succinic acid reduced particle hygroscopicity at lower RH while having minimal effect on DRH. Furthermore, deliquescence was suppressed by forming a core-shell structure with levoglucosan increase, leading to continuous aerosol diameter increase. Overall, this study provides insights into the effects of (NH4)2SO4 on modulating the hygroscopic properties of typical organic surrogates related to biomass burning and atmospheric oxidation."

 Accurate characterization of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is crucial for atmospheric science, serving as a cornerstone metric in aerosol-climate process research and radiative forcing quantification. However, satellite-based AOD observations contain data gaps due to cloud contamination and high surface albedo. Appropriate statistical modeling of the spatio-temporal AOD process is therefore essential to filling those data gaps, so as to acquire a reliable and gap-free dataset. Owing to the high-dimensional nature of the underlying interpolation problem, traditional geostatistical approaches are computationally infeasible. In this study, a spatial mixed effect model is used to describe the AOD process, which separates the process into large-, small-, and fine-scale spatial variations, modeled through covariates and spatial basis functions. Since the dimension of the basis functions is fixed and is much smaller than the original data dimension, the method is known as fixed rank kriging (FRK), which makes the spatial prediction tractable. The empirical part of this study applies FRK on monthly and daily AOD observations from MODIS. On the monthly dataset, using the AERONET observations as the ground truth, FRK AOD is found to outperform several benchmarks, including inverse distance weighting interpolation, DeepKriging, and the MERRA-2 reanalysis. Additionally, on the daily dataset, FRK is shown to be able to effectively handle large-scale data, whereas other alternatives often fail due to computational infeasibility."
