10.1088/1748-9326/adf863,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了COVID-19疫情封锁期间排放减少对印度次大陆雷暴发生频率和闪电密度的影响。研究发现，人为气溶胶排放的显著减少导致气溶胶光学厚度降低，改变了区域云-气溶胶相互作用和辐射效应。气溶胶减少与闪电频率和雷暴天数的增加有关，表明在相对清洁的大气条件下，对流天气更有利。然而，疫情期间每次雷暴的闪电频率降低，表明虽然形成的雷暴更多，但每次雷暴的带电量较低。这项研究揭示了气溶胶浓度变化与对流风暴响应之间的复杂关系，并对未来排放情景下的大气带电趋势具有重要意义。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及气溶胶光学厚度等大气成分的监测，并利用这些数据来理解和预测天气模式的变化。虽然论文没有明确提及具体的卫星或传感器，但其研究结果依赖于对大气成分的观测，这通常需要遥感技术的支持。,"['aerosol optical depth', 'lightning flash rate density', 'thunderstorm days', 'aerosol-radiation-cloud interactions', 'anthropogenic aerosol emissions', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition', 'satellite observations (inferred)', 'remote sensing (inferred)']",Rakesh Ghosh;Pavan R Vaidya;Manoj A Domkawale;Sunil D Pawar;V Gopalakrishnan,Change in convection and thunderstorm occurrences over the Indian subcontinent during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The unprecedented emission reductions during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 provided a natural experiment to elucidate aerosol–radiation-cloud interactions and their effect on convective weather phenomena, particularly thunderstorm occurrence and lightning flash rate density (FRD), across the Indian subcontinent. The significant reduction in anthropogenic aerosol emissions, especially across the most polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain, led to a marked decrease in aerosol optical depth (AOD), altering regional cloud-aerosol interactions and radiative effects. A rise in ENSO-compensated lightning FRD and an increase in thunderstorm days (TDs) were associated with aerosol depletion, suggesting a favorable environment for convective initiation under relatively cleaner atmospheric conditions over the extremely polluted region. The reduced AOD likely led to enhanced surface heating and decreased upper-level warming, reversing the previously stable stratification caused by very high aerosol loading. This natural instability favored the formation of a greater number of widespread thunderstorms. However, the observed reduction in lightning FRD per TD during the pandemic year indicates that, while more storms formed, each storm exhibited lower electrification, likely due to diminished cloud condensation nuclei. Relatively lower aerosol concentrations can promote an increase in storm frequency through radiative destabilization of the atmosphere. However, these relatively cleaner conditions also tend to reduce lightning frequency within individual storms, as the limited presence of aerosols constrains non-inductive charging processes in clouds. Thus, environments with fewer aerosols are associated with more frequent storm development but a decrease in lightning flashes per storm, reflecting a complex interplay between atmospheric composition and convective electrification. These insights advance understanding of convective storm responses to aerosol variability and have important implications for future atmospheric electrification trends under changing emission scenarios. This dual effect highlights the complexity of aerosol–cloud-precipitation-electrification interactions. It has implications for understanding convective weather responses to air quality changes and future climate scenarios driven by aerosol management strategies."

We find that for stratospheric ozone recovery, the standard measure of climate effects underestimates a more comprehensive measure. 
 This study assesses three different measures of radiative forcing (instantaneous: IRF; stratospheric-temperature adjusted: SARF; effective: ERF) for future changes in ozone. These use a combination of online and offline methods. We separate the effects of changes in ozone precursors and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and configure model experiments such that only ozone changes (including consequent changes in humidity, clouds and surface albedo) affect the evolution of the model physics and dynamics.In the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0 (SSP3-7.0) we find robust increases in ozone due to future increases in ozone precursors and decreases in ODSs, leading to a radiative forcing increase from 2015 to 2050 of 0.268 ± 0.084 W m−2 ERF, 0.244 ± 0.057 W m−2 SARF and 0.288 ± 0.101 W m−2 IRF. This increase makes ozone the second largest contributor to future warming by 2050 in this scenario, approximately half of which is due to stratospheric ozone recovery and half due to tropospheric ozone precursors.Increases in ozone are found to decrease the cloud fraction, causing an overall negative adjustment to the radiative forcing (positive in the short wave but negative in the long wave). Non-cloud adjustments due to water vapour and albedo changes are positive. ERF is slightly larger than the offline SARF for the total ozone change but approximately double the SARF for the ODS-driven change (0.156 ± 0.071 W m−2 ERF, 0.076 ± 0.025 W m−2 SARF). Hence ERF is a more appropriate metric for diagnosing the climate effects of stratospheric ozone changes."

Bioaerosols are the major source of INPs at high temperatures, while mineral dust influences the global INP population at lower temperatures. These particles can satisfactorily reproduce INPs in a climate model. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions, particularly ice processes in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs), remain a key source of uncertainty in climate change assessments. This study introduces state-of-the-art laboratory-based parameterizations into a global chemistry–transport model to investigate the contributions of mineral dust (specifically K-feldspar and quartz), marine primary organic aerosol (MPOA), and terrestrial primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) to ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in MPCs. The model suggests that INPs originating from PBAPs (INPPBAP) are the primary source of INPs at low altitudes between −10 and −20 °C, particularly in the tropics, with a pronounced peak in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the boreal summer. INPPBAP contributes over 40 % of the total simulated INP column burden at midlatitudes. Dust-derived INPs (INPD) are prominent at high altitudes across all seasons, dominating at temperatures below −20 °C, and they constitute over 89 % of the INP average column burden at high latitudes in the NH and about 74 % at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). MPOA-derived INPs (INPMPOA) prevail in the SH at low altitudes, particularly at subpolar and polar latitudes for temperatures above −20 °C, where they represent between 17 % and 36 % of the INP column population, depending on the season. When evaluated against available global observational INP data, the model achieves its highest predictability across all temperature ranges when both INPD and INPMPOA are included as independent INP sources. The addition of INPPBAP does not enhance the model's ability to reproduce the available observations; however, INPPBAP remains a key contributor to warm-temperature ice-nucleation events. Therefore, consideration of dust, marine aerosol, and terrestrial bioaerosols as distinct INP species is required to simulate ice nucleation in climate models."

Buehler,A conceptual framework for understanding longwave cloud effects on climate sensitivity,"Using a single-column model, we investigate the effect of the vertical distribution of clouds on climate sensitivity. We show that, depending on their height, clouds can mask or unmask the radiative response of the clear-sky atmosphere. Our single-column model yields an all-sky climate sensitivity of 2.2 K, slightly less than the clear-sky value. This value can be interpreted as a baseline to which changes in surface albedo and an assumed reduction in cloud albedo would add. 
 We add idealized clouds into a single-column model and show that  cloud radiative effects, as observed from satellites, can be reproduced by a combination of high- and either low- or mid-level clouds.  To quantify all-sky climate sensitivity, we adopt the “fixed-cloud-albedo” ansatz as the null hypothesis for  climate sensitivity.  Our ansatz assumes an understanding of how clouds distribute themselves in temperature space, but it assumes no change in cloud albedo.  Drawing only distributions which match the cloud radiative effects of present-day observations yields a mean fixed-albedo climate sensitivity of 2.2 K  (also keeping surface albedo fixed), slightly smaller than its clear-sky value.  This small number arises from two compensating effects: the dominance of cloud masking of the radiative response, primarily by mid-level clouds, which are assumed not to change with temperature, and a reduction in the radiative forcing due to the masking effect by high clouds.  Giving more prominence to low-level clouds, which are assumed to change their temperature with warming, reduces estimates of the fixed-albedo climate sensitivity to 2.0 K. This provides a baseline to which changes in surface albedo and a presumed reduction in cloud albedo would add to."

Comprising 384 plots across Siberia, Canada, and Alaska, it features 16,530 manually segmented trees of 12 species. BorFIT supports AI applications for analyzing species distribution, stand structure, and boreal forest response to climate change. 
 BorFIT is a novel training data set designed to assist in the segmentation of individual trees and the detection of species from LiDAR point clouds, thus contributing to deep learning-based forestry applications. Recent advancements in AI-supported individual tree detection have shown significant progress; however, satisfactory results remain elusive in dense and structurally-complex boreal forests. We compiled a training data set designed to remedy this issue. It comprises 384 LiDAR point clouds, each with an area of 20 m × 20 m, in the form of reference plots, with up to 200 manually segmented and species classified trees per point cloud. We carried out LiDAR surveys at 146 sites between 2021 and 2024 in East Siberia (Yakutia), northwest Canada, and Alaska (USA), selected along a bioclimatic gradient to represent the circumboreal region. From each LiDAR transect derived point cloud, we extracted a minimum of four reference plots (each 20 m × 20 m) based on maximum tree heights within the plots to systematically sample the apparent tree density gradient. We manually segmented identifiable trees within each reference plot point cloud leading to 16,530 individual trees in total. Following segmentation, we trained four randomForest classifiers to predict the species of every segmented tree. The predicted tree species include: Picea mariana (Britton, Sterns Poggenb.), Picea sitchensis ((Bong.) Carrière), Picea glauca ((Moench) Voss), Pinus contorta (Douglas ex Loudon), Abies lasiocarpa ((Hook.) Nutt.), Larix laricina ((Du Roi) K.Koch), Betula papyrifera (Marshall), Betula neoalaskana ((Regel) Ashburner McAll.), Populus balsamifera (L.), Populus tremuloides (Michx.), Pinus sylvestris (Thunb.) and Alnus glutinosa ((L.). The data offer the means for 3D space analysis of species distribution and stand structure around the circumboreal region. Furthermore, it can be used as a training data set for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and thereby improve our understanding of the boreal forest’s vegetation reorganization in response to significant global warming."

The data merging yields total column-averaged and upper tropospheric/stratospheric partial column-averaged mole fractions (already provided by the individual data sets). In addition, it outputs tropospheric partial column-averaged mole fractions (not provided by any of the two individual data sets). We briefly document their increased potential for quantifying near-surface methane emissions. 
 Data products of atmospheric methane (CH4) with improved vertical sensitivity in the lower troposphere are crucial for gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of anthropogenic emissions. This study presents a CH4 data product derived from the synergetic combination of level 2 (L2) data from TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) and IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer), specifically CH4 total column and CH4 profiles, respectively. IASI enables high-quality observation of CH4 mixing ratios in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, and TROPOMI observations excel in providing sensitivity to the total column-averaged mixing ratio of CH4. By combining the IASI and TROPOMI L2 products synergetically, we can detect tropospheric CH4 (mixing ratios averaged over a layer from the surface up to 450 hPa) that is not significantly affected by the strong CH4 variations around the tropopause. This is not achievable by using IASI or TROPOMI data alone."

Validation confirms high accuracy. This breakthrough empowers researchers and to reliably analyze clouds' roles in climate change, weather patterns, and extreme events. 
 The use of remote sensing to accurately measure cloud properties and their spatial and temporal variability has become an important area of atmospheric science research. However, the heterogeneity of data formats across national agencies and the calibrate and navigate associated with the use of data from different agencies have prevented the climate research community from using the full continuum of global cloud physical properties products. In this paper, All-day Global Cloud Physical Properties (AGCPP) is proposed, which provides cloud physical properties covering nearly the entire globe, from latitude -70° to 70° and longitude -180° to 180°. The main attributes of this dataset include cloud phase, cloud top height, cloud optical thickness, and cloud effective radius, with a time range from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2022. AGCPP combines the observational advantages of geostationary satellites and polar-orbiting satellites. It uses the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-2 cloud product (MOD06/MYD06) to train the cloud-based attention-UNet (CloudAtUNet) model, and then evaluates AGCPP using MOD06/MYD06 and the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) 1 km cloud layer product. The evaluation results indicate that AGCPP demonstrates excellent continuity and consistency in both temporal and spatial accuracy, as well as high consistency in diurnal accuracy. Due to the long time series and all-day global nature of the dataset, it is expected that the dataset AGCPP will significantly increase the potential for climate change research, particularly with respect to potential feedback effects between clouds, surface albedo, and radiation.

By integrating multi-source remote sensing with National Forest Inventory, the dataset reveals dynamics consistent with China’s large-scale afforestation and reforestation initiatives. It is a vital tool for clarifying the effects of forest cover change on the regional terrestrial carbon balance. 
 High–spatial–resolution and long-term data on forest cover and plant functional types (PFTs) are crucial for elucidating the impacts of forest cover change on the national terrestrial carbon balance. Since the 1980s, China has undergone a substantial expansion in its forest area, primarily driven by large-scale national afforestation programmes. However, existing land cover products have often failed to capture this long-term increasing trend, leading to an underestimation of forest cover change–related ecological processes. Here, we developed a high-resolution (1 km), annual forest cover dataset for China during 1980–2023. This dataset integrates spatial constraints from multi-source remote sensing data with provincial-level statistics from China’s national forest inventories (NFIs), providing a consistent and spatially explicit record of forest dynamics over four decades. Building on this primary dataset, we further produced an annual PFT dataset that disaggregates total forest cover into eight distinct functional types, tailored for use in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Validation against independent data confirms the dataset’s ability to accurately represent historical forest recovery, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.3 ± 0.5 %, with classification accuracies for needleleaf and broadleaf forests ranging from 84.4 % to 92.0 %. To evaluate its applicability, we implemented the dataset within the Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ–GUESS). Compared to the widely used PFT dataset from the European Space Agency’s Land Cover Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), our product yields a markedly improved simulation of key biophysical and biogeochemical processes in China, enhancing the accuracy of evapotranspiration, leaf area index (LAI), and vegetation carbon flux by 49.4 %–77 %. With its high spatial resolution, long–term temporal coverage, and detailed forest-type classification, our dataset offers a robust foundation for assessing the ecological impacts of forest restoration and for constraining estimates of China’s forest carbon sink since 1980.

Meanwhile, the expert survey reveals concerns about implementation that exist for almost all policies (i.e., implementation gaps).

Using Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis), we tested whether adult progenitor exposure to crude oil caused perturbations to larval morphology and embryonic genome-wide gene expression in their first- and second-generation descendants raised in clean water. We also tracked responses of additional direct oil exposure in F1 and F2 embryos. Exposure to oil in progenitor fish caused an altered larval morphology, especially in F2 descendants. Some perturbations observed in descendent fish were enhanced by additional direct oil exposure in lineages with progenitors that had been exposed to oil. Progenitor exposures altered embryonic gene expression in F1 and F2 descendants, implicating impacts on neurological and cardiovascular systems. Molecular responses to progenitor exposure were distinct between F1 and F2 offspring, suggesting complex interactions between mechanisms that contribute to the transgenerational transfer of information. In contrast, molecular responses to additional direct oil exposure during early life development were highly conserved between generations and between progenitor exposure treatments.

Effect-directed analysis (EDA) uses bioassays to detect bioactive compounds and relies on sensitive small volume assays. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of three unicellular species (Raphidocelis subcapitata, Escherichia coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and five vertebrate cell lines to 21 chemicals with diverse modes of action. The algae assay exhibited the highest sensitivity, detecting toxicity in >80% of the chemicals, while yeast was the least responsive. Subsequently, 279 wastewater samples were screened using algae and three cell lines. Algae detected toxicity in >92% of the samples, while the cell line viability assays responded to 21–53% of the samples. Bioavailability modeling revealed that medium composition significantly influenced chemical partitioning. Algae assays that performed in protein- and lipid-free medium were more sensitive to lipophilic compounds than assays using heterotrophic cells. We hypothesize that medium-driven differences in bioavailability contribute to the higher sensitivity of algae, even to pharmaceuticals with no known algal targets. Combining algae and DR-EcoScreen cell assays captured 96.4% of detected toxicities in environmental samples. This combination offers a high-throughput, cost-effective strategy for screening environmental samples for bioactive substances."

Thus, a mechanistic understanding of these poisoning effects individually and in combination is crucial for addressing these problems. Herein, we report calcium (Ca)- and phosphorus (P)-induced local microenvironment modulation of the redox and acidic sites on a V2O5–WO3/TiO2 catalyst for NOx reduction. Phosphorus and calcium poison the catalyst and tune the local microenvironments of redox V–O and acidic W–O sites in different ways. Phosphorus poisons the catalyst primarily via impairing the functions of the V–O sites (e.g., redox property and polymerization state) by binding P to the VOx species, forming surface phosphate and crystalline VOx. Calcium, on the other hand, decreases the activity mainly through direct bonding with the acidic W–O sites, which significantly alters the initial W6+–O–V4+ local electronic structure and dramatically decreases its ability to adsorb and activate NH3 due to the diminished active VOx species and weakened redox functionality. In the presence of both Ca and P, the crystalline vanadia species are depolymerized, and the Ca-bonded tungsten species are released, restoring the initial local microenvironment of the acidic WO3 and redox V2O5 sites for SCR catalysis. These findings are supported by our DFT calculations, where Ca–P copoisoning results in a more favorable thermodynamics due to calcium phosphate formation. This work provides new insights about the deactivation mechanism of vanadia-based SCR catalysts in exhausts containing multiple poison components, and these insights would benefit the design of more durable NOx reduction catalysts for biodiesel applications."

However, understanding the molecular details of this phenomenon and leveraging and controlling it to increase the selectivity between ions in state-of-the-art membranes remain elusive. In this Perspective, we discuss the foundations of ion dehydration and explore opportunities to study and leverage this phenomenon for improving ion–ion selectivity in membranes. We first introduce the fundamentals and measurements of ion’s hydration properties in solution, distinguishing between static and dynamic hydration properties. Next, we discuss simulation and experimental techniques to study ion dehydration under confinement, highlighting critical knowledge gaps that impede our understanding of this phenomenon.

Global screening efforts have predominantly relied on competitive binding assays. Here, using biochemical assays and computational simulations, we identified a crucial but largely overlooked noncompetitive binding mode between EDCs and the androgen receptor (AR). Two underappreciated sites within the AR ligand-binding domain, active function 2 (AF2) and binding function 3 (BF3), were found to influence AR activity and coregulator recruitment. Specifically, AF2-binders sterically obstruct coactivator docking, while BF3-binders indirectly weaken coactivator interactions via allosteric coupling. We show that these newly recognized surfaces hamper AR-driven transcription even in the presence of endogenous hormones. Expanding the regulatory landscape of AR beyond its conventional ligand-binding domain, we find that noncompetitive binding was prevalent among 7841 EDCs. Notably, the AF2 site emerged as a key hotspot, with median preference scores exceeding those of other sites by more than 3-fold among active EDCs. These findings challenge the current paradigm of EDC screening, underscore the need for broadened assay development, and pave the way for innovative methods tailored to noncompetitive mechanisms."

This study examined microplastic ingestion in wild oysters of varying sizes (spat to adult) over three months in the Maowei Sea, a mariculture bay in China. Results revealed a positive correlation between oyster size and microplastic ingestion per individual, with larger oysters accumulating more microplastics, primarily in the visceral mass and mantle compared with the gills. However, when normalized by tissue mass, smaller oysters exhibited markedly higher burdens. Specifically, microplastic counts increased by ∼0.53 particles per individual per 1 cm increase in shell length, while the concentration decreased by ∼0.48 particles per gram of tissue per 1 cm increase. This inverse relationship highlights that size is a critical factor influencing the microplastic exposure risk per unit biomass. Additionally, a negative correlation between catalase (CAT) enzyme activity and microplastic exposure over two months provided field-based evidence of oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of a size-dependent pattern in microplastic accumulation among wild oysters from spat to adult; notably, this effect manifests only across broad developmental stages rather than within shorter time scales."

To investigate this, we collected gravel from the surface of unpaved roads in and around Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Chemical extractions of road dust allowed for the detection and quantification of 6PPD-Q within each sample. Concentrations of 6PPD-Q ranged between 0.207 and 1.47 ng/g of dw (median: 0.511 ng/g of dw). When normalized to TOC content, concentrations varied between 9.83 and 342 ng/g of TOC (median: 145 ng/g of TOC).

Using data from the Hong Kong air quality monitoring network of 15 stations, we identified 37 city-scale haze episodes between November 2020 and May 2021, defined by PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 25 μg m–3. Hourly to bihourly measurements of PM2.5 chemical compositions─including molecular and elemental tracers─at a supersite enabled PM2.5 source identification and apportionment. Strong correlations in PM2.5 and trace element concentrations between the general stations and the supersite indicate spatial homogeneity of air pollution across Hong Kong during these episodes. Variations in the air mass origin and source intensity were found to significantly influence city-scale PM2.5 levels. Source apportionment based on the tracer measurements revealed dynamic changes in source contributions under different atmospheric conditions.

Sea level rise is a clear example of the implications of climate change with a further committed rise of at least 2–3 m embedded within the Earth System from +1.5°C of global warming. A bold suggestion to reduce sea level rise is to install underwater barriers to reduce the inflow of oceanic heat around Antarctica and Greenland. Inflow of warm, saline water masses drives ice melt and the destabilization of tidewater glaciers. Whilst the basic theory that barriers would stem oceanic heat flow is uncontroversial, the extent to which barriers might reduce future ice mass loss is less certain. There are numerous concerns about the viability and side‐effects of this proposed intervention. We use existing field observations and representative fjord‐scale models for the Greenland's largest glacier, Sermeq Kujalleq in the Ilulissat Icefjord, to suggest that there is already sufficient evidence to conclude that artificial barrier installation would have negative regional implications for marine productivity. The effects on fisheries are a concern as negative implications for Greenland's regional fisheries are unlikely to be socially acceptable. Increasing “geoengineeringization” of the Earth Sciences is likely to continue in coming decades as society grapples with the challenges of slowing climate change and mitigating its consequences. To produce beneficial results, the technical and social viabilities of geoengineering concepts need to be considered in parallel, with the latter determined in a complex social, economic and cultural nexus."

However, the probability of detection for moderate or greater (MOG) intensity turbulence is lower than 0.1, mainly due to the discrepancy between the employed lognormal EDR climatology as based on previous research and that observed in this study. Therefore, the IFS‐CAT is recalibrated with an updated observation‐based EDR climatology.

Motivated by observations linking low inertial stability in the TC outflow layer to eyewall replacement cycles, we investigate how variations in outflow‐layer inertial stability control both the initiation and radial position of SEF. Idealized simulations reveal that reduced outflow‐layer inertial stability enhances upper‐level divergence and updraft in the TC outer core, fostering the growth of stratiform rainbands. By averaging secondary circulation over the domain grids featuring stratiform precipitation, it is explicitly shown that the strength of the mesoscale descending inflow (MDI) is greater within the widespread and more developed stratiform clouds. Such stratiform‐induced MDI can dynamically and thermodynamically broaden the tangential wind field in the lower altitudes. As a result, the ensuing increase in boundary‐layer inertial stability and inflow supplies greater absolute vorticity influx in the outer‐core region, making the tangential wind tendency peaks and the secondary eyewall intensifies at a larger radius. This study highlights the role of MDI in the coupling between the upper‐ and lower‐tropospheric dynamics."

The combined effects of synoptic patterns and local topography on the spatiotemporal variations of extreme rainfall in the summers from 2008 to 2020 have been investigated using an objective classification method. Results show that extreme rainfall in the DM mainly occurs under two typical synoptic patterns (P1 and P2). In the lower troposphere, the P1 type is characterized by southwesterly (easterly) winds south (north) to the DM, while the P2 type features southwesterly winds over the DM. These differences arise from the varying position of the Meiyu front. Under both types, extreme rainfall intensity reaches its diurnal maximum at around 09:00 local solar time (LST) because the low‐level southwesterly ageostrophic wind peaks in the early morning induced by inertial oscillation. The southwesterly ageostrophic winds bring abundant water vapor into the DM, resulting in the extreme rainfall along the windward slope. Extreme rainfall intensity decreases rapidly after 09:00 LST under the P2 type but sustains its maximum level for several hours under the P1 type. Two factors contribute to the prolonged high extreme rainfall intensity under the P1 type. One is the convergence between southwesterly and northeasterly ageostrophic flows over the DM. The other is the strengthening of the low‐level vortice over the DM from late morning to early afternoon. Overall, the synoptic patterns influence extreme rainfall by regulating the low‐level ageostrophic winds and the interactions between multi‐scale systems and the DM."

Ambient particles, collected at the surface with the DRUM samplers in four aerodynamic diameter size ranges (>3, 3–1.2, 1.2–0.34, and 0.34–0.15 μm), were analyzed in offline cold‐stage ice nucleation experiments. The INP population in Greater Houston is complex, varying by site and day, but can be generalized by a weak to moderately efficient mode of INPs at −24°C and an efficient mode at −15°C. Analysis reveals that supermicron particles are largely responsible for ice nucleation warmer than −20°C across the region while submicron particles dominate at temperatures colder than −20°C. Additionally, significant spatial diversity in the INP population was observed, with differences in mean nucleation temperature between sites for nearly every size cut. Although INP concentrations were typically ∼0.08 L−1 at −20°C throughout the campaign, a notable region‐wide increase in INP concentration for particles freezing at temperatures warmer than −20°C occurred from mid‐August to mid‐September.

Comparisons of temperature, humidity, and lowest‐cloud base heights between ERA5 and observations rule these factors out as large contributors to the DLW flux biases. The similarity between observed DLW cloud forcing distributions for atmospheric columns containing low‐level liquid and ice‐only clouds suggests limited influence of cloud phase errors on DLW biases. Thus the most likely explanation for DLW flux biases in ERA5 is underestimated cloud optical depth, which is also consistent with DSW flux biases. Similar biases in ERA5 are found during atmospheric river (AR) events. By contrast, PWRF flux bias magnitudes are much smaller during AR events (−12 W m−2 for DSW and −2 W m−2 for DLW).

The processes contributing to such flooding (coastal and fluvial) have remained opaque to municipalities that are increasingly impacted. Here, we conduct a suite of coupled atmosphere‐hydrology‐ocean model simulations with varying forcing combinations (tide, surge, and/or river discharge) to identify the primary drivers of compound flooding during a recent AR event. We also test year 2,100 climate forcing to project how flooding and drivers may change in the future for the same event. We identify a clear distinction between dynamics in the downstream, engineered portion of the DRE compared to the upstream, “natural” river. Downstream, tides dominate water levels but contributions from storm surge and nonlinear tide‐surge interaction elevate tide‐only high waters from no flooding to major flooding. Upstream, total water levels during the event are ∼6 cm higher than downstream due to an increasing influence of river discharge over surge and tides. Notably, nonlinear surge‐river and tide‐river interactions act to reduce upstream water levels up to 50% compared to estimates which linearly sum tides, surge, and river, likely reducing flood vulnerability. Under two future climate scenarios: one with only sea level rise (SLR) and another with SLR plus atmospheric warming, we find little change in mechanism contributions to water levels. Expanded flooding in both cases is largely due to SLR, as a ∼50% increase to river discharge under the warming scenario has no impact downstream and marginally increases (∼3 cm) water level upstream."

 Conditional deletion of Caspase-8 in epidermal keratinocytes (Casp8E-KO) causes necroptosis-driven lethal dermatitis1-7. Here, we discover that Casp8 loss leads to accumulation of cytosolic DNA responsible for the activation of a cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon (IFN) gene (STING)-mediated transcriptional program. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicate that STING upregulates both Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP1), and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Combined Casp8-deficiency- and STING-activation-driven accumulation of Z-nuclei acids, activates ZBP1 and triggers formation of a ZBP1–RIPK1–RIPK3 complex independently of FADD-RIPK1-RIPK3 complex enabling necroptosis execution. Genetically, we reveal a functional overlap between STING and ZBP1 as drivers of lethal dermatitis independently of TNFR1, uncovering a novel aetiology of necroptotic inflammation. Since gain-of-function mutations in human STING cause STING-Associated Vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI), we assessed the role of STING-induced necroptosis in SAVI’s aetiology. Chronic activation of STING in patients orchestrates a necroptotic transcriptional program which is confirmed in the N153S-SAVI preclinical mouse model where immune cell–driven pathology and lethality are remarkably rescued by RIPK3 co-deletion. These findings establish STING-driven ZBP1-mediated necroptosis as a central pathogenic mechanism in both Casp8-deficient inflammation and SAVI and suggest that targeting the ZBP1-RIPK3-MLKL axis holds therapeutic potential for interferonopathies characterised by excessive necroptosis."

 The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) anchors a conserved signalling pathway that regulates growth in response to nutrient availability1–5. Amino acids activate mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which are regulated by GATOR, a supercomplex consisting of GATOR1, KICSTOR and the nutrient-sensing hub GATOR2 (refs. 6–9). GATOR2 forms an octagonal cage, with its distinct WD40 domain β-propellers interacting with GATOR1 and the leucine sensors Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 (SESN1 and SESN2) and the arginine sensor CASTOR1 (ref. 10). The mechanisms through which these sensors regulate GATOR2 and how they detach from it upon binding their cognate amino acids remain unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of a stabilized GATOR2 bound to either Sestrin2 or CASTOR1. The sensors occupy distinct and non-overlapping binding sites, disruption of which selectively impairs the ability of mTORC1 to sense individual amino acids. We also resolved the apo (leucine-free) structure of Sestrin2 and characterized the amino acid-induced structural rearrangements within Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 that trigger their dissociation from GATOR2. Binding of either sensor restricts the dynamic WDR24 β-propeller of GATOR2, a domain essential for nutrient-dependent mTORC1 activation. These findings reveal the allosteric mechanisms that convey amino acid sufficiency to GATOR2 and the ensuing structural changes that lead to mTORC1 activation. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the interactions of Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 with GATOR2 were resolved, revealing how mTORC1 activation is regulated and how nutrient availability triggers signalling for cellular growth."

 Alcohol-use disorder and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are major causes of death and liver transplantation1. The gut–liver axis has a crucial yet poorly understood role in ALD pathogenesis, which depends on microbial translocation. Intestinal goblet cells (GCs) educate the immune system by forming GC-associated antigen passages (GAPs) on activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 (mAChR4, also known as M4), enabling sampling of luminal antigens by lamina propria antigen-presenting cells. Here we show that chronic alcohol use in humans and mice downregulates small intestinal mAChR4 and reduces GAP formation, disrupting antimicrobial immunity. This is reversed on activation of intestinal IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST, also known as glycoprotein 130; gp130), which restores mAChR4 expression and GAP formation, enabling induction of downstream type-3 innate lymphoid cell-derived IL-22 and antimicrobial REG3 proteins. This blunts translocation of enteric bacteria to the liver, thereby conferring ALD resistance. GAP induction by GC-specific mAChR4 activation was essential and sufficient for prevention of ethanol-induced steatohepatitis. These results lay the foundation for a therapeutic approach using mAChR4 or IL6ST agonists to promote GAP formation and prevent ALD by inhibiting microbial translocation. Chronic alcohol use in humans and mice downregulates small intestinal mAChR4 and reduces goblet-cell-associated antigen passage formation, disrupting antimicrobial immunity."

 Tight control of intracellular Ca2+ levels is fundamental as they are used to control numerous signal transduction pathways1. Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) have a crucial role in this process by extruding Ca2+ against a steep concentration gradient from the cytosol to the extracellular space2. Although new details of PMCA biology are constantly being uncovered, the structural basis of the most distinguishing features of these pumps, namely, transport rates in the kilohertz range and regulation of activity by the plasma membrane phospholipid PtdIns(4,5)P2, has so far remained elusive. Here we present the structures of mouse PMCA2 in the presence and absence of its accessory subunit neuroplastin in eight different stages of its transport cycle. Combined with whole-cell recordings that accurately track PMCA-mediated Ca2+ extrusion in intact cells, these structures enable us to establish the first comprehensive transport model for a PMCA, reveal the role of disease-causing mutations and uncover the structural underpinnings of regulatory PMCA–phospholipid interaction. The transport cycle-dependent dynamics of PtdIns(4,5)P2 are fundamental for its role as a ‘latch’ promoting the fast release of Ca2+ and opening a passageway for counter-ions. These actions are required for maintaining the ultra-fast transport cycle. Moreover, we identify the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site as an unanticipated target for drug-mediated manipulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. Our work provides detailed structural insights into the uniquely fast operation of native PMCA-type Ca2+ pumps and its control by membrane lipids and drugs.

Geim,Proximity screening greatly enhances electronic quality of graphene,"Screening by a graphite gate placed at 1 nm proximity to graphene produces transformative improvement in its electronic quality, reducing charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude. 
 The electronic quality of two-dimensional systems is crucial when exploring quantum transport phenomena. In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of optimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport and quantum mobilities reaching close to 108 and 106 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively1–10. Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving, it remains comparatively lower11–17. Here we report a transformative improvement in the electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its immediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 107 cm−2 and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum mobilities reach 107 cm2 V−1 s−1, surpassing those in the highest-quality semiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport mobilities match their record9,10. This quality enables Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaux below 5 mT. Although proximity screening predictably suppresses electron–electron interactions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their energy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3–5 compared with unscreened devices, demonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm remain robust. Our results offer a reliable route to improving electronic quality in graphene and other two-dimensional systems, which should facilitate the exploration of new physics previously obscured by disorder.

 B-1 cells are innate-like immune cells abundant in serosal cavities with antibodies enriched in bacterial recognition, yet their existence in humans has been controversial1–3. The CD5+ B-1a subset expresses anti-inflammatory molecules including IL-10, PDL1 and CTLA4 and can be immunoregulatory4–6. Unlike conventional B cells that are continuously replenished, B-1a cells are produced early in life and maintained through self-renewal7. Here we show that the transcription factors TCF1 and LEF1 are critical regulators of B-1a cells. LEF1 expression is highest in fetal and bone marrow B-1 progenitors, whereas the levels of TCF1 are higher in splenic and peritoneal B-1 cells than in B-1 progenitors. TCF1–LEF1 double deficient mice have reduced B-1a cells and defective B-1a cell maintenance. These transcription factors promote MYC-dependent metabolic pathways and induce a stem-like population upon activation, partly via IL-10 production. In the absence of TCF1 and LEF1, B-1 cells proliferate excessively and acquire an exhausted phenotype with reduced IL-10 and PDL1 expression. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of B-1 cells lacking TCF1 and LEF1 fails to suppress brain inflammation. These transcription factors are also expressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B cells and in a B-1-like population that is abundant in pleural fluid and circulation of some patients with pleural infection. Our findings define a TCF1–LEF1-driven transcriptional program that integrates stemness and regulatory function in B-1a cells.

 Small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) contain near-universal loss-of-function mutations in RB1 and TP53, compromising the G1–S checkpoint and leading to dysregulated E2F activity1. Other cancers similarly disrupt the G1–S checkpoint through loss of CDKN2A or amplification of cyclin D or cyclin E, also resulting in excessive E2F activity2,3. Although E2F activation is essential for cell cycle progression, hyperactivation promotes apoptosis4–9, presenting a therapeutic vulnerability. Cyclin proteins use a conserved hydrophobic patch to bind to substrates bearing short linear RxL motifs10–13. Cyclin A represses E2F through an RxL-dependent interaction10,14, which, when disrupted, hyperactivates E2F15. However, this substrate interface has remained difficult to target. Here we developed cell-permeable, orally bioavailable macrocyclic peptides that inhibit RxL-mediated interactions of cyclins with their substrates. Dual inhibitors of cyclin A and cyclin B RxL motifs (cyclin A/Bi) selectively kill SCLC cells and other cancer cells with high E2F activity. Genetic screens revealed that cyclin A/Bi induces apoptosis through cyclin B- and CDK2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Mechanistically, cyclin A/Bi hyperactivates E2F and cyclin B by blocking cyclin A–E2F and cyclin B–MYT1 RxL interactions. Notably, cyclin A/Bi promoted the formation of neomorphic cyclin B–CDK2 complexes, which drive spindle assembly checkpoint activation and mitotic cell death. Finally, orally administered cyclin A/Bi showed robust anti-tumour activity in chemotherapy-resistant SCLC patient-derived xenografts. These findings reveal gain-of-function mechanisms through which cyclin A/Bi triggers apoptosis and support their development for E2F-driven cancers. Dual cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors selectively kill small cell lung cancer cells and other cancer cells with high E2F activity."

 Doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors1,2. To describe the competition between tunnelling t of hole dopants and AFM spin interactions J, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic t–J model3 and the direct analogue quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought4,5. Here we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) tunnellings t′ (refs. 6–10) and hard-core bosonic holes11 using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We use coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes12, to implement a tunable bosonic t–J–V model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for |t/J| ≪ 1 and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnellings t′ and perturbative pair tunnelling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of t. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets.

 Central to our understanding of chemical reactivity is the principle of mass conservation1, which is fundamental for ensuring physical consistency, balancing equations and guiding reaction design. However, data-driven computational models2–9 for tasks such as reaction product prediction rarely abide by this most basic constraint10–13. Here we recast the problem of reaction prediction as a problem of electron redistribution using the modern deep generative framework of flow matching14–16, explicitly conserving both mass and electrons through the bond-electron (BE) matrix representation17,18. Our model, FlowER, overcomes limitations inherent in previous approaches by enforcing exact mass conservation, resolving hallucinatory failure modes, recovering mechanistic reaction sequences for unseen substrate scaffolds and generalizing effectively to out-of-domain reaction classes with extremely data-efficient fine-tuning. FlowER also enables downstream estimation of thermodynamic or kinetic feasibility and manifests a degree of chemical intuition in reaction prediction tasks.

Using coherent microwave control of the enhanced-yellow-fluorescent-protein spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a (16 ± 2) μs coherence time under Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill decoupling. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically detected magnetic resonance in bacterial cells at room temperature with contrast up to 8%. Our results introduce fluorescent proteins as a powerful qubit platform that paves the way for applications in the life sciences, such as nanoscale field sensing and spin-based imaging modalities. An optically addressable fluorescent-protein spin qubit is realized using enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; the qubit can be coherently controlled at liquid-nitrogen temperatures and the spin detected at room temperature in cells."

 Nuclear fusion research for energy applications aims to create conditions that release more energy than required to initiate the fusion process1. To generate meaningful amounts of energy, fuels such as deuterium need to be spatially confined to increase the collision probability of particles2–4. We therefore set out to investigate whether electrochemically loading a metal lattice with deuterium fuel could increase the probability of nuclear fusion events. Here we report a benchtop fusion reactor that enabled us to bombard a palladium metal target with deuterium ions. These deuterium ions undergo deuterium–deuterium fusion reactions within the palladium metal. We showed that the in situ electrochemical loading of deuterium into the palladium target resulted in a 15(2)% increase in deuterium–deuterium fusion rates. This experiment shows how the electrochemical loading of a metal target at the electronvolt energy scale can affect nuclear reactions at the megaelectronvolt energy scale.

 Cellular plasticity is a principal feature of vertebrate adaptation, tissue repair and tumorigenesis1,2. However, the mechanisms that regulate the stability of somatic cell fates remain unclear. Here, we use the somatic plasticity of thymic epithelial cells, which facilitates the selection of a self-discriminating T cell repertoire3, as a physiological model system to show that fluctuations in background chromatin accessibility in nucleosome-dense regions are amplified during thymic epithelial maturation for the ectopic expression of genes restricted to other specialized cell types. This chromatin destabilization was not dependent on AIRE-induced transcription but was preceded by repression of the tumour suppressor p53. Augmenting p53 activity indirectly stabilized chromatin, inhibited ectopic transcription, limited cellular plasticity and caused multi-organ autoimmunity. Genomic regions with heightened chromatin accessibility noise were selectively enriched for nucleosome-destabilizing polymeric AT tracts and were associated with elevated baseline DNA damage and transcriptional initiation. Taken together, our findings define molecular levers that modulate cell fate integrity and are used by thymic epithelial cells for immunological tolerance. The activity of the tumour-suppressor protein p53 is repressed in the thymus to augment fluctuations in background chromatin accessibility as a means of mediating ectopic gene expression and immune tolerance."

 Human-caused climate change worsens with every increment of additional warming, although some impacts can develop abruptly. The potential for abrupt changes is far less understood in the Antarctic compared with the Arctic, but evidence is emerging for rapid, interacting and sometimes self-perpetuating changes in the Antarctic environment. A regime shift has reduced Antarctic sea-ice extent far below its natural variability of past centuries, and in some respects is more abrupt, non-linear and potentially irreversible than Arctic sea-ice loss. A marked slowdown in Antarctic Overturning Circulation is expected to intensify this century and may be faster than the anticipated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slowdown. The tipping point for unstoppable ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be exceeded even under best-case CO2 emission reduction pathways, potentially initiating global tipping cascades. Regime shifts are occurring in Antarctic and Southern Ocean biological systems through habitat transformation or exceedance of physiological thresholds, and compounding breeding failures are increasing extinction risk. Amplifying feedbacks are common between these abrupt changes in the Antarctic environment, and stabilizing Earth’s climate with minimal overshoot of 1.5 °C will be imperative alongside global adaptation measures to minimise and prepare for the far-reaching impacts of Antarctic and Southern Ocean abrupt changes.

 Honeybees are important crop pollinators, but they increasingly face pollen starvation as a result of agricultural intensification and climate change1. Frequent flowering dearth periods and high-density rearing conditions weaken colonies, which often leads to their demise2. Beekeepers provide colonies with pollen substitutes, but these feeds do not sustain brood production because they lack essential sterols found in pollen3,4. Here we describe a technological advance in honeybee nutrition with wide-reaching impacts on global food security. We first measured the quantity and proportion of sterols present in honeybee tissues. Using this information, we genetically engineered a strain of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce a mixture of essential sterols for bees and incorporated this yeast strain into an otherwise nutritionally complete diet. Colonies exclusively fed with this diet reared brood for significantly longer than those fed diets without suitable sterols. The use of this method to incorporate sterol supplements into pollen substitutes will enable honeybee colonies to produce brood in the absence of floral pollen. Optimized diets created using this yeast strain could also reduce competition between bee species for access to natural floral resources and stem the decline in wild bee populations.

 Stars are initially powered by the fusion of hydrogen to helium. These ashes serve as fuel in a series of stages1–3, transforming massive stars into a structure of shells. These are composed of natal hydrogen on the outside and consecutively heavier compositions inside, predicted to be dominated by He, C/O, O/Ne/Mg and O/Si/S (refs. 4,5). Silicon and sulfur are fused into iron, leading to the collapse of the core and either a supernova explosion or the formation of a black hole6–9. Stripped stars, in which the outer hydrogen layer has been removed and the internal He-rich or even the C/O layer below it is exposed10, provide evidence for this shell structure and the cosmic element production mechanism it reflects. The supernova types that arise from stripped stars embedded in shells of circumstellar material (CSM) confirm this scenario11–15. However, direct evidence for the most interior shells, which are responsible for producing elements heavier than oxygen, is lacking. Here we report the discovery of the supernova (SN) 2021yfj resulting from a star stripped to its O/Si/S-rich layer. We directly observe a thick, massive Si/S-rich shell, expelled by the progenitor shortly before the supernova explosion. Exposing such an inner stellar layer is theoretically challenging and probably requires a rarely observed mass-loss mechanism. This rare supernova event reveals advanced stages of stellar evolution, forming heavier elements, including silicon, sulfur and argon, than those detected on the surface of any known class of massive stars.

 Understanding oxide reduction is critical for advancing metal production1,2, catalysis3,4 and energy technologies5. Although carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) are widely used reductants, the mechanisms by which they work are often presumed to be similar, both involving lattice oxygen removal6–9. However, because of growing interest in replacing CO with H2 to lower CO2 emissions, distinguishing gas-specific reduction pathways is critical. Yet, capturing these atomic-scale processes under reactive gas and high-temperature conditions remains challenging. Here we use environmental transmission electron microscopy, which is capable of real-time, atomic-resolution imaging of gas–solid redox reactions10–16, to directly visualize the gas-dependent oxide reduction dynamics in NiO. We show that CO drives surface nucleation and the growth of metallic Ni islands, leading to self-limiting surface metallization. Conversely, H2 activates a coupled surface-to-bulk transformation, where protons from dissociated H2 infiltrate the oxide lattice to promote the inward migration of surface-generated oxygen vacancies and enabling bulk metallization. By contrast, oxygen vacancies formed by CO remain confined near the surface, where they rapidly form a metallic Ni layer that inhibits further reduction. These results reveal distinct atomistic pathways for CO and H2 and provide insights that may guide metallurgical processes and catalyst design.

 Perineural invasion (PNI) is a well-established factor of poor prognosis in multiple cancer types1, yet its mechanism remains unclear. Here we provide clinical and mechanistic insights into the role of PNI and cancer-induced nerve injury (CINI) in resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study demonstrates that PNI and CINI of tumour-associated nerves are associated with poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy among patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and gastric cancer. Electron microscopy and electrical conduction analyses reveal that cancer cells degrade the nerve fibre myelin sheets. The injured neurons respond by autonomously initiating IL-6- and type I interferon-mediated inflammation to promote nerve healing and regeneration. As the tumour grows, the CINI burden increases, and its associated inflammation becomes chronic and skews the general immune tone within the tumour microenvironment into a suppressive and exhaustive state. The CINI-driven anti-PD-1 resistance can be reversed by targeting multiple steps in the CINI signalling process: denervating the tumour, conditional knockout of the transcription factor mediating the injury signal within neurons (Atf3), knockout of interferon-α receptor signalling (Ifnar1−/−) or by combining anti-PD-1 and anti-IL-6-receptor blockade. Our findings demonstrate the direct immunoregulatory roles of CINI and its therapeutic potential.

 Nitrous oxide (N2O), a driver of global warming and climate change, has reached unprecedented concentrations in Earth’s atmosphere1. Current N2O sources outpace N2O sinks, emphasizing the need for comprehensive understanding of processes that consume N2O. Microbes that express the enzyme N2O reductase (N2OR) convert N2O to climate change-neutral dinitrogen (N2). Known N2ORs belong to the canonical clade I and clade II NosZ reductases and are considered key enzymes for N2O reduction2–4. Here we report a previously unrecognized protein family with a role in N2O reduction, clade III lactonase-type N2OR (L-N2OR), which diverges in sequence from canonical NosZ but conserves three-dimensional protein structural features. Integrated physiological, metagenomic, proteomic and structural modelling studies demonstrate that L-N2ORs catalyse N2O reduction. L-N2OR genes occur in several phyla, predominantly in uncultured taxa with broad geographic distribution. Our findings expand the known diversity of N2ORs and implicate previously unrecognized taxa (for example, Nitrospinota) in N2O consumption. The expansion of N2OR diversity and the identification of a novel type of catalyst for N2O reduction advances the understanding of N2O sinks, has implications for greenhouse gas emission and climate change modelling, and expands opportunities for innovative biotechnologies aimed at curbing N2O emissions5,6.

 Polyamines are regulatory metabolites with key roles in transcription, translation, cell signalling and autophagy1. They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders, including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration, and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels2. Polyamines have been linked to pain, showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models3. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. Here, undertaking a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK Biobank (UKB), we found a significant association between pain intensity and variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system, Slc45a4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron subtypes within the dorsal root ganglion, including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, and the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals a regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat- and algogen-induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of C-polymodal nociceptors. Our findings therefore establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.

 Living cells depend on an intricate network of chemical reactions catalysed by enzymes, which sometimes make mistakes that lead to their inactivation. Here we report a metabolite-based mechanism for preserving enzyme function in an unfavourable environment. We found that the enzyme TGDS produces UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose, a mimic of the reaction intermediate of the enzyme UXS1, which regenerates the essential cofactor NAD+ within the catalytic pocket of UXS1 by completing its catalytic cycle. Thus, the production of an ‘enzyme-rescue metabolite’ by TGDS represents a mechanism for maintaining the activity of an enzyme in a subcellular compartment where NAD+ is scarce. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that the inability to produce sufficient amounts of this enzyme-rescue metabolite leads to the inactivation of UXS1, impairing the synthesis of specific glycans that are crucial for skeletal development. This provides an explanation for the development of the hereditary skeletal disorder Catel–Manzke syndrome in individuals with TGDS deficiency. Defects in similar protective layers might contribute to metabolic changes in other diseases that cannot be explained with common concepts in metabolic biochemistry.

 Eukaryotic cells produce over 1,000 different lipid species that tune organelle membrane properties, control signalling and store energy1,2. How lipid species are selectively sorted between organelles to maintain specific membrane identities is largely unclear, owing to the difficulty of imaging lipid transport in cells3. Here we measured the retrograde transport and metabolism of individual lipid species in mammalian cells using time-resolved fluorescence imaging of bifunctional lipid probes in combination with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry and mathematical modelling. Quantification of lipid flux between organelles revealed that directional, non-vesicular lipid transport is responsible for fast, species-selective lipid sorting, in contrast to the slow, unspecific vesicular membrane trafficking. Using genetic perturbations, we found that coupling between energy-dependent lipid flipping and non-vesicular transport is a mechanism for directional lipid transport. Comparison of metabolic conversion and transport rates showed that non-vesicular transport dominates the organelle distribution of lipids, while species-specific phospholipid metabolism controls neutral lipid accumulation. Our results provide the first quantitative map of retrograde lipid flux in cells4. We anticipate that our pipeline for mapping of lipid flux through physical and chemical space in cells will boost our understanding of lipids in cell biology and disease.

 Considerable advances have been made in characterizing bioactive molecules secreted by bacteria, yet the regulatory elements controlling their production remain largely understudied. Here we identify and characterize the N-acyl-cyclolysine (ACL) system—a cell-density-dependent chemical signalling system specific to and widespread in the phylum Bacteroidota (formerly Bacteroidetes)—and show that it regulates the expression of co-localized operons encoding diverse secreted molecules. Using genetic and biochemical analyses, combined with structural studies of a key biosynthetic enzyme, AclA, we elucidate the molecular structure of various ACLs and their complete biosynthetic pathway involving l-lysine acylation and ATP-dependent cyclization. Furthermore, we find that secreted ACLs are sensed by a dedicated transcription factor, AclR, resulting in the expression of associated operons and the autoinduction of ACL biosynthesis. Moreover, we show that different Bacteroidota strains produce structurally diverse ACLs and encode transcription factors with varying ligand specificities. Finally, we find that the acl circuit is widely distributed and transcribed in human gut and oral microbiome samples, with clear evidence for an active role in regulating associated operons under host colonization conditions. Understanding the function of the ACL system in different contexts has the potential to reveal details about the biology, ecology and chemistry of the Bacteroidota and how members of this phylum interact with their environments and hosts.

 Laser-based displays are highly sought after for their superior brightness and colour performance1, especially in advanced applications such as augmented reality (AR)2. However, their broader use has been hindered by bulky projector designs and complex optical module assemblies3. Here we introduce a laser display architecture enabled by large-scale visible photonic integrated circuits (PICs)4–7 to address these challenges. Unlike previous projector-style laser displays, this architecture features an ultra-thin, flat-panel form factor, replacing bulky free-space illumination modules with a single, high-performance photonic chip. Centimetre-scale PIC devices, which integrate thousands of distinct optical components on-chip, are carefully tailored to achieve high display uniformity, contrast and efficiency. We demonstrate a 2-mm-thick flat-panel laser display combining the PIC with a liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) panel8,9, achieving 211% of the colour gamut and more than 80% volume reduction compared with traditional LCoS displays. We further showcase its application in a see-through AR system. Our work represents an advancement in the integration of nanophotonics with display technologies, enabling a range of new display concepts, from high-performance immersive displays to slim-panel 3D holography.

 Animals require undisturbed periods of rest during which they undergo recuperative processes1. However, it is unclear how brain states arise that are able to dissociate an animal from its external world, enabling quiescent behaviours, while retaining vigilance to salient sensory cues2. Here we describe a neural mechanism in Drosophila that creates neural filters that engender a brain state that enables quiescent behaviour by generating coherent slow-wave activity (SWA)3 between sleep-need4 (R5)- and locomotion-promoting neural networks5. The coherence of SWA is subject to circadian and homeostatic control and can be modulated by sensory experience. Mimicry of coherent SWA reveals that R5 oscillations reduce responsiveness to visual stimuli by rhythmically associating neural activity of locomotion-promoting cells, effectively overruling their output. These networks can regulate behavioural responsiveness by providing antagonistic inputs to downstream head-direction cells6,7. Thus, coherent oscillations provide the mechanistic basis for a neural filter by temporally associating opposing signals, resulting in reduced functional connectivity between locomotion-gating and navigational networks. We propose that the temporal pattern of SWA provides the structure to create a ‘breakable’ filter, permitting the animal to enter a quiescent state, while providing the architecture for strong or salient stimuli to ‘break’ the neural interaction, consequently allowing the animal to react. In Drosophila, coherent slow-wave activity between sleep-promoting and locomotion-promoting neural networks provides a brain state structure that allows for quiescent behaviours."

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and highly therapy-resistant brain tumour1,2. Although advanced disease has been intensely investigated, the mechanisms that underpin the earlier, likely more tractable, stages of GBM development remain poorly understood. Here we identify axonal injury as a key driver of GBM progression, which we find is induced in white matter by early tumour cells preferentially expanding in this region. Mechanistically, axonal injury promotes gliomagenesis by triggering Wallerian degeneration, a targetable active programme of axonal death3, which we show increases neuroinflammation and tumour proliferation. Inactivation of SARM1, the key enzyme activated in response to injury that mediates Wallerian degeneration4, was sufficient to break this tumour-promoting feedforward loop, leading to the development of less advanced terminal tumours and prolonged survival in mice. Thus, targeting the tumour-induced injury microenvironment may supress progression from latent to advanced disease, thereby providing a potential strategy for GBM interception and control. Axonal injury, induced in the white matter by expansion of early tumour cells, is a key driver of glioblastoma progression."

 Earth’s lithosphere is fragmented into tectonic plates that move relative to each other and the mantle, following a dynamic equilibrium that evolves over time. Sporadically, abrupt kinematic changes occur that typically lead to regional-scale plate reconfigurations, and hypothetically to global-scale events, affecting the motion of all major plates. Identifying and understanding such global plate reorganizations has proven challenging because of the geometric nature of plate tectonic theory and the scarcity of preserved kinematic changes. Here we combine Earth-like global mantle convection with topological data analysis to show that global plate reorganization events can emerge from mantle–lithosphere interactions. Unlike regional changes, during these rare global events, the entire plate network shifts to a new dynamic equilibrium by the formation and destruction of plate boundaries at global scale, affecting the dynamics of the entire mantle. Such events represent transitions between two stable states in the coupled mantle–plates system. Our findings suggest that Earth may have experienced a similar global tectonic reorganization during the mid-Eocene around 47 million years ago. Our new approach provides a quantitative framework to unveil mantle–lithosphere interactions from global geodynamic models.

 Pumpkin rootstock is commonly used to graft cucurbit crops, improving their ability to withstand stress. While the significance of systemic signals from rootstocks to scions is recognized, the role of root-to-shoot transported mRNAs remains understudied. Cucumber plants often face growth and productivity limitations due to low temperatures. To shed light on the enhancement of chilling tolerance in grafted cucumber scions by pumpkin-derived mRNAs, we revisit the metabolomic and transcriptomic dataset from the cucumber/pumpkin heterograft under chilling condition. We identify pumpkin Ketol-acid reductoisomerase 1 (CmoKARI1) as the key mobile mRNA that specifically travels from pumpkin rootstock to cucumber scion upon early chilling stress. Overexpressing CmoKARI1 results in increased isoleucine level and chilling tolerance in both cucumber and Arabidopsis. The increased isoleucine is further used to synthesize JA-Ile conjugates, activating JA-Ile signaling and enabling heterografts to weather low temperatures. This study represents the instance of a unidirectional mobile mRNA triggered by specific environmental cues.

 Planar polaritonic lenses, achieved by precisely controlling interface polaritons, hold significant promise for subwavelength light focusing. While most existing designs rely on polariton interference or refraction, creating gradient-index polaritonic lenses remains a substantial challenge due to the lack of practical and cost-effective fabrication methods. Here, we introduce a lithography-free approach for producing polaritonic lenses with gradient effective refractive indices by engineering the dielectric environment of polaritons. This method involves in situ transformation of polymer microspheres into spherical caps through controlled melting, allowing the fabrication of polaritonic Luneburg lenses with focal spots as small as λ0/18, where λ0 is the free-space wavelength. Our approach could also apply to other gradient-index polaritonic lenses, such as Maxwell fisheye lenses and Mikaelian lenses, based on a wide range of in-plane isotropic polariton modes.

 Light can serve as a tunable trigger for neurobioengineering technologies, enabling probing, control, and enhancement of brain function with unmatched spatiotemporal precision. Yet, these technologies often require genetic or structural alterations of neurons, disrupting their natural activity. Here, we introduce the Graphene-Mediated Optical Stimulation (GraMOS) platform, which leverages graphene’s optoelectronic properties and its ability to efficiently convert light into electricity. Using GraMOS in longitudinal studies, we found that repeated optical stimulation enhances the maturation of hiPSC-derived neurons and brain organoids, underscoring GraMOS’s potential for regenerative medicine and neurodevelopmental studies. To explore its potential for disease modeling, we applied short-term GraMOS to Alzheimer’s stem cell models, uncovering disease-associated alterations in neuronal activity. Finally, we demonstrated a proof-of-concept for neuroengineering applications by directing robotic movements with GraMOS-triggered signals from graphene-interfaced brain organoids. By enabling precise, non-invasive neural control across timescales from milliseconds to months, GraMOS opens new avenues in neurodevelopment, disease treatment, and robotics.

 The intricate landscape of tRNA modification presents persistent analytical challenges, which have impeded efforts to simultaneously resolve sequence, modification, and aminoacylation state at the level of individual tRNAs. To address these challenges, we introduce “aa-tRNA-seq”, an integrated method that uses chemical ligation to sandwich the amino acid of a charged tRNA in between the body of the tRNA and an adaptor oligonucleotide, followed by high throughput nanopore sequencing. Our approach reveals the identity of the amino acids attached to all tRNAs in a cellular sample, at the single molecule level. We describe machine learning models that enable the accurate identification of amino acid identities based on the unique signal distortions generated by the interactions between the amino acid in the RNA backbone and the nanopore motor protein and reader head. We apply aa-tRNA-seq to characterize the impact of the loss of specific tRNA modification enzymes, confirming the hypomodification-associated instability of specific tRNAs, and identifying additional candidate targets of modification. Our studies lay the groundwork for understanding the efficiency and fidelity of tRNA aminoacylation as a function of tRNA sequence, modification, and environmental conditions.

 Full characterization of light intensity, polarization, and spectrum is essential for applications in sensing, communication and imaging. However, existing schemes rely on discrete, bulky components to capture polarization and spectrum separately, and suffer from detecting only a few values in each dimension. Here, we implement a compact disordered-guiding photonic chip with a neural network for single-shot high-dimensional light field detection. The disordered region introduces complex interference and scattering among polarized components, while the guiding region efficiently collects the outputs to on-chip photodetectors. This design encodes high-dimensional input into multi-channel intensities with high sensitivity, subsequently decoded by the neural network. Experimentally, the accurate detection of broad spectrum with mixed full-Stokes polarization states is realized with a polarization error of 1.2° and spectral resolution as high as 400 pm. Furthermore, the device demonstrates high-dimensional imaging with superior recognition performance over single-dimensional methods.

Here, the authors report the cryo-EM structure of E. histolytica ribosomes from its disease-causing, trophozoite state and reveal several unique features, such as the rRNA triple helix motif. 
 Entamoeba histolytica, an anaerobic protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of amoebiasis, bloody diarrhea, and liver abscesses in humans. Amoebiasis is more predominant in tropical areas with poor sanitation conditions, and it remains the fourth leading cause of death due to a protozoan infection. E. histolytica life cycle spans between an infective ‘cyst stage’ and an active disease-causing ‘trophozoite stage’. We have isolated ribosomes from the trophozoite stage of E. histolytica. Here, we report single particle cryo-EM structures of the 53S ribosome large subunit (LSU), and 75S associated ribosomes, with P-tRNA, A/P and P/E tRNAs, and with paromomycin antibiotic, at 2.8 Å to 3.4 Å resolution. The E. histolytica possesses a reduced ribosome with a conserved core, and the periphery evolved with species-specific unique features. The most notable features are the presence of the rRNA triple helix near the peptide exit tunnel, the expansion segment H88ES102 near the exit site on LSU, and unique insertions in r-proteins. Furthermore, the 75S ribosome paromomycin complex structure provides the atomic details of its interactions. These structures provide insights into the evolutionary adaptation of the E. histolytica translational machinery and may be explored further for amoebicidal therapeutic intervention.

 Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is central to global CO2 fixation. In eukaryotic algae, its catalytic efficiency is enhanced through the pyrenoid - a protein-dense organelle within the chloroplast that concentrates CO2. Although Rubisco structure has been extensively studied in vitro, its native structure, dynamics and interactions within the pyrenoid remain elusive. Here, we present the native Rubisco structure inside the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii determined by cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging of cryo-focused ion beam milled cells. Multiple structural subsets of Rubisco are identified, stochastically distributed throughout the pyrenoid. While Rubisco adopts an active conformation in the best-resolved map, comparison among the subsets reveals significant local variations at the active site, at the large subunit dimer interfaces, and at binding protein contact regions. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of the structure, dynamics, and functional organization of native Rubisco within the pyrenoid, providing valuable insights into its critical role in CO2 fixation.

 Climate beliefs shape engagement with climate action, yet research often overlooks their interconnections. This research frames climate beliefs as a belief system and examines two structural features: density (the strength of all connections) and inconsistency (conflicts between beliefs). Using Facebook survey data from 110 geographic areas (n = 99,074), we show that global north presents higher density networks, where climate beliefs are more tightly correlated, while many global south areas have positive but less interconnected beliefs. Inconsistency appears in geographic areas where opposition to reducing fossil fuel use conflicts with support for renewable energy and government prioritization of climate policies, such as in the Middle East. Information exposure is positively correlated with density and negatively with inconsistency. Gross domestic product per capita is positively associated with density and carbon resource dependence positively correlates with inconsistency. These findings offer communication strategies to enhance climate belief endurance while addressing conflicting beliefs that may undermine climate action.

When the two commonly widespread AVOC and BVOC, toluene and isoprene, coexisted and oxidized, we observed >20% reduction in the SOA yields compared to the predicted ones from linear addition. By resolving the particle mass spectra using positive matrix factorization, we found that SOA formation from the isoprene+toluene mixture was dominated by the isoprene-related (F-ISO-1 and F-ISO-2) and toluene-related (F-TOL-1 and F-TOL-2) factors during the early and later stages, respectively. Additionally, we observed the formation of cross-products (F-MIX) between isoprene and toluene oxidation intermediates, which accounted for ~30% of the total SOA mass on average. The formation of F-MIX was accompanied by the suppression of particulate products (F-ISO-2 and F-TOL-2), which were associated with the oxidation of ISOPOOH and later-stage oxidation of toluene.

 Northwestern China (NWC) has a monsoon-like, arid and semi-arid climate with considerable decadal variability and long-term trends. Decadal prediction of summer precipitation remains challenging due to the mixed influence of external forcing and internal variability. This study shows that the decadal internal variability of domain-averaged summer precipitation over NWC (NWCP) primarily originates from the extratropical North Atlantic dipole (NAD) sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA), which excite a Eurasian Rossby wave train by enhancing the transient eddy forcing. The resultant anomalous Mongolian cyclone increases the NWCP through the cyclonic vorticity-generated upward moisture transport. By combining this empirical relationship and dynamical models’ predicted NAD SSTA, we attempted a hybrid dynamic-empirical model to predict the decadal internal variability component. After adding the external forcing component, the model can predict the decadal NWCP 7–10 years in advance. Our result opens a pathway for decadal prediction of precipitation in central Eurasia’s dry regions."

 Groundwater health is increasingly threatened by climate change, which alters precipitation patterns, leading to groundwater recharge shifts. These shifts impact subsurface microbial communities, crucial for maintaining ecosystem functions. In this decade-long study of carbonate aquifers, we analyzed 815 bacterial 16S rRNA gene datasets, 226 dissolved organic matter (DOM) profiles, 387 metabolomic datasets, and 174 seepage microbiomes. Our findings reveal distinct short- and long-term temporal patterns of groundwater microbiomes driven by environmental fluctuations. Microbiomes of hydrologically connected aquifers exhibit lower temporal stability due to stochastic processes and greater susceptibility to surface disturbances, yet demonstrate remarkable resilience. Conversely, more isolated aquifer microbiomes resist short-term changes, governed by deterministic processes, but exhibit reduced stability under prolonged stress. Variability in seepage-associated microorganisms, DOM, and metabolic diversity further drives microbiome dynamics. These findings highlight the dual vulnerability of groundwater systems to acute or chronic pressures and the need for sustainable management to mitigate hydroclimatic extremes.

 The South Pacific Convergence Zone is a band of intense austral summer rainfall in the tropical Pacific. Changes in the South Pacific Convergence Zone are linked to Pacific sea surface temperatures on decadal timescales, but its behaviour and impacts over longer timescales remain poorly understood due to limited proxy records and model uncertainties. We combine new plant wax hydroclimate records with existing proxy evidence and climate model simulations to investigate South Pacific Convergence Zone changes over the past 1500 years. Our findings indicate that between 1000 and 200 years ago, the eastern South Pacific Convergence Zone became wetter while the western part became drier. Model simulations suggest that these centennial-scale changes were driven by Pacific sea surface temperature gradients. This eastward shift coincides with Polynesian colonisation, implying hydroclimate shifts both ‘pushed’ migration eastward and ‘pulled’ successful eastern settlement.

 Quantifying methane emissions from riverine ecosystems is crucial for optimizing greenhouse gas control strategies. However, partitioning methane emissions between diffusion and ebullition pathways remains insufficiently investigated. Here, we developed data-driven models to separately quantify diffusive and ebullitive methane fluxes and characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of methane dynamics from rivers within the Yangtze River Basin, China. Annual methane emissions emitted from rivers across the Yangtze River Basin were estimated at 0.827 (0.751–0.903) teragrams, with ebullition dominating total emissions (accounting for 86%). Seasonal methane emissions exhibited a pattern of being higher in summer and lower in winter, while dissolved methane concentrations were higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. Urban rivers exhibited significantly higher methane concentrations, diffusive fluxes, and ebullitive fluxes than natural rivers. This study provides valuable insights for refining methane prediction models and highlights the critical contribution of ebullition to methane emissions from large-scale river systems. Ebullition is the dominant pathway for riverine methane emissions in the Yangtze River Basin, China, contributing about 86% of total annual emissions, and urban rivers have higher methane concentrations and fluxes than natural rivers, according to a data model analysis of methane concentration and flux data."

 Change detection in very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery has consistently been a focus and challenge within the remote sensing community. We present a novel unsupervised method named Progressive Self-Optimization Network. In this method, a new sample strategy is developed based on the initial change detection across three feature domains: spectral, deep, and class signal, to capture the “weak-to-strong” change signals and collect training samples with high accuracy. A new lightweight convolutional neural network is designed by partially replacing traditional convolutional layers with weight-shared partial convolution. To detect changes, a progressive self-optimization pattern is proposed based on the “weak-to-strong” change signals. This pattern detects changes gradually from regions with weak and strong change signals to regions with moderate change signals in a progressive manner. During this progressive process, detection results from each progression are integrated with “weak-to-strong” change signals to reselect training samples for the transfer training in the following progression, thus attempting to optimize the lightweight network. The final change map is generated by fusing all progression results. Five open VHR datasets and fourteen state-of-the-art unsupervised methods validate the proposed method."

 Anthropogenic emission inventories serve not only as key inputs for chemical transport models but also as essential tools for evaluating the effectiveness of emission control measures. Here, this study employed the emission inventory from Chinese Unified Atmospheric Chemistry Environment model (CCES) to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of China's anthropogenic emissions from 2015 to 2024, and to evaluate its performance in simulating aerosols and their gaseous precursors. Furthermore, this study compared CCES with the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) to explore the emission discrepancies. National total anthropogenic emissions declined markedly over the decade: sulfur dioxide (SO2) dropped by 60.8 %, while emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10) and ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia (NH3) decreased by 19.9–42.6 %. The three inventories exhibited decreases during 2015–2020, but the reduction rates for SO2, PM2.5 and PM10 slowed after 2018. Although the inventories diverged substantially in absolute magnitude, they displayed nearly identical seasonal patterns. Relative to MEIC, EDGAR reported higher industrial SO2 emissions, whereas CCES yielded higher traffic-related NOx emissions. CCES-driven simulations reproduced spatiotemporal variability of SO2, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM2.5 concentrations, albeit with negative biases for SO2 and PM2.5 and a positive bias for NO2 at most monitoring sites. Despite these remaining uncertainties, CCES can capture the dominant spatiotemporal patterns of China's emissions and thus provide valuable insights into their variability."

This study comprehensively evaluated PM2.5 levels, chemical composition, and associated health risks. PM2.5 concentrations were significantly elevated in the facilities, exceeding outdoor levels by 200–400 %.

 Air pollution, particularly PM2.5 (particles smaller than 2.5 μm), is a major environmental issue in densely populated cities like Hong Kong, as these particles can deeply penetrate the respiratory system. It has been known that tropical cyclones (TCs) can cause a significant increase in PM2.5 concentrations when positioned to the east of Hong Kong. However, the seasonal variations in how the proximity of TCs influences PM2.5 levels and aerosol optical properties in Hong Kong remain poorly understood. Using observations from 1999 to 2020, this study demonstrates that the impact of TCs on air pollution in Hong Kong is more pronounced during the summer (June to August) compared to the autumn season (September to November), primarily due to strong subsidence, surface warming, and the transport of fine-mode aerosols by northerly wind driven by eastern TCs. Conversely, western TCs efficiently remove pollutants in summer due to the influx of clean air from southerly winds, but this effect diminishes in autumn when background PM2.5 levels are high and TC-induced subsidence is absent. Further analysis of aerosol properties reveals that eastern (western) TCs tend to increase (decrease) the fine-mode fraction and decrease (increase) the fine-mode Angström exponent during the JJA season, whereas these differences are negligible during the SON season."

 Heat waves (HWs) are complex, multivariate, extreme weather events that cause significant harm to human health, ecosystems, and economies. Correct detection and attribution of HWs to anthropogenic climate change is important to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to improve predictions. In this work, we address this issue and propose a multivariate version of a hybrid approach to reconstruct heat waves, consisting of the AM and deep Autoencoders (MvEA-AM algorithm), improving existing less effective methods used until now, such as the multivariate Analogue Method (MvAM). The proposed hybrid approach produces a more reliable representation of the event than the classical MvAM for reconstructing and attributing HWs in Europe. The explainable and interpretable analysis of the obtained results is based on leveraging the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to explain deep learning algorithms, a capability that is not achievable with the MvAM.

To identify mechanisms that drive the most fundamental feature shared by all tumors—unrestricted cell proliferation—we used a multiomic approach, which identified translation and ribosome biogenesis as common targets of major oncogenic pathways across cancer types. Proteomic analysis of tumors and functional studies of cell cultures established nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 as a key node, whose convergent regulation, both transcriptionally and posttranslationally, is critical for tumor cell proliferation.

Observations from the Dawn mission revealed that Ceres likely hosted a global subsurface ocean in its early history, which was the site of pervasive aqueous alteration of accreted material. Subsurface environmental constraints inferred from Ceres’s surface mineralogy, combined with Ceres’s high abundance of carbon, suggest that the dwarf planet may have been habitable for microbial life. We present a coupled chemical and thermal evolution model tracking Ceres’s interior aqueous environment through time. If the rocky interior reached ≳550 K, then fluids released by rock metamorphism would have promoted conditions favorable for habitability by introducing redox disequilibrium into the ocean, a source of chemical energy for chemotrophs.

For example, the perovskite solar cell (PSC), a rising star of photovoltaic industry, calls for proper management of solvents likeN,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Traditional solvent recovery methods are often less effective, costly, and energy-intensive. To address this, we developed a multistage air-gap membrane distillation (MAMD) system that efficiently recovered DMF from waste solutions using industrial waste heat. Our MAMD system achieved a DMF enrichment factor up to 314 (increasing the concentration from 0.3 to 94.2 weight %) and stable operation over 60 hours. The recovered DMF (94.2 weight %) was used in perovskite minimodule fabrication, achieving a certified stabilized power output of 19.97%. The narrow efficiency deviation, state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency, and small hysteresis demonstrated the viability of using the recovered DMF in industrial fabrication. These results demonstrate the potential of our MAMD system to minimize the environmental footprint and promote sustainable PSC manufacturing."

We report a fungal defense mechanism, tandem repeat–induced sexual silencing (TRISS), active during sexual stages. TRISS is a unique RNA interference (RNAi) pathway distinct from known mechanisms like quelling and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). Triggered by tandem repeats, it involves RNAi components similar to quelling but uniquely includes the MSUD-specific Argonaute Sms2. TRISS operates independently of recombination. We identified small interfering RNA sassociated with TRISS (trasiRNAs) in tandem repeats. Sms2, guided by trasiRNAs, mediates translational repression of target mRNAs and is crucial for trasiRNA biogenesis. TRISS requires the DNA methyltransferase Rid but not Rid-mediated repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Both Sms2 and Rid interact with replication protein A (RPA) to recruit the RPA-Qde1/RdRP complex, dependent on the helicase Qde3. This study reveals a potentially conserved strategy linking RIP and RNAi to silence tandem repeats during fungal sexual stages, offering insights into fungal genome defense."

Here, we show that efficient termination by Pol I, paused by termination roadblock protein, is caused by RNA hairpin of the nascent pre-rRNA. Hairpin-dependent termination takes place at a physiological rate and does not require trans-acting factors. The function of the roadblock protein and the T-rich sequence is to synergistically cause deep backtracking of Pol I toward the termination RNA hairpin. Simultaneously, Pol I is catalytically inactivated, preventing rescue from backtracking through RNA cleavage and thus committing Pol I to termination. Termination RNA hairpins are present in most of Pol I terminators of eukaryotes, suggesting conservation of the RNA hairpin–dependent mechanism of Pol I transcription termination.

Conditional knockout ofRpa1, a representative DNA damage response factor, in early limb bud mesenchyme results in the near-total absence of forelimbs and severely underdeveloped hindlimbs. Mechanistically,Rpa1deletion leads to extensive DNA damage and activates the cGAS-STING pathway, driving transcription ofZbp1.Rpa1deletion also leads to accumulation of Z-DNA bound by ZBP1, triggering the full activation of ZBP1 and subsequent mesenchymal stem cell death through PANoptosis.

In this work, an amorphous CuPd catalyst was fabricated through incorporating Cu ions into the disordered Pd lattice, creating an amorphous monolayer architecture with engineered hydrogen transport pathways. The precisely modulated atomic/electronic configuration optimizes the adsorption configuration and bonding strength between substrate/intermediates and catalysts surfaces. The amorphous catalyst achieves 96.2% selectivity at 99.1% conversion under mild conditions, with a time of flight of 6004 hour−1. These results demonstrate that amorphous architectures, with their disordered atomic arrangements, uniformly distributed active sites, and tunable adsorption energetics, establish a generalized design framework for high-performance catalysts, achieving superior selectivity and activity compared to crystalline systems."

Here, we introduce 4-aminobenzylphosphonic acid as a functional “2H-imprison” additive that selectively bypasses the formation of the 2H phase (an iodine-rich structure) and promotes the direct crystallization of the desired 3C phase, resulting in a homogeneous phase and halide distribution. Consequently, blade-coated 1.77–electron volt–bandgap perovskite solar cells achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.35% (certified 19.72%) with an open-circuit voltage of 1.35 volts for a ~0.07–square centimeter aperture area, while 1.02–square centimeter devices delivered a PCE of 19.00%. Furthermore, the corresponding blade-coated two- and four-terminal all-perovskite TSCs demonstrated high PCEs of 27.34 and 28.46%, respectively. This study reveals the origins of phase segregation during blade coating and provides a viable strategy to mitigate it, paving the way for scalable and high-efficiency TSCs."

Nevertheless, implementing DNA circuits for such functions generally relies on the use of dual-rail expression that doubles the number of required gates, constraining the achievable complexity in a single solution. A fundamental limitation is that conventional single-rail circuits cannot support nonfirst-layer NOT operations. Here, we introduce the design of a DNA synchronizer (DSN), a temporal regulation module that enables time-dependent NOT function, to circumvent the fundamental limitation of conventional single-rail designs. Tuning the binding affinity between the DSN strand and an inverter strand allows for regulating the execution time of NOT gates at varying cascade depths. Single-rail NAND and NOR gates are implemented using DSNs, which are Boolean complete. We further demonstrate a 4-bit square root circuit using a minimal set of only five gates. This single-rail architecture holds promise for developing compact yet scalable DNA computing circuits while advancing applications in diagnostics and therapeutics."

Among these, polyglutamylation—a dominant and conserved modification targeting unstructured tubulin C-terminal tails—plays a pivotal role in defining the tubulin code. Here, we describe a mechanism by which tubulin tyrosine ligase–like 11 (TTLL11) expands and diversifies the code. Cryo–electron microscopy revealed a unique bipartite MT recognition strategy wherein TTLL11 binding and catalytic domains engage adjacent MT protofilaments. Biochemical and cellular assays identified previously uncharacterized polyglutamylation patterns, showing that TTLL11 directly extends the primary polypeptide chains of α- and β-tubulin in vitro, challenging the prevailing paradigms emphasizing lateral branching. Moreover, cell-based and in vivo data suggest a cross-talk between polyglutamylation and the detyrosination/tyrosination cycle likely linked to the TTLL11-mediated elongation of the primary α-tubulin chain. These findings unveil an unrecognized layer of complexity within the tubulin code and offer mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of functional specialization of MT cytoskeleton."

Public wolf hunting is a highly contentious strategy for mitigating these risks, yet few empirical studies examine its effectiveness in doing so. Using difference-in-differences and structural equation modeling of data from the northwestern US between 2005 and 2021, we analyzed impacts of wolf hunting on livestock predation by wolves and government removal of wolves in the same year and with a 1-year time lag while controlling for social and environmental variables. We found that public wolf hunting had a small negative effect on livestock predation but had no effect on government lethal removal of wolves in the same or subsequent years. Our findings challenge the assumption that wolf hunting is an effective management strategy for reducing livestock predation and lethal removal."

However, the growth of lithium dendrites is inevitable, driven by the intrinsic properties of SSEs. Hence, guiding the growth of lithium dendrites in a controllable way is more feasible instead of completely preventing their growth. Here, we present a strategically designed structural layer composed of graded lithium nitride particles, which guides the growth of lithium dendrites within confined spaces. Meanwhile, this layer is paired with a less lithium-stable electrolyte and enables the guided lithium dendrites to self-limit within localized regions at the interface. The comprehensive analysis further reveals that the designed bilayer SSE effectively harnesses the interface-generated pressure during battery cycling, achieving dynamic control of lithium dendrite growth. This interfacial structure design of SSE holds broad applicability for regulating lithium dendrites in all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries."

The initial stage of this Neolithic transition in Europe was instigated by the migration of farmers from Anatolia and the Aegean basin. In this study, we modeled the expansion of Neolithic farmers into central Europe along the continental route of dispersal. We used spatially explicit simulations of paleogenomic diversity and high-quality paleogenomic data from 67 prehistoric individuals to assess how population dynamics between Indigenous European hunter-gatherers and incoming farmers varied across space and time. Our results demonstrate that admixture between the two groups increased locally over time at each stage of the Neolithic expansion along the continental route. We estimate that the effective population size of farmers was about five times that of hunter-gatherers. In addition, we infer that sporadic long-distance migrations of early farmers contributed to their rapid dispersal, while competitive interactions with hunter-gatherers were limited."

Gaye,An imminent return to drought in the western Sahel?,"In the 1970s and 1980s, the semi-arid Sahel, the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, experienced spatially uniform drought, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. The recovery that ensued is projected to continue in the center and east, leaving the west out. We show that these two patterns—uniform variation and east-west contrast—are present in instrumental observations and in simulations with constant or time-varying external forcing. Uniform variation is amplified by 20th century external forcing, while a global warming–induced strengthening of the monsoon seeds the east-west contrast. This contrast is deepened by a mid-21st century transition to a North Atlantic cooling relative to the global tropical oceans, which affects the western Sahel most strongly because it is immediately adjacent to the North Atlantic, leading to a divergence in outcomes—between a progressively wetter central and eastern Sahel and an abruptly drier western Sahel—that is unparalleled in instrumental observations."
