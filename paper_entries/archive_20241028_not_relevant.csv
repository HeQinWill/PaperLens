Herein, we coupled bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging with high-throughput fluorescence-activated single-cell sorting (FACS) and sequencing to characterize the phenome and genome of active ARB in complex environmental matrices. Active ARB, conferring resistance to six antibiotics throughout wastewater treatment, were distinguished and quantified. The percentage and concentration of active ARB ranged from 0.28% to 45.3% and from 1.1 × 104 to 2.09 × 107 cells/mL, respectively. Notably, the final effluents retained up to 4.79 × 104 cells/mL of active ARB. Targeted FACS and genomic sequencing revealed a distinct taxonomic composition of active ARB compared with that of the overall population. The coexistence of antibiotic resistome and mobilome in active ARB was also identified, including three high-quality metagenomic assembly genomes assigned to pathogenic bacteria, highlighting the substantial health risks due to their activity, phenotypic resistance, mobility, and pathogenicity. This study advances our understanding of previously overlooked active ARB in the environment by linking their resistance phenotype to their genotype. This high-throughput method will enable efficient quantitative surveillance of active AMR, providing valuable insights into risk control and management."

Proposed models for the formation of the NAA include a remnant high‐temperature feature resulting from the passage of the Great Meteor Hotspot, edge‐driven convection, and ongoing asthenospheric upwelling. We investigate the structure of the lithosphere above the central portion of the NAA using data from the New England Seismic Transects (NEST) experiment. Ps receiver functions reveal two consistent interfaces beneath the dense northern line of NEST: the Moho (the base of the crust) and a deeper negative velocity gradient (NVG) feature located at depths between 60 and 110 km. We consider several potential explanations for this NVG feature; based on comparisons with previous results, we propose that it likely corresponds to the lithosphere‐asthenosphere boundary. Our results indicate that the lithosphere beneath New England is nonuniform and has likely been thinned."

Results show the estimated entrainment rates increase with increasing resolution, and the growth rate is roughly power‐law related to resolution. However, all commonly used parameterizations except for the buoyancy sorting scheme fail to reproduce the monotonic increase of entrainment with resolution, but rather a slight decrease instead. For these schemes, it is suggested the power‐law fitting formula derived from LES/CRM simulations can be used as a scaling function for high‐resolution entrainment correction. Preliminary tests show that the application of entrainment scaling largely reduces the parcel buoyancy and thus the convective available potential energy, favoring the reduction of parameterized convection at high resolution."

To accommodate agricultural production under multiple scenarios of future climate and land‐use change, this study proposes a “simulation–optimization” modeling approach based on a crop growth model with a synergistic “carbon emission–economic benefit” approach. This approach is based on climate change conditions and it accurately simulates future land use changes and crop growth processes, establishes a carbon emission intensity optimization model, and generates a spatial planting structure optimization and regulation scheme based on intelligent optimization algorithms under changing scenarios. The results of the model application show that the planting structure option in the future scenario can increase economic benefit by up to 14.8% compared to the current scenario while simultaneously reducing total greenhouse gas emissions by 6.77%. Correlation analysis of planting area, irrigation water volume, carbon intensity value and unilateral water use efficiency can be used to obtain the coordination level of each county under different regulation scenarios. This “simulation–optimization” modeling approach provides an effective approach to achieve synergistic and coordinated development of regional agricultural benefits and carbon reduction by fine‐tuning the planting structure, which promotes low‐carbon and high‐quality development of regional agriculture."

We analyzed dengue incidence trends and the relationship between annual mean minimum temperatures (AMMTs) and dengue incidence rates from 1990 to 2019 in 122 countries using the Global Burden of Disease and TerraClimate data sets. We also projected global dengue incidence rates under different carbon emission scenarios using temperature data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) data set. Our results reveal a significant increase in global dengue cases from 1990 to 2019 and a positive correlation between temperature and dengue incidence. The association between AMMT and dengue incidence strengthened at temperatures exceeding 21°C. Central and eastern sub‐Saharan Africa, as well as Oceania, were identified as the regions most sensitive to dengue; males and individuals aged 15–19 or 70–84 years were the most susceptible to dengue under rising temperatures. Our projections suggest that global dengue incidence will substantially increase by 2050 and 2100. By 2100, regions including Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the southern United States, southern China, and island countries in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are projected to become year‐round dengue‐endemic under a high‐emission climate scenario. Our findings underscore the importance of implementing effective measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on dengue transmission. Identifying high‐risk areas and susceptible populations, along with understanding the projected expansion of dengue‐endemic regions, will provide valuable guidance for targeted interventions to address this growing global health challenge in the face of changing climatic conditions."

 Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can be associated with neurological deficits and has profound consequences for mortality and morbidity. Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) and delayed cerebral ischemia affect neurological outcomes in SAH patients, but their mechanisms are not fully understood, and effective treatments are limited. Here, we report that urotensin II receptor UT plays a pivotal role in both early events and delayed mechanisms following SAH in male mice. Few days post-SAH, UT expression is triggered by blood or hemoglobin in the leptomeningeal compartment. UT contributes to perimeningeal glia limitans astrocyte reactivity, microvascular alterations and neuroinflammation independent of CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs). Later, CAM-dependent vascular inflammation and subsequent CVS develop, leading to cognitive dysfunction. In an SAH model using humanized UTh+/h+ male mice, we show that post-SAH CVS and behavioral deficits, mediated by UT through Gq/PLC/Ca2+ signaling, are prevented by UT antagonists. These results highlight the potential of targeting UT pathways to reduce early meningeal response and delayed cerebral ischemia in SAH patients. “In subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), therapies are limited and clinical outcomes remain disappointing.

This paper develops six environmental footprint indices highlighting the synergies with human production and the SDG targets. 
 Human economic activities drive the production and consumption of goods and services, contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the extent of economic growth’s influence on the SDGs remains unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, here, we quantified the environmental effects of economic activities and explored correlations between environmental effect and achieving SDGs. We developed six Environmental Footprint Indices, with a higher score indicating better efficiency or lower burden. Here we show that the various Environmental Footprint Indices had synergistic and trade-off effects on most SDG targets indices, but the synergistic effects prevailed. As income increased, the correlation between Environmental Footprint Indices and SDG target indices gradually strengthened. improved production efficiency and consumption changes notably advance SDGs, especially in low-income group countries. Our work provides scientific insights into the impact and prospects of environmental regulation required for achieving the SDGs by 2030. Economic development and its interactions with the SDGs is an important focus for sustainable future growth.

 All-insulator heterostructures with an emerging metallicity are at the forefront of material science, which typically contain at least one band insulator while it is not necessary to be. Here we show emergent phenomena in a series of all-correlated-insulator heterostructures that composed of insulating CaIrO3 and insulating La0.67Sr0.33MnO3. We observed an intriguing insulator-to-metal transition, that depends delicately on the thickness of the iridate component. The simultaneous enhancements of magnetization, electric conductivity, and magnetoresistance effect indicate a percolation-type nature of the insulator-to-metal transition, with the percolation threshold can be reached at an exceptionally low volume fraction of the iridate. Such a drastic transition is induced by an interfacial charge transfer, which interestingly alters the electronic and crystalline structures of the bulk region rather than the limited ultrathin interface. We further showcased the central role of effective correlation in modulating the insulator-to-metal transition, by demonstrating that the critical thickness of iridate for triggering the metallic state can be systematically reduced down to a single unit-cell layer.

Here the authors show that, in fibroblasts, ASPP1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of p53, decreasing myofibroblast activity and improving cardiac fibrosis and function after myocardial infarction. 
 In the healing process of myocardial infarction, cardiac fibroblasts are activated to produce collagen, leading to adverse remodeling and heart failure. Our previous study showed that ASPP1 promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis by enhancing the nuclear trafficking of p53. We thus explored the influence of ASPP1 on myocardial fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms. Here, we observed that ASPP1 was increased after 4 weeks of MI. Both global and myofibroblast knockout of ASPP1 in mice mitigated cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis after MI. Strikingly, ASPP1 produced the opposite influence on p53 level and cell fate in cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Knockdown of ASPP1 increased p53 levels and inhibited the activity of cardiac fibroblasts. ASPP1 accumulated in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts while the level of p53 was reduced following TGF-β1 stimulation; however, inhibition of ASPP1 increased the p53 level and promoted p53 nuclear translocation. Mechanistically, ASPP1 is directly bound to deubiquitinase OTUB1, thereby promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of p53, attenuating myofibroblast activity and cardiac fibrosis, and improving heart function after MI.

 Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota are pivotal symptoms for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its associated complications, such as intestinal fibrosis. This research introduces a probiotic inulin hydrogel loaded with polypyrrole (PPy) nanozymes and antifibrotic drug pirfenidone (PFD) (PPy/PFD@Inulin gel) designed for the concurrent amelioration of IBD and its fibrotic complication. Upon oral administration, the inulin gel matrix could extend the gastrointestinal residence time of PPy nanozymes and PFD, facilitating the efficient reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and enhancement of the intestinal epithelial barrier repair as well as the suppression of intestinal fibrosis through sustained RONS scavenging, modulation of gut microbiota and attenuation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway to inhibit fibroblast proliferation. Notably, the PPy/PFD@Inulin gel demonstrated significant prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in acute and chronic colitis as well as intestinal fibrosis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in mouse models. Thus, the engineered ternary PPy/PFD@Inulin gel offered a pioneered paradigm for simultaneous reversal of IBD and its associated complications, such as intestinal fibrosis, in a single therapeutic regimen.

 Neuronal hyperexcitability is a key element of many neurodegenerative disorders including the motor neuron disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), where it occurs associated with elevated late sodium current (INaL). INaL results from incomplete inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) after their opening and shapes physiological membrane excitability. However, dysfunctional increases can cause hyperexcitability-associated diseases. Here we reveal the atypical binding mechanism which explains how the neuroprotective ALS-treatment drug riluzole stabilises VGSCs in their inactivated state to cause the suppression of INaL that leads to reversed cellular overexcitability. Riluzole accumulates in the membrane and enters VGSCs through openings to their membrane-accessible fenestrations. Riluzole binds within these fenestrations to stabilise the inactivated channel state, allowing for the selective allosteric inhibition of INaL without the physical block of Na+ conduction associated with traditional channel pore binding VGSC drugs. We further demonstrate that riluzole can reproduce these effects on a disease variant of the non-neuronal VGSC isoform Nav1.4, where pathologically increased INaL is caused directly by mutation. Overall, we identify a model for VGSC inhibition that produces effects consistent with the inhibitory action of riluzole observed in models of ALS. Our findings will aid future drug design and supports research directed towards riluzole repurposing. The authors here present a high-resolution structure of riluzole bound to a voltage-gated sodium channel.

 There is debate about the use of wetlands as natural climate solutions due to their ability to act as a “double-edged sword” with respect to climate impacts by both sequestering CO2 while emitting CH4. Here, we used a process-based greenhouse gas (GHG) perturbation model to simulate wetland radiative forcing and temperature change associated with wetland state conversion over 500 years based on empirical carbon flux measurements, and CO2-equivalent (CO2-e.q.) metrics to assess the net flux of GHGs from wetlands on a comparable basis. Three CO2-e.q. metrics were used to describe the relative radiative impact of CO2 and CH4—the conventional global warming potential (GWP) that looks at pulse GHG emissions over a fixed timeframe, the sustained-flux GWP (SGWP) that looks at sustained GHG emissions over a fixed timeframe, and GWP* that explicitly accounts for changes in the radiative forcing of CH4 over time (initially more potent but then diminishing after about a decade)—against model-derived mean temperature profiles. GWP* most closely estimated the mean temperature profiles associated with net wetland GHG emissions. Using the GWP*, intact wetlands serve as net CO2-e.q. carbon sinks and deliver net cooling effects on the climate. Prioritizing the conservation of intact wetlands is a cost-effective approach with immediate climate benefits that align with the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change timeline of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Restoration of wetlands also has immediate climate benefits (reduced warming), but with the majority of climate benefits (cooling) occurring over longer timescales, making it an effective short and long-term natural climate solution with additional co-benefits."

Nitrogen deposition contributed directly to 9.0% of global forest soil nitrous oxide emissions. The derived country-specific sensitivities of soil nitrous oxide emission to nitrogen deposition could be employed as localized emission factors for forestland nitrous oxide emission inventories. This study sheds light on a process-augmented data-driven approach to estimating global nitrous oxide emissions by synthesizing experimental and observational data. From 1985 to 2015, nitrous oxide emissions from forest soils increased globally, and nitrogen deposition contributed directly to nine percent of forest soil nitrous oxide emissions, according to a combined analysis of observations and experiments on nitrogen additions."

 Aquaculture is a major emission source of atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, its contribution remains highly uncertain because the source has been neglected in global and national greenhouse gas inventories. Here, we present an inventory of CH4 and N2O fluxes from five freshwater aquaculture systems in China, which accounted for more than half of global freshwater aquaculture production during 2000-2020. We show that total CH4 and N2O emissions were 2.5 (0.6-4.2) Tg CH4 yr-1 and 18.3 (3.8-32.2) Gg N2O yr-1, respectively, with 75% coming from ponds and paddy fields. CH4 and N2O effluxes from freshwater aquaculture were 5 and 2 times higher than the average from other inland water bodies, respectively. Aquaculture accounts for half of the national inland water emissions, and outweighs the land soil methane sink. We suggest that tracking aquacultural emissions and their reduction through aerated systems could provide additional opportunity to reduce agricultural non-CO2 emissions without compromising food security. Freshwater aquaculture may contribute as much as half of all freshwater greenhouse gas emissions in China and could scale as the industry grows, according to a synthesis of methane and nitrous oxide emission observations across China from 1980-2022."

 Exploring molecular biomarkers in lava tube speleothems offers insights into environmental dynamics, biogeochemical processes, and subsurface life, with implications for astrobiology, particularly in Martian analog environments. Despite extensive biomarker research in marine and terrestrial settings, lava tube studies are limited. This study employed molecular, isotope and mineralogical characterization to analyze sulfate speleothems from six lava tubes of Lanzarote (Canary Islands), considered analog for the Moon and Mars. The combination of mass spectrometry, thermogravimetry, and mineralogical techniques, revealed geological processes, biomarkers and their biological sources. The identified minerals were primarily calcium and sodium sulfates. Sulfur isotope analyses indicated volcanic and oceanic origins, while carbon isotope composition and pyrolysis analyses suggested influences from vegetation and microbial activity. Lipidic profiles highlighted branched and n-alkanes, as well as palmitic and stearic acid methyl esters, suggesting microbial origins. These findings contribute to understanding geological and environmental dynamics in lava tubes and recognizing potential biosignatures on Earth and other planets.

 Stressors endanger lake ecosystem biodiversity and networks, especially in sandy lakes of arid/semiarid regions, where impacts are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the changes in multitrophic biodiversity and ecological networks under increasing stress (temperature, nutrients, lake area) by using sedimentary DNA from a shrinking sandy lake in China over nearly 100 years. With increasing stress, species richness and stability increased, whereas species turnover decreased. Species synchronism decreased at high-trophic levels but increased at low-trophic levels. Empirical dynamic modeling showed network connectance and strength of species interactions decreased–increased–decreased over time, signaling a potential adaption–resistance–degradation change in ecosystem responses with increasing stress. Models also indicated network structure primarily depended on direct effects of nutrients and temperature under low/medium stress and on a diversity-mediated pathway under high stress. Thus, maintaining ecological network structure complexity and integrity in lake ecosystems is essential to mitigate the effects of multiple stresses. Biodiversity at several trophic levels in a shrinking sandy lake in China increased at times of stress over the past 100 years, while species turnover decreased, and network connectivity went down, then up and down again, according to analyses of sedimentary DNA."

 Deep learning enhances earthquake monitoring capabilities by mining seismic waveforms directly. However, current neural networks, trained within specific areas, face challenges in generalizing to diverse regions. Here, we employ a data recombination method to create generalized earthquakes occurring at any location with arbitrary station distributions for neural network training. The trained models can then be applied universally with different monitoring setups for earthquake detection and parameter evaluation from continuous seismic waveform streams. This allows real-time Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) to be initiated at the very early stages of an occurring earthquake. When applied to substantial earthquake sequences across Japan and California (US), our models reliably report most earthquake locations and magnitudes within 4 seconds of the initial P-wave arrival, with mean errors of 2.6-7.3 km and 0.05-0.32, respectively. The generalized neural networks facilitate global applications of real-time EEW, eliminating complex empirical configurations typically required by traditional methods.

 Tropical cyclone-induced storm surge is a major coastal risk, which will be further amplified by rising sea levels under global warming. Here, we present a computational efficient, globally applicable modeling approach in which ocean surge and coastal inundation dynamics are modeled in a single step by the open-source solver GeoClaw. We compare our approach to two state-of-the-art, globally applicable approaches: (i) using a static inundation model to translate coastal water level time series from a full-scale physical ocean dynamics into inundated areas, and (ii) a fully static approach directly mapping wind fields to inundation areas. For a global set of 71 storms, we compare the modeled flooded areas to satellite-based floodplain observations. We find that, overall, the models have only moderate skill in reproducing the observed floodplains. GeoClaw performs better than the two other modeling approaches that lack a process-based representation of inundation dynamics. The computational efficiency of the presented approach opens up new perspectives for global assessments of coastal risks from tropical cyclones. Accounting for inundation processes dynamically improves the modeling of tropical cyclone-induced coastal flooding compared to state-of-the-art, globally applicable approaches using static bathtub-type inundation models."

 Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) is a forest infectious disease that inflicts substantial economic losses to China’s forestry. Its rapid spread and the significant challenges associated with its control make early detection of infected trees crucial for disaster prevention. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technologies provide high-resolution spectral diagnostic information coupled with intricate three-dimensional structural data, which has potential for fine grained monitoring of PWD. However, how to fuse HSI and LiDAR data to identify the early infected individual trees is still a challenge. This study presents a novel instance segmentation network, BH3DNet, to identify individual trees at different PWD-infected stages by extracting high-level abstract features based on the fusion of drone HSI and LiDAR data. BH3DNet introduces the PointNet++ model as the base network, and incorporates a shared encoder and twin parallel decoders to align semantic category prediction and instance segmentation of individual trees in an end-to-end approach. By applying an enhanced point cloud dataset that fuses drone HSI and LiDAR point cloud data, this model facilitates the identification of PWD infection stages at the individual tree scale. We evaluated the proposed model in a Masson pine forest stand sparsely mixed with broadleaf trees in a variety of infection states ranging from healthy to severely infected by PWD, and compared the performance of the model using the RGB bands, full HSI bands and screened bands as inputs, respectively. BH3DNet achieves an overall accuracy of 89.65 % with a Kappa × 100 of 87.29 for identifying individual trees using screened HSI bands and LiDAR point cloud, significantly outperforming the Mask R-CNN using only HSI data (overall accuracy: 70.81 %, Kappa × 100: 64.16). Moreover, BH3DNet’s accuracy at the early infection stage reaches 83.75 %. It proves that fusing HSI and point cloud data reflects the information of individual trees distribution and infection status, and the BH3DNet is suitable for high-precision monitoring of PWD."

Pihl Karlsson;P.E. Karlsson;S. Hellsten;H. Danielsson;V. Kronnäs;C. Akselsson,Total deposition of sulphur to coniferous forests in Sweden - Taking canopy exchange into account,"•Dry deposition of S to coniferous forests was estimated with surrogate surfaces and wet deposition of S was estimated from bulk deposition. •The deposition of S that was measured in throughfall was lower than the estimated total dry and wet deposition of S. •The canopy uptake of S to coniferous forests in Sweden was estimated to 0.1-0.8 kg S ha−1yr−1and was highest during summer. 
 In the low deposition situation of today at many of the long-term Swedish forest monitoring sites, the deposition measured as precipitation to the open field, i.e. bulk deposition of oxidized sulphur (S) is often higher or equal to deposition of S sampled under the forest canopies, i.e. as throughfall. This suggests that the total S deposition estimated using throughfall is underestimated. The reason for this is direct exchange of S with the forest canopies, leading to an underestimation which becomes evident in low-deposition areas. We describe a new method to estimate the dry deposition of S to coniferous forest based on measurements with Teflon string samplers as surrogate surfaces, in combination with measurements of the net throughfall for sodium (throughfall subtracted with wet deposition). The wet deposition was estimated from bulk deposition measurements on the open field, corrected for dry deposition to the collectors. The method was applied for Norway spruce forests at monitoring sites across Sweden during nine years 2014–2022, and total deposition was calculated based on wet deposition and the estimated dry deposition. The estimated annual total deposition of S as a mean value for coniferous forests ranged between 0.8 and 5.2 kg S ha−1 yr−1 with lowest values in northern Sweden and highest in southwest Sweden. The share of dry deposition of the total S deposition was between 20 and 53%. The mean annual deposition of S measured as throughfall during 2014–2022 for three different regions in Sweden was between 16 and 41% lower compared to the corresponding total deposition estimated with the new method. The canopy exchange of S was analyzed on a monthly basis as the difference between the estimated total deposition and the measured throughfall deposition of S. At most sites, there was a canopy uptake of S during the summer months and a leakage of S during the winter months. This indicates that the canopy exchange of S is a phenomenon that involves some biological activity."

This study aims to enhance the potential of breathomics in various frontiers by categorizing exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as endogenous or exogenous. Analyzing ambient air and breath samples from 271 volunteers via TD-GC × GC-TOF MS/FID, we identify and quantify 50 common VOCs in exhaled breath. Advanced quantitative structure–property relationships and compartment models are employed to obtain VOCs kinetic parameters. This in-depth approach allows us to accurately determine the alveolar concentration of VOCs and further discern their origins, facilitating personalized application of breathomics in exposure assessment and disease diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate that prolonged external exposure turns humans into secondary pollutant sources. Analysis of endogenous VOCs reveals that internal exposure poses more significant health risks than external. Moreover, by correcting environmental backgrounds, we improve the accuracy of gastrointestinal disease diagnostic models by 15–25%. This advancement in identifying VOC origins via compartmental models promises to elevate the clinical relevance of breathomics, marking a leap forward in exposure assessment and precision medicine."

Drawing from natural sediment research provides valuable insights to address this knowledge gap. One key dimensionless number used to describe sediment transport is the transport stage, referring to the ratio between the flow shear velocity and the particle settling velocity. However, variations in physical properties, such as shape and density, raise concerns about the applicability of existing sediment transport theories to microplastics. To address this challenge, we employed a physical modeling approach, examining 24 different nonbuoyant microplastic particles in a turbulent open channel flow. Utilizing 3D particle tracking, a total of 720 trajectories were recorded and analyzed. Microplastic particles exhibited transport modes akin to natural sediments, including rolling/sliding, saltation, and suspension. The transport stage strongly correlated with these modes, as well as with the mean forward velocity and mean position in the water column. Notably, particle shape emerged as a critical factor influencing transport dynamics. Due to their lower settling velocity, fibers tended to stay closer to the water surface with lower forward velocities compared to spheres. Based on the laboratory results, a new phase diagram for microplastics is introduced analogous to an existing diagram for sediments."

We conducted physical experiments, using homogeneous erodible rock simulants, to study notch‐forming mechanisms under periodic sediment‐laden bore impacts. Our findings reveal shifts in the temporal dynamics of notch development. Initially, swash uprush and vortex formation contribute to a positive feedback loop that creates a shallow and wide notch. Subsequently, upward erosion ceases, and notch backwear and downwear are dominated by the vortex. Eventually, sediment deposition armors the notch floor; this negative feedback loop reduces erosion. The sediment size determines the amount of erosion, with a range of grain sizes generating maximum erosion. This indicates a dependence on the momentum of the sediment particles entrained within the bore. This research reveals fundamental notch formation mechanisms driven by swash abrasion."

The bias is present in the southern Cascadia region (i.e., Pacific Northwestern United States and southwestern British Columbia, Canada, spanning from the coast to the Rocky Mountains), with some models showing a bias magnitude in excess of −10°C in the first percentile of daily winter minimum temperature. The sea level pressure pattern for these events is similar in CMIP6 models and ERA5, showing high anomalies in the Northeast Pacific that are indicative of an atmospheric blocking pattern and consequently more northerly flow. Though this atmospheric blocking pattern is typically concurrent with cold winter temperatures across much of North America, Rocky and Cascade mountain ranges prevent the cold air from reaching the southern Cascadia region as confirmed by the observations and reanalysis. Our results suggest that the bias in CMIP6 minimum temperatures is a result of unresolved topography in the Rockies and Cascade mountain ranges, such that the terrain does not adequately block cold air advection from reaching the southern Cascadia region."

We create such an analytical framework, then use it to assess the robustness of alternative pathways to achieving 60% emissions reductions from 2022 levels by 2040 for the Western U.S. power system. Our framework integrates power system planning and resource adequacy models with 100 climate realizations from a large climate ensemble. Climate realizations drive electricity demand; thermal plant availability; and wind, solar, and hydropower generation. Among five initial decarbonization pathways, all exhibit modest to significant resource adequacy failures under climate realizations in 2040, but certain pathways experience significantly less resource adequacy failures at little additional cost relative to other pathways. By identifying and planning for an extreme climate realization that drives the largest resource adequacy failures across our pathways, we produce a new decarbonization pathway that has no resource adequacy failures under any climate realizations. This new pathway is roughly 5% more expensive than other pathways due to greater capacity investment, and shifts investment from wind to solar and natural gas generators. Our analysis suggests modest increases in investment costs can add significant robustness against climate change in decarbonizing power systems. Our framework can help power system planners adapt to climate change by stress testing future plans to potential climate realizations, and offers a unique bridge between energy system and climate modeling."

Here, authors report an electrolyte additive which promotes the formation of a bilayer solid electrolyte interphase, increasing the efficiency and utilization of zinc plating and stripping. 
 Construction of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) of zinc (Zn) electrode is an effective strategy to stabilize Zn electrode/electrolyte interface. However, single-layer SEIs of Zn electrodes undergo rupture and consequent failure during repeated Zn plating/stripping. Here, we propose the construction of a robust bilayer SEI that simultaneously achieves homogeneous Zn2+ transport and durable mechanical stability for high Zn utilization rate (ZUR) and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Zn electrode by adding 1,3-Dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone as a representative electrolyte additive. This bilayer SEI on Zn surface consists of a crystalline ZnCO3-rich outer layer and an amorphous ZnS-rich inner layer. The ordered outer layer improves the mechanical stability during cycling, and the amorphous inner layer homogenizes Zn2+ transport for homogeneous, dense Zn deposition. As a result, the bilayer SEI enables reversible Zn plating/stripping for 4800 cycles with an average CE of 99.95% (± 0.06%). Meanwhile, Zn | |Zn symmetric cells show durable lifetime for over 550 h with a high ZUR of 98% under an areal capacity of 28.4 mAh cm−2. Furthermore, the Zn full cells based on the bilayer SEI functionalized Zn negative electrodes coupled with different positive electrodes all exhibit stable cycling performance under high ZUR.

 The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) phosphorylates a subset of RAB GTPases, and their phosphorylation levels are elevated by Parkinson’s disease (PD)-linked mutations of LRRK2. However, the precise function of the LRRK2-regulated RAB GTPase in the brain remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify RAB12 as a robust LRRK2 substrate in the mouse brain through phosphoproteomics profiling and solve the structure of RAB12-LRRK2 protein complex through Cryo-EM analysis. Mechanistically, RAB12 cooperates with LRRK2 to inhibit primary ciliogenesis and regulate centrosome homeostasis in astrocytes through enhancing the phosphorylation of RAB10 and recruiting RILPL1, while the functions of RAB12 require a direct interaction with LRRK2 and LRRK2 activity. Furthermore, the ciliary and centrosome defects caused by the PD-linked LRRK2-G2019S mutation are prevented by Rab12 deletion in astrocytes. Thus, our study reveals a physiological function of the RAB12-LRRK2 complex in regulating ciliogenesis and centrosome homeostasis.

 Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis in the hypothalamus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and type 2 diabetes; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remain vague and debatable. Here we report that SEL1L-HRD1 protein complex of the highly conserved ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) machinery in POMC-expressing neurons ameliorates diet-induced obesity and its associated complications, partly by regulating the turnover of the long isoform of Leptin receptors (LepRb). Loss of SEL1L in POMC-expressing neurons attenuates leptin signaling and predisposes mice to HFD-associated pathologies including fatty liver, glucose intolerance, insulin and leptin resistance. Mechanistically, nascent LepRb, both wildtype and disease-associated Cys604Ser variant, are misfolding prone and bona fide substrates of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD. In the absence of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, LepRb are largely retained in the ER, in an ER stress-independent manner. This study uncovers an important role of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in the pathogenesis of central leptin resistance and leptin signaling. The importance of protein degradation in the ER during leptin signaling has been unclear. Here, the authors show that SEL1L-HRD1 ER-associated degradation modulates leptin signaling in POMC neurons by degrading misfolded leptin receptors in the ER."

 Mid-ocean ridges are unique, tectonically active geographical units on Earth that profoundly control the ocean environment and dynamics at the global scale. However, high-resolution topographic data from mid-ocean ridges are rarely available due to the difficulty in detecting ocean floors, which further limits ocean research at the global scale. Here, we divide the global mid-ocean ridge system into 2805 tiles and reconstruct their high-resolution topography by using a transfer learning approach with freely available low-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and limited high-resolution DEMs. A high-frequency terrain feature-based deep residual network is proposed to generate high-resolution global mid-ocean ridge DEMs. In this network, topographic knowledge related to mid-ocean ridges is integrated and quantified to improve the learning efficiency and reconstruction quality of the network. A series of verifications and evaluations demonstrate the reliability of reconstructed topographies for submarine topography research. We observe that reconstructed topography can achieve good environmental understanding and information acquisition in the global mid-ocean ridge range. We find that the complexity of the previous terrain environment is underestimated by 26.63% in terms of the slope gradient and by 14.95% in terms of terrain relief, while a 101.10% information improvement can be obtained for the reconstructed topography. The reconstructed topography indicates that diverse and intricate topographical environments of mid-ocean ridges exist among different ocean regions. The proposed transfer learning method for reconstructing high-resolution mid-ocean ridge topographies is valuable and can be utilized for reconstructing information in regions that are difficult to observe directly and lack sufficient data."

 Initial and model uncertainties are the main sources of forecast errors, making the single and deterministic forecasts unreliable. To estimate these uncertainties, a growing consensus shifts towards ensemble forecasting, aiming to provide the probability density distribution of the atmosphere. However, current ensemble methods either focus on single-source uncertainties or employ a simple superposition of the two, neglecting the nonlinear interaction between them, and thus fail to reflect the real forecast uncertainty. Motivated by this, this study extends the CNOP approach, defined as the optimal growth considering nonlinear interaction between initial and model parameters, to the scenario of ensemble forecasts and proposes an orthogonal CNOPs method (O-CNOP-IPs). This method concerns the nonlinear effect of initial and model parametric uncertainties through a joint optimization strategy and enhances the estimation of this effect by providing diversity and independent CNOPs (via orthogonality). To evaluate the performance of O-CNOP-IPs, extensive experiments are conducted for North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) ensemble forecasts in the realistically configured Community Earth System Model (CESM). Our findings reveal that the O-CNOP-IPs method outperforms existing methods in forecast skill and reliability, improving deterministic skill by 17.5 % and probabilistic skill by 52 %–63 %. Our dynamic analysis also unveils that this method undergoes rapid development in the early stage and effectively neutralizes errors in control forecasts, significantly enhancing the reliability of ensemble forecasts. It is expected that O-CNOP-IPs plays a significant role in accurately representing the forecast uncertainty of other high-impact weather and climate phenomena."

The average classification accuracy on the validation set exceeded 85 %, and the R² values for linear fitting with existing statistical data all surpassed 0.9, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed mapping method. 
 In recent years, the demand for rice in Africa has been growing rapidly, and in order to meet this demand, the rice cultivation area is also expanding rapidly, thus it is of great significance to monitor the rice cultivation in Africa. The spatial and temporal distribution of rice cultivation in Africa is complex, making it difficult to use a climate-based rice identification method, and the existing rice distribution products are all grid based statistical data with low resolution, unable to obtain accurate rice field location and available labels. To address these two difficulties, based on time-series optical and dual-polarisation SAR data, this study proposes a sample set construction method by fast coarse positioning assisted visual interpretation, and a feature importance guided supervised classification combining multiple temporal optical and SAR features to reduce the impact of rice diversity in Africa. Firstly, we use the time-series statistical features of VH data for fast coarse positioning and screening of possible rice areas, and combine multiple auxiliary data for visual interpretation to make sample set; secondly, based on the complementary information in SAR data and optical data, the 20 meter Africa rice distribution map of 2023 was completed by combining the object-oriented segmentation results of temporal optical images and the pixel based classification results of temporal SAR data features after feature selection. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method on the validation set is more than 85 %, and the R2 of the linear fit to various existing statistical data is more than 0.9, which proves that the proposed method can achieve the spatial distribution mapping of rice under the complex climatic conditions in a large region, providing crucial data support for rice monitoring and agricultural policy development.

Additionally, we discussed the applicability of landslide dam stability and peak discharge models to DFBDs. This dataset offers a rich foundation of data for future studies on DFBDs. 
 Debris flows, as a special kind of landslides, often block rivers to form barrier dams and trigger a series of disasters such as upstream aggradation and outburst floods. The understanding of debris-flow barrier dams (DFBDs) is poor, mostly due to existing researches focusing on individual events and a lack of summarization of multiple DFBD events. The existing global or regional datasets of landslide barrier dams (LDs) contain only a few cases of DFBDs, and ignore the differences between DFBDs and other landslide barrier dams (LDs), such as the dams of rock slide, debris avalanche, or earth slide. To fill this gap, we reviewed 2519 literatures and media reports with high quality. Focusing on identified debris-flow damming events, a rigorous data review and validation process was conducted using Google Earth. A systematic approach was employed to prioritize conflicting information from various data sources. Consequently, a global dataset was compiled, encompassing 555 historical DFBDs from 1800 to 2023."

Elevated detection frequencies of VC degradation biomarker genes were measured immediately downstream of the accident site (i.e., Sulphur Run). Aerobic VC degradation occurred in all sediment microcosms and coincided with increases of etnC/etnE genes and Mycobacterium, a genus comprising aerobic VC degraders. The conversion of VC to ethene and an increased abundance of VC reductive dechlorination biomarker genes were observed in microcosms established with sediments collected from Sulphur Run. All anoxic microcosms rapidly degraded BA to innocuous products with  intermediate formation of n-butanol and acrylate. The results indicate that microbiomes in the East Palestine watershed have natural attenuation capacity for VC and BA.

This study investigated the in vitro toxicological characteristics of PM2.5 emissions from residential biomass pellet burning using the A549 epithelial cell line. The potential of modern pellet applications to reduce PM2.5 emissions was evaluated by considering both mass reduction and toxicity modification. PM2.5 emissions from raw and pelletized biomass combustion reduced cell viability, indicative of acute toxicity, and also protein expression associated with epithelial barrier integrity, implying further systemic toxicity, potentially via an oxidative stress mechanism. Toxicity varied between PM2.5 emissions from raw biomass and pellets, with pelletized straw and wood inducing cytotoxicity by factors of 0.54 and 1.30, and causing epithelial barrier damage by factors of 1.76 and 2.08, respectively, compared to their raw counterparts.

In this study, six strains of ORB were screened from a water reclamation plant in Beijing. Three of them (O7, CR19, and O4) were more resistant to ozone than all previously reported ORB or even spores. The ozone consumption capacity of extracellular polymeric substances and cell walls was proved to be the main sources of bacterial ozone resistance, rather than intracellular antioxidant enzymes.

This complexity requires WBGT to be calculated iteratively following the recommended approach developed by Liljegren and colleagues. The need for iteration has limited the wide application of Liljegren's approach, and stimulated various simplified WBGT approximations that do not require iteration but are potentially seriously biased. By carefully examining the self‐nonlinearities in Liljegren's model, we develop a zero‐iteration analytic approximation of WBGT while maintaining sufficient accuracy and the physical basis of the original model. The new approximation slightly deviates from Liljegren's full model—by less than 1°C in 99% cases over 93% of global land area. The annual mean and 75%–99% percentiles of WBGT are also well represented with biases within ±0.5 $\pm 0.5$°C globally. This approximation is clearly more accurate than other commonly used WBGT approximations. Physical intuition can be developed on the processes controlling WBGT variations from an energy balance perspective.

 The Himalayas, which host glaciers, modulate the Indian Monsoon and create an arid Tibetan Plateau, play a vital role in distributing freshwater resources to the world’s most populous regions. The Himalayas formed under prolonged crustal thickening and erosion by glaciers and rivers. Chomolungma (8,849 m)—also known as Mount Everest or Sagarmāthā—is higher than surrounding peaks, and GPS measurements suggest a higher uplift rate in recent years than the long-term trend. Here we analyse the potential contribution of a river capture event in the Kosi River drainage basin on the renewed surface uplift of Chomolungma. We numerically reconstruct the capture process using a simple stream power model combined with nonlinear inverse methods constrained by modern river profiles. Our best-fit model suggests the capture event occurred approximately 89 thousand years ago and caused acceleration of downstream incision rates. Flexural models estimate this non-steady erosion triggers isostatic response and surface uplift over a broad geographical area. We suggest that part of Chomolungma’s anomalous elevation (~15–50 m) can be explained as the isostatic response to capture-triggered river incision, highlighting the complex interplay between geological dynamics and the formation of topographic features.

 In the event of insufficient mitigation efforts, net-negative CO2 emissions may be required to return climate warming to acceptable limits as defined by the Paris Agreement. The ocean acts as an important carbon sink under increasing atmospheric CO2 levels when the physico-chemical uptake of carbon dominates. However, the processes that govern the marine carbon sink under net-negative CO2 emission regimes are unclear. Here we assessed changes in marine CO2 uptake and storage mechanisms under a range of idealized temperature-overshoot scenarios using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity over centennial timescales. We show that while the fate of CO2 from physico-chemical uptake is very sensitive to future atmospheric boundary conditions and CO2 is partly lost from the ocean at times of net-negative CO2 emissions, storage associated with the biological carbon pump continues to increase and may even dominate marine excess CO2 storage on multi-centennial timescales. Our findings imply that excess carbon that is attributable to the biological carbon pump needs to be considered carefully when quantifying and projecting changes in the marine carbon sink.

 Dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that has been associated with an imbalance towards the direct pathway between striatum and internal pallidum, but the neuronal underpinnings of this abnormal basal ganglia pathway activity remain unknown. Here, we report invasive recordings from ten dystonia patients via deep brain stimulation electrodes that allow for parallel recordings of several basal ganglia nuclei, namely the striatum, external and internal pallidum, that all displayed activity in the low frequency band (3–12 Hz). In addition to a correlation with low-frequency activity in the internal pallidum (R = 0.88, P = 0.001), we demonstrate that dystonic symptoms correlate specifically with low-frequency coupling between striatum and internal pallidum (R = 0.75, P = 0.009). This points towards a pathophysiological role of the direct striato-pallidal pathway in dystonia that is conveyed via coupling in the enhanced low-frequency band. Our study provides a mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of dystonia by revealing a link between symptom severity and frequency-specific coupling of distinct basal ganglia pathways.

 Methods are lacking that can prepare deuterium-enriched building blocks, in the full range of deuterium substitution patterns at the isotopic purity levels demanded by pharmaceutical use. To that end, this work explores the regio- and stereoselective deuteration of tetrahydropyridine (THP), which is an attractive target for study due to the wide prevalence of piperidines in drugs. A series of d0–d8 tetrahydropyridine isotopomers were synthesized by the stepwise treatment of a tungsten-complexed pyridinium salt with H−/D− and H+/D+. The resulting decomplexed THP isotopomers and isotopologues were analyzed via molecular rotational resonance (MRR) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique that distinguishes isotopomers and isotopologues by their unique moments of inertia. In order to demonstrate the medicinal relevance of this approach, eight unique deuterated isotopologues of erythro-methylphenidate were also prepared.

 The last decade has seen significant improvements in our understanding of skyrmions current induced dynamics, along with their room temperature stabilization, however, the impact of local material inhomogeneities still remains an issue that impedes reaching the regime of steady state motion of these spin textures. Here, we study the spin-torque driven motion of skyrmions in synthetic ferrimagnetic multilayers with the aim of achieving high mobility and reduced skyrmion Hall effect. We consider Pt|Co|Tb multilayers of various thicknesses with antiferromagnetic coupling between the Co and Tb magnetization. The increase of Tb thickness in the multilayers reduces the total magnetic moment and increases the spin-orbit torques allowing to reach velocities up to 400 ms−1 for skyrmions with diameters of about 160 nm. We demonstrate that due to reduced skyrmion Hall effect combined with the edge repulsion of the magnetic track, the skyrmions move along the track without any transverse deflection. Further, by comparing the field-induced domain wall motion and current-induced skyrmion motion, we demonstrate that the skyrmions at the largest current densities present all the characteristics of a dynamical flow regime.

 Wintertime atmospheric blocking often brings adverse environmental and socioeconomic impacts through its accompanying temperature and precipitation extremes. However, due to the chaotic nature of the extratropical atmospheric circulation and the challenges in simulating blocking, the skillful seasonal prediction of blocking remains elusive. In this study, we leverage both observational data and seasonal hindcasts from a state-of-the-art seasonal prediction system to investigate the prediction skill of North Pacific wintertime blocking frequency and its linkage to downstream cold extremes. The observational results show that North Pacific blocking has a local maximum over the central North Pacific Ocean and that the occurrence of North Pacific blocking drives significant cold anomalies over northwestern North America within a week, which are both well reproduced by the model. The model skillfully predicts the western North Pacific blocking frequency near the subtropical jet exit region at the shortest forecast lead, but skill drops off rapidly with lead time partly due to model drift in the background flow. To overcome this rapid drop in skill, we develop a linear hybrid dynamical-statistical model that uses the forecasted Niño 3.4 index and upstream precipitation as predictors and that maintains significant forecast skill of high-latitude North Pacific blocking up to 7 lead months in advance. Our results indicate that an improvement in the seasonal prediction skill of winter North Pacific blocking frequency may be achieved by the enhanced representation of the links among sea surface temperature anomalies, tropical convection, and the ensuing tropical-extratropical interaction that initiates North Pacific blocking."

 Planktonic mixotrophs, including ciliates, are abundant, yet understudied, mediators of primary and secondary production in aquatic food webs. Here, we report high-resolution in situ observations of a thin layer—a vertically limited patch of high organism abundance—of the ciliate, Laboea strobila. Within the thin layer, peak L. strobila abundances were as high as 62,000 cells/L, six times higher than previously reported, and were strongly positively correlated with co-measured chlorophyll a concentrations, indicating that the organism indulged in kleptoplasty, retaining plastids from ingested algae. Estimates indicated L. strobila contributed to ~63–78% of chlorophyll a within the layer, in sharp contrast to conventional expectations that phytoplankton dominate this signature, suggesting that mixotroph biomass, and consequently, their contribution to marine ecosystems is widely underestimated. These observations also highlight the importance of pairing traditional approaches such as chlorophyll a measurements with high-resolution imaging for proper attribution of biomass proxies.

 Projected changes in atmospheric blocking and associated extreme weather are marked by considerable uncertainties. While paleoclimate records could help reduce these uncertainties, their low temporal resolution makes extracting synoptic-scale signals challenging. Here, a deep learning model is developed to infer summertime blocking frequency from tree-ring-based gridded reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere surface temperature over the Last Millennium. The model, despite not directly incorporating paleoclimate proxies or their locations, is implicitly constrained by them. The reconstructions highlight the tropical Pacific’s strong influence on blocking variability at interannual-to-centennial time scales. A weakened tropical Pacific zonal temperature gradient during the Little Ice Age correlates with a hemispherically reduced -yet more variable interannually- blocking frequency and altered regional patterns. This deep learning approach offers a pathway for extracting paleoweather signals from paleoclimate records that enables improved understanding of blocking response to external forcing and constraining of model projections of blocking under climate change scenarios.

 Ongoing acquisition of Martian surface imagery constantly provides new opportunities to reveal previously undiscovered small-scale volcanic landforms, yielding critical insights into volcanic processes, and challenging existing inferences. Here, using the most recent, high-resolution topographical data, we mapped the accumulation of pyroclastic deposits occurring along the margins of several volcanic vents. They share morphological similarities with terrestrial volcanic deposits attributed to low-intensity lava fountaining occurring during mild explosive activity. Our identified, explosive volcanic deposits are associated with late Amazonian volcanic activity in Tharsis. The identification of these very recent (<100 Ma) deposits across the entire Tharsis volcanic province needs reconciling with our current view of the evolution of explosive volcanism on Mars.

 Global warming already influences precipitation, with more intense precipitation in many locations. Although the ‘wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier’ tendency in mean precipitation holds in many locations, the situations for precipitation extremes are more complex, due to changes in dynamic and thermodynamic influences on atmospheric moisture distributions. Here, we build a dynamically interactive atmospheric moisture model for the present (2006–2025) and the future climate (2081–2100), using outputs from coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. We find that the dynamic process of vertical advection of moisture dominates the same-day precipitation, while the smaller impact of the thermodynamic process provides available moisture for several days. As climate warms, we find that the dynamical-induced precipitation more completely exhausts the vertically-integrated moisture and the distribution of the dynamic process’s impact on precipitation exhibits a greater spread in the warmer future. The dynamical process is primarily responsible for more extreme heavy precipitation as climate warms, at all latitudes. Vertical moisture transport that is governed by atmospheric dynamics determines precipitation intensity on the same day, and exhausts the available moisture in the atmosphere more completely as the climate warms, according to an interactive atmospheric moisture model informed by climate model output."

 Carbonate mud is crucial in the global carbon cycle and serves as a key sedimentary archive for paleoclimate reconstruction. Understanding the mechanisms behind its formation is crucial for explaining long-term carbon storage, including atmospheric carbon dioxide transfer to the hydrosphere and variations in mud production over geological timescales. Various mechanisms explain carbonate mud formation in both lake and marine sediments. Using bio-physicochemical methods on deep sediments of Lake Ilay, Jura, France, we propose a model of micrite formation. Our study shows that micrite mineralization occurs in sediments due to the degradation of ooze rich in exopolymeric substances throughout the sediment core’s depth. This mineralization continues as long as exopolymeric substances are present, persisting for at least 2000 years. Cryo-Scanning electron microscope imaging reveals calcite nucleation at degraded exopolymeric substance nodes, advancing with substance degradation and calcium release. These findings provide insights into fossil carbonate mud origins and formation processes.

 Long-term series of high-resolution gridded precipitation datasets are essential for hydrological and meteorological research. Producing high-resolution precipitation data from regional models demands substantial computational resources and labor. Global Reanalyses offer long-term coverage and effectively capture annual and seasonal precipitation patterns. However, they have inadequate resolution and frequently have difficulties depicting extreme conditions. This study proposes an efficient and accurate approach for generating long-term series of high spatial and temporal resolution precipitation. It is achieved by leveraging deep learning techniques to integrate the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global climate reanalysis (ERA5, 0.25°, hourly) data with high-resolution precipitation fusion datasets. Considering the heavy-tailed distribution of precipitation, we developed the PreciDBPN model structure, which combines a classification network with a super-resolution network and incorporates physically relevant indices into the model's input. We trained and evaluated the PreciDBPN and baseline models in eastern China using the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) precipitation dataset (0.0625°, hourly, 2017–2022). When compared to baseline methods and ERA5, our model excels in multiple metrics and provides a more precise representation of relative rainfall frequency. Independent verification was performed using station observations during the period of 2010–2015 when CLDAS data were unavailable. During this verification, the PreciDBPN demonstrated exceptional performance and greater robustness compared to the baseline models. Because our method can efficiently downscale precipitation and bias-correct reanalysis data using minimal computational resources, it can be used to generate high-resolution precipitation datasets (0.0625°, hourly) from 1979 to 2022 while correcting for heavy precipitation underestimations in reanalysis data."

Yet, the threat of climate change—such as rising ocean temperatures—on mariculture performance remains uncertain. This is particularly true at small spatial scales relevant to most producers. Additionally, mariculture is often limited by regulations that impose restrictions on production, creating potential hurdles for anticipating and adapting to climate change. We focus on mariculture performance in the United States (U.S.), where state and federal policies and exposure to climate change vary substantially and likely interact. We map a current and future mariculture performance index by combining the first high resolution downscaled (0.083°) climate outputs for U.S. waters, species-specific physiological requirements, and policy restrictions. We find high current performance that will increase under warming oceans, with spatial variation that will amplify existing regional differences. Generally, performance will increase in the north and decrease in the south. While the permitting process is not intentionally climate-forward, permitted species outperformed taxon averages, yet state policies often limit production of seaweeds and finfishes, which perform well. Thus, we sit at a critical juncture where the U.S. could capitalize on its seemingly favorable environmental conditions through re-alignment of regulations to support portfolio diversification to include climate-resilient species."

We evaluated a landscape-scale (225 km2) decadal forest carbon budget at a 1 ha spatial resolution in a cool-temperate forest, by repeating airborne laser observations 10 years apart and partitioning net forest biomass change (FBC) into growth and mortality. Using >10 000 samples, we revealed that naturally regenerated forests have large spatial heterogeneity in net biomass change, and 3/4 of the photosynthetically acquired carbon stock moved to necromass even without anthropogenic disturbances. Actual carbon residence time as living tree biomass was estimated by dividing biomass by growth or mortality rates. The residence time was 107 and 106 years, respectively with large spatial variation among stands (48 and 42 years, respectively, as the difference between 25 and 75 percentile), although studied forest stands have small variation in the forest functional type in a landscape-scale. The best predictors of subsequent decadal biomass changes were two forest structural factors, mean canopy height and canopy height variation in addition to one environmental factor, elevation. Considering the long lifetime of trees, these structural factors may be an indicator of forest soundness rather than a cause of forest growth or mortality. However, in any cases, these structural factors can be powerful predictors of subsequent FBC."

This is largely because higher spatial resolution studies on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in China have focused mainly on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. This study uses a spatially detailed integrated energy-economy-climate model to evaluate DACCS for 31 provinces in China as the country pursues its goal of climate neutrality by 2060. We find that DACCS could expand China’s negative emissions capacity, particularly under sustainability-minded limits on bioenergy supply that are informed by bottom-up studies. But providing low-carbon electricity for multiple GtCO2 yr−1 DACCS may require over 600 GW of additional wind and solar capacity nationwide and comprise up to 30% of electricity demand in China’s northern provinces. Investment requirements for DACCS range from $330 to $530 billion by 2060 but could be repaid manyfold in the form of avoided mitigation costs, which DACCS deployment could reduce by up to $6 trillion over the same period. Enhanced efforts to lower residual CO2 emissions that must be offset with CDR under a net-zero paradigm reduce but do not eliminate the use of DACCS for mitigation. For decision-makers and the energy-economy models guiding them, our results highlight the value of expanding beyond the current reliance on biomass for negative emissions in China."

Among different resilience strategies, migration could be effective for nomadic societies despite the potential consequences of conflicts and epidemics. Thus, this study utilizes historical records to statistically investigate the linkages among nomadic migrations, nomad–farmer conflicts, and epidemics under climate change and population pressure in imperial China (200 BCE–1840 CE) on the national and provincial scales. The current study will first attempt to empirically identify and analyze the cost of resilience to climate change mainly in the direction from nomadic societies to agrarian societies in historical China. In particular, we show the cost of nomadic migration passed in a chain mechanism as ‘climate change → nomadic migration → nomad–farmer conflicts → epidemics.’ Nomad–farmer conflicts were one direct effect of nomadic migration, while epidemics were an indirect one. Spatially, more provinces were affected under the direct effect than under the indirect effect. Furthermore, the first level of chain ‘nomadic migration → nomad–farmer conflicts’ covers more provinces than the second level ‘nomad–farmer conflicts → epidemics’. These empirical results remind us to identify and avoid the cost of resilience as early as possible before the cost may transmit further in a chain manner. However, the provinces outside the concentrated nomad–farmer conflicts did not demonstrate significant linkages between conflicts and epidemics, which highlights the importance of peaceful cross-civilizational and inter-societal interactions against common challenges of climate change. This study with a cross-scale perspective in geography provides a theoretical implication to improve the current understanding on climate justice and have a practical value to avoid or minimize the cost of resilience."

Explicit measures of social capital, such as through social network methods, will help build an understanding of how social capital facilitates collective processes and for whom. We reviewed highly cited articles in Web of Science and Scopus using ‘social capital’ as the search term to identify foundational and emergent social capital concepts. In the context of collaborative environmental governance, we operationalized these social capital concepts with network measures drawn from our expertise and highlighted existing empirical relationships between such network measures and collaborative outcomes. We identified two different perspectives on social capital—one based on social relations that could be readily operationalized with social network measures and the other based on actor characteristics that can further contextualize network data. Relational social capital concepts included social relations among actors; the collective social setting in which relations are embedded; and the advantages and costs that social capital confers to individuals and the collective. Social capital concepts based on actor characteristics included socio-cognitions (e.g. trust, norms, identification with a group, shared meanings) and community engagement (e.g. group membership, civic participation, volunteerism). Empirical evidence using social network approaches to measure social capital reveals patterns in relationship building that influence collaborative and other sustainability outcomes. Social network approaches described here may help define and quantify the social capital mobilized by collaborative governance. Additional research is necessary to track the social capital of collaboratives over time, link it to outcomes, and better understand the social justice implications of collaborative governance."

The challenges in comprehending this issue arise from the poorly characterized interaction among different metals and the complexities introduced by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in soil systems. We delved into these complexities by incubating size-fractionated paddy soils under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, utilizing a combination of techniques for aqueous and colloidal analysis. The contaminated paddy soil predominantly consisted of particles measuring <53, 250–53, and 2000–250 μm, with the <53 μm fractions exhibiting the highest concentrations of multiple metals.

Furthermore, glucose enhanced the release of arsenic while simultaneously promoting the sequestration of other metals, such as Pb, Zn, and Cu. Utilizing asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation, we unveiled the presence of both fine (0.3–130 kDa) and large (130–450 nm) colloidal pools, each carrying various metals with different affinities for iron minerals and organic matter. Our results highlighted the pivotal role of the <53 μm fraction as a significant reservoir for multiple metal contaminants in paddy soils, in which the colloidal metals were mainly associated with organic matter.

Distortion/interaction analysis demonstrates that active-site amino acids play a vital role in the enzymatic catalytic efficacy. The unique architecture of SulEP44R’s active site can serve as an excellent template for designing artificial catalysts. Key structural and charge parameters affecting catalytic activity were systematically screened and identified. Based on the elucidated degradation mechanism, several new herbicides with both high herbicidal activity and biodegradability were developed with the aid of a high-throughput strategy.

However, spatial separation of renewables and water resources as well as water scarcity per capita in China necessitate unconventional water resources for electrolysis. Reclaimed water produced from municipal wastewater treatment plants is widely distributed with quality improved significantly in recent years, which may be a promising alternative to feedstock. However, there are few reports on the direct use of this wastewater for H2 production. Here, we present a direct electrolysis of reclaimed water for decentralized H2 production by developing a highly efficient and stable bifunctional 3D-dandelion-like (DL) vanadium(V)-doped CoP catalyst grown in situ on Ni foam (NF) in an alkaline electrolyzer. The V-CoP-DL/NF electrode decreases 6.5 and 25% overpotentials of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, compared to noble-metal Pt (HER) and IrO2 (OER) catalysts, and exhibits exceptional durability, as a voltage required for overall reclaimed water splitting only increases by 80 mV (1.81–1.89 V) after 90 days of operation at a current density of 10 mA cm–2. The maximum stable current can reach 1000 mA cm–2. The impacts of potential pollutants in reclaimed water on the performance of electrolysis and the behavior of major wastewater ions in alkaline electrolyte were investigated. The observed exceptional performance is attributed to the catalyst’s unique nanostructure, which enhances charge transfer and reactant/electrolyte diffusion. The in situ growth strategy further enhances the conductivity and stability of the catalyst.

However, the mechanism driving this contraction is still unclear. Based on the energetics framework of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the decomposition method of the latent heat flux along with the simulations of a climate system model, CESM1.2, we proposed a novel mechanism responsible for the “deep‐tropical contraction” in the early Eocene. The greenhouse gases‐induced sea surface warming amplifies the sensitivity of evaporation to surface wind speed changes through Clausius‐Clapeyron scaling, leading to an interhemispheric asymmetric enhancement of the latent heat flux. To maintain hemispheric energy balance, the cross‐equatorial atmospheric energy transport must be reduced during the solstice seasons. As a result, the solstitial location of the ITCZ shifts equatorward, causing the “deep‐tropical contraction” in the early Eocene."

We develop a marine ecosystem model focusing on phytoplankton dynamics and the competition for multiple resources based on knowledge from in situ data obtained in the Chukchi Sea. The model is designed to include the unique ecological characteristics of the Arctic Ocean. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model successfully simulating the current paradigm for Arctic phytoplankton phenology, including both under‐ice blooms and succession of phytoplankton groups. Sensitivity experiments show that the dominance of diatoms can be sustained by lateral transport of a high‐silicate water mass (Pacific Winter Water). Experiments for future scenarios show that sea ice retreat drives a decrease in large diatoms and an increase in the other relatively small non‐diatom groups. These results suggest that dominant phytoplankton groups can be shifted from diatoms to non‐diatoms under ongoing Arctic Ocean sea ice retreat."

We therefore should consider when the unfrozen water is connected and how permeable can frozen saline sand be, yet there are few studies. This research utilizes in‐situ X‐ray CT to evaluate unfrozen water connectivity and permeability in frozen saline sand considering effects of initial salt content, temperature, freezing rate, and temperature gradient. Results show that higher initial salt content and/or temperature, both of which results in a higher unfrozen water content, easily maintains unfrozen water connectivity. Rapid freezing minimizes the brine expulsion and permits a higher unfrozen water content hence better connectivity. Permeability in frozen saline sand can be several orders higher than the typically reported value, highlighting the potential presence of rapid mass transport through the connected unfrozen water."

However, a physical mechanism that connects radiation to the midlatitude eddy kinetic energy is still uncertain. Using a high‐resolution general circulation model we perform an experiment in which the radiative cooling profile at each model time step is overwritten with the climatological mean, computed from a control simulation. This approach separates the mean and transient effects of radiative heating on the extratropical circulation. We find that, when radiative heating is fixed, the globally‐averaged eddy kinetic energy is enhanced by ∼6%. We show that thermal radiation dampens temperature anomalies near the surface and tropopause in low‐pressure systems, destroying eddy available potential energy and eddy kinetic energy. We identify this as a possible mechanism by which atmospheric radiative heating weakens midlatitude cyclones."

The study employed nine heatwave definitions, based on combinations of three daily mean temperature thresholds (90th, 92.5th, and 95th percentiles) and durations (2, 3, and 4 days). Using quasi‐Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs), we estimated the risks (at lag 0 day) and cumulative effects (lag 0–10 days) of heatwaves on mental disorder outpatient visits. Age, gender, types of medical insurance were considered as potential effect modifiers. We observed a positive association between heatwaves and increased total outpatient visits for mental disorders, both at lag 0 day and during lag 0–10 days. The impact of heatwave was significant at lag 0 day for schizophrenia, mood and neurotic disorders visits, it remained significant for neurotic and mood disorders visits during lag 0–10 days.

 Back contact silicon solar cells, valued for their aesthetic appeal by removing grid lines on the sunny side, find applications in buildings, vehicles and aircrafts, enabling self-power generation without compromising appearance1-3. Patterning techniques arrange contacts on the shaded side of the silicon wafer, offering benefits for light incidence as well. However, the patterning process complicates production and causes power loss. Here we employ lasers to streamline back contact solar cell fabrication and enhance power conversion efficiency. Our approach produces the first silicon solar cell to exceed 27% efficiency. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers are deposited on the wafer for surface passivation and collection of light-generated carriers. A dense passivating contact, diverging from conventional technology practice, is developed. Pulsed picosecond lasers at different wavelengths are used to create back contact patterns. The developed approach is a streamlined process for producing high-performance back contact silicon solar cells, with a total effective processing time of about one-third that of emerging mainstream technology.

 Oil-in-water emulsion is a system with extensive applications in foods, cosmetics and coating industries, and it could also be designed into an artificial lipid droplet in recent works. However, the insights into the biophysical dynamic behaviors of such artificial lipid droplets are lacking. Here, we reveal an enzymatic reaction triggered endocytosis-like behavior in the oil-in-water emulsion lipid droplets. A thermodynamically favored recruitment of lipases onto the membrane of the droplets is demonstrated. We confirm that the hydrolysis of tributyrin by lipases can decrease the interfacial tension and increase the compressive force on the membrane, which are the two main driving forces for triggering the endocytosis-like behavior. The endocytosis-like behavior induced various emerging functionalities of the lipid droplets, including proteins, DNA or inorganic particles being efficiently sequestered into the oil droplet with reversible release as well as enhanced cascade enzymatic reaction. Overall, our studies are expected to open up a way to functionalize oil-in-water emulsions capable of life-inspired behaviors and tackle emerging challenges in bottom-up synthetic biology, revealing the unknown dynamic behaviors of lipid droplets in living organisms.

 Wearable thermoelectric generators provide a reliable power generation method for self-powered wearable electronic devices. However, there has been a lack of research regarding the comfort of wearable thermoelectric generators. Here we propose a design for a comfortable wearable thermoelectric generators system with high output power based on sandwiched thermoelectric model. This model paves the way for simultaneously optimizing comfort (skin temperature and pressure perception) and output power by systematically considering a variety of thermal resistive environments and bending states, the properties of the thermoelectric and encapsulation materials, and the device structure. To verify this strategy, we fabricate wearable thermoelectric generators using Mg-based thermoelectric materials. These materials have great potential for replacing traditional Bi2Te3-based materials and enable our wearable thermoelectric generators with a power density of 18.4 μWcm−2 under a wearing pressure of 0.8 kPa and with a skin temperature of 33 °C, ensuring the wearer’s comfort.

 The fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes is essential for the prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we generate a hepatocyte-specific CHIP knockout (H-KO) mouse model that develops NAFLD more rapidly in response to a high-fat diet (HFD) or high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD). The accumulation of P62 and LC3 in the livers of H-KO mice and CHIP-depleted cells indicates the inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. AAV8-mediated overexpression of CHIP in the murine liver slows the progression of NAFLD induced by HFD or HFHFD feeding. Mechanistically, CHIP induced K63- and K27-linked polyubiquitination at the lysine 198 residue of STX17, resulting in increased STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 complex formation. The STX17 K198R mutant was not ubiquitinated by CHIP; it interfered with its interaction with VAMP8, rendering STX17 incapable of inhibiting steatosis development in mice. These results indicate that a signaling regulatory mechanism involving CHIP-mediated non-degradative ubiquitination of STX17 is necessary for autophagosome-lysosome fusion.

Here, the authors develop cost-effective and accurate plasmonic biosensor platform which detects pyrin-protein levels to aid diagnosis of FMF. 
 Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, primarily observed in populations around the Mediterranean Sea, linked to MEFV gene mutations. These mutations disrupt inflammatory responses, increasing pyrin-protein production. Traditional diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms, family history, acute phase reactants, and excluding similar syndromes with MEFV testing, which is expensive and often inconclusive due to heterozygous mutations. Here, we present a biosensor platform that detects differences in pyrin-protein levels between healthy and affected individuals, offering a cost-effective alternative to genetic testing. Our platform uses gold nanoparticle-based plasmonic chips enhanced with anti-pyrin antibodies, achieving a detection limit of 0.24 ng/mL with high specificity. The system integrates an optofluidic system and visible light spectroscopy for real-time analysis, with signal stability maintained for up to six months. Our technology will enhance FMF diagnosis accuracy, enabling early treatment initiation and providing a cost-effective alternative to genetic testing, thus improving patient care.

 Evolutionarily relevant networks have been previously described in several mammalian species using time-averaged analyses of fMRI time-series. However, fMRI network activity is highly dynamic and continually evolves over timescales of seconds. Whether the dynamic organization of resting-state fMRI network activity is conserved across mammalian species remains unclear. Using frame-wise clustering of fMRI time-series, we find that intrinsic fMRI network dynamics in awake male macaques and humans is characterized by recurrent transitions between a set of 4 dominant, neuroanatomically homologous fMRI coactivation modes (C-modes), three of which are also plausibly represented in the male rodent brain. Importantly, in all species C-modes exhibit species-invariant dynamic features, including preferred occurrence at specific phases of fMRI global signal fluctuations, and a state transition structure compatible with infraslow coupled oscillator dynamics. Moreover, dominant C-mode occurrence reconstitutes the static organization of the fMRI connectome in all species, and is predictive of ranking of corresponding fMRI connectivity gradients. These results reveal a set of species-invariant principles underlying the dynamic organization of fMRI networks in mammalian species, and offer novel opportunities to relate fMRI network findings across the phylogenetic tree.

 Atmospheric moisture transport is pivotal in regulating water resources over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). With the growing concerns about climate change, understanding the evolution of atmospheric moisture transport over the TP has become increasingly critical. however, the spatiotemporal distinctions of this transport remain poorly understood in the CMIP6 models. Here, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of simulated historical atmospheric moisture transport from 33 CMIP6 models, utilizing a novel methodology that assesses the accuracy of model simulations in replicating regional atmospheric moisture transport over the TP. Our results indicate that the CMIP6 models generally succeed in reproducing the broad spatial patterns of atmospheric moisture transport. Nonetheless, substantial errors occur during the monsoon period, primarily attributable to inaccuracies in the location, movement, and intensity of the simulated Indian summer monsoon. The coarser resolution and poor representation of physical processes are potential reasons for errors in atmospheric moisture transport simulation over the TP. The Failure to simulate the terrain blocking on atmospheric moisture transport exacerbates these deficiencies, leading to significant discrepancies. Of the 33 CMIP6 models we investigated, over one-third displayed serious deficiencies in this regard. While coarser resolution and orographic gravity waves are plausible factors, they do not fully account for all the results obtained in this study. Insufficiently detailed or inaccurate topographic data used in the models may also contribute to this deficiency. This study highlights the necessity of using rigorously evaluated models to develop effective regional adaptation strategies over the Tibetan Plateau."

 The presence of plastics and microplastics in water environments has raised concerns for potential negative impacts.

Here, we investigated the role of plastic as a substrate for biofilm growth and how this affects the dispersal of terrestrial microalgae, potentially altering the assembly of pelagic communities. When exposing an artificially assembled microalgae community to pristine and biofouled plastic under laboratory-controlled conditions, we found that only biofouled plastic affected the final community structure and the content of available nutrients in water. This is due to the exchanged algal species between the biofilm and the pelagic community. The results from this batchwise pilot scale study indicate that plastic can act as a substrate for benthic and pelagic species, potentially affecting ecosystem functions, which have been overlooked so far.

 The Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) provides a novel nighttime light (NTL) data product with medium spatial resolution, captured by its unique Glimmer Imager (GLI) sensor. Unlike traditional NTL products, the exceptional resolution of SDGSAT-1 NTL data allows for distinct visualization of urban road networks. Although recent studies have validated the effectiveness of SDGSAT-1 NTL data in supporting various sustainable development goals, their potential for urban road extraction has not yet been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we propose a novel terrain skeleton-based method for extracting urban main roads from SDGSAT-1 NTL images. This proposed method innovatively uses a terrain analogy, considering SDGSAT-1 NTL data as a continuous terrain surface and urban roads as terrain ridge lines to facilitate road extraction. To validate this approach, we selected nine cities with diverse sizes and complex road networks—six in China and three in the United States. Extensive experimental results showed that the proposed method effectively extracts urban roads with an average accuracy of 85.14 % using red-green-blue (RGB) bands and 83.99 % using panchromatic bands, outperforming previous methods, including the optimal threshold, line segment detector, watershed, and U-Net. The main road types extracted were residential, tertiary, secondary, and primary. Additionally, our findings indicated that SDGSAT-1 NTL data capture over 82 % of city road networks, significantly surpassing the coverage provided by the DMSP/OLS, NPP-VIIRS, and Luojia1–01 NTL data. Overall, this study confirms that the significant potential of SDGSAT-1 NTL data for urban main road extraction, offering valuable insights for improving infrastructure mapping and urban planning."

 Rapid and accurate assessment of building damage in sudden-onset disasters is crucial for effective humanitarian assistance and disaster response. However, the occurrence of disasters is highly uncertain, e.g., unexpected geographic location and hazards, which challenge the conventional building damage assessment model on generalization and transferability. Unfortunately, there is little public literature on transferable building damage assessment. This is because assessing building damage using pre- and post-disaster satellite images is a complex, multi-temporal, and multi-task problem. It involves two main subtasks: building localization and damage classification, which are non-trivial to handle with generic transfer learning approaches designed for single-image and single-task problems. On the other hand, post-disaster training image availability in the target domain remains an obstacle since these generic transfer learning methods require pre-/post-disaster image pairs as target training images, resulting in a costly time window (period from obtaining post-event training image to obtaining assessment results) in disaster response. In this paper, we present a single-temporal domain adaptive semantic change detection framework, which frames domain adaptive building damage assessment and only additionally requires target pre-disaster images for adaptation training. Our framework first presents a decoupled task modeling via the equivalent form of prediction error expectations. This enables generic transfer learning methods to be used for domain adaptive building damage assessment. To fundamentally overcome the problem of post-disaster training image availability within our framework, we propose an unsupervised single-temporal change adaptation (STCA) algorithm. The main idea is “damage is everywhere”, which is motivated by the fact that building damage is a change process driven by the disaster event. We leverage target pre-disaster images and source post-disaster images to simulate such semantic change processes to provide training data, fundamentally addressing the post-disaster training image availability issue and avoiding that costly time window. The extensive experiments on global-scale and local-scale study areas suggest that our framework allows most transfer learning approaches to work well on domain adaptive building damage assessment. Our STCA achieves superior performance compared to other transfer learning approaches. More importantly, unlike other approaches that rely on target pre/post-disaster images for adaptation, it requires no target post-disaster training images. This nature significantly improves the availability of STCA in real-world disaster response for the building damage assessment model."

 :Distance and incidence angle effects play crucial roles in determining the raw intensity captured by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems. For these two effects, the emergence of hyperspectral LiDAR necessitates a deep theoretical exploration of potential coupling relationships and wavelength dependence. From a theoretical standpoint, this study provides a systematic demonstration, based on theoretical derivation, focusing on the independence of distance and incidence angle effects and their wavelength dependence, while considering the heterogeneity of natural targets. The key findings are as follows: (1) the distance effect, which is wavelength-independent, is determined by the distance and LiDAR system, characterized by the concept of a “distance effect function”. (2) The incidence angle effect is wavelength-dependent and arises from backscattering characteristic of the target, characterized by the biconical reflectance of the measured target. An accurate expression for this effect should be “incidence angle effect of the target under hyperspectral LiDAR conditions”, rather than the “incidence angle effect of hyperspectral LiDAR system”. (3) Intensity data are simultaneously affected by distance and incidence angle, but these effects are independent and can be individually corrected. (4) Once the distance effect function is obtained for a certain LiDAR system, it can be directly used to correct the distance effect at any time during scanning tasks. However, the incidence angle effect cannot be directly corrected; it requires additional measurements to acquire surface reflection characteristics of the target at various incidence angles. Additionally, this study reviews several basic physical concepts commonly adopted by the optical remote sensing community for modeling the backscattering and reflection processes between LiDAR signals and natural targets. A simplified laser radar equation for small-footprint hyperspectral LiDAR corroborated the classic finding by Kavaya, serving as a theoretical basis for reasoning and understanding the radiative effects. While tailored for hyperspectral LiDAR, the presented fundamental physical concepts and conclusions are also applicable to traditional small-footprint single-wavelength and multispectral LiDAR systems."

 For nearly three decades, geodetic GNSS measurements in Antarctica have provided direct observations of bedrock displacement, which is linked to various geodynamic processes, including plate motion, post-seismic deformation and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Previous geodynamic studies in Antarctica, especially those pertaining to GIA, have been constrained by the limited availability of GNSS data. This is due to the fact that GNSS data are collected by a wide range of institutions and network operators, with the raw observational data either not publicly available or scattered across various repositories. Further, the metadata necessary for rigorous data processing has often not been available or reliable. Consequently, the potential of GNSS observations for geodynamic studies in Antarctica has not been fully exploited yet. Here, we present consistently processed coordinate time series for GNSS sites in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic region for the time span from 1995 to 2021. The data set is composed of 286 continuous and episodic sites, with 258 sites having a time span longer than three years. The coordinate time series were obtained from a combination of four independent processing solutions using different GNSS software and products, allowing the identification of inconsistencies in individual solutions. From these, we infer a reliable and robust combined solution. A key issue was the thorough reassessment of station metadata to minimise artefacts and biases in the coordinate time series. The resulting data set provides coordinate time series with unprecedented spatio-temporal coverage, promising significant advancements in future geodynamic studies."

 Safe and secure carbon dioxide (CO2) storage is likely to be critical for mitigating some of the most dangerous effects of climate change. In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in activity associated with reservoir characterization and site selection for large-scale CO2 storage projects across the globe. These prospective storage sites tend to be terrestrial sites selected for their optimal structural, petrophysical, and geochemical trapping potential. However, it has also been suggested that storing CO2 in reservoirs within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), characterized by high pressures and low temperatures (e.g., Arctic or marine environments), could provide natural thermodynamic and solubility barriers to gas leakage. Evaluating the prospect of commercial-scale, long-term storage of CO2 in the GHSZ requires reservoir-scale modelling capabilities designed to account for the unique physics and thermodynamics associated with these systems. We have developed the HYDRATE flow mode and accompanying fully implicit parallel well model in the massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport simulator PFLOTRAN to model CO2 injection into the marine GHSZ. We have applied these capabilities to a set of CO2 injection scenarios designed to reveal the challenges and opportunities for commercial-scale CO2 storage in the GHSZ.

It better simulates both lake conditions and over-lake atmospheric conditions. More importantly, the study highlights three critical 3D lake processes—ice movement, heat transport, and turbulent mixing—as essential for accurately simulating lake-atmosphere interactions and the Great Lakes’ winter climate. 
 The Laurentian Great Lakes significantly influence the climate of the Midwest and Northeast United States, due to their vast thermal inertia, moisture source potential, and unique heat and moisture flux dynamics. This study presents a newly developed coupled lake-ice-atmosphere (CLIAv1) modeling system for the Great Lakes by coupling the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) regional climate model (RCM) with the three-dimensional (3D) Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) and investigates the impact of coupled dynamics on simulating the Great Lakes' winter climate. By integrating 3D lake hydrodynamics, CLIAv1 addresses the limitations of traditional one-dimensional (1D) lake and demonstrates superior performance in reproducing observed LSTs, ice cover distribution, and the vertical thermal structure of the Great Lakes compared to the NU-WRF model coupled with the default 1D Lake Ice Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS). CLIAv1 also enhances simulation of over-lake atmospheric conditions, including air temperature, wind speed, and sensible and latent heat fluxes, underscoring the importance of resolving complex lake dynamics for reliable climate projections. More importantly, this study addresses the crucial question about what are the key processes influencing lake thermal structure and ice cover that are missed by 1D lake models but effectively captured by 3D lake models. Through process-oriented numerical experiments, we identify key 3D hydrodynamic processes – ice transport, heat advection, and shear production in turbulence – that explain the superiority of 3D lake models over 1D lake models, particularly in cold season performance and lake-atmosphere interactions. Properly resolving these processes using 3D hydrodynamic model is crucial for successfully simulating the lake-ice-atmosphere coupled Great Lakes winter system. This research underscores the necessity of incorporating 3D hydrodynamic models in RCMs to improve our predictive understanding of the Great Lakes' response to climate change. The findings advocate for a shift towards high-resolution, physics-based modeling approaches to ensure accurate future climate and limnological projections for large freshwater systems."

Wick,DC Electric Fields Promote Biodegradation of Waterborne Naphthalene in Biofilter Systems,"Biofiltration is a simple and low-cost method for the cleanup of contaminated water. However, the reduced availability of dissolved chemicals to surface-attached degrader bacteria may limit its efficient use at certain hydraulic loadings. When a direct current (DC) electric field is applied to an immersed packed bed, it invokes electrokinetic processes, such as electroosmotic water flow (EOF). EOF is a surface-charge-induced plug-flow-shaped movement of pore fluids. It acts at a nanometer distance above surfaces and allows the change of microscale pressure-driven flow profiles and, hence, the availability of dissolved contaminants to microbial degraders. In laboratory percolation columns, we assessed the effects of a weak DC electric field (E = 0.5 V·cm–1) on the biodegradation of waterborne naphthalene (NAH) by surface-attached Pseudomonas fluorescens LP6a. To vary NAH bioavailability, we used different NAH concentrations (C0 = 2.7, 5.1, or 7.8 × 10–5 mol·L–1) and Darcy velocities typical for biofiltration (U¯ = 0.2–1.2 × 10–4 m·s–1). In DC-free controls, we observed higher specific degradation rates (qc) at higher NAH concentrations. The qc depended on U¯, suggesting bioavailability restrictions depending on the hydraulic residence times. DC fields consistently increased qc and resulted in linearly increasing benefits up to 55% with rising hydraulic loadings relative to controls. We explain these biodegradation benefits by EOF-altered microscale flow profiles allowing for better NAH provision to bacteria attached to the collectors even though the EOF was calculated to be 100–800 times smaller than bulk water flow. Our data suggest that electrokinetic approaches may give rise to future technical applications that allow regulating biodegradation, for example, in response to fluctuating hydraulic loadings."

Watkins,Metabolomic Alterations Associated with Phthalate Exposures among Pregnant Women in Puerto Rico,"Although phthalate exposure has been linked with multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes, their underlying biological mechanisms are not fully understood. We examined associations between biomarkers of phthalate exposures and metabolic alterations using untargeted metabolomics in 99 pregnant women and 86 newborns [mean (SD) gestational age = 39.5 (1.5) weeks] in the PROTECT cohort. Maternal urinary phthalate metabolites were quantified using isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), while metabolic profiles in maternal and cord blood plasma were characterized via reversed-phase LC-MS. Multivariable linear regression was used in metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) to identify individual metabolic features associated with elevated phthalate levels, while clustering and correlation network analyses were used to discern the interconnectedness of biologically relevant features. In the MWAS adjusted for maternal age and prepregnancy BMI, we observed significant associations between specific phthalates, namely, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), and 34 maternal plasma metabolic features. These associations predominantly included upregulation of fatty acids, amino acids, purines, or their derivatives and downregulation of ceramides and sphingomyelins. In contrast, fewer significant associations were observed with metabolic features in cord blood. Correlation network analysis highlighted the overlap of features associated with phthalates and those identified as differentiating markers for preterm birth in a previous study. Overall, our findings underscore the complex impact of phthalate exposures on maternal and fetal metabolism, highlighting metabolomics as a tool for understanding associated biological processes. Future research should focus on expanding the sample size, exploring the effects of phthalate mixtures, and validating identified metabolic features in larger, more diverse populations."

However, since the 1970s, saltmarsh wetlands in coastal China have been seriously threatened by the invasive Spartina alterniflora. Although the Chinese government has initiated a nationwide S. alterniflora removal project, the potential benefits and risks of this project remain unknown. Here, we focus on the Yangtze River Estuary Saltmarsh Wetland (YRESW) and simulate its future ecosystem structure, function, and quality under three scenarios based on remote sensing and field investigation data. The simulation scenarios include the absence of a removal project, natural regeneration postproject (NRP), and planted restoration postproject. The results show that the removal project will reverse the escalating invasion trend of S. alterniflora in the YRESW. Compared to the baseline year of 2022, there is a remarkable increase in ecosystem structure (composition: +107%, configuration: +27%) and ecosystem quality (+10.5%) under the NRP scenario. Although blue carbon storage sharply decreases under both scenarios involving project implementation, planted restoration can restore YRESW’s carbon sequestration capacity to 0.19 Tg C per year, achieving 87% of the carbon storage present before the project. This study underscores the necessity of comprehensive and detailed risk assessments in ecological projects, particularly when dominant species are involved. Our findings hold significant implications for stabilizing coastal wetland ecosystems and promoting sustainable development in coastal areas."

Exposing spent LIBs to the environment can cause serious environmental harm; however, there is a lack of experimentally obtained information regarding the environmental impacts of abandoned cathode materials. Here, we report the interactions between Shewanella putrefaciens, a microorganism commonly found in diverse low-oxygen natural settings, and LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) under anaerobic conditions. We present compelling evidence that the anaerobic respiration of Shewanella putrefaciens triggers ∼59 and ∼78% dissolution of 0.2 g/L pristine and spent NCM622, respectively. We observed that Shewanella putrefaciens interacted with the pristine and the spent NCM622 under anaerobic conditions at a neutral pH and room temperature and induced the reduction of Ni, Co, and Mn, resulting in the subsequent dissolution of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn. Moreover, we found that secondary mineralization occurred on the surface of reacted NCM622. These findings not only shed light on the substantial impact of microbial respiration on the fate of discarded cathode materials in anaerobic environments but also reveal the potential for sustainable bioleaching of cathodes in spent LIBs."

Illustrating the mitigation potentials of announced policies and identifying additional strategies for various vehicle fleets are fundamental in optimizing future control pathways. Herein, we developed a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from on-road vehicles as well as their mitigation potentials based on real-world databases and up-to-date policy scenarios. Total CO2 emissions of China’s road transportation are estimated to be 1102 million tons (Mt) in 2022 and will continue to increase if future strategies are implemented as usual. Under current development trend and announced policy controls (i.e., integrated scenario), annual CO2 emissions are estimated to peak at 1235 Mt in 2025 and then decline to approximately 200 Mt around 2050. The scenario analysis indicates that electrification of passenger vehicles emerges as the most imperative decarbonization strategy for achieving carbon peak before 2030. Additionally, fuel economy improvement of conventional vehicles is identified to be effective for CO2 emission reduction for trucks until 2035 while new energy vehicle promotion shows great mitigation potentials in the long term.

However, the intrinsic difference in their reactions with organic compounds has not been revealed. This study compared the reaction mechanisms of HO• and Cl• with 13 aromatic and 11 aliphatic compounds by quantum chemical calculation and laser flash photolysis. Both HO• and Cl• can spontaneously react with aromatic compounds via radical adduct formation (RAF), hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), and single electron transfer (SET) pathways. The SET reactions of Cl• were more thermodynamically favorable than HO•, but contrary results were obtained for HAT reactions. According to the free energy of activation (ΔGaq‡), the dominant oxidation mechanisms of aromatic compounds were RAF and SET by HO• and SET by Cl•. The important role of SET in the HO• reactions with aromatic compounds was further verified by accurately calculating the solvation free energy of HO•/HO– and experimentally tracking the radical cations, which were generally neglected in previous studies. Meanwhile, the ΔGaq‡ value of each reaction pathway of Cl• was lower than that of HO•, resulting in  higher rate constants of Cl• with aromatic compounds than HO•. For saturated aliphatic compounds, HAT was found to be the only mechanism accounting for their transformation by HO• and Cl•. This study proposed general rules for the reaction mechanisms of HO• and Cl• and unraveled their differences in the aspects of thermodynamics and kinetics, providing fundamental information for understanding contaminant transformation in processes involving HO• and Cl•."

These variations are well‐explained by upper ocean silicate concentrations, with high opal ‘ballasting’ in the silicate‐deplete tropical Atlantic Ocean, and low ballasting in the silicate‐rich Southern Ocean. A plausible, testable hypothesis is that opal ballasting varies because diatoms grow thicker frustules where silicate concentrations are higher, carrying less organic carbon per unit opal.

This study systematically explores how interspecific interactions and herbivory influence the dominant wetland species, as well as the resultant morphological evolution and landscape configuration. To achieve this, we develop a new eco‐morphodynamic model that integrates hydrodynamics, sediment transport, bed‐level change, and vegetation dynamics. The novelty of the current model lies in newly incorporated modules to simulate biotic interactions between mangroves and saltmarshes, enabling exploration of eco‐morphodynamic feedback in mangrove‐saltmarsh ecotones in response to tidal flows and species interactions. Our results show that vertical growth rates of coexisting vegetation species are dominant factors in determining wetland dominance. When mangroves and saltmarshes exhibit comparable growth rates, mangroves typically become the dominant wetland species. Conversely, if mangroves grow more slowly than saltmarshes, they are unable to outcompete saltmarshes. Additionally, herbivory can fundamentally alter wetland dominance depending on herbivore food preferences. Our simulations further underline that saltmarsh‐dominated wetlands develop channel networks more extensively and rapidly than mangrove‐dominated systems. This pattern is also observed during species invasions, with invading saltmarshes extending channel networks, while invading mangroves inhibit ongoing network expansion. This study highlights the pivotal roles of relative growth properties and herbivory in driving ecotone development in respect to wetland dominance and channel network development at the intertidal scale."

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Assessment Report Six (AR6) took a step toward ending so‐called ‘model democracy’ by discounting climate models that are too warm over the historical period (i.e., models that ‘run hot’) when making projections of global temperature change. However, the IPCC did not address whether this procedure is reliable for other quantities. Here, we explore the implications of weighting climate models according to their skill in reproducing historical global‐mean surface temperature using three other climate variables of interest: global average precipitation change, regional average temperature change, and regional average precipitation change. We find that the temperature‐based weighting scheme leads to an improved prediction of global average precipitation, though we show that this prediction could be overconfident. On regional scales, we find a heterogeneous pattern of error reduction in future regional precipitation. This stands in sharp contrast with the broad regional pattern of error reduction in future temperature projections, though we do find regions where error is not significantly reduced. Our results demonstrate that practitioners using weighted climate model ensembles for climate projections must take care when weighting by temperature alone, lest they produce unreliable climate projections that result from an inappropriate weighting procedure."

This study investigates how copper mining influences the dispersion of these elements in the wind‐transportable fraction (<75 μm) of surface sediments across an 80 km radius. We employed a multi‐pronged approach, utilizing spatial modeling to map element distributions, exponential decay analysis to quantify concentration decline with distance, regime shift modeling to identify dispersion pattern variations, and pollution assessment to evaluate impact. Our results reveal significant mining‐driven increases in surface concentrations of copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), and arsenic (As). Notably, within the first 20 km, concentrations peaked at 1,016 mg kg⁻1 for Cu, 31 mg kg⁻1 for Mo, and a remarkable 165 mg kg⁻1 for As. Cu and Mo displayed significant dispersion, extending up to 50 km from the source. However, As exhibited the most extensive reach, traveling up to 70 km downwind, highlighting the far‐reaching ecological footprint of mining operations. Mineralogical analyses corroborated these findings, identifying mining‐related minerals in surface sediments far beyond the immediate mining area. Although pollution indices based on the proposed Local Geochemical Background reveal significant contamination across the study area, establishing accurate pre‐industrial baseline values is essential for a more reliable assessment. This study challenges the concept of “natural pollution” by demonstrating that human activities exacerbate baseline metal(loid)s levels. Expanding monitoring protocols is imperative to comprehensively assess the combined effects of multiple emission sources, including mining and natural processes, in safeguarding environmental and human health for future generations."

 A goal of neuroscience is to obtain a causal model of the nervous system. The recently reported whole-brain fly connectome1–3 specifies the synaptic paths by which neurons can affect each other, but not how strongly they do affect each other in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a combined experimental and statistical strategy for efficiently learning a causal model of the fly brain, which we refer to as the ‘effectome’. Specifically, we propose an estimator for a linear dynamical model of the fly brain that uses stochastic optogenetic perturbation data to estimate causal effects and the connectome as a prior to greatly improve estimation efficiency. We validate our estimator in connectome-based linear simulations and show that it recovers a linear approximation to the nonlinear dynamics of more biophysically realistic simulations. We then analyse the connectome to propose circuits that dominate the dynamics of the fly nervous system. We discover that the dominant circuits involve only relatively small populations of neurons—thus, neuron-level imaging, stimulation and identification are feasible. This approach also re-discovers known circuits and generates testable hypotheses about their dynamics. Overall, we provide evidence that fly whole-brain dynamics are generated by a large collection of small circuits that operate largely independently of each other. This implies that a causal model of a brain can be feasibly obtained in the fly. Analysis of the whole-brain fly connectome reveals high-dimensional dynamics supported by many small independent circuits, motivating a proposal for optogenetic perturbation to efficiently learn a whole-brain causal neural dynamics model."

 The Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) bilayer nickelate, La3Ni2O7, was recently found to show signatures of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) at pressures above 14 GPa (ref. 1). Subsequent investigations achieved zero resistance in single-crystalline and polycrystalline samples under hydrostatic pressure conditions2–4. Yet, obvious diamagnetic signals, the other hallmark of superconductors, are still lacking owing to the filamentary nature with low superconducting volume fraction2,4,5. The presence of a new 1313 polymorph and competing R–P phases obscured proper identification of the phase for HTSC6–9. Thus, achieving bulk HTSC and identifying the phase at play are the most prominent tasks. Here we address these issues in the praseodymium (Pr)-doped La2PrNi2O7 polycrystalline samples. We find that substitutions of Pr for La effectively inhibit the intergrowth of different R–P phases, resulting in a nearly pure bilayer structure. For La2PrNi2O7, pressure-induced orthorhombic to tetragonal structural transition takes place at Pc ≈ 11 GPa, above which HTSC emerges gradually on further compression.

 Brains comprise complex networks of neurons and connections, similar to the nodes and edges of artificial networks. Network analysis applied to the wiring diagrams of brains can offer insights into how they support computations and regulate the flow of information underlying perception and behaviour. The completion of the first whole-brain connectome of an adult fly, containing over 130,000 neurons and millions of synaptic connections1–3, offers an opportunity to analyse the statistical properties and topological features of a complete brain. Here we computed the prevalence of two- and three-node motifs, examined their strengths, related this information to both neurotransmitter composition and cell type annotations4,5, and compared these metrics with wiring diagrams of other animals. We found that the network of the fly brain displays rich-club organization, with a large population (30% of the connectome) of highly connected neurons. We identified subsets of rich-club neurons that may serve as integrators or broadcasters of signals. Finally, we examined subnetworks based on 78 anatomically defined brain regions or neuropils.

Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviours.

 A central feature of meiosis is the pairing of homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (‘homologues’) along their lengths1–3. Recognition between homologues and their juxtaposition in space is mediated by axis-associated recombination complexes. Also, pairing must occur without entanglements among unrelated chromosomes. Here we examine homologue juxtaposition in real time by four-dimensional fluorescence imaging of tagged chromosomal loci at high spatio-temporal resolution in budding yeast. We discover that corresponding loci come together from a substantial distance (1.8 µm) and complete pairing in a very short time, about 6 min (thus, rapid homologue juxtaposition or RHJ). Homologue loci first move rapidly together (in 30 s, at speeds of roughly 60 nm s−1) into an intermediate stage corresponding to canonical 400 nm axis coalignment. After a short pause, crossover/non-crossover differentiation (crossover interference) mediates a second short, rapid transition that ultimately gives close pairing of axes at 100 nm by means of synaptonemal complex formation. Furthermore, RHJ (1) occurs after chromosomes acquire prophase chromosome organization, (2) is nearly synchronous over thirds of chromosome lengths, but (3) is asynchronous throughout the genome. Finally, cytoskeleton-mediated movement is important for the timing and distance of RHJ onset and for ensuring its normal progression. General implications for local and global aspects of pairing are discussed.

 In response to intense pressure, technology companies have enacted policies to combat misinformation1–4. The enforcement of these policies has, however, led to technology companies being regularly accused of political bias5–7. We argue that differential sharing of misinformation by people identifying with different political groups8–15 could lead to political asymmetries in enforcement, even by unbiased policies. We first analysed 9,000 politically active Twitter users during the US 2020 presidential election. Although users estimated to be pro-Trump/conservative were indeed substantially more likely to be suspended than those estimated to be pro-Biden/liberal, users who were pro-Trump/conservative also shared far more links to various sets of low-quality news sites—even when news quality was determined by politically balanced groups of laypeople, or groups of only Republican laypeople—and had higher estimated likelihoods of being bots. We find similar associations between stated or inferred conservatism and low-quality news sharing (on the basis of both expert and politically balanced layperson ratings) in 7 other datasets of sharing from Twitter, Facebook and survey experiments, spanning 2016 to 2023 and including data from 16 different countries. Thus, even under politically neutral anti-misinformation policies, political asymmetries in enforcement should be expected. Political imbalance in enforcement need not imply bias on the part of social media companies implementing anti-misinformation policies.

 The recent assembly of the adult Drosophila melanogaster central brain connectome, containing more than 125,000 neurons and 50 million synaptic connections, provides a template for examining sensory processing throughout the brain1,2. Here we create a leaky integrate-and-fire computational model of the entire Drosophila brain, on the basis of neural connectivity and neurotransmitter identity3, to study circuit properties of feeding and grooming behaviours. We show that activation of sugar-sensing or water-sensing gustatory neurons in the computational model accurately predicts neurons that respond to tastes and are required for feeding initiation4. In addition, using the model to activate neurons in the feeding region of the Drosophila brain predicts those that elicit motor neuron firing5—a testable hypothesis that we validate by optogenetic activation and behavioural studies. Activating different classes of gustatory neurons in the model makes accurate predictions of how several taste modalities interact, providing circuit-level insight into aversive and appetitive taste processing. Additionally, we applied this model to mechanosensory circuits and found that computational activation of mechanosensory neurons predicts activation of a small set of neurons comprising the antennal grooming circuit, and accurately describes the circuit response upon activation of different mechanosensory subtypes6–10. Our results demonstrate that modelling brain circuits using only synapse-level connectivity and predicted neurotransmitter identity generates experimentally testable hypotheses and can describe complete sensorimotor transformations.

Hurrell,Signature of the western boundary currents in local climate variability,"Analyses based on high-spatial-resolution data demonstrate that sea surface temperature variability in the western boundary currents has a more robust signature in local climate variability than previously indicated. 
 The western boundary currents are characterized by narrow, intense ocean jets and are among the most energetic phenomena in the world ocean. The importance of the western boundary currents to the mean climate is well established: they transport vast quantities of heat from the subtropics to the midlatitudes1, and they govern the structure of the climatological mean surface winds2–6, precipitation4–6 and extratropical storm tracks7–13. Their importance to climate variability is much less clear, as the tropospheric response to extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability is generally modest relative to the internal variability in the midlatitude atmosphere12–14. Here we exploit novel local analyses based on high-spatial-resolution data to demonstrate that SST variability in the western boundary currents has a more robust signature in climate variability than has been indicated in previous work. Our results indicate that warm SST anomalies in the major boundary currents of both hemispheres are associated with a distinct signature of locally enhanced precipitation and rising motion anomalies that extend throughout the depth of the troposphere. The tropospheric signature closely mirrors that of ocean dynamical processes in the boundary currents. Thus, the findings indicate a distinct and robust pathway through which extratropical ocean dynamical processes influence local climate variability. The observational relationships are also reproducible in Earth system model simulations but only when the simulations are run at high spatial resolution. Analyses based on high-spatial-resolution data demonstrate that sea surface temperature variability in the western boundary currents has a more robust signature in local climate variability than previously indicated."

 Natural disasters trigger complex chains of events within human societies1. Immediate deaths and damage are directly observed after a disaster and are widely studied, but delayed downstream outcomes, indirectly caused by the disaster, are difficult to trace back to the initial event1,2. Tropical cyclones (TCs)—that is, hurricanes and tropical storms—are widespread globally and have lasting economic impacts3–5, but their full health impact remains unknown. Here we conduct a large-scale evaluation of long-term effects of TCs on human mortality in the contiguous United States (CONUS) for all TCs between 1930 and 2015. We observe a robust increase in excess mortality that persists for 15 years after each geophysical event. We estimate that the average TC generates 7,000–11,000 excess deaths, exceeding the average of 24 immediate deaths reported in government statistics6,7. Tracking the effects of 501 historical storms, we compute that the TC climate of CONUS imposes an undocumented mortality burden that explains a substantial fraction of the higher mortality rates along the Atlantic coast and is equal to roughly 3.2–5.1% of all deaths. These findings suggest that the TC climate, previously thought to be unimportant for broader public health outcomes, is a meaningful underlying driver for the distribution of mortality risk in CONUS, especially among infants (less than 1 year of age), people 1–44 years of age, and the Black population. Understanding why TCs induce this excess mortality is likely to yield substantial health benefits.

 The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a key model organism in neuroscience, in large part due to the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular, genetic and digital resources available for it. Here we complement the approximately 140,000 neuron FlyWire whole-brain connectome1 with a systematic and hierarchical annotation of neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). Of 8,453 annotated cell types, 3,643 were previously proposed in the partial hemibrain connectome2, and 4,581 are new types, mostly from brain regions outside the hemibrain subvolume. Although nearly all hemibrain neurons could be matched morphologically in FlyWire, about one-third of cell types proposed for the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. We therefore propose a new definition of cell type as groups of cells that are each quantitatively more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain, and we validate this definition through joint analysis of FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for the reliability of connections between brains, revealed broad stereotypy and occasional variability in neuron count and connectivity, and provided evidence for functional homeostasis in the mushroom body through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation/inhibition ratio. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open-source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics.

 Mutation of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (encoded by TET2) drives myeloid malignancy initiation and progression1–3. TET2 deficiency is known to cause a globally opened chromatin state and activation of genes contributing to aberrant haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal4,5. However, the open chromatin observed in TET2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, leukaemic cells and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells5 is inconsistent with the designated role of DNA 5-methylcytosine oxidation of TET2. Here we show that chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding-domain protein MBD6, which guides deubiquitination of nearby monoubiquitinated Lys119 of histone H2A (H2AK119ub) to promote an open chromatin state. TET2 oxidizes m5C and antagonizes this MBD6-dependent H2AK119ub deubiquitination. TET2 depletion thereby leads to globally decreased H2AK119ub, more open chromatin and increased transcription in stem cells. TET2-mutant human leukaemia becomes dependent on this gene activation pathway, with MBD6 depletion selectively blocking proliferation of TET2-mutant leukaemic cells and largely reversing the haematopoiesis defects caused by Tet2 loss in mouse models. Together, our findings reveal a chromatin regulation pathway by TET2 through retrotransposon RNA m5C oxidation and identify the downstream MBD6 protein as a feasible target for developing therapies specific against TET2 mutant malignancies. Chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding-domain protein MBD6, which guides deubiquitination of nearby monoubiquitinated Lys119 of histone H2A to promote an open chromatin state in TET2-deficient cells."

 A catalogue of neuronal cell types has often been called a ‘parts list’ of the brain1, and regarded as a prerequisite for understanding brain function2,3. In the optic lobe of Drosophila, rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to be essential for understanding fly vision4,5. Here we analyse the fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells, and integrate information over medium distances in the visual field. Some existing type families (Tm, Li, and LPi)6–10 at least double in number of types. A new serpentine medulla (Sm) interneuron family contains more types than any other. Three families of cross-neuropil types are revealed. The consistency of types is demonstrated by analysing the distances in high-dimensional feature space, and is further validated by algorithms that select small subsets of discriminative features. We use connectivity to hypothesize about the functional roles of cell types in motion, object and colour vision. Connectivity with ‘boundary types’ that straddle the optic lobe and central brain is also quantified. We showcase the advantages of connectomic cell typing: complete and unbiased sampling, a rich array of features based on connectivity and reduction of the connectome to a substantially simpler wiring diagram of cell types, with immediate relevance for brain function and development.

 Many animals use visual information to navigate1–4, but how such information is encoded and integrated by the navigation system remains incompletely understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, EPG neurons in the central complex compute the heading direction5 by integrating visual input from ER neurons6–12, which are part of the anterior visual pathway (AVP)10,13–16. Here we densely reconstruct all neurons in the AVP using electron-microscopy data17. The AVP comprises four neuropils, sequentially linked by three major classes of neurons: MeTu neurons10,14,15, which connect the medulla in the optic lobe to the small unit of the anterior optic tubercle (AOTUsu) in the central brain; TuBu neurons9,16, which connect the AOTUsu to the bulb neuropil; and ER neurons6–12, which connect the bulb to the EPG neurons. On the basis of morphologies, connectivity between neural classes and the locations of synapses, we identify distinct information channels that originate from four types of MeTu neurons, and we further divide these into ten subtypes according to the presynaptic connections in the medulla and the postsynaptic connections in the AOTUsu. Using the connectivity of the entire AVP and the dendritic fields of the MeTu neurons in the optic lobes, we infer potential visual features and the visual area from which any ER neuron receives input. We confirm some of these predictions physiologically. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding how distinct sensory features can be extracted and transformed across multiple processing stages to construct higher-order cognitive representations.

 Lysosomes have crucial roles in regulating eukaryotic metabolism and cell growth by acting as signalling platforms to sense and respond to changes in nutrient and energy availability1. LYCHOS (GPR155) is a lysosomal transmembrane protein that functions as a cholesterol sensor, facilitating the cholesterol-dependent activation of the master protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)2. However, the structural basis of LYCHOS assembly and activity remains unclear. Here we determine several high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of human LYCHOS, revealing a homodimeric transmembrane assembly of a transporter-like domain fused to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) domain. The class B2-like GPCR domain is captured in the apo state and packs against the surface of the transporter-like domain, providing an unusual example of a GPCR as a domain in a larger transmembrane assembly. Cholesterol sensing is mediated by a conserved cholesterol-binding motif, positioned between the GPCR and transporter domains. We reveal that the LYCHOS transporter-like domain is an orthologue of the plant PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporter family, and has greater structural similarity to plant auxin transporters than to known human transporters. Activity assays support a model in which the LYCHOS transporter and GPCR domains coordinate to sense cholesterol and regulate mTORC1 activation.

 The brain helps us survive by forming internal representations of the external world1,2. Excitatory cortical neurons are often precisely tuned to specific external stimuli3,4. However, inhibitory neurons, such as parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, are generally less selective5. PV interneurons differ from excitatory neurons in their neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, including AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors (AMPARs)6,7. Excitatory neurons express calcium-impermeable AMPARs that contain the GluA2 subunit (encoded by GRIA2), whereas PV interneurons express receptors that lack the GluA2 subunit and are calcium-permeable (CP-AMPARs). Here we demonstrate a causal relationship between CP-AMPAR expression and the low feature selectivity of PV interneurons. We find low expression stoichiometry of GRIA2 mRNA relative to other subunits in PV interneurons that is conserved across ferrets, rodents, marmosets and humans, and causes abundant CP-AMPAR expression. Replacing CP-AMPARs in PV interneurons with calcium-impermeable AMPARs increased their orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Manipulations to induce sparse CP-AMPAR expression demonstrated that this increase was cell-autonomous and could occur with changes beyond development. Notably, excitatory–PV interneuron connectivity rates and unitary synaptic strength were unaltered by CP-AMPAR removal, which suggested that the selectivity of PV interneurons can be altered without markedly changing connectivity. In Gria2-knockout mice, in which all AMPARs are calcium-permeable, excitatory neurons showed significantly degraded orientation selectivity, which suggested that CP-AMPARs are sufficient to drive lower selectivity regardless of cell type. Moreover, hippocampal PV interneurons, which usually exhibit low spatial tuning, became more spatially selective after removing CP-AMPARs, which indicated that CP-AMPARs suppress the feature selectivity of PV interneurons independent of modality. These results reveal a new role of CP-AMPARs in maintaining low-selectivity sensory representation in PV interneurons and implicate a conserved molecular mechanism that distinguishes this cell type in the neocortex. Calcium-permeable AMPA receptors are identified to have a role in maintaining low feature selectivity in a specific population of inhibitory interneurons, and this function is conserved across ferrets, rodents, marmosets and humans."

 As connectomics advances, it will become commonplace to know far more about the structure of a nervous system than about its function. The starting point for many investigations will become neuronal wiring diagrams, which will be interpreted to make theoretical predictions about function. Here I demonstrate this emerging approach with the Drosophila optic lobe, analysing its structure to predict that three Dm3 (refs. 1–4) and three TmY (refs. 2,4) cell types are part of a circuit that serves the function of form vision. Receptive fields are predicted from connectivity, and suggest that the cell types encode the local orientation of a visual stimulus. Extraclassical5,6 receptive fields are also predicted, with implications for robust orientation tuning7, position invariance8,9 and completion of noisy or illusory contours10,11. The TmY types synapse onto neurons that project from the optic lobe to the central brain12,13, which are conjectured to compute conjunctions and disjunctions of oriented features. My predictions can be tested through neurophysiology, which would constrain the parameters and biophysical mechanisms in neural network models of fly vision14.

Bidaye,Neural circuit mechanisms underlying context-specific halting in <i>Drosophila</i>,"Two halting mechanisms, ‘walk-OFF’ and ‘brake’, are shown to be engaged by distinct neural circuits in Drosophila, in a context dependent manner. 
 Walking is a complex motor programme involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical component of walking control. Despite progress in identifying neurons driving halting1–6, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking state remain unclear. Here, using connectome-informed models7–9 and functional studies, we explain two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism (‘walk-OFF’) relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, whereas the second mechanism (‘brake’) relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. We show that two neurons that deploy the walk-OFF mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward walking or turning. The brake neurons, by constrast, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking-promotion neurons and increasing the resistance at the leg joints. We characterized two behavioural contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the walk-OFF mechanism was engaged for halting during feeding and the brake mechanism was engaged for halting and stability during grooming. Two halting mechanisms, ‘walk-OFF’ and ‘brake’, are shown to be engaged by distinct neural circuits in Drosophila, in a context dependent manner."

 Ageing impairs the ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) to transition from quiescence to proliferation in the adult mammalian brain. Functional decline of NSCs results in the decreased production of new neurons and defective regeneration following injury during ageing1–4. Several genetic interventions have been found to ameliorate old brain function5–8, but systematic functional testing of genes in old NSCs—and more generally in old cells—has not been done. Here we develop in vitro and in vivo high-throughput CRISPR–Cas9 screening platforms to systematically uncover gene knockouts that boost NSC activation in old mice. Our genome-wide screens in primary cultures of young and old NSCs uncovered more than 300 gene knockouts that specifically restore the activation of old NSCs. The top gene knockouts are involved in cilium organization and glucose import. We also establish a scalable CRISPR–Cas9 screening platform in vivo, which identified 24 gene knockouts that boost NSC activation and the production of new neurons in old brains. Notably, the knockout of Slc2a4, which encodes the GLUT4 glucose transporter, is a top intervention that improves the function of old NSCs. Glucose uptake increases in NSCs during ageing, and transient glucose starvation restores the ability of old NSCs to activate. Thus, an increase in glucose uptake may contribute to the decline in NSC activation with age. Our work provides scalable platforms to systematically identify genetic interventions that boost the function of old NSCs, including in vivo, with important implications for countering regenerative decline during ageing.

 Endosymbioses have profoundly impacted the evolution of life and continue to shape the ecology of a wide range of species. They give rise to new combinations of biochemical capabilities that promote innovation and diversification1,2. Despite the many examples of known endosymbioses across the tree of life, their de novo emergence is rare and challenging to uncover in retrospect3–5. Here we implant bacteria into the filamentous fungus Rhizopus microsporus to follow the fate of artificially induced endosymbioses. Whereas Escherichia coli implanted into the cytosol induced septum formation, effectively halting endosymbiogenesis, Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica was transmitted vertically to the progeny at a low frequency. Continuous positive selection on endosymbiosis mitigated initial fitness constraints by several orders of magnitude upon adaptive evolution. Phenotypic changes were underscored by the accumulation of mutations in the host as the system stabilized. The bacterium produced rhizoxin congeners in its new host, demonstrating the transfer of a metabolic function through induced endosymbiosis. Single-cell implantation thus provides a powerful experimental approach to study critical events at the onset of endosymbiogenesis and opens opportunities for synthetic approaches towards designing endosymbioses with desired traits. A study presents an approach to establish and track a new endosymbiotic partnership by implanting bacteria in a non-host fungus and shows that stable inheritance of the implanted bacteria is possible with positive selection."

 The study investigates the global impact of land property rights on land use efficiency (LUE), as measured by the key indicator for United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11.3.1, namely Land Consumption Rate to Population Growth Rate. By utilizing human-land change data from 165 countries spanning the period between 1990 and 2020, we have developed a fixed effects model and employed legal origins as an instrumental variable to examine the influence of land property rights security on LUE. Our findings demonstrate that the security of land property rights significantly influences LUE, with common law countries exhibiting higher levels of LUE compared to civil law countries while controlling for other variables. Stability in property rights encourages long-term investments in infrastructure and sustainable land management practices, thereby enhancing land productivity and mitigating urban sprawl. Furthermore, safeguarding property rights limits governments’ power to expropriate lands, facilitating rational and efficient land transactions that contribute towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

In this work, it is shown that the sub-gap states of multi-spin impurities are intimately linked, leading to unexpected behavior. 
 Understanding the interplay between individual magnetic impurities and superconductivity is crucial for bottom-up construction of novel phases of matter. Sub-gap bound states that are used in this endeavor are typically considered as independent entities that each result from the exchange scattering between the respective impurity orbitals and electrons of the superconducting condensate. Here we present experimental evidence of individual multi-spin impurities where the sub-gap states are not independent. Specifically, we find that by tuning the energy of the state closest to zero through zero, all other sub-gap states change particle-hole asymmetry as well. We show that this can be understood by including Hund’s coupling, which favors high-spin configurations, into a multi-orbital Anderson model. Unlike for the case of independent spins, the transition we observe signals the simultaneous departure of more than one quasiparticle from the impurity, while the parity of the ground state may remain unchanged. Our results show that Hund’s coupling is not only crucial in generating high-spin impurities, but also to understand the transition between two distinct ground states, and should therefore be taken into account for e.g. impurity-based band-structure engineering. Sub-gap states generated by single spins in a superconductor can be used as building blocks for quantum devices.

 Personalized treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors critically depends on the deep characterization of tumor cells from patient biopsies. Here, we comprehensively characterize a pan-cancer cohort of 150 malignant serous effusion (MSE) samples at the cellular, molecular, and functional level. We find that MSE-derived cancer cells retain the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of their corresponding primary tumors, validating their use as a patient-relevant model system for solid tumor biology. Integrative analyses reveal that baseline gene expression patterns relate to global ex vivo drug sensitivity, while high-throughput drug-induced transcriptional changes in MSE samples are indicative of drug mode of action and acquired treatment resistance. A case study exemplifies the added value of multi-modal MSE profiling for patients who lack genetically stratified treatment options.

 Sedimentary records of Early Pleistocene (~2.6–0.8 Ma) glaciations are sparse on shelves, yet trough mouth fans on adjacent continental slopes provide a continuous record of ice-sheet and climate development throughout the Quaternary. Here, we interpret high-quality 3D seismic reflection data combined with borehole and chronostratigraphic information from a shelf-slope setting in the southwestern Barents Sea to study meltwater and sediment inputs to the deep ocean, focusing on the onset of Pleistocene glaciations. Sandy deposits were brought to the slopes of the high-latitude Bear Island Fan by a preglacial contourite-turbidite system from ⁓2.6–2.4 Ma. Muddy glacigenic debris flows document the first shelf-edge glaciation at ⁓2.4 Ma. From 1.78–0.78 Ma, muddy turbidity-current- and debris-flow-derived sediments were delivered from shelf to slope via six tunnel valleys measuring up to 12 km in width and 200 m in depth. These tunnel valleys and associated downslope deposits formed during the 41-kyr climate cycles of the Early Pleistocene, and evidence abundant channelized, meltwater discharges from these glaciations. Following the mid-Pleistocene transition to 100-kyr cycles, a change in the style of glaciation is suggested by a change in landform and facies associations consistent with a reduced meltwater contribution. This study shows that the Norwegian-Barents shelf was extensively glaciated in the Early Pleistocene, with a first shelf-edge glaciation from ~2.4 Ma. 3D seismic data from the continental shelf of the Barents Sea indicate a switch in the character of glaciation from a high meltwater regime generating extensive tunnel valleys to a regime of reduced meltwater contribution from the mid-Pleistocene"

 Earth observation data is key for monitoring vegetation dynamics across temporal and spatial scales. The most widely used method to estimate vegetation properties from Earth observation data is vegetation indices. However, temporal dynamics in vertical leaf angles can strongly alter reflectance signals and, hence, vegetation indices. Here, we derive leaf angles from plant photographs to simulate the effect on vegetation indices with radiative transfer models. We show that leaf angle dynamics systematically confound widely applied vegetation indices. Moreover, we demonstrate that these effects are not random but tightly linked to abiotic environmental conditions. These systematic effects of vertical leaf angles have implications for monitoring plant properties, biodiversity, and ecosystem functional properties. We discuss the related challenges and opportunities to assess spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics with remote sensing and vegetation indices.

 Occupants and indoor activities are sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We propose a framework to simulate the pollutant pathway using the INCA-Indoor© model and VOC emission rates to derive dynamic concentrations, and the USEtox model to evaluate health impacts in DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years). The applicability of the framework is tested on a case study, and the effect of indoor chemical reactions on health impacts is assessed. In this case study, health impacts were of 0.3 μDALY/day without and 0.4 μDALY/day (13 s/day) with indoor air chemistry (+28 %) out of which 12 % were linked to occupant breath and skin emissions. Cleaning activities led to the highest impacts without chemical reactions (terpinolene, responsible for 0.14 μDALY/day), but indoor air chemistry led to high impacts linked to formaldehyde formation (0.18 μDALY/day). These reactions led to the formation of more formaldehyde, hence leading to 20% more impacts, in summer than in winter. Occupants’ contribution to CO2 concentrations exceeded recommended limits under the given occupancy and ventilation scenario. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation affected indoor particulate matter mass concentrations by up to a factor 1.2 and their number concentrations by up to a factor 25,000 in the presence of VOC emissions. Results of this study indicate that chemical reactions and SOA formation are important factors to consider in indoor air quality impact assessment. A larger number of activities and scenarios can be tested to improve the robustness of the conclusions, since, under different scenarios (for e.g. activities with lower emission rates) and with more complete toxicity data, these conclusions are likely to change."

 Temperature (T), pressure (p), and density (ρ) are fundamental variables describing the atmospheric behavior. This study investigates the interdependence of these variables near Earth's surface in real-world conditions, by evaluating data from different European weather stations. It has been found that the correlation between pressure and temperature is strongly related to the dynamics of the PBL that facilitates a two-group classification. The first group includes all the stations in the plain or in the valley-floor and exhibits a weak correlation, R(p,T). 2D density plots representing hourly pressure against temperature have a distinctive triangular shape at these stations. Regardless of location, the upper boundary of this triangle consistently fits a linear equation with a constant slope and an intercept that scales with the average pressure of the station. This finding holds promising implications for enhancing the quality check of pressure and temperature data, enabling the identification of implausible measurements using a unified equation. In contrast, the second group includes stations with a strongly positive correlation R(p,T) and a more linear density plot; it includes all stations near a mountain-top. Their correlations exhibit identical features when compared to radiosounding data extracted at corresponding heights. The study concludes that: i) the first group of stations is significantly influenced by non-hydrostatic processes such as turbulence, friction and surface radiative heating/cooling in the PBL, resulting in weakly negative R(p,T) for shorter timescales that become null over longer durations; ii) the second group of stations has R(p,T) characteristics similar to the free atmosphere, predominantly regulated by hydrostatic balance and the advection of sensible heat."

 This study investigates the impacts of climate change on temperature and precipitation extremes in eight West Asian countries (Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey, and Iraq) using a regional ensemble of CMIP6 models. Ten models were evaluated based on their performance in simulating historical temperature and precipitation using the KGE index. Four climate extreme indices (Tmax, Pmax, TX90p and R95p) were employed to assess changes in temperature and precipitation extremes in the study area. The analysis of climate extremes reveals significant projected changes. Tmax is expected to increase in all countries, with the most pronounced rise anticipated in Turkmenistan, where Tmax in the main part of the country is projected to increase by more than 5 °C under the SSP585. Projections for Pmax show a more nuanced picture. Pakistan is expected to experience the highest overall Pmax. TX90p is projected to increase in all countries, indicating a rise in the frequency of extreme heat events. Pakistan is expected to experience the most significant increase in TX90p, reaching up to 36.1 % under the SSP585 (FF) scenario by 2074, followed by Iran and Afghanistan. R95p does not show a clear future trend. Pakistan is anticipated to see the highest increase in R95p, reaching up to 15.2 mm under the SSP585 scenario by 2074, while Turkey might experience a decrease of up to 7.8 mm under the SSP245 scenario. These findings highlight the diverse and concerning impacts of climate change on temperature and precipitation extremes across West Asia. The projected increase in Tmax, TX90p and potential shifts in precipitation patterns pose significant challenges for the region. This study emphasizes the need for region-specific adaptation strategies to address the multifaceted challenges of climate change in West Asia."

Disruption to the molecular structure of collagen is fundamental for the onset and progression of tendinopathy but has mostly been investigated in vitro. Here, we interrogated the in vivo molecular structure changes of collagen in rat Achilles tendons following treadmill running. Unexpectedly, the tendons’ collagen molecules were not mechanically unfolded by running but denatured through proteolysis during physiological post-run remodeling. We further revealed that running induces inflammatory gene expressions in Achilles tendons and that long-term running causes prolonged, elevated collagen degradation, leading to the accumulation of denatured collagen and tendinopathy development. For applications, we demonstrated magnetic resonance imaging of collagenase-induced Achilles tendon injury in vivo using a denatured collagen targeting contrast agent. Our findings may help close the knowledge gaps in the mechanobiology and pathogenesis of Achilles tendinopathy and initiate new strategies for its imaging-based diagnosis."

NOD-like receptors (NLRs) comprise a highly evolutionarily conserved family of cytosolic bacterial sensors, yet their impact on antitumor immunity against HCC remains unclear. In this study, we uncovered that NOD1, a well-studied member of NLR family, exhibits predominant expression in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and correlates positively with improved prognosis and responses to anti–PD-1 treatments in patients with HCC. Activation of NOD1 in vivo augments antitumor immunity and enhances the effectiveness of anti–PD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, NOD1 activation resulted in diminished expression of perilipin 5, thereby hindering fatty acid oxidation and inducing free fatty acid accumulation in TAMs. This metabolic alteration promoted membrane localization of the costimulatory molecule OX40L in a lipid modification–dependent manner, thereby activating CD8+T cells.

However, in metal-free systems, the spin orbitals are largely delocalized, and weak coupling between the spins in the lattice hampers long-range ordering. Metal-free magnetism is of fundamental interest to physical sciences, unlocking unprecedented dimensions for strongly correlated materials and biocompatible magnets. Here, we present a strategy to achieve strong coupling between spin centers of planar radical monomers in π-conjugated two-dimensional (2D) polymers and rationally control the orderings. If the π-states in these triangulene-based 2D polymers are half-occupied, then we predict that they are antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulators. Incorporating a boron or nitrogen heteroatom per monomer results in Stoner ferromagnetism and half-metallicity, with the Fermi level located at spin-polarized Dirac points. An unprecedented antiferromagnetic half-semiconductor is observed in a binary boron-nitrogen–centered 2D polymer.

While dysregulation of the splicing process is considered a cancer hallmark, the role of certain splicing factors remains unknown in PCa. This study focuses on characterizing the levels and role of SRSF6 in this disease. Comprehensive analyses of SRSF6 alterations (copy number/mRNA/protein) were conducted across eight well-characterized PCa cohorts and the Hi-MYC transgenic model. SRSF6 was up-regulated in PCa samples, correlating with adverse clinical parameters. Functional assays, both in vitro (cell proliferation, migration, colony, and tumorsphere formation) and in vivo (xenograft tumors), demonstrated the impact of SRSF6 modulation on critical cancer hallmarks. Mechanistically, SRSF6 regulates the splicing pattern of the histone-chaperoneHIRA, consequently affecting the activity of H3.3 in PCa and breast cancer cell models and disrupting pivotal oncogenic pathways (AR and E2F) in PCa cells.

We demonstrate that loss of 21URNAs compromises homolog pairing and makes it permissive for nonhomologous synapsis resulting in defects in crossover formation and chromosome segregation during spermatogenesis. We identify Polo-like kinase 3 (PLK-3), among others, as a 21URNA target. 21URNA activity restricts PLK-3 protein to proliferative cells, and expansion of PLK-3 in pachytene overlaps with the meiotic defects. Removal ofplk-3results in quantitative genetic suppression of the meiotic defects. One discrete 21URNA inhibits PLK-3 expression in late pachytene cells.

Clic1-mediated currents can be enhanced by E2and reduced by its depletion. In addition, Clic1 currents are required to mediate the E2-induced rapid excitations in multiple brain ERα populations. Further, genetic disruption of Clic1 in hypothalamic ERα neurons blunts the regulations of E2on female body weight balance.

Differences in the inflammatory microenvironment emerged as an explanation for such stage dependency. Functional analyses revealed that enhancing neuroinflammation is sufficient to trigger Müller cell proliferation, not only in young tadpoles but also in mice. In addition, we showed that microglia are absolutely required for the response of mouse Müller cells to mitogenic factors while negatively affecting their neurogenic potential.

In contrast, generation of theADOknockout mouse revealed high tolerance for ADO depletion in adult tissues. To understand the mechanism underlying ADO’s essentiality in cancer cells, we characterized the cell proteome and metabolome following depletion of ADO. This revealed that ADO depletion leads to toxic levels of polyamines which can be driven by ADO’s substrate cysteamine. Polyamine accumulation in turn stimulated expression of proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) which resulted in mitochondrial hyperactivity and ROS production, culminating in cell toxicity. This work identifies ADO as a unique vulnerability in cancer cells, due to its essential role in maintenance of redox homeostasis through restraining polyamine levels and proline catabolism."

We show that higher-order interactions can have opposite effects on linear stability and basin stability: They stabilize twisted states (including full synchrony) by improving their linear stability, but also make them hard to find by markedly reducing their basin size. Our results highlight the importance of understanding higher-order interactions from both local and global perspectives."

These biomedical implants can record electrophysiological signals and execute direct therapeutic interventions within internal organs, offering transformative potential in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of various pathological conditions. However, challenges remain in improving excessive impedance at the bioelectronic-tissue interface and thus the efficacy of electrophysiological signaling and intervention. Here, we devise orbit symmetry breaking in MXene (a low-cost scalability, biocompatible, and conductive two dimensionally layered material, which we refer to as OBXene), which exhibits low bioelectronic-tissue impedance, originating from the out-of-plane charge transfer. Furthermore, the Schottky-induced piezoelectricity stemming from the asymmetric orbital configuration of OBXene facilitates interlayered charge transport in the device. We report an OBXene-based cardiac patch applied on the left ventricular epicardium of both rodent and porcine models to enable spatiotemporal epicardium mapping and pacing while coupling the wireless and battery-free operation for long-term real-time recording and closed-loop stimulation."

Spatial adiabatic passage (SAP) is a prime example of this phenomenon, where a wave packet is transferred between two uncoupled localized modes by adjusting the tunneling coupling to an intermediate third mode in a counterintuitive sequence. Although this concept was introduced over two decades ago, its observation was previously limited to electromagnetic waves. In this study, we demonstrate this quantum interference effect using massive particles that tunnel between three micro-optical traps (“optical tweezers”). We begin by preparing ultracold fermionic atoms in low vibrational eigenstates of one trap, followed by manipulating the distance between the traps to execute the SAP protocol. We observe a smooth and high-efficiency transfer of atoms between the two outer traps, with a very low population remaining in the central trap.

However, the role of m6A in regulating cutaneous inflammation remains elusive. Here, we reveal that the m6A and its methyltransferase METTL3 are down-regulated in keratinocytes in inflammatory skin diseases. Inducible deletion ofMettl3in murine keratinocytes results in spontaneous skin inflammation and increases susceptibility to cutaneous inflammation with activation of neutrophil recruitment. Therapeutically, restoration of m6A alleviates the disease phenotypes in mice and suppresses inflammation in human biopsy specimens. We support a model in which m6A modification stabilizes the mRNA of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme ELOVL6 via the m6A reader IGF2BP3, leading to a rewiring of fatty acid metabolism with a reduction in palmitic acid accumulation and, consequently, suppressing neutrophil chemotaxis in cutaneous inflammation. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized epithelial-intrinsic m6A modification–lipid metabolism pathway that is essential for maintaining epidermal and immune homeostasis and lay the basis for potential therapeutic targeting of m6A modulators to attenuate inflammatory skin diseases."

We demonstrate here that the addition of nitrate to pyrophosphate-chelated Sn(II)(aq)suppresses Sn(II) oxidation in water across a broad pH range. Evidence of hydroxyl radical concentration reduction and detection of a radical nitrogen species that only forms in the presence of chelated Sn(II) point to a radical-based reaction mechanism.

There are coastal regions of high interest, such as urban areas, where a large number of people are exposed to hydrometeorological hazards, and ecosystems, which provide protection, where long-term natural variability should be considered a design factor. In this study, we systematized climate analysis to identify high-interest regions where hazard long-term variability should be considered in risk assessment, disaster reduction, and future climate change adaptation and protection designs. To achieve this goal, we examined the effect of the leading modes of climate variability (Arctic Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode, and El Niño–Southern Oscillation) on the variation in the recurrence of extreme coastal hazard events, including as a first step sea surface temperature, winds, and waves. Neglecting long-term variability could potentially lead to the underperformance of solutions, or even irreversible damage that compromises the conditions of ecosystems for which nature-based solutions are designed."

Changing mountain headwaters, marked by reduced snowpacks, retreating glaciers, shifting precipitation patterns, and rising temperatures, pose a crucial question: what is the resilience of streamflow in these mountains, and what role does GW play in this resilience? This is particularly uncertain in tropical high mountains where the seasonality of precipitation and glacier melt govern streamflow generation. A glacio-hydrological model was created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform to investigate cryosphere-surface water–GW interactions in the Quilcayhuanca Basin, in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca. The model was forced by in-situ meteorological observations and parameterized using numerous data sources and process-based studies in the basin. Model results show that during the dry season, 37% of streamflow is generated from GW discharge, increasing to 56% during the lowest flows. Evapotranspiration is the largest mass flux from the basin at the peak of the dry season. Precipitation, temperature, and glacier change scenarios were used to assess the sensitivity of basin hydrology to climate change and glacier retreat. In a warmer, wetter, and nearly deglaciated future, Quilcayhuanca basin streamflow is expected to decrease by 4%–19% annually, with a larger volumetric change in overland and vadose zone flow than in GW flow. The range in values is more closely linked to uncertainty in precipitation change than temperature change. Despite a strong reduction in snow and ice contribution to streamflow with warming and deglaciation, the concomitant increase in precipitation can limit the changes in streamflow and GW flow, showcasing the resilience of the system to shifts in climate and glacier cover."

However, while efforts have focused on improving access and initial adoption, little attention has been given to social disparities in rates of adoption and the benefits derived from these technologies. Our study investigates the adoption of groundwater irrigation technology in India, a transformative innovation that has historically enhanced productivity and food security, and helped agricultural households adapt to a changing climate. We use a nationwide household survey sample that spans nearly a decade, capturing a key period of groundwater expansion in India. Our analysis reveals that members of highly marginalized social groups are less likely to adopt groundwater irrigation technologies, and less likely to sustain their use of the technologies for long periods of time. Furthermore, the household-level benefits of the technologies–operationalized through the relationship between technology adoption and income–appear lower for households belonging to historically marginalized groups compared to the historically advantaged. Our study underscores the importance of addressing social inequalities in both adoption as well as the sustained utilization of agricultural technologies and other climate adaptation tools. Disparities in the utilization of these technologies can hinder farmers’ ability to access new innovations and adapt to increasing threats from climate change. Targeted policies and interventions are essential to not only provide historically marginalized groups access to technological innovations, but also facilitate their effective utilization."

Its major rivers are subject to extensive water management (WM) activities in order to sustain multisectoral water demands, particularly during drought conditions. However, the impact of WM on the propagation dynamics and characteristics of hydrological drought (HD) in Texas remains unclear. To fill this gap, this study quantifies the influence of WM across 32 streamflow gauges along the mainstems of seven major rivers in Texas by comparing a variety of drought metrics under natural and managed conditions. Notably, we leveraged an extensive, naturalized streamflow dataset constructed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, paired with gauge observations of managed conditions. Results indicate that at the multi-decadal scale, WM significantly reduced HD frequency across all seven rivers and at 81% of the gauges analyzed. Additionally, it increased the response timescale of HD across Texas’ major rivers by a median of 2.5 months. Conversely, the average-event duration and severity increased in most locations. Temporal analysis reveals that the WM impact on HD varied seasonally, with attenuation effects during mid-summer and early fall and intensification effects during late winter and spring. Additionally, WM was found to greatly increase the spatial variability of HD characteristics across the region. These findings emphasize the complexity of WM effects on HD and the necessity for nuanced strategies in managing HD under WM influences."

We use variation in the timing and location of easements to estimate the impacts of WFCEs in Maine from a 33-year time-series of forest loss and harvesting. We find that WFCEs had negligible impacts on an already low rate of forest loss. Compared to matched control areas, easements decreased forest loss by 0.0004% yr−1 (95% CI: −0.0008, to −0.00003%) the equivalent of 3.17 ha yr−1 (95% C.I.: 1.6, to 6.7 ha yr−1) when scaled to the 839 142 ha of total conserved area. In contrast, WFCEs increased the rate of harvesting by 0.37% yr−1 (95% CI: 0.11%–0.63%), or 3,105 ha yr−1 (95% C.I.: 923–5,287 ha yr−1) when scaled to the conserved area. However, more recently established easements contained stricter restrictions on harvest practices and stricter easements reduced harvest by 0.66% yr−1 (95% CI: −1.03, −0.29).

This is assessed relative to the frequency of discussion of economic factors and health outcomes, and how this varies between countries based on political, economic, and environmental factors. Using natural language processing, a dictionary-based automated content analysis was conducted of the frequency of terms within these reports. Correlation analyses examined the relationship between the frequency of dictionary categories and political, economic, and environmental variables to ascertain the role of contextual factors. Overall, NDCs were found to feature a greater proportion of economic language compared to health outcome and SDPHE terms. Among the SDPHE, equity- and gender-related terms occurred most frequently. Correlations were identified primarily among high-income countries, that suggest moderate positive associations between levels of CO2 emissions per capita and per dollar of gross domestic product and the use of economic terms, and a negative association of economic language with levels of democracy. Democracy was also positively associated with language related to social norms such as equity and justice, indicating potential scope for impact through democratic pressures. The relatively frequent use of economic frames in NDCs suggests that economic issues may receive more attention compared to the SDPHE. This analysis identifies potential enabling and constraining country-level factors for greater attention to the SDPHE in NDCs and more progressive climate change mitigation policymaking."

The additional effects of these mECEs on crop yield, particularly considering various types of ECEs and regional scales, remain poorly understood. To close this knowledge gap, we consider droughts, pluvials, heatwaves, and coldwaves, and further identify which types of compound events have additional effects on winter wheat yield in France, using statistical methods and datasets encompassing 94 counties over a 68-year period. Our results indicate co-occurring drought heatwaves in summer and spring, along with co-occurring pluvial heatwaves and pluvial coldwaves in winter, have negative additional effects on yield compared with single ECEs. We further identify the types of mECEs that have intensified effects, with the majority showing negative effects on yield. Key interactions leading to intensified yield loss include droughts in winter or spring combined with summer co-occurring drought heatwaves, pluvials across multiple growth stages, pluvials combined with coldwaves, and the transition between droughts and pluvials, with the most severe anomaly attaining −17.2%. Coldwaves are the main ECE related to intensified yield increases, while their frequency is decreasing.

In the last two decades alone, many applied studies have aimed at investigating the ‘value’ of socio-environmental outcomes from the perspectives of the general populations including Indigenous Peoples. The term ‘value’ is often invoked in varying contexts ranging from empirical research to natural resource management (NRM) strategies and policies. Underpinning all valuation exercises is a conceptual approach to defining and analysing value, which is contextual given that different philosophies and worldviews consider nature’s ‘value’ differently. Our objective was to understand value philosophies underpinning diverse NRM ‘value’ paradigms and to evaluate compatibility with Indigenous Peoples’ value attribution. We conducted a systematic search for publications on nature studies from multiple databases using a Boolean strategy. The processes for literature identification and selection are presented in a PRISMA flowchart. The study then critically reviewed and synthesized insights from the literature on the interpretations, conceptualizations, and elicitations of value, particularly in contexts where NRM influences Indigenous estates. We found that philosophical perspectives define how ‘value’ is conceptualised and evaluated. Most studies reviewed rested on the economic paradigm grounded in anthropocentric utilitarian value-framing, and limited studies considered a relational value lens that reflects Indigenous Peoples’ value attribution for the natural environment. A relational lens sits outside of the usual ‘instrumental versus intrinsic’ value dichotomy and deems human-nature connections coupled, and worthy in themselves. The paper demonstrates the commonalities and inconsistencies across diverse value conceptualizations and describes emerging pluralistic approaches consistent with Indigenous value attribution. A novel framework for understanding and bridging the different conceptual and analytical valuation lenses, particularly on water, is presented ensuring that multiple, complex, and distinct value dimensions are empirically bridged in studies involving Indigenous Peoples."

This program, mainly situated in arid and semi-arid regions, critically focuses on improving water use efficiency (WUE)—maximizing carbon sequestration per unit of water consumed—as a key strategy for optimizing water resource utilization and ensuring the long-term success of vegetation restoration efforts. However, the regulatory mechanisms of forest WUE in this region remain unclear. Here, we adopted an interpretative machine-learning method to investigate the influence of main environmental elements, topographical conditions, and stand characteristics on forest WUE in the TNSFP region from 2001 to 2022 based on remote sensing products, ground monitoring data, and forest inventory data. Our study identified soil moisture (SM) as the primary factor influencing forest WUE across the TNSFP region, with higher SM levels generally leading to improved WUE in forests. However, stand characteristics strongly mediated their relationship. Specifically, forest WUE initially increases against forest density before peaking at about 1000 trees hm−2 for needle-leaved forests (NLF) and 800 trees hm−2 for broad-leaved forests, respectively, then gradually declining due to water competition. When SM is relatively adequate, moderate thinning could significantly enhance forest WUE. Furthermore, implementing management strategies to improve WUE is crucial as NLFs mature. This study emphasizes the significant impacts of stand characteristics on forest WUE in the TNSFP region, offering essential insights for optimizing water resource management in managed forests across arid and semi-arid regions."

Compared to the raw projections, the observationally constrained fHD is reduced by 9.68%–18.74%, with uncertainty narrowed by 3.79%–10.66% under the high emission scenario. The highest decline of fHD is located in regions with low population and gross domestic product (GDP), and globally, population and GDP exposures to fHD are reduced by 6.02%–10.73% and 6.51%–12.03%, respectively. The observationally constrained fHD with lower uncertainty provides more reliable information for risk management under climate change."

Addressing this challenge, our study demonstrated that, under S0-rich conditions and without organic additives, sulfidogenic communities dominated by sulfur-disproportionating bacteria (SDB) can effectively remove Hg(II) and prevent MeHg production. Using various inocula, we successfully established biological sulfidogenic systems driven separately by SDB and SRB. Batch experiments revealed that SDB cultures completely removed Hg(II) from the solution as HgS. Remarkably, no MeHg production was observed in the SDB cultures, while an average concentration of 0.32 μg/L of MeHg was detected in the SRB cultures. The absence of MeHg production in the SDB cultures could be mainly attributed to the cultivation conditions that reshaped the microbial community, resulting in a rapid decline of SRB-dominated Hg-methylating microorganisms. Consequently, the average abundance of the hgcA gene was 28 times lower than the levels before cultivation. Additionally, we found that the enriched Dissulfurimicrobium sp. bin121 can produce biogenic sulfide through sulfur disproportionation but lacks the hgcA gene, rendering it incapable of methylating Hg. Overall, we propose a novel biotechnology driven by SDB that can safely and sustainably treat Hg-bearing wastewater."

However, risk assessment should be unbiased and focus on appropriate end points to avoid biased prescreening. Here, we developed an adverse biological outcome screening strategy based on nontargeted functional protein profiles in earthworm (Eisenia fetida) immune cells exposed to NSMoS2 and their ionic counterpart (Na2MoO4). Through this framework, the apoptosis-related processes with distinct mechanisms were rapidly identified and thoroughly validated phenotypically. Specifically, upon exposure to 50 μg Mo/mL Na2MoO4, cellular signaling and energy homeostasis were disrupted within the transcription–translation biological chain. The autophagic pathway was activated, which, together with energy deprivation, phenotypically induced significant autophagy that ultimately led to apoptosis. In contrast, NSMoS2, tested at the same concentration, caused a reprogramming of apoptotic gene and protein expressions. Transcriptome plasticity facilitated the endocytic-adaptive transcriptional profile characterized by cytoskeleton remodeling and lysosome organization/movement under NSMoS2 exposure. Subcellular dynamics further revealed NSMoS2-induced lysosomal damage with a time-sensitive physiological window, ultimately mediating apoptosis. These findings provide a mechanistic and visual understanding of the distinct risk profile of NSMoS2 compared to molybdate, highlighting the importance of integrating nontargeted screening and phenotypic validation in early risk warning."

An epidemiologic survey was conducted involving 318 community residents in Shanghai, China, to assess PFAS exposure levels. The relationship between PFAS exposure and five thyroid function indicators was analyzed using Bayesian Kernel Regression (BKMR) and Weighted Quantile Sum Regression (WQS). Ten effector genes related to PFAS and thyroid diseases were identified through the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) for bioinformatics analysis and pathways involved were explored through mediation analysis. In vivo validation of these effector genes was conducted using PCR, complemented by in vitro cellular experiments involving transcriptome sequencing and the construction of animal models to simulate mixed PFAS exposure in the general population. Mixed PFAS exposure was found to impact thyroid health primarily through pathways related to lipid metabolism in toxicogenomic studies and resulted in the upregulation of key genes associated with lipid metabolism in animal models.

Pd/SiC-MR displays high efficiency and selectivity toward removal of multiple pollutants. For instance, rapid (∼0.35 s) and exclusive hydrogenation (>99%) of carbon-chlorine bond in organohalogens were realized at high water flux (220 L/m2/h). More importantly, the two-phase Pd/SiC-MR reaction system achieved 31.4% utilization of hydrogen reagent, 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than those by classical slurry or fixed-bed reactor. The high hydrogenation performance is attributed to the close proximity of the hydrogen source, reactive hydrogen atom, and pollutant under high molecular collision frequency in membrane pores.

Here, we investigated these mechanisms with Comamonas testosteroniKF-1, a wastewater isolate, by combining microscopy, spectroscopy, proteomics, protein modeling, and genetic engineering. Compared to minor dents on PET films, scanning electron microscopy revealed significant fragmentation of PET pellets, resulting in a 3.5-fold increase in the abundance of small nanoparticles (<100 nm) during 30-day cultivation. Infrared spectroscopy captured primarily hydrolytic cleavage in the fragmented pellet particles. Solution analysis further demonstrated double hydrolysis of a PET oligomer, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, to the bioavailable monomer terephthalate. Supplementation with acetate, a common wastewater co-substrate, promoted cell growth and PET fragmentation. Of the multiple hydrolases encoded in the genome, intracellular proteomics detected only one, which was found in both acetate-only and PET-only conditions. Homology modeling of this hydrolase structure illustrated substrate binding analogous to reported PET hydrolases, despite dissimilar sequences. Mutants lacking this hydrolase gene were incapable of PET oligomer hydrolysis and had a 21% decrease in PET fragmentation; re-insertion of the gene restored both functions. Thus, we have identified constitutive production of a key PET-degrading hydrolase in wastewater Comamonas, which could be exploited for plastic bioconversion."

Solar-powered submersible water pumping systems are versatile technology that help address community drinking water, irrigation, and electricity needs. Stakeholders external to the community, particularly solar photovoltaic experts, are vital in ensuring continued system services; however, there has been no comprehensive assessment of different solar-powered water pumping system support efforts. This review is the first to systematically evaluate external support for solar-powered systems from multiple regions and implementing organizations. We reviewed solar-powered water pumping system literature to identify implemented external support and factors that affect implementation. Publication databases, organization Web sites, and citations were searched. Seventy-four studies were included and evaluated using inductive coding and thematic synthesis. We derived a framework that organized support activities and factors into three nested levels of implementation: system, program, and sector. For support efforts implemented after 2010, most support providers worked at all levels. Each provider type worked at levels aligned with their knowledge and resources and complementary to other providers’ work. Drivers of support specific to solar-powered water systems were the existence of solar photovoltaic markets and infrastructure, support providers experienced with solar photovoltaics, and government and community solar advocates. We grouped support factors that study authors associated with system functionality into four categories: location and quality of support, reliability of support arrangements, frequency and timeliness of support, and policy and regulatory environment. No study outlined support for multiple uses of the systems or end-of-lifecycle care of solar panels. Solar-powered water pumping systems provide multiple community services, and their management will be bolstered by support providers collaborating to optimally apply their skill sets and create support plans that comprehensively address system versatility."

Machine learning models based on MIEs can predict complex toxic end points due to chemical exposure and improve the interpretability of models. In this study, a system was constructed that integrated six MIEs associated with adipogenesis and obesity. This system showed high accuracy in external validation, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78. Molecular hydrophobicity (SlogP_VSA) and direct electrostatic interactions (PEOE_VSA) were identified as the two most critical molecular descriptors representing the obesogenic potential of chemicals. This system was further used to predict the obesogenic effects of chemicals on the candidate list of substances of very high concern (SVHCs). Results from 3T3-L1 adipogenesis assays verified that the system correctly predicted obesogenic or nonobesogenic effects of 10 of the 12 SVHCs tested, and identified four novel potential obesogens, including 2-benzotriazol-2-yl-4,6-ditert-butylphenol (UV-320), 4-(1,1,5-trimethylhexyl)phenol (p262-NP), 2-[4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenoxy]ethanol (OP1EO) and endosulfan.

Developing catalysts simultaneously with excellent water resistance and a high intermediate suppression ability is still a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a simple strategy to synthesize a Pd/CoOOH catalyst that contains abundant hydroxyl groups and lattice oxygen species, over which a negligible effect was observed on CH3OH conversion with 3 vol % water vapor, while a remarkable conversion reduction of 24% was observed over Pd/Co3O4. Moreover, the low-temperature CO2 selectivity over Pd/CoOOH is significantly enhanced in comparison with Pd/Co(OH)2. The high concentration of surface hydroxyl groups on Pd/CoOOH enhances the water resistance owing to the accelerated activation of H2O to generate Co–OH, which replaces the consumed hydroxyl and facilitates the quick dissociation of surface H2O through timely desorption. Additionally, the presence of Pd–Olatt–Co promotes electron transport from Co to Pd, leading to improved metal–support interactions and weakened metal–O bonds. This in turn enhances the catalyst’s capacity to efficaciously convert intermediates. This study sheds new insights into designing multifunctional catalytic platforms for efficient industrial OVOC purification as well as other heterogeneous oxidation reactions."

It should be noted that the classification is almost insensitive to the time period but mainly depends on the percentage of different blocking events. The spatial distributions of cold surges differ substantially among these eight regimes. Due mainly to the cold advection downstream of the centers of blocking activities, cold surges can be observed over parts of the Eurasian continent.

Although previous studies have explored the broad impacts of urbanization on TCs, the effect of heterogeneity caused by local intra‐urban variability has not been examined. To address this gap, this study utilized the urban Local Climate Zone (LCZ) to capture the urban landscape heterogeneity and the impacts of this representation on the simulation of the post‐landfall TCs characteristics in Houston. Taking the case of two recent TCs: Hurricane Harvey (occurred in 2017) and Tropical Storm Imelda (occurred in 2019), the study evaluated the impact of urban heterogeneity on 10‐m winds, 2‐m temperature, land surface temperature, and precipitation across Houston. The consideration of intra‐urban heterogeneity using LCZ can improve the 10‐m winds, 2‐m temperature, and spatial pattern of land surface temperature. Although the cumulative rainfall remained largely similar within the experiments (with and without LCZ), incorporating intra‐urban heterogeneity notably modified the spatial structure of urban rainfall, particularly in simulating heavy rainfall hot spots. These findings are consistent for both TCs and demonstrate the positive impact of incorporating intra‐urban heterogeneity on the landfalling TC simulations over the Houston area."

 In mice, intestinal tuft cells have been described as a long-lived, postmitotic cell type. Two distinct subsets have been identified: tuft-1 and tuft-2 (ref. 1). By combining analysis of primary human intestinal resection material and intestinal organoids, we identify four distinct human tuft cell states, two of which overlap with their murine counterparts. We show that tuft cell development depends on the presence of Wnt ligands, and that tuft cell numbers rapidly increase on interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 exposure, as reported previously in mice2–4. This occurs through proliferation of pre-existing tuft cells, rather than through increased de novo generation from stem cells. Indeed, proliferative tuft cells occur in vivo both in fetal and in adult human intestine. Single mature proliferating tuft cells can form organoids that contain all intestinal epithelial cell types. Unlike stem and progenitor cells, human tuft cells survive irradiation damage and retain the ability to generate all other epithelial cell types. Accordingly, organoids engineered to lack tuft cells fail to recover from radiation-induced damage. Thus, tuft cells represent a damage-induced reserve intestinal stem cell pool in humans. Four distinct tuft cell states are identified by combining analysis of primary human intestinal resection material and organoids, and studying tuft cell development shows that they represent a damage-induced reserve intestinal stem cell pool in humans."

In vivo studies indicate that the mixed targeting nanoplatform elicits tumor ICD, dendritic cell maturation, TAM polarization, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration and inhibits melanoma volume growth. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade, the survival time of mice is markedly prolonged. This study provides a strategy for utilizing immunoactive materials in the innate and adaptive immune responses to augment cancer therapy. Cancer immunotherapy leans on the effective activation on immune response within tumors and surrounding immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, the authors report a triblock copolymeric nanocarrier encapsulating Resiquimod for B16F10 cell-targeting, which enables in situ tumor vaccination and tumor-associated macrophages polarization."

Here, the authors demonstrate its occurrence in Ba2MgReO6, a 5d1 double perovskite, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, thermodynamic measurements and quantum chemistry calculations. 
 Exotic quantum phases, arising from a complex interplay of charge, spin, lattice and orbital degrees of freedom, are of immense interest to a wide research community. A well-known example of such an entangled behavior is the Jahn-Teller effect, where the lifting of orbital degeneracy proceeds through lattice distortions. Here we demonstrate that a highly-symmetrical 5d1 double perovskite Ba2MgReO6, comprising a 3D array of isolated ReO6 octahedra, represents a rare example of a dynamic Jahn-Teller system in the strong spin-orbit coupling regime. Thermodynamic and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering experiments, supported by quantum chemistry calculations, undoubtedly show that the Jahn-Teller instability leads to a ground-state doublet, resolving a long-standing puzzle in this family of compounds. The dynamic state of ReO6 octahedra persists down to the lowest temperatures, where a multipolar order sets in, allowing for investigations of the interplay between a dynamic JT effect and strongly correlated electron behavior.

 Chronic pain remains a significant medical challenge with complex underlying mechanisms, and an urgent need for new treatments. Our research built and utilized the iPain single-cell atlas to study chronic pain progression in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. We discovered that senescence of a small subset of pain-sensing neurons may be a driver of chronic pain. This mechanism was observed in animal models after nerve injury and in human patients diagnosed with chronic pain or diabetic painful neuropathy. Notably, treatment with senolytics, drugs that remove senescent cells, reversed pain symptoms in mice post-injury. These findings highlight the role of cellular senescence in chronic pain development, demonstrate the therapeutic potential of senolytic treatments, and underscore the value of the iPain atlas for future pain research.

Here, the authors show that chronic stress induces a disruption of excitation-inhibition balance in mouse MPOA, leading to depression-like states. 
 Dysregulation of brain homeostasis is associated with neuropsychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder. However, underlying neural-circuit mechanisms remain not well-understood. We show in mice that chronic restraint stress (CRS) and social defeat stress (SDS) are both associated with disruption of excitation (E)-inhibition (I) balance, with increased E/I ratios, in medial preoptic area (MPOA) circuits, but through affecting different neuronal types. CRS results in elevated activity in glutamatergic neurons, and their suppression mitigates CRS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Paraventricular hypothalamic input to these neurons contributes to induction but not expression of depressive-like behaviors. Their projections to ventral tegmental area and periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe suppress midbrain dopaminergic and serotonergic activity, respectively, and mediate expression of divergent depressive-like symptoms. By contrast, SDS results in reduced activity of GABAergic neurons, and their activation alleviates SDS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Thus, E/I imbalance with relatively increased excitation in MPOA circuits may be a general mechanism underlying depression caused by different etiological factors. Whether excitatory and inhibitory neural populations in the medial preoptic area of hypothalamus (MPOA) respond differentially under different chronic stress conditions is not fully understood.

 Rapid warming in the Arctic threatens to amplify climate change by releasing the region’s vast stocks of soil carbon to the atmosphere. Increased nutrient availability may exacerbate soil carbon losses by stimulating microbial decomposition or offset them by increasing primary productivity. The outcome of these competing feedbacks remains unclear. Here we present results from a long-term nutrient addition experiment in northern Alaska, United States, coupled with a mechanistic isotope-tracing experiment. We found that soil carbon losses observed during the first 20 years of fertilization were caused by microbial priming and were completely reversed in the subsequent 15 years by shrub expansion which promoted an increasingly efficient carbon–nitrogen economy. Incorporating long-term stoichiometric responses in Earth system models will improve predictions of the magnitude, direction and timing of the Arctic carbon–climate feedback.

This study evaluates historical records to show that oyster reefs were once a dominant feature of European coastlines and provides perspectives for current management strategies. 
 Anthropogenic activities have impacted marine ecosystems at extraordinary scales. Biogenic reef ecosystems built by the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) typically declined before scientific monitoring. The past form and extent of these habitats thus remains unknown, with such information potentially providing valuable perspectives for current management and policy. Collating >1,600 records published over 350 years, we created a map of historical oyster reef presence at the resolution of 10 km2 across its biogeographic range, including documenting abundant reef habitats along the coasts of France, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Spatial extent data were available from just 26% of locations yet totalled >1.7 million hectares (median reef size = 29.9 ha, range 0.01–1,536,000 ha), with 190 associated macrofauna species from 13 phyla described. Our analysis demonstrates that oyster reefs were once a dominant three-dimensional feature of European coastlines, with their loss pointing to a fundamental restructuring and ‘flattening’ of coastal and shallow-shelf seafloors. This unique empirical record demonstrates the highly degraded nature of European seas and provides key baseline context for international restoration commitments.

 Current climate models suggested that Antarctic sea ice cover would decrease substantially under cumulative CO2 emission, but little is known whether large decrease in Antarctic sea ice can influence the occurrence of strong El Niño. Using time slice coupled and uncoupled model experiments, we show that in response to half reduction of Antarctic sea ice projected near the end of the 21st century, the frequency of strong El Niño would be increased by ~40%. It is contributed by enhanced thermocline, Ekman, and zonal advective positive feedbacks that are partly offset by enhanced thermodynamic damping. The strong warming and weakened westerly winds in the southeastern Pacific generate an anomalous Rossby wave propagating into the eastern subtropical and tropical Pacific, favoring stronger El Nino, and air-sea coupling and ocean feedbacks play a critical role in the teleconnection. Unexpectedly, compare to halved Antarctic sea ice, the ice-free Antarctic leads to a decrease in the frequency of strong El Niño, which is largely due to a substantial increase in thermodynamic damping. We also show that a large portion of the increase of strong El Niño events under greenhouse warming might be connected with Antarctic sea-ice loss, though increased greenhouse gas plays an important role."

 After the middle Miocene Climate transition, global cooling caused substantial hydrological changes in East Asia. Today, many lines of evidence indicate that inland East Asia experienced persistent aridification after the middle Miocene Climate transition. However, chemical weathering records from the South China Sea as well as late-Miocene paleolake expansions in northeastern Tibet contrast with the idea of long-term aridification after the middle Miocene Climate transition. Here, we present manganese-to-iron ratios and clay mineral contents of sediments formed approximately 14 to 10 million years ago from the Guide Basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, combined with previously published records (lithology, magnetic susceptibility, redness, and strontium content). Our results show that a paleolake in the Guide Basin expanded between approximately 11.4 and 10.5 million years ago, opposite to the long-term drying trend after the middle Miocene Climate transition. On the 100-kilo-year eccentricity scale, our results demonstrate alternating moisture source variability in northeast Tibet, with precipitation predominantly delivered via the westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon. This variability could potentially be related to the movement of the westerly jet over the Tibetan Plateau. After comparison to climate model simulations, we attribute this movement to astronomical forcing and the waxing and waning of the Antarctic ice sheet.

 Transforming the agri-food system from a “take-make-waste”, or linear production system, to a circular bioeconomy that reduces, recycles, recovers, reuses, and regenerates wastes and transitions from fossil to biobased fuels and products is being hailed as critical for meeting a growing population’s food and fuel needs in environmentally sustainable ways. While a transformation towards a circular bioeconomy is an appealing strategy to achieve multiple environmental goals, we argue that this strategy needs to go beyond a techno-centric focus and adopt an economic value-based lens to balance the desire for circularity with its costs, benefits, and distributional effects on society. This perspective analyzes the mechanisms that sustain the existing linear economy and proposes a novel social cost-benefit framework to determine the optimal level and path to circularity. We present five critical pathways to achieve a sustainable circular bioeconomy in a market economy consisting of decentralized decision-makers.

 Irrigation profoundly impacts ecology and agricultural productivity, with irrigated areas varying across regions and years.

We analyzed the response of irrigated areas to drought conditions in areas equipped for irrigation and used the derived relationships to estimate annual irrigated areas for 32 European countries in the period 1990–2020. Interannual variability of irrigated areas varied notably, particularly in more humid Northern and Western Europe. In most humid regions, irrigated area is larger in dry years, whereas in more arid regions like Spain, it is larger in wet years.

 Marine heatwaves are events of extreme warming in the ocean and have devastating consequences for marine life. Here we used a K-mean clustering analysis to detect different types of marine heatwaves along the South American coast from 10°S to 45°S and identify their remote drivers. In the central part of the domain, marine heatwaves are associated with atmospheric blocking caused by wave trains triggered by the Madden-Julian Oscillation. On the other hand, marine heatwaves occurring along the northern and southern coast of South America are associated with El Niño and La Niña events, respectively. The intensity and duration of these marine heatwaves are modulated by the development phase and intensity of the Niño and Niña events. By identifying the climatic modes of variability leading to each type of marine heatwaves, our study can help develop adaptation strategies, such as early warning systems, to prevent the devastating effects of marine heatwaves.

 The Nadir Crater offshore West Africa is a recently proposed near K-Pg impact structure identified on 2D seismic. Here we present 3D seismic data that image this crater in exceptional detail, unique for any such structure, which demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that the crater-forming mechanism was a hypervelocity impact. Seismic mapping reveals a near-circular crater rim of 9.2 km and an outer brim of ~23 km diameter defined by concentric normal faults. An extended damage zone is evident across the region, well beyond the perceived limit of subsurface deformation for impact craters, except in a ‘sheltered zone’ to the east. The paleo-seabed shows evidence for widespread liquefaction because of seismic shaking, and scars and gullies formed by tsunami wave propagation and resurge. Deformation within the ~425 m high stratigraphic uplift and annular moat allows us to reconstruct the evolution of the crater, with radial thrusts at the periphery of the uplift suggesting a low-angle impact from the east. Structural relationships are used to reconstruct the deformation processes during the crater modification stage, with the central uplift forming first, followed by centripetal flow of surrounding sediments into the evacuated crater floor in the seconds to minutes after impact. A 9.2 km diameter rim, concentric normal faults and an extended damage zone are observed in 3-dimensional seismic reflection data from the Nadir crater offshore Western Africa and provide strong evidence for an impact origin."

 Abiotic synthesis of methanethiol through CO2 reduction is a presumptive initiation reaction of protometabolism in primordial ocean hydrothermal systems. However, reported artificial means of methanethiol production indicate the necessity of gas-phase condition, rather than aqueous-phase setting, for this prebiotic reaction to occur. Here we show that, under supercritical CO2 with a geochemically feasible concentration of hydrogen, up to 7.9% conversion of hydrogen sulfide to methanethiol is attained through a 14-day reaction at 200 °C on molybdenum sulfide catalyst deposited in a carbonate-NaCl solution. On the present ocean floor, discharges of liquid/supercritical CO2 occasionally occur in close vicinity to hydrothermal vents. Geological records of ancient seafloor suggest prevalence of such CO2 fluxes associated with hydrothermal activities. Our experimental results link these facts with the protometabolism scenario, leading to the possibility that the generation and transportation of methanethiol through the subseafloor CO2 fluxes constituted the beginning step of protometabolism in primordial ocean hydrothermal systems. Thus, the supply of supercritical-CO2-derived materials likely assisted the chemical evolution of life in combination with the known geochemical processes at the vent-ocean interface.

 Phenolic compounds (PC) are important secondary metabolites in plants, playing a crucial role in plant defense mechanisms against pathogens and other plants. Monitoring PC levels is important for understanding tree stress and implementing effective breeding programs. However, traditional methods for monitoring PC are time-consuming, prone to altering the phenolic composition, and mostly applicable only on a small scale. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) multispectral imaging in estimating the canopy phenolic content in slash pine over an 11-month period in 2021 and a seven-month period in 2022. Three machine learning models including Partial least squares regression (PLSR), Random forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared to determine the optimal predictive model for canopy PC. The RF model provided the best predictive results, with R2 values of 0.82 for the validation set and 0.94 for the calibration set. Additionally, the study assesses the heritable variation in canopy PC over time, with the monthly heritability (h2) of PC ranging from 0 to 0.26 in 2021 and from 0 to 0.35 in 2022; The highest h2 levels were observed in July and September 2021and July 2022. The findings demonstrate significant genetic control over the variation of PC. Furthermore, we observed higher breeding values and genetic gains in July and November, which further supports the strong correlation between PC and environmental factors such as temperature and light intensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ time-series UAV multispectral imaging to predict secondary metabolites in pine trees and estimate their genetic variation over time. As a proof of concept, these findings provide more reliable information for tree breeding programs, ultimately enhancing their overall performance."

The response maps onto the Arctic Oscillation and is strongest in the North Atlantic, where it resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Unexpectedly, these 1-year lagged teleconnections are at least as strong as the better-known simultaneous winter connections. However, the 1-year lagged response is oppositein sign to the simultaneous response such that 1 year later, El Niño is followed by a positive NAO, whereas La Niña is followed by a negative NAO. The lagged response may also interfere with simultaneous ENSO teleconnections. We show here that these effects are unlikely to be caused by residual aliasing of ENSO cycles; rather, slowly migrating atmospheric angular momentum anomalies explain both the sign and the timing of the extratropical response. Our results have implications for understanding ENSO teleconnections, explaining observed extratropical climate variability and interpreting seasonal to interannual climate predictions."

Although NR5A2 plays a minor but measurable role during zygotic genome activation, it predominantly acts as a master regulator at the eight-cell stage, controlling expression of lineage-specifying TFs and genes involved in mitosis, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair.

10.1126/science.adn7179,False,Science,这篇论文研究的是真菌蚂蚁农业的协同进化，主要关注真菌和蚂蚁之间的共生关系，以及这种关系的演化历史。论文使用基因组数据构建了真菌和蚂蚁的进化树，并分析了它们之间的相互作用。研究发现，真菌蚂蚁农业起源于6600万年前的白垩纪末期，当时小行星撞击地球导致全球性大灭绝，但有利于真菌的繁衍。随后，大约2700万年前，一种祖先真菌培养种群被驯化，即成为专性互利共生关系，这可能是由于南美洲季节性干旱栖息地的扩展，导致培养种群与自由生活的湿润森林栖息地同种群隔离。这项研究揭示了真菌蚂蚁协同进化的主要转变，阐明了塑造非人类农业模式系统的历史过程。,[],"Ted R.

Doyle",The coevolution of fungus-ant agriculture,"Fungus-farming ants cultivate multiple lineages of fungi for food, but, because fungal cultivar relationships are largely unresolved, the history of fungus-ant coevolution remains poorly known. We designed probes targeting >2000 gene regions to generate a dated evolutionary tree for 475 fungi and combined it with a similarly generated tree for 276 ants. We found that fungus-ant agriculture originated ~66 million years ago when the end-of-Cretaceous asteroid impact temporarily interrupted photosynthesis, causing global mass extinctions but favoring the proliferation of fungi. Subsequently, ~27 million years ago, one ancestral fungal cultivar population became domesticated, i.e., obligately mutualistic, when seasonally dry habitats expanded in South America, likely isolating the cultivar population from its free-living, wet forest–dwelling conspecifics. By revealing these and other major transitions in fungus-ant coevolution, our results clarify the historical processes that shaped a model system for nonhuman agriculture."

We show that DRT2 systems encode an unprecedented immune pathway that involves de novo gene synthesis through rolling circle reverse transcription of a noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Programmed template jumping on the ncRNA generates a concatemeric cDNA, which becomes double-stranded upon viral infection. This DNA product constitutes a protein-coding, nearly endless open reading frame (neo) gene whose expression leads to potent cell growth arrest, restricting the viral infection. Our work highlights an elegant expansion of genome coding potential through RNA-templated gene creation and challenges conventional paradigms of genetic information encoded along the one-dimensional axis of genomic DNA."

The promise of cancer immunotherapy is that immune effector mechanisms and immunological memory can jointly eradicate cancers and inoperable metastases and de facto vaccinate against recurrence. For some patients with hitherto incurable diseases, including metastatic melanoma, this promise is being realized by game-changing immunotherapies based on αβ T cells. Today’s challenges are to bring benefit to greater numbers of patients of diverse ethnicities, target more cancer types, and achieve a cure while incurring fewer adverse events. In meeting those challenges, specific benefits may be offered by γδ T cells, which compose a second T cell lineage with distinct recognition capabilities and functional traits that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. γδ T cell–based clinical trials, including off-the-shelf adoptive cell therapy and agonist antibodies, are yielding promising results, although identifiable problems remain. In addressing those problems, we advocate that immunotherapies be guided by the distinctive biology of γδ T cells, as elucidated by ongoing research."

The GDP/capita pathways are modifications of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway SSP1 scenario, including one post-growth future for high-income countries and higher growth for all currently lower-income countries. Current inequality levels, together with the total national income from the GDP pathways, determine the inequality reductions required to eradicate poverty in individual countries; they are based on a methodology that specifies the relationship between poverty, inequality, and growth. Our pathways show rapid and sustained reductions in within-country inequality (Gini), even with high economic growth. The speed of redistribution is limited to the highest historically observed changes in inequality. We identify which countries face the greatest difficulties in meeting their poverty eradication targets and estimate the level of international transfers needed to fill the gap for those countries. Our findings reconfirm the importance of reducing within-country inequality in eradicating global poverty."

Despite China’s recent rise as major public finance provider for the electricity sector of the developing world and the related environmental impacts, there is limited knowledge of the extent and characteristics of non-Chinese participation in Chinese-funded projects. We apply complexity theory approaches and network modeling on a new dataset that links funding activities of developmental institutions (Chinese developmental institutions (CDIs), Western-backed multilateral development banks (MDBs)) and the involvement of companies in different roles (i.e., as direct investors, contractors, equipment suppliers, and other service providers) to power plants around the world at the unit-level (1999–2020). Previous literature suggests that CDI funded projects show preference to Chinese commercial partners, but we find more than 70% include non-Chinese participants. This also applies for fossil-fuel based technologies where we observe increasing shares of international actors that together account for nearly every third commercial linkage. However, involvement levels and interaction patterns not only differ by technologies (fossils, hydro, non-hydro renewable, nuclear) but also by the time period and types of commercial partners and we observe overall convergence between the CDI- and MDB-supported power plant networks over time. The decreasing involvement of Chinese companies in CDI-funded projects, across technologies, in favor of increasing Western involvement, has important implications for development and climate policy on which we elaborate. However, the failure of both MDB and CDI funding to promote domestic company involvement in the recipient countries may be the largest failing of both sets of agencies in the pursuit of development outcomes."

Although, many studies have assessed effects of infrastructure on the overall biodiversity, these were often restricted in scope, by assessing only a particular type of infrastructure, such as coastal defence structures, or by focusing solely on diversity metrics. Therefore, we still have little knowledge on the functional impacts of infrastructure, in general, on coastal habitats. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the functional composition of natural and artificial marine habitats. We analysed a total of 68 publications from 26 countries, with data collected between 1995–2019. We found up to 60% more habitat-forming algae on natural habitats than on infrastructure at most tidal heights, but no differences were found when looking at all species of macro-algal, i.e. including non-habitat-formers. In contrast, we found more habitat-forming filter feeders, such as oysters and mussels, on subtidal vertical and floating structures, such as pylons and pontoons, respectively, than on natural habitats. Differences on the abundance of grazers varied with tidal height and/or the type of infrastructure. For example, in the subtidal, grazers were significantly more abundant on natural boulders than on infrastructure, while at low tidal heights, we found significantly less grazers on artificial floating structures and on vertical structures than on natural habitats. With coastal development on the rise, these differences have significant implications for productivity, energy and nutrient flow in coastal systems. Our findings highlight the importance of adopting a functional approach to have a more holistic understanding on the environmental impacts associated to marine urbanisation and thus better inform management and restoration efforts."

This study explored the role of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) in EHDPP-induced lipid metabolic disturbances. We examined EHDPP’s binding affinity and transcriptional impact on AdipoR1. AdipoR1 knockdown (AdipoR1kd) human liver cells and coculture experiments with AdipoR1 activator (AdipoRon) were used to investigate the effect and the mechanism. EHDPP disrupted triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis and altered corresponding gene expression, mirroring effects in AdipoR1kd cells but diminishing in EHDPP-treated AdipoR1kd cells. RNA sequencing revealed that EHDPP primarily disrupted oxidative phosphorylation and insulin signaling dependent on AdipoR1. Mechanistically, EHDPP interacted with AdipoR1 and reduced AdipoR1 protein levels at 10–7 mol/L or higher, weakening the activation of the calmodulin dependent protein kinase β (CaMKKβ)/AMPK/acetyl CoA carboxylase pathway. Furthermore, EHDPP pretreatment blocked the increase in Ca2+ flux and the corresponding kinase CaMKKβ, as well as liver kinase B1 (LKB1) activation induced by AdipoRon, which is necessary for AMPK activation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that EHDPP-induced lipid imbalance is partially dependent on AdipoR1, expanding the understanding of environmental metabolic disruptors beyond nuclear receptors."

In the present study availability, accumulation, and transformation of C4- and C8-fluoroalkylsulfonamide (FASA)-based copolymers were assessed in laboratory-grown earthworms (Eisenia fetida, triplicate of exposure tests and control). Further, a field study on earthworms (18 pooled samples) in sludge-amended soil was conducted to assess the environmental impact of sludge-amended soil with regard to the FASA-based copolymers, together with the applied sludge (n = 3), and the field soils during the period (n = 4). In the laboratory study, the FASA-based copolymers were taken up by the earthworms in concentrations between 19 and 33 ng/g of dw for the C8- and between 767 and 1735 ng/g of dw for the C4-FASA-based copolymer. Higher biota soil accumulation factors (BAFs) were observed for the copolymer with a longer perfluorinated side-chain length (C8, average BAF value of 0.7) compared to the copolymer with a shorter side-chain length (C4, average BAF value of 0.02). Perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetates (FOSAAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), including both branched and linear isomers, were detected after exposure to the C8-FASA-based copolymer. Two metabolites were detected in the earthworms exposed to the C4-FASA-based copolymer: perfluorobutanesulfonamide (FBSA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). Although the presence of other monomers or impurities in the copolymer formulation cannot be ruled out, the present laboratory study suggests that the FASA-based copolymers may be an indirect source of lower molecular weight PFAS in the environment through transformation. Elevated levels of C8-FASA-based copolymer were found in the field sludge-amended soil compared to nontreated soil (32 versus 11 ng/g d.w.), and higher concentrations of PFAS in earthworms living in sludge-amended soil compared to nontreated soil (566 versus 103 ng/g d.w.) were observed. These findings imply that the application of sludge is a potential pathway of PFAS to the environment."

The chemical, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and microscopic data demonstrated that the U(VI)-sorbed schwertmannite underwent a rapid reductive dissolution and solid-phase transformation to goethite, during which the surface-sorbed U(VI) was partly reduced and mostly repartitioned to monomeric U(VI)/U(IV) complexes by carboxyl and phosphoryl ligands on biomass or organic substances. Furthermore, the microbial data suggest that these processes were likely driven by the consecutive developments of fermentative and sulfate- and iron- reducing microbial communities. In contrast, the U(VI)-sorbed jarosite only stimulated the growth of some fermentative communities and underwent very limited reductive dissolution and thus, remaining in its initial state with no detectable mineralogical transformation and solid-phase U reduction/repartitioning. Accordingly, these two biotic incubations did not induce increased risk of U reliberation to the aqueous phase. These findings have important implications for understanding the interactions of schwertmannite/jarosite with microbial communities and colinked behavior and fate of U following the establishment of reducing conditions in various acidic and U-rich settings."

Here, we investigated the effects of 50, 500, and 5000 μg/kg/d of PTC on glycolipid metabolism in mice following 8 weeks of administration via drinking water, with specific attention on brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) in addition to the liver. We found that along with the increased serum triglyceride level in the 5000 μg/kg/d group, small fatty vacuoles occurred in livers in all treatment groups, indicating lipid accumulation. No change in WAT was observed, but PTC caused BAT whitening, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, more unilocular adipocytes with enlarged lipid droplets, reduced UCP1 levels, and down-regulated Doi2 expression, and even the dose of 50 μg/kg/d was effective. Transcriptomic analysis revealed immune inhibition and circadian rhythm disturbance in BAT from the 5000 μg/kg/d group, which are in agreement with BAT whitening and inactivation. On employing the C3H10T1/2 cells in vitro, we found that PTC treatment concentration-dependently promoted lipid accumulation in brown adipocytes, along with altered expression of thermogenesis-related and circadian genes. Taken together, our study shows that low doses of PTC caused BAT whitening, calling for much attention to the new target by pollutants."

Childress,Compaction of Pressure-Driven Water Treatment Membranes: Real-Time Quantification and Analysis,"Water treatment membranes play crucial roles in applications such as desalination, wastewater treatment, and potable water reuse. In a prior study, we introduced a novel method, combining electrical impedance spectroscopy with dynamic mechanical analysis, to quantify single-layer homogeneous membrane compaction up to 12.5 psi. Now we extend the method’s capabilities to quantify real-time compaction of multilayer heterogeneous nanofiltration and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes up to 330 psi. Our findings demonstrate that membrane compaction does not solely occur in the support/backing layer. The air pockets between the polysulfone support and the polyester backing layers, which were not discussed previously, account for up to 18% and 14% of total membrane compaction for the nanofiltration and RO membranes. For the nanofiltration membrane, the majority of compaction (up to 45%) occurs in the void spaces of the backing layer, while for the RO membrane, the majority of compaction (up to 40%) occurs in the solid material of the backing layer. We also confirm, with experimental results, the importance of using compressive testing instead of tensile testing to accurately characterize compaction. Membrane fatigue is characterized by experimental trends including: increasing irrevocable compaction, increasing creep/instantaneous compaction ratios, and increasing strains in hysteresis experiments."

However, the partitioning of fluvial inorganic carbon (IC) between downstream transport and atmospheric evasion remains uncertain due to intricate hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes. Inspired by Budyko's hydrological work, this study introduces a dimensionless framework to identify critical factors in fluvial IC partitioning: the IC fraction in equilibrium with the atmosphere and the ratio of advection to evasion timescales. River catchment analyses and modeling reveal that the equilibrium ratio determines the fraction of IC stably transported downstream. The hydrodynamic‐driven timescale ratio determines the fate of out‐of‐equilibrium IC, with low‐order streams favoring atmospheric evasion and higher‐order streams promoting downstream transport. This framework provides a simple yet robust approach to predicting river carbon dynamics, with implications for land‐to‐ocean transport, fluvial emissions, and climate mitigation strategies such as enhanced weathering."

The plume reached the mesosphere, and the eruption excited a significant atmospheric Lamb wave, which forced the tsunami. The complicated tsunami waveforms due to ocean‐atmosphere coupling prevented inferring the force history of the excitation. To address this, we analyze ocean surface gravity waves (OSWs) from 15 to 40 mHz, which are decoupled from the Lamb wave due to their slower phase velocities. Modeling these OSWs, we infer that the excitation started at 4:00 UTC with an amplitude of 1010 $1{0}^{10}$ N and lasted for 5 hr, followed by a sub‐event at 8:40 UTC. The observations suggest an initial blowout of seawater above the summit and a subsequent outflow that excited a tsunami below 5 mHz.

Recently, a new type of magnetic reconnection, electron‐only reconnection without the coupling of ions, has been observed in various plasma environments. Standard reconnection typically has a reconnection outflow velocity of about one Alfvén speed. According to the scaling analysis, the electron outflow velocity is expected to be about one electron Alfvén speed in electron‐only reconnection. However, observations and simulations both find that the electron outflows are much slower than the electron Alfvén speed. In this letter, by performing two‐dimensional particle‐in‐cell simulations, we show that this is because ions play a role in electron‐only reconnection. The ions move slower than the electrons in the outflow direction, and such charge separation forms an in‐plane Hall electric field, which prevents the electrons from being accelerated to the electron Alfvén speed in electron‐only reconnection."

Similar improvements are found for Pangu‐Weather model forecasts initialized with the GraphCast‐derived optimal, suggesting that model error is an unimportant part of the perturbations. Eliminating small scales from the perturbations also yields similar forecast improvements.

Very negative δ15N values detected in Archean sediments, which are not observed in present‐day environments, have been attributed to the low efficiency of proto‐nitrogenases. Alternatively, variations in early atmospheric CO2 may also play a role. Here we examine the effects of CO2 concentrations on the biomass δ15N signatures of the diazotrophs Trichodesmium erythraeum and Crocosphaera watsonii, which utilize Mo‐Fe nitrogenase (the most common form of the enzyme). Our results show that these organisms produce biomass with δ15N values up to ∼3‰ lower under both decreased and elevated CO2 concentrations compared to modern levels (∼380 μatm). These deviations from modern CO2 levels reduce nitrogenase enzyme efficiency, leading to increased organismal isotopic fractionation during N2 fixation. This study offers an alternative explanation for the observed fluctuations in geological δ15N records and provides new insights into the past nitrogen cycle on Earth."

Extreme precipitation may become more frequent, with a nonlinear response relative to increasing global temperatures. However, these changes are geographically varied. This article maps probable changes to landslide hazard, as shown by a landslide hazard indicator (LHI) derived from downscaled precipitation and temperature. In order to capture the nonlinear response of slopes to extreme precipitation, a simple machine‐learning model was trained on a database of landslides across High Mountain Asia to develop a regional LHI. This model was applied to statistically downscaled data from the 30 members of the Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research large ensembles to produce a range of possible outcomes under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2‐4.5 and 5‐8.5. The LHI reveals that landslide hazard will increase in most parts of High Mountain Asia. Absolute increases will be highest in already hazardous areas such as the Central Himalaya, but relative change is greatest on the Tibetan Plateau. Even in regions where landslide hazard declines by year 2100, it will increase prior to the mid‐century mark. However, the seasonal cycle of landslide occurrence will not change greatly across High Mountain Asia. Although substantial uncertainty remains in these projections, the overall direction of change seems reliable. These findings highlight the importance of continued analysis to inform disaster risk reduction strategies for stakeholders across High Mountain Asia."

 The lower limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is an important feature of Earth’s climate system as it returns recently ventilated water to the deep ocean and is a major sink for anthropogenic carbon. The Deep Western Boundary Current—the primary component of the lower limb—flows southwards along the eastern flank of Greenland transporting dense water formed in the Nordic seas. Since 2014, the Deep Western Boundary Current has been continuously monitored at this location from a mooring array to observe the current’s velocity and hydrographic structure close to its source. Here we find that the Deep Western Boundary Current transport has decreased by 26% over the first six years of observations, due to (1) a thinning of the traditionally defined Deep Western Boundary Current layer (σθ > 27.8 kg m−3) from a known freshening signal propagating through the subpolar region (56%), and (2) weakening velocities (44%). Despite this decrease, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation has remained relatively steady over the same period. Ultimately, this difference is due to the methods used to define these two circulations. Finding such notably different trends for two seemingly dependent circulations raises the question of how to best define these transports.

 Anoxygenic phototrophic Fe(II) oxidizers (photoferrotrophs) are thought to have thrived in Earth’s ancient ferruginous oceans and played a primary role in the precipitation of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic (3.8–1.85-billion-year-old) banded iron formations (BIFs). The end of BIF deposition by photoferrotrophs has been interpreted as the result of a deepening of water-column oxygenation below the photic zone, concomitant with the proliferation of cyanobacteria. However, photoferrotrophs may have experienced competition from other anaerobic Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms, altering the formation mechanism of BIFs. Here we utilize microbial incubations to show that nitrate-reducing Fe(II) oxidizers metabolically outcompete photoferrotrophs for dissolved Fe(II). Moreover, both experiments and numerical modelling show that the nitrate-reducing Fe(II) oxidizers inhibit photoferrotrophy via the production of toxic intermediates. Four different photoferrotrophs, representing both green sulfur and purple non-sulfur bacteria, are susceptible to this toxic effect despite having genomic capabilities for nitric oxide detoxification. Indeed, despite nitric oxide detoxification mechanisms being ubiquitous in some groups of phototrophs at the genomic level (for example, Chlorobi and Cyanobacteria) it is likely that they would still be affected. We suggest that the production of reactive nitrogen species during nitrate-reducing Fe(II) oxidation in ferruginous environments may have inhibited the activity of photoferrotrophs in the ancient oceans and thus impeded their role in the precipitation of BIFs.

They specifically exert a strong control on the regional occurrence of weather extremes, such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation and prolonged dry spells, which are becoming increasingly frequent and severe. However, climate models struggle to accurately simulate large-scale circulation changes in the tropics and thus their consequences for regional weather and future climate. Here we use high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data from 1940 to 2022 to study the occurrence trends of weather patterns in the tropical Indo-Pacific region. We find that new large-scale synoptic situations that were rarely present before the 1990s have emerged in the Indo-Pacific, while some others that were prominent have disappeared. Those new synoptic situations are associated with an unusual proportion of heatwaves and extreme precipitation in the region. These weather patterns are physically consistent with a trend towards a stronger Pacific Walker circulation, wetter and warmer conditions in Southeast Asia and drier conditions in the equatorial Pacific. These changes cannot be fully explained by El Niño/Southern Oscillation and other relevant modes of interannual variability, and other factors such as global warming, aerosol forcing, external forcing mechanisms and nonlinear mode interactions may be contributing. Emerging weather patterns over recent decades are exacerbating extreme precipitation and heatwaves in the tropical Indo-Pacific region, according to a computation of trends in reanalysis data."

Here, the authors discover that SNHG26 interacts with ILF2, redirecting it from inflammatory genomic loci to the LAMB3 locus, thereby promoting wound healing. 
 The cell transition from an inflammatory phase to a subsequent proliferative phase is crucial for wound healing, yet the driving mechanism remains unclear. By profiling lncRNA expression changes during human skin wound healing and screening lncRNA functions, we identify SNHG26 as a pivotal regulator in keratinocyte progenitors underpinning this phase transition. Snhg26-deficient mice exhibit impaired wound repair characterized by delayed re-epithelization accompanied by exacerbated inflammation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis combined with gain-of-function and loss-of-function of SNHG26 in vitro and ex vivo reveals its specific role in facilitating inflammatory-to-proliferative state transition of keratinocyte progenitors. A mechanistic study unravels that SNHG26 interacts with and relocates the transcription factor ILF2 from inflammatory genomic loci, such as JUN, IL6, IL8, and CCL20, to the genomic locus of LAMB3. Collectively, our findings suggest that lncRNAs play cardinal roles in expediting tissue repair and regeneration and may constitute an invaluable reservoir of therapeutic targets in reparative medicine.

Here, the authors show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor ONECUT3 controls the differentiation of hypothalamic neurons through NAV2. 
 Acquisition of specialized cellular features is controlled by the ordered expression of transcription factors (TFs) along differentiation trajectories. Here, we find a member of the Onecut TF family, ONECUT3, expressed in postmitotic neurons that leave their Ascl1+/Onecut1/2+ proliferative domain in the vertebrate hypothalamus to instruct neuronal differentiation. We combined single-cell RNA-seq and gain-of-function experiments for gene network reconstruction to show that ONECUT3 affects the polarization and morphogenesis of both hypothalamic GABA-derived dopamine and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)+ glutamate neurons through neuron navigator-2 (NAV2). In vivo, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ONECUT3 in neonatal mice reduced NAV2 mRNA, as well as neurite complexity in Onecut3-containing neurons, while genetic deletion of Onecut3/ceh-48 in C. elegans impaired neurocircuit wiring, and sensory discrimination-based behaviors. Thus, ONECUT3, conserved across neuronal subtypes and many species, underpins the polarization and morphological plasticity of phenotypically distinct neurons that descend from a common pool of Ascl1+ progenitors in the hypothalamus. Neuronal maturation is controlled by an ordered expression of TFs during development. Here, the authors show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor ONECUT3 controls the differentiation of hypothalamic neurons through NAV2."

 Molecular ferroelectrics have made breakthrough progress in intrinsic piezoelectric response that can be on par with advanced inorganic piezoelectric ceramics. However, their successful applications in high-density energy harvesting and self-powered flexible devices have been great challenge, owing to the low elastic moduli, intrinsically brittle, and fracture proneness of such material systems under mechanical loading. Here, we have developed a flexible porous composite piezoelectric material by using soft thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and molecular ferroelectric materials. Benefiting from the porous structure of TPU, the flexible piezoelectric composites enable effectively large doping ratio (50%) of [Me3NCH2Cl]CdCl3 (TMCM-CdCl3) and highly efficient stress absorption, coupled with the excellent piezoelectric properties of TMCM-CdCl3, to realize a superior power density (636.9 µW cm−2 or 1273.9 µW cm−3). This output is 2000 times higher than that of flexible piezoelectric materials represented by poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). We believe that the outstanding performance of the porous composite piezoelectric material would pave a feasible way for real industrial applications of molecular ferroelectrics.

Here, the authors characterize the different cell types and states of the mouse uterine tube and identify transitional pre-ciliated cells as a cancer-prone cell state, which could be targeted therapeutically. 
 The distal region of the uterine (Fallopian) tube is commonly associated with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the predominant and most aggressive form of ovarian or extra-uterine cancer. Specific cell states and lineage dynamics of the adult tubal epithelium (TE) remain insufficiently understood, hindering efforts to determine the cell of origin for HGSC. Here, we report a comprehensive census of cell types and states of the mouse uterine tube. We show that distal TE cells expressing the stem/progenitor cell marker Slc1a3 can differentiate into both secretory (Ovgp1+) and ciliated (Fam183b+) cells. Inactivation of Trp53 and Rb1, whose pathways are commonly altered in HGSC, leads to elimination of targeted Slc1a3+ cells by apoptosis, thereby preventing their malignant transformation. In contrast, pre-ciliated cells (Krt5+, Prom1+, Trp73+) remain cancer-prone and give rise to serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas and overt HGSC. These findings identify transitional pre-ciliated cells as a cancer-prone cell state and point to pre-ciliation mechanisms as diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

 Ryanodine Receptor isoform 3 (RyR3) is a large ion channel found in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of many different cell types. Within the hippocampal region of the brain, it is found in dendritic spines and regulates synaptic plasticity. It controls myogenic tone in arteries and is upregulated in skeletal muscle in early development. RyR3 has a unique functional profile with a very high sensitivity to activating ligands, enabling high gain in Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Here we solve high-resolution cryo-EM structures of RyR3 in non-activating and activating conditions, revealing structural transitions that occur during channel opening. Addition of activating ligands yields only open channels, indicating an intrinsically high open probability under these conditions. RyR3 has reduced binding affinity to the auxiliary protein FKBP12.6 due to several sequence variations in the binding interface. We map disease-associated sequence variants and binding sites for known pharmacological agents. The N-terminal region contains ligand binding sites for a putative chloride anion and ATP, both of which are targeted by sequence variants linked to epileptic encephalopathy.

 Domestication – the artificial selection of wild species to obtain variants with traits of human interest – was integral to the rise of complex societies. The oversupply of food was probably associated with the formalization of food preservation strategies through microbial fermentation. While considerable literature exists on the antiquity of fermented food, only few eukaryotic microbes have been studied so far for signs of domestication, less is known for bacteria. Here, we tested if cheese starter cultures harbour typical hallmarks of domestication by characterising over 100 community samples and over 100 individual strains isolated from historical and modern traditional Swiss cheese starter cultures. We find that cheese starter cultures have low genetic diversity both at the species and strain-level and maintained stable phenotypic traits. Molecular clock dating further suggests that the evolutionary origin of the bacteria approximately coincided with the first archaeological records of cheese making. Finally, we find evidence for ongoing genome decay and pseudogenization via transposon insertion related to a reduction of their niche breadth. Future work documenting the prevalence of these hallmarks across diverse fermented food systems and geographic regions will be key to unveiling the joint history of humanity with fermented food microbes.

 One of the most captivating properties of polaritons is their capacity to confine light at the nanoscale. This confinement is even more extreme in two-dimensional (2D) materials. 2D polaritons have been investigated by optical measurements using an external photodetector. However, their effective spectrally resolved electrical detection via far-field excitation remains unexplored. This hinders their exploitation in crucial applications such as sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and optical spectrometry, banking on their potential for integration with silicon technologies. Herein, we present the electrical spectroscopy of polaritonic nanoresonators based on a high-quality 2D-material heterostructure, which serves at the same time as the photodetector and the polaritonic platform. Subsequently, we electrically detect these mid-infrared resonators by near-field coupling to a graphene pn-junction. The nanoresonators simultaneously exhibit extreme lateral confinement and high-quality factors.

 Anemia is highly prevalent globally, especially in young children in low-income countries, where it often overlaps with a high burden of diarrheal disease. Distribution of iron interventions (as supplements or iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders, MNPs) is a key anemia reduction strategy. Small studies in Africa indicate iron may reprofile the gut microbiome towards pathogenic species. We seek to evaluate the safety of iron and MNPs based on their effects on diversity, composition, and function of the gut microbiome in children in rural Bangladesh as part of a large placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of iron or MNPs given for 3 months (ACTRN12617000660381). In 923 infants, we evaluate the microbiome before, immediately following, and nine months after interventions, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics in a subset. We identify no increase in diarrhea with either treatment. In our primary analysis, neither iron nor MNPs alter gut microbiome diversity or composition. However, when not adjusting for multiple comparisons, compared to placebo, children receiving iron and MNPs exhibit reductions in commensal species (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus) and increases in potential pathogens, including Clostridium. These increases are most evident in children with baseline iron repletion and are further supported by trend-based statistical analyses.

 Climate change and inequality are critical and interrelated issues. Despite growing empirical evidence on the distributional implications of climate policies and climate risks, mainstream model-based assessments are often silent on the interplay between climate change and economic inequality. Here we fill this gap through an ensemble of eight large-scale integrated assessment models that belong to different economic paradigms and feature income heterogeneity. We quantify the distributional implications of climate impacts and of the varying compensation schemes of climate policies compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement. By 2100, climate impacts will increase inequality by 1.4 points of the Gini index on average. Maintaining global mean temperature below 1.5 °C reduces long-term inequality increase by two-thirds but increases it slightly in the short term. However, equal per-capita redistribution can offset the short-term effect, lowering the Gini index by almost two points. We quantify model uncertainty and find robust evidence that well-designed policies can help stabilize climate and promote economic inclusion.

 Prompt ElastoGravity Signals are light-speed gravity-induced signals recorded before the arrival of seismic waves. They have raised interest for early warning applications but their weak amplitudes close to the background seismic noise have questioned their actual potential for operational use. A deep-learning model has recently demonstrated its ability to mitigate this noise limitation and to provide in near real-time the earthquake magnitude (Mw). However, this approach was efficient only for large earthquakes (Mw ≥ 8.3) of known focal mechanism. Here we show unprecedented performance in full earthquake characterization using the dense broadband seismic network deployed in Alaska and Western Canada. Our deep-learning model provides accurate magnitude and focal mechanism estimates of Mw ≥ 7.8 earthquakes, 2 minutes after origin time (hence the tsunamigenic potential). Our results represent a major step towards the routine use of prompt elastogravity signals in operational warning systems, and demonstrate its potential for tsunami warning in densely-instrumented areas.

 Human activities and climate change substantially threaten coastal areas, impacting ecosystem functions, services, and human-wellbeing. Trace elements, from both natural and anthropogenic sources, can contaminate coastal regions, and at high concentrations may become toxic to marine biota. Climate change is likely to affect the sources, sinks and cycling of trace elements in coastal systems: for example, riverine runoff is set to increase as precipitation in the Arctic intensifies, and more frequent extreme floods are expected to activate previously deeply buried trace elements. Furthermore, changes in human activity under a warming climate, such as increased Arctic shipping and potential geoengineering projects such as ocean alkalinity enhancement, will likely introduce more trace elements to coastal ecosystems. Advancing our understanding of trace element cycling is at present limited by factors including lack of data coverage in the Global South, challenges in studying multi-stressor effects and ecosystem responses, lack of long-term data, and the difficulty in parametrizing robust models in coastal environments.

 The Loess Plateau in China is renowned for its dense gullies and complex terrain, with drastic changes primarily due to soil erosion and human activities, significantly affecting the evolution of the ecological environment. The complex terrains and dense vegetation make precise terrain measurement and modeling challenging. Although the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanning and photogrammetry technologies has improved data acquisition precision, relying solely on one remote sensing technology struggles with accurately extracting bare earth information. This study adopted a method that fuses UAV lidar scanning with aerial photogrammetric imagery, generating detailed lidar point cloud data that includes coordinate, reflectance, true color, and texture information to enhance data classifiability and interpretability. Subsequently, a point cloud classification model based on the Transformer architecture (Stratified Transformer) is introduced to intelligently complete the initial ground point cloud extraction in complex gully terrains. Further, to address residual non-ground noise in the initial ground point clouds, a new point cloud classification optimization algorithm (MDD, Multi-scale C2M Distance Difference) is proposed. This algorithm, based on the characteristics of discrete and non-continuous with the ground surface of the noisy point clouds, effectively eliminates the discrete noisy point clouds by analyzing the distances between the point clouds and TINs (Triangular Irregular Networks) of different scales and their differences. This study effectively addresses the technical challenges of ground point cloud extraction in the mixed environment of complex terrain and vegetation, solving the problem of precise terrain measurement and intelligent data processing in complex gully terrains, and offering new technical pathways for detecting geomorphological changes."

 Existing methods for matching multi-modal remote sensing images (MRSI) demonstrate considerable adaptability. However, high-precision matching for rectification remains challenging due to differing imaging mechanisms in cross-modal remote sensing images, leading to numerous non-repeated detailed feature points. Additionally, assuming linear transformations between images conflicts with the complex aberrations present in remote sensing images, limiting matching accuracy. This paper aims to elevate matching accuracy by implementing a detailed texture removal strategy that effectively isolates repeatable structural features. Subsequently, we construct a radiation-invariant similarity function within a generalized gradient framework for least-squares matching, specifically designed to mitigate nonlinear geometric and radiometric distortions across MRSIs. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets, employing substantial manual checkpoints, demonstrate that our method significantly enhances matching accuracy for image data involving multiple modal combinations and outperforms the current state-of-the-art solutions in matching accuracy. Additionally, rectification experiments employing WorldView and TanDEM-X images validate our method’s ability to achieve a matching accuracy of 1.05 pixels, thereby indicating its practical utility and generalization capacity.

We leveraged the International Drought Experiment to study how SOC, including particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) concentrations, responds to extreme drought treatments (1-in-100-year) for 1 to 5 years at 19 sites worldwide. In more mesic areas (aridity index > 0.65), SOC and POC concentrations decreased by 7.9% (±3.9) and 15.9% (±6.2) with drought, respectively, but there were no impacts on MAOC concentrations. However, drought had no impact on SOC, POC, or MAOC concentrations in drylands (aridity index < 0.65). The response of SOC to drought varied along an aridity gradient, concomitant with interannual precipitation variability and standing SOC concentration gradients. These findings highlight the differing response magnitudes of POC and MAOC concentrations to drought and the key regulating role of aridity."

However, experimentally characterizing the structure and reactivity of these transient species is remarkably challenging. Here, we report the high-pressure synthesis of a metastable nonsymmetrical dicopper-μ-oxo compound with exceptional reactivity toward the mono-oxygenation of aliphatic C─H bonds. The nonequivalent coordination environment of copper stabilizes localized mixed valency and greatly enhances the hydrogen atom abstraction activity of the bridging oxygen, enabling room-temperature hydroxylation of methane under pressure.

Here, our single-cell RNA sequencing data identify a subpopulation of macrophages expressing high levels of the phagocytic receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK+macrophages), which is closely associated with melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. Adoptive transfer of the MerTK+macrophages into recipient mice notably accelerated tumor growth regardless of macrophage depletion. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK+macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Specifically targeted delivery of AhR antagonist to tumor-associated macrophages with mannosylated micelles could suppress MerTK expression and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti–programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy.

Plant-derived membrane interfaces, engulfing invasive hyphal projections of fungal and oomycete pathogens, are prominent junctures dictating infection outcomes. Understanding how pathogens transform these host-pathogen interfaces to their advantage remains a key biological question. Here, we identified a conserved effector, secreted by plant pathogenic oomycetes, that co-opts a host Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP), TOPGAP, to remodel the host-pathogen interface. The effector, PiE354, hijacks TOPGAP as a susceptibility factor to usurp its GAP activity on Rab8a, a key Rab GTPase crucial for defense-related secretion. By hijacking TOPGAP, PiE354 purges Rab8a from the plasma membrane, diverting Rab8a-mediated immune trafficking away from the pathogen interface. This mechanism signifies an uncanny evolutionary adaptation of a pathogen effector in co-opting a host regulatory component to subvert defense-related secretion, thereby providing unprecedented mechanistic insights into the reprogramming of host membrane dynamics by pathogens."

Human osteoarchaeological remains preserve small molecules, making them valuable for studies that aim to examine past conditions. We test if there are molecular differences in the metabolome of cortical bone between archaeological individuals who used tobacco and those who did not, and if these differences are distinct enough to assign tobacco use status to individuals with unknown tobacco use. Cortical bone of 323 known and unknown tobacco users was studied by an untargeted metabolomics assay using a liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry platform. We identified 45 discriminating molecular features that differed between tobacco consumers (15 up-regulated features) and nonconsumers (17 up-regulated features). Tobacco consumption leaves a metabolic record in human bone distinctive enough to identify its use in individuals of unknown tobacco consumption.

We describe an unrecognized role for tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in potentiating neo-angiogenesis and vessel stabilization. We show that the endothelium is a major source of TRAIL in the healthy circulation compromised in peripheral artery disease (PAD). EC deletion of TRAIL in vivo or in vitro inhibited neo-angiogenesis, pericyte recruitment, and vessel stabilization, resulting in reduced lower-limb blood perfusion with ischemia. Activation of the TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) restored blood perfusion and stable blood vessel networks in mice. Proof-of-concept studies showed that Conatumumab, an agonistic TRAIL-R2 antibody, promoted vascular sprouts from explanted patient arteries. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor in mediating EC-pericyte communications dependent on TRAIL.

We first show, computationally and experimentally, that an immiscible phase can be robustly positioned at the neck of human aneurysm models to seal and isolate the aneurysm’s cavity for further treatment, including in wide-neck aneurysms. We then demonstrate localized delivery and confined treatment, by selective staining of cell nuclei within the aneurysm cavity as well as by hydrogel-based embolization in patient-specific aneurysm models.

We find that modest delay of paternal mitochondrial elimination (PME) inCaenorhabditis elegansembryos unexpectedly impairs mating and cognition of adult animals and alters their locomotion behaviors. Delayed PME causes decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in early embryos, which lead to impaired physiological functions of adult animals through an energy-sensing pathway mediated by an adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase, AAK-2, and a forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factor, DAF-16. Treatment of PME-delayed animals with MK-4, a subtype of vitamin K2that can improve mitochondrial ATP production, restores ATP levels in early embryos, and rescues physiological defects of adult animals. Our results suggest that moderate PME delay during embryo development adversely affects crucial physiological functions in adults, which could be evolutionarily disadvantageous. These observations provide mechanistic explanations for the need to swiftly remove paternal mitochondria early during embryo development."

During initial infection, HPV16, the most prevalent cancer-causing type, specifically interacts with heparan sulfates (HSs), not only enabling initial cell attachment but also triggering a crucial conformational change in viral capsids termed structural activation. It is unknown, whether these HPV16-HS interactions depend on HS sulfation patterns. Thus, we probed potential roles of HS sulfations using cell-based functional and physicochemical assays, including single-molecule force spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that N-sulfation of HS is crucial for virus binding and structural activation by providing high-affinity sites, and that additional 6O-sulfation is required to mechanically stabilize the interaction, whereas 2O-sulfation and 3O-sulfation are mostly dispensable. Together, our findings identify the contribution of HS sulfation patterns to HPV16 binding and structural activation and reveal how distinct sulfation groups of HS synergize to facilitate HPV16 entry, which, in turn, likely influences the tropism of HPVs."

The major pro-fission DRP1 receptor is mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), and mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kilodaltons (MiD49/51), which can sequester inactive DRP1. Together, they form a trimeric DRP1-MiD-MFF complex. Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK)–mediated phosphorylation of MFF is necessary for mitochondrial fragmentation, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identify MFF as a target of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) at Lys151, MFF SUMOylation is enhanced following AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and that MFF SUMOylation regulates the level of MiD binding to MFF. The mitochondrial stressor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) promotes MFF SUMOylation and mitochondrial fragmentation. However, CCCP-induced fragmentation is impaired in MFF-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing non-SUMOylatable MFF K151R.

Herein, we developed a hypersensitive multiparameter MRA strategy using dual-modality NaGdF4nanoparticles. Because of the longer tumbling time (τR), NaGdF4nanoparticles can improve the longitudinal relaxivity (r1), brightening vessels inT1-weighted sequences. Simultaneously, the regular arrangement of Gd3+in the crystal induces magnetic anisotropy, creating local static magnetic field heterogeneity and generating negative signals inT2-weighted sequences. Consequently, the efficacy of NaGdF4-enhanced high-resolution multiparameter MRA has been validated in diagnosing ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s disease in rodent models.

To find erg3- and erg1-mediated functions, we generated globalKcnh7(erg3) and conditionalKcnh2(erg1) knockout mice. We found that erg3 channels stabilize the resting potential and dampen spontaneous activity in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and hippocampal CA1 neurons, whereas erg1 channels have suprathreshold functions. Lack of erg3 subunits induced hyperexcitability with increased action potential firing in PCs, but not in CA1 neurons. Notably, erg3 depletion caused depressive-like behavior with reduced locomotor activity, strongly decreased digging behavior, and shorter latencies to fall off a rotating wheel, while learning and memory remained unchanged.

To overcome this liability, antibody-drug conjugates were constructed using altered BCL-XL–targeting warheads, unique linker technologies, and therapeutic antibodies. The epidermal growth factor receptor–targeting antibody-drug conjugate AM1-15 inhibited growth of tumor xenografts and did not cause cardiovascular toxicity nor dose-limiting thrombocytopenia in monkeys.

With the SRR, microwaves at dosages below the safe exposure limit are shown to inhibit the firing of neurons within 1 mm of the SRR gap site. The microwave SRR reduced seizure activity at a low dose in both in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy. This microwave dosage is confirmed to be biosafe via histological and biochemical assessment of brain tissue."

Impressively, the mass activity (MA) reaches 2.99 A mgPt−1for ORR overg-Zn–N–C/PtCo, and 79.3% of the initial MA is maintained after 90K cycles in fuel cell.

Salt Lake City, Utah borders protected wilderness areas in the Wasatch Mountains, exhibiting a useful model system in which an urban source of SVOCs, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), is located directly adjacent to an alpine sink. Our objective was to investigate the impacts of topographical features on the transport and deposition of SVOCs across an urban-alpine boundary. To do so, we measured PAHs and PCBs in soils along a transect starting at the urban-mountain interface and extending into an alpine wilderness, crossing several prominent ridgelines. Concentrations of PAHs and PCBs in soils were heavily influenced by soil organic carbon content, air temperature, and proximity to the urban boundary. However, the role of source proximity was only revealed after normalizing concentrations in soil to organic carbon content and air temperature. Further, we present evidence of SVOC emission/deposition cycles driven by diurnal alpine winds that do not extend past topographical features. Our results illustrate the roles of multiple competing processes on SVOC transport in alpine systems and their importance at an urban-alpine boundary."

It demonstrates that easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC, 55–84%) and microbes (16–48%) drive Cr(VI) reduction in soils enriched with goethite and/or hematite, among which in dryland soils microbial sulfate reduction may also be involved. In contrast, EOC (38 ± 1%), microbes (33 ± 1%), and exchangeable and poorly crystalline Fe (oxyhr)oxide-associated Fe(II) (29 ± 3%) contribute to Cr(VI) reduction in paddy soils enriched with ferrihydrite. Additionally, exogenous Fe(II) and microbes significantly enhance Cr(VI) reduction in ferrihydrite- and goethite-rich soils, and Fe(II) greatly promotes but microbes slightly inhibit Cr passivation. Both Fe(II) and microbes, especially the latter, promote OM mineralization and result in the most substantial OM loss in ferrihydrite-rich paddy soils. During the incubation, part of the ferrihydrite converts to goethite but microbes may hinder the transformation.

Wave‐influenced deltas may show alternating accumulation and retreat patterns driven by avulsions and wave‐induced sediment diffusion, posing coastal management challenges. Deltas with higher wave energy evolve under a fine balance between river supply and intense wave‐mediated sediment redistribution and are highly vulnerable under conditions of sediment reduction. Reducing Qs by ∼40%–70%, common in modern dammed rivers, can rapidly shift bypass from ∼0 to 1 (no bypass to complete bypass).

The theory's efficacy for prediction is tested with atmospheric reanalysis by defining “exceedance events”, the time and location where wave activity first exceeds flow capacity. The theory captures the Northern Hemisphere winter blocking climatology, with strong spatial correlation between exceedance and blocking events. Both events are favored not only by low carrying capacity (narrow roads), but also a downstream reduction in capacity (lane closures causing a bottleneck).

CHAR in bat guano is more strongly correlated with prescribed fire than wildfire or total area burned, likely due to bats seeking out areas burned by prescribed fire for better foraging opportunities and/or bats avoiding wildfire. We attribute the CHAR in guano being a better recorder of area burned during non‐winter months to winter bat hibernation.

The high-speed bond exchange in the network, validated by stress-relaxation tests, allows quick molding with household iron. In addition, the material is applied as an adhesion sheet for plastic and metal substrates. Because dynamic cross-linking with the proposed bond exchange mechanism can be implemented for any polymer bearing carboxyl pendants, our approach can be applied to versatile backbones, which must thus be meaningful in the practical sense.

Here we show that REEP1-4 reside in a unique vesicular compartment and identify features that determine their localization. Mutations in REEP1-4 that compromise curvature generation, including those causing disease, relocalize the proteins to the bulk ER. These mutants interact with wild-type proteins to retain them in the ER, consistent with their autosomal-dominant disease inheritance.

 The recording of planetary magnetic fields is often attributed to uniformly-magnetised nanoscopic iron oxides, called single-domain. Yet, the main magnetic constituents of rocks are more complex, non-uniformly magnetised grains in single or multi-vortex states. We know little about their behaviour due to limitations in defining their precise shape and internal magnetic structure. Here we combine non-destructive Ptychographic X-ray Computed Nano-tomography with micromagnetic modelling to explore the magnetic stability of remanence-bearing minerals. Applied to a microscopic rock sample, we identified hundreds of nanoscopic grains of magnetite/maghemite with diverse morphologies. Energy barrier calculations were performed for these irregularly shaped grains. For some grains, these morphological irregularities near the transition from single-domain to the single-vortex state allow for multiple domain states, some unstable and unable to record the field for significant periods. Additionally, some other grains exhibit temperature-dependent occupancy probabilities, potentially hampering experiments to recover the intensity of past magnetic fields.

 Wildfires can produce large plumes of smoke that are transported across vast distances, altering nutrient cycling of undisturbed watersheds exposed downwind. To date, wildfire smoke influence on stream biogeochemical signatures remains an important knowledge gap. Here we evaluate the impacts of wildfire smoke on phosphorus (P) biogeochemical cycling in a temperate watershed in the Finger Lakes Region of Central New York located downwind from record setting Canadian forest fires during the summer of 2023. Daily sampling of stream and rainwaters was conducted over the 2 month smoke period, generating a robust geochemical dataset. Stream dissolved P showed high sensitivity to smoke events, attaining concentrations 2–3 × greater than the pre-smoke period. Subsequent rain events after smoke deposition were identified as a potentially important factor in magnitude and timing of dissolved P responses. These findings demonstrate the capacity for wildfire smoke to trigger rapid, observable changes to stream P chemistry.

 Flood maps based on Earth Observation (EO) data inform critical decision-making in almost every stage of the disaster management cycle, directly impacting the ability of affected individuals and governments to receive aid as well as informing policies on future adaptation. However, flood map validation also presents a challenge in the form of class imbalance between flood and non-flood classes, which has rarely been investigated. There are currently no established best practices for addressing this issue, and the accuracy of these maps is often viewed as a mere formality, which leads to a lack of user trust in flood map products and a limitation in their operational use and uptake. This paper provides the first comprehensive assessment of the impact of current EO-based flood map validation practices. Using flood inundation maps derived from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data with synthetically generated controlled errors and Copernicus Emergency Management Service flood maps as the ground truth, binary metrics were statistically evaluated for the quantification of flood detection accuracy for events under varying flood conditions. Especially, class specific metrics were found to be sensitive to the class imbalance, i.e. larger flood magnitudes result in higher metric scores, thus being naturally biased towards overpredicting classifiers. Metric stability across error percentiles and flood magnitudes was assessed through standard deviation calculated by bootstrapping to quantify the impact of sample selection subjectivity, where stratified sampling schemes exhibited the lowest standard deviation consistently. Thoughtful sample and response design were critical, with probability-based random sampling and proportional or equal class allocation vital to producing robust accuracy estimates comparable across study sites, error classes, and flood magnitudes. Results suggest that popular evaluation metrics such as the F1-Score are in fact unsuitable for accurate characterization of map quality and are not comparable across different study sites or events. Overall accuracy and MCC are shown to be the most robust performance metrics when sampling designs are optimized, and bootstrapping is demonstrated to be a necessary tool for estimating variability in map accuracy observed due to the spatial sampling of validation points. Results presented herein pave the way for the development of global flood map validation guidelines, to support wider use of and trust in EO-derived flood risk and recovery products, eventually allowing us to unlock the full potential of EO for improved flood resilience."

Sunlight is a vital factor for the Cr cycle in the surface environment, which may be affected by photoactive substances such as ferrihydrite (Fh) and dissolved black carbon (DBC). Herein, sunlight-driven transformation dynamics of Cr species on DBC–Fh coprecipitates were studied. Under sunlight, the removal of aqueous Cr(VI) by DBC–Fh coprecipitates occurred through sunlight-driven reductive sequestration including adsorption, followed by surface reduction (pathway 1) and aqueous reduction, followed by precipitation (pathway 2). Additionally, coprecipitates with a higher DBC content exhibited a more effective reduction of both adsorbed (kapp,S_red) and aqueous Cr(VI) (kapp,A_red). Photoelectrons facilitated Cr(VI) reduction through direct electron transfer; notably, electron donating DBC promoted the production of photoelectrons by consuming photogenerated holes. Photogenerated Fe(II) species (mineral-phase and aqueous Fe(II)) mediated electron transfer for Cr(VI) reduction, which was reinforced via a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process between DBC–organic ligands and mineral Fe(III). Furthermore, ·O2– also mediated Cr(VI) reduction, although this impact was limited. Overall, this study demonstrates that photoelectrons and photogenerated electron mediators play a crucial role in Cr(VI) reductive sequestration on DBC–Fh coprecipitates, providing new insights into the geochemical cycle of Cr pollution in sunlight-influenced surface environments."

The correlation coefficients between them are 0.66 (passing the 99.9% confidence level) and 0.12 during 1979–2002 and 2003–2023. Therefore, the May‐June NWPSH has a strong connection with July‐August East Asian precipitation during 1979–2002, but not during 2003–2023. The interdecadal variations in the relationship of NWPSH are due to interdecadal changes of ENSO.

Understanding the factors influencing the generation of QBWO over the TP (QBWOTP) and its physical mechanism is crucial. This study has investigated the influence of multi–timescale and land–atmosphere interactions on the generation of the QBWOTP in surface potential vorticity (SPV), a valuable tool for characterizing the mechanical and thermal variabilities in mountain forcing, based on a 2014 case study. Results indicate that in the free atmosphere, the summer monsoon onset over the Bay of Bengal induces a northward shift in the westerly jet toward the TP, manifested as an increase in low‐frequency zonal winds. This shift facilitates the propagation of wave trains, leading to atmospheric quasi–biweekly potential temperature anomalies (θa) over the TP through a multi‐timescale interaction. Additionally, the TP's surface thermal forcing and arrival of wave trains trigger anomalous upward motion and increase cloud cover. The resultant decrease in net short‐wave radiations and increase in net long‐wave radiations contribute to variations in surface potential temperature (θs) over the TP. As θa and θs evolve, the difference between them enlarges, resulting in the generation of the SPV QBWOTP. Given the relationship between the QBWOTP and downstream rainfall, this study could provide novel insights into understanding and predicting downstream rainfall QBWO."

This study aims to investigate the evolving soil moisture‐heatwave relationship over eastern China in the future, using a convection‐permitting (CP, ∼4 km) regional climate model (RCM). The CP‐RCM model simulates historical (1998–2007) and future (2070–2099) climates over eastern China, with three pseudo‐global warming (PGW) experiments conducted under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios. Results indicate a substantial increase in heatwave frequency (HWF) and magnitude (HWM) over eastern China, particularly under the RCP8.5 scenario. The largest HWF (up to 23 days) is expected in South China (SC), and the largest HWM (up to 3.25°C) is expected in Loess Plateau (LP) and North China Plain (NCP), indicating a pronounced future risk of heatwave in the region. Antecedent soil moisture exhibits a negative correlation with heatwave indices (HWM and HWF) in most areas of eastern China, suggesting its role in mitigating heatwaves. Quantile regression analysis shows that antecedent soil moisture exerts a stronger effect on the upper quantile of the HWF/HWM than on the lower quantile. With global warming, the amplifying effect due to soil moisture deficiency on future heatwaves is expected to expand spatially and become more pronounced. Increased soil moisture control on heatwaves can be attributed to reduced energy limitation and intensified water limitation. A comprehensive investigation across five sub‐regions reveals the role of various soil moisture regimes in modulating heatwaves over eastern China."

Studies to characterize regional differences in OAE efficiencies and biogeochemical effects are still sparse. As subduction regions play a pivotal role for anthropogenic carbon uptake and centennial storage, we here evaluate OAE efficiencies in the subduction regions of the Southern Ocean, the Northwest Atlantic, and the Norwegian‐Barents Sea region. Using the ocean biogeochemistry model FESOM2.1‐REcoM3, we simulate continuous OAE globally and in the subduction regions under high (SSP3‐7.0) and low (SSP1‐2.6) emission scenarios. The OAE efficiency calculated by two different metrics is higher (by 8%–30%) for SSP3‐7.0 than for SSP1‐2.6 due to a lower buffer factor in a high‐CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ world. All subduction regions show a CDR potential (0.23–0.31; PgC CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ uptake per Pg alkaline material) consistent with global OAE for both emission scenarios. Calculating the efficiency as the ratio of excess dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to excess alkalinity shows that the Southern Ocean and the Northwest Atlantic are as efficient as the global ocean (0.79–0.85), while the Norwegian‐Barents Sea region has a lower efficiency (0.65–0.75). The subduction regions store a fraction of excess carbon below 1 km that is 1.9 times higher than the global ocean. The excess surface alkalinity and thus CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ uptake and storage follow the mixed‐layer depth seasonality, with the majority of the excess CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ flux occurring in summer at shallow mixed layer depths. This study therefore highlights that subduction regions can be efficient for OAE if optimal deployment strategies are developed."

Here, the authors show that mutant cells can hijack and reprogram neighboring wildtype cells by mechanically pulling on them. 
 Force-driven cellular interactions are crucial for cancer cell invasion but remain underexplored in vascular abnormalities. Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), a vascular abnormality characterized by leaky vessels, involves CCM mutant cells recruiting wild-type endothelial cells to form and expand mosaic lesions. The mechanisms behind this recruitment remain poorly understood. Here, we use an in-vitro model of angiogenic invasion with traction force microscopy to reveal that hyper-angiogenic Ccm2-silenced endothelial cells enhance angiogenic invasion of neighboring wild-type cells through force and extracellular matrix-guided mechanisms. We demonstrate that mechanically hyperactive CCM2-silenced tips guide wild-type cells by transmitting pulling forces and by creating paths in the matrix, in a ROCKs-dependent manner. This is associated with reinforcement of β1 integrin and actin cytoskeleton in wild-type cells. Further, wild-type cells are reprogrammed into stalk cells and activate matrisome and DNA replication programs, thereby initiating proliferation. Our findings reveal how CCM2 mutants hijack wild-type cell functions to fuel lesion growth, providing insight into the etiology of vascular malformations. By integrating biophysical and molecular techniques, we offer tools for studying cell mechanics in tissue heterogeneity and disease progression.

 The mesophilic methanogenic archaeal model organism Methanosarcina mazei strain Gö1 is crucial for climate and environmental research due to its ability to produce methane. Here, we establish a Ribo-seq protocol for M. mazei strain Gö1 under two growth conditions (nitrogen sufficiency and limitation).

LC-MS analysis validates the translation for 62 annotated small ORFs and 26 unannotated small ORFs. Epitope tagging followed by immunoblotting analysis confirms the translation of 13 out of 16 selected unannotated small ORFs. A comprehensive differential transcription and translation analysis reveals that 29 of 314 unannotated small ORFs are differentially regulated in response to nitrogen availability at the transcriptional and 49 at the translational level. A high number of reported small RNAs are emerging as dual-function RNAs, including sRNA154, the central regulatory small RNA of nitrogen metabolism. Several unannotated small ORFs are conserved in Methanosarcina species and overproducing several (small ORF encoded) small proteins suggests key physiological functions.

Here authors increase the metabolic fitness of CAR-T cells by stable overexpression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, which allows them to increase their glucose intake and enhances their antitumour function. 
 The intensive nutrient requirements needed to sustain T cell activation and proliferation, combined with competition for nutrients within the tumor microenvironment, raise the prospect that glucose availability may limit CAR-T cell function. Here, we seek to test the hypothesis that stable overexpression (OE) of the glucose transporter GLUT1 in primary human CAR-T cells would improve their function and antitumor potency. We observe that GLUT1OE in CAR-T cells increases glucose consumption, glycolysis, glycolytic reserve, and oxidative phosphorylation, and these effects are associated with decreased T cell exhaustion and increased Th17 differentiation. GLUT1OE also induces broad metabolic reprogramming associated with increased glutathione-mediated resistance to reactive oxygen species, and increased inosine accumulation. When challenged with tumors, GLUT1OE CAR-T cells secrete more proinflammatory cytokines and show enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro, and demonstrate superior tumor control and persistence in mouse models. Our collective findings support a paradigm wherein glucose availability is rate limiting for effector CAR-T cell function and demonstrate that enhancing glucose availability via GLUT1OE could augment antitumor immune function.

Here, authors show a selective weakness of certain hypothalamic neurons in a mouse model of social dysfunction and explore its potential therapeutic intervention. 
 Selective vulnerability offers a conceptual framework for understanding neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, where specific neuronal types are selectively affected and adjacent ones are spared. However, the applicability of this framework to neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those characterized by atypical social behaviors, such as autism spectrum disorder, remains uncertain. Here we show that an embryonic disturbance, known to induce social dysfunction in male mice, preferentially impaired the gene expression crucial for neural functions in parvocellular oxytocin (OT) neurons—a subtype linked to social rewards—while neighboring cell types experienced a lesser impact. Chemogenetic stimulation of OT neurons at the neonatal stage ameliorated social deficits in early adulthood, concurrent with cell-type-specific sustained recovery of pivotal gene expression within parvocellular OT neurons. Collectively, our data shed light on the transcriptomic selective vulnerability within the hypothalamic social behavioral center and provide a potential therapeutic target through specific neonatal neurostimulation. The specific cell types affected in neurodevelopmental disorders remain elusive. Here, authors show a selective weakness of certain hypothalamic neurons in a mouse model of social dysfunction and explore its potential therapeutic intervention."

 Traditional forest inventory supplies essential data for forest monitoring and management, including tree species, but obtaining individual tree-level information is increasingly crucial. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with multispectral observation offers rich information for improved forest inventory mapping with reliable individual tree attributes. Although deep learning techniques have shown promise in tree species classification, they are not sufficiently explored for individual tree-level classification using low-density (less than 30 point/m2) Airborne Multispectral LiDAR (AML) data. This study therefore explores the feasibility of using a deep learning (DL) framework for processing low-density AML point clouds to enhance tree species classification in challenging forest environments. A point-based deep learning network with a dual-branch mechanism combined Cross-Branch Attention modules named Attribute-Aware Cross-Branch (AACB) Transformer is designed for AML data to better differentiate tree species from delineated individual trees. In addition, a channel merging approach is introduced, which is suited to prepare the training samples of deep learning networks and reduces the computational costs. This study was tested with an average 9 points/m2 AML point cloud for 6 tree species including Populus tremuloides, Larix laricina, Acer saccharum, Picea abies, Pinus resinosa, and Pinus strobus from a Canadian mixed forest. The overall accuracies achieved 83.1 %, 85.8 %, and 95.3 % at species, genus, and leaf-type levels, respectively. The comparison between the proposed method and other widely used tree species classification methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing tree species classification accuracy. We discuss potentials and remaining challenges, and our findings allow to further improve tree species classification of low-density AML point clouds by DL technology."

 This study investigates the characteristics of tropical cyclones (TCs) that cause extreme hourly precipitation (EXHP) in Zhejiang, China, using datasets from 67 national stations (Con-ST) and 1551 surface stations (All-ST), spanning 1973–2020 and 2011–2020, respectively. Our analysis revealed notable variations in the EXHP caused by individual TCs. The top 10 % of TCs contributed 37.2–38 % of the total TC-induced EXHP amount, while the bottom 50 % only accounted for 5.8–22.7 %. Using sparse stations may overestimate the impact of TCs causing EXHP in the lower to middle rankings. Long-term trend analysis suggested a consistent increase in TC-induced EXHP despite a decreasing trend in the number of TCs affecting Zhejiang. High-value EXHP centers tended to be concentrated in mountainous areas within 0–50 km from the coastline, where Con-ST stations are sparse and can significantly underestimate EXHP. The maximum amount of EXHP per TC increased logarithmically with the number of observation stations. In Zhejiang, EXHP predominantly occurred northeast of the TC centers (50.4–61.7 %) and within 500 km from the TC center (69.5–81.5 %). High-frequency EXHP centers exhibited a clockwise rotation with increasing distance from the TC center–a pattern resembling a “spiral rainband.” A key area where most EXHP in Zhejiang occurred when TC centers remained within this area was identified. The TC intensity within the key area was a key factor influencing EXHP occurrence in Zhejiang, whereas the duration of TC center residence within the key area and the distance of its movement were crucial predictors of significant EXHP occurrence. The analysis of large-scale environmental fields revealed that high-EXHP TCs are characterized by strong upper-level divergence, intense upward motion, and an expanded subtropical high. The southeasterly steering airflow drives these TCs northwestward, prolonging their impact on Zhejiang and resulting in significant moisture accumulation and EXHP."

Negative emission technologies and practices (NETPs) such as af-/reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture and storage, biochar, and enhanced weathering were considered. Three different storylines were created to describe the role of NETPs in varying future developments. The scenario storylines illustrate potential opportunities and constraints for large scale NETP implementation focusing on (1) optimistic technology development, (2) strict protection of planetary boundaries, and (3) increased self-sufficiency due to geopolitical risks associated with policy fragmentation. The results show that the demand for NETPs could be on a gigaton scale to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050. As different countries have different opportunities to implement NETPs, none of the NETP options should be excluded from mitigation portfolios at this stage. The results also indicate the potential of NETPs in providing cost-effective solutions for achieving climate targets.

The rapid development, deployment, and diffusion of such methods will likely require the coordination of science, technology, policy, and societal support. This article proposes a bibliometric approach to quantify the public use of early-stage research in CDR. Specifically, we employ generalized linear models to estimate the likelihood that scientific advances in eight different carbon removal solutions may induce (i) further production of scientific knowledge, (ii) technological innovation, and (iii) policy and media discussion. Our main result is that research in CDR is of significant social value. CDR research generates significant, positive, yet heterogeneous spillovers within science and from science to technology, policy, and media. In particular, advances in Direct Air Capture spur further research and tend to result in patentable technologies, while Blue Carbon and Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage appear to gain relative momentum in the policy and public debate. Moreover, scientific production and collaborations cluster geographically by type of CDR, potentially affecting long-term carbon removal strategies.

This case study offers valuable lessons for other megacities facing similar water security issues. The study particularly explores result-based financing (RBF) as a promising strategy to strengthen Mexico City’s RWH sector. Despite its potential, research on RBF for water supply diversification remains limited, especially from the perspective of practitioners. To address this gap, the study employs a systems thinking approach supported by qualitative methods, including a literature review and interviews. Thematic networks analysis revealed that RBF could enhance Cosecha de Lluvia by improving monitoring and results measurement, facilitating information exchange, and increasing transparency—key factors for successful water supply diversification. While these identified benefits do not address all of Cosecha de Lluvia’s challenges and RBF could have implementation challenges, there is a clear opportunity for this financial mechanism to enhance programs like the one studied and have a positive impact on several of its elements. As part of the RBF suitability assessment, three different funding sources were evaluated—public, private, and philanthropic—to determine their effectiveness in overcoming Cosecha de Lluvia’s challenges. The findings suggest that no single source of finance markedly influences the program’s effectiveness alone. Instead, a blended financing approach that integrates all three sources is recommended as a strategy to explore further for implementing RBF in water supply diversification efforts. Overall, the study highlights the necessity of diversifying water supply to build climate resilience in megacities. While programs like Cosecha de Lluvia are crucial, significant room for improvement exists.

We also draw preliminary lessons from ocean fertilization and solar radiation management cases to highlight the significance of involving members of the public in conversation about climate intervention technologies in early stages of the research and development process. While we emphasize that engagement is not a checkbox for gaining social license, these cases illustrate how neglecting public engagement can be unnecessarily detrimental to proposed research. We further point to an enhanced weathering experiment to highlight how early engagement can foster ethical processes and outcomes, which enhance alignment of research with societal values. While empirical evidence does not yet support the argument that engagement always results in the outcomes researchers desire, it does always result in justice enhancing outcomes and should therefore be pursued regardless.

Coastal region of Bangladesh has been struggling with elevated levels of soil and water salinity, exacerbated by storm surges and rising sea levels. We assessed nutrient and salinity contents in agricultural and homestead lands, and the level of salinity in pond and canal water in six sub-districts in coastal Bangladesh. Finally, using household (HH) survey, focus group discussion (FGD) and key informant interview (KII), we explored the adaptive practices and challenges of salinity issues in agriculture and drinking water management. Soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents exhibited significant variations across the sub-districts, which reflect the diversity of agricultural practices and soil management strategies. However, there was no notable difference in soil salinity across the sub-districts, which underscores the commonality of soil salinity as a pressing concern. Shyamnagar (13.99 dS m−1) recorded the highest level of pond water salinity, followed by Assasuni (13.96 dS m−1), Dacope (13.91 dS m−1), Koyra (13.58 dS m−1), Morrelganj (13.33 dS m−1), and Mongla (13.19 dS m−1) sub-districts, which highlights that water salinity decreased from exposed coast to the landward areas. Respondents in HH surveys, FGDs and KIIs identified salinity as a major challenge in agriculture and drinking water. Furthermore, climate-related stresses were recognized as significant challenges impacting crop productivity. The research highlights the feasibility of rainwater harvesting, with 89%–100% of HHs harvest rainwater in HH tanks, as an effective adaptive practice for managing drinking water. The study emphasizes the positive impact of vermicompost in reducing soil salinity levels, which is demonstrated by the 43%–88% of HHs using this practice, indicating its potential as a nature-based solution to address soil salinization.

The latest scientific reports emphasized that net-zero targets can not be achieved globally or nationally without deploying such technologies. Germany aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, and negative emissions thereafter, which means a higher demand for CDRs. Despite BECCS being the building block of net-zero policies, its implementation on a national and regional scale presents serious challenges. Therefore, in this study, we analyze the role of BECCS in the German bioenergy system with a spatially detailed bottom–up optimization model that accounts for techno-economics and political aspects of BECCS (e.g. availability of biomass and investment costs). Our analysis demonstrates that BECCS can remove almost 61 Mt CO2 in 2050; however, the outcomes demonstrate sensitivity toward CO2 credit and CO2 prices, which can raise the removal as high as 69 Mt CO2. Additionally, results suggest that removing enough CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality in Germany by 2045 solely through BECCS seems extremely challenging; thus, a portfolio of negative emission technologies will be necessary to contribute. Our findings provide a better understanding of BECCS feasibility and its potential to assist us in achieving climate targets in Germany.

However, the influence climate change and changing land use will have on these events remains unclear. A large ensemble generated using the Max-Planck Institute (MPI) Earth system model is used to generate projections of NE windstorms under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and to attribute changes to projected land use land cover (LULC) change, externally forced changes and internal climate variability. To reduce the influence of coarse grid cell resolution and uncertainties in surface roughness lengths, windstorms are identified using simultaneous widespread exceedance of local 99th percentile 10 m wind speeds (U99). Projected declines in forest cover in the NE and the resulting reductions in surface roughness length under SSP3-7.0 lead to projections of large increases in U99 and derived windstorm intensity and scale. However, these projected changes in regional LULC under SSP3-7.0 are unprecedented in a historical context and may not be realistic. After corrections are applied to remove the influence of LULC on wind speeds, regionally averaged U99 exhibit declines for most of the single model initial-condition large ensemble (SMILE) members which are broadly proportional to the radiative forcing and global air temperature increase in the SSPs, with a median value of −0.15 ms−1 °C−1. While weak cyclones are projected to decline in frequency in the NE, intense cyclones and the resulting windstorms and indices of socioeconomic loss do not. Where present, significant trends in these loss indices are positive, and some MPI SMILE members generate future windstorms that are unprecedented in the historical period."

We incorporate spatial heterogeneity into regional sea level projections and population projections from 2020 to 2100, extreme sea levels (ESLs) of 10-, 50-, and 100 year return periods (RP), and local coastal protection standards. Our findings indicate that the inundated areas expand continuously within the century with heightened exposure under higher emission scenarios. Although the coastal population is projected to decline, the fraction of the coastal population exposed to flooding increases across all scenarios, with accelerated growth under higher GHG emissions and higher ESLs. Zhejiang and Jiangsu emerge as the provinces most exposed to sea-level rise, whereas Taizhou, Nantong, Wuxi, Panjin, and Huzhou are identified as the top five cities with the highest population exposure to local sea level rise (SLR). Transitioning towards a sustainable scenario (i.e. SSP1-2.6) rather than a fossil fuel-intensive one (i.e. SSP5-8.5) can reduce the local SLR and substantially mitigate these exposures. Compared to the median projections under SSP5-8.5, aligning GHG emissions with SSP1-2.6 could reduce population exposure substantially in all coastal provinces, especially in Jiangsu, where population exposure to 100 year RP coastal floods would be reduced by ∼1.6 M in 2050 and by ∼5.4 M in 2100."

Wildfire risk is closely connected to shifting climatic trends and their impacts on fuel availability and flammability. Although previous research has explored the connection between meteorological conditions and wildfire probabilities, there remains a substantial gap in understanding the influence of hydrologic drivers, such as groundwater recharge, on wildfire dynamics. Both short- and long-term variations in these variables are crucial in shaping fuel conditions, and significant changes can create environments more prone to severe wildfires. This study focuses on Santa Barbara County to examine the connection between wildfire probability and various environmental factors, including meteorological and hydrological data from 1994 to 2021, topography, vegetation, and proximity to road. Using a random forest (RF) machine learning model and fine-scale data (270 m resolution) we achieved high predictive accuracy in identifying wildfire probability. Our findings confirm the important roles of short-term meteorological conditions, such as mean precipitation 12 months and relative humidity 1 month before a wildfire event, in predicting wildfire occurrence. In addition, our results emphasize the critical contribution of long-term hydrological components, such as mean deviation from the historical normal in actual evapotranspiration and recharge in the years preceding the fire, in influencing wildfire probability. Partial dependence plots from our RF model revealed that both positive and negative deviations of these hydrological variables can increase the likelihood of wildfire by controlling fuel water availability and productivity. These findings are particularly relevant given the increasing extreme weather patterns in southern California, significantly affecting water availability and fuel conditions. This study provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between wildfire occurrence and hydrometeorological conditions. Additionally, the resulting wildfire probability map, can aid in identifying high-risk areas, contributing to enhanced mitigation planning and prevention strategies."

This heatwave exhibited the longest maximum duration of the past 50 years. According to the probability density function, the maximum temperature also reached an unprecedented high. A long-lived anticyclone dominated North China, causing persistent downward motion and adiabatic heating, enabling the heatwave to form and continue for more than 20 d. The Indian, Pacific, and North Atlantic oceans all experienced extreme warming. However, our results indicate that North Atlantic warming played a decisive role in the occurrence of this heatwave by exciting a Rossby wave train that propagated eastward, generating the long-lived anomalous anticyclone and inducing heatwaves.

The evaluation and validation results confirm the reliability of this dataset. The altimeter-based virtual stations along the world’s coastlines can be built from this dataset to monitor the coastal sea level changes where tide gauges are unavailable. Therefore, it would be beneficial for both oceanographic communities and policy makers. 
 A new dedicated coastal sea level dataset called the International Altimetry Service 2024 (IAS2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13208305, Peng et al., 2024c) has been presented to monitor sea level changes along the world’s coastlines. One of the reasons for generating this dataset is the quality of coastal altimeter data has been greatly improved with advanced coastal reprocessing strategies. In this study, the Seamless Combination of Multiple Retrackers (SCMR) strategy is adopted to obtain the reprocessed Jason data for January 2002 and April 2022. The evaluation results show that the data availability of the IAS2024 dataset over global coastal oceans is much higher than that of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative version 2.3 (ESA CCI v2.3) dataset. The closure of trend differences (0.16 ± 3.98 mm yr−1) between IAS2024 and Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) tide gauge data is observed at the global scale, which further demonstrates the good performance of the IAS2024 dataset in monitoring the coastal sea level changes. The altimeter-based virtual stations have been built with the IAS2024 dataset over 0−10 km, 5−15 km and 10−20 km coastal strips, which will contribute to the analysis of coastal sea levels for the ocean community and the risk management for the policy makers. Our study also points out that no obvious variations exist in linear sea level trends from offshore to the coast in most coastal zones. In addition, the vertical land motion (VLM) estimates from the combination of coastal altimeter data with tide gauge records agree well with the University of La Rochelle 7a (ULR7a) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) solution (0.09 ± 2.22 mm yr−1), suggesting that altimeter-derived VLM estimates can be an independent data source to validate the GNSS solutions."

 Seismic facies classiﬁcation is crucial for seismic stratigraphic interpretation and hydrocarbon reservoir characterization but remains a tedious and time-consuming task that requires signiﬁcant manual effort. The data-driven deep learning approaches are highly promising to automate the seismic facies classiﬁcation with high efﬁciency and accuracy, as they have already achieved signiﬁcant success in similar image classiﬁcation tasks within the ﬁeld of computer vision (CV). However, unlike the CV domain, the ﬁeld of seismic exploration lacks a comprehensive benchmark dataset for seismic facies, severely limiting the development, application, and evaluation of deep learning approaches in seismic facies classiﬁcation. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive workﬂow to construct a massive-scale benchmark dataset of seismic facies and evaluate its effectiveness in training a deep learning model. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst develop a knowledge graph of seismic facies based on the geological concepts and seismic reﬂection conﬁgurations. Guided by the graph, we then implement three strategies of ﬁeld seismic data curation, knowledge-guided synthesization, and GAN-based generation to construct a benchmark dataset of 8000 diverse samples for ﬁve common seismic facies. Finally, we use the benchmark dataset to train a network and then apply it on two 3-D seismic data for automatic seismic facies classiﬁcation. The predictions are highly consistent with expert interpretation results, demonstrating the diversity and representativeness of our benchmark dataset is sufﬁcient to train a network that can generalize well in seismic facies classiﬁcation across ﬁeld data. We have made this dataset, the trained model and associated codes publicly available for further research and validation of intelligent seismic facies classiﬁcation."

We test the new snow model over a set of sites where in situ observations are available. We find that when compared to a simpler snow model, this model improves predictions of seasonal snow and of soil temperature under the snowpack, important variables for simulating both the hydrological cycle and the global climate system. 
 Snowpacks modulate water storage over extended land regions and at the same time play a central role in the surface albedo feedback, impacting the climate system energy balance. Despite the complexity of snow processes and their importance for both land hydrology and global climate, several state-of-the-art land surface models and Earth System Models still employ relatively simple descriptions of the snowpack dynamics. In this study we present a newly-developed snow scheme tailored to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) land model version 4.1. This new snowpack model, named GLASS (Global LAnd–Snow Scheme), includes a refined and dynamical vertical-layering snow structure that allows us to track the temporal evolution of snow grain properties in each snow layer, while at the same time limiting the model computational expense, as is necessary for a model suited to global-scale climate simulations. In GLASS, the evolution of snow grain size and shape is explicitly resolved, with implications for predicted bulk snow properties, as they directly impact snow depth, snow thermal conductivity, and optical properties. Here we describe the physical processes in GLASS and their implementation, as well as the interactions with other surface processes and the land–atmosphere coupling in the GFDL Earth System Model. The performance of GLASS is tested over 10 experimental sites, where in situ observations allow for a comprehensive model evaluation. We find that when compared to the current GFDL snow model, GLASS improves predictions of seasonal snow water equivalent, primarily as a consequence of improved snow albedo. The simulated soil temperature under the snowpack also improves by about 1.5 K on average across the sites, while a negative bias of about 1 K in snow surface temperature is observed."

However, increasing mechanical recycling may have unintended negative consequences. For example, recycling of PVC flooring containing hazardous plasticizers that were used in the past may lead to continued exposure. Here we propose measures to increase recycling while circumventing adverse health impacts caused by legacy additives. For this, we conduct a dynamic substance flow analysis for Switzerland and the time period from 1950 to 2100, focusing on three plasticizers: di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisononyl phthalate (DiNP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT). We quantify the uncertainty of results, check their plausibility against measured concentrations in samples representative for the Swiss market, and compare them with modeled substance flows in Germany. Based on the cross-checked model, future average concentrations of DEHP in PVC flooring on the Swiss market are expected to be above the legal limit of 0.1 wt % for several decades if increased recycling rates are implemented without additional measures. Phasing out the potentially concerning DiNP, too, and preventing phthalates from entering recycling would lower their average market concentrations to values below 0.1 wt % and enable increasing recycling rates without compromising product safety. Analogous measures could help achieve this goal across other European countries and product groups."

Yet, understanding their contribution to global biogeochemical cycling of mercury remains elusive. Here, we show that microbial transformation of nanoparticulate divalent mercury can be an important source of elemental and methylmercury.Geobacter sulfurreducensPCA, a model bacterium predominant in anoxic environments (e.g., paddy soils), simultaneously reduces and methylates nanoparticulate Hg(II). Moreover, the relative prevalence of these two competing processes and the dominant transformation pathways differ markedly between nanoparticulate Hg(II) and its dissolved and bulk-sized counterparts. Notably, even when intracellular reduction of Hg(II) nanoparticles is constrained by cross-membrane transport (a rate-limiting step that also regulates methylation), the overall Hg(0) formation remains substantial due to extracellular electron transfer. With multiple lines of evidence based on microscopic and electrochemical analyses, gene knockout experiments, and theoretical calculations, we show that nanoparticulate Hg(II) is preferentially associated with c-type cytochromes on cell membranes and has a higher propensity for accepting electrons from the heme groups than adsorbed ionic Hg(II), which explains the surprisingly larger extent of reduction of nanoparticles than dissolved Hg(II) at relatively high mercury loadings. These findings have important implications for the assessment of global mercury budgets as well as the bioavailability of nanominerals and mineral nanoparticles."

C. Simon and Jennifer G. Murphy,Ozone Uptake Kinetics and Implications for the Extent of Modification of Airborne Pollen,"Ground-level ozone, a highly reactive air pollutant, is known to cause significant damage to biological surfaces. Understanding the interaction between ozone and pollen is crucial, as it may influence pollen allergenicity and reproductive viability. Measurements were conducted to determine the kinetics and extent of ozone uptake for 12 different types of tree pollen (Birch, Sycamore Maple, Box Elder Maple, Alder Gray, Cypress, Ash, Mulberry, Juniper, White Pine, Lombardy Poplar, Red Oak, and Black Oak). The results revealed an initial rapid uptake of ozone, followed by a gradual decline due to the saturation of surface reaction sites and the depletion of reactive substances. The geometric initial uptake coefficients (γ0-geo) ranged from 0.4 to 6.4 ×  10–5, and surface saturation was reached under our experimental conditions on a time scale of 1500–10,000 s. Using the integrated uptake of ozone over the observation period, we calculated surface site concentrations of 1014–1016 sites cm–2. Most experiments were performed under dry conditions, but tests with Birch at intermediate relative humidities, up to 60%, showed that the presence of water may decrease the uptake coefficient by a factor of 2. When Ash, Birch and Black Oak pollen grains were manually crushed to mimic subpollen particles, they were found to take up orders of magnitude more ozone for the same mass of pollen. For pollen grains washed in acetone to extract soluble molecules from the pollen coat, the cumulative ozone uptake for some pollen types was significantly reduced. This reduction was interpreted to arise as a loss of reactive surface sites and lipids with C═C bonds, which are crucial for ozone interactions. The presence of highly antioxidant molecules, like carotenoids in Ash, was confirmed spectroscopically, and linked to the extremely high cumulative uptake of ozone, suggesting a protective role for the pollen coat. A box model representing diurnally varying emissions, ozone oxidation and deposition was used to estimate the typical extent of oxidation of airborne pollen. The model indicated that surface oxidation peaked in the afternoon and evening concurrent with high ozone levels, and the percent oxidation ranged from 24% to 97% depending on the pollen species. Sensitivity analysis suggested that conclusively determining whether pollen grains are fully oxidized or unoxidized in the atmosphere is challenging. Instead, the extent of oxidation falls within a range that warrants further investigation into its impact on pollen and human exposure."

Most assessments of future heat‐related risks however are based on coarse resolution projections of heat hazards and overlook the contribution of relevant factors other than climate change to the negative impacts on health. Research highlights sociodemographic disparities related to heat stress vulnerability, especially among older adults, women and individuals with low socioeconomic status, leading to higher morbidity and mortality rates. There is thus an urgent need for detailed, local information on demographic characteristics underlying vulnerability with refined spatial resolution. This study aims to address the research gaps by presenting a new population projection exercise at high‐resolution based on the Bayesian modeling framework for the case study of Madrid, using demographic data under the scenarios compatible with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. We examine the spatial and temporal distribution of population subgroups at the intra‐urban level within Madrid. Our findings reveal a concentration of vulnerable populations, as measured by their age, sex and educational attainment level in some of the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods. These vulnerable clusters are projected to widen in the future unless a sustainable trajectory is realized, driving vulnerability dynamics toward a more uniform and resilient change.

 The irradiated tumor itself represents an opportunity to establish endogenous in situ vaccines. However, such in situ cancer vaccination (ISCV) triggered by radiation therapy (RT) alone is very weak and hardly elicits systemic anticancer immunity. In this study, we develop two-dimensional risedronate-manganese nanobelts (RMn-NBs) as an adjuvant for RT to address this issue. RMn-NBs exhibit good T2 magnetic resonance imaging performance and enhanced Fenton-like catalytic activity, which induces immunogenic cell death. RMn-NBs can inhibit the HIF-1α/VEGF axis to empower RT and synchronously activate the cGAS/STING pathway for promoting the secretion of type I interferon, thereby boosting RT-triggered ISCV and immune checkpoint blockade therapy against primary and metastatic tumors. RMn-NBs as a nano-adjuvant for RT show good biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy, presenting a promising prospect for cancer radiotherapy and immunotherapy.

Here, the authors illustrated the role of AtPRMT3-RPS2B in maintaining ribosome assembly and coordinating growth-stress trade-off. 
 Translation, a fundamental process regulating cellular growth and proliferation, relies on functional ribosomes. As sessile organisms, plants have evolved adaptive strategies to maintain a delicate balance between growth and stress response. But the underlying mechanisms, particularly on the translational level, remain less understood. In this study, we revealed the mechanisms of AtPRMT3-RPS2B in orchestrating ribosome assembly and managing translational regulation. Through a forward genetic screen, we identified PDCD2-D1 as a suppressor gene restoring abnormal development and ribosome biogenesis in atprmt3-2 mutants. Our findings confirmed that PDCD2 interacts with AtPRMT3-RPS2B, and facilitates pre-ribosome transport through nuclear pore complex, finally ensuring normal ribosome translation in the cytoplasm. Additionally, the dysfunction of AtPRMT3-RPS2B was found to enhance freezing tolerance. Moreover, we revealed that AtPRMT3-RPS2B promotes the translation of housekeeping mRNAs while concurrently repressing stress-related mRNAs. In summary, our study sheds light on the regulatory roles of AtPRMT3-RPS2B in ribosome assembly and translational balance, enabling the trade-off between growth and stress.

This effect is reasonably captured in the CMIP6 Historical simulations from a multi-model ensemble perspective. Further analysis of the global warming scenario projects that the influence of winter Atlantic Niño on ENSO will persist into the future, in contrast to the reduced impact of summer Atlantic Niño.

To address these UAV-specific challenges, we propose the CSStereo network (Contrastive Learning and Feature Selection Stereo Matching Network), which integrates contrastive learning and feature selection modules. The contrastive learning module enhances feature representation by comparing similarities and differences between samples, thereby improving discrimination among features in UAV scenarios. The feature selection module enhances robustness and generalization across different UAV scenarios by selecting relevant and informative features.

 Mangroves are one of the most important marine ecosystems globally, their spatial distribution is crucial for promoting mangrove ecosystems conservation, restoration, and sustainable managements. This study proposed a novel Unet-Multi-Scale High-Resolution Vision Transformer (UHRViT) model for classifying mangrove species using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-RGB), UAV-LiDAR, and Gaofen-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (GF-3 SAR) images. The UHRViT utilized a multi-scale high-resolution visual Transformer as its backbone network and was designed to a multi-branch U-shaped network structure to extract features of different scales layer by layer, and to facilitate the interaction of high and low-level semantic information. We further verified the classification performance superiority of UHRViT model by comparing to HRViT and HRNetV2 algorithms. We also systematically investigated the effects of active–passive image combination ratios on mangrove communities mapping. The results revealed that: UAV-RGB images exhibited the better classification accuracy (mean F1-score＞95 %) for mangrove species than UAV-LiDAR and GF-3 SAR images; The classification performances and stability of UHRViT algorithm in the fifteen datasets outperformed the HRViT and HRNetV2 algorithms; Combining UAV-RGB with GF-3 SAR or UAV-LiDAR images respectively, both achieved better classifications than the single data source. Based on the UHRViT algorithm, the combination of UAV-RGB and UAV-LiDAR achieved the highest classification accuracy (Iou = 0.944, MIou = 50.2 %) for Avicennia corniculatum (AC). When the combination ratio of UAV-RGB with GF-3 SAR or UAV-LiDAR was 3:1, Avicennia marina and AC both obtained the optimal classification accuracy with average F1-scores of 98.19 % and 97.3 %, respectively.

 Rice, a crucial global food crop, necessitates accurate mapping for food security assessment. China, a major rice producer and consumer, includes Jiangsu Province as a significant rice production region. The Hongzehu (HZH) area in Jiangsu contributes substantially to rice supply, supporting food security locally and province-wide. Sentinel-1 SAR data, particularly Single Look Complex (SLC) products, holds promise for precise crop mapping with enhanced phase and polarization information, enhancing sensitivity to rice growth changes by analyzing rice surface features information. However, challenges persist, especially climate impacts and timing inconsistencies between fields for planting rice. To overcome this, our study proposes a progressive feature screening and fusion method using multi-temporal SAR images. We introduce fuzzy coarse screening based on statistical distribution characteristics and refine it with Gaussian fitting. A model incorporating time-series sample separation and polarization decomposition feature fusion based on rice growth height enhances rice growth expression. For more precise results, we advocate a multi-temporal feature fusion approach using optimized sample features in the BiLSTM network to characterize rice growth and ground features. Experimental results demonstrate the method’s efficacy in two cities with a limited number of sampling points. The progressive feature fusion (DF) method outperforms classical classification methods using single feature (SF) or combined features (CF). Our proposed strategy proves effective for rice mapping applications, providing a promising approach for leveraging Sentinel-1 SLC SAR data. In conclusion, our study enhances accuracy in identifying rice fields and characterizing rice growth, contributing to improved food security assessments despite challenges associated with rainy seasons and planting times."

 Hyperspectral imaging of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is required for plant phenotyping and stress detection. However, the most accurate instruments for SIF quantification, such as sub-nanometer (≤1-nm full-width at half-maximum, FWHM) airborne hyperspectral imagers, are expensive and uncommon. Previous studies have demonstrated that standard narrow-band hyperspectral imagers (i.e., 4–6-nm FWHM) are more cost-effective and can provide far-red SIF quantified at 760 nm (SIF760), which correlates strongly with precise sub-nanometer resolution measurements. Nevertheless, narrow-band SIF760 quantifications are subject to systematic overestimation owing to the influence of the spectral resolution (SR). In this study, we propose a modelling approach based on the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model with the objective of enhancing the accuracy of absolute SIF760 levels derived from standard airborne hyperspectral imagers in practical settings. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using airborne imagery acquired from two airborne hyperspectral imagers (FWHM ≤ 0.2-nm and 5.8-nm) flown in tandem on board an aircraft that collected data from two different wheat and maize phenotyping trials. Leaf biophysical and biochemical traits were first estimated from airborne narrow-band reflectance imagery and subsequently used as SCOPE model inputs to simulate a range of top-of-canopy (TOC) radiance and SIF spectra at 1-nm FWHM. The SCOPE simulated radiance spectra were then convolved to match the spectral configuration of the narrow-band imager to compute the 5.8-nm FWHM SIF760. A site-specific model was constructed by employing the convolved 5.8-nm SR SIF760 as the independent variable and the 1-nm SR SIF760 directly simulated by SCOPE as the dependent variable. When applied to the airborne dataset, the estimated SIF760 at 1-nm SR from the standard narrow-band hyperspectral imager matched the reference sub-nanometer quantified SIF760 with root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.5 mW/m2/nm/sr, yielding R2 = 0.93–0.95 from the two experiments. These results suggest that the proposed modelling approach enables the interpretation of SIF760 quantified using standard hyperspectral imagers of 4–6 nm FWHM for stress detection and plant physiological condition assessment."

 Increasing exposure to heatwaves threatens public health, challenging various socioeconomic sectors in the coming decades. Prior studies mostly concentrated on the heatwaves occurring in specific regions by examining temperature durations, ignoring the fact that heatwaves typically swept across a large area. To comprehensively assess the effects of heatwaves, we jointly analyzed public attention to heatwaves using a dataset of over 10 million geo-located Weibo tweets across 321 cities in China. By considering spatial disparities, two kinds of public attention at city level, namely the number of heat-related tweets (NHTs) and the ratio of heat-related tweets (RHTs), were designed to indicate the severity and location of heatwave impacts, respectively. The heat cumulative intensity was used as a proxy for heatwaves, which exhibited more significant correlations with RHTs than NHTs. The multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was employed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of environment, demographic, and economic-social factors. Six city groups were clustered with MGWR coefficients that were consistent with the seven geographic subregions of China. This research provides a new perspective and methodology for public attention to heatwaves using geo-located social sensing data and highlights the need for actions to mitigate future heatwave stress in sensitive cities."

We link prolonged withdrawal from cocaine to the depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z, coupled with increased genome accessibility and latent priming of gene transcription, in D1 dopamine receptor–expressing medium spiny neurons (D1 MSNs) that relate to aberrant gene expression upon drug relapse. The histone chaperone ANP32E removes H2A.Z from chromatin, and we demonstrate that D1 MSN–selectiveAnp32eknockdown prevents cocaine-induced H2A.Z depletion and blocks cocaine’s rewarding actions. By contrast, very different effects of cocaine exposure, withdrawal, and relapse were found for D2 MSNs. These findings establish histone variant exchange as an important mechanism and clinical target engaged by drugs of abuse to corrupt brain function and behavior."

However, achieving a detailed understanding of how human-related disturbances impact forest successional trajectories needs comprehensive information spanning forest strata. Here, we investigate the impact of recurrent wildfires on forest structure, species diversity, and composition, making a comprehensive assessment of the regenerating, understory, and canopy tree communities in a sustainable use reserve in the eastern Amazon. Plant communities were described across 16 forest stands (old-growth, burned once and twice) sampling a total of 3620 individuals and 326 tree and palm species. Wildfires affected all attributes of forest structure. Aboveground biomass decreased by 44% in forest burned once, and 71% in twice-burned forest stands. Forest canopy was the most affected strata after the second fire, with a 44%-decrease compared to unburned forest. The same pattern emerged for basal area, which decreased by an average of 27.5% after the first fire and 53.8% following the second fire event. Overall, plant communities experienced a 50%-loss of species richness after two fires, including both dominant and rare species. Plant communities also became more dissimilar as fire events accumulated, with 58%–61% increase in species dissimilarity following two fires events. As wildfires reoccured, the old-growth forests of our focal landscape were converted into a mosaic of regenerating forest stands dominated by local short-lived pioneers (i.e. low-biomass early-regenerating forest stands) and a few tree species less sensitive to fire. Our findings highlight the urgent need to secure a resilient future for Amazonian forests with actions needed to support local livelihoods whilst reducing the prevalence of ignitions sources and allowing forest recovery."

 Vehicles are among the most important contributors to global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, the lack of fuel-, vehicle-type-, and age-specific information about global on-road CO2 emissions in existing datasets, which are available only at the sector level, makes these datasets insufficient for supporting the establishment of emission mitigation strategies. Thus, a fleet turnover model is developed in this study, and CO2 emissions from global on-road vehicles from 1970 to 2020 are estimated for each country. Here, we analyze the evolution of the global vehicle stock over 50 years, identify the dominant emission contributors by vehicle and fuel type, and further characterize the age distribution of on-road CO2 emissions.

The contribution of diesel vehicles to global on-road CO2 emissions doubled during the 1970–2020 period, driven by the shift in the fuel-type distribution of vehicle ownership. The proportion of CO2 emissions from vehicles in developing countries such as China and India in terms of global emissions from newly registered vehicles significantly increased after 2000, but global CO2 emissions from vehicles that had survived more than 15 years in 2020 still originated mainly from developed countries such as the United States and countries in the European Union.

Therefore, turbidity and water sampling for suspended sediment concentration and sediment deposition are measured. The monitoring spans from May to October, enabling studies on seasonality and its variability over the years, and the dataset covers the whole fjord, including the inner basins in close proximity to the glaciers. 
 Several climate-driven processes take place in the Arctic fjords. These include ice–ocean interactions, biodiversity and ocean circulation pattern changes, and coastal erosion phenomena. Conducting long-term oceanographic monitoring in the Arctic fjords is, therefore, essential for better understanding and predicting global environmental shifts. Here we address this issue by introducing a new hydrographic dataset from Hornsund, a fjord located in the southwestern part of the Svalbard archipelago. Hydrographic properties have been monitored with vertical temperature, salinity and depth profiles in several locations across the Hornsund fjord from 2015 to 2023. From 2016 onward, dissolved oxygen and turbidity data are available for the majority of casts. The dataset contributes to the so far infrequent observations, especially in spring and autumn, and extends the observations, typically concentrated in the central fjord, to the areas adjacent to the tidewater glaciers. Because sediment discharge from glaciers and land is an inseparable part of the glacier–ocean interactions, the suspended sediment concentration in the water column and the daily sedimentation rate adjacent to the tidewater glaciers are monitored with regular water sampling and bottom-moored sediment traps. Here we present the planning and execution of the monitoring campaign from the collection of the data to the postprocessing methods. All datasets are publicly available in the repositories referred to in the “Data availability” section of this paper."

Here, we investigated the mechanism linking the above three aspects with the dose range relevant to low-level exposure in children. At 0.5 μg/kg bw/day, we found remarkable liver and gut inflammatory responses after 6-week exposure in mice age comparable to humans 7–12 years old. Through antioxidant intervention, we found that ROS played a driver role in macrophage polarization and inflammatory responses induced by DON in the liver and gut. Further bioinformatics analysis uncovered that ER stress-associated protein MAPK7 (ERK5) may bind with AhR to initiate a mitochondrial ROS burst and macrophage M1 polarization. The downstream cellular events of MAPK7-AhR interaction may be mediated by the AhR/STAT3/p-STAT(Ser727) pathway. This mechanism was further supported by DON toxicity mitigation using cyanidin-3-glucoside (C-3-G), which docks to MAPK7 oligomerization region 200–400 aa and disrupts MAPK7-AhR interaction.

Although thiosulfate ozonation has been studied since the 1950s, challenges remain in developing a realistic reaction mechanism that can satisfactorily account for all observed products with a sequence of elementary reaction steps. Here, we present novel measurements using trapped microdroplets to study the pH-dependent thiosulfate ozonation kinetics. We detect known products and intermediates, including SO32–, SO42–, S3O62–, and S4O62–, establishing agreement with the literature. However, we identify S2O42– as a new reaction intermediate and find that the currently accepted mechanism does not directly explain observed pH effects. Thus, we develop a new mechanism, which incorporates S2O42– as an intermediate and uses elementary steps to explain the pH dependence of thiosulfate ozonation. The proposed mechanism is tested using a kinetic model benchmarked to the experiments presented here, then compared to literature data. We demonstrate good agreement between the proposed thiosulfate ozonation mechanism and experiments, suggesting that the insights in this paper can be leveraged in wastewater treatment and in understanding potential climate impacts."

These energy sources, often referred to as “clean energy”, generate no operational onsite GHG emissions. They also offer the potential for clean hydrogen production through water electrolysis, presenting a viable solution to create an environmentally friendly alternative energy carrier with the potential to decarbonize industrial processes reliant on hydrogen. To conduct a full life cycle analysis, it is crucial to account for the embodied emissions associated with renewable and nuclear power generation plants as they can significantly impact the GHG emissions linked to hydrogen production and its derived products. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the embodied emissions associated with solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, hydro, and nuclear electricity. We investigated the implications of including plant-embodied emissions in the overall emission estimates of electrolysis hydrogen production and subsequently on the production of synthetic ammonia, methanol, and Fischer–Tropsch (FT) fuels. Results show that average embodied GHG emissions of solar PV, wind, hydro, and nuclear electricity generation in the United States (U.S.) were estimated to be 37, 9.8, 7.2, and 0.3 g CO2 e/kWh, respectively. Life cycle GHG emissions of electrolytic hydrogen produced from solar PV, wind, and hydroelectricity were estimated as 2.1, 0.6, and 0.4 kg of CO2 e/kg of H2, respectively, in contrast to the zero-emissions often used when the embodied emissions in their construction were excluded. Average life cycle emission estimates (CO2 e/kg) of synthetic ammonia, methanol, and FT-fuel from solar PV electricity are increased by 5.5, 16, and 49 times, respectively, compared to the case when embodied emissions are excluded. This change also depends on the local irradiance for solar power, which can result in a further increase of GHG emissions by 35–41% in areas of low irradiance or reduce GHG emissions by 21–25% in areas with higher irradiance."

So far, only a few bacterial isolates were recently found to degrade acesulfame efficiently. In Bosea and Chelatococcus strains, a Mn2+-dependent metallo-β-lactamase-type sulfatase and an amidase signature family enzyme catalyze acesulfame hydrolysis via acetoacetamide-N-sulfonate to acetoacetate. Here, we describe a new acesulfame sulfatase in Shinella strains isolated from wastewater treatment plants in Germany. Their genomes do not encode the Mn2+-dependent sulfatase. Instead, a formylglycine-dependent sulfatase gene was found, together with the acetoacetamide-N-sulfonate amidase gene on a plasmid shared by all known acesulfame-degrading Shinella strains. Heterologous expression, proteomics, and size exclusion chromatography corroborated the physiological function of the Shinella sulfatase in acesulfame hydrolysis. Since both acesulfame sulfatase types are absent in other bacterial genomes or metagenome-assembled genomes, we surveyed 73 tera base pairs of wastewater-associated metagenome raw data sets. Bosea/Chelatococcus sulfatase gene signatures were regularly found from 2013, particularly in North America, Europe, and East Asia, whereas Shinella sulfatase gene signatures were first detected in 2020. Moreover, signatures for the Shinella sulfatase and amidase genes co-occur only in six data sets from China, Finland, and Mexico, suggesting that the Shinella genes were enriched or introduced quite recently in wastewater treatment facilities."

CO2 data can be used to estimate outdoor air change rate (ACH) based on the mass balance principle, which can be further linked to human health, performance, and building energy consumption. This study used a novel machine learning method to automatically segment CO2 concentration time series data into build-up, equilibrium, and decay periods, and then estimated classroom ACH using the corresponding CO2 mass balance equations. This method, applied to 40 classrooms in two mechanically ventilated K-6 schools, generated up to ten ACH estimates per day per classroom. A comparison with ACH calculated using the mechanical ventilation rates with 100% outdoor air reported by the building automation system during the study period reveals a slight underestimation by the decay and build-up methods, while the equilibrium method produced closer estimates. These differences may be attributed to uncertainties in occupancy, activity, CO2 emission rates, and air mixing. This research underscores the potential of leveraging CO2 data for more comprehensive IAQ assessments and highlights the challenges associated with accurately estimating ACH in real-world settings."

Technology advancements, e.g., vacuum tubing sap collection systems, reverse osmosis (RO), and electric evaporators have changed the way syrup is produced, resulting in widespread variability in processing equipment and sugar-making operational decisions. This paper evaluates these complex operations through a cradle-to-retail gate carbon footprinting model and by capturing variability in a series of producer archetypes. By isolating energy and emissions impacts, we find that implementing RO has the largest reduction effect on energy (54–77%) and emissions (57–82%), depending on both production size and evaporator fuel (wood, fuel-oil, or electricity). Results also demonstrate the effect of production scale on cumulative energy demand (CED) and emissions per gallon of syrup, with small producers ranging from 333–1,425 MJ/gal and 27–118 kg CO2e/gal (61–90% biogenic on-site) for wood-fired operations and 18–65 kg CO2e/gal for oil-fired operations.

Therefore, this study describes the development and evaluation of a generic physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model for acute exposure to OP pesticides in rats and humans using quantitative structure property relationships and data from published in vitro studies. The models were evaluated using in vivo studies from the literature for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, fenitrothion, methyl-parathion, ethyl-parathion, dimethoate, chlorfenvinphos, and profenofos. Evaluation was performed by comparing simulated and in vivo observed time profiles for blood, plasma, or urinary concentrations and other toxicokinetic parameters. Of simulated concentration–time profiles, 87 and 91% were within a 5-fold difference from observed toxicokinetic data from rat and human studies, respectively. Only for dimethyl-organophosphates further refinement of the model is required. It is concluded that the developed generic PBK model provides a new tool to assess species differences in rat and human kinetics of OP pesticides.

Here, we use a coupled ocean‐biogeochemical model to investigate differing responses to chlorophyll‐induced solar absorption between Pacific and Atlantic coastal upwelling regions. Chlorophyll‐induced solar absorption leads to colder Pacific coastal upwelling but warmer Atlantic coastal upwelling. In the Pacific, the shading effect of the surface chlorophyll maximum leads to colder subsurface water, which is then upwelled, contributing to cooling. The more stratified upper ocean leads to shallower mixed layer depth, intensifying offshore transport and upwelling. In the Atlantic, the absorption of SR by the subsurface chlorophyll maximum causes warmer and weaker upwelling.

Thus, there is greater inward absolute vorticity flux to sustain the inner eyewall. Besides, the equivalent potential temperature (θe) budget indicates that the vertical advection and surface flux of moist entropy can overbalance the negative contribution from the horizontal advection and lead to an increasing trend of θe in the inner eyewall. This suggests that the thermodynamic process in the boundary layer is not indispensable to the inner eyewall weakening. It is also found that the contraction rate of the secondary eyewall, which directly influences the moat width, is subject to the activity of outer spiral rainbands. By directly introducing positive wind tendency outside the eyewall and indirectly promoting a vertically tilted eyewall structure, active convection in the outer region will impede or even suspend the contraction of the outer eyewall and hence extend the ERC timescale."

Staar;Ugur Ozturk;Cesar Berrospi;Thomas Brunschwiler;Thorsten Wagener,Wealth Over Woe: Global Biases in Hydro‐Hazard Research,"Floods, droughts, and rainfall‐induced landslides are hydro‐hazards that affect millions of people every year. Anticipation, mitigation, and adaptation to these hazards is increasingly outpaced by their changing magnitude and frequency due to climate change. A key question for society is whether the research we pursue has the potential to address knowledge gaps and to reduce potential future hazard impacts where they will be most severe. We use natural language processing, based on a new climate hazard taxonomy, to review, identify, and geolocate out of 100 million abstracts those that deal with hydro‐hazards. We find that the spatial distribution of study areas is mostly defined by human activity, national wealth, data availability, and population distribution. Hydro‐hazard events that impact large numbers of people lead to increased research activity, but with a strong disparity between low‐ and high‐income countries. We find that 100 times more people need to be affected by hazards before low‐income countries reach comparable research activity to high‐income countries. This “Wealth over Woe” bias needs to be addressed by enabling and targeting research on hydro‐hazards in highly impacted and under‐researched regions, or in those sufficiently socio‐hydrologically similar. We urgently need to reduce knowledge base biases to mitigate and adapt to changing hydro‐hazards if we want to achieve a sustainable and equitable future for all global citizens."

A Multidimensional Accounting Method,"Biodiversity credits are increasingly recognized as a potential instrument to incentivize and bolster efforts in biodiversity conservation. Nevertheless, their efficacy is impeded by a dearth of research. To mitigate these constraints, this study introduces a comprehensive and integrated framework for appraising biodiversity credits. Drawing upon the Emergy Accounting methodology, the framework encompasses four key perspectives: Emergy‐based Ecosystem Potential (EEP), Emergy‐based Ecosystem Network (EEN), Emergy‐based “Species' to Human” contributions (ESH), and Emergy‐based Species' Significance. Furthermore, this study scrutinizes the trajectory of biodiversity credits across 31 provinces spanning from 2000 to 2050, considering 220 distinct scenarios. The findings reveal that China has attained the no net loss (NNL) objective concerning conventional area‐based conservation targets, with forest cover encompassing 27% of the total land area. However, biodiversity credits at the ecosystem level exhibit an escalating trend, with growth rates ranging from 0.73% to 1.0%, while credits at the species level depict a decremental trend, with an approximate growth rate of −0.21%. Under a scenario of moderate growth, projections for the year 2030 indicate that the EEP credit is poised to accrue approximately 4.76E + 20 solar emjoules (sej), the EEN credit is forecasted to accumulate around 1.03E + 21 sej, and the ESH credit is anticipated to decline by 1.46E + 23 sej within the context of the NNL paradigm. These outcomes underscore the necessity of delineating differentiated biodiversity goals, and furnish insights into the dynamics of supply and demand pertaining to biodiversity credits within the ambit of offsetting schemes across the nation."

Hyster,Emergence of a distinct mechanism of C–N bond formation in photoenzymes,"Emergence of a distinct mechanism of C–N bond formation in photoenzymes 
 C–N bond formation is integral to modern chemical synthesis due to the ubiquity of nitrogen heterocycles in small-molecule pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Alkene hydroamination with unactivated alkenes is an atom economical strategy for constructing these bonds. However, these reactions are challenging to render asymmetric when preparing fully substituted carbon stereocenters. Here, we report a photoenzymatic alkene hydroamination to prepare 2,2-disubstituted pyrrolidines by a Baeyer-Villiger Monooxygenase. Five rounds of protein engineering afforded a mutant, providing excellent product yield and stereoselectivity. Unlike related photochemical hydroaminations, which rely on the oxidation of the amine or alkene for C–N bond formation, this work exploits a through-space interaction of a reductively generated benzylic radical and the nitrogen lone pair. This antibonding interaction lowers the oxidation potential of the radical, enabling electron transfer to the flavin cofactor. Experiments indicate that the enzyme microenvironment is essential in enabling a novel C–N bond formation mechanism with no parallel in small molecule catalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the substrate in the enzyme active site which further support this hypothesis. This work is a rare example of an emerging mechanism in non-natural biocatalysis, where an enzyme has access to a mechanism that its individual components do not. Our study showcases the potential of enhancing emergent mechanisms using protein engineering to provide unique mechanistic solutions to unanswered challenges in chemical synthesis."

 Water is essential to the formation of intracontinental granites, but its origin remains elusive. Here we address this scientific problem by analyzing D/H isotopes of apatites, hydrous minerals in Jurassic and Early Cretaceous granites and basalts from eastern North China Craton, where water was previously interpreted as derived from subducting slab. Results reveal extremely low δD values in pristine Early Cretaceous granitic (−203‰ to −127‰) and basaltic (−197‰ to −107‰) apatites, contrasting with relatively high δD values (−137‰ to −47‰) in Jurassic granites. Given the depth-dependent D/H isotopic fractionation during slab dehydration and high-water contents in coeval primitive mafic magmas, the Early Cretaceous magma water is attributed to the stagnant slab within the mantle transition zone. Secular change in the depth of water aligns with steepening of subducting Paleo-Pacific plate from Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, demonstrating the potential of apatite H isotopes in tracing water origin in granites and basalts.

 Since the release of AlphaFold, researchers have actively refined its predictions and attempted to integrate it into existing pipelines for determining protein structures. These efforts have introduced a number of functionalities and optimisations at the latest Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction edition (CASP15), resulting in a marked improvement in the prediction of multimeric protein structures. However, AlphaFold’s capability of predicting large protein complexes is still limited and integrating experimental data in the prediction pipeline is not straightforward. In this study, we introduce AF_unmasked to overcome these limitations. Our results demonstrate that AF_unmasked can integrate experimental information to build larger or hard to predict protein assemblies with high confidence. The resulting predictions can help interpret and augment experimental data. This approach generates high quality (DockQ score > 0.8) structures even when little to no evolutionary information is available and imperfect experimental structures are used as a starting point. AF_unmasked is developed and optimised to fill incomplete experimental structures (structural inpainting), which may provide insights into protein dynamics. In summary, AF_unmasked provides an easy-to-use method that efficiently integrates experiments to predict large protein complexes more confidently.

 Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions were predicted theoretically as the quantum dual to Josephson oscillations. A significant consequence of this prediction is the emergence of quantized current steps, so-called dual Shapiro steps, when synchronizing Bloch oscillations to an external microwave signal. These steps potentially enable a fundamental standard of current I, defined via the frequency f of the external signal and the elementary charge e, I = ± n × 2ef, where n is a natural number. Here, we realize this fundamental relation by synchronizing the Bloch oscillations in small Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junctions to sinusoidal drives with frequencies from 1 to 6 GHz and observe dual Shapiro steps up to I ≈ 3 nA. Inspired by today’s voltage standards and to further confirm the duality relation, we investigate a pulsed drive regime and observe an asymmetric pattern of dual Shapiro steps. This work confirms quantum duality effects in Josephson junctions and paves the way towards a range of applications in quantum metrology based on well-established fabrication techniques and straightforward circuit design.

Electrical control of tunneling electrons between Au tip and MoS2 monolayer facilitates the dynamic switching of neutral exciton- and trion-dominant states at the nanoscale.

Furthermore, by obtaining a time-resolved second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that this electrically-driven nanoscale exciton-trion interconversion achieves a modulation frequency of up to 8 MHz.

 The transition towards low-carbon societies is creating winners and losers, raising new questions of justice. Around the world, litigation increasingly articulates these justice questions, challenging laws, projects and policies that aim to deliver climate change adaptation and/or mitigation. In this Perspective, we define and conceptualize the phenomenon of ‘just transition litigation’. This concept provides a new frame for identifying and understanding the diverse justice claims of those affected by climate action. We set out a research agenda to further investigate this phenomenon, with a view to enhancing societal acceptance and support for the transition.

 Deep convection in the Indo-Pacific warm pool is vital in driving global atmospheric overturning circulations. Year-to-year variations in the strength and location of warm pool precipitation can lead to significant local and downstream hydroclimatic impacts, including floods and droughts. While the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is recognized as a key factor in modulating interannual precipitation variations in this region, atmospheric internal variability is often as important. Here, through targeted atmospheric model experiments, we identify an intrinsic low-frequency atmospheric mode in the warm pool region during the austral summer, and show that its impact on seasonal rainfall is comparable to ENSO. This mode resembles the horizontal structure of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and may play a role in initiating ENSO as stochastic forcing. We show that this mode is not merely an episodic manifestation of MJO events but primarily arises from barotropic energy conversion aided by positive feedback between convection and circulation."

 The East African Rift is one of Earth’s largest continental landforms. It is recognized as a critical region for understanding hominin evolution yet has also undergone important transformation through ongoing tectonic and volcanic activity. An understanding of the interplay of rift kinematics, magma genesis and geomorphic evolution requires firm geochronology but this has been lacking for much of the East African Rift. Here we present detailed stratigraphic observations and high-precision 40Ar/39Ar ages for major volcanic units in the Central Main Ethiopian Rift. Our new data identify a volumetrically major episode of explosive volcanism between circa 3.85–3.42 million years ago, after aproximately 5-million years-long quiescence. Four other pulses followed but with intensity and magnitude declining over time.

 This research investigates the environmental sustainability of three integrated power cycles: combined geothermal-wind, combined solar-geothermal, and combined solar-wind. Here, a promising solar technology, the perovskite solar cell, is considered and analysed in conjunction with another renewable-based cycle, evaluating 17 scenarios focusing on improving the efficiency and lifespan. Among the base cases, combined solar-wind had the lowest ozone depletion impact, while combined geothermal-wind had the lowest freshwater ecotoxicity and marine ecotoxicity impacts. The study shows that extending the perovskite solar cell lifespan from 3 to 15 years reduces CO2 emissions by 28% for the combined solar-geothermal and 56% for the combined solar-wind scenario. The most sustainable cases in ozone depletion, marine ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, and climate change impacts are combined solar-wind, combined solar-geothermal, and combined geothermal-wind, respectively, among all evaluated scenarios.

 Global warming significantly alters lake ecosystems worldwide. However, the effects of warming at a regional scale are often overlooked due to the scarcity of multidecadal to centennial regional studies. Here, we examined diatom sedimentary records from five lakes on São Miguel Island (Azores archipelago) over the last 170 years. Our analysis using hierarchical generalised additive models revealed an abrupt shift in the island-wide diatom community around 1982 CE, when the Northern Hemisphere temperature exceeded 0.35 °C above the 20th-century mean. This community regime shift resulted in a 27% loss in regional diatom diversity across the Island. Furthermore, previous anthropogenic impacts may have enhanced lakes’ rapid response to warming. These findings highlight the vulnerability of freshwater island ecosystems to climate warming and emphasise the importance of transitioning from local to regional assessments to preserve regional resilience and prevent irreversible damage to these essential freshwater resources and their biodiversity.

Pavelsky,Using river hypsometry to improve remote sensing of river discharge,"•We present an algorithm to estimate fluvial hypsometric curves. •We use 2 m-pixel commercial imagery to measure river height and width. •We estimate discharge for six river reaches in the North American Arctic. •Constraining height and width to fluvial hypsometry improves discharge. 
 Remote sensing has the potential to dramatically advance river discharge monitoring globally, but precision of primary data (water surface elevation (WSE) and river width) remains a limiting factor. WSE can be measured from altimeters, and river width from imagers, but the measurements historically have not been made concurrently from space. This is changing with the advent of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission and is anticipated by the combination of high-resolution commercial imagery and DEMs from ArcticDEM. WSE and width respond to changing flow conditions as modulated by the three-dimensional structure of the river channel bed and banks. The relationship between WSE and width thus increases monotonically and is essentially the hypsometric curve of the river. In this study, we explore how simultaneous measurements of WSE and width, combined with the monotonic nature of the river hypsometric curve, can be used to improve measurements of river discharge. First, we present an algorithm to compute the river hypsometric curve from noisy measurements of WSE and width. Second, we demonstrate a method to compute estimates of WSE and width constrained to the river hypsometric curve, and we analyze the probability distribution function of the hypsometrically constrained WSE and width estimates. Specifically, we show that the variance of width and WSE is reduced by invoking a hypsometric constraint, at the cost of an induced correlation between the WSE and width errors. Third, we show that river discharge estimated with the hypsometrically constrained WSE and width is more precise than that without hypsometric constraint, and we predict the expected reduction in discharge error. Fourth, we look at six example river reaches measured by ArcticDEM. The WSE root mean square error had a median across the six reaches of 39.3 cm, which was improved to 33.4 cm across the six reaches using the hypsometric constraint. The discharge predictions were similarly improved: the constrained height and width produce more accurate discharge estimates for five of the six reaches and show reduced variation among flow laws. With the launch of SWOT, river hypsometry constraints applied to simultaneous measurement of WSE and width will support new discharge estimates globally."

 The wave spectrum describes the distribution of wave energy across frequency and direction. Obtaining wave spectrum information with high accuracy is of great value for oceanographic research and disaster prevention and reduction. Currently, wave spectral data can be obtained from remote sensing observations, global meteorological and climate reanalysis products, and in-situ observations, which exhibit different advantages and limitations in terms of spatio-temporal resolution, accuracy, and data coverage. Fusing these diverse spectral data to complement the advantage of improving the accuracy of wave spectrum is very promising. However, there is still no simple and effective method to fuse the above spectral data. In this study, a multi-source spectral fusion method is developed based on BU-NET, which realizes the integration of ERA5 spectra and SWIM spectra, with buoy spectra as the reference. The results of the systematic evaluation indicate that the fusion spectra alleviate parasitic peaks, address the issue of larger mean energy, and compensate for energy loss due to the cutoff frequency in the SWIM spectra. The fusion spectra also alleviate energy underestimation during high sea states in the ERA5 spectra. Furthermore, the accuracy of the significant wave height, mean wave period, dominant wave period, and dominant wave direction obtained from the fusion spectra is improved. The root mean square errors between these parameters from the fusion spectra and those from buoy spectra are 0.217 m, 0.378 s, 1.599 s, and 33.094°, respectively."

 There is a need to help farmers make decisions to maximize crop yields. Many studies have emerged in recent years using deep learning on remotely sensed images to detect plant diseases, which can be caused by multiple factors such as environmental conditions, genetics or pathogens. This problem can be considered as an anomaly detection task. However, these approaches are often limited by the availability of annotated data or prior knowledge of the existence of an anomaly. In many cases, it is not possible to obtain this information. In this work, we propose an approach that can detect plant anomalies without prior knowledge of their existence, thus overcoming these limitations. To this end, we train a model on an auxiliary prediction task using a dataset composed of samples of normal and abnormal plants. Our proposed method studies the distribution of heatmaps retrieved from an explainability model. Based on the assumptions that the model trained on the auxiliary task is able to extract important plant characteristics, we propose to study how closely the heatmap of a new observation follows the heatmap distribution of a normal dataset. Through the proposed a contrario approach, we derive a score indicating potential anomalies.Experiments show that our approach outperforms reference approaches such as f-AnoGAN and OCSVM on the GrowliFlower and PlantDoc datasets and has competitive performances on the PlantVillage dataset, while not requiring the prior knowledge on the existence of anomalies."

 Snow plays a critical role in modulating surface energy, water cycles, and climate prediction. Optimizing snow-related parameterizations can enhance the model behaviors in simulating snow-related physical processes and reduce the cold bias observed in winter climate simulations in the Northern Hemisphere. In this study, the topographic complexity and wind speed were incorporated into the parameterization of the snow cover fraction (SCF) and newly fallen snow density (SFD) respectively within the Noah with multi-parameterization (Noah-MP) LSM to optimize the simulation of snow-related processes in the mid-latitude regions of East Asia. A control simulation and three sensitivity experiments were conducted to investigate and quantify the effects of topographic complexity and wind speed on the simulation of snow-related processes and land surface temperature (LST) against MODIS products. The results showed that modifications to the two schemes effectively mitigated the overestimation of snow cover and albedo, and alleviated cold biases in the most of study area. The influence of SFD scheme considering wind speed was more pronounced in regions with more snowfall and higher wind speed, while the SCF scheme considering topographic complexity showed a more widespread effect. The combination of these two modified schemes yielded the best performance. The mean biases of SCF, albedo, and LST over the entire study region with both modified schemes were reduced by 0.126 (∼63 %), 0.044 (∼41 %), and 0.584 °C (∼18 %), respectively.

 Using ERA-Interim reanalysis data and ensemble forecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), we explore the roles of the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex throughout the life cycle of the 2016 East Asian cold air outbreak (CAO). Our results reveal the distinct roles of the stratosphere in the initiation and intensification stages of this CAO. The occurrence of this CAO was directly related to an exceptionally strong Ural blocking ridge that advected cold air mass toward East Asia. Notably, the strengthening of Ural blocking is largely influenced by the behavior of the stratospheric polar vortex. Specifically, the contraction of the polar vortex toward the western Urals paved the way for reflecting planetary waves originating from the North Atlantic via changing the buoyancy frequency just above the tropopause. The reflected waves converged over the western Urals and acted to strengthen Ural blocking that in turn affected this CAO. Subsequently, an elongation of the polar vortex toward East Asia was observed, leading to a significant descent of the tropopause over East Asia. According to the invertibility theory of potential vorticity, the descending tropopause likely induced a cyclonic anomaly over East Asia, further contributing to the intensification of this CAO. However, the impact of this cyclonic anomaly induced by the polar vortex elongation is relatively limited compared to the influence of Ural blocking. In summary, our study highlights that the geometry of the polar vortex, rather than its strength, is crucial in understanding the stratospheric impacts on the 2016 East Asian CAO."

 Understanding and assessing the spatiotemporal patterns in crop-specific phosphorus (P) fertilizer management are crucial for enhancing crop yield and mitigating environmental problems. The existing P fertilizer dataset, derived from sales data, depicts an average application rate over total cropland at the county level but overlooks cross-crop variations. Conversely, the survey-based dataset offers crop-specific application details at the state level yet lacks inter-state variability. By reconciling these two datasets, we developed long-term gridded maps to characterize crop-specific P fertilizer application rates, timing, and methods across the contiguous US at a resolution of 4 km × 4 km from 1850 to 2022. We found that P fertilizer application rate over fertilized areas in the US increased from 0.9 g P m−2 yr−1 in 1940 to 1.9 g P m−2 yr−1 in 2022, with substantial variations among crops. However, approximately 40 % of cropland nationwide has remained unfertilized in the recent decade. The hotspots for P fertilizer use have shifted from the southeastern and eastern US to the Midwest and the Great Plains over the past century, reflecting changes in cropland area, crop choices, and P fertilizer use across different crops. Pre-planting (fall and spring) and broadcast application are prevalent among corn, soybean, and cotton in the Midwest and the Southeast, indicating a high P loss risk in these regions. In contrast, wheat and barley in the Great Plains receive the most intensive P fertilization at planting and via non-broadcast application. The P fertilizer management dataset developed in this study can advance our comprehension of agricultural P budgets and facilitate the refinement of best P fertilizer management practices to optimize crop yield and to reduce P loss.

Evaluations in central Spain show that RASCAL outperforms ERA20C reanalysis in reconstructing precipitation and temperature. RASCAL offers opportunities for broad scientific applications, from short-term forecasts to local-scale climate change scenarios. 
 The reduction of in situ observations over the last few decades poses a potential risk of losing important information in regions where local effects dominate the climatology. Reanalyses face challenges in representing climatologies with highly localized effects, especially in regions with complex orography. Empirical downscaling methods offer a cost-effective and easier-to-implement alternative to dynamic downscaling methods and can partially overcome the aforementioned limitations of reanalyses by taking into account the local effects through statistical relationships. This article introduces RASCAL (Reconstruction by AnalogS of ClimatologicAL time series), an open-source Python tool designed to extend time series and fill gaps in observational climate data, especially in regions with limited long-term data and significant local effects, such as mountainous areas.Employing an object-oriented programming style, RASCAL's methodology effectively links large-scale circulation patterns with local atmospheric features using the analog method in combination with principal component analysis (PCA).The package contains routines for preprocessing observations and reanalysis data, generating reconstructions using various methods, and evaluating the reconstruction's performance in reproducing the time series of observations, statistical properties, and relevant climatic indices. Its high modularity and flexibility allow fast and reproducible downscaling. The evaluations carried out in central Spain, in mountainous and urbanized areas, demonstrate that RASCAL performs better than the ERA20C and ERA20CM reanalysis, as expected, in terms of R2, standard deviation, and bias. When analyzing reconstructions against observations, RASCAL generates series with statistical properties, such as seasonality and daily distributions, that closely resemble observations. This confirms the potential of this method for conducting robust climate research. The adaptability of RASCAL to diverse scientific objectives is also highlighted. However, as with any other method based on empirical training, this method requires the availability of sufficiently long-term data series. Furthermore, it is susceptible to disruption caused by changes in land use or urbanization processes that might compromise the homogeneity of the training data. Despite these limitations, RASCAL's positive outcomes offer opportunities for comprehensive climate variability analyses and potential applications in downscaling short-term forecasts, seasonal predictions, and climate change scenarios. The Python code and the Jupyter Notebook for the reconstruction validation are publicly available as an open project."

Properly calibrating model parameters is essential, and although automated tools can speed up this process, they may occasionally produce incorrect values due to inconsistencies in the model. We demonstrate that by carefully applying automated tools, we were able to identify and correct a flaw in a widely used model for lake environments. 
 Models are simplified descriptions of reality and are intrinsically limited by the assumptions that have been introduced in their formulation. With the development of automatic calibration toolboxes, finding optimal parameters that suit the environmental system has become more convenient. Here, we explore how optimization toolboxes can be applied innovatively to uncover flaws in the physical formulations of models. We illustrate this approach by evaluating the effect of simplifications embedded in the formulation of a widely used hydro-thermodynamic model. We calibrate a Delft3D model based on temperature profiles for a case study, Lake Morat (Switzerland), through the optimization tool DYNO-PODS. Results show that neglecting the fraction β of shortwave radiation absorbed at the water surface can be compensated by higher values of the light extinction coefficient. This leads to unrealistic values of the latter parameter, as the optimization pushes the coefficient towards the limit of no transparency, consistent with the need to reproduce a significant absorption at the surface. While it is well-known that β is significantly larger than zero, its absence in the model was never noticed as critical. The extensive use of automatic calibration tools may offer similar outcomes in other applications."

We used detailed models, finding that forecasts at Baring Head improved significantly due to its strong tidal currents, but changes at Banks Peninsula were minimal. The study demonstrates that local conditions greatly influence the effectiveness of wave prediction models, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in coastal forecasting to enhance accuracy in the predictions. 
 This study evaluates the effects of downscaling, source terms, and tidal interactions on numerical wave forecasts in Aotearoa New Zealand. We utilised a set of three nested domains (from global to regional scale) to examine significant wave height (Hs), mean period (Tm01), and peak wave direction at two coastal locations, Banks Peninsula and Baring Head. Downscaling markedly improved forecast accuracy at Baring Head, a tidally constricted region, reducing Hs forecast error by 25 %. However, improvements at Banks Peninsula were minimal, likely due to its open coast characteristics which are adequately represented even by lower resolution models. Source term enhancements using default ST6 parameters generally improved Hs predictions on the west coast but worsened them on the east, indicating a geographical dependency in model performance. This variability was also evident in the Tm01 predictions, with notable improvements in bias reduction through model downscaling, particularly at Baring Head. Tidal influences were significant, especially at Baring Head, where they enhanced the forecast accuracy of wave height and direction due to the strong tidal currents characteristic of this location. In contrast, at Banks Peninsula, tidal effects were less pronounced. The study underscores the importance of tailored modelling approaches that consider local geographical and hydrodynamic conditions to optimise wave forecasting."

Herein, the three-month dynamic degradation process of BPs (the copolymer of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) and polylactic acid (PLA) (PBAT/PLA) and single PLA) in a natural aquatic environment was investigated, with nonbiodegradable plastics polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, and polystyrene as controls. PBAT/PLA showed the weight loss of 47.4% at 50 days and severe fragmentation within two months, but no significant decay for other plastics. The significant increase in the specific surface area and roughness and the weakening of hydrophobicity within the first month promoted microbial attachment to the PBAT/PLA surface. Then, a complete microbial succession occurred, including biofilm formation, maturation, and dispersion. Metagenomic analysis indicated that plastispheres selectively enriched degraders. Based on the functional genes involved in BPs degradation, a total of 16 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes of degraders (mainly Burkholderiaceae) were recovered from the PBAT/PLA plastisphere.

The mechanisms controlling terrOC preservation are not completely understood, while lateral oxygen exposure time (OET) is considered as a critical controlling factor. Here, we first utilized molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural properties of lignin under anoxic, suboxic, and oxic conditions for understanding the mechanisms of terrOC preservation during sediment lateral transport in the ocean. Our finding suggested that oxygen exposure was indispensable for terrOC degradation through influencing the structural stability and reactivity of lignin. Our simulated results showed that in suboxic environments, prolonged OET may enhance terrOC preservation. Our organic geochemical results suggested that terrOC preferably preserved in coarse silts (20–63 μm) than fine silts (<20 μm) in suboxic environments, largely due to hydrodynamics-driven prolonged OET in coarse sediments, which may efficiently reduce CO2 emissions. Overall, our study sheds new light on the mechanisms of lateral OETs on terrOC preservation in suboxic conditions and, from a unique molecular structural perspective, provides insights into the impact of prolonged OETs on terrOC oxidative degradation in the marine environment."

Among the 19 screened OPEs, CDP bound to PPARγ with the highest binding potency, followed by TPHP. CDP activated PPARγ through fitting into the binding pocket with strong hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond interactions; CDP exhibited higher potency compared to TPHP. In 3T3-L1 cells, CDP enhanced the PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis activity, exhibiting greater potency than TPHP. The intracellular concentration and receptor-bound concentrations (RBC) of CDP were also higher than those of TPHP in both HEK293 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. In mice, exposure to CDP activated the PPARγ-mediated adipogenic pathway, leading to an increased white adipose tissue weight gain. Overall, CDP could bind to and activate PPARγ, thereby promoting preadipocyte differentiation and the development of white adipose tissue. Its potential obesogenic risks should be of high concern."

This study selected carbamazepine (CBZ), a prevalent aquatic antiepileptic drug that degrades negligibly at 254 nm, to investigate its photodegradation mechanisms at 222 nm. Accelerated CBZ treatment by 222 nm far-UVC was mainly attributed to in situ ROS generation via self-sensitized photodegradation of CBZ. By quenching experiments and EPR tests, •OH radicals were identified as the major contributor to the CBZ photodegradation, whereas O2•– played a minor role. By deoxygenation and solvent exchange experiments, the H2O molecules were demonstrated to play a crucial role in deactivating the excited singlet state of CBZ (1CBZ*) at 222 nm: generating •OH radicals via electron transfer interactions with 1CBZ*. In addition, 1CBZ* could also undergo a photoionization process. The transformation products and pathways of CBZ at 222 nm were proposed, and the toxicities of CBZ’s products were predicted.

Gas analyses indicated that the carbon dioxide and methane emissions were enhanced in FA treatment, which increased up to 94.08-fold and 5.06-fold, respectively. 15N-labeling experiments revealed that nitrogen fixation capability was promoted (1.2-fold) to reduce the carbon and nitrogen imbalance due to fulvic acid amendment. Metagenomic analysis further revealed that gene abundances of degradation of lignin-like compounds, gallate degradation, methanogenesis, nitrogen fixation, and urea hydrolysis increased, while the bacterial ammonia oxidation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation decreased, caused by FA application. Metabolic reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that Azospirillaceae, Methanosarcinaceae, and Bathyarchaeota, with higher abundance in FA treatment, were the key microorganisms to maintain the carbon and nitrogen balance.

Yet, conventional molecular models typically represent only single-slit pores and overlook the complexity of interconnected nanopores. In this work, finite kaolinite lamellar assemblages with abundant nanopores (r < 2 nm) were used. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to quantify the spatial distribution correlations, adsorption preference, diffusivity, and residence time of the CO2 molecules in kaolinite nanopores. The movement of the CO2 molecules primarily occurs in the central and proximity regions of the siloxane surfaces, progressing from larger to smaller nanopores. CO2 prefers smaller nanopores over larger ones. The diffusion coefficients increase, while residence times decrease, with the pore size increasing, differing from typical slit-pore models due to the pore shape and interconnectivity.

To address this gap, we develop an economic adaptive decision‐making framework that takes into account future learning about sea level rise uncertainty and apply it to a coastal case study in Lübeck, Germany, to answer the question of how adaptation to sea level rise can be improved through adaptive adaptation pathways as opposed to non‐adaptive pathways. To address this question, we use a Markov decision process to formulate the stochastic optimization problem. We quantify future learning about sea level rise uncertainty through sea level rise learning scenarios based on and validated against the latest scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our case study results show that the city of Lübeck is currently under‐protected against storm surges and that immediate adaptation actions are advisable in the face of future sea level rise.

 Animals must navigate changing environments to find food, shelter or mates. In mammals, grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex construct a neural spatial map of the external environment1–5. However, how grid cell firing patterns rapidly adapt to novel or changing environmental features on a timescale relevant to behaviour remains unknown. Here, by recording over 15,000 grid cells in mice navigating virtual environments, we tracked the real-time state of the grid cell network. This allowed us to observe and predict how altering environmental features influenced grid cell firing patterns on a nearly instantaneous timescale. We found evidence that visual landmarks provide inputs to fixed points in the grid cell network. This resulted in stable grid cell firing patterns in novel and altered environments after a single exposure. Fixed visual landmark inputs also influenced the grid cell network such that altering landmarks induced distortions in grid cell firing patterns. Such distortions could be predicted by a computational model with a fixed landmark to grid cell network architecture. Finally, a medial entorhinal cortex-dependent task revealed that although grid cell firing patterns are distorted by landmark changes, behaviour can adapt via a downstream region implementing behavioural timescale synaptic plasticity6. Overall, our findings reveal how the navigational system of the brain constructs spatial maps that balance rapidity and accuracy. Fixed connections between landmarks and grid cells enable the brain to quickly generate stable spatial maps, essential for navigation in novel or changing environments. Conversely, plasticity in regions downstream from grid cells allows the spatial maps of the brain to more accurately mirror the external spatial environment. More generally, these findings raise the possibility of a broader neural principle: by allocating fixed and plastic connectivity across different networks, the brain can solve problems requiring both rapidity and representational accuracy. How the navigational system of the brain constructs spatial maps that require both rapid changes and representational accuracy is explored."

 Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor1. Optical atomic clocks2, the current state of the art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology3–6. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection7–10 with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing11,12 offers a promising route towards making use of highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and use a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schrödinger cat states of the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to nine optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit (SQL) using GHZ states of up to four qubits. However, because of their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared with unentangled atoms13. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval14–17. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.

 Ferroelectric structures have spontaneous macroscopic polarization that can be inverted using external electric fields and have potential applications including information storage, energy transduction, ultralow-power nanoelectronics1,2 and biomedical devices3. These functions would benefit from nanoscale control of ferroelectric structure, the ability to switch polarization with lower applied fields (low coercive field) and biocompatibility. Soft ferroelectrics based on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)4–6 have a thermodynamically unstable ferroelectric phase in the homopolymer, complex semi-crystalline structures, and high coercive fields. Here we report on ferroelectric materials formed by water-soluble molecules containing only six VDF repeating units covalently conjugated to a tetrapeptide, with the propensity to assemble into the β-sheet structures that are ubiquitous in proteins. This led to the discovery of ribbon-shaped ferroelectric supramolecular assemblies that are thermodynamically stable with their long axes parallel to both the preferred hydrogen-bonding direction of β-sheets and the bistable polar axes of VDF hexamers. Relative to a commonly used ferroelectric copolymer, the biomolecular assemblies exhibit a coercive field that is two orders of magnitude lower, as the result of supramolecular dynamics, and a similar level of remnant polarization, despite having a peptide content of 49 wt%. Furthermore, the Curie temperature of the assemblies is about 40 °C higher than that of a copolymer containing a similar amount of VDF. This supramolecular system was created using a biologically inspired strategy that is attractive in terms of sustainability and that could lead to new functions for soft ferroelectrics.

 Massive stars are predominantly born in stellar associations or clusters1. Their radiation fields, stellar winds and supernovae strongly impact their local environment. In the first few million years of a cluster’s life, massive stars are dynamically ejected and run away from the cluster at high speed2. However, the production rate of dynamically ejected runaways is poorly constrained. Here we report on a sample of 55 massive runaway stars ejected from the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. An astrometric analysis of Gaia data3–5 reveals two channels of dynamically ejected runaways. The first channel ejects massive stars in all directions and is consistent with dynamical interactions during and after the birth of R136. The second channel launches stars in a preferred direction and may be related to a cluster interaction. We found that 23–33% of the most luminous stars initially born in R136 are runaways. Model predictions2,6,7 have significantly underestimated the dynamical escape fraction of massive stars. Consequently, their role in shaping and heating the interstellar and galactic media and their role in driving galactic outflows are far more important than previously thought8,9.

 Plasmids are major drivers of gene mobilization by means of horizontal gene transfer and play a key role in spreading antimicrobial resistance among pathogens1,2. Despite various bacterial defence mechanisms such as CRISPR–Cas, restriction–modification systems and SOS-response genes that prevent the invasion of mobile genetic elements3, plasmids robustly transfer within bacterial populations through conjugation4,5. Here we show that the leading region of plasmids, the first to enter recipient cells, is a hotspot for an extensive repertoire of anti-defence systems, encoding anti-CRISPR, anti-restriction, anti-SOS and other counter-defence proteins. We further identified in the leading region a prevalence of promoters known to allow expression from single-stranded DNA6, potentially facilitating rapid protection against bacterial immunity during the early stages of plasmid establishment. We demonstrated experimentally the importance of anti-defence gene localization in the leading region for efficient conjugation. These results indicate that focusing on the leading region of plasmids could lead to the discovery of diverse anti-defence genes. Combined, our findings show a new facet of plasmid dissemination and provide theoretical foundations for developing efficient conjugative delivery systems for natural microbial communities.

 Global emission reduction efforts continue to be insufficient to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement1. This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that temporarily exceed a targeted global warming limit before drawing temperatures back down to safer levels a priority for science and policy2–5. Here we show that global and regional climate change and associated risks after an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it. We find that achieving declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes. However, the possibility that global warming could be reversed many decades into the future might be of limited relevance for adaptation planning today. Temperature reversal could be undercut by strong Earth-system feedbacks resulting in high near-term and continuous long-term warming6,7. To hedge and protect against high-risk outcomes, we identify the geophysical need for a preventive carbon dioxide removal capacity of several hundred gigatonnes. Yet, technical, economic and sustainability considerations may limit the realization of carbon dioxide removal deployment at such scales8,9. Therefore, we cannot be confident that temperature decline after overshoot is achievable within the timescales expected today. Only rapid near-term emission reductions are effective in reducing climate risks.

 Mate recognition systems evolve rapidly to reinforce the reproductive boundaries between species, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we leveraged the rapid coevolution of female pheromone production and male pheromone perception in Drosophila1,2 to gain insight into how the architecture of mate recognition circuits facilitates their diversification. While in some Drosophila species females produce unique pheromones that act to arouse their conspecific males, the pheromones of most species are sexually monomorphic such that females possess no distinguishing chemosensory signatures that males can use for mate recognition3. We show that Drosophila yakuba males evolved the ability to use a sexually monomorphic pheromone, 7-tricosene, as an excitatory cue to promote courtship. By comparing key nodes in the pheromone circuits across multiple Drosophila species, we reveal that this sensory innovation arises from coordinated peripheral and central circuit adaptations: a distinct subpopulation of sensory neurons has acquired sensitivity to 7-tricosene and, in turn, selectively signals to a distinct subset of P1 neurons in the central brain to trigger courtship. Such a modular circuit organization, in which different sensory inputs can independently couple to parallel courtship control nodes, may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing novel sensory modalities to become linked to male arousal. Together, our findings suggest how peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly coordinated to underlie the rapid evolution of mate recognition strategies across species. Peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly coordinated in Drosophila, and such a modular circuit organization may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing novel sensory modalities to become linked to male arousal."

 Olfaction is a fundamental sensory modality that guides animal and human behaviour1,2. However, the underlying neural processes of human olfaction are still poorly understood at the fundamental—that is, the single-neuron—level. Here we report recordings of single-neuron activity in the piriform cortex and medial temporal lobe in awake humans performing an odour rating and identification task. We identified odour-modulated neurons within the piriform cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In each of these regions, neuronal firing accurately encodes odour identity. Notably, repeated odour presentations reduce response firing rates, demonstrating central repetition suppression and habituation. Different medial temporal lobe regions have distinct roles in odour processing, with amygdala neurons encoding subjective odour valence, and hippocampal neurons predicting behavioural odour identification performance. Whereas piriform neurons preferably encode chemical odour identity, hippocampal activity reflects subjective odour perception. Critically, we identify that piriform cortex neurons reliably encode odour-related images, supporting a multimodal role of the human piriform cortex. We also observe marked cross-modal coding of both odours and images, especially in the amygdala and piriform cortex. Moreover, we identify neurons that respond to semantically coherent odour and image information, demonstrating conceptual coding schemes in olfaction. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between animal models and non-invasive human studies and advance our understanding of odour processing in the human brain by identifying neuronal odour-coding principles, regional functional differences and cross-modal integration.

 The rate of river migration affects the stability of Arctic infrastructure and communities1,2 and regulates the fluxes of carbon3,4, nutrients5 and sediment6,7 to the oceans. However, predicting how the pace of river migration will change in a warming Arctic8 has so far been stymied by conflicting observations about whether permafrost9 primarily acts to slow10,11 or accelerate12,13 river migration. Here we develop new computational methods that enable the detection of riverbank erosion at length scales 5–10 times smaller than the pixel size in satellite imagery, an innovation that unlocks the ability to quantify erosion at the sub-monthly timescales when rivers undergo their largest variations in water temperature and flow. We use these high-frequency observations to constrain the extent to which erosion is limited by the thermal condition of melting the pore ice that cements bank sediment14, a requirement that will disappear when permafrost thaws, versus the mechanical condition of having sufficient flow to transport the sediment comprising the riverbanks, a condition experienced by all rivers15. Analysis of high-resolution data from the Koyukuk River, Alaska, shows that the presence of permafrost reduces erosion rates by 47%. Using our observations, we calibrate and validate a numerical model that can be applied to diverse Arctic rivers. The model predicts that full permafrost thaw may lead to a 30–100% increase in the migration rates of Arctic rivers.

 The movement of large amounts of nutrients by migrating animals has ecological benefits for recipient food webs1,2 that may be offset by co-transported contaminants3,4. Salmon spawning migrations are archetypal of this process, carrying marine-derived materials to inland ecosystems where they stimulate local productivity but also enhance contaminant exposure5–7. Pacific salmon abundance and biomass are higher now than in the last century, reflecting substantial shifts in community structure8 that probably altered nutrient versus contaminant delivery. Here we combined nutrient and contaminant concentrations with 40 years of annual Pacific salmon returns to quantify how changes in community structure influenced marine to freshwater inputs to western North America. Salmon transported tonnes of nutrients and kilograms of contaminants to freshwaters annually. Higher salmon returns (1976–2015) increased salmon-derived nutrient and contaminant inputs by 30% and 20%, respectively. These increases were dominated by pink salmon, which are short-lived, feed lower in marine food webs than other salmon species, and had the highest nutrient-to-contaminant ratios. As a result, the delivery of nutrients increased at a greater rate than the delivery of contaminants, and salmon inputs became more ecologically beneficial over time. Even still, contaminant loadings may represent exposure concerns for some salmon predators. The Pacific salmon example demonstrates how long-term environmental changes interact with nutrient and contaminant movement across large spatial scales and provides a model for exploring similar patterns with other migratory species9.

 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are luminous bursts of soft X-rays from the nuclei of galaxies, repeating on timescales of hours to weeks1–5. The mechanism behind these rare systems is uncertain, but most theories involve accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing instabilities6–8 or interacting with a stellar object in a close orbit9–11. It has been suggested that this disk could be created when the SMBH disrupts a passing star8,11, implying that many QPEs should be preceded by observable tidal disruption events (TDEs). Two known QPE sources show long-term decays in quiescent luminosity consistent with TDEs4,12 and two observed TDEs have exhibited X-ray flares consistent with individual eruptions13,14. TDEs and QPEs also occur preferentially in similar galaxies15. However, no confirmed repeating QPEs have been associated with a spectroscopically confirmed TDE or an optical TDE observed at peak brightness. Here we report the detection of nine X-ray QPEs with a mean recurrence time of approximately 48 h from AT2019qiz, a nearby and extensively studied optically selected TDE16. We detect and model the X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission from the accretion disk and show that an orbiting body colliding with this disk provides a plausible explanation for the QPEs.

 The human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex play critical roles in learning and cognition1,2, yet the dynamic molecular characteristics of their development remain enigmatic. Here we investigated the epigenomic and three-dimensional chromatin conformational reorganization during the development of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, using more than 53,000 joint single-nucleus profiles of chromatin conformation and DNA methylation generated by single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing (snm3C-seq3)3. The remodelling of DNA methylation is temporally separated from chromatin conformation dynamics. Using single-cell profiling and multimodal single-molecule imaging approaches, we have found that short-range chromatin interactions are enriched in neurons, whereas long-range interactions are enriched in glial cells and non-brain tissues. We reconstructed the regulatory programs of cell-type development and differentiation, finding putatively causal common variants for schizophrenia strongly overlapping with chromatin loop-connected, cell-type-specific regulatory regions. Our data provide multimodal resources for studying gene regulatory dynamics in brain development and demonstrate that single-cell three-dimensional multi-omics is a powerful approach for dissecting neuropsychiatric risk loci.

Churchill,Dietary restriction impacts health and lifespan of genetically diverse mice,"Health effects of dietary restriction are uncoupled from longevity. 
 Caloric restriction extends healthy lifespan in multiple species1. Intermittent fasting, an alternative form of dietary restriction, is potentially more sustainable in humans, but its effectiveness remains largely unexplored2–8. Identifying the most efficacious forms of dietary restriction is key for developing interventions to improve human health and longevity9. Here we performed an extensive assessment of graded levels of caloric restriction (20% and 40%) and intermittent fasting (1 and 2 days fasting per week) on the health and survival of 960 genetically diverse female mice. We show that caloric restriction and intermittent fasting both resulted in lifespan extension in proportion to the degree of restriction. Lifespan was heritable and genetics had a larger influence on lifespan than dietary restriction. The strongest trait associations with lifespan included retention of body weight through periods of handling—an indicator of stress resilience, high lymphocyte proportion, low red blood cell distribution width and high adiposity in late life. Health effects differed between interventions and exhibited inconsistent relationships with lifespan extension. 40% caloric restriction had the strongest lifespan extension effect but led to a loss of lean mass and changes in the immune repertoire that could confer susceptibility to infections. Intermittent fasting did not extend the lifespan of mice with high pre-intervention body weight, and two-day intermittent fasting was associated with disruption of erythroid cell populations. Metabolic responses to dietary restriction, including reduced adiposity and lower fasting glucose, were not associated with increased lifespan, suggesting that dietary restriction does more than just counteract the negative effects of obesity. Our findings indicate that improving health and extending lifespan are not synonymous and raise questions about which end points are the most relevant for evaluating aging interventions in preclinical models and clinical trials. Health effects of dietary restriction are uncoupled from longevity."

 Multivesicular bodies are key endosomal compartments implicated in cellular quality control through their degradation of membrane-bound cargo proteins1–3. The ATP-consuming ESCRT protein machinery mediates the capture and engulfment of membrane-bound cargo proteins through invagination and scission of multivesicular-body membranes to form intraluminal vesicles4,5. Here we report that the plant ESCRT component FREE16 forms liquid-like condensates that associate with membranes to drive intraluminal vesicle formation. We use a minimal physical model, reconstitution experiments and in silico simulations to identify the dynamics of this process and describe intermediate morphologies of nascent intraluminal vesicles. Furthermore, we find that condensate-wetting-induced line tension forces and membrane asymmetries are sufficient to mediate scission of the membrane neck without the ESCRT protein machinery or ATP consumption. Genetic manipulation of the ESCRT pathway in several eukaryotes provides additional evidence for condensate-mediated membrane scission in vivo. We find that the interplay between condensate and machinery-mediated scission mechanisms is indispensable for osmotic stress tolerance in plants. We propose that condensate-mediated scission represents a previously undescribed scission mechanism that depends on the physicomolecular properties of the condensate and is involved in a range of trafficking processes. More generally, FREE1 condensate-mediated membrane scission in multivesicular-body biogenesis highlights the fundamental role of wetting in intracellular dynamics and organization.

 Behavioural time scale plasticity (BTSP) is non-Hebbian plasticity induced by integrating presynaptic and postsynaptic components separated by a behaviourally relevant time scale (seconds)1. BTSP in hippocampal CA1 neurons underlies place cell formation. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable synapse-specific plasticity on a behavioural time scale are unknown. Here we show that BTSP can be induced in a single dendritic spine using two-photon glutamate uncaging paired with postsynaptic current injection temporally separated by a behavioural time scale. Using an improved Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) sensor, we did not detect CaMKII activation during this BTSP induction. Instead, we observed dendritic, delayed and stochastic CaMKII activation (DDSC) associated with Ca2+ influx and plateau potentials 10–100 s after BTSP induction. DDSC required both presynaptic and postsynaptic activity, which suggests that CaMKII can integrate these two signals. Also, optogenetically blocking CaMKII 15–30 s after the BTSP protocol inhibited synaptic potentiation, which indicated that DDSC is an essential mechanism of BTSP. IP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ release facilitated both DDSC and BTSP. Thus, our study suggests that non-synapse-specific CaMKII activation provides an instructive signal with an extensive time window over tens of seconds during BTSP.

 Advanced urothelial cancer is a frequently lethal disease characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity1. In this study, we investigated the evolution of genomic signatures caused by endogenous and external mutagenic processes and their interplay with complex structural variants (SVs). We superimposed mutational signatures and phylogenetic analyses of matched serial tumours from patients with urothelial cancer to define the evolutionary dynamics of these processes. We show that APOBEC3-induced mutations are clonal and early, whereas chemotherapy induces mutational bursts of hundreds of late subclonal mutations. Using a genome graph computational tool2, we observed frequent high copy-number circular amplicons characteristic of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)-forming SVs. We characterized the distinct temporal patterns of APOBEC3-induced and chemotherapy-induced mutations within ecDNA-forming SVs, gaining new insights into the timing of these mutagenic processes relative to ecDNA biogenesis. We discovered that most CCND1 amplifications in urothelial cancer arise within circular ecDNA-forming SVs. ecDNA-forming SVs persisted and increased in complexity, incorporating additional DNA segments and contributing to the evolution of treatment resistance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read whole-genome sequencing followed by de novo assembly mapped out CCND1 ecDNA structure. Experimental modelling of CCND1 ecDNA confirmed its role as a driver of treatment resistance. Our findings define fundamental mechanisms that drive urothelial cancer evolution and have important therapeutic implications.

 For patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with CTLA4 inhibitors and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (hereafter, PD-(L)1 inhibitors) is associated with higher rates of anti-tumour activity and immune-related toxicities, when compared with treatment with PD-(L)1 inhibitors alone. However, there are currently no validated biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit from dual ICB1,2. Here we show that patients with NSCLC who have mutations in the STK11 and/or KEAP1 tumour suppressor genes derived clinical benefit from dual ICB with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab and the CTLA4 inhibitor tremelimumab, but not from durvalumab alone, when added to chemotherapy in the randomized phase III POSEIDON trial3. Unbiased genetic screens identified loss of both of these tumour suppressor genes as independent drivers of resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition, and showed that loss of Keap1 was the strongest genomic predictor of dual ICB efficacy—a finding that was confirmed in several mouse models of Kras-driven NSCLC. In both mouse models and patients, KEAP1 and STK11 alterations were associated with an adverse tumour microenvironment, which was characterized by a preponderance of suppressive myeloid cells and the depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but relative sparing of CD4+ effector subsets. Dual ICB potently engaged CD4+ effector cells and reprogrammed the tumour myeloid cell compartment towards inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-expressing tumoricidal phenotypes that—together with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells—contributed to anti-tumour efficacy. These data support the use of chemo-immunotherapy with dual ICB to mitigate resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition in patients with NSCLC who have STK11 and/or KEAP1 alterations. Alterations in the tumour suppressor genes STK11 and/or KEAP1 can identify patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who are likely to benefit from combinations of PD-(L)1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint inhibitors added to chemotherapy."

 Enhancing the precision of measurements by harnessing entanglement is a long-sought goal in quantum metrology1,2. Yet attaining the best sensitivity allowed by quantum theory in the presence of noise is an outstanding challenge, requiring optimal probe-state generation and read-out strategies3–7. Neutral-atom optical clocks8, which are the leading systems for measuring time, have shown recent progress in terms of entanglement generation9–11 but at present lack the control capabilities for realizing such schemes. Here we show universal quantum operations and ancilla-based read-out for ultranarrow optical transitions of neutral atoms. Our demonstration in a tweezer clock platform9,12–16 enables a circuit-based approach to quantum metrology with neutral-atom optical clocks. To this end, we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates with 99.62(3)% fidelity—averaged over symmetric input states—through Rydberg interactions15,17,18 and dynamical connectivity19 for optical clock qubits, which we combine with local addressing16 to implement universally programmable quantum circuits. Using this approach, we generate a near-optimal entangled probe state1,4, a cascade of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states of different sizes, and perform a dual-quadrature5 Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger read-out. We also show repeated fast phase detection with non-destructive conditional reset of clock qubits and minimal dead time between repetitions by implementing ancilla-based quantum logic spectroscopy20 for neutral atoms. Finally, we extend this to multi-qubit parity checks and measurement-based, heralded, Bell-state preparation21–24. Our work lays the foundation for hybrid processor–clock devices with neutral atoms and more generally points to a future of practical applications for quantum processors linked with quantum sensors25.

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and has the highest rate of recurrence1. The predominant standard of care for advanced TNBC is systemic chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy; however, responses are typically short lived1,2. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments. Components of the PI3K pathway represent plausible therapeutic targets; more than 70% of TNBCs have alterations in PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN3–6. However, in contrast to hormone-receptor-positive tumours, it is still unclear whether or how triple-negative disease will respond to PI3K pathway inhibitors7. Here we describe a promising AKT-inhibitor-based therapeutic combination for TNBC. Specifically, we show that AKT inhibitors synergize with agents that suppress the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and promote robust tumour regression in multiple TNBC models in vivo. AKT and EZH2 inhibitors exert these effects by first cooperatively driving basal-like TNBC cells into a more differentiated, luminal-like state, which cannot be effectively induced by either agent alone. Once TNBCs are differentiated, these agents kill them by hijacking signals that normally drive mammary gland involution. Using a machine learning approach, we developed a classifier that can be used to predict sensitivity. Together, these findings identify a promising therapeutic strategy for this highly aggressive tumour type and illustrate how deregulated epigenetic enzymes can insulate tumours from oncogenic vulnerabilities. These studies also reveal how developmental tissue-specific cell death pathways may be co-opted for therapeutic benefit.

 Undesired coupling to the surrounding environment destroys long-range correlations in quantum processors and hinders coherent evolution in the nominally available computational space. This noise is an outstanding challenge when leveraging the computation power of near-term quantum processors1. It has been shown that benchmarking random circuit sampling with cross-entropy benchmarking can provide an estimate of the effective size of the Hilbert space coherently available2–8. Nevertheless, quantum algorithms’ outputs can be trivialized by noise, making them susceptible to classical computation spoofing. Here, by implementing an algorithm for random circuit sampling, we demonstrate experimentally that two phase transitions are observable with cross-entropy benchmarking, which we explain theoretically with a statistical model. The first is a dynamical transition as a function of the number of cycles and is the continuation of the anti-concentration point in the noiseless case. The second is a quantum phase transition controlled by the error per cycle; to identify it analytically and experimentally, we create a weak-link model, which allows us to vary the strength of the noise versus coherent evolution. Furthermore, by presenting a random circuit sampling experiment in the weak-noise phase with 67 qubits at 32 cycles, we demonstrate that the computational cost of our experiment is beyond the capabilities of existing classical supercomputers. Our experimental and theoretical work establishes the existence of transitions to a stable, computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum processors.

Schäfer;Elena Conti,Structural basis of mRNA decay by the human exosome–ribosome supercomplex,"The structure of a human exosome–ribosome supercomplex reveals the mechanisms behind the formation of active cytoplasmic exosomes and their role in co-translational RNA decay. 
 The interplay between translation and mRNA decay is widespread in human cells1–3. In quality-control pathways, exonucleolytic degradation of mRNA associated with translating ribosomes is mediated largely by the cytoplasmic exosome4–9, which includes the exoribonuclease complex EXO10 and the helicase complex SKI238 (refs. 10–16). The helicase can extract mRNA from the ribosome and is expected to transfer it to the exoribonuclease core through a bridging factor, HBS1L3 (also known as SKI7), but the mechanisms of this molecular handover remain unclear7,17,18. Here we reveal how human EXO10 is recruited by HBS1L3 (SKI7) to an active ribosome-bound SKI238 complex. We show that rather than a sequential handover, a direct physical coupling mechanism takes place, which culminates in the formation of a cytoplasmic exosome–ribosome supercomplex. Capturing the structure during active decay reveals a continuous path in which an RNA substrate threads from the 80S ribosome through the SKI2 helicase into the exoribonuclease active site of the cytoplasmic exosome complex. The SKI3 subunit of the complex directly binds to HBS1L3 (SKI7) and also engages a surface of the 40S subunit, establishing a recognition platform in collided disomes. Exosome and ribosome thus work together as a single structural and functional unit in co-translational mRNA decay, coordinating their activities in a transient supercomplex. The structure of a human exosome–ribosome supercomplex reveals the mechanisms behind the formation of active cytoplasmic exosomes and their role in co-translational RNA decay."

Here, the authors show that the Attribute Neutral Framework reduces these biases and enhances fairness without compromising diagnostic accuracy. 
 Questions of unfairness and inequity pose critical challenges to the successful deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare settings. In AI models, unequal performance across protected groups may be partially attributable to the learning of spurious or otherwise undesirable correlations between sensitive attributes and disease-related information. Here, we introduce the Attribute Neutral Framework, designed to disentangle biased attributes from disease-relevant information and subsequently neutralize them to improve representation across diverse subgroups. Within the framework, we develop the Attribute Neutralizer (AttrNzr) to generate neutralized data, for which protected attributes can no longer be easily predicted by humans or by machine learning classifiers. We then utilize these data to train the disease diagnosis model (DDM). Comparative analysis with other unfairness mitigation algorithms demonstrates that AttrNzr outperforms in reducing the unfairness of the DDM while maintaining DDM’s overall disease diagnosis performance. Furthermore, AttrNzr supports the simultaneous neutralization of multiple attributes and demonstrates utility even when applied solely during the training phase, without being used in the test phase. Moreover, instead of introducing additional constraints to the DDM, the AttrNzr directly addresses a root cause of unfairness, providing a model-independent solution. Our results with AttrNzr highlight the potential of data-centered and model-independent solutions for fairness challenges in AI-enabled medical systems. Unfairness in AI healthcare models arise from biased correlations between sensitive attributes and disease data.

 Eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4B is required for efficient cap-dependent translation, it is overexpressed in cancer cells, and may influence stress granule formation. Due to the high degree of intrinsic disorder, eIF4B is rarely observed in cryo-EM structures of translation complexes and only ever by its single structured RNA recognition motif domain, leaving the molecular details of its large intrinsically disordered region (IDR) unknown. By integrating experiments and simulations we demonstrate that eIF4B IDR orchestrates and fine-tunes an intricate transition from monomers to a condensed phase, in which large-size dynamic oligomers form before mesoscopic phase separation. Single-molecule spectroscopy combined with molecular simulations enabled us to characterize the conformational ensembles and underlying intra- and intermolecular dynamics across the oligomerization transition. The observed sensitivity to ionic strength and molecular crowding in the self-association landscape suggests potential regulation of eIF4B nanoscopic and mesoscopic behaviors such as driven by protein modifications, binding partners or changes to the cellular environment. This study reveals how the intrinsically disordered region of eIF4B governs its transition from monomers to oligomers and condensed droplets, providing key insights into how its self-association may be regulated to carry out its cellular functions."

Here, the authors show that a population of cells that express Vasa2 and Piwi1 genes can generate both germ and somatic cells, for example neurons, in a sea anemone. 
 Germline segregation, essential for protecting germ cells against mutations, occurs during early embryogenesis in vertebrates, insects and nematodes. Highly regenerative animals (e.g., cnidarians), however, retain stem cells with both germinal and somatic potentials throughout adulthood, but their biology and evolution remain poorly understood. Among cnidarians (e.g., sea anemones, jellyfish), stem cells are only known in few hydrozoans (e.g., Hydra). Here, we identify and characterize a rare, multipotent population of stem and/or progenitor cells expressing the conserved germline and multipotency proteins Vasa2 and Piwi1 in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Using piwi1 and vasa2 transgenic reporter lines, we reveal that the Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cell population generates not only gametes, but also a diversity of proliferative somatic cells, including neural progenitors, in juveniles and adults. Our work has uncovered a multipotent population of Vasa2+/Piwi1+ stem/progenitor cells that forms the cellular basis to understand body plasticity and regenerative capacities in sea anemones and corals.

 RNAs and their encoded proteins intricately regulate diverse cell types and states within the human body. Dysregulated RNA expressions or mutations can lead to various diseased cell states, including tumorigenesis. Detecting and manipulating these endogenous RNAs offers significant promise for restoring healthy cell states and targeting tumors both in research and clinical contexts. This study presents an RNA-IN and RNA-OUT genetic circuit capable dynamically sensing and manipulating any RNA target in a programmable manner. The RNA-IN module employes a programmable CRISPR-associated protease (CASP) complex for RNA detection, while the RNA-OUT module utilizes an engineered protease-responsive dCas9-VPR activator. Additionally, the CASP module can detect point mutations by harnessing an uncovered dual-nucleotide synergistic switching effect within the CASP complex, resulting in the amplification of point-mutation signals from initially undetectable levels (1.5-fold) to a remarkable 94-fold. We successfully showcase the circuit’s ability to rewire endogenous RNA-IN signals to activate endogenous progesterone biosynthesis pathway, dynamically monitor adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the epithelial-to-mesenchmal trans-differentiation, as well as selective killing of tumor cells. The programmable RNA-IN and RNA-OUT circuit exhibits tremendous potential for applications in gene therapy, biosensing and design of synthetic regulatory networks.

Here, authors designed carbon nitride-supported single-atom iron catalysts, with a tandem catalytic process, for microplastic degradation and green hydrogen production. 
 Microplastic pollution, an emerging environmental issue, poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. In tackling microplastic pollution and advancing green hydrogen production, this study reveals a tandem catalytic microplastic degradation-hydrogen evolution reaction (MPD-HER) process using hierarchical porous carbon nitride-supported single-atom iron catalysts (FeSA-hCN). Through hydrothermal-assisted Fenton-like reactions, we accomplish near-total ultrahigh-molecular-weight-polyethylene degradation into C3-C20 organics with 64% selectivity of carboxylic acid under neutral pH, a leap beyond current capabilities in efficiency, selectivity, eco-friendliness, and stability over six cycles. The system demonstrates versatility by degrading various daily-use plastics across different aquatic settings. The mixture of FeSA-hCN and plastic degradation products further achieves a hydrogen evolution of 42 μmol h‒1 under illumination, outperforming most existing plastic photoreforming methods. This tandem MPD-HER process not only provides a scalable and economically feasible strategy to combat plastic pollution but also contributes to the hydrogen economy, with far-reaching implications for global sustainability initiatives.

 Moiré superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures represent a highly tunable quantum system, attracting substantial interest in both many-body physics and device applications. However, the influence of the moiré potential on light-matter interactions at room temperature has remained largely unexplored. In our study, we demonstrate that the moiré potential in MoS2/WSe2 heterobilayers facilitates the localization of interlayer exciton (IX) at room temperature. By performing reflection contrast spectroscopy, we demonstrate the importance of atomic reconstruction in modifying intralayer excitons, supported by the atomic force microscopy experiment. When decreasing the twist angle, we observe that the IX lifetime becomes longer and light emission gets enhanced, indicating that non-radiative decay channels such as defects are suppressed by the moiré potential. Moreover, through the integration of moiré superlattices with silicon single-mode cavities, we find that the devices employing moiré-trapped IXs exhibit a significantly lower threshold, one order of magnitude smaller compared to the device utilizing delocalized IXs. These findings not only encourage the exploration of many-body physics in moiré superlattices at elevated temperatures but also pave the way for leveraging these artificial quantum materials in photonic and optoelectronic applications. The authors observe that the atomic reconstruction in MoS2/WSe2 heterobilayers with large lattice mismatch results in the most significant periodic strain distribution, contributing to the effective localisation of excitons within moiré potential traps at room temperature."

 Marine silicate alteration exerts a major influence on marine carbon and cation cycles, but has proven difficult to quantify. In this context, silicon isotopes of marine pore fluids became an important tracer. However, poorly constrained silicon isotope signatures of precipitates produced during silicate alteration (i.e. authigenic clays) remain a major source of uncertainty. Here we present in situ silicon isotope analyses of marine authigenic clays (intergrown iron-smectites and iron-glauconites) occurring within recent sediments from the Oregon margin, eastern North Pacific. We identify a trend to lower silicon isotopes (from −2.24‰ to −3.17‰), accompanied by decreasing aluminum/silicon ratios and increasing potassium oxide contents, which we interpret as an isotopic shift caused by progressive clay maturation via dissolution-reprecipitation reactions. Our modelling suggests that this clay maturation pathway, together with mixing of other fluid sources, may induce pore fluid silicon isotope shifts of up to −1.7‰, if sufficient newly precipitated clays are re-dissolved. This could potentially produce silicon isotopes values significantly lower than seawater and implies that conventional isotope-based approaches underestimate the prevalence of marine silicate alteration. Our findings highlight that clay maturation must be considered when interpreting silicon isotope signatures in terms of marine silicate alteration and upscaling to global element cycles.

 Methane hydrates on continental margins sequester substantial amounts of methane. Ocean warming often triggers hydrate dissociation, influencing global climate and marine ecosystems. Here we use ocean reanalysis to investigate bottom marine heatwaves affecting methane seeps at the Northwest Atlantic continental margin. These heatwaves are driven by downward displacement of ocean subsurface isopycnals that brings anomalously warm water to the seafloor, which frequently lacked surface expressions. The isopycnal anomalies are generated by the interaction of Gulf Stream mesoscale activity and slope topography, including warm core ring intrusions and impingements at the tail of the Grand Banks. Once generated, the isopycnal anomalies propagate along the slope and affect the seep area via topographic Rossby waves, offering predictability for bottom marine heatwaves. A northward shift and increasing instability of the Gulf Stream has intensified bottom marine heatwaves at the seep area since 2009, and future climate change will likely exacerbate this trend.

 The intraplate magmatic systems of the Wudalianchi potassic volcanic region in northeast China have historically exhibited eruption activity, and there is evidence that they retain the potential for future eruptions. However, the characteristics of this complex volcanic region remain debated and poorly understood due to the relatively low resolution of existing crustal tomography. Here we present a high-resolution shear-wave velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle obtained by applying full-waveform ambient noise tomography to data recorded at 106 recently deployed broadband seismic stations. Our results reveal two vertical low-velocity anomalies discovered beneath the Nuominhe and Keluo volcanoes, which appear to be magma ascending pathways connecting a mantle source and crustal reservoirs. A horizontally interconnected low-velocity zone in the middle-lower crust indicates a magmatic migration pathway transporting potassium-rich melts directly among the potassic volcanic units. In addition, the Wudalianchi volcano is likely recharged by deeper and larger crustal magma reservoirs under the Keluo volcano. The unique geometries of the magmatic plumbing systems provide valuable seismic evidence for the volcanic eruption dynamics and potential volcanic hazards.

 The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is one of the world's most important agricultural regions. Over recent decades, the declining trend in precipitation has caused more frequent droughts over the northern plateau of the GMS, and this has led to a significant reduction in agricultural productivity. These drought events can also affect agriculture within the middle and lower parts of the Mekong River basin. To reveal the main causes of the decline in precipitation, this study investigates interdecadal variations in summer precipitation over the northern GMS during 1979–2022. Results indicate that summer conditions over the northern GMS entered a relatively dry period after the late 1990s. The interdecadal decrease in summer precipitation is closely associated with the warming of the northern Arabian Sea (AS), which induces a cyclonic anomaly that enhances local precipitation and associated diabatic heating. The anomalous diabatic heating induces a downstream Rossby wave train that intensifies the circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) pattern and causes the South Asian high (SAH) to extend farther southeastwards. The southeastward-displaced SAH induces easterly anomalies over the northern Bay of Bengal (BOB) that weaken the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) southwesterly flows and reduce moisture transport from the northern BOB to the northern GMS. The southeastward displacement of the SAH also causes anomalous descent over the northern GMS. Both conditions result in reduced precipitation over the northern GMS. Numerical experiments substantiate the proposed modulating role of AS warming in the interdecadal decrease in summer precipitation over the northern GMS."

We identified the μ2 subunit of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a protein-partner of SLC26A4 involved in regulating its plasma membrane abundance. We showed that, in the endolymphatic sac, where fluid reabsorption occurs, SLC26A4 is localized along the apical microvilli of mitochondria-rich cells, in contact with the endolymph, and associated with clathrin-coated pits where μ2 and AP-2 are present. Based on SLC26A4 structure, the elements involved in SLC26A4-μ2 interaction were identified and validated experimentally, allowing modeling of this interaction at the atomic level. Pharmacological inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis led to an increased plasma membrane abundance of hemagglutinin-tagged SLC26A4 virally or endogenously expressed in mitochondria-rich cells.

Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that α-syn forms multimers on lipid membranes with huge intermultimer distances. The multimers are characterized by self-limiting growth, manifesting in concentration-dependent exchanges of monomers, which are fast at micromolar concentrations and almost stop at nanomolar concentrations. We further uncovered movement patterns of α-syn’s occasional trapping on membranes, which may be attributed to sparse lipid packing defects.

Here, we report that VGLL3 plays an important role in DNA damage response (DDR). VGLL3 can be recruited to damage sites in a PARylation-dependent manner. VGLL3 depletion impairs the accumulation of RNF8 and RAD51 at sites of DNA damage, leading to reduced homologous recombination efficiency and increased cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, VGLL3 can prevent CtIP from KLHL15-mediated ubiquitination and degradation through competitive binding with KLHL15 and, meanwhile, stabilize MDC1 by limiting TRIP12-MDC1 but promoting USP7-MDC1 associations for optimal RNF8 signaling initiation. Consistently, VGLL3 depletion delays tumor development and sensitizes the xenografts to etoposide treatment. Overall, our results reveal an unexpected role of VGLL3 in DDR, which is distinct from its transcriptional cofactor function and not conserved among VGLL family members."

Our previous research identified that quiescent adult naïve CD4+T cells express LINE1 (long interspersed nuclear elements 1) spliced in previously unknown isoforms, and their down-regulation marks the transition to activation. Here, we unveil that neonatal naïve T cell quiescence is characterized by enhanced energy production and protein synthesis. This phenotype is associated with the absence of LINE1 expression attributed to tonic T cell receptor/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1)–mediated LINE1 splicing suppression. The absence of LINE1 expression primes these cells for rapid execution of the activation program by directly regulating protein synthesis. LINE1 expression progressively increases in childhood and adults, peaking in elderly individuals, and, by decreasing protein synthesis, contributes to immune senescence in aging.

Using Predicted Particle Properties (P3), this work shows that secondary ice production processes increase the amount of ice pellets simulated while decreasing the amount of freezing rain. Moreover, the properties of the simulated precipitation compare well with those that were measured. 
 Ice pellets can form when supercooled raindrops collide with small ice particles that can be generated through secondary ice production processes. The use of atmospheric models that neglect these collisions can lead to an overestimation of freezing rain. The objective of this study is therefore to understand the impacts of collisional freezing and secondary ice production on simulations of ice pellets and freezing rain. We studied the properties of precipitation simulated with the Predicted Particle Properties (P3) microphysics scheme for two distinct secondary ice production processes. Improvements to the representation of ice pellets and ice crystals in P3 were analyzed by simulating an ice pellet storm that occurred over eastern Canada in January 2020. Those simulations showed that adding secondary ice production processes increased the accumulation of ice pellets but led to unrealistic size distributions of precipitation particles. Realistic size distributions of ice pellets were obtained by modifying the collection of raindrops by small ice particles and the merging criteria of ice categories in P3."

Here we show that climate models subject only to internal variability predict such warming spikes but rarely (p~1.6 %). However, when a prolonged La Niña immediately precedes an El Niño, as occurred leading up to 2023, such spikes are not uncommon (p~10.3 %). Virtually all of the spikes occur during an El Niño, strongly suggesting that internal variability drove the 2023 warming. 
 Global-mean surface temperature rapidly increased 0.29 ± 0.04 K from 2022 to 2023. Such a large interannual global warming spike is not unprecedented in the observational record, with a previous instance occurring in 1976–1977. However, why such large global warming spikes occur is unknown, and the rapid global warming of 2023 has led to concerns that it could have been externally driven. Here we show that climate models that are subject only to internal variability can generate such spikes, but they are an uncommon occurrence (p = 1.6 % ± 0.1 %). However, when a prolonged La Niña immediately precedes an El Niño in the simulations, as occurred in nature in 1976–1977 and 2022–2023, such spikes become much more common (p = 10.3 % ± 0.4 %). Furthermore, we find that nearly all simulated spikes (p = 88.5 % ± 0.3 %) are associated with El Niño occurring that year. Thus, our results underscore the importance of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in driving the occurrence of global warming spikes such as the one in 2023, without needing to invoke anthropogenic forcing, such as changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases or aerosols, as an explanation."

To tackle this issue, we developed a novel framework based on MEP theory. By incorporating heat storage effects and refining the Bowen ratio, we enhanced the MEP method’s accuracy. This research derives a new long-term global ocean latent heat flux dataset that offers high accuracy, enhancing our understanding of ocean energy dynamics. 
 Ocean evaporation (latent heat flux, LE) plays a crucial role in global precipitation patterns, water cycle dynamics, and energy exchange processes. However, current bulk methods for quantifying ocean evaporation are subject to significant uncertainties. The Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) theory offers a novel approach for estimating surface heat fluxes, but its effectiveness over ocean surfaces has not been validated. This study integrates heat storage effects and four empirical Bowen ratio formulas into the MEP theory to improve ocean LE estimation. We employed multi-source data from 129 globally distributed buoy stations and seven auxiliary turbulent flux datasets for validation and comparison. We first evaluated the MEP method using observed data from buoy stations, identifying the optimal Bowen ratio formula to enhance the model. Results indicate that accounting for heat storage and adjusting the Bowen ratio significantly improve heat flux accuracy, with R2=0.99 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.7 W·m-2 compared to observations. Subsequently, we conducted a thorough evaluation of seven global turbulent flux datasets to identify the most accurate input variables (e.g., heat storage, net radiation, surface temperature) for applying the MEP method on a global ocean scale. The enhanced MEP method provided new estimates of the annual average LE at 93 W·m-2 and sensible heat at 12 W·m-2 for the period 1988 to 2017. Validation against observations from 129 buoy stations demonstrated that the MEP-derived latent heat dataset achieved the highest accuracy, with a mean error (ME) of 1.3 W·m-2, an RMSE of 15.9 W·m-2, and a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.89, outperforming four major long-term global heat flux datasets, including J-OFURO3, ERA5, MERRA2, and OAFlux. Additionally, we examined the long-term spatiotemporal variability of global ocean evaporation, identifying a significant increasing trend from 1988 to 2010 at a rate of 3.58 mm/yr, followed by a decline at a rate of -2.18 mm/yr from 2010 to 2017. The current dataset provides a new benchmark for the ocean surface energy budget and is expected to be valuable for research on global ocean warming, sea surface-atmosphere energy exchange, the water cycle and climate change.

It provides valuable insights into how reservoir storage has grown by 130 % between 2008 and 2017, driven by dams in key river basins. Our data also reveal how droughts, like the 2019–2020 event, significantly impacted water reservoirs. This resource can aid water management, drought planning, and research globally. 
 The recent surge in reservoir construction has increased global surface water storage, with Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) being a significant hotspot. Such infrastructural evolution demands updates in water management strategies and hydrological models. However, information on actual reservoir storage is hard to acquire, especially for transboundary river basins. To date, no high spatio-temporal dataset on absolute storage time series is available for reservoirs in MSEA. To address this gap, we present (1) a comprehensive, open-access database of absolute storage time series (sub-monthly) for 185 reservoirs (larger than 0.1 km3) in MSEA spanning the period 1985–2023, and (2) an analysis of the reservoir storage dynamics. The MSEA-Res database includes static (Area-Elevation-Storage curves, water frequency, reservoir extent) and dynamic (area, water level, and absolute storage time series) components for each reservoir. The 185 reservoirs collectively store around 175 km³ (140 km³ – 210 km³) of water, covering an aggregated area of 8,700 km² (6,500 km² – 10,000 km²). We show that the combined average reservoir storage has increased from 70 km³ to 160 km³ (+130 %) from 2008 to 2017, primarily contributed by dams in the Irrawaddy, Red, Upper Mekong, and Lower Mekong basins. Our in-situ validation provides a good match between estimated storage and in-situ observations, with 60 % of the validation sites (12 out of 20) showing an R² > 0.65 and an average nRMSE < 15 %. The indirect validation (based on altimetry-converted storage) shows even better results, with an R² > 0.7 and an average nRMSE < 12 % for 70 % (14 out of 20) of the reservoirs. Furthermore, the analysis of the 2019–2020 drought event reveals that nearly 30–40 % of the MSEA region experienced more than five months of drought, with the most significant impact on reservoirs in Cambodia and Thailand. As a result, storage departures ranged up to -40 % in some reservoirs, highlighting significant impacts on water availability. Overall, this analysis demonstrates the potential of the inferred storage time series for assessing real-life water-related problems in Mainland Southeast Asia, with the possibility of applications in other parts of the world.

Here we present a gap-filled time series dataset of a shelf mooring array off the Western Australian coast, by adopting a machine learning tool to fill the data gaps. The gap-filled data has acceptable errors and shows consistency with observations. 
 Coastal moorings allow scientists to collect long-term datasets valuable in understanding shelf dynamics, detecting climate variability and changes, and evaluating their impacts on marine ecosystems. Continuous time series data from moorings is often disrupted due to mooring losses or instrument failures, which prevents us from obtaining complete and accurate information on the marine environment. Here, we present an updated version of the 14-year subsurface mooring dataset off the southwest coast of Western Australia during 2010–2023 (https://doi.org/10.25919/myac-yx60, Bui and Feng, 2024). This updated dataset offers continuous daily temperature and current data with a 5-meter vertical resolution, collected from six coastal Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) moorings at depths between 48 m and 500 m. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) machine learning technique is applied to fill in the data gaps in the previous version.

It was developed by translating the FORTRAN version of Noah-MP to C# code. A river routing model was integrated. It can run in parallel on Windows systems using today's PCs. The NMP-Hydro code has been tested to ensure it produces the same results as the original WRF-Hydro. Maps and changes in variables show consistent results with the original model. We think it is a reliable replacement for Noah-MP in WRF-Hydro 3.0. 
 The community Noah with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP) land surface model (LSM) that is widely used in studies from uncoupled land surface hydrometeorology and ecohydrology to coupled weather and climate predictions. In this study, we developed NMP-Hydro, a hydrological model written in CSharp(C#). NMP-Hydro was developed by faithfully translating the FORTRAN version Noah-MP from the uncoupled WRF-Hydro 3.0, and was coupled with a river routing model. NMP-Hydro exhibits the capacity of parallel execution on Windows systems, utilizing the multi-core CPUs commonly available in today's personal computers. The code of NMP-Hydro has been rigorously tested to ensure that it produces a high-degree of consistency with the simulation output of the original WRF-Hydro. High-resolution (6 km) simulations were conducted and assessed over a grid domain covering the entire Yellow River Basin and the most part of North China. The spatial maps and temporal variations of many state variables simulated by NMP-Hydro and WRF-Hydro/Noah-MP demonstrate consistent results, with occasionally minor discrepancies. The river discharge for the Yellow River under various scheme combinations of six Noah-MP parameterizations exhibits general close agreement with the natural river discharge at the Lanzhou station. NMP-Hydro can be regarded as a reliable replica of Noah-MP in WRF-Hydro 3.0, but it can leverage the modern, powerful, and user-friendly features brought by the C # language to significantly improve the efficiency of the model users and developers."

In this work, we extended the application of FLPs on CeO2(110) to the selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 (NH3–SCR), finding a notable enhancement in performance compared to ordinary CeO2(110). Additionally, an innovative approach involving H2 treatment was discovered to increase the number of FLPs, thereby further boosting the NH3–SCR efficiency. Typically, NH3–SCR on regular CeO2 follows the Eley–Rideal (E–R) mechanism. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a significant reduction in the energy barriers for the activation of N–O and N–H bonds under the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) mechanism with FLPs present. This transition shifted the reaction mechanism from the E–R pathway on regular R-CeO2 to the L-H pathway on FLP-rich FR-CeO2, as corroborated by the experimental findings. The practical application of FLPs was realized by loading MoO3 onto FLP-rich FR-CeO2, leveraging the synergistic effects of acidic sites and FLPs. This study provides profound insights into how FLPs facilitate N–H/N–O bond activation in small molecules, such as NH3 and NO, offering a new paradigm for catalyst design based on catalytic mechanism research."

A total of 369 intermittent bleed and 26 continuous low-bleed pneumatic devices were measured using a high-volume sampler. Considering all intermittent bleed devices, the emission factor from this study was statistically lower than the factor in the revised Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule (GHGRP) issued May 6, 2024. Intermittent devices were classified by inspection with an optical gas imaging camera as functioning or malfunctioning. Measurements of functioning intermittent bleed devices were statistically higher while measurements of malfunctioning intermittent bleed devices were statistically lower than the corresponding emission factor in the final revisions to the GHGRP. Measurements of continuous low-bleed pneumatic devices were statistically lower than the updated factor in the final revisions to GHGRP. Additionally, a Monte Carlo analysis was conducted to investigate the potential impact of measurement duration and sample size on emission factors derived for intermittent bleed devices. We conclude that while a short measurement duration may miss actuations of properly operating devices with low vent frequencies, potentially resulting in an emission factor with low bias, the sample size of greater than 300 measurements each greater than 3 min in duration, as included in this study, is unlikely to be biased low in a statistically significant manner, particularly when one considers the material contribution of malfunctioning devices."

The recent US federal infrastructure funding, coupled with research efforts to explore innovative, alternative decentralized wastewater systems, are unprecedented opportunities for addressing basic sanitation gaps in these communities. Yet, understanding how to best manage these systems for sustainable operations and maintenance (O&M) is still a national need. Here, we develop an integrated management approach for achieving such sustainable systems, taking into account the utility structure, operational aspects, and possible barriers impeding effective management of decentralized wastewater infrastructure. We demonstrate this approach through a binomial logistic regression of survey responses from 114 public and private management entities (e.g., water and sewer utilities) operating in 27 states in the US, targeting the rural Alabama Black Belt wastewater issues. Our assessment introduces policy areas that support sustainable decentralized wastewater systems management and operations, including privatizing water-wastewater infrastructure systems, incentivizing/mandating the consolidation of utility management of these systems, federally funding the O&M, and developing and retaining water-wastewater workforce in rural, underserved communities. Our discussions give rise to a holistic empirical understanding of effective management of decentralized wastewater infrastructure for rural, underserved communities in the US, thereby contributing to global conversations on sustainable development."

Recently, the role of miRNAs in the response of aquatic organisms to environmental stressors has emerged. Daphnia, widely distributed cladocerans, play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems. Cyanobacterial blooms often cause Daphnia populations to decrease, thereby disrupting ecosystem functionality and water quality. However, the post-transcriptional mechanisms behind Daphnia’s response to toxic cyanobacteria are insufficiently understood. This study investigated the role of miR-210, a multifunctional miRNA involved in stress response and toxicity pathways, and its target genes (MLH3, CDHR5, and HYOU1) in two Daphnia magna clones exposed to toxic Microcystis aeruginosa. Results showed that M. aeruginosa inhibited somatic growth rates, led to microcystin accumulation, caused abnormal ultrastructural alterations in the digestive tract, and induced DNA damage in both clones. Notably, exposure significantly increased miR-210 expression and decreased the expression of its target genes compared with the controls. We identified miR-210s regulation on clonal-tolerance variations in D. magna to M. aeruginosa, emphasizing miRNAs’ contribution to adaptive responses. Our work uncovered a novel post-transcriptional mechanism of cyanobacterial impact on zooplankton and provided essential insights for assessing cyanobacterial toxicity risks."

To investigate SWOT effectiveness in surface waters, we conducted two before-and-after mixed-method evaluations in a Uganda refugee settlement served by piped and trucked surface water systems. We surveyed 888 users on water knowledge, attitudes, and practices; collected 2768 water samples to evaluate FRC,Escherichia coli, and disinfection by-products (DBPs) concentrations; and conducted nine key-informant interviews with system operators about SWOT implementation. After baseline data collection, SWOT chlorination targets were generated, increasing point-of-distribution FRC targets from 0.2 to 0.7–0.8 mg/L and from 0.3 to 0.9 mg/L for piped and trucked systems, respectively. At endline, household point-of-consumption FRC ≥ 0.2 mg/L increased from 23 to 35% and from 8 to 42% in the two systems. With these increases, we did not observe increased chlorinated water rejection or DBPs concentrations exceeding international guidelines. Informants reported that SWOT implementation increased knowledge and capacity and improved operations. Overall, SWOT-generated chlorination targets increased chlorine dosage, which improved household water quality in surface waters although less than previously documented with groundwater sources.

This study addresses resource, environmental, economic, policy, and societal issues related to low-carbon hydrogen production by steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage in Wyoming and other natural-gas-rich states. For low-carbon hydrogen produced from natural gas and electricity supplies and which stores CO2 in saline reservoirs in Wyoming, the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) ranges from $1.62–2.00/kg H2, and the life cycle emissions range from 3.85–5.74 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. If claimed, the 45Q tax credit decreases the LCOH by 19%. Although the supplies of renewable natural gas feedstock and zero- or low-carbon electricity can lower the carbon footprint to make hydrogen projects qualified for the 45V tax credit, the 45Q tax credit is still a stronger economic incentive. To reduce the supply cost, a hydrogen cluster can be developed in the state by leveraging the colocation and coavailability of multiple natural resources and transport infrastructure. Developing a hydrogen cluster can directly create several thousand construction jobs and several hundred permanent jobs in Wyoming.

Herein, we used zebrafish to uncover the mystery of organ heterogeneous responses to Cu stress and Cu(II)-dependent spine developmental injury in the early organogenesis stage. We first demonstrated that Cu(I) was distributed in the entire body, but high contents of Cu(II) were accumulated in the yolk sac and eye in  normal zebrafish larvae. Cu exposure from birth to 144 hpf caused no obvious damage to Cu-metabolizing organs (liver and intestine), despite the elevated Cu(I) and Cu(II) levels. However, the spine was more sensitive to the Cu exposure. In the spine region, the Cu(I) level remained stable, whereas the level of Cu(II) significantly increased, which was highly associated with spine development injury. A significant negative correlation between Cu(II) and the spine-related parameters was identified. Moreover, cuproptosis caused spine development deformation during the early embryogenesis stage. Spine-related pathways such as somitegenesis significantly changed in the early embryogenesis period, and 5 spine-related pathways were significantly altered in the larval stage at 96 hpf.

Cl2•– represents one of the extensively generated radicals in AOPs, whose behavior in DBP formation remains unknown. In this study, we found that aromatic structures serve as the main DBP precursors in Cl2•– reactions by employing diverse groups of model compounds. At a typical Cl2•– exposure of 1.2 × 10–9 M·s, the sum concentrations of 7 regulated aliphatic DBPs (e.g., trichloromethane, chloroacetic acids) are ∼0.10 to 0.48 μM for aromatic precursors and <0.05 μM for aliphatic ones. The DBP formation mechanisms from Cl2•– reactions involved the formation of chlorinated aromatics, radical-induced oxygen incorporation followed by ring cleavage, and the interactions of Cl2•– with ring-cleavage intermediates. In reacting with DOM, Cl2•– reactions produced much fewer aliphatic DBPs (5% of the total organochlorine vs 40% for chlorination) and chloroacetic acids dominated the aliphatic DBPs (usually trihalomethane for chlorination), which can be well interpreted by the precursors and mechanisms proposed. This work comprehensively reveals the precursors, formation patterns, and mechanisms of DBPs during the less-studied Cl2•– reactions, highlighting the importance of eliminating the aromatic structures of DOM before the AOPs."

Using density functional theory (DFT), we simulated reactions of PFAS with a major atmospheric radical, the hydroxyl radical, revealing activation energies and other thermodynamic insights. The activation energies aid in predicting likely reactions and understanding speciation. Identifying new species can guide future analyses and remediation efforts. We focused on the nine most widely studied families of PFAS, finding that radical abstraction along the alkyl chain is favored over functional groups regardless of chain length.

 Characterizing multipartite quantum systems is crucial for quantum computing and many-body physics. The problem, however, becomes challenging when the system size is large and the properties of interest involve correlations among a large number of particles. Here we introduce a neural network model that can predict various quantum properties of many-body quantum states with constant correlation length, using only measurement data from a small number of neighboring sites. The model is based on the technique of multi-task learning, which we show to offer several advantages over traditional single-task approaches. Through numerical experiments, we show that multi-task learning can be applied to sufficiently regular states to predict global properties, like string order parameters, from the observation of short-range correlations, and to distinguish between quantum phases that cannot be distinguished by single-task networks. Remarkably, our model appears to be able to transfer information learnt from lower dimensional quantum systems to higher dimensional ones, and to make accurate predictions for Hamiltonians that were not seen in the training. Inferring quantum properties of many-body systems is both essential and challenging. Here the authors develop a neural network model that infers these properties from short-range measurements using a quantum-adapted multi-task learning approach."

 River deltas offer numerous ecosystem services and host an estimated global population of 350 million to more than 500 million inhabitants in over 100 countries. To maintain their sustainability into the future, deltas need to withstand sea-level rise from global warming, but human pressures and diminishing sediment supplies are exacerbating their vulnerability. In this Review, we show how deltas have served as environmental incubators for societal development over the past 7,000 years, and how this tightly interlocked relationship now poses challenges to deltas globally. Without climate stabilization, the sustainability of populous low-to-mid-latitude deltas will be difficult to maintain, probably terminating the delta–human relationship that we know today.

 Insights into the impacts of freeze-thaw processes on soil microorganisms and their related functions in permafrost regions are crucial for assessing ecological consequences imposed by the shifts in freeze-thaw patterns. Through in-situ investigations on seasonal freeze-thaw processes in the active layer of permafrost in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we found that microbial richness was higher and positively correlated with soil multifunctionality during the freeze-thaw stage (freezing and thawing periods) compared to the non-freeze-thaw stage (completely frozen and thawed periods). This relationship resulted from the higher microbial stability, which was highly consistent with the lower complexity, more keystone taxa, and greater robustness of networks. Although freeze-thaw strength exacerbated the greenhouse effect on climate, it was alleviated by the enhancement of diversity-soil multifunctionality relationship. These findings have substantial implications for exploring the responses of microbial-mediated soil multifunctionality and greenhouse effect in alpine permafrost to more drastic variations of freeze-thaw processes under future warming.

 The development of adaptive survival strategies is crucial for human occupation of the high-altitude areas of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, the history of this adaptation and its driving mechanisms are poorly understood. We used records of pollen, coprophilous fungal spores, and charcoal from a well-dated, high-resolution lake sediment core from the Southern Tibetan Plateau (STP) to investigate the history of high-altitude survival strategies, including arable agriculture and pastoralism, spanning the past 3600 years. The results revealed that survival strategies were dominated by arable agriculture, supplemented by pastoralism, from ~3600 to 1800 cal yr BP. However, after 1800 cal yr BP, this strategy shifted to low-level arable agriculture with intensified pastoralism. Comparison of our findings with regional paleoclimatic and archaeological records revealed that this transformation was an adaptive response to drought intensification. This adaptive resilience was a key aspect of human occupation of the high-altitude regions of the TP during the late Holocene.

 Climate change has intensified flooding in arid and semi-arid regions, presenting a major challenge for flood monitoring and mapping. While satellites, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), allow synoptically observing flood extents, accurately differentiating between sandy terrains and water for arid region flooding remains an open challenge. Current global flood mapping products exclude arid areas from their analyses due to the sand and water confusion, resulting in a critical lack of observations which impedes response and recovery in these vulnerable regions. This paper explores the full potential of Sentinel-1 SAR to improve near-real-time flood mapping in arid and semi-arid regions. By investigating the impact of various parameters such as polarization, temporal information, and interferometric coherence, the most important information sources for detecting arid floods were identified. Using three distinct arid flood events in Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan, different scenarios were constructed and tested using RF to evaluate the effectiveness of each feature. Permutation feature importance analysis was additionally conducted to identify key elements that reduce computational costs and enable a faster response during emergencies. Fusing VV coherence and amplitude information in pre-flood and post-flood imagery proved to be the most suitable approach. Results also show that leveraging crucial features reduces computational time by ∼35% as well as improves flood mapping accuracy by ∼50%. With advancements in cloud processing capabilities, the computational challenges associated with interferometric SAR computations are no longer a barrier. The demonstrated adaptability of the proposed approach across different arid areas, offers a step forward towards improved global flood mapping."

 Pollutants emitted by catering enterprises pose a significant threat to the environment and public health. In this study, based on a systematic analysis of volatile organic compound (VOC) emission characteristics of different cuisines, the contribution of cooking emissions from catering enterprises to the PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the atmosphere was evaluated using generation potential calculations and WRF-CAMx simulations. The health exposure risks of VOCs in kitchen breathing areas and those of PM2.5 and O3 contributed by the catering enterprises were evaluated. The generation potential calculation results showed that the catering enterprises exhibit 2.21–5.00 gO3/gVOCs of ozone formation potential (OFP) and 0.07–0.21 gSOA/gVOCs of secondary organic aerosol production potential (SOAP). The WRF-CAMx simulation results indicated that cooking emissions from catering enterprises contribute 0.36–1.91 μg/m3 and 0.05–0.21 μg/m3 to PM2.5 and maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) concentrations of O3. The health exposure risks of PM2.5 and O3 were higher in catering enterprises in southern cities than in northern cities and were higher in urban areas than in suburban areas. The average hazardous VOCs (HVOCs) concentrations ranged from 53 ± 16 to 357 ± 31 μg/m3 in kitchen breathing areas. Acrolein was the primary contributor to the hazard index (HI) of all VOC species, accounting for 50.9%–99.5%.

 Based on data diagnosis and numerical experiments, this study investigated the changes in the interannual properties of the May North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and their impact on summer (June–July) sea ice in the North Atlantic during 1979–2021. Results showed statistically significant increase in the interannual variability of the May NAO after the mid-2000s, which had remarkably enhanced impact on summer sea ice in the eastern Hudson Bay (EHB) and the western Labrador Sea (WLS). During 2005–2021, corresponding to a positive phase of the May NAO, anomalous surface westerly or northwesterly winds prevailed over the Hudson Bay and Labrador Sea in May. This led to statistically significant increase in sea ice in both the EHB and the WLS in May via dynamic processes (favoring southeastward movement of the sea ice) and thermal processes (changing surface turbulent heating and shortwave radiation). In comparison with the situation in May, the increase in sea ice in the EHB developed further during summer mainly via thermal processes (positive feedback between the increased sea ice and shortwave radiation). In contrast, amplitude of the increased sea ice in the WLS was comparable between May and summer. Dynamic processes (southeastward movement of sea ice), which was induced by a barotropic anomalous high in the troposphere centered over the Labrador Peninsula, favored the increase in sea ice in summer in the WLS. The tripole sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic and increased snowpack on the Labrador Peninsula in May, triggered by the positive phase of the May NAO, played an important role in the formation of the anomalous high. During 1979–2004, the surface wind, snowpack, and tripole sea surface temperature anomalies in May, triggered by the May NAO, were relatively weak, leading to statistically insignificant changes in summer sea ice in the EHB and WLS."

We generated morphomaps of preimplantation embryogenesis in mouse, rabbit, and monkey embryos, and these morphomaps revealed that although blastomere divisions desynchronized passively, 8-cell embryos converged toward robust three-dimensional shapes. Using topological analysis and genetic perturbations, we found that embryos progressively changed their cellular connectivity to a preferred topology, which could be predicted by a physical model in which actomyosin contractility and noise facilitate topological transitions, lowering surface energy. This mechanism favored regular embryo packing and promoted a higher number of inner cells in the 16-cell embryo. Synchronized division reduced embryo packing and generated substantially more misallocated cells and fewer inner-cell–mass cells.

Ongoing defaunation might compromise effective seed dispersal, but the conservation status of pairwise interactions remains unknown. With a literature review, we reconstructed the first European-wide seed dispersal network and evaluated the conservation status of interactions by assessing each interacting partner’s IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) conservation status and population trends. We found that a third of the disperser species and interactions face potential extinction and that 30% of the plant species have most of their dispersers threatened or declining.

Despite many studies of specific host-pathogen systems, a unifying framework for predicting the outcomes of interactions among pathogens has remained elusive. We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains."

To effectively manage forest resources, timely and accurate annual forest maps at a high spatial resolution are needed. This study improved forest maps by integrating PALSAR-2 and Landsat images. Annual evergreen and non-evergreen forest-type maps were also generated. This critical information supports the Global Forest Resources Assessment. 
 Annual forest maps at a high spatial resolution are necessary for forest management and conservation. Large uncertainties remain in existing forest maps because of different forest definitions, satellite datasets, in situ training datasets, and mapping algorithms. In this study, we generated annual maps of forest and evergreen forest at a 30 m resolution in the contiguous United States (CONUS) during 2015–2017 by integrating microwave data (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar – PALSAR-2) and optical data (Landsat) using knowledge-based algorithms. The resultant PALSAR-2/Landsat-based forest maps (PL-Forest) were compared with five major forest datasets from the CONUS: (1) the Landsat tree canopy cover from the Global Forest Watch dataset (GFW-Forest), (2) the Landsat Vegetation Continuous Field dataset (Landsat VCF-Forest), (3) the National Land Cover Database 2016 (NLCD-Forest), (4) the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency forest maps (JAXA-Forest), and (5) the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FIA-Forest). The forest structure data (tree canopy height and canopy coverage) derived from the lidar observations of the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) on board NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-1) were used to assess the five forest cover datasets derived from satellite images. Using the forest definition of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, more forest pixels from the PL-Forest maps meet the FAO's forest definition than the GFW-Forest, Landsat VCF-Forest, and JAXA-Forest datasets. Forest area estimates from PL-Forest were close to those from the FIA-Forest statistics, higher than GFW-Forest and NLCD-Forest, and lower than Landsat VCF-Forest, which highlights the potential of using both the PL-Forest and FIA-Forest datasets to support the FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment. Furthermore, the PALSAR-2/Landsat-based annual evergreen forest maps (PL-Evergreen Forest) showed reasonable consistency with the NLCD product. The comparison of the most widely used forest datasets offered insights to employ appropriate products for relevant research and management activities across local to regional and national scales. The datasets generated in this study are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21270261 (Wang, 2024).

This dataset demonstrates satisfactory accuracy (F1-score > 0.80) and high consistency with census data. Our dataset provides valuable information for monitoring and mitigating micro-plastic pollution. 
 Plastic film mulching has been extensively used to increase crop yields in arid and semi-arid regions, but it also altered agricultural landscapes and caused severe environmental pollution. Therefore, accurate and timely mapping of plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) distributions is crucial for planning agricultural production and preventing micro-plastic pollution. However, the scarcity of sufficient and representative training samples hinders large-scale supervised classification and extraction of PMF. Additionally, it remains unclear whether a pre-trained classifier can be directly applied to different regions and years for rapid PMF mapping. To address these challenges, we proposed a new framework that simultaneously takes advantages of the automation of index-based method and the generalization ability of supervised classifier-based approach for PMF mapping. Based on the distinctive spectral responses induced by plastic film deployment events, two novel and robust PMF indices—the Max Blue Band-based Plastic-mulched Farmland Index (MBPMFI) and the Blue Band-based Plastic-mulched Farmland Index (BPMFI)—were initially designed to automatically and rapidly extract PMF pixels in cloud-free areas as candidate training samples. Additionally, the transferability of classifiers pre-trained with these automatically generated samples and optimal features was further evaluated in spatial and spatial–temporal transferability scenarios using F1 values. Finally, by coupling the index-based training sample generation method with the temporal classifier transfer approach, PMF distributions were rapidly produced for the Loess Plateau of China (PMF-LP) for 2019–2021. The results showed that the two newly established indices, MBPMFI and BPMFI, were more robust than the existing PMF indices in enhancing PMF information and suppressing complicated backgrounds. The temporal classifier transfer proved suitable for directly and rapidly mapping PMF across multiple years without additional training samples. Using the locally adaptive classifiers as a reference, the average accuracy decrease of the transferred classifiers was less than 7.0 % under the temporal transferability scenario. Our mapping framework achieved F1 values of 0.80–0.86 in recognizing PMF distributions for the Loess Plateau, highlighting its ability to delineate large-scale spatial patterns of PMF. Additionally, the estimated PMF areas based on the PMF-LP aligned well with the agricultural census data at municipal level (R2 > 0.87). The framework developed in this study lays a foundation for future monitoring of PMF distributions and agricultural micro-plastic pollution on a large scale.

Estimating the stability of IAV is challenging and depends on factors such as the respiratory matrix and drying kinetics. Here, we combine kinetic experiments on millimeter-sized saline droplets with a biophysical aerosol model to quantify the impact of NaCl on IAV stability. We show that IAV inactivation is determined by NaCl concentration, which increases during water evaporation and then decreases again when efflorescence occurs. When drying in air with relative humidity RH = 30%, inactivation follows an inverted sigmoidal curve, with inactivation occurring most rapidly when the NaCl concentration exceeds 20 mol/(kg H2O) immediately prior to efflorescence. Efflorescence reduces the NaCl molality to saturated conditions, resulting in a significantly reduced inactivation rate. We demonstrate that the inactivation rate k depends exponentially on NaCl molality, and after the solution reaches equilibrium, the inactivation proceeds at a first-order rate. Introducing sucrose, an organic cosolute, attenuates IAV inactivation via two mechanisms: first by decreasing the NaCl molality during the drying phase and second by a protective effect against the NaCl-induced inactivation.

Frierdich,Fe(II)-Catalyzed Recrystallization Drives Phosphorus and Aluminum Release from Goethite,"Goethite often harbors impurities, such as phosphorus (P) and aluminum (Al), which are incorporated into its structure through direct substitution or coprecipitation with nanocrystalline phases. Understanding the processes that drive the release of P and Al from goethite is of paramount importance for the iron ore industry and for managing nutrient and pollutant behavior in the environment. This study investigates the impact of Fe(II)-catalyzed recrystallization on the release of P and Al from goethite. We evaluated the solubility and extractability of P and Al in suspensions of Al- and P-coprecipitated goethite, treated with 57Fe-enriched Fe(II)aq under oxygen-free conditions for 30 days at neutral pH and room temperatures. The addition of Fe(II)aq induced the recrystallization of goethite dominant initial synthetic phases (i.e., low P- and Al-containing phases) and the transformation of higher P- and/or Al-bearing starting material that was actually a mixture of goethite and minor amounts of lepidocrocite and feroxyhyte. Our results reveal that Fe(II)-catalyzed mineral and structural evolution led to the repartitioning of P and, to a lesser extent, Al throughout the crystal structure, mineral surface, and aqueous solution. Following a 30 day reaction with Fe(II)aq, we extracted approximately 80, 68.8, 73.9, and 83.2% of P from P-only, low, medium, and high P + Al goethite, respectively. Additionally, we observed total Al removals of approximately 17, 27, and 25% from low, medium, and high P + Al goethite, respectively. The results demonstrate that treating both P-only and P + Al goethite with Fe(II) at room temperature, followed by a 24 h extraction using 1 M NaOH, significantly enhances the overall extractability of P and Al, including both aqueous and surface-adsorbed fractions, compared to Fe(II)-free controls. These findings advance our understanding of the recrystallization process and impurity substitution in goethite, offering promising avenues for developing new environmentally friendly methods to extract P and other impurities from goethitic iron ores at lower temperatures."

Yet mechanistic linkages between root exudation and emergent biogeochemical processes remain challenging to measure nondestructively, in real soil, over time. Here we used a novel combination of in situ microsensors with high-resolution mass spectrometry to measure, nondestructively, changing exudation and associated biogeochemical dynamics along single growing plant roots (Avena sativa). We found that metabolite and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations as well as microbial growth, redox potential (EH), and pH dynamics vary significantly among bulk soil, root tip, and more mature root zones. Surprisingly, the significant spike of rhizosphere DOC upon root tip emergence did not significantly correlate with any biogeochemical parameters. However, the presence of sugars significantly correlated with declines in EH following the arrival of the root tip, likely due to enhanced microbial oxygen demand. Similarly, the presence of organic acids significantly correlated to declines in pH upon root tip emergence. Overall, our in situ measurements highlight how different exudates released along growing roots create functionally distinct soil microenvironments that evolve over time."

This study combines land use classification, P-flow modeling, spatial analysis, and cause-effect chain modeling to assess P emissions and P-induced FEP at a fine spatial resolution in Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area and reveals their dynamic responses to land use changes. We find that land conversion from cultivated land to impervious land corresponded to an increase in P emissions of 4.1, 1.8, and 0.5 Gg during 2000–2005, 2005–2010, and 2010–2015 periods, respectively, revealing its dominant but weakening role in the intensification of P emissions especially in less-developed cities. Expansion of aquacultural land gradually became the primary contributor to the increase in both the amount and intensity of P emissions. Land conversions from cultivated land to impervious land and from natural water bodies to aquacultural land led to 35.9% and 25.3% of the increase in FEP, respectively.

However, the high-energy ultraviolet (UV) photons in the solar spectrum can cause severe photocorrosion of semiconductors and irreversible photodamage to microorganisms within BNH. Here, we developed an encapsulation strategy using natural luminogens with aggregation-induced emission characteristics (AIEgens) to construct a protective layer for BNH, effectively shielding them against high-energy UV photons. We incorporated natural berberine (BBR) into the BNH composed of Methanosarcina barkeri and polymeric carbon nitrides (CNx). The self-assembled BNH–BBR system displayed a 2.75-fold higher CH4 yield than BNH under simulated solar irradiation. Mechanism analysis revealed that BBR acted as a UV sunscreen for BNH by converting high-energy short wavelengths into low-energy long wavelengths, thereby reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and alleviating the photocorrosion of CNx. Furthermore, BBR functioned as a photosynergist for BNH by regulating photoelectron production and utilization, enhancing the intracellular energy formation in M. barkeri for growth and metabolism. This work provides important insights into the effective and scalable conversion of CO2 into valuable biofuels with BNH under light illumination containing high-energy photons."

However, the universality and evolutionary processes of their generation, particularly concerning their secondary sources, remain unclear at present. We demonstrated through laboratory flow tube experiments that corresponding nitrosamines were generated from heterogeneous reactions of nitrous acid (HONO) with five structurally diverse amines commonly found indoors, including diphenylamine (DPhA), dibenzylamine (DBzA), dioctylamine (DOtA), N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), and N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (PANA). The heterogeneous reaction rate constants of DBzA and DOtA with HONO (∼70 ppb) were 1.21 × 10–3 and 2.13 × 10–3 min–1 at 30% relative humidity (RH), resulting in a lifetime of 13.8 and 7.8 h. As compared to higher RH (∼80%), more nitrosamines were produced from the reaction of HONO with surface-sorbed DBzA, DOtA, 6PPD, and PANA at lower RH (30%), with product yields ranging from <0.1% to 0.5%. Furthermore, we observed the formation of nitroso-6PPDs and nitro-6PPDs during room air exposure of 6PPD in a genuine indoor environment, in addition to various other transformation products indicative of reactions of 6PPD with HONO, NOx, and ozone indoors.

The ecological remediation of abandoned tailings is a topic of broad interest, yet our understanding of microbial metabolic status in restored soils, particularly at the aggregate scale, remains limited. This study investigated microbial resources within soil aggregates from revegetated tailings and applied a vector model of ecoenzymatic stoichiometry to examine how different vegetation patterns (grassland, forest, or bare land control) impact microbial resource limitation. Five-year vegetation restoration significantly elevated carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and their stoichiometric ratios in soil aggregates (approximately 2-fold), although these increases were not translated to in the microbial biomass and its stoichiometry. The activities of C- and phosphorus (P)-acquiring extracellular enzymes in these aggregates increased substantially postvegetation, with the most pronounced escalation in macroaggregates (>0.25 mm). The vector model results indicated soil microbial metabolism was colimited by C and P, most acutely in microaggregates (<0.25 mm). This colimitation was exacerbated by monotypic vegetation cover but mitigated under diversified vegetation cover. Soil nutrient stoichiometric ratios in vegetation restoration controlled microbial resource limitation, overshadowing the impact of heavy metals. Our findings underscore that optimizing resource allocation within soil aggregates through strategic revegetation can enhance microbial metabolism in tailings, which advocates for the implementation of diverse vegetation covers as a viable strategy to improve the ecological development of degraded landscapes."

Herein, novel three-dimensional printed Fe0 (3DP-Fe0) and bimetallic 3DP-Ni/Fe0 were customized by 3D printing for efficient Fenton-like degradation of florfenicol (FLO), a typical antibiotic in wastewater. 3DP-Ni/Fe0 with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exhibited superior reactivity toward FLO than 3DP-Fe0, generating hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and atomic hydrogen to achieve >90% dehalogenation and >70% total organic carbon removal within 10 min. The resulting degradation intermediates possessed lower antibacterial activity than FLO and did not cause resistance gene proliferation in activated sludge. The Fenton-like activity of 3DP-Ni/Fe0 was similar across different shapes but increased with increasing porosity and size. Compared with powdered Ni/Fe0, 3DP-Ni/Fe0 exhibited faster electron transfer during Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycling, which increased the utilization efficiency of dissolved Fe2+ and H2O2 for ·OH production. Moreover, 3DP-Ni/Fe0 could be reused >150 times, 5-fold more than powdered Ni/Fe0, owing to its lower metal ion release and Fe0 depletion. 3DP-Ni/Fe0 with H2O2 can also efficiently remove chemical oxygen demand from real wastewater and other ROPs (e.g., acetaminophen, carbamazepine, thiamphenicol, and tetrabromobisphenol A)."

In this study, fluorescent polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) were found in the thymus, spleen, testes, liver, kidneys, and brain on day 1 or day 3 after one intratracheal instillation. Furthermore, mice showed inflammation in multiple organs, manifested as obvious infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, increased Toll-like receptors (TLRs), myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), as well as proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β) in the lungs, thymus, spleen, liver, and kidneys after four intratracheal instillations of PS-MPs at once every 2 weeks. Hepatic and renal function indexes were also increased. Subsequently, the inflammatory response in multiple murine organs was significantly alleviated by TLR2 and TLR4 inhibitors. Unexpectedly, we did not find any elevated secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 or  TNF-α by RAW264.7 macrophages in vitro. Thus, PS-MPs induced inflammatory injuries in multiple murine organs via the TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in vivo, but not macrophages in vitro.

As a result, there is a steady increase in the evidence linking greenspaces and COVID‐19 impact. However, the evidence of the benefits of greenspaces or greenness to human wellbeing in the context of COVID‐19 is fragmented and sometimes contradictory. This calls for a meta‐analysis of existing studies to clarify the matter. Here, we identified 621 studies across the world on the matter, which were then filtered down to 13 relevant studies for meta‐analysis, covering Africa, Asia, Europe, and the USA. These studies were meta‐analyzed, with the impacts of greenness on COVID‐19 infection rate quantified using regression estimates whereas impacts on mortality rates were measured using mortality rate ratios. We found evidence of significant negative correlations between greenness and both COVID‐19 infection and mortality rates. We further found that the impacts on COVID‐19 infection and related mortality are moderated by year of publication, greenness metrics, sample size, health and political covariates.

 Mesoscale oceanic eddies contribute to the redistribution of resources needed for plankton to thrive. However, due to their fluid-trapping capacity, they can also isolate plankton communities, subjecting them to rapidly changing environmental conditions. Diazotrophs, which fix dinitrogen (N2), are key members of the plankton community, providing reactive nitrogen, particularly in large nutrient-depleted regions such as subtropical gyres. However, there is still limited knowledge about how mesoscale structures characterized by specific local environmental conditions can affect the distribution and metabolic response of diazotrophs when compared with the large-scale dynamics of an oceanic region. Here we investigated genetic diazotroph diversity and N2 fixation rates in a transect across the Gulf Stream and two associated eddies, a region with intense mesoscale activity known for its important role in nutrient transport into the North Atlantic Gyre. We show that eddy edges are hotspots for diazotroph activity with potential community connectivity between eddies. Using a long-term mesoscale eddy database, we quantified N2 fixation rates as up to 17 times higher within eddies than in ambient waters, overall providing ~21 µmol N m−2 yr−1 to the region. Our results indicate that mesoscale eddies are hotspots of reactive nitrogen production within the broader marine nitrogen cycle.

Here, the authors reveal a critical role for matrix viscosity in controlling this crosstalk, which they explain via a modified molecular clutch model. 
 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) interact with their surroundings via integrins, which link to the actin cytoskeleton and translate physical cues into biochemical signals through mechanotransduction. N-cadherins enable cell-cell communication and are also linked to the cytoskeleton. This crosstalk between integrins and cadherins modulates MSC mechanotransduction and fate. Here we show the role of this crosstalk in the mechanosensing of viscosity using supported lipid bilayers as substrates of varying viscosity. We functionalize these lipid bilayers with adhesion peptides for integrins (RGD) and N-cadherins (HAVDI), to demonstrate that integrins and cadherins compete for the actin cytoskeleton, leading to an altered MSC mechanosensing response. This response is characterised by a weaker integrin adhesion to the environment when cadherin ligation occurs. We model this competition via a modified molecular clutch model, which drives the integrin/cadherin crosstalk in response to surface viscosity, ultimately controlling MSC lineage commitment.

 Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, also known as two-component Schrödinger cats, play vital roles in the foundation of quantum physics and the potential quantum applications. Enlargement in size and coherent control of GHZ states are both crucial for harnessing entanglement in advanced computational tasks with practical advantages, which unfortunately pose tremendous challenges as GHZ states are vulnerable to noise. Here we propose a general strategy for creating, preserving, and manipulating large-scale GHZ entanglement, and demonstrate a series of experiments underlined by high-fidelity digital quantum circuits. For initialization, we employ a scalable protocol to create genuinely entangled GHZ states with up to 60 qubits, almost doubling the previous size record. For protection, we take a different perspective on discrete time crystals (DTCs), originally for exploring exotic nonequilibrium quantum matters, and embed a GHZ state into the eigenstates of a tailor-made cat scar DTC to extend its lifetime. For manipulation, we switch the DTC eigenstates with in-situ quantum gates to modify the effectiveness of the GHZ protection. Our findings establish a viable path towards coherent operations on large-scale entanglement, and further highlight superconducting processors as a promising platform to explore nonequilibrium quantum matters and emerging applications.

Here, Saha et al. show that cone photoreceptors in the fovea exhibit weaker and slower light adaptation than cones in the peripheral retina due to differences in ion-channel properties. 
 Adaptation in cone photoreceptors allows our visual system to effectively operate over an enormous range of light intensities. However, little is known about the properties of cone adaptation in the specialized region of the primate central retina called the fovea, which is densely packed with cones and mediates high-acuity central vision. Here we show that macaque foveal cones exhibit weaker and slower luminance adaptation compared to cones in the peripheral retina. We find that this difference in adaptive properties between foveal and peripheral cones is due to differences in the magnitude of a hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih. This Ih current regulates the strength and time course of luminance adaptation in peripheral cones where it is more prominent than in foveal cones. A weaker and slower adaptation in foveal cones helps maintain a higher sensitivity for a longer duration which may be well-suited for maximizing the collection of high-acuity information at the fovea during gaze fixation between rapid eye movements. Light adaptation in the primate fovea is poorly understood. Here, Saha et al. show that cone photoreceptors in the fovea exhibit weaker and slower light adaptation than cones in the peripheral retina due to differences in ion-channel properties."

 Recent research has identified multiple immune systems that bacteria use to protect themselves from viral infections. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which these systems horizontally spread, especially among bacterial pathogens. Here, we investigate antiviral defenses in staphylococci, opportunistic pathogens that constitute leading causes of antibiotic-resistant infections. We show that these organisms harbor a variety of anti-phage defenses encoded within or near SCC (staphylococcal cassette chromosome) mec cassettes, mobile genomic islands that confer methicillin resistance. Importantly, we demonstrate that SCCmec-encoded recombinases mobilize not only SCCmec, but also tandem SCC-like cassettes enriched in genes coding for diverse defense systems. Further, we show that phage infection stimulates cassette mobilization (i.e. excision and circularization). Thus, our findings indicate that SCC/SCCmec cassettes not only spread antibiotic resistance but can also play a role in mobilizing anti-phage defenses.

This study elucidates the mechanisms within the sea cucumber digestive system and their symbiotic microbiome which enable them to efficiently utilize nutrients from seabed sediments. 
 Sea cucumbers are predominant deposit feeders in benthic ecosystems, providing protective benefits to coral reefs by reducing disease prevalence. However, how they receive sufficient nutrition from seabed sediments remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate Holothuria leucospilota, an ecologically significant tropical sea cucumber, to elucidate digestive mechanisms underlying marine deposit-feeding. Genomic analysis reveals intriguing evolutionary adaptation characterized by an expansion of digestive carbohydrase genes and a contraction of digestive protease genes, suggesting specialization in digesting microalgae. Developmentally, two pivotal dietary shifts, namely, from endogenous nutrition to planktonic feeding, and from planktonic feeding to deposit feeding, induce changes in digestive tract enzyme profiles, with adults mainly expressing carbohydrases and lipases. A nuanced symbiotic relationship exists between gut microbiota and the host, namely, specific resident bacteria supply crucial enzymes for food digestion, while other bacteria are digested and provide assimilable nutrients. Our study further identifies Holothuroidea lineage-specific lysozymes that are restrictedly expressed in the intestines to support bacterial digestion. Overall, this work advances our knowledge of the evolutionary innovations in the sea cucumber digestive system which enable them to efficiently utilize nutrients from seabed sediments and promote food recycling within marine ecosystems.

 Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, is associated with congenital neurological complications. Here, we investigate potential pathological correlates of virus gene expression in representative ZIKV strains through RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling. In addition to the single long polyprotein found in all flaviviruses, we identify the translation of unrecognised upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the genomic 5′ region. In Asian/American strains, ribosomes translate uORF1 and uORF2, whereas in African strains, the two uORFs are fused into one (African uORF). We use reverse genetics to examine the impact on ZIKV fitness of different uORFs mutant viruses. We find that expression of the African uORF and the Asian/American uORF1 modulates virus growth and tropism in human cortical neurons and cerebral organoids, suggesting a potential role in neurotropism. Although the uORFs are expressed in mosquito cells, we do not see a measurable effect on transmission by the mosquito vector in vivo. The discovery of ZIKV uORFs sheds new light on the infection of the human brain cells by this virus and raises the question of their existence in other neurotropic flaviviruses.

The transgenic mouse model here presented accumulates neuromelanin and mimics the early physiopathology of Parkinson’s disease. 
 One key limitation in developing effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of models accurately mimicking the complex physiopathology of the human disease. Humans accumulate with age the pigment neuromelanin inside neurons that synthesize catecholamines. Neurons reaching the highest neuromelanin levels preferentially degenerate in Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and apparently healthy aging individuals. However, this brain pigment is not taken into consideration in current animal models because common laboratory species, such as rodents, do not produce neuromelanin. Here we generate a tissue-specific transgenic mouse, termed tgNM, that mimics the human age-dependent brain-wide distribution of neuromelanin within catecholaminergic regions, based on the constitutive catecholamine-specific expression of human melanin-producing enzyme tyrosinase. We show that, in parallel to progressive human-like neuromelanin pigmentation, these animals display age-related neuronal dysfunction and degeneration affecting numerous brain circuits and body tissues, linked to motor and non-motor deficits, reminiscent of early neurodegenerative stages. This model could help explore new research avenues in brain aging and neurodegeneration. Unlike humans, rodents do not accumulate the brain pigment neuromelanin in catecholamine neurons with age.

 The gradual adjustment of fertility and retirement policies in China has social benefits in terms of coping with population aging. However, the environmental consequences of these policies remain ambiguous. Here we compile environmentally extended multiregional input–output tables to estimate household carbon footprints for different population age groups in China. Subsequently, we estimate the age-sex-specific population under different fertility policies up to 2060 and assess the impacts of fertility and retirement policies on household carbon footprints. We find that Chinese young people have relatively higher household carbon footprints than their older counterparts due to differences in income by age group. Relaxing fertility policies and delaying retirement age are associated with an increase in population (and labour supply) and thus increases in household carbon footprints, with the majority of these increases from the fertility side. These results may help policymakers understand interactions among those measures targeting population aging and climate action.

 Breeding programmes have increased the yields of major crops, including maize (Zea mays L.), but the suitability of optimized traits to future climates remains unclear. Here, by comparing the responses of 323 elite maize inbred lines from different breeding eras under natural field conditions, we show that while newer lines exhibit higher grain yield than the early released lines under standard growth, the bred trait of reduced tassel size increases the susceptibility of newly released lines to high temperature during flowering. We identified a potential threshold for spikelets per tassel (~700), over which maize can produce a stably high seed set ratio under warm conditions, and show that small-tassel (<700 spikelets per tassel) genotypes are now unsuitable in 23.7% of global maize-growing regions.

 Remote astronomical telescopes without access to the national electricity grid are usually designed to rely on fossil fuels without considering the social and energy needs of the surrounding communities. Concurrently, climate change concerns and fuel price vulnerability are driving the transition to renewable energy sources. Here we propose a socially accepted renewable energy system for a future telescope in the Atacama Desert, combining an energy system model with a participatory multi-criteria analysis. Our findings highlight the fact that various stakeholders, including local residents, the municipality, the existing local utility and observatories, prioritize emissions reduction, security of supply and reduced electricity costs. The results reveal that a system supplying renewable energy to the telescope could also cover 66% of a nearby community’s energy needs without additional capacity. Stakeholder inputs show that this is the most attractive solution by developing an energy system in which all the actors benefit. Replicating similar energy systems at nearby telescopes could reduce fossil fuel-based energy generation by 30 GWh annually, cutting emissions by 18–24 ktCO2e while contributing to energy justice.

 Nations worldwide are implementing greenhouse gas mitigation measures and promoting the efficient use of natural resources to reduce human pressure on the environment and to increase sustainability. Most of these efforts focus on technological advancement and emphasize the need for economic growth, which will enable further development. However, the impact of demographic trends on sustainability and potential response measures has so far received little attention. Here we develop a model to explore a nation’s potential for environmental footprint mitigation over time given existing and expected demographic trends, consumption patterns and technological advancements. The model is used to test the effects of different scenarios (combinations of mitigation factors) on Israel’s land, water and carbon footprints by 2050 as a case study. The analysis reveals that even when implementing an advanced scenario that combines major technological and behavioural changes, the nation’s mitigation goals will not be achieved given the current demographic trend. Our findings emphasize the need for models that test the effects of combinations of factors on natural resources and the environment.

 Recent large-scale seismological observations have shown that off-fault strain localization and foreshock migration could serve as an early warning of an impending earthquake. However, this process is still largely unknown. In this study, state-of-the-art friction experiments were conducted in a oil-confined biaxial shear apparatus to investigate the link between stick-slip nucleation and off-fault deformation. Our findings indicate that there is a direct link between stick-slip nucleation and off-fault deformation, provided that the fault is conditionally unstable (a − b < 0). Inelastic off-fault deformation may trigger unstable slip by decreasing the stiffness of the surrounding rock volume, which favors earthquake nucleation. Additionally, the study presents laboratory observation of precursory strain localization around a fault during stick-slip cycles.

 Marine sediments are archives of environmental change with pollutants potentially acting as chronographic markers of the Anthropocene. Particularly, the vertical transport and burial, as well as slow degradation rate of microplastics, indicate an eventual incorporation into the geological record. A high-resolution reconstruction of microplastics records requires high sedimentation rates, and in Disko Bay (Greenland), this quality coincides with a need for plastic pollution data. Here, a Greenlandic sediment core dated back to 1930 ± 2 was reconstructed for microplastics accumulation via micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We show 85 years of fluctuating microplastics accumulation (987 − 16,645 particles Kg−1) down to 20 µm and diversified into eight polymers. Polyethylene (47%) and polypropylene (32%) were more abundantly present through time. Microplastics accumulation increases significantly after 1950 along with major socio-economic development in the area, suggesting an influence from regional stressors. Regional microplastics reconstructions must therefore be considered in the pursuit of an Anthropocene global plastic horizon. The deposition of microplastics in the sediments of Disko Bay, West Greenland increased markedly after 1950 alongside increased regional socio-economic development as suggested by analyzes of a Greenlandic sediment core."

 Climatic change threatens the persistence of atoll islands and the cultural and ecosystem services they support. However, adaptation and ecosystem management are constrained by lack of knowledge of island-specific transformations. We present an empirically-based island change framework that characterises the physical trajectory of islands, based on high-resolution shoreline analysis on 509 atoll islands in the central Pacific over the past half-century. Using changes in island size and position we identify seven distinct styles of island transformation in the Pacific, including contraction (21.4%), stability (46.1%) and expansion (32.4%), and show that 40% of islands are currently mobile on reef surfaces. Results challenge the framing of islands as erosional, which misrepresents island behaviour and constrains understanding of island futures. The island change framework highlights a broader set of island-specific management considerations, and opportunities, that scale with the style and rate of island change, and provides an empirical basis to inform management.

 Drought is one of the most damaging hydroclimatic hazards, impacting environmental systems and socioeconomic sectors. Therefore, understanding the physical mechanisms that cause drought events is of critical importance. Here we investigate the influence of oceanic and continental moisture deficits on global meteorological drought events in recent decades, utilizing a Lagrangian dispersion model to track the origin of precipitation deficits leading to droughts. Additionally, meteorological drought events between 1980 and 2018 were segmented based on a three-dimension algorithm considering spatial extent, duration, and magnitude of drought events. Severe meteorological drought events exhibit mixed contribution of precipitation deficits from both continental and oceanic sources. This highlights the importance of considering both types of deficits in understanding severe meteorological droughts. Comparative analysis across time periods shows a consistent pattern in the dominant mixed contribution of precipitation deficits. There is no relevant decadal change in the mixed contributions of these deficits, which implies stability in the prevalence of oceanic and continental sources driving extreme drought events. These findings offer valuable insights into the factors shaping meteorological drought evolution.

 Mangroves in tropical and subtropical coasts are subject to episodic disturbances, notably from severe storms, leading to potential widespread vegetation mortality. The ability of vegetation to recover varies, and with disturbances becoming more frequent and severe, it is vital to track and project vegetation responses to support management and policy decisions. Prior studies have largely focused on binary mangrove mapping (i.e., presence or absence), while tracking conditions and condition change have not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we demonstrate a method based on dense time series Landsat images for continuous monitoring of mangrove conditions, where we track three kinds of post-disturbance mangrove conditions, including disturbed (disturbed, with rebound to the previous state within one growing season), recovering (undergoing natural recovery in longer than one growing season), and declining (showing long-term decline after disturbance). The method starts with disturbance detection using the DEtection and Characterization Of the tiDal wEtland change (DECODE) algorithm, an existing dense time series model designed to detect disturbances in tidal wetlands with adaptation to tidal fluctuations. This algorithm is well suited for the detection of tidal wetland disturbances but does not provide satisfactory post-disturbance monitoring results, due to the substantial variability in post-disturbance Landsat observations. To better monitor post-disturbance conditions, a new time series fitting approach, DECODER (DECODE and Recovery), is proposed for the recovery stage. Additionally, for temporal segments divided by disturbance events, we built a random forest classifier with temporal-spectral variables derived from the time series model to characterize mangrove conditions. Employing this approach in Florida's mangroves, we generated condition maps, such as dieback and recovery, with an overall accuracy of approximately 97.96 ± 0.86- [95 % confidence intervals]. Comparing post-hurricane conditions in Florida revealed that the increased frequency and severity of disturbances are challenging mangrove resilience, potentially diminishing their ability to recover and sustain ecosystem functions."

 Lake bathymetry is important for quantifying and characterizing underwater morphology and its geophysical state, which is critical for hydrological and ecological studies. Due primarily to the harsh environment of the Tibetan Plateau, there is a severe lack of lake bathymetry measurements, limiting the accurate estimation of total lake volumes and their evolutions. Here, we propose a novel lake bathymetry reconstruction by combining ICESat-2/ATLAS (Advanced Topography Laser Altimetry System) data with a numerical model. An improved grid-based photon noise removal method is used to address the photon signal buried in the background noise during the local daytime. The developed model was validated for seven lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and showed good agreement between simulated and measured lake volumes, with an average absolute percentage error of 8.0 % for maximum water depth and 19.7 % for lake volume simulations. The model was then utilized to estimate the water volume of other lakes by combining it with the self-affine theory. The lake depths obtained from ICESat-2/ATLAS show good agreement (RMSE = 0.69 m; rRMSE = 10.3 %) with available in-situ measurements for lakes with depths <16.5 m, demonstrating the potential of ICESat-2/ATLAS for improved reconstruction of the bathymetry of clear water inland lakes. Our study reveals for the first time, that the Tibetan Plateau has an estimated total lake water volume of 1043.69 ± 341.31 km3 for 33,477 lakes (>0.01 km2) in 2022. Over 70 % (∼734.8 km3) of the lake water storage is concentrated in the Inner Plateau, with the Yellow River basin accounting for 10.9 % (∼113.9 km3), followed by the Indus River basin with 7.2 % (∼75.1 km3). Our study provides a robust method for estimating total lake volumes where in-situ measurements are scarce and can be extended to other clear water lakes, thus contributing to more accurate global assessments and towards comprehensive quantification of Earth's surface water resources distribution."

 Avian diversity, a key indicator of ecosystem health, is closely related to canopy structure. Most avian diversity models are based on either optical remote sensing or airborne lidar data, but the latter is limited to small study areas. The launch of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument in 2018 has opened new avenues for exploring the influence of vegetation structure on avian diversity. To examine how direct measurements of canopy structural characteristics explain bird diversity across North America, we analyzed 18 GEDI metrics from 2019 to 2022, along with corresponding Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) counts and AVONET morphological data, analyzing effects across broad regions and at varying spatial extents. We grouped 440 bird species into 20 ecological guilds under six guild categories and employed random forest algorithms to model avian diversity across eight spatial extents (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, and 39.2 km). The models predicted six diversity indices, including species richness (sRich), functional richness (fRich), evenness (fEve), dispersion (fDis), divergence (fDiv), and redundancy (fRed) across eight spatial extents. The best-predicted guilds varied for each diversity index. The most accurate models were sRich (pseudo-R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 4.28) and fRed (pseudo-R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 0.13) for forest specialists guilds; fRich (pseudo-R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 0.18) for urban guilds; fEve (pseudo-R2 = 0.28, RMSE = 0.08) for insectivore guilds; and fDiv (pseudo-R2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.12) and fDis (pseudo-R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.87) for short distance migrants guilds. Our results highlight the critical role of canopy structure, including its horizontal and vertical distribution and variation, in predicting avian diversity, as measured by the mean number of detected modes (num_detectedmodes), the standard deviation of foliage height diversity (FHD), num_detectedmodes, canopy cover, and plant area index (PAI) across the spatial extents centered on BBS routes. Therefore, we recommend incorporating the GEDI metrics into avian diversity modeling and mapping across North America, thereby potentially enhancing bird habitat management and conservation efforts."

 Information on rice planting areas is critically important for food and water security, as well as for adapting to climate change. Mapping rice globally remains challenging due to the diverse climatic conditions and various rice cropping systems worldwide. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which is immune to climatic conditions, plays a vital role in rice mapping in cloudy, rainy, low-latitude regions but it suffers from commission errors in high-latitude regions. Conversely, optical data performs well in high-latitude regions due to its high observation frequency and less cloud contamination but faces significant omission errors in low-latitude regions. An effective integrated method that combines both data types is key to global rice mapping. Here, we propose a novel adaptive rice mapping framework named Rice-Sentinel that combines Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. First, we extracted key phenological phases of rice (e.g., the flooding and transplanting phase and the rapid growth phase), by analyzing the characteristic V-shaped changes in the Sentinel-1 VH curve. Second, we identified potential flooding signals in rice pixels by integrating the VH time series from Sentinel-1 with the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Sentinel-2, utilizing the generated phenology phases. Third, the rapid growth signals of rice following its flooding phase were identified using Sentinel-2 data. Finally, rice fields were identified by integrating flooding and rapid growth signals. The resultant rice maps in six different case regions of the world (Northeast and South China, California, USA, Mekong Delta of Vietnam, Sakata City in Japan, and Mali in Africa) showed overall accuracies over 90 % and F1 scores over 0.91, outperforming the existing methods and products. This algorithm combines the strengths of both optical and SAR time series data and leverages biophysical principles to generate robust rice maps without relying on any prior ground truth samples. It is well-positioned for global applications and is expected to contribute to global rice monitoring efforts."

 Understanding and forecasting the spatial and temporal distributions of extreme precipitation over urban areas is crucial for effective planning and mitigation efforts. However, this task remains challenging as accurate forecasting depends on properly representing urban surfacees and their interactions with the planetary boundary layer (PBL). We examined the hindcast of an extreme precipitation event over Beijing on 21–22 July 2012. The primary focus was assessing its sensitivity to two widely used PBL parameterizations (MYJ and YSU), two urban parameterizations (SLUCM and BEP_BEM), and two different land-use and land-cover (LULC) datasets.Sensitivity experiments were initialized at different times to explore the model dependence on initial conditions. The analyses were conducted over three selected regions: the entire model domain covering the Beijing metropolitan area, an upwind region of Beijing, and the entire urban area of Beijing. The results show that the MYJ PBL scheme performs better than the YSU PBL scheme in capturing near-surface air temperature as well as the location and timing of the heaviest precipitation. The variability in simulated precipitation among the chosen PBL schemes is lower compared to that among different time of initializations. The LULC impacted the spatial distribution of precipitation but its effect on the amount of precipitation was minimal. Overall, using a combination of the MYJ PBL scheme, SLUCM urban parameterization, and locally-enhanced Beijing LULC, and initializing the model simulations at 0000 UTC July 20, 2012, demonstrated superior performance in capturing precipitation levels, despite some spatial discrepancies in the precipitation distribution. The performance of BEP_BEM urban parameterization is similar to SLUCM across various factors such as average rain rate, maximum rain rate, and rain volume. These findings offer valuable insights towards better simulations of extreme precipitation and flooding in rapidly urbanizing areas such as Beijing."

However, it is virtually unknown how multiple biotic and abiotic drivers, such as climate, grazing, and fire, interact to determine woody dominance across global drylands. We conducted a standardized field survey in 304 plots across 25 countries to assess how climatic features, soil properties, grazing, and fire affect woody dominance in dryland rangelands. Precipitation, temperature, and grazing were key determinants of tree and shrub dominance. The effects of grazing were determined not solely by grazing pressure but also by the dominant livestock species. Interactions between soil, climate, and grazing and differences in responses to these factors between trees and shrubs were key to understanding changes in woody dominance. Our findings suggest that projected changes in climate and grazing pressure may increase woody dominance in drylands, altering their structure and functioning."

Recent studies showed that meteorites display unique mass-independent isotopic signatures of the volatile element Zn, suggesting that Earth’s Zn originated from materials derived from different regions of the Solar System. However, these studies largely omitted meteorites from the differentiated planetesimals thought to represent the Earth’s building blocks, which underwent melting and substantial volatile loss. Here, we characterize the mass-independent Zn isotope compositions of meteorites from such planetesimals. We incorporate these results in mixing models that aim to reproduce Earth’s abundance and isotope compositions of Zn and other elements. Our results suggest that, while differentiated planetesimals supplied ~70% of Earth’s mass, they provided only ~10% of its Zn. The remaining Zn was supplied by primitive materials that did not experience melting and associated volatile loss. Combined with other findings, our results imply that an unmelted primitive material is likely required to establish the volatile budgets of the terrestrial planets."

Climate models forced by historical anthropogenic forcing suggest an increase in AR activity in the extratropics over the past four decades. However, reanalyses indicate a ~6° to 10° poleward shift of ARs during boreal winter in both hemispheres, featuring a rise along 50°N and 50°S and a decrease along 30°N and 30°S. Our analysis demonstrates that low-frequency sea surface temperature variability in the tropical eastern Pacific exhibits a cooling tendency since 2000 that plays a key role in driving this global AR shift, mostly over extratropical oceans, through a tropical-driven eddy-mean flow feedback. This mechanism also operates on interannual timescales, controlled by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and is less pronounced over the Southern Ocean due to weaker eddy activity during austral summer. These highlight the sensitivity of ARs to large-scale circulation changes driven by both internal variability and external forcing in current and upcoming decades."

On cooling below the Néel temperatures, a sharp field–induced transition in magnetization is observed for CaCoGe2O6, while multiple magnetization plateaus beneath the full saturation moment are spotted for CaCoSi2O6. Our analysis shows that these contrasting behaviors potentially arise from the different electron configurations of germanium and silicon, in which the 3d orbitals are filled in the former but empty in the latter, enabling electron hopping.

Results highlight some advantages (e.g., large time steps) and disadvantages (e.g., weak vertical fluxes near the surface) of this approach. 
 A new computational fluid dynamics code for Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of the atmospheric boundary layer and convection is presented and made available. A key novelty is that moist thermodynamics is formulated in terms of thermodynamic potentials, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Despite the apparent complexity of the thermodynamic potential approach, the model's performance demonstrates that it is feasible and effective at reasonable computational cost for three-dimensional simulations. Semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian numerical methods are used; such methods are unusual for simulating boundary layer and convective flows and are more typical of global atmospheric models. Moreover, the model includes no explicit scheme to represent subgrid-scale fluxes of scalars and momentum but relies instead on the mixing and dissipation resulting from the numerical methods used; in other words, it employs Implicit LES (ILES). Sample results from several standard LES test cases show that the model's ability to capture the main aspects of the flows is comparable to other LES models. At the same time, the results highlight limitations of the ILES approach near the bottom boundary and suggest that ILES might need to be augmented in some way, for example, by distributing the convergence of surface fluxes over several model layers. Also, results for a marine stratocumulus case show a significant sensitivity to different options for the numerical methods and parameters used. Further development and application of the code would benefit from a deeper understanding of both the bottom boundary behaviour and the sensitivities to numerics."

Consequently, alternative “replacement” PFASs have been introduced and are prevalent in environmental matrices. Few studies have investigated the molecular effects of both legacy and replacement PFASs under short-term exposures. This study aimed to address this by utilizing transcriptomic sequencing to compare the molecular impacts of exposure to concentrations 0.001–5 mg/L of the legacy PFOS and two of its replacements, PFECHS and FBSA. Using zebrafish embryos, the research assessed apical effects (mortality, morphology, and growth), identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways, and determined transcriptomic points of departure (tPoDs) for each compound. Results indicated that PFOS exhibited the highest relative potency, followed by PFECHS and then FBSA. While similarities were observed among the ranked DEGs across all compounds, over-representation analysis revealed slight differences. Notably, PFOS demonstrated the lowest tPoD identified to date. These findings raise concerns regarding the safety of emerging replacement PFASs and challenge assumptions about PFAS toxicity solely resulting from their accumulative potential. As replacement PFASs proliferate in the environment, this study underscores the need for heightened scrutiny of their effects and questions current regulatory thresholds."

Machine learning approaches are presented that use spatially limited high-frequency monitoring and spatially distributed discrete samples to estimate the daily stream-specific conductance across a watershed. We compare the predictive performance of space- and time-unaware Random Forest models and space- and time-aware Recurrent Graph Convolution Neural Network models (KGE: 0.67 and 0.64, respectively) and use explainable artificial intelligence methods to interpret model predictions and understand salinization drivers.

These models capture seasonality for the winter first flush of deicers, and the streams with elevated predictions correspond well with indicators of deicer application. This result suggests that these models can be used to identify potential salinity-impaired streams for winter best management practices. Daily salinity predictions are driven primarily by land cover (urbanization) trends that may represent anthropogenic salinization processes and weather at time scales up to three months. Such modeling approaches are likely transferable to other watersheds and can be applied to further understand salinization risks and drivers."

MeHg trophic transfer is a critical driver of risk: MeHg is generally biomagnified by a factor of 8.3 ± 7.5 from one trophic level to the next, averaged across freshwater communities (mean ± standard deviation). This variability can produce disparate risks even where basal MeHg concentrations are similar. Taxonomy may be one driver of this variability: physiologically diverse groups, like vertebrates and invertebrates, may assimilate MeHg differently. To determine whether taxonomy affects trophic transfer efficiency, we conducted a meta-analysis characterizing predatory invertebrate MeHg biomagnification. Our analyses estimated that freshwater predatory invertebrates biomagnify MeHg by factors of 2.1 ± 0.2 to 4.3 ± 0.3, with a 98.9 ± 0.4% posterior probability that factors are below 5 (mean ± standard error). When vertebrates or primary producers were included, a site’s trophic magnification factor was 18.6 ± 6.2 to 54.1 ± 7.7% higher than estimates for invertebrates alone. Biomagnification was inversely correlated to prey MeHg concentration and varied among systematic and functional groups. These data suggest that predatory invertebrates biomagnify MeHg less efficiently than vertebrates and that a community’s diversity and structure determine its biomagnification efficiency. Incorporating organismal variation in trophic transfer estimates may improve the assessment, communication, and management of MeHg risk."

In this study, pathways were used to link effects and toxicants. By pathways evaluated by the concentration-dependent transcriptome, individual effects were extended to molecular mechanisms encompassing 135 pathways corresponding to 6 biological processes. Accordingly, mechanism-based identification of toxicants was achieved by constructing a pathway toxicant database containing 2413 chemical–pathway interactions and identifying pathway active fragments of 72 pathways. The developed method was applied to two different wastewaters, industrial wastewater OB and municipal wastewater HL. Although lethality and teratogenesis were both observed at the individual level, different molecular mechanisms were revealed by pathways, with cardiotoxicity- and genotoxicity-related pathways significantly enriched in OB, and neurotoxicity- and environmental information processing-related pathways significantly enriched in HL. Further suspect and nontargeted screening generated 59 and 86 causative toxicants in OB and HL, respectively, among which 29 toxicants were confirmed, that interacted with over 90% of enriched pathways and contributed over 50% of individual effects. After upgrading treatments based on causative toxicants, consistent removal of toxicants, pathway effects, and individual effects were observed.

The Early Paleozoic paleolatitudinal position of the terranes in the northern Tibetan Plateau is the key to unraveling the evolution of the Proto‐Tethys Ocean. We present the first Late Cambrian paleomagnetic results from the Oulongbuluke terrane (OT), in the northern Tibetan Plateau. The mean paleomagnetic direction for 16 sites is Ds = 196.2°, Is = −36.9° with κs = 31.5, α95 = 6.7°, corresponding to a paleopole at 68.2°S/51.9°E with dp/dm = 4.6°/7.8°. Rock magnetic and petrologic analyses demonstrate the primary origin of the magnetic mineralogy. This paleomagnetic result defines the Late Cambrian paleolatitude of the OT as 20.6 ± 4.6°S (reference point: 37.2°N/96.6°E). Combined paleomagnetic and geological evidence suggests that the terranes in the northern Tibetan Plateau were located to the northwest of the Indian plate of Gondwana during the Late Cambrian."

Here, we developed a sustainability index for vegetation systems (vegetation sustainability index, VSI) from water demand and supply aspects based on reliability, resilience, and vulnerability in arid and semi‐arid areas. VSI was built upon a vegetation overplanting index (dLAI) which is the difference between the maximum LAI supported by precipitation (LAIp) and the observed LAI (LAIobs).

Lava flows crossing the shoreline generated sounds that were recorded by a network of hydrophones. We show that short‐duration, broadband signals associated with lava‐water interactions occurred throughout the eruption but increased in number when the Ahalanui ocean entry initiated on July 11. These terminated in early August coincident with the eruption's end. We compare hydroacoustic data with transmission loss models and eruption photographs to show that coastal explosive activity was poorly recorded by the hydrophone network. Similarly, strong hydroacoustic signals did not correlate with observed activity. These results suggest that acoustic signals were generated by lava flowing up to 100 s of meters offshore.

Here, we utilize the four‐spacecraft observations from the MMS mission to investigate an event of quasi‐perpendicular bow shock crossing. The periodic oscillations of shock normal directions and normal velocities support the scenario of surface wave propagation in the tangential direction. We also reconstruct the shock profile along the normal direction, and its monotonic shape further excludes the occurrence of shock reformation. These ripples are found to modulate the reflected ions and whistler wave packets, which adds to the complexity of the bow shock plasma environments."

Understanding the temporal dynamics of soil microbial biomass is crucial for assessing soil ecosystem functions and services, yet these dynamics are globally uncertain. Here, we compiled a data set of soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) from 1493 studies between 1988 and 2019 to elucidate their temporal trends and potential drivers. Results showed that global MBC and MBN significantly decreased by 0.033 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 and 0.007 Mg N ha−1 yr−1 at 0–30 cm soil depth, between 1988 and 2019, respectively, which might be primarily attributed to the warming of the climate, the increase in global precipitation, and reduction of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. The rate of decline in MBC and MBN showed a non‐linear trend: following a decline from 1988 to 1999, it slowed down until 2014, likely due to the global warming hiatus. Afterward, the pace of decline increased again from 2015 to 2019. Boreal biomes experienced the largest decrease in soil microbial biomass with the reduction rate of MBC being 4.3 times higher than in temperate biomes, showing a higher sensitivity in boreal biomes to climate change. Grassland ecosystems also exhibited greater reductions, possibly driven by their degradation. These findings shed valuable insights on the long‐term dynamics of soil microbial biomass on a global scale over the last three decades. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of preserving soil microbial biomass as a key strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of future climate change, thereby sustaining ecosystem health and resilience."

Assessing Neoliberal Promises and Water Markets in Chile,"
Neoliberal approaches to water governance, pioneered in Chile in the 1980s, are reappearing today on the centerstage of the water policy debate. While advocates claim that strong property rights, limits on government authority, and water markets can enhance environmental sustainability, efficiency, neutrality, and equity in the distribution of water rights, limited empirical evidence exists on whether neoliberal policies have delivered on these key promises. In this paper, we combine hydrological analysis with a nationwide data set on government water rights allocations between 1981 and 2021 to determine when and where water has been allocated beyond sustainable limits. We then integrate water market transaction and agricultural data to assess how allocations and scarcity conditions relate to spatial and temporal patterns in irrigation, crop distribution, and water market activity. Our results indicate that 30% of catchments are overallocated, and that continued government allocations of water rights during scarcity exacerbate already‐high inequalities in the distribution of water. We find no evidence that scarcity or water markets induced improvements in numerous efficiency metrics. Overall, our results support growing claims that the neoliberal water model fails to fulfill its key promises, notably to the detriment of nature and marginalized rural communities."

 Animals rely on compensatory actions to maintain stability and navigate their environment efficiently. These actions depend on global visual motion cues known as optic-flow. While the optomotor response has been the traditional focus for studying optic-flow compensation in insects, its simplicity has been insufficient to determine the role of the intricate optic-flow processing network involved in visual course control.

Resequencing of 25 trees identify three subpopulations, with gene flow across West Africa distinct from East Africa.

 Future changes in solar radiation and rising temperatures will likely reduce global solar photovoltaic potential, but advancing photovoltaic technologies could counteract these effects. We investigate the potential of photovoltaic to satisfy energy demands given climate change and technological development. We find that conventional photovoltaic will require 0.5 to 1.2% of global land area to meet projected energy demands by 2085 without accounting for climate change effects. When considering climate impacts, this requirement increases to 0.7–1.5% of the global land area. However, utilising advanced photovoltaic technologies can reduce this area to 0.3–1.2%, effectively mitigating climate impacts. Regional climate change impacts vary substantially, resulting in photovoltaic potential decreases of up to 3% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and by up to 8% in South Asia.

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, particularly solid-state ones, play a pivotal role in spatial–temporal mapping by providing precise three-dimensional data of the environment, significantly enhancing remote sensing capabilities and adaptability to challenging environments compared to mechanical LiDAR systems. However, the limited field of view results in a sparse point cloud frame with few features, which poses challenges to feature matching, causes pose offset, and hinders spatial–temporal continuity, and further significant obstacle for existing vehicle-mounted mobile mapping methods. To address the above issues, we proposed a novel approach that integrating inertial measurement unit (IMU) with solid-state LiDAR. Specifically, it comprises two key modules: an initial localization mapping module, mitigating the limitations of solid-state LiDAR in positioning and mapping accuracy, and an attitude optimization mapping module utilizing real-time high-frequency IMU data to identify key frames for correcting initial attitudes and generating accurate 3D maps. The effectiveness of the method is validated through extensive experiments in complex community and high-speed urban road scenarios. Furthermore, our approach outperforms than the state-of-the-art techniques in test scenarios, achieving a significant 35% reduction in average absolute pose error and enhancing the robustness of vehicle-mounted mapping."

 Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements, necessitating accurate and timely detection of burned areas for post-fire management. This study focused on the immediate assessment of a recent major forest fire that occurred on March 15, 2024, in southwestern China. We comprehensively utilized high temporal resolution MODIS and Black Marble nighttime light images to monitor the fire’s development and introduced a novel method for detecting burned forest areas using a new Shadow-Enhanced Vegetation Index (SEVI) coupling with a machine learning technique. The SEVI effectively enhances the vegetation index (VI) values on shaded slopes and hence reduces the VI disparity between shaded and sunlit areas, which is critical for accurately extracting fire scars in such terrain. While SEVI primarily identifies burned forest areas, the Random Forest (RF) technique detects all burned areas, including both forested and non-forested regions. Consequently, the total burned area of the Yajiang forest fire was estimated at 23,588 ha, with the burned forest area covering 19,266 ha. The combination of SEVI and RF algorithms provided a comprehensive and efficient tool for identifying burned areas. Additionally, our study employed the Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index (RSEI) to assess the ecological impact of the fire on the region, uncovering an immediate 15 % decline in regional ecological conditions following the fire. The usage of RSEI has the potential to quantitatively understand ecological responses to the fire. The findings achieved in this study underscore the significance of precise fire-burned area extraction techniques for enhancing forest fire management and ecosystem recovery strategies, while also highlighting the broader ecological implications of such events."

 Yellow River is famous for its exceptionally higher suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), displaying significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity across diverse sections. Although SSC monitoring of the Yellow River and some of its tributaries has been achieved using Landsat data, it remains unclear whether the inclusion of higher spatial resolution satellites can expand the spatiotemporal monitoring capabilities for the Yellow River and most of its tributaries. In this study, we employed Sentinel-2 imagery, offering superior spatiotemporal resolution, to develop a higher-accurate SSC model and quantitatively evaluated its potential to improve the spatiotemporal coverage of SSC monitoring compared to Landsat satellites. For the Yellow River in the Loess Plateau, the optimized Sentinel-2 model exhibited superior accuracy, achieving R2 = 0.91, root mean square error of 728.76 mg/L, and unbiased percentage difference of 16.75%. Notably, distinct SSC distribution differences were observed across different rivers, indicating significant spatial heterogeneity (SSC: 0.58 – 3.01 × 105 mg/L). Moreover, Sentinel-2 showed a significant increase in observation frequency and spatial coverage (204.08% and 107.15%, respectively) compared to Landsat. An additional 35.29% increase in observation frequency was achieved through the combined satellite observation method. Furthermore, based on river width statistics, we found that upgrading the spatial resolution from 10 m to 1 m enhanced the coverage of observable river segments in the Loess Plateau by approximately 47.96%, and by about 50.56% globally. This study established a crucial scientific foundation for integrating Sentinel-2 and Landsat, enabling finer-scale monitoring and management of river sediment."

 Understanding the characteristics of the growth zones of live corals and competitive algae, including turf algae and macroalgae, is crucial for assessing the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. However, identifying live corals and competitive algae in multispectral satellite images is challenging because different objects can have similar spectra. To address this, we used two satellite images acquired at different times (Landsat thematic mapper (TM), Landsat operational land imager (OLI), or Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI)) to assess the growth zone characteristics of live corals and competitive algae. This assessment leveraged the seasonal dieback of competitive algae and the relative stability of live-coral growth zones over a short period. Specifically, we developed a normalized red–green difference index (NRGI) to segment live-coral-or-competitive-alga growth zones in satellite images. By comparing the segmentation results from an image captured during a period with few competitive algae and another image captured during a period with lush competitive algae, we estimated the growth zone areas of the live corals and competitive algae. Finally, we calculated the ratio of the competitive-alga growth zone area to the live-coral growth zone area (RCL). Experiments on eight typical coral islands and reefs in the South China Sea (SCS) from 1995 to 2022 revealed that: (1) the identification accuracies of live-coral-or-competitive-alga growth zones reached 80.3 % and 92.6 % during periods with few competitive algae (January to March) and lush competitive algae (April to October), respectively; (2) the RCL was well correlated with the coral-macroalgae encounter rate (an ecological index indicating the pressure of the competitive algae on the live corals) (r = 0.79, P<0.05); and (3) the trends in the growth zones of competitive algae and live corals, along with the RCL, were consistent with major ecological events in the SCS, such as coral bleaching, outbreak of Acanthaster planci, and black band disease. (4) Moreover, a time-lagged correlation was observed between heat stress and the RCL. In summary, the proposed approach is simple, effective, and feasible. The RCL is a valuable indicator of the status of coral reef ecosystems, highlighting the pressure of competitive algae on live corals and the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. This method introduces a novel application of multispectral satellite images for assessing coral reef ecosystems and has significant potential for future coral reef ecosystem monitoring."

 Accurate crop mapping is critical for agricultural decisions and food security. Despite the widespread use of machine learning and deep learning in remote sensing for crop classification, mapping crops in mountainous smallholder farming systems remains challenging. In particular, cloudy and rainy weather limits high-quality satellite imagery, potentially limiting the availability of reliable data for classification. Additionally, the substantial intraclass variability among multiple crops further impedes classification accuracy. In this context, this study sought to resolve these two issues by applying a hybrid approach that combines multisource remote sensing data and deep metric learning. For the first challenge, multisource remote sensing data, including Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data from the Google Earth Engine, were integrated to provide more comprehensive information on crop growth and differences. To address the second challenge, we proposed a 2D-CNN network enhanced by CBAM attention and an online hard example mining strategy. The network focuses on the channel-spatial information of crop samples and their surrounding pixels while promoting the convergence of similar crop samples within the latent feature space and enhancing the separation among different samples. This process is exemplified through a case study of crop mapping in Jiangjin District, Chongqing city, an area representing the typical mountain smallholder farming systems in Southwest China. Compared to six state-of-the-art methods, RF, SVM, XGBoost, ResNet18, and DMLOHM, our approach achieves the highest performance, with 93.99% overall accuracy, a kappa coefficient of 0.9253, and excellent F1 scores across numerous crop categories. The results of this study provide an effective solution for crop classification in complex mountainous regions and have promising potential for mapping under challenging natural conditions."

 Monitoring the distribution and size of long-living large shrubs, such as junipers, is crucial for assessing the long-term impacts of global change on high-mountain ecosystems. While deep learning models have shown remarkable success in object segmentation, adapting these models to detect shrub species with polymorphic nature remains challenging. In this research, we release a large dataset of individual shrub delineations on freely available satellite imagery and use an instance segmentation model to map all junipers over the treeline for an entire biosphere reserve (Sierra Nevada, Spain). To optimize performance, we introduced a novel dual data construction approach: using photo-interpreted (PI) data for model development and fieldwork (FW) data for validation. To account for the polymorphic nature of junipers during model evaluation, we developed a soft version of the Intersection over Union metric. Finally, we assessed the uncertainty of the resulting map in terms of canopy cover and density of shrubs per size class. Our model achieved an F1-score in shrub delineation of 87.87% on the PI data and 76.86% on the FW data. The R2 and RMSE of the observed versus predicted relationship were 0.63 and 6.67% for canopy cover, and 0.90 and 20.62 for shrub density. The greater density of larger shrubs in lower altitudes and smaller shrubs in higher altitudes observed in the model outputs was also present in the PI and FW data, suggesting an altitudinal uplift in the optimal performance of the species. This study demonstrates that deep learning applied on freely available high-resolution satellite imagery is useful to detect medium to large shrubs of high ecological value at the regional scale, which could be expanded to other high-mountains worldwide and to historical and fothcoming imagery."

 Detailed knowledge of vegetation patterns allows to evaluate mire ecosystems and their dynamics. The use of hyperspectral information has the benefits of exploring spectral characteristics of species and vegetation modelling. Our study employed multi-scale and multi-source hyperspectral imaging with a handheld camera in the field and an UAV (Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle) sensor covering the wavelengths of 400 – 1000 nm. Plot-level spectra acquired with a UAV and field spectra collected at 1 m height were combined to develop a spectral library for Sphagnum moss species. This library was then used to map dominant Sphagnum species in a Finnish Aapa mire complex using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier. Classification performance assessment was supported by calculating a water index from the UAV-information. Additionally, we examined the transferability of site-specific spectral libraries to an aapa mire with similar vegetation. The results showed little spectral variation in the plot spectrum between the sensors. A fusion of species- and plot-level libraries yielded the highest accuracy of 62 %. For both mires, there was a great variation among the class accuracies. Floating mosses had an accuracy of 86 %, followed by lawn-forming Sphagnum balticum with 77 %. For the test site, the latter species was mapped with an accuracy of 59 %. Red moss species achieved low accuracies of 45 % and 38 %, likely due to effects from sub-pixel and mixed-pixel effects of neighbouring graminoid species and the presence of litter. This might have also enhanced the contrast of adjacent pixels contributing to spectral alterations. Water table depth measurements and the water index revealed a hydrological preference for most species, with classification performance notably improving with higher water index values. We recommend collecting on-site hyperspectral information at varying hydrological circumstances to build a comprehensive spectral library for mire vegetation and modelling."

Nevertheless, a comprehensive comparison of the temperature sensitivity of methane-related microbial processes remains elusive. Here, we revealed that the temperature sensitivity of methane production (activation energy (Ea) = 0.94 eV; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78–1.10 eV) and aerobic (Ea = 0.49 eV; 95% CI, 0.34–0.65 eV) and anaerobic (Ea = 0.46 eV; 95% CI, 0.30–0.62 eV) methane oxidation exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity across 12 Chinese paddy fields spanning 35° longitude and 18° latitude. In addition, the Ea values of aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation were significantly positively and negatively correlated to the latitude, respectively, while there was no significant correlation between the Ea of methane production and the latitude. Overall, there were no soil factors that had a significant effect on the Ea of methane production. The Ea of aerobic methane oxidation was primarily influenced by the contents of ammonium and clay, whereas the Ea of anaerobic methane oxidation was mainly influenced by the conductivity. Despite the variation, the overall temperature sensitivity of methane production was significantly higher than that of oxidation at a continental scale; therefore, an increase in the emission of methane from paddy fields will be predicted under future warming. Taken together, our study revealed the characteristics of temperature sensitivity of methane production and aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation simultaneously in Chinese paddy fields, highlighting the potential roles of soil factors in influencing temperature sensitivity."

We observed that DOMa and DOMt converged toward a similar composition under the combined light and microbial treatment, driven by the removal of source-specific compositions along with the production of refractory, carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM). For CRAM enrichment, microbial processes played a greater role for DOMa, while phototransformation was more important for DOMt. The co-occurrence patterns between DOM molecules and bacteria showed that DOM molecular composition influenced the bacterial community. More complex DOM-bacteria interactions were observed for DOMt compared to DOMa, suggesting that greater bacterial cooperation was necessary for transforming DOMt.

PT‐JPL model was used to derive latent heat flux from thermal images at the canopy‐level, showing strong agreement with tower measurements (R2 = 0.70–0.96 at Niwot, 0.59–0.78 at Harvard at half‐hourly to monthly scales) and daily RMSE of 33.5 W/m2 (Niwot) and 52.8 W/m2 (Harvard). Tree‐level analysis revealed species‐specific responses to drought, with lodgepole pine exhibiting greater tolerance than Engelmann spruce at Niwot and red oak showing heightened resistance than red maple at Harvard.

Smith,An Ocean Memory Perspective: Disentangling Atmospheric Control of Decadal Variability in the North Atlantic Ocean,"An ocean memory framework is proposed to reveal the atmosphere's influence on ocean temperatures. Anomalous atmospheric forcing alters the ocean state through two mechanisms: short‐term, local effects involving air− ${-}$sea heat fluxes and Ekman circulation, and long‐term, far‐field effects involving changes from overturning and gyre circulations. The framework employs the Green function's method to incorporate both effects, enabling the quantification of ocean memory and the contribution of atmospheric forcing to ocean thermal variability. The framework is employed to examine the North Atlantic Oscillation's (NAO) influence on the North Atlantic Ocean variability, including the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, with its memory estimated to be 10–20 $10\mbox{--}20$ years. The NAO and variability in the North Atlantic jet speed explain up to 30% of ocean decadal variability, primarily driven by temporal changes in ocean heat transport. Therefore, decadal fluctuations in ocean temperatures cannot be accurately modeled solely as a passive response to stochastic atmospheric forcing."

The authors develop an in-situ magnetic imaging technique at megabar pressures, revealing the magnetic transition of magnetite. 
 High-pressure diamond anvil cells have been widely used to create novel states of matter. Nevertheless, the lack of universal in-situ magnetic measurement techniques at megabar pressures makes it difficult to understand the underlying physics of materials’ behavior at extreme conditions, such as high-temperature superconductivity of hydrides and the formation or destruction of the local magnetic moments in magnetic systems. Here, we break through the limitations of pressure on quantum sensors by modulating the uniaxial stress along the nitrogen-vacancy axis and develop the in-situ magnetic detection technique at megabar pressures with high sensitivity (

By directly imaging the magnetic field and the evolution of magnetic domains, we observe the macroscopic magnetic transition of Fe3O4 in the megabar pressure range from ferrimagnetic (α-Fe3O4) to weak ferromagnetic (β-Fe3O4) and finally to paramagnetic (γ-Fe3O4). The scenarios for magnetic changes in Fe3O4 characterized here shed light on the direct magnetic microstructure observation in bulk materials at high pressure and contribute to understanding magnetism evolution in the presence of numerous complex factors such as spin crossover, altered magnetic interactions and structural phase transitions.

Here the authors propose to combine the immunostimulatory properties of LDRT with the cell killing/shrinkage properties of high dose RT within the same tumor mass as a strategy to optimize RT-induced anti-tumor immune responses. 
 The efficacy and side effects of radiotherapy (RT) depend on parameters like dose and the volume of irradiated tissue. RT induces modulations of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) that are dependent on the dose. Low dose RT (LDRT, i.e., single doses of 0.5–2 Gy) has been shown to promote immune infiltration into the tumor. Here we hypothesize that partial tumor irradiation combining the immunostimulatory/non-lethal properties of LDRT with cell killing/shrinkage properties of high dose RT (HDRT) within the same tumor mass could enhance anti-tumor responses when combined with immunomodulators. In models of colorectal and breast cancer in immunocompetent female mice, partial irradiation (PI) with millimetric precision to deliver LDRT (2 Gy) and HDRT (16 Gy) within the same tumor induces substantial tumor control when combined with anti-PD1. Using flow cytometry, cytokine profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify a crosstalk between the TIME of the differentially irradiated tumor volumes. PI reshapes tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells into more cytotoxic and interferon-activated phenotypes but also increases the infiltration of pro-tumor neutrophils driven by CXCR2. The combination of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 with PD1 blockade and PI improves tumor control and mouse survival. Our results suggest a strategy to reduce RT toxicity and improve the therapeutic index of RT and immune checkpoint combinations.

 Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, one of the most common forms of hepatitis worldwide, is often associated with extrahepatic, particularly renal, manifestations. However, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we report the development of a de novo immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis (GN) in a kidney transplant recipient with chronic hepatitis E. Applying immunostaining, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry after laser-capture microdissection, we show that GN develops in parallel with increasing glomerular deposition of a non-infectious, genome-free and non-glycosylated HEV open reading frame 2 (ORF2) capsid protein. No productive HEV infection of kidney cells is detected. Patients with acute hepatitis E display similar but less pronounced deposits. Our results establish a link between the production of HEV ORF2 protein and the development of hepatitis E-associated GN in the immunocompromised state. The formation of glomerular IgG-HEV ORF2 immune complexes discovered here provides a potential mechanistic explanation of how the hepatotropic HEV can cause variable renal manifestations. These findings directly provide a tool for etiology-based diagnosis of hepatitis E-associated GN as a distinct entity and suggest therapeutic implications.

Ignoring this effect could lead to a 4-19% overestimation of future food production. 
 Global warming poses an unprecedented threat to agroecosystems. Although temperature increases are more pronounced during winter than in other seasons, the impact of winter warming on crop biomass carbon has not been elucidated. Here we integrate global observational data with a decade-long field experiment to uncover a significant negative correlation between winter soil temperature and crop biomass carbon. For every degree Celsius increase in winter soil temperature, straw and grain biomass carbon decreased by 6.6 ( ± 1.7) g kg-1 and 10.2 ( ± 2.3) g kg-1, respectively. This decline is primarily attributed to the loss of soil organic matter and micronutrients induced by warming. Ignoring the adverse effects of winter warming on crop biomass carbon could result in an overestimation of total food production by 4% to 19% under future warming scenarios. Our research highlights the critical need to incorporate winter warming into agricultural productivity models for more effective climate adaptation strategies.

 The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is widely employed as a model organism to study basic biological mechanisms. However, transgenic C. elegans are generated by manual injection, which remains low-throughput and labor-intensive, limiting the scope of approaches benefitting from large-scale transgenesis. Here, we report a robotic microinjection system, integrating a microfluidic device capable of reliable worm immobilization, transfer, and rotation, for high-speed injection of C. elegans. The robotic system provides an injection speed 2-3 times faster than that of experts with 7–22 years of experience while maintaining comparable injection quality and only limited trials needed by users to become proficient. We further employ our system in a large-scale reverse genetic screen using multiplexed alternative splicing reporters, and find that the TDP-1 RNA-binding protein regulates alternative splicing of zoo-1 mRNA, which encodes variants of the zonula occludens tight junction proteins.

 Water electro-oxidation to form H2O2 is an important way to produce H2O2 which is widely applied in industry. However, its mechanism is under debate and HO(ads), hydroxyl group adsorbed onto the surface of the electrode, is regarded as an important intermediate. Herein, we study the mechanism of water oxidation to H2O2 at Pt electrode using in-situ Raman spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and find peroxide bond mainly originated from the coupling of two CO32- via a C2O62- intermediate. By quantifying the 18O isotope in the product, we find that 93% of H2O2 was formed via the CO32- coupling route and 7% of H2O2 is from OH(ads)-CO3•− route. The OH(ads)-OH(ads) coupling route has a negligible contribution. The comparison of various electrodes shows that the strong adsorption of CO3(ads) at the electrode surface is essential. Combining with a commercial cathode catalyst to produce H2O2 during oxygen reduction, we assemble a flow cell in which the cathode and anode simultaneously produce H2O2. It shows a Faradaic efficiency of 150% of H2O2 at 1 A cm−2 with a cell voltage of 2.3 V.

 Vinca alkaloids, a class of tubulin-binding agent, are widely used in treating cancer, yet the emerging resistance compromises their efficacy. Hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP), a microtubule-associated protein displaying heightened expression across various cancer types, reduces cancer cells’ sensitivity to vinca-alkaloid drugs upon overexpression. However, the molecular basis behind this drug resistance remains unknown. Here we discover a tubulin-binding domain within HURP, and establish its role in regulating microtubule growth. Cryo-EM analysis reveals interactions between HURP’s tubulin-binding domain and the vinca domain on β-tubulin -- the site targeted by vinca alkaloid drugs. Importantly, HURP competes directly with vinorelbine, a vinca alkaloid-based chemotherapeutic agent, countering microtubule growth defects caused by vinorelbine both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings elucidate a mechanism driving drug resistance in HURP-overexpressing cancer cells and emphasize HURP tubulin-binding domain’s role in mitotic spindle assembly. This underscores its potential as a therapeutic target to improve cancer treatment. Vinca alkaloids, tubulin-binding agents that impair microtubule growth, are widely used in cancer treatment.

 Humans excel at extracting structurally-determined meaning from speech despite inherent physical variability. This study explores the brain’s ability to predict and understand spoken language robustly. It investigates the relationship between structural and statistical language knowledge in brain dynamics, focusing on phase and amplitude modulation. Using syntactic features from constituent hierarchies and surface statistics from a transformer model as predictors of forward encoding models, we reconstructed cross-frequency neural dynamics from MEG data during audiobook listening. Our findings challenge a strict separation of linguistic structure and statistics in the brain, with both aiding neural signal reconstruction. Syntactic features have a more temporally spread impact, and both word entropy and the number of closing syntactic constituents are linked to the phase-amplitude coupling of neural dynamics, implying a role in temporal prediction and cortical oscillation alignment during speech processing. Our results indicate that structured and statistical information jointly shape neural dynamics during spoken language comprehension and suggest an integration process via a cross-frequency coupling mechanism.

 Many state-of-the-art climate models are unable to reproduce the observed 20th century surface warming pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean, casting doubt on the robustness of future projections. Here, we examine past changes in the tropical Pacific upper ocean spatial pattern using paleoclimate reconstructions from proxies and simulations from a multi-model ensemble. The proxy results demonstrate that during the Last Glacial Maximum, when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were lower than present, temperatures in the western tropical Pacific Ocean decreased more than in the east, leading to an El Niño-like cooling pattern. This result contrasts with the zonally uniform cooling pattern observed in model simulations, highlighting the common issue of models overestimating the sensitivity of eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures to greenhouse forcing. Our proxy results imply that the western Pacific may warm more than the east in response to future climate change, producing a La Niña-like surface warming pattern.

It is found that the UHI intensifies under HW conditions with the UHI intensity gradually weakening from the surface upwards. The daytime UHIs during the HW are 3.68 K (29.27 %), 1.41 K (33.52 %) and 1.04 K (36.97 %) higher than those during the pre-HW at the surface, near-surface and in the PBL, respectively, while the nighttime UHIs have no significant response to the HW at least for this case. The mean UHIs during the HW period at the surface, near-surface (2 m) and in the PBL are 6.83 K (2.68 K), 2.45 K (1.34 K), and 1.73 K (0.04 K) in the daytime (nighttime), respectively. The PBL UHI generally exists only in the daytime potentially caused by the thermal convective diffusion. The near-surface and PBL UHIs are significantly affected by the horizontal advection, resulting in different UHI intensities and variations against rural regions in different orientations. Cold advection from the Yangtze River (the ocean) in the riverside (coastal) rural region corresponds to the great UHI intensification, while the strong cold advection in the urban region well explains the fast UHI weakening.

Following an unusual westward trajectory, TC Gulab made landfall on the east coast of India, traversed central India, and reintensified over the Arabian Sea into TC Shaheen. This study employed an online Eulerian water vapor tracer (WVT) tool embedded within the Weather Research and Forecasting model to investigate the role of land in terms of soil moisture (SM) and land use land cover (LULC) in persistence of TC Gulab over central India. We quantified the contributions of sub-regions and dominant LULC types within the Indian subcontinent to the precipitation associated with TC Gulab. Our findings indicate that evapotranspiration across the entire Indian subcontinent contributed approximately 30% to the post-landfall precipitation associated with TC Gulab. The highest contribution originated from the northwestern region, followed by the northeast. Croplands, the dominant LULC type, were the primary contributors, followed by forests. Despite changing the dominant land cover from cropland to forest, the low-pressure system persisted over land while altering the spatial patterns of precipitation. Sensitivity experiments demonstrated a linear decrease in precipitation originating from land with decreasing SM. Notably, there is a disproportionate decline in total precipitation with decreasing SM. Further analysis separating atmospheric vapor sources into land and ocean contributions using WVT revealed a compensatory mechanism. The contribution of oceanic vapor to atmospheric vapor over land increased when SM decreased due to increase in the latent heat over ocean. However, the total atmospheric vapor remained low, ultimately leading to a lower total precipitation. Although SM plays a role, our results highlight the importance of oceanic and atmospheric processes in determining TC persistence over land. This study offers valuable insights into the dynamics of land–atmosphere interactions during low-pressure systems of TCs."

Tropical homegardens, a form of agroforestry, may have the potential to align concurrent demands for biodiversity conservation and food security in urban environments. Nevertheless, this depends on land-use decision-making strategies that are enabled by household livelihood assets. We examined which livelihood assets are associated with homegarden agrobiodiversity and food availability and accessibility in Kerala, India, the nature of these associations, and whether they vary along urbanisation gradients using data from 304 homegardens. We observed higher plant species richness closer to the urban centre and in smaller homegardens. Meanwhile, yields and share of household food consumption from homegardens tend to be higher farther away from urban centres. Assets like fertilizer use, irrigation and kinship affiliation are positively associated with both homegarden agrobiodiversity and food outcomes. Conversely, homegarden size is negatively associated with biodiversity outcomes across urbanisation gradients and positively associated with yield outcomes furthest away from urban centre. Some assets like family labour and farming association membership were only positively associated with food outcomes, while others like external labour availability were positively associated only with plant diversity in the urban centre. Overall, synergies between homegarden agrobiodiversity and household food security requires inputs to natural processes, such as irrigation and soil fertility, and social processes like knowledge sharing and social cohesion, especially in urban peripheries. We emphasize the relevance of homegardens and enhancing livelihood assets for food-secure households in biodiverse urban environments."

Using high-resolution (∼0.1° for the ocean) Community Earth System Model (CESM-HR) simulations under a high-carbon emission scenario, we investigate the role of mesoscale eddies in regulating the response of the Subantarctic Front (SAF) to global warming. The CESM-HR simulates more realistic oceanic fronts and mesoscale eddies in the Southern Ocean than a coarse-resolution (∼1° for the ocean) CESM. Under global warming, the SAF is projected to intensify. The mean flow temperature advection intensifies the front, whereas the mesoscale-eddy-induced temperature advection and atmospheric dampening play primary (∼67%) and secondary (∼28%) roles in counteracting the effect of mean flow temperature advection. Our study suggests the importance of mesoscale eddies on inhibiting the SAF intensification under global warming and necessity of mesoscale-eddy-resolving simulations for faithful projection of future climate changes in the Southern Ocean."

The standardised benchmarking framework is applied to assess model performance through both statistical and process-based metrics. Ultimately, we identify two independent model groups that are suitable for dynamical downscaling in the Southeast Asian region. 
 Downscaling global climate models (GCMs) provides crucial high-resolution data needed for informed decision-making at regional scales. However, there is no uniform approach to select the most suitable GCMs. Over Southeast Asia (SEA), observations are sparse and have large uncertainties, complicating GCM selection especially for rainfall. To guide this selection, we apply a standardised benchmarking framework to select CMIP6 GCMs for dynamical downscaling over SEA, addressing current observational limitations. This framework identifies fit-for-purpose models through a two-step process: (a) selecting models that meet minimum performance requirements in simulating the fundamental characteristics of rainfall (e.g. bias, spatial pattern, annual cycle and trend) and (b) selecting models from (a) to further assess whether key precipitation drivers (monsoon) and teleconnections from modes of variability are captured, i.e. the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). GCMs generally exhibit wet biases, particularly over the complex terrain of the Maritime Continent. Evaluations from the first step identify 19 out of 32 GCMs that meet our minimum performance expectations in simulating rainfall. These models also consistently capture atmospheric circulations and teleconnections with modes of variability over the region but overestimate their strength. Ultimately, we identify eight GCMs meeting our performance expectations. There are obvious, high-performing GCMs from allied modelling groups, highlighting the dependency of the subset of models identified from the framework. Therefore, further tests of model independence, data availability and future climate change spread are conducted, resulting in a final subset of two independent models that align with our a priori expectations for downscaling over the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment –Southeast Asia (CORDEX-SEA)."

Climate change and large‐scale ecological restoration programs have profoundly influenced vegetation greening and gross primary productivity (GPP) in China's drylands. However, the specific pathways through which climatic factors and vegetation greening influence GPP remain poorly understood. This study examines the spatiotemporal changes in GPP across China's drylands from 2001 to 2020 and investigates the direct and indirect effects of climatic factors and leaf area index (LAI) on GPP. The results reveal that the overall improvement in vegetation cover has positively increased GPP in these regions. Although the direct effects of climatic factors on GPP are minimal, they exert a substantial indirect effect by regulating vegetation growth, highlighting that LAI is a key intermediary in mediating the effects of climatic factors on GPP. Furthermore, these complex interactions vary significantly along the aridity gradient. This study emphasizes the necessity of comprehensively considering the intricate interactions among multiple climate and vegetation factors."

 In recent years, perovskite has been widely adopted in series-connected monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs) to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction solar cells. Perovskite/organic TSCs, comprising a wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cell (pero-SC) as the front cell and a narrow-bandgap organic solar cell (OSC) as the rear cell, have recently drawn attention owing to the good stability and potential high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1,2,3,4. However, WBG pero-SCs usually exhibit higher voltage losses than regular pero-SCs, which limits the performance of TSCs5,6. One of the major obstacles comes from interfacial recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface, and it is important to develop effective surface passivation strategies to pursue higher PCE of perovskite/organic TSCs7. Here we exploit a new surface passivator cyclohexane 1,4-diammonium diiodide (CyDAI2), which naturally contains two isomeric structures with ammonium groups on the same or opposite sides of the hexane ring (denoted as cis-CyDAI2 and trans-CyDAI2, respectively), and the two isomers demonstrate completely different surface interaction behaviors. The cis-CyDAI2 passivation treatment reduces the Quasi–Fermi level splitting (QFLS)–open circuit voltage (Voc) mismatch of the WBG pero-SCs with a bandgap of 1.88 eV and enhanced its Voc to 1.36 V. Combining the cis-CyDAI2 treated perovskite and the organic active layer with a narrow-bandgap of 1.24 eV, the constructed monolithic perovskite/organic TSC demonstrates a PCE of 26.4% (certified as 25.7%)."

 Perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have undergone a rapid development in the last decade. However, there is still a lack of systematic studies to investigate whether the empirical rules of working lifetime assessment used in silicon solar cells can be applied to pero-SCs. It is commonly believed that pero-SCs show enhanced stability under day/night cycling due to the reported self-healing effect in the dark.1,2 While we discovered that the degradation of highly efficient FAPbI3 pero-SCs is in fact much faster under natural day/night cycling mode, questioning the widely accepted approach to estimate the operational lifetime of pero-SCs based on continuous mode testing. We reveal the key factor to be the lattice strain caused by thermal expansion/shrinking of the perovskite during the operation, an effect that gradually relaxes under the continuous-illumination mode but cycles synchronously under the cycling mode.3,4 The periodic lattice strain under the cycling mode results in deep trap accumulation and chemical degradation during operation, decreasing the ion migration potential and hence the device lifetime.5 We introduce phenylselenenyl chloride (Ph-Se-Cl) to regulate the perovskite lattice strain during day/night cycling, which achieved the certified efficiency of 26.3% and a 10-time improved T80 lifetime under the cycling mode after the modification."

 The fabrication of scalable all-perovskite tandem solar cells is considered an attractive route to commercialize perovskite photovoltaic modules1. However, The certified efficiency of 1-cm2 scale all-perovskite tandem solar cells lags behind their small-area (~0.1 cm2) counterparts2,3. This performance deficit originates from inhomogeneity in wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at a large scale. The inhomogeneity is known to be introduced at the bottom interface and within the perovskite bulk itself4,5. Here we uncover another crucial source for the inhomogeneity – the top interface formed during the deposition of the electron transport layer (ETL, C60). Meanwhile, the poor ETL interface is also a significant limitation of device performance. We address this issue by introducing a mixture of 4-fluorophenethylamine (F-PEA) and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA) to create a tailored two-dimensional perovskite layer (TTDL), in which F-PEA forms a two-dimensional perovskite at the surface reducing contact losses and inhomogeneity, CF3-PA enhances charge extraction and transport. As a result, we demonstrate a high open-circuit voltage of 1.35 V and an efficiency of 20.5% in 1.77-eV WBG PSCs at a square centimeter scale. By stacking with a narrow-bandgap perovskite sub-cell, we report 1.05 cm2 all-perovskite tandem cells delivering 28.5% (certified 28.2%) efficiency, the highest among all reported so far. Our work showcases the importance of treating the top perovskite/ETL contact for upscaling perovskite solar cells."

Here, the authors regulate the charge transfer state disorder and rate of back charge transfer through a ternary system, achieving low non-radiative energy loss of 0.183 eV and device efficiency of 20.25%. 
 The high non-radiative energy loss is a bottleneck issue that impedes the improvement of organic solar cells. The formation of triplet exciton is thought to be the main source of the large non-radiative energy loss. Decreasing the rate of back charge transfer is considered as an effective approach to alleviate the relaxation of the charge-transfer state and the triplet exciton generation. Herein, we develops an efficient ternary system based on D18:N3-BO:F-BTA3 by regulating the charge-transfer state disorder and the rate of back charge transfer of the blend. With the addition of F-BTA3, a well-defined morphology with a more condensed molecular packing is obtained. Moreover, a reduced charge-transfer state disorder is demonstrated in the ternary blend, which decreases the rate of back charge transfer as well as the triplet exciton formation, and therefore hinders the non-radiative recombination pathways. Consequently, D18:N3-BO:F-BTA3-based device produces a low non-radiative energy loss of 0.183 eV and a record-high efficiency of 20.25%. This work not only points towards the significant role of the charge-transfer state disorder on the suppression of triplet exciton formation and the non-radiative energy loss, but also provides a valuable insight for enhancing the performance of OSCs.

The antibody weakly inhibits enzymatic activity but confers protection in female mice, mainly via ADCC function. The cryo-EM structure shows that 18_14D binds to a unique epitope on the lateral surface of the N6 tetramer, preventing the formation of tightly closed NA tetramers. These findings contribute to the molecular understanding of protective immune responses to NA of AIVs in humans and open an avenue for the rational design of NA-based vaccines. Understanding the antibody response to influenza neuraminidase (NA) can identify protective epitopes. Here, the authors isolate an antibody from an H5N6 infected patient, characterize the epitope on the N6 tetramer, and show that it’s protective in female mice."

Here, authors report a redox-mediated decoupled seawater direct electrolysis strategy to suppress the chlorine electro-oxidation side reaction. 
 Seawater direct electrolysis (SDE) using renewable energy provides a sustainable pathway to harness abundant oceanic hydrogen resources. However, the side-reaction of the chlorine electro-oxidation reaction (ClOR) severely decreased direct electrolysis efficiency of seawater and gradually corrodes the anode. In this study, a redox-mediated strategy is introduced to suppress the ClOR, and a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis (DSDE) system incorporating a separate O2 evolution reactor is established. Ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]3−/4−) serves as an electron-mediator between the cell and the reactor, thereby enabling a more dynamically favorable half-reaction to supplant the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This alteration involves a straightforward, single-electron-transfer anodic reaction without gas precipitation and effectively eliminates the generation of chlorine-containing byproducts. By operating at low voltages (~1.37 V at 10 mA cm−2 and ~1.57 V at 100 mA cm−2) and maintaining stability even in a Cl−-saturated seawater electrolyte, this system has the potential of undergoing decoupled seawater electrolysis with zero chlorine emissions. Further improvements in the high-performance redox-mediators and catalysts can provide enhanced cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the DSDE system.

 This study aims to identify colorectal cancer (CRC)-related proteomic profiles and develop a prediction model for CRC onset by integrating proteomic profiles with genetic and non-genetic factors (QCancer-15) to improve the risk stratification and estimate of personalized initial screening age. Here, using a two-stage strategy, we prioritize 15 protein biomarkers as predictors to construct a protein risk score (ProS). The risk prediction model integrating proteomic profiles with polygenic risk score (PRS) and QCancer-15 risk score (QCancer-S) shows improved performance (C-statistic: 0.79 vs. 0.71, P = 4.94E–03 in training cohort; 0.75 vs 0.69, P = 5.49E–04 in validation cohort) and net benefit than QCancer-S alone. The combined model markedly stratifies the risk of CRC onset. Participants with high ProS, PRS, or combined risk score are proposed to start screening at age 46, 41, or before 40 years old. In this work, the integration of blood proteomics with PRS and QCancer-15 demonstrates improved performance for risk stratification and clinical implication for the derivation of risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening, which may contribute to the decision-making process for CRC screening.

 Maximizing materials utilization efficiency via enhancing their reconfigurability and multifunctionality offers a promising avenue in addressing the global challenges in sustainability. To this end, significant efforts have been made in developing reconfigurable multifunctional smart materials, which can exhibit remarkable behaviors such as morphing and self-healing. However, the difficulty in efficiently manipulating and controlling matter at the building block level with manageable cost and complexity, which is crucial to achieving superior responsiveness to environmental clues and stimuli, has significantly hindered the further development of such smart materials. Here we introduce a concept of Robo-Matter, which can be activated and controlled through external information exchange at the building block level, to enable a high-level of controllability, mutability and versatility for reconfigurable multifunctional smart materials. Using specially designed micro-robot building blocks with symmetry-breaking active motion modes, tunable anisotropic interactions, and interactive coupling with a programmable spatial-temporal dynamic light field, we demonstrate an emergent Robot-Matter duality, which enables a spectrum of desirable behaviors spanning from matter-like properties such as ultra-fast self-assembly and adaptivity, to robot-like properties including active force output, smart healing, smart morphing and infiltration.

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising cancer therapy; however, resistance frequently develops. To explore ICB resistance mechanisms, we develop Immunotherapy Resistance cell-cell Interaction Scanner (IRIS), a machine learning model aimed at identifying cell-type-specific tumor microenvironment ligand-receptor interactions relevant to ICB resistance. Applying IRIS to deconvolved transcriptomics data of the five largest melanoma ICB cohorts, we identify specific downregulated interactions, termed resistance downregulated interactions (RDI), as tumors develop resistance. These RDIs often involve chemokine signaling and offer a stronger predictive signal for ICB response compared to upregulated interactions or the state-of-the-art published transcriptomics biomarkers. Validation across multiple independent melanoma patient cohorts and modalities confirms that RDI activity is associated with CD8 + T cell infiltration and highly manifested in hot/brisk tumors.

 Autumn phenology plays a critical role in shaping the carbon sequestration capacity of temperate forests. Notable local-scale variations in autumn phenology have drawn increasing attention recently, potentially introducing substantial uncertainty when predicting temperate forest productivity. Yet the underpinning mechanisms driving these variations remain inadequately elucidated. Here we observed significant and consistent relationships between canopy structure and autumn phenology across six temperate forest sites, induced by the regulation effect of canopy structure on microclimate conditions. Incorporating the identified ‘canopy structure–microclimate–autumn phenology’ pathway into existing autumn phenology models significantly improves the prediction accuracy and reduces the projected delay in the start of autumn over the remainder of the century. These findings offer a new perspective for interpreting the local variations of autumn phenology in temperate forests and emphasize the urgent need to integrate the identified pathway into the Earth system and vegetation models, especially considering the asynchronous changes of macroclimate and microclimate conditions.

 The global mean surface temperature is widely studied to monitor climate change. A current debate centers around whether there has been a recent (post-1970s) surge/acceleration in the warming rate. Here we investigate whether an acceleration in the warming rate is detectable from a statistical perspective. We use changepoint models, which are statistical techniques specifically designed for identifying structural changes in time series. Four global mean surface temperature records over 1850–2023 are scrutinized within. Our results show limited evidence for a warming surge; in most surface temperature time series, no change in the warming rate beyond the 1970s is detected despite the breaking record temperatures observed in 2023. As such, we estimate the minimum changes in the warming trend required for a surge to be detectable. Across all datasets, an increase of at least 55% is needed for a warming surge to be detectable at the present time.

 The split-window (SW) and temperature-and-emissivity separation (TES) algorithms have been widely used for land surface temperature (LST) estimation from thermal infrared (TIR) observations for various missions. However, the SW algorithm requires prior estimates of land surface emissivity (LSE). The TES algorithm encompasses an atmospheric correction module, which increases the complexity and uncertainty of operational LST retrieval. To address this, we proposed a split-window-driven temperature-and-emissivity separation (SWDTES) algorithm in this study to estimate LST and LSE simultaneously without the need of atmospheric correction by combining the respective advantages of SW and TES. The inputs to the SWDTES algorithm are largely simplified, which only requires atmospheric water vapor content (AWVC) apart from the top-of-atmosphere TIR radiance. The developed SWDTES algorithm was applied to the high spatial resolution Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) data from the newly launched Sustainable Development Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) mission, and its performance was assessed using the MODIS data and ground measurements. The cross validation shows that the correlation coefficient (r), bias and root mean square error (RMSE) between MODIS-converted LSE and retrieved LSE using the SWDTES algorithm for the nighttime case is 0.904, −0.033 and 0.038 for band 1; 0.677, −0.008 and 0.014 for band 2; and 0.576, −0.000 and 0.008 for band 3, indicating a good consistency between the two LSE estimates. In addition, the evaluation using ground measurements shows that the r, bias and RMSE between the in-situ LST and retrieved LST using the SWDTES algorithm are 0.99, −0.67 K and 2.10 K, respectively. Compared to the OSW and TES algorithms, the SWDTES algorithm reduces the RMSE by 0.34 K and 0.90 K, respectively, indicating an improvement in LST retrieval accuracy. We conclude that the proposed SWDTES algorithm can achieve high-accuracy and high-resolution LST retrieval from the SDGSAT-1 mission, supporting fine-scale applications in energy, water, and carbon cycle modeling."

 The low-level jet (LLJ) and the urban heat island (UHI) are common nocturnal phenomena. While the UHI has been studied extensively, interactions of the LLJ and the urban atmosphere in general (and the UHI in particular) have received less attention. In the framework of the PANAME (PAris region urbaN Atmospheric observations and models for Multidisciplinary rEsearch) initiative in the Paris region, continuous profiles of horizontal wind speed and vertical velocity were recorded with two Doppler wind lidars (DWLs) – for the first time allowing for a detailed investigation of the summertime LLJ characteristics in the region. Jets are detected for 70 % of the examined nights, often simultaneously at an urban and a suburban site, highlighting the LLJ regional spatial extent. Emerging at around sunset, the mean LLJ duration is ∼ 10 h, the mean wind speed is 9 m s−1, and the average core height is 400 m above the city. The temporal evolution of many events shows signatures that indicate that the inertial oscillation mechanism plays a role in the jet development: a clockwise veering of the wind direction and a rapid acceleration followed by a slower deceleration. The horizontal wind shear below the LLJ core induces variance in the vertical velocity (σw2) above the urban canopy layer. It is shown that σw2 is a powerful predictor for regional contrast in air temperature, as the UHI intensity decreases exponentially with increasing σw2 and strong UHI values only occur when σw2 is very weak. This study demonstrates how DWL observations in cities provide valuable insights into near-surface processes relevant to human and environmental health."

We isolated 54 anaerobic and 32 aerobic bacteria from paddy soil with a high As methylation potential. Among the 86 isolates, 14 anaerobes, including 7 sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), but none of the aerobes were able to methylate arsenite [As(III)] or monomethylarsenite [MMA(III)] or both, suggesting that the As-methylating ability is much more prevalent in anaerobes than in aerobes. We performed a detailed investigation on As methylation by a SRB isolate, Solidesulfovibrio sp. TC1, and identified a novel bifunctional enzyme consisting of a fusion of As(III) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyltransferase (ArsM) and a radical SAM protein. The enzyme (ArsSM) can catalyze As(III) methylation to MMA and DMA and subsequent adenosylation of DMA to form 5′-deoxy-5′-dimethylarsinoyl-adenosine (DDMAA), which is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of arsenosugars. High concentrations of sulfide produced by SRB did not affect As(III) methylation to MMA but inhibited MMA methylation to DMA.

Given porous media opacity, knowledge is usually obtained indirectly by monitoring microplastic concentration in the effluent and measuring microplastic distribution after removing grains in layers. In this study, real-time visualization of infiltration and retention of microplastics in porous media under vertical water flow is performed using an improved reflective index matching method, considering the different shapes and densities of microplastics and size ratios between microplastics and grains. The spherical microplastics have the largest infiltration depths, with trajectories closest to vertical and accompanied by long acceleration durations and low deceleration frequencies. The cylindrical microplastics deviate from vertical and have stronger transverse oscillations and more frequent decelerations, while the flaky microplastics have the most significant transverse displacements. The infiltration depth can be improved by reducing the size ratio between microplastics and grains and increasing the vertical flow rate, while the density of microplastics has a relatively limited effect. Sliding and rotating of microplastics after collision with grains are observed, responsible for deceleration and transverse displacements. Different retention patterns are found, with the number of types being inversely proportional to the number of principal dimensions of the shape."

In this study, we found that more microbubbles stably adhered to the surface layer of anammox granular sludge (AnGS, Gs) operating under long-term sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) stress of 2 mg/L, compared to that in the control reactor (Gc). The difference in covering content can be up to over three times (1.0 ± 0.1% vs 0.3 ± 0.0%). Batch tests showed that the coverage ratio of microbubbles on Gs reached approximately 32.5%, which significantly reduced SMZ transfer into AnGS due to the adsorption of SMZ by bubbles, thus alleviating the inhibition of anammox bacterial activity by 36.5%. The adhesion force between the microbubbles and the surface layer of Gs was found to be largely enhanced by 75.0% compared to that of Gc. The increased hydrophobicity of surface layer due to the increased extracellular polymer substance (EPS, mainly proteins) content, and the larger capillary force of surface layer, owing to the unique micronano structure, were identified as key factors responsible for the stable adhesion of microbubbles on the Gs. Consequently, this study demonstrated the vital roles of the surface-adhered microbubbles in resisting the stress of SMZ and shed light on the regulation and development of robust granule-based anammox processes."

Such mineral transformations can be catalyzed by aqueous Fe(II) (Fe(II)aq) in redox-dynamic environments like coastal wetlands, which are inundated with seawater during storm surges or tidal events associated with sea-level rise. Yet, it is unknown how seawater salinity will impact Fe(II)-catalyzed ferrihydrite transformation or the fate of bound OC. We reacted ferrihydrite with Fe(II)aq under anoxic conditions in the absence and presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM). We compared treatments with no salts (DI water), NaCl–KCl salts, and artificial seawater mixes (containing Ca and Mg ions) with or without SO42–/HCO3–. Both XRD and Mössbauer showed that NaCl–KCl favored lepidocrocite formation, whereas Ca2+/Mg2+/SO42–/HCO3– ions in seawater overrode the effects of NaCl–KCl and facilitated goethite formation. We found that the highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds (HuPh) of DOM selectively bound to Fe minerals, promoting nanogoethite formation in seawater treatments. Regardless of salt presence, only 5–9% of Fe-bound OC was released during ferrihydrite transformation, enriching HuPh relative to aliphatics in solution. This study offers new insights into the occurrence of (nano)goethite and the role of Fe minerals in OC protection in coastal wetlands."

However, the lack of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity limits its application. Here, we propose a palladium–palladium oxide (Pd-PdO) heterostructure for efficient electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination of recalcitrant chlorophenols and selective formation of phenol with superior Pd-mass activity (1.35 min–1 mgPd–1), which is 4.4 times of commercial Pd/C and about 10–100 times of reported Pd-based catalysts. The Pd-PdO heterostructure is stable in real water matrices and achieves selective phenol recovery (>99%) from the chlorophenol mixture and efficient detoxification along chlorophenol removal. Experimental results and computational modeling reveal that the adsorption/desorption behaviors of zerovalent Pd and PdO sites in the Pd-PdO heterostructure are optimized and a synergy is realized to promote atomic hydrogen (H*) generation, transfer, and utilization: H* is efficiently generated at zerovalent Pd sites, transferred to PdO sites, and eventually consumed in the dechlorination reaction at PdO sites.

Our results showed that China generated a total of 13 (±0.9) Tg urban trapped P between 1992–2019. This amounts to 6 (±0.5) % of the total consumed P and 9 (±0.6) % of the chemical fertilizer P used in China over that period. The loss of cultivated land accounted for 15% of the trapped urban P, and half of this was concentrated in three provinces: Shandong, Henan, and Hebei. This is primarily since nearly one-third of the newly expanded urban areas are located within these provinces. The remaining 85% of trapped urban P was associated with urban solid waste disposal.

A large population of 0–165 Ma old zircons have coherent oxygen (δ18O 3.8–5.9‰) and hafnium (εHf(t)+3.5–+12.5) mantle isotopic signatures. These results are consistent with the crystallization of zircon from plume‐related melts. In addition, a chemically diverse population with ages from the Paleozoic to the Archean was found. These older populations are enigmatic but they could represent remnants of ancient subducted sediments. Meanwhile, the ∼0–165 Ma population is interpreted as plume‐derived, suggesting that the hotspot started at least ∼165 Ma ago. A spike of ∼164–160 Ma zircons could represent a Large Igneous Province (LIP) stage upon the first arrival of the plume. We use plate reconstructions to show that such a LIP would have formed on the Phoenix Plate and would have subducted below the Antarctic Peninsula around 100–105 Ma. There, LIP subduction would offer a solution for the enigmatic Palmer Land deformation event, previously proposed to result from a collision with an unknown indenter. The here‐reported “ghost” of a prolonged hotspot activity suggests that fragments of the Easter plume and of the ambient sub‐lithospheric mantle stored and re‐sampled zircon xenocrysts due to convective (re)circulation at the scale of the plume head. Our study demonstrates how zircon geochronology and geochemistry provide novel insights into global‐scale geodynamics, offering new perspectives on the dynamics of mantle plumes and hotspot activity."

Low‐level Jets (LLJs) play a critical role in triggering nocturnal rainfall in many areas on our planet.

The results show that inertial oscillations precede LLJ‐induced nocturnal rainfall. The typical northward propagation of LLJ is driven primarily by horizontal advection. Starting 48 min before rainfall, the BLJ nose rapidly strengthens and moves downward from 0.8 km above ground level (AGL), while the SLLJ nose moves upward to 2.4 km AGL.

Rather, we further demonstrate that the curvature‐based methodology effectively eliminates the shear influence to identify cyclonic and anticyclonic regions, which is dismissed in his argument.

 Virulent Klebsiella oxytoca strains are associated with gut and lung pathologies, yet our understanding of the molecular signals governing pathogenesis remains limited. Here, we characterized a family of K. oxytoca pyrazine and pyrazinone autoinducers and explored their roles in microbial and host signaling. We identified the human mucin capping sugar Neu5Ac as a selective elicitor of leupeptin, a protease inhibitor prevalent in clinical lung isolates of K. oxytoca, and leupeptin-derived pyrazinone biosynthesis. Additionally, we uncovered a separate pyrazine pathway, regulated by general carbohydrate metabolism, derived from a broadly conserved PLP-dependent enzyme. While both pyrazine and pyrazinone signaling induce iron acquisition responses, including enterobactin biosynthesis, pyrazinone signaling enhances yersiniabactin virulence factor production and selectively activates the proinflammatory human histamine receptor H4 (HRH4). Our findings suggest that the availability of specific carbohydrates delineates distinct autoinducer pathways in K. oxytoca that may have differential effects on bacterial virulence and host immune responses.

Here, the authors propose such a framework, and test it on a trapped-ion system measuring up to three-time correlation functions. 
 Measurement-induced state disturbance is a major challenge in obtaining quantum statistics at multiple time points. We propose a method to extract dynamic information from a quantum system at intermediate time points, namely snapshotting quantum dynamics. To this end, we apply classical post-processing after performing the ancilla-assisted measurements to cancel out the impact of the measurements at each time point. Based on this, we reconstruct a multi-time quasi-probability distribution (QPD) that correctly recovers the probability distributions at the respective time points. Our approach can also be applied to simultaneously extract exponentially many correlation functions with various time-orderings. We provide a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of the proposed protocol using a dual-species trapped-ion system by employing 171Yb+ and 138Ba+ ions as the system and the ancilla, respectively. Multi-time measurements are performed by repeated initialization and detection of the ancilla state without directly measuring the system state. The two- and three-time QPDs and correlation functions are reconstructed reliably from the experiment, negativity and complex values in the QPDs clearly indicate a contribution of the quantum coherence throughout dynamics. Sequential incompatible measurements on a quantum state would need a full multi-time generalisation of quasiprobability in order to be adequately described.

 We introduce generative models for accelerating simulations of high-dimensional systems through learning and evolving their effective dynamics. In the proposed Generative Learning of Effective Dynamics (G-LED), instances of high dimensional data are down sampled to a lower dimensional manifold that is evolved through an auto-regressive attention mechanism. In turn, Bayesian diffusion models, that map this low-dimensional manifold onto its corresponding high-dimensional space, operate on batches of physics correlated, time sequences of data and capture the statistics of the system dynamics. We demonstrate the capabilities and drawbacks of G-LED in simulations of several benchmark systems, including the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, two-dimensional high Reynolds number flow over a backward-facing step, and simulations of three-dimensional turbulent channel flow. The results demonstrate that generative learning offers new frontiers for the accurate forecasting of the statistical properties of high-dimensional systems at a reduced computational cost.

 Charge transfer between molecules lies at the heart of many chemical processes. Here, we focus on the ultrafast electron dynamics associated with the formation of charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) states following X-ray absorption in aqueous solutions of Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+ ions. To explore the formation of such states in the aqueous phase, liquid-jet photoemission spectroscopy is employed. Using the core-hole-clock method, based on Auger–Meitner (AM) decay upon 1s excitation or ionization of the respective ions, upper limits are estimated for the metal-atom electron delocalization times to the neighboring water molecules. These delocalization processes represent the first steps in the formation of hydrated electrons, which are determined to take place on a timescale ranging from several hundred attoseconds (as) below the 1s ionization threshold to only 20 as far above the 1s ionization threshold. The decrease in the delocalization times as a function of the photon energy is continuous. This indicates that the excited electrons remain in the vicinity of the studied ions even above the ionization threshold, i.e., metal-ion electronic resonances associated with the CTTS state manifolds are formed. The three studied isoelectronic ions exhibit quantitative differences in their electron energetics and delocalization times, which are linked to the character of the respective excited states.

 Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are employed as top cells of tandem cells to break through the theoretical limits of single-junction photovoltaic devices. However, WBG PSCs exhibit severe open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss with increasing bromine content. Herein, inhomogeneous halogen-phase distribution is pointed out to be the reason, which hinders efficient extraction of carriers. We thus propose to form homogeneous halogen-phase distribution to address the issue. With the help of density functional theory, we construct a double-layer structure (D-2P) based on 2-(9H-Carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid molecules to provide nucleation sites for perovskite crystallization. Homogeneous perovskite phase is achieved through bottom-up templated crystallization of halogen component. The efficient carrier extraction reduces the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, resulting in a high Voc of 1.32 V. As a result, D-2P-treated device (1.75 eV) achieves a record power conversion efficiency of 20.80% (certified 20.70%), which is the highest value reported for WBG (more than 1.74 eV) PSCs.

We find that increased drought and aridity have a significant impact on internal migration, particularly in the hyper-arid and arid areas of Southern Europe, South Asia, Africa and the Middle East and South America. Migration patterns are shaped by the wealth, agricultural dependency and urbanization of both origin and destination areas with migration responses being stronger in rural and predominantly agricultural areas.

Furthermore, age and education groups respond differently to climatic stress, highlighting distinct mobility patterns of population subgroups across different geographic contexts.

The South Pacific Ocean represents a vast region where limiting nutrients have so far been investigated with only a handful of experiments. Here we report the results of eleven nutrient addition bioassay experiments conducted across the South Pacific Ocean at ca. 30°S as part of the GEOTRACES GP21 expedition. Nitrogen addition alone stimulated chlorophyll-a accumulation at all sites, whilst increases were larger following supplementary addition of iron in the eastern and central basin, and phosphate in the western basin. Enhanced iron stress following nitrogen addition in the eastern and central basin further pointed towards ambient iron concentrations approaching co-limiting levels.

 Studies for the preservation of seagrass beds biotopes have met difficulties in establishing appropriate methods assessing their health. We tested the efficiency of space occupation by seagrasses scattered worldwide (dgrass index), which proved to be dependent on clonal growth form and morphometric plasticity. dgrass correlated with the above-ground to below-ground biomass ratio. However, the latter was misleading when high ratios resulted from low below-ground biomass. Nutrient Posphate-limitations were revealed in situations of theoretical Nitrogen-limitation. Enhanced nutrient supply benefitted seagrasses only up to a threshold after which it became detrimental. Better nurtured, healthier meadows with denser canopies increased the organic matter in the sediment and had associated greater abundances of benthic macrofauna. Hence, seagrass biotopes could benefit from moderate anthropogenic nutrient additions. However, organic matter above ≈6% and/or reduced riverine discharges (dams upstream and climate-change-related droughts) were detrimental to healthy meadows, jeopardizing ecosystem services such as macrofauna abundances and carbon sinks.

These vulnerabilities can be offset by quality housing and renewable energy installations. Energy hardship risks under moderate and high emissions global warming scenarios are projected to increase by 0.1%−2.6% and 0.6%−3.3% respectively in the long run. Energy hardship will remain a concern despite raising temperatures, especially for colder regions less prepared for heat and populations with individual vulnerabilities and lacking housing and neighbourhood adaptations. In Australia, the energy burden increases with extreme heat, and single-parent or lone-person households, residents living in poor-quality houses, and colder regions are at greater risk, according to an analysis of 269,500 observations of energy expense and temperature records from 2005 to 2021."

 Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention across various research domains due to their impressive performance, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), known for their exceptional accuracy in image processing tasks. However, the opaque nature of DNNs has raised concerns about their trustworthiness, as users often cannot understand how the model arrives at its predictions or decisions. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in critical fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where the stakes are high. Consequently, there has been a surge in the development of explanation methods for DNNs. Typically, the effectiveness of these methods is assessed subjectively via human observation on the heatmaps or attribution maps generated by eXplanation AI (XAI) methods. In this paper, a novel GeoStatistics Explainable Artificial Intelligence (GSEAI) framework is proposed, which integrates spatial pattern analysis from Geostatistics with XAI algorithms to assess and compare XAI understandability. Global and local Moran’s I indices, commonly used to assess the spatial autocorrelation of geographic data, assist in comprehending the spatial distribution patterns of attribution maps produced by the XAI method, through measuring the levels of aggregation or dispersion. Interpreting and analyzing attribution maps by Moran’s I scattergram and LISA clustering maps provide an accurate global objective quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution of feature attribution and achieves a more understandable local interpretation. In this paper, we conduct experiments on aircraft detection in SAR images based on the widely used YOLOv5 network, and evaluate four mainstream XAI methods quantitatively and qualitatively. By using GSEAI to perform explanation analysis of the given DNN, we could gain more insights about the behavior of the network, to enhance the trustworthiness of DNN applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time XAI has been integrated with geostatistical algorithms in SAR domain knowledge, which expands the analytical approaches of XAI and also promotes the development of XAI within SAR image analytics."

 Tropical savannas have a patchy vegetation structure and heterogeneous composition that complicates their mapping and management. Land managers need detailed vegetation information, especially as tropical savannas often support extensive ranching systems or wildlife-based tourism and face specific challenges such as bush thickening, drought, bushfires and, in Africa, browsing by large game. Since existing methods to map savanna vegetation mosaics rarely provide the resolution or speed required, this study aimed to characterise savanna vegetation with sufficient detail for management purposes and sufficient generalisation for the assessment of processes at a landscape level, using an easy, quick, and cost-efficient system. The study area is a semi-arid savanna in a small game reserve south of Etosha National Park in Namibia. A rapid field assessment focused on the woody vegetation and used the Bitterlich method. Indicator species analysis and MRPP tests resulted in five mixed woody vegetation classes. Random Forest was used to model vegetation composition, structure and woody cover. The highest accuracy was obtained for vegetation composition (77 %) and the lowest for vegetation cover (71 %) with similar accuracies at a resolution of 10 m compared to 30 m. The most important predictors were a radar mosaic (ALOS PALSAR HV) and Sentinel-2 data representing days in wet and dry seasons, with MSAVI2 a more suitable vegetation index than NDVI. Other predictors such as land surface temperature during winter nights, geology, and distance to water points contributed to the models. The final vegetation map contains 10 classes based on woody vegetation composition and structure. The most dominant classes were Colophospermum mopane – Terminalia prunioides woodland (33 %) and bushland (18 %) with grassland only covering 2.5 %. The method described here was driven by management requirements and can be used for bush control monitoring, quantifying the carbon pool and carrying capacity. It combines an old field survey method with free state-of-the-art datasets and algorithms. The focus on woody vegetation minimises the dependence on the intermittent presence of grasses and herbs in semi-arid savannas."

 This article provides a critical review of progress, challenges, emerging gaps as well as future recommendations on the remote sensing of grass quality during the senescence phenological stage. The study adopted a critical approach and analysed nineteen peer-reviewed articles which were retrieved from Scopus, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers using key search words. Overall, the results showed that remote sensing has been used to map the quality elements of senescent grass as determined by the concentration of macronutrients, fibre content and biochemical variables such as chlorophyll content. Successful estimation of these variables was achieved using ground-based, airborne, and spaceborne sensors. Nonetheless, this critical review demonstrates that the choice of suitable remote sensing sensor for mapping grass quality attributes during senescence depends on the trade-offs between sensing characteristics, spatial coverage, and data availability. Critical assessment of retrieved literature showed that wavebands located in the red, red-edge, and shortwave infrared regions had the highest sensitivity to senescent grass quality constituents. Remote sensing algorithms reported within the retrieved studies include multivariate analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms and radiative transfer models. Although these are associated with different performances in different settings and vary in their strengths and limitations, it is argued that there is no specific algorithm that is suitable for a specific variable in the context of characterizing grass quality during the senescence period. In this regard, there is a need to assess and ascertain based on factors such as sample size and number of explanatory variables used which affect their accuracy. It is concluded that despite the noted progress in sensor capabilities, the new generation of space borne hyperspectral sensors such as Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program provides untapped prospects to advance the scientific inquiry for remote sensing grass quality during the senescence stage. The review therefore recommends that further research in this field can also consider the utility of such sensor systems, which are readily accessible to enhance the discreet detection of grass quality attributes over space and time. Precise detection of subtle changes in grass nutritional quality during the senescence phenological stage is essential for monitoring forage provisioning ecosystem services."

 Understanding the rapid intensification (RI) of Hurricane Wilma (2005) in terms of the maximum wind has been carried out in a series of papers, this study examines the gradient wind balance and imbalance during RI, based on a 72-h Wilma prediction conducted using the Weather Research Forecast Model (WRF) with the 1-km grid resolution. Results show that the pressure gradient force (PGF) near the eyewall increases rapidly during the RI period. The maximum PGF associated with the gradient wind balance is determined by the strong radial gradient of the thermal field near the eyewall, resulting from the warming in the eye and adiabatic cooling near the eyewall. The maximum PGF occurs inside the radius of the maximum wind, causing a convergence region and intense updrafts, which favors RI. In a balanced symmetric framework, the hydrostatic PGF accounts for a major fraction (70 %–90 %) of the predicted PGF, and the secondary circulation is underestimated by the Sawyer-Eliassen equation within the boundary layer, at upper levels and through the intense eyewall updrafts where gradient wind imbalance occurs. The unbalanced force accelerates the boundary-layer radial inflow that contributes to the inward contraction of the eyewall and then enhances the radially inward advection of high absolute angular momentum. The eyewall convection strengthens where the boundary-layer inflows, convergence, and heat and moisture flux are collocated. With the high inertial stability, a sufficient conversion efficiency from energy to kinematic energy favors the RI of Wilma."

Our results highlight that simultaneous reductions in methane emissions help avoid offsetting the air pollution benefits already achieved by the already-approved precursor emission reductions by 2050 in the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme region, while also playing an important role in bringing air pollution further down towards World Health Organization guideline limits. 
 The impacts of future methane (CH4) and other precursor emission changes are investigated for surface ozone (O3) in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) region excluding North America and Israel (the EMEP region, for European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) for the year 2050. The analysis includes a current legislation (CLE) and maximum feasible technical reduction (MFR) scenario, as well as a scenario that combines MFRs with an additional dietary shift that also meets the Paris Agreement objectives with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (LOW). For each scenario, background CH4 concentrations are calculated using a probabilistic Earth system model emulator and combined with other precursor emissions in a three-dimensional Eulerian chemistry-transport model. While focus is placed on peak season maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations, a range of other indicators for health and vegetation impacts are also discussed. Our analysis shows that roughly one-third of the total peak season MDA8 reduction achieved between the 2050 CLE and MFR scenarios is attributable to CH4 reductions, resulting predominantly from CH4 emission reductions outside of the EMEP region. The impact of other precursor emission reductions is split nearly evenly between the reductions inside and outside of the EMEP region. However, the relative importance of CH4 and other precursor emission reductions is shown to depend on the choice of O3 indicator, though indicators sensitive to peak O3 show generally consistent results. The analysis also highlights the synergistic impacts of CH4 mitigation as reducing solely CH4 achieves, beyond air quality improvement, nearly two-thirds of the total global warming reduction calculated for the LOW scenario compared to the CLE case."

Our new software, PPCon, uses ocean data to predict key factors like nitrate and chlorophyll levels, which are hard to measure directly. By leveraging machine learning, PPCon offers more accurate and efficient predictions. 
 Effective observation of the ocean is vital for studying and assessing the state and evolution of the marine ecosystem and for evaluating the impact of human activities. However, obtaining comprehensive oceanic measurements across temporal and spatial scales and for different biogeochemical variables remains challenging. Autonomous oceanographic instruments, such as Biogeochemical (BGC)-Argo profiling floats, have helped expand our ability to obtain subsurface and deep-ocean measurements, but measuring biogeochemical variables, such as nutrient concentration, still remains more demanding and expensive than measuring physical variables. Therefore, developing methods to estimate marine biogeochemical variables from high-frequency measurements is very much needed. Current neural network (NN) models developed for this task are based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, trained over point-wise pairs of input–output features. Although MLPs can produce smooth outputs if the inputs change smoothly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently designed to handle profile data effectively. In this study, we present a novel one-dimensional (1D) CNN model to predict profiles leveraging the typical shape of vertical profiles of a variable as a prior constraint during training. In particular, the Predict Profiles Convolutional (PPCon) model predicts nitrate, chlorophyll, and backscattering (bbp700) starting from the date and geolocation and from temperature, salinity, and oxygen profiles. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using a robust BGC-Argo dataset collected in the Mediterranean Sea for training and validation.

 Process-based ecosystem models are increasingly important for predicting forest dynamics under future environmental conditions, which may encompass non-analogous climate coupled with unprecedented disturbance regimes. However, challenges persist due to the extensive number of model parameters, scarce calibration data, and trade-offs between the local precision and the applicability of the model over a wide range of environmental conditions. In this paper, we describe a protocol that allows a modeller to collect transferable ecosystem properties based on ecosystem characteristic criteria and to compile the parameters that need to be described in the field.We applied the procedure to develop a new parameterisation for European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) for the Biome-BGCMuSo model, the most advanced member of the Biome-BGC family. For model calibration and testing, we utilised multiyear forest carbon data from 87 plots distributed across five European countries. The initial values of 48 new ecophysiological parameters were defined based on a literature review. The final values of six calibrated parameters were optimised for single sites as well as for multiple sites using generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and model output conditioning that ensured plausible simulations based on user-defined ranges of carbon stock output variables (carbon stock in aboveground wood biomass, soil, and litter) and finding the intersections of site-specific plausible parameter hyperspaces. To support the model use, we tested the model performance by simulating aboveground tree wood, soil, and litter carbon across a large geographical gradient of central Europe and evaluated the trade-offs between parameters tailored to single plots and parameters estimated using multiple sites.Our findings indicated that parameter sets derived from single sites provided an improved local accuracy of simulations of aboveground wood, soil, and litter carbon stocks by 35 %, 55 %, and 11 % in comparison to the a priori parameter set. However, their broader applicability was very limited. A multi-site optimised parameter set, on the other hand, performed satisfactorily across the entire geographical domain studied here, including on sites not involved in the parameter estimation, but the errors were, on average, 26 %, 35 % and 9 % greater for the aboveground wood, soil, and litter carbon stocks than those obtained with the site-specific parameter sets. Importantly, model simulations demonstrated plausible responses across large-scale environmental gradients, featuring a clear production optimum of beech that aligns with empirical studies. These findings suggest that the model is capable of accurately simulating the dynamics of European beech across its range and can be used for more comprehensive experimentations."

It builds on the LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 and 8.1 papers published in GMD: whereas LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 focussed on GPU-parallelisation, and LISFLOOD-FP 8.1 focussed on static mesh adaptivity of (multi)wavelets, LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 combines GPU-parallelisation with multiwavelet dynamic mesh adaptivity to drastically reduce simulation runtimes, achieving up to a 4.5-fold speedup. 
 The second-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) solver of the shallow water equations in LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 is well-suited for predicting small-scale transients that emerge in rapid, multiscale floods caused by impact events like tsunamis. However, this DG2 solver can only be used for simulations on a uniform grid where it may yield inefficient runtimes even when using its graphics processing unit (GPU) parallelised version (GPU-DG2). To maximise runtime reduction, the LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 version integrates GPU parallelised dynamic (in time) grid resolution adaptivity of multiwavelets (MW) with the DG2 solver (GPU-MWDG2). The GPU-MWDG2 solver requires selecting a maximum refinement level, L, based on size and resolution of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and an error threshold, ε ≤ 10-3, to preserve similar accuracy as a GPU-DG2 simulation on a uniform grid. The accuracy and efficiency of dynamic GPU-MWDG2 adaptivity is assessed for four tsunami-induced flooding test cases involving increasingly complex tsunamis: from single-wave impact events to wave trains. At ε = 10-3, the GPU-MWDG2 simulations yield predictions similar to the GPU-DG2 simulations but using ε = 10-4 can improve the accuracy in velocity-related predictions. In terms of efficiency, the GPU-MWDG2 simulations show progressively larger speedups over the GPU-DG2 simulations from L ≥ 10, which become significant (≥ 3.3- and 4.5-fold at ε = 10-4 and 10-3 , respectively) for simulating a single-wave impact event.

However, the effects of adsorption and complexation on Cd isotope fractionation during the rhizosphere processes remain unclear. Here, we cultivated the Cd hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii and Cd-tolerance Sedum spectabile in three different soils with citric acid applied as a degradable rhizosphere biostimulant. Cellular elemental distributions in the tissues and Cd isotope compositions were determined through NanoSIMS and MC-ICP-MS, respectively. Cd precipitation/adsorption on cell walls and intracellular regional distribution were the main mechanisms of Cd tolerance in S. spectabile. Plant roots became enriched with heavier Cd isotopes relative to the surrounding soils upon increasing secretion of rhizosphere organic acids. This indicates that organic matter with O and N functional groups preferentially chelates heavy Cd isotopes. In addition, Cd isotope fractionation between roots and shoots varies within the three soils, which could be due to the influence of protein and metallothionein contents in roots and leaves. The finding indicates that sulfur-containing ligands preferentially chelate light Cd isotopes.

Here, we report paired PFAS measurements in water, sediment, and aquatic biota along a hydrological gradient away from source zones contaminated by the use of legacy aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) manufactured using electrochemical fluorination. Clustering analysis indicates that the PFAS composition characteristic of AFFF is detectable in water and fishes >8 km from the source. Concentrations of 38 targeted PFAS and extractable organofluorine (EOF) decreased in fishes downgradient of the AFFF-contaminated source zones. However, PFAS concentrations remained above consumption limits at all locations within the affected watershed. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide precursors accounted for approximately half of targeted PFAS in fish tissues, which explain >90% of EOF across all sampling locations. Suspect screening analyses revealed the presence of a polyfluoroketone pharmaceutical in fish species, and a fluorinated agrochemical in water that likely does not accumulate in biological tissues, suggesting the presence of diffuse sources such as septic system and agrochemical inputs throughout the watershed in addition to AFFF contamination.

The investigation revealed that single metabolites ANA-B and CYL exhibited the highest potency in immobilizing the larvae. Notably, the binary mixture AER-B+CYL induced a remarkably strong synergistic interaction, while other tested binary and ternary mixtures demonstrated antagonistic effects. Both individual metabolites and their mixtures led to a decrease in larval movement speed, with the AER-B+CYL combination showing a very synergistic effect, and strong antagonistic interactions between the oligopeptides in the ternary mixture. Conversely, while AER-B and the binary mixture ANA-B+CYL stimulated vertical movement, other single metabolites and binary and ternary mixtures decreased this parameter. Antagonistic interactions were observed in all mixtures. ANA-B emerged as the most potent inhibitor, yet all tested metabolites and their mixtures decreased larval response to light, displaying synergistic interactions, except for the AER-B+ANA-B mixture at 250 μg L–1 + 250 μg L–1.

Recent studies found that Fe(II) can oxidize As(III), but the extent of oxidation with mixed-valent iron minerals and the mechanisms involved are unknown. In this study, we investigated whether As(III) can be oxidized under reducing conditions using green rust sulfate (GR-SO4), an Fe mineral containing both Fe(II) and Fe(III). Batch sorption experiments showed that GR-SO4 (1 g L–1) effectively sorbs environmentally relevant concentrations of As(III) (50–500 μg L–1) under anoxic, neutral pH conditions with and without citrate (50 μM). X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy analysis at the As K-edge demonstrated that approximately 76% of As(III) was oxidized to As(V) by GR-SO4. Complete oxidation of As(III) was observed in the presence of citrate. As(III) oxidation can be linked to the phase transformation of GR-SO4 to goethite, resulting in new reactive Fe(III) species that plausibly drive oxidation. Citrate enhanced this process by stabilizing Fe on the mixed GR-SO4/goethite surface, preventing its reduction back to Fe(II) and facilitating further As(III) oxidation without significant Fe loss to the solution. This study highlights the cryptic As(III) oxidation that occurs under reducing conditions, providing new insights into the cycling of arsenic in mixed phases of iron-rich, anoxic environments."

Gas extraction from the Groningen gas field resulted in significant induced seismicity. We analyze the magnitude‐frequency distribution of these earthquakes in space, time and in view of stress changes calculated based on gas production and reservoir properties. Previous studies suggested variations related to reservoir geometry and stress. While we confirm the spatial variations, we do not detect a clear sensitivity of b‐value to Coulomb stress changes. However, we find that b‐value correlates positively with the rate of Coulomb stress changes. This correlation is statistically significant and robust to uncertainties related to stress change calculation.

K‐changes are observed as step‐like increases in the thundercloud electric fields. The K‐changes occur in the late part of intra‐cloud lightning or during negative cloud‐to‐ground lightning between return strokes. It has been shown that the processes leading to K‐changes initiate in the decayed part of a positive leader channel and propagate toward the flash origin. They are often accompanied by microsecond‐scale electric field pulses. We introduce a new model to simulate processes leading to the K‐changes in cloud‐to‐ground lightning. Our method is based on the full solution of Maxwell's equations coupled to Poisson's equation for the thundercloud charge structure. To model the K‐changes, we gradually increase the decayed channel conductivity. The modeled current wavefront propagates due to the K‐processes downward along a vertical channel and completely attenuates before reaching the ground. We derive the evolution of the linear charge densities and the scalar electric potential along the channel leading to K‐changes. We model electrostatic step‐like changes in the measured electric field together with the approximate rates and amplitudes of the microsecond scale pulses. Step‐like changes increase their amplitudes with the length of the simulated channel and with a higher conductivity of the channel. The microsecond‐scale pulse waveshapes depend mainly on the propagation velocity of the current wave, and the time scale of the conductivity increase.

Recent studies have suggested that drought projections using Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and standardized evapotranspiration precipitation index (SPEI) may overestimate drought severity. This overestimation occurs because the potential evapotranspiration (PET) calculations fail to consider the interactive effects of vegetation responses such as increased leaf area index (LAI) and constrained stomatal conductance, which are influenced by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]). To address this issue, our study replaced the traditional Penman‐Monteith (PM) equation with a recently proposed PET equation that includes the effects of changing [CO2] and LAI to assess droughts at monthly scale in the Upper Yangtze River basin, which experiences the vegetation greening. The findings indicated a consistent increasing trend in drought conditions with minimal discrepancy between the two equations over the historical period (1986–2017). This consistency arises because the water‐saving effects of increased [CO2] and the greening effects of rising LAI largely counterbalance each other. However, for the future period (2018–2100), projections using PM equation predicted an intensification of drought conditions. In contrast, the improved SPEI indicated no significant drought variations, and the improved PDSI suggested a wetting trend. This divergence can be attributed to the water‐saving effects increasingly outweighing the greening effects, as PET shows a decreasing sensitivity to LAI with LAI increasing, but maintains a near‐constant sensitivity to elevated [CO2]. Consequently, the indices based on PM equation tend to overestimate future drought severity. Overall, this study demonstrates that the new PET estimation method is more capable of responding to the changing environment."

 Eukaryotic innate immune systems use pattern recognition receptors to sense infection by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which then triggers an immune response. Bacteria have similarly evolved immunity proteins that sense certain components of their viral predators, known as bacteriophages1–6. Although different immunity proteins can recognize different phage-encoded triggers, individual bacterial immunity proteins have been found to sense only a single trigger during infection, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between bacterial pattern recognition receptors and their ligands7–11. Here we demonstrate that the antiphage defence protein CapRelSJ46 in Escherichia coli can directly bind and sense two completely unrelated and structurally different proteins using the same sensory domain, with overlapping but distinct interfaces. Our results highlight the notable versatility of an immune sensory domain, which may be a common property of antiphage defence systems that enables them to keep pace with their rapidly evolving viral predators. We found that Bas11 phages harbour both trigger proteins that are sensed by CapRelSJ46 during infection, and we demonstrate that such phages can fully evade CapRelSJ46 defence only when both triggers are mutated. Our work shows how a bacterial immune system that senses more than one trigger can help prevent phages from easily escaping detection, and it may allow the detection of a broader range of phages. More generally, our findings illustrate unexpected multifactorial sensing by bacterial defence systems and complex coevolutionary relationships between them and their phage-encoded triggers.

 Mechanical metamaterials exhibit interesting properties such as high stiffness at low density1–3, enhanced energy absorption3,4, shape morphing5–7, sequential deformations8–11, auxeticity12–14 and robust waveguiding15,16. Until now, metamaterial design has primarily relied on geometry, and materials nonlinearities such as viscoelasticity, fracture and plasticity have been largely left out of the design rationale. In fact, plastic deformations have been traditionally seen as a failure mode and thereby carefully avoided1,3,17,18. Here we embrace plasticity instead and discover a delicate balance between plasticity and buckling instability, which we term ‘yield buckling’. We exploit yield buckling to design metamaterials that buckle sequentially in an arbitrary large sequence of steps whilst keeping a load-bearing capacity. We make use of sequential yield buckling to create metamaterials that combine stiffness and dissipation—two properties that are usually incompatible—and that can be used several times. Hence, our metamaterials exhibit superior shock-absorption performance.

 Helicobacter pylori disturbs the stomach lining during long-term colonization of its human host, with sequelae including ulcers and gastric cancer1,2. Numerous H. pylori virulence factors have been identified, showing extensive geographic variation1. Here we identify a ‘Hardy’ ecospecies of H. pylori that shares the ancestry of ‘Ubiquitous’ H. pylori from the same region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in 100 genes, many of which encode outer membrane proteins and host interaction factors. Most Hardy strains have a second urease, which uses iron as a cofactor rather than nickel3, and two additional copies of the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA. Hardy strains currently have a limited distribution, including in Indigenous populations in Siberia and the Americas and in lineages that have jumped from humans to other mammals. Analysis of polymorphism data implies that Hardy and Ubiquitous coexisted in the stomachs of modern humans since before we left Africa and that both were dispersed around the world by our migrations. Our results also show that highly distinct adaptive strategies can arise and be maintained stably within bacterial populations, even in the presence of continuous genetic exchange between strains. ‘Hardy’ Helicobacter pylori ecospecies shares the ancestry of ‘Ubiquitous’ H. pylori from the same region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in 100 genes."

 Understanding the origin of bright shooting stars and their meteorite samples is among the most ancient of astronomy-related questions, which at larger scales has human consequences1–3. As of today, only approximately 6% of meteorite falls have been firmly linked to their sources (Moon, Mars or asteroid (4) Vesta4–6). Here we show that approximately 70% of meteorites originate from three recent break-ups of D > 30 km asteroids that occurred 5.8, 7.6 and less than about 40 Myr ago. These break-ups, including the well-known Karin family7, took place in the prominent yet old Koronis and Massalia families and are at the origin of the dominance of H and L ordinary chondrites among meteorite falls. These young families are distinguished among all main belt asteroids by having a uniquely high abundance of small fragments. Their size–frequency distribution remained steep for a few tens of millions of years, exceeding temporarily the production of metre-sized fragments by the largest old asteroid families (for example, Flora and Vesta).

 The prevailing dogma for morphological patterning in developing organisms argues that the combined inputs of transcription factor networks and signalling morphogens alone generate spatially and temporally distinct expression patterns. However, metabolism has also emerged as a critical developmental regulator1–10, independent of its functions in energy production and growth. The mechanistic role of nutrient utilization in instructing cellular programmes to shape the in vivo developing mammalian embryo remains unknown. Here we reveal two spatially resolved, cell-type- and stage-specific waves of glucose metabolism during mammalian gastrulation by using single-cell-resolution quantitative imaging of developing mouse embryos, stem cell models and embryo-derived tissue explants. We identify that the first spatiotemporal wave of glucose metabolism occurs through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to drive fate acquisition in the epiblast, and the second wave uses glycolysis to guide mesoderm migration and lateral expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that glucose exerts its influence on these developmental processes through cellular signalling pathways, with distinct mechanisms connecting glucose with the ERK activity in each wave. Our findings underscore that—in synergy with genetic mechanisms and morphogenic gradients—compartmentalized cellular metabolism is integral in guiding cell fate and specialized functions during development.

 The balance between T helper type 1 (TH1) cells and other TH cells is critical for antiviral and anti-tumour responses1–3, but how this balance is achieved remains poorly understood. Here we dissected the dynamic regulation of TH1 cell differentiation during in vitro polarization, and during in vivo differentiation after acute viral infection. We identified regulators modulating T helper cell differentiation using a unique TH1–TH2 cell dichotomous culture system and systematically validated their regulatory functions through multiple in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screens. We found that RAMP3, a component of the receptor for the neuropeptide CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), has a cell-intrinsic role in TH1 cell fate determination. Extracellular CGRP signalling through the receptor RAMP3–CALCRL restricted the differentiation of TH2 cells, but promoted TH1 cell differentiation through the activation of downstream cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). ATF3 promoted TH1 cell differentiation by inducing the expression of Stat1, a key regulator of TH1 cell differentiation. After viral infection, an interaction between CGRP produced by neurons and RAMP3 expressed on T cells enhanced the anti-viral IFNγ-producing TH1 and CD8+ T cell response, and timely control of acute viral infection. Our research identifies a neuroimmune circuit in which neurons participate in T cell fate determination by producing the neuropeptide CGRP during acute viral infection, which acts on RAMP3-expressing T cells to induce an effective anti-viral TH1 cell response.

 Extreme ocean temperature events are becoming increasingly common due to global warming, causing catastrophic ecological and socioeconomic impacts1–5. Despite extensive research on surface marine heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold spells (MCSs) based on satellite observations6,7, our knowledge of these extreme events and their drivers in the subsurface ocean—home to the majority of marine organisms—is very limited8,9.

We found that 80% of measured MHWs and MCSs below a depth of 100 m do not concur with surface events. In contrast to the weak link between surface MHWs (MCSs) and ocean eddies, nearly one-third of subsurface MHWs (MCSs) in the global ocean, and more than half of such events in subtropical gyres and mid-latitude main current systems, occur within anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies.

 Many organisms, including cosmopolitan drosophilids, show circadian plasticity, varying their activity with changing dawn–dusk intervals1. How this behaviour evolves is unclear. Here we compare Drosophila melanogaster with Drosophila sechellia, an equatorial, ecological specialist that experiences minimal photoperiod variation, to investigate the mechanistic basis of circadian plasticity evolution2. D. sechellia has lost the ability to delay its evening activity peak time under long photoperiods. Screening of circadian mutants in D. melanogaster/D. sechellia hybrids identifies a contribution of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf) to this loss. Pdf exhibits species-specific temporal expression, due in part to cis-regulatory divergence. RNA interference and rescue experiments in D. melanogaster using species-specific Pdf regulatory sequences demonstrate that modulation of this neuropeptide’s expression affects the degree of behavioural plasticity. The Pdf regulatory region exhibits signals of selection in D. sechellia and across populations of D. melanogaster from different latitudes. We provide evidence that plasticity confers a selective advantage for D. melanogaster at elevated latitude, whereas D. sechellia probably suffers fitness costs through reduced copulation success outside its range. Our findings highlight this neuropeptide gene as a hotspot locus for circadian plasticity evolution that might have contributed to both D. melanogaster’s global distribution and D. sechellia’s specialization.

 The risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) constitutes the main challenge associated with insulin therapy for diabetes1,2. Insulin doses must be adjusted to ensure that blood glucose values are within the normal range, but matching insulin doses to fluctuating glucose levels is difficult because even a slightly higher insulin dose than needed can lead to a hypoglycaemic incidence, which can be anything from uncomfortable to life-threatening. It has therefore been a long-standing goal to engineer a glucose-sensitive insulin that can auto-adjust its bioactivity in a reversible manner according to ambient glucose levels to ultimately achieve better glycaemic control while lowering the risk of hypoglycaemia3. Here we report the design and properties of NNC2215, an insulin conjugate with bioactivity that is reversibly responsive to a glucose range relevant for diabetes, as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. NNC2215 was engineered by conjugating a glucose-binding macrocycle4 and a glucoside to insulin, thereby introducing a switch that can open and close in response to glucose and thereby equilibrate insulin between active and less-active conformations. The insulin receptor affinity for NNC2215 increased 3.2-fold when the glucose concentration was increased from 3 to 20 mM. In animal studies, the glucose-sensitive bioactivity of NNC2215 was demonstrated to lead to protection against hypoglycaemia while partially covering glucose excursions. NNC2215 is an insulin conjugate that can reversibly adjust its bioactivity in response to a diabetes-relevant glucose range in vivo."

 Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a fatal drug-induced skin reaction triggered by common medications and is an emerging public health issue1–3. Patients with TEN undergo severe and sudden epidermal detachment caused by keratinocyte cell death. Although molecular mechanisms that drive keratinocyte cell death have been proposed, the main drivers remain unknown, and there is no effective therapy for TEN4–6. Here, to systematically map molecular changes that are associated with TEN and identify potential druggable targets, we utilized deep visual proteomics, which provides single-cell-based, cell-type-resolution proteomics7,8. We analysed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived skin tissue biopsies of three types of cutaneous drug reactions with varying severity and quantified more than 5,000 proteins in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating immune cells. This revealed a marked enrichment of type I and type II interferon signatures in the immune cell and keratinocyte compartment of patients with TEN, as well as phosphorylated STAT1 activation. Targeted inhibition with the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in vitro reduced keratinocyte-directed cytotoxicity. In vivo oral administration of tofacitinib, baricitinib or the JAK1-specific inhibitors abrocitinib or upadacitinib ameliorated clinical and histological disease severity in two distinct mouse models of TEN. Crucially, treatment with JAK inhibitors (JAKi) was safe and associated with rapid cutaneous re-epithelialization and recovery in seven patients with TEN. This study uncovers the JAK/STAT and interferon signalling pathways as key pathogenic drivers of TEN and demonstrates the potential of targeted JAKi as a curative therapy.

 Neural coding has traditionally been examined through changes in firing rates and latencies in response to different stimuli1–5. However, populations of neurons can also exhibit transient bursts of spiking activity, wherein neurons fire in a specific temporal order or sequence6–8. The human brain may utilize these neuronal sequences within population bursts to efficiently represent information9–12, thereby complementing the well-known neural code based on spike rate or latency. Here we examined this possibility by recording the spiking activity of populations of single units in the human anterior temporal lobe as eight participants performed a visual categorization task. We find that population spiking activity organizes into bursts during the task. The temporal order of spiking across the activated units within each burst varies across stimulus categories, creating unique stereotypical sequences for individual categories as well as for individual exemplars within a category. The information conveyed by the temporal order of spiking activity is separable from and complements the information conveyed by the units’ spike rates or latencies following stimulus onset. Collectively, our data provide evidence that the human brain contains a complementary code based on the neuronal sequence within bursts of population spiking to represent information. The temporal order of neuronal firing within bursts of population spiking in the human anterior temporal lobe is dependent on the category as well as the identity of the individual stimulus, and this encodes information independently of spike rate or latency."

 The taste system controls many insect behaviours, yet little is known about how tastants are encoded in mosquitoes or how they regulate critical behaviours. Here we examine how taste stimuli are encoded by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes—a highly invasive disease vector—and how these cues influence biting, feeding and egg laying. We find that neurons of the labellum, the major taste organ of the head, differentially encode a wide variety of human and other cues. We identify three functional classes of taste sensilla with an expansive coding capacity. In addition to excitatory responses, we identify prevalent inhibitory responses, which are predictive of biting behaviour. Certain bitter compounds suppress physiological and behavioural responses to sugar, suggesting their use as potent stop signals against appetitive cues. Complex cues, including human sweat, nectar and egg-laying site water, elicit distinct response profiles from the neuronal repertoire. We identify key tastants on human skin and in sweat that synergistically promote biting behaviours. Transcriptomic profiling identifies taste receptors that could be targeted to disrupt behaviours. Our study sheds light on key features of the taste system that suggest new ways of manipulating chemosensory function and controlling mosquito vectors.

 Human prenatal skin is populated by innate immune cells, including macrophages, but whether they act solely in immunity or have additional functions in morphogenesis is unclear. Here we assembled a comprehensive multi-omics reference atlas of prenatal human skin (7–17 post-conception weeks), combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, to characterize the microanatomical tissue niches of the skin. This atlas revealed that crosstalk between non-immune and immune cells underpins the formation of hair follicles, is implicated in scarless wound healing and is crucial for skin angiogenesis. We systematically compared a hair-bearing skin organoid (SkO) model derived from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells to prenatal and adult skin1. The SkO model closely recapitulated in vivo skin epidermal and dermal cell types during hair follicle development and expression of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of genetic hair and skin disorders. However, the SkO model lacked immune cells and had markedly reduced endothelial cell heterogeneity and quantity. Our in vivo prenatal skin cell atlas indicated that macrophages and macrophage-derived growth factors have a role in driving endothelial development. Indeed, vascular network remodelling was enhanced following transfer of autologous macrophages derived from induced pluripotent stem cells into SkO cultures. Innate immune cells are therefore key players in skin morphogenesis beyond their conventional role in immunity, a function they achieve through crosstalk with non-immune cells. A comprehensive multi-omics reference atlas of prenatal human skin shows that innate immune cells crosstalk with non-immune cells to perform pivotal roles in skin morphogenesis, including the formation of hair follicles."

 Studies of micrometeorites in mid-Ordovician limestones and impact craters on Earth indicate that our planet witnessed a massive infall of ordinary L chondrite material about 466 million years ago1–3 that may have been at the origin of an Ordovician ice age and major turnover in biodiversity4. The breakup of a large asteroid in the main belt is the likely cause of this massive infall. Currently, material originating from this breakup still dominates meteorite falls (>20% of all falls)5. Here we provide spectroscopic observations and dynamical evidence that the Massalia collisional family is the only plausible source of this catastrophic event and the most abundant class of meteorites falling on Earth today.

 A key concept proposed by Landau to explain superfluid liquid helium is the elementary excitation of quantum particles called rotons1–8. The irregular arrangement of atoms in a liquid leads to the aperiodic dispersion of rotons, which played a pivotal role in understanding fractional quantum Hall liquids (magneto-rotons)9,10 and the supersolidity of Bose–Einstein condensates11–13. Even for a two-dimensional electron or dipole liquid, in the absence of a magnetic field, the repulsive interactions have been predicted to form a roton minimum14–19, which can be used to trace the transition to Wigner crystals20–24 and superconductivity25–27, although this has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of such electronic rotons in a two-dimensional dipole liquid of alkali-metal ions donating electrons to surface layers of black phosphorus. Our data reveal the striking aperiodic dispersion of rotons, which is characterized by a local minimum of energy at finite momentum. As the density of dipoles decreases so that interactions dominate over the kinetic energy, the roton gap reduces to 0, as in a crystal, signalling Wigner crystallization. Our model shows the importance of short-range order arising from repulsion between dipoles, which can be viewed as the formation of Wigner crystallites (bubbles or stripes) floating in the sea of a Fermi liquid. Our results reveal that the primary origin of electronic rotons (and the pseudogap) is strong correlations.

 Oil has long been the dominant feedstock for producing fuels and chemicals, but coal, natural gas and biomass are increasingly explored alternatives1–3. Their conversion first generates syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, which is then processed further using Fischer–Tropsch (FT) chemistry. However, although commercial FT technology for fuel production is established, using it to access valuable chemicals remains challenging. A case in point is linear α-olefins (LAOs), which are important chemical intermediates obtained by ethylene oligomerization at present4–8. The commercial high-temperature FT process and the FT-to-olefin process under development at present both convert syngas directly to LAOs, but also generate much CO2 waste that leads to a low carbon utilization efficiency9–14. The efficiency is further compromised by substantially fewer of the converted carbon atoms ending up as valuable C5–C10 LAOs than are found in the C2–C4 olefins that dominate the product mixtures9–14. Here we show that the use of the original phase-pure χ-iron carbide can minimize these syngas conversion problems: tailored and optimized for the process of FT to LAOs, this catalyst exhibits an activity at 290 °C that is 1–2 orders higher than dedicated FT-to-olefin catalysts can achieve above 320 °C (refs. 12–15), is stable for 200 h, and produces desired C2–C10 LAOs and unwanted CO2 with carbon-based selectivities of 51% and 9% under industrially relevant conditions. This higher catalytic performance, persisting over a wide temperature range (250–320 °C), demonstrates the potential of the system for developing a practically relevant technology.

 The Tesla valve benefits the rectification of fluid flow in microfluidic systems1–6 and inspires researchers to design modern solid-state electronic and thermal rectifiers referring to fluid-rectification mechanisms in a liquid-state context. In contrast to the rectification of fluids in microfluidic channels, the rectification of thermal phonons in micro-solid channels presents increased complexity owing to the lack of momentum-conserving collisions between phonons and the infrequent occurrence of liquid-like phonon flows. Recently, investigations and revelations of phonon hydrodynamics in graphitic materials7–10 have opened up new avenues for achieving thermal rectification.

 Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N) deposition affect plant communities in numerous ways1–11. Nitrogen deposition causes local biodiversity loss globally12–14, but whether, and if so how, rising CO2 concentrations amplify or dampen those losses remains unclear and is almost entirely unstudied. We addressed this knowledge gap with an open-air experiment in which 108 grassland plots were grown for 24 years under different CO2 and N regimes. We initially found that adding N reduced plant species richness less at elevated than at ambient CO2. Over time, however, this interaction reversed, and elevated CO2 amplified losses in diversity from enriched N, tripling reductions in species richness from N addition over the last eight years of the study. These interactions resulted from temporal changes in the drivers of diversity, especially light availability, that were in turn driven by CO2 and N inputs and associated changes in plant biomass. This mechanism is likely to be similar in many grasslands, because additions of the plant resources CO2 and N are likely to increase the abundance of the dominant species. If rising CO2 generally exacerbates the widespread negative impacts of N deposition on plant diversity, this bodes poorly for the conservation of grassland biodiversity worldwide.

 Dopamine signalling modes differ in kinetics and spatial patterns of receptor activation1,2. How these modes contribute to motor function, motivation and learning has long been debated3–21. Here we show that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for movement initiation but supports reward-oriented behaviour. We generated mice with dopamine-neuron-specific knockout of the release site organizer protein RIM to disrupt action-potential-induced dopamine release. In these mice, rapid in vivo dopamine dynamics were strongly impaired, but baseline dopamine persisted and fully supported spontaneous movement. Conversely, reserpine-mediated dopamine depletion or blockade of dopamine receptors disrupted movement initiation. The dopamine precursor l-DOPA reversed reserpine-induced bradykinesia without restoring fast dopamine dynamics, a result that substantiated the conclusion that these dynamics are dispensable for movement initiation. In contrast to spontaneous movement, reward-oriented behaviour was impaired in dopamine-neuron-specific RIM knockout mice. In conditioned place preference and two-odour discrimination tasks, the mice effectively learned to distinguish the cues, which indicates that reward-based learning persists after RIM ablation. However, the performance vigour was reduced. During probabilistic cue-reward association, dopamine dynamics and conditioned responses assessed through anticipatory licking were disrupted. These results demonstrate that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for motor function and subsecond precision of movement initiation but promotes motivation and performance during reward-guided behaviours. Experiments using conditional RIM1 and RIM2 knockout mice and acute pharmacological manipulations clarify the role of rapid dopamine dynamics, whereby these dynamics are dispensable for movement initiation but important for reward-guided conditioned behaviours."

Here we present a standardized checklist of all known vascular plants that occur on islands and document their geographical and phylogenetic distribution and conservation risk. Our analyses of 304,103 plant species reveal that 94,052 species (31%) are native to islands, which constitute 5.3% of the global landmass4. Of these, 63,280 are island endemic species, which represent 21% of global plant diversity. Three-quarters of these are restricted to large or isolated islands. Compared with the world flora, island endemics are non-randomly distributed within the tree of life, with a total of 1,005 billion years of unique phylogenetic history with 17 families and 1,702 genera being entirely endemic to islands. Of all vascular plants assigned International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation categories5, 22% are island endemics. Among these endemic species, 51% are threatened, and 55% of all documented global extinctions have occurred on islands. We find that of all single-island endemic species, only 6% occur on islands meeting the United Nations 30×30 conservation target. Urgent measures including habitat restoration, invasive species removal and ex situ programmes are needed to protect the world’s island flora. Our checklist quantifies the uniqueness of island life, provides a basis for future studies of island floras, and highlights the urgent need to take actions for conserving them. A standardized checklist of all known vascular plants shows the distribution of island native and endemic species, identifies their conservation status and highlights the need for actions to conserve them."

Woillez,The cool brown dwarf Gliese 229 B is a close binary,"Analysis of the cool brown dwarf Gliese 229 B suggests that it is actually a close binary of two less massive brown dwarfs, explaining its low luminosity and settling the conflict between theoretical predictions and measurements. 
 Owing to their similarities with giant exoplanets, brown dwarf companions of stars provide insights into the fundamental processes of planet formation and evolution. From their orbits, several brown dwarf companions are found to be more massive than theoretical predictions given their luminosities and the ages of their host stars1–3. Either the theory is incomplete or these objects are not single entities. For example, they could be two brown dwarfs each with a lower mass and intrinsic luminosity1,4. The most problematic example is Gliese 229 B (refs. 5,6), which is at least 2–6 times less luminous than model predictions given its dynamical mass of 71.4 ± 0.6 Jupiter masses (MJup) (ref. 1). We observed Gliese 229 B with the GRAVITY interferometer and, separately, the CRIRES+ spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Both sets of observations independently resolve Gliese 229 B into two components, Gliese 229 Ba and Bb, settling the conflict between theory and observations. The two objects have a flux ratio of 0.47 ± 0.03 at a wavelength of 2 μm and masses of 38.1 ± 1.0 and 34.4 ± 1.5 MJup, respectively. They orbit each other every 12.1 days with a semimajor axis of 0.042 astronomical units (au). The discovery of Gliese 229 BaBb, each only a few times more massive than the most massive planets, and separated by 16 times the Earth–moon distance, raises new questions about the formation and prevalence of tight binary brown dwarfs around stars. Analysis of the cool brown dwarf Gliese 229 B suggests that it is actually a close binary of two less massive brown dwarfs, explaining its low luminosity and settling the conflict between theoretical predictions and measurements."

 Microquasars are laboratories for the study of jets of relativistic particles produced by accretion onto a spinning black hole. Microquasars are near enough to allow detailed imaging of spatial features across the multiwavelength spectrum. The recent extension measurement of the spatial morphology of a microquasar, SS 433, to TeV gamma rays1 localizes the acceleration of electrons at shocks in the jet far from the black hole2. V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) is a similar binary system with a black hole and B-type main-sequence companion star and has an orbit period of 2.8 days (refs. 3,4). It stands out for its super-Eddington accretion5 and for its radio jet, which is one of the fastest superluminal jets in the Milky Way. Previous observations of V4641 Sgr did not report gamma-ray emission6. Here we report TeV gamma-ray emission from V4641 Sgr that reveals particle acceleration at similar distances from the black hole as SS 433. Furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum of V4641 Sgr is among the hardest TeV spectra observed from any known gamma-ray source and is detected above 200 TeV. Gamma rays are produced by particles, either electrons or protons, of higher energies. Because energetic electrons lose energy more quickly the higher their energy, such a spectrum either very strongly constrains the electron-production mechanism or points to the acceleration of high-energy protons. This suggests that large-scale jets from microquasars could be more common than previously expected and that they could be a notable source of galactic cosmic rays7–9.

 Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has an important yet often overlooked role in health and disease. Constraint models quantify the removal of deleterious variation from the population by selection and represent powerful tools for identifying genetic variation that underlies human phenotypes1–4. However, nuclear constraint models are not applicable to mtDNA, owing to its distinct features. Here we describe the development of a mitochondrial genome constraint model and its application to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), a large-scale population dataset that reports mtDNA variation across 56,434 human participants5. Specifically, we analyse constraint by comparing the observed variation in gnomAD to that expected under neutrality, which was calculated using a mtDNA mutational model and observed maximum heteroplasmy-level data. Our results highlight strong depletion of expected variation, which suggests that many deleterious mtDNA variants remain undetected. To aid their discovery, we compute constraint metrics for every mitochondrial protein, tRNA and rRNA gene, which revealed a range of intolerance to variation. We further characterize the most constrained regions within genes through regional constraint and identify the most constrained sites within the entire mitochondrial genome through local constraint, which showed enrichment of pathogenic variation. Constraint also clustered in three-dimensional structures, which provided insight into functionally important domains and their disease relevance. Notably, we identify constraint at often overlooked sites, including in rRNA and noncoding regions. Last, we demonstrate that these metrics can improve the discovery of deleterious variation that underlies rare and common phenotypes. Development of a constraint model specifically for mitochondrial DNA and applied to data from the Genome Aggregation Database provides insights into which sites in the mitochondrial genome are important for health and disease."

 Infant cerebral blood flow (CBF) delivers nutrients and oxygen to fulfill brain energy consumption requirements for the fastest period of postnatal brain development across the lifespan. However, organizing principle of whole-brain CBF dynamics during infancy remains obscure. Leveraging a unique cohort of 100+ infants with high-resolution arterial spin labeled MRI, we find the emergence of the cortical hierarchy revealed by the highest-resolution infant CBF maps available to date. Infant CBF across cortical regions increases in a biphasic pattern featured by initial rapid and subsequently slower rate, and break-point ages increasing along the limbic-sensorimotor-association cortical gradient. Increases in CBF in sensorimotor cortices are associated with enhanced language and motor skills, and frontoparietal association cortices with cognitive skills.

Using standard telecom components, it enables GHz bandwidth, nanosecond programmability, and MHz-level resolution. 
 Controlling the temporal evolution of an electromagnetic (EM) wave’s frequency components, the so-called time-frequency (TF) distribution, in a versatile and real-time fashion remains very challenging, especially at the high speeds (> GHz regime) required in contemporary communication, imaging, and sensing applications. We propose a general framework for manipulating the TF properties of high-speed EM waves. Specifically, the TF distribution is continuously mapped along the time domain through phase-only processing, enabling its user-defined manipulation via widely-available temporal modulation techniques. The time-mapping operations can then be inverted to reconstruct the TF-processed signal. Using off-the-shelf telecommunication components, we demonstrate arbitrary control of the TF distribution of EM waves over a full bandwidth approaching 100 GHz with nanosecond-scale programmability and MHz-level frequency resolution. We further demonstrate applications for mitigating rapidly changing frequency interference terms and the direct synthesis of fast waveforms with customized TF distributions. The reported method represents a significant advancement in TF processing of EM waves and it fulfills the stringent requirements for many modern and emerging applications.

 Fungal pathogens must exhibit strong nutritional plasticity, effectively sensing and utilizing diverse nutrients to support virulence. How the signals generated by nutritional sensing are efficiently translated to the morphogenetic machinery for optimal growth and support of virulence remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that the conserved morphogenesis-related kinase, CotA, imparts isoform-specific control over Aspergillus fumigatus invasive growth in host-mimicking environments and during infection. CotA-mediated invasive growth is responsive to exogenous carbon source quality, with only preferred carbon sources supporting hyphal morphogenesis in a mutant lacking one of two identified protein isoforms. Strikingly, we find that the CotA protein does not regulate, nor is cotA gene expression regulated by, the carbon catabolite repression system. Instead, we show that CotA partially mediates invasive growth in specific carbon sources and virulence through the conserved downstream effector and translational repressor, SsdA. Therefore, A. fumigatus CotA accomplishes its conserved morphogenetic functions to drive pathogenic growth by translating host-relevant carbon source quality signals into morphogenetic outputs for efficient tissue invasive growth.

 Earthquake swarms may be driven by fluids, through hydraulic injections or natural fluid circulation, but also by slow and aseismic slip transients. Understanding the driving factors for these prolific sequences and how they can potentially develop into larger ruptures remains a challenge. A notable and almost ubiquitous feature of swarms is their hypocenters migration, which occurrence is closely related to the processes driving the observed seismicity, in a similar way as seismicity accompanies slow-slip events at subduction zones. Here, we analyze global data on migrating sequences, and identify scaling laws for migration velocity, moment and duration measured on natural and injection-induced swarms, foreshock sequences, and slow slip events. We highlight two different behaviors among these sequences: one linked to slow slips, with elevated migration velocities and moments, and the other related to fluid-induced processes, featuring lower velocities and moments. These results provide metrics for distinguishing between the drivers of earthquake swarms, fluid or slow-slip related, and prompt a reevaluation of scaling laws of fault slip transients, especially for swarms.

 Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) in legume-rhizobia serves as a sustainable source of nitrogen (N) in agriculture. However, the addition of inorganic N fertilizers significantly inhibits SNF, and the underlying mechanisms remain not-well understood. Here, we report that inorganic N disrupts iron (Fe) homeostasis in soybean nodules, leading to a decrease in SNF efficiency. This disruption is attributed to the inhibition of the Fe transporter genes Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 2a and 2b (GmNRAMP2a&2b) by inorganic N. GmNRAMP2a&2b are predominantly localized at the tonoplast of uninfected nodule tissues, affecting Fe transfer to infected cells and consequently, modulating SNF efficiency. In addition, we identified a pair of N-signal regulators, nitrogen-regulated GARP-type transcription factors 1a and 1b (GmNIGT1a&1b), that negatively regulate the expression of GmNRAMP2a&2b, which establishes a link between N signaling and Fe homeostasis in nodules. Our findings reveal a plausible mechanism by which soybean adjusts SNF efficiency through Fe allocation in response to fluctuating inorganic N conditions, offering valuable insights for optimizing N and Fe management in legume-based agricultural systems.

However, there are discrepancies among reports on the existence and spectral location of universal scaling in Martian atmospheric data. Here, results indicate the smallest resolvable structures from Martian wind speed data are still associated with the energetic regime, which may ultimately explain why multiple reports have not found a consistent Kolmogorov-like spectral regime on Mars. Universal spectral scaling of wind data from Perseverance’s Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer is used to estimate the thresholds that separate three turbulence regimes: energetic, inertial, and molecular dissipation. Wind measurements at 2-Hz, the fastest sampling rate for direct wind sensor measurements on Mars, resolves turbulence in the energetic regime and approaches the inertial regime, which is consistent with reported Martian dust devil sizes.

 The early detection of forest pests and diseases is a primary focus of remote sensing applications for forest health monitoring. Pine Wilt Disease (PWD), which causes significant damage to pine resources in many countries and regions, has been a key area where the close-range hyperspectral remote sensing has demonstrated its advantages for early diagnosis. However, it remains unclear whether PWD can be detected during the pre-visual stage and, if so, how to achieve hyperspectral detection. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of pine species, infection responses, and data types on hyperspectral detection of PWD, particularly in the pre-visual stage. Artificial inoculation experiments were conducted across three locations with 76 sample trees of two pine species, and hyperspectral data were collected regularly using ground-based non-imaging and UAV imaging spectrometers Five infection responses were identified: keep healthy (KH), quick infection (QI), slow recovery (SR), quick recovery (QR), and slow infection (SI). Spectral analysis revealed dynamic changes in the indices RVI (680–550,750) and NDVI (560,680), corresponding well with the spectral characteristics of the five infection responses. The infected trees with QI response could be spectrally detected starting from day 14, with over 50 % accuracy. Importance analysis using RF identified RVI (554,677) and NDVI (531,570) as consistent in detecting pre-visual stages. In contrast, the six VIs determined by PCA-S (RARSb, RVI (900, 680), RVI (800, 680), RVI (760, 500), RVI (800, 635), and REP) exhibited high consistency and played a crucial role in identifying pre-visual stage infected trees. These VIs combined with specific color bands, enabled the creation of false-color images highlighting infected trees starting from day 14 post-inoculation. The study highlighted the importance of recognizing infection response patterns for accurate PWD detection, with only QI response trees showed a stable infection cycle, making day 14 post-infection a meaningful starting point for spectral detection. Additionally, imaging and non-imaging data types did not significantly affect the detection process, and the impact of spectral resolution variations between 1 nm and 3.5 nm was negligible. Further research is required to determine the threshold for larger differences of spectral resolution and to explore detection across various pine species and growth environments."

 Precise spatial mapping of individual species using hyperspectral data is crucial for effective forest management and policy-making. This study focuses on Rhododendron arboreum, known for its medicinal properties attributed to the flavonoid Quercitrin. Sample data and spectroradiometer data were collected from the complex terrain of the Kumaon region in the Himalayas. Hyperspectral data, which includes signal variations based on biophysical and biochemical properties along with noise, were preprocessed using filtering techniques to enhance signal clarity by removing noise. Smoothing techniques were applied to remove noisy bands from the spectra, such as the Savitzky-Golay filter for reduced least square fit complexity and the Average Mean filter for taking mean spectral values. Subsequently, Spectral Analysis (SA) techniques, including first derivative, second derivative, and continuum removal, were employed. These mathematical transformations highlighted absorption troughs and determined the effect of Quercitrin on spectral wavelengths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify the most relevant bands related to Quercitrin. Additionally, regression analysis was applied on resampled spectral data, selected significant wavelengths based on variable importance values, pinpointing the most prominent wavelengths: 1196, 1229, 1328, 1383, 1425, 1636, 1661, 1699, 1785, and 1715 nm.

For the development of prediction model, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were applied. The Random Forest model, which splits input data into trees to simulate the best model based on observed values, demonstrated high effectiveness in predicting Quercitrin levels, achieving a training correlation of 0.864 and a testing correlation of 0.570. Hence RF proved to be a best technique of band selection as well as robust for Quercitrin prediction.

 Extreme precipitation events (EPEs) are crucial in Antarctica, impacting the Antarctic ice sheet's surface mass balance and stability. Comprehensive case studies are essential for better understanding these events and the underlying processes driving them. Here, we investigate an extreme snowfall event in Dronning Maud Land (DML), East Antarctica on November 8 and 9, 2015. This event contributed approximately 22 % of the annual accumulation in less than two days and exhibited high spatial variability in precipitation distribution. We employed a high-resolution atmospheric model specifically optimized for the polar regions (Polar WRF) and ERA5 reanalysis data to analyze the event in detail. Our findings highlight the importance of a blocking high-pressure ridge of record strength that effectively blocked and diverted a strong extratropical cyclone into DML, ultimately leading to the heavy snowfall event. The sudden deepening of the cyclone was initiated by a ‘jet streak’ in the upper atmosphere that steered the system southeastwards towards the Antarctic coast. Notably, we observed an anomalously high poleward moisture transport in the form of a strong atmospheric river on November 7, 2015. This atmospheric river originated in the South Atlantic Ocean and tracked poleward from the 30°S-40°S latitude band. Vertical cross-sections of the model outputs indicate that most of the precipitation was concentrated in regions with steep orography along the path of the atmospheric river. This interaction between the atmospheric river and the steep terrain led to the uplift of maritime air, resulting in heavy snowfall. This study highlights the significance of extreme upper and lower atmospheric conditions in driving intense moisture transport towards coastal DML. The interaction between the atmospheric river and the steep orography contributed to heavy snowfall, underscoring the importance of considering orographic influences in understanding EPEs in Antarctica."

This paper assesses the welfare risks associated with that diversity, establishing seven species-level risk factors from involved parental care to long lifespans. Investigating these welfare risks across all aquatic species reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed an uneven distribution of risk, with extreme species-level risks in chordates, crustaceans, and cephalopod mollusks. Compared to species with fewer risks, species with extreme welfare risks were found to cost more and contribute the least to global production. This work challenges the notion that prioritizing animal welfare is incompatible with addressing food security and creates the possibility of identifying certain plant and invertebrate species, like seaweeds and bivalves, that minimize welfare concerns while providing affordability and accessibility.

However, the molecular mechanism remained unclear. Using genetically engineered mouse models to examine semaphorin 3D (SEMA3D), we identified a dual role for tumor- and nerve-derived SEMA3D in the malignant transformation of pancreatic epithelial cells and invasive PDA development. Pancreatic-specific knockout of the SEMA3D gene from the KRASG12Dand TP53R172Hmutation knock-in, PDX1-Cre(KPC) mouse model demonstrated delayed tumor initiation, prolonged survival, absence of metastasis, and reduced M2 macrophage expression. Mechanistically, tumor- and nerve-derived SEMA3D indirectly reprograms macrophages through KRASMUT-dependent ARF6 signaling in PDA cells, resulting in increased lactate production, which is sensed by GPCR132 on macrophages to stimulate protumorigenic M2 polarization. Multiplex immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased M2-polarized macrophages proximal to nerves in SEMA3D-expressing human PDA tissue. This study suggests that altered SEMA3D expression leads to an acquisition of cancer-promoting functions, and nerve-derived SEMA3D is “hijacked” by PDA cells to support growth and metastasis in a KRASMUT-dependent manner."

Transitioning from a proliferative to an invasive melanoma phenotype is coupled with increased ferroptosis vulnerability. However, the regulatory circuits controlling ferroptosis susceptibility across melanoma cell states are unknown. In this work, we identified Apolipoprotein E (APOE) as the top lipid-metabolism gene segregating the melanoma MITFhigh/AXLlowproliferative/ferroptosis-resistant from MITFlow/AXLhighinvasive/ferroptosis-sensitive state. Mechanistically, ApoE secreted by the MITFhigh/AXLlowcells protects the invasive phenotype from ferroptosis-inducing agents by reducing the content of peroxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids and boosting GPX4 levels both in vitro and in vivo. Whole-exome sequencing indicates thatAPOEhighexpression in patients with melanoma is associated with resistance to ferroptosis, regardless ofAPOEgermline status. In aggregate, we found a ferroptosis-resistance mechanism between melanoma cell states relying on secreted ApoE andAPOEhighexpression as a potential biomarker for poor ferroptosis response in melanoma."

In this context, the role of evolving global geodynamics and plate (re)organization on the spatial and temporal distribution of compositional heterogeneities in the convecting mantle is poorly understood.

These step changes in the sources of intraplate magmatism stem from a rapid increase in the supply of deeply subducted lithosphere during the protracted formation of Pangea following the widespread onset of “modern” (cold and deep) subduction in the late Neoproterozoic.

Using engineered cardiac microtissues (CMTs) composed of HCM-causingMYH7-variant hiPSC-CMs and wild-type fibroblasts, we observed cell-cell cross-talk leading to increased collagen deposition, tissue stiffening, and decreased contractility dependent on fibroblast proliferation. hiPSC-CM conditioned media and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data suggested that fibroblast proliferation is mediated by paracrine signals fromMYH7-variant cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase with erlotinib hydrochloride attenuated stromal activation.

We show that linear measures of the communication between the sender and receiver networks can discriminate between emergent or inherited population dynamics. A match in the dimensionality of the sender and receiver population activities promotes faithful communication. In contrast, a nonlinear mapping between the sender to receiver activity, for example, through downstream emergent population-wide fluctuations, can impair linear communication.

This suggests that the rate-strengthening friction commonly measured in clay-rich materials may govern episodic slow slip in landslides, in addition to tectonic faults. Further, our results show more generally that transient slow slip can arise in velocity-strengthening materials from modulation of effective normal stress through pore pressure fluctuations. This challenges the idea that episodic slow slip requires a narrow range of transitional frictional properties near the stability threshold, or pore pressure feedbacks operating on initially unstable frictional slip."

The aquaculture industry claims a decreasing dependence on wild fish, relying on the Fish In:Fish Out (FIFO) metric as a ratio of the quantity of wild fish required for farmed fish production. This is misleading because it usually assumes constant FM or FO yields, inclusion rates and feed conversion ratios, which vary widely. Thus, a constant FIFO value for a given species cannot be assumed. Furthermore, low FIFO values resulting from averaging carnivores and herbivores conceal the high feed requirements of carnivore species.

Collectively, we refer to these four types of risks as “dewilding.” In this systematic review, we searched Scopus and Web of Science for recent literature documenting mariculture’s dewilding impacts to organize and collate this evidence under one unified framework. We find that mariculture’s dewilding impacts are consistently documented, though often in isolation, and that captivity and conceptual dewilding impacts are recognized as potential harms far less than impacts on the environment and wildlife. Future work examining mariculture’s dewilding impacts will be paramount to guiding human decision-making and activity going forward."

Three pathogens are prevalent in farmed Atlantic salmon in BC, spill over to wild Pacific salmon, and are linked to negative impacts on wild salmon: Piscine orthoreovirus,Tenacibaculumspp., and sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). Molecular screening of infectious agents in farmed and wild salmon and environmental DNA highlights a further 4 agents that are likely elevated near salmon farms and 37 that co-occur in wild and farmed salmon. Pathogens likely affect wild salmon indirectly by mediating migration, competition, and predation. Current net-pen aquaculture practices pose these risks to numerous populations of all species of wild salmon in BC, most of which are not covered in Government of Canada science and advisory reports.

Furthermore, a metric that incorporates wild fish mortality during capture and excludes unfed systems raises the wild fish mortality–to–farmed fish output ratio to 0.57 to 1.78. We also evaluate terrestrial ingredients in aquaculture feeds. Widely cited estimates of declines in wild fish use from 1997 to 2017 entailed a trade-off of more than fivefold increase in feed crops over the same period.

The streamflow response to heatwaves depends strongly on heatwave timing and temperature, and the amount of snow and glacier ice available to melt. However, as ongoing climate change continues to alter both seasonal melt patterns and the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, it is not well understood how such streamflow responses will evolve relative to the seasonal cycle of streamflow. We address this knowledge gap by using long-term meteorological and hydrological datasets to characterize spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the streamflow sensitivity to heatwaves at six basins with >80 years of observations in Western Canada. We use years with earlier freshets and less snowfall as proxies of anticipated climate change, and apply a metric to describe how the streamflow sensitivity to heatwaves varies across years with different hydro-climatological characteristics. We find that in future proxy years relative to baseline years, nival streamflow is more sensitive to early spring heatwaves but less sensitive to late spring and summer heatwaves. Relative to baseline years, late spring heatwaves in future proxy years generate a smaller fraction of peak streamflow that is diminished as the freshet progresses. Our findings imply that future heatwave-driven peak flows in spring may be lessened by the diminished streamflow sensitivity to heatwaves in late spring, but this may be partially offset by excess melt during future heatwaves that are longer and hotter."

We argue that current efforts to mitigate this problem, which focus largely on informational policy instruments for global supply chains, could result in unintended side effects. The reason pertains to a potential tradeoff between a home bias in consumption and the geographic allocation of environmental impacts. We develop a theoretical argument on how consumers may respond when they prefer a domestically produced good but are made aware that this results in more environmental damage at home, compared to importing the same product from abroad. Based on choice experiments in Germany, Japan, and the United States, we observe that information provision can reduce consumer demand for environmentally harmful products, but also find some support for environmental NIMBYism when environmental and provenance information are combined. The key implication of this finding is that policymakers should address potentially unintended side-effects of more stringent informational requirements for global supply chains."

Powerplants represent the single largest and most concentrated form of global GHG emissions. Climate Trace, co-founded and promoted by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, is a new effort using, in part, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to estimate asset-scale GHG emissions. Climate Trace recently released a database of global powerplant CO2 emissions at the facility-scale that uses both AI and non-AI estimation approaches. However, no independent peer-reviewed assessment has been made of this important global emissions database. Here, we compare the Climate Trace powerplant CO2 emissions to an atmospherically calibrated, multi-constraint estimate of powerplant CO2 emissions in the United States. The 3.7% (65) of compared facilities that used an AI-based approach show a mean relative difference (MRD) of −1.1% (SD: 46.4%) in the year 2019. The 96.3% (1726) of the facilities that used a non-AI-based approach show a MRD of −50.0% (SD: 117.7%). Of the non-AI estimated facilities, 151 (8.7%) facilities agree to within ±20%. The large differences between Climate Trace and Vulcan-power emission estimates for these facilities is primarily caused by Climate Trace’ use of a national-mean power plant capacity factor (CF) which is a poor representation of the reported power plant CFs of individual US facilities and leads to very large errors at those same 1726 facilities."

However, BCR technology assessments in Germany, which are used as the basis for strategic decision-making, are often limited to woody biomass as an input material and are based on old data. Consequently, this study focuses on BCR from forest residues, straw and sewage sludge and assesses its contribution to negative emissions under current techno-economic framework conditions. Using life cycle assessment and annuity method, as well as complementary stakeholder engagement formats, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of BCR pathways in Germany based on an empirical, up-to-date data basis. The results highlight the environmental advantages of BCR, particularly in reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to the conventional treatment of residues. The economic feasibility of BCR is uncertain, with profitability dependent on plant scale, biomass type and the integration of energy co-products. Stakeholder insights underscore the necessity for supportive policies and investment in BCR technology to enhance scalability. This interdisciplinary approach enriches the discourse on BCR’s role in achieving carbon neutrality and offers a robust data foundation for future evaluations."

Using a narrative review, this paper explores how published research has used art and arts-based approaches to explore dimensions of water injustice, wellbeing and mental health with Indigenous communities living in the Arctic and Amazon regions. Within the three central themes of the review (wellbeing, water justice, and arts-based research approaches), the most discussed emergent themes were: relationship to place, kinship, the lived experience of water, ongoing changes to water, and storytelling and art as instruments of resistance and to make visible what is not visible. The paper discusses those themes from the literature, and possible areas of future research.

This burden disproportionately affects women, who are often responsible for collecting water from distant sources in regions with limited or no water supply systems. Understanding the spatial patterns of socio-demographic and hydrological factors is key to address the interlinked challenges of gender equality and water security under SDG 5 (‘Achieve gender equality’) and SDG 6. While the challenges women face in securing water are widely recognized, quantitative analysis of gender inequality in global water security has not previously been studied. Here, we present, to our knowledge the first global assessment of gender inequality in water security. We measured water security by examining both water access and water scarcity (hereafter, water stress), incorporating population data for working-age individuals and children. We integrated this hydrological and demographic information at a spatial resolution of approximately 10 km from 2000 to 2014 when the information is available. Our results showed that more working-age women than men experience poor water access, particularly in Africa. In addition, women in countries with high water insecurity, defined as high water stress and poor water access—such as Burkina Faso, Togo, and Somalia—primary conduct water collection. Our results indicate significant gender-based differences in water security, with women frequently remaining in rural areas characterized by poor water access.

Despite the unprecedented scope of firefighting operations in recent years, their contribution to patterns of wildfire severity is rarely quantified. Here we investigate how wildland fire suppression operations and past fire severity interacted to affect severity patterns of the northern third of the 374 000 ha Dixie Fire, the largest single fire in California history. We developed a map of the intensity and type of suppression operations and a statistical model of the Composite Burn Index (CBI) including weather, fuels, and terrain variables during the fire to quantify the importance of operations and prior fires on wildfire severity. Wildfire severity was estimated without operations and previous fires and then compared with modeled severity under observed conditions. Previous low and moderate-severity fire without operations decreased CBI by 38% and 19% respectively. Heavy operations and offensive firing in the footprint of past fires lowered fire severity even more compared to prior fire alone. Medium operations and defensive firing reduced but did not eliminate the moderating effects of past fires. This analysis demonstrates important interactions between suppression operations and previous burns that drive patterns of fire severity and vegetation dynamics in post-fire landscapes. Given the need to reduce wildfire severity to maintain forest resilience, particularly with a warming climate, increased attention to using operations and severity patterns of previous fires known to reduce wildfire severity in megafires are likely to increase forest resilience and improve ecological outcomes."

This research gap constrains our comprehensive of the mechanisms underlying natural bacterial resistance formation during pre-antibiotic era (prior to the 1940s) and the development of human-induced bacterial resistance in post-antibiotic era (since the 1940s). In this study, we examined the vertical distribution patterns of ARGs and their associated hosts within a sedimentary core from a eutrophic lake, employing shotgun sequencing methodology. The findings revealed a marked increase in ARG diversity during post-antibiotic era, and the predominant ARG types identified included those conferring resistance to multidrug, bacitracin, macrolide–lincosamide–streptogramin, beta-lactam, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, glycopeptide and aminoglycoside, collectively accounting for 78.3%–85.6% of total ARG abundance. A total of 127 ARG subtypes were identified in samples, and 48 ARG subtypes shared across vertical sediment resistome profile with two of them, bacA and bcrA, occurring only in post-antibiotic era. Further, 137 metagenome-assembled genomes (83 species belonging to 12 phyla) were identified as ARG hosts, mainly belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria, Nitrospirota, Chloroflexota, Bacteroidota, Actinobacteriota, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes. Significant correlation was found between the diversity of ARG and the concentrations of organic matter and heavy metals, suggesting a common source of contamination. Aside the fact that human-induced eutrophication is a forcing factor acting in parallel to increase ARGs releases in water systems, both being indicators of increased urbanization in the catchment, eutrophication may significantly increase bacterial activity, thereby facilitating the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in environment.

This uncertainty directly translates into subsequent assessments, as land areas with potential groundwater accessibility for forests, population, and areas equipped for irrigation, differ substantially depending on the chosen model. We explore reasons for these differences and find that contrary to observations, 3 out of 4 models show deeper water tables in humid than in arid climates and greatly overestimate how strongly topographic slope controls WTD.

We assess the most cost-effective strategy for low-carbon ammonia production at each facility, both with and without the influence of these policies. Our results indicate that Canada’s carbon tax incentivizes the adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS), while the US production tax credits promote the use of wind energy and biomass coupled with CCS, to produce hydrogen for ammonia synthesis. These findings highlight a dichotomy between the impacts of tax credits and carbon taxes: production tax credits facilitate the transition to low-carbon production methods, whereas carbon taxes incentivize existing facilities to upgrade with CCS technology. These insights underscore the effectiveness of tailored policy approaches and provide a comprehensive blueprint for other regions globally seeking to transition towards low-carbon ammonia production."

During three field campaigns on a grassland and agroforestry grassland, we compared the LC-EC with a conventional eddy covariance (CON-EC) system. Our results show that LC-EC has the potential to measure EC fluxes at only approximately 25 % of the cost of a CON-EC system. 
 Eddy covariance (EC) measurements can provide direct and non-invasive ecosystem measurements of the exchange of energy, water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). However, conventional eddy covariance (CON-EC) setups (ultrasonic anemometer and infrared gas analyser) can be expensive, which recently led to the development of lower-cost eddy covariance (LC-EC) setups (University of Exeter). In the current study, we tested the performance of an LC-EC setup for CO2 and H2O flux measurements at an agroforestry and adjacent grassland site in a temperate ecosystem in northern Germany. The closed-path LC-EC setup was compared with a CON-EC setup using an enclosed-path gas analyser (LI-7200, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The LC-EC CO2 fluxes were lower compared to CON-EC by 4 %–7 % (R2=0.91–0.95), and the latent heat (LE) fluxes were higher by 1 %–5 % in 2020 and 23 % in 2021 (R2=0.84–0.91). The large difference between latent heat fluxes in 2021 seemed to be a consequence of the lower LE fluxes measured by the CON-EC. Due to the slower response sensors of the LC-EC setup, the (co)spectra of the LC-EC were more attenuated in the high-frequency range compared to the CON-EC. The stronger attenuation of the LC-EC led to larger cumulative differences between spectral methods of 0.15 %–38.8 % compared to  0.02 %–11.36 % of the CON-EC. At the agroforestry site where the flux tower was taller compared to the grassland, the attenuation was lower because the cospectrum peak and energy-containing eddies shift to lower frequencies which the LC-EC can measure.

Sarrazin;Sabine Attinger;Rohini Kumar,Gridded dataset of nitrogen and phosphorus point sources from wastewater in Germany (1950–2019),"Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contamination of water bodies is a long-term issue due to the long history of N and P inputs to the environment and their persistence. Here, we introduce a long-term and high-resolution dataset of N and P inputs from wastewater (point sources) for Germany, combining data from different sources and conceptual understanding. We also account for uncertainties in modelling choices, thus facilitating robust long-term and large-scale water quality studies. 
 Knowledge about the long history of the anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is crucial to capture long-term N and P processes (legacies) and to investigate water quality and ecosystem health. These inputs include N and P point sources, which mainly originate from wastewater and which are directly discharged into surface waters, thus having an immediate impact on ecosystem functioning. However, N and P point sources are challenging to estimate, due to the scarcity of and uncertainty in observational data. Here, we contribute towards improved characterisation of N and P point sources from wastewater by providing a long-term (1950–2019), high-resolution (0.015625° ≈1.4 km on average) dataset for Germany. The dataset includes both domestic and industrial emissions treated in wastewater treatment plants and untreated domestic emissions that are collected in the sewer system. We adopt a modelling approach that relies on a large range of data collected from different sources. Importantly, we account for the uncertainties arising from different modelling choices (i.e. coefficients and downscaling approach). We provide 200 gridded N and P point source realisations, which are constrained and evaluated using available (recent) observations of wastewater treatment plants' outgoing loads. We discuss the uncertainties in our reconstructed dataset over a large sample of river basins in Germany and provide guidance for future uses. Overall, by capturing the long-term spatial and temporal variations in N and P point sources and accounting for uncertainties, our dataset can facilitate long-term and large-scale robust water quality studies.

Researchers collected data from 40 beech and spruce forest sites in spring and summer 2023, using a standardized method to ensure consistency. The results show that water sources for trees change between seasons and vary by tree species. This large dataset offers valuable information for understanding plant water use, improving ecohydrological models, and mapping water cycles across Europe. 
 Stable isotope ratios of hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ18O) are crucial for studying ecohydrological dynamics in forests. However, most studies are confined to single sites, resulting in a lack of large-scale isotope data for understanding tree water uptake. Here, we provide a first systematic isotope dataset of soil and stem xylem water collected during two pan-European sampling campaigns at 40 beech (Fagus sylvatica), spruce (Picea abies), or mixed beech-spruce forest sites in spring and summer 2023 (Lehmann et al., 2024). The dataset is complemented by additional site-, soil-, and tree-specific metadata. The samples and metadata were collected by different researchers across Europe following a standardized protocol. Soil samples were taken at up to 5 depths (ranging from 0 to 90 cm) and stem xylem samples from three beech and/or spruce trees per site. All samples were sent to a single laboratory, where all analytical work was conducted. Water was extracted using cryogenic vacuum distillation and analyzed with an isotope laser spectrometer. Additionally, a subset of the samples was analyzed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Data quality checks revealed a high mean total extraction efficiency, mean absolute water amount (> 1 mL), as well as high analytical accuracy and precision. The water isotopic signature of soil and stem xylem water varied as a function of the geographic origin and changed from spring to summer across all sites. While δ2H and δ18O values were strongly correlated, the soil water data plotted closer to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) than the stem xylem water. Specifically, the δ2H values of the stem xylem were more enriched than those of the soil water, leading to a systematic deviation from the GMWL. Isotopic enrichment of the stem xylem water was larger for spruce than for beech trees at mixed forest sites. This dataset is particularly useful for large-scale studies on plant water use, ecohydrological model testing, and isotope mapping across Europe."

This new feature helps us understand how water is used and supplied in various areas. We tested our model from 1971 to 2010 and found that it accurately identifies areas with water scarcity. By modelling the competition between sectors when water availability is limited, the model helps estimate the intensity and extent of individual sectors' water shortages. 
 Water scarcity is exacerbated by rising water use and climate change, yet state-of-the-art Earth system models typically do not represent human water demand. Here we present an enhancement to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and its land (CLM5) and river (MOSART) components by introducing sectoral water abstractions. The new module enables a better understanding of water demand and supply dynamics across various sectors, including domestic, livestock, thermoelectric, manufacturing, mining, and irrigation. The module conserves water by integrating abstractions from the land component with river component flows and dynamically calculates daily water scarcity based on local demand and supply. Through land-only simulations spanning 1971–2010, we verify our model against known water scarcity hotspots, historical global water withdrawal trends, and regional variations in water use. Our findings show that non-irrigative sectoral consumption has an insignificant effect on regional climate, while emphasizing the importance of including all sectors for water scarcity assessment capabilities. Despite its advancements, the model's limitations, such as its exclusive focus on river water abstractions, highlight areas for potential future refinement. This research paves the way for a more holistic representation of human–water interactions in ESMs, aiming to inform sustainable water management decisions in an evolving global landscape."

However, the occurrence and distribution of DIRMs in iodine-rich groundwater remain unclear. In this study, we isolated the dissimilatory iodate-reducing bacteriumAzonexus hydrophilusstrain NCP973 from a geogenic high-iodine groundwater of China for the first time. The analysis of genome, transcriptome, and heterologous expression revealed that strain NCP973 uses the dissimilatory iodate-reducing enzyme IdrABP1P2 to reduce dissolved or in situ sediment-bound iodate to iodide. The location of IdrABP1P2 in the conjugative plasmid of strain NCP973 implies that IdrABP1P2 could be spread by horizontal gene transfer and allow the recipient microorganisms to participate in the enrichment of iodide in aquifers. Based on the global iodine-rich groundwater metagenomes and genomes, the identification of idrA showed that phylogenetically diverse DIRMs are widely distributed not only in geogenic high-iodine groundwater of China but also in radionuclide-contaminated groundwater of USA as well as in subsurface cavern waters in Germany and Italy. Moreover, the abundance of idrA was found to be higher in groundwater with a relatively high iodine content. Collectively, these results suggest that terrestrial iodine-affected groundwater systems are another important habitat for DIRMs in addition to marine environments, and their activity in aquifers triggers the mobilization and enrichment of iodine in groundwater worldwide."

In this investigation, larval zebrafish were exposed to 0.05, 0.5, and 5.0 μg/L EHDPP from 4 to 120 h postfertilization (hpf) to examine the long-term neurotoxicity effects of early exposure. Exposure to 5.0 μg/L EHDPP yielded hyperactive locomotor behavior, which was characterized by increased swimming speed, larger turning angles, and heightened sensitivity to light-dark stimulation. The predicted targets of EHDPP (top 100 potential macromolecules) were primarily associated with brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Comparisons of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from AD patients (GSE48350) and RNA-seq data from EHDPP-exposed zebrafish confirmed consistently abnormal regulatory pathways. EHDPP’s interaction with M1 and M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors likely disrupted calcium homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotransmitter imbalance as well as abnormal locomotor behavior. Especially, 5.0 μg/L EHDPP exposure during early development (4–120 hpf) triggered early- and midstage AD-like symptoms in adulthood (180 dpf), characterized by cognitive confusion, aggression, blood–brain barrier disruption, and mitochondrial damage in brains. These findings provide deep insights into the long-term neurotoxicity effects and Alzheimer’s disease risks of early EHDPP exposure at extremely low dosages."

Such information is even scarce for alternative plasticizers. CKD patients were recruited from 2011 to 2020 in Korea (n = 200) and assessed for the temporal changes of both traditional and alternative plasticizer exposure. Their associations with kidney dysfunction were also investigated. In CKD patients, urinary levels of DEP, BBzP, and DEHP metabolites declined significantly during this period, while those of the DEHTP metabolite increased. The level of DEHP metabolites showed a negative association with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in multiple association models, but additional eGFR subgroup analysis failed to show consistent results. Associations between phthalate exposure and eGFR were influenced by the severity of kidney dysfunction: DEHP and BBzP exposure showed negative associations with eGFR only among the patients with moderate kidney dysfunction (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2). Changing associations by CKD severity may be explained by negative correlations between eGFR and both urinary creatinine concentration and specific gravity. Our observations show that DEHTP has rapidly replaced DEHP and exposure to several phthalates adversely influences kidney function even among CKD patients."

Passage of vent gases through an alkaline spray has been proposed for scrubbing SF, but base hydrolysis is insufficiently fast and generates equal yields of fluoride and fluorosulfate, the latter of unknown environmental hazard. We report here that alkaline hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) markedly accelerates SF removal and gives nearly quantitative yield of fluoride, with fluorosulfate produced in less than 3.5% yield. The other major products are sulfate, peroxymonosulfate, and oxygen. The oxidation state of S was unchanged. Hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavengers had no effect on the rate. The reaction proceeds by sequential nucleophilic displacement of fluoride by hydroperoxide ion (HO2–) to form a transient diperoxysulfate species that rapidly undergoes intramolecular redox rearrangement to give sulfate and singlet oxygen. Peroxymonosulfate, produced through side reactions, can fully defluorinate SF as well, although more slowly. Two new peaks were detected in the 19F-NMR spectrum corresponding to intermediates. Fluoride can be removed conventionally, and the other products are innocuous or short-lived. Thus, H2O2-assisted alkaline defluorination promises to be an effective method for scrubbing spent SF fumes and preventing SF from reaching the atmosphere.

Yet, the complexity and high degree of nonresolved isomers still hamper the full structural analysis of DOM. To address this challenge, we developed an offline two-dimensional (2D) LC approach using two reversed-phase dimensions with orthogonal pH levels, followed by MS/MS data acquisition and molecular networking. 2D-LC-MS/MS reduced the complexity of DOM, enhancing the quality of MS/MS spectra and increasing spectral annotation rates.

In situ particle observations provide useful information for determining the significance of nonlinearity in wave‐particle interactions.

During this event, protons with energy ∼ ${\sim} $748 eV and pitch angle ∼25° ${\sim} 25{}^{\circ}$ are observed to resonate with electromagnetic‐ion‐cyclotron waves. Detailed data analysis reveals the existence of a second harmonic signal in proton modulation. Using an observation‐based test particle simulation, this signal is explained as a low‐resolution manifestation of phase space rolled‐up structures, which themselves are not observable due to limited instrument resolution. The presence of these rolled‐up structures suggests that the waves induce significant displacement of the protons in phase space, consequently confirming the nonlinear nature of the observed interaction.

Results show that the size and celerity of superimposed bedforms decreases along the host‐bedform lee slope, leading to a systematic downstream increase in the sediment accumulation rate relative to bedform celerity. This increase in local bedform climb angle results in the preservation of a larger fraction of formative bedforms.

In this study, we present the first numerical effort to quantify bioluminescent light intensity based on high‐fidelity direct numerical simulations of breaking waves and a quantitative bioluminescent model. The dynamics of breaking waves are extensively validated through comparison with existing studies. We find that the time‐averaged and Lagrangian‐averaged shear stress saturates as surface tension effects decrease and wave steepness increases. The spatial distribution of light intensity correlates with the wave crest overturning and air bubbles generated in plunging breakers. Furthermore, we observe that the maximum light intensity asymptotically approaches the emission of single cells, suggesting the potential for cost‐effective prediction models in future studies."

Magnetic hole (MH), sometimes referred to as magnetic bottle, exhibits strong magnetic fields at its neck but weak magnetic fields at its belly. Such structure has been widely reported in the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere, but has not been reported at Jupiter. Here, for the first time, we report two MHs in the Jupiter's magnetosphere by utilizing measurements of the Juno mission, with one existing in the dawn side and the other existing in the dusk side. We find that the electron pitch‐angle distribution inside the MHs can be either cigar‐type or pancake‐type. The cigar‐type distribution probably appears at the belly of the MH, whereas the pancake‐type distribution probably appears at the neck. Our analyses of the depression of magnetic fields inside the MHs support such a conjunction. These results have advanced our understanding of the transient structure and its related electron dynamics in the giant planets' magnetosphere."

The simulations are performed at 0.5bar $0.5\,\mathrm{b}\mathrm{a}\mathrm{r}$ using two photoionization methods: the Helmholtz approximation for a photon density and a Monte Carlo method using discrete photons, with the latter being the most realistic. We consider cases with single streamers, streamer branching, streamers interacting with preionization and streamer‐streamer encounters. We do not observe a strong VHF radio signal during or after branching, which is confirmed by lab experiments. This indicates that the current inside a streamer discharge evolves approximately continuously during branching. On the other hand, stochastic fluctuations in streamer propagation due to Monte Carlo photoionization lead to more radio emission being emitted at frequencies of 100 MHz and above. Another process that leads to such high‐frequency emission is the interaction of a streamer with a weakly preionized region, which can be present due to a previous discharge. In agreement with previous work, we observe the strongest and highest‐frequency emission from streamer encounters. The amount of total energy that is radiated seems to depend primarily on the background electric field, and less on the particular streamer evolution. Finally, we present approximations for the maximal current along a streamer channel and a fit formula for a streamer's current moment."

Petrik,Estimating Fishing Exploitation Rates to Simulate Global Catches and Biomass Changes of Pelagic and Demersal Fish,"
Robust projections of future trends in global fish biomass, production and catches are needed for informed fisheries policy in a changing climate. Trust in future projections, however, relies on establishing that models can accurately simulate past relationships between exploitation rates and ecosystem states. In addition, historical simulations are important to describe how the oceans have changed due to fishing. Here we use fisheries catch, catch‐only assessment models and effort data to estimate regional fishing exploitation levels, defined as the fishing mortality relative to fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (F/FMSY). These estimates are given for large pelagic, forage and demersal fish types across all large marine ecosystems and the high seas between 1961 and 2004; and with a ‘ramp‐up’ between 1841 and 1960. We find that global exploitation rates for large pelagic and demersal fish consistently exceed those for forage fish and peak in the late 1980s. We use the rates to globally simulate historical fishing patterns in a mechanistic fish community model. The modeled catch aligns with the reconstructed catch, both for total catch and catch distribution by functional type. Simulations show a clear deviation from an unfished model state, with a 25% reduction in biomass in large pelagic and demersal fish in shelf regions in recent years and a 50% increase in forage fish, primarily due to reduced predation. The simulations can set a baseline for assessing the effect of climate change relative to fishing. The results highlight the influential role of fishing as a primary driver of global fish community dynamics."

Non‐point source pollution is one of the primary causes for water quality deterioration, and thus an emerging imperative in limnology is establishing empirical models that connect watershed attributes and hydrological drivers with lake nutrient dynamics. Here, we compiled three nation‐wide nutrient, meteorological, and watershed‐landscape data sets, to develop Generalized Linear Models that predict lake phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations as a function of the surrounding watershed characteristics within various hydrological distances across 104 Chinese lakes and reservoirs. Our national‐scale investigation revealed that lake nutrient concentrations can be satisfactorily predicted by proxies of natural drivers and anthropogenic activities, reflecting the properties of the surrounding watershed. Counter to previous studies, we found that China's lake nutrient concentrations strongly depend on watershed characteristics within a hydrological distance of less than 45 km rather than the entire watershed. Furthermore, extensive human activities in watersheds not only compromise our predictive capacity, but also increase the hydrological distance that is relevant to predict lake nutrients. This national‐scale characterization can inform one of the most contentious issues in the context of China's lake management, that is, the determination of the extent of the nearshore area, where nutrient control should be prioritized. As far as we know, our study represents the first attempt to apply the concept of hydrological distance and establish statistical models that can delineate the critical spatial domain primarily responsible for the nutrient conditions along the watershed‐lake continuum."

 One of the two X-chromosomes in female mammals is epigenetically silenced in embryonic stem cells by X-chromosome inactivation. This creates a mosaic of cells expressing either the maternal or the paternal X allele. The X-chromosome inactivation ratio, the proportion of inactivated parental alleles, varies widely among individuals, representing the largest instance of epigenetic variability within mammalian populations. While various contributing factors to X-chromosome inactivation variability are recognized, namely stochastic and/or genetic effects, their relative contributions are poorly understood. This is due in part to limited cross-species analysis, making it difficult to distinguish between generalizable or species-specific mechanisms for X-chromosome inactivation ratio variability. To address this gap, we measure X-chromosome inactivation ratios in ten mammalian species (9531 individual samples), ranging from rodents to primates, and compare the strength of stochastic models or genetic factors for explaining X-chromosome inactivation variability. Our results demonstrate the embryonic stochasticity of X-chromosome inactivation is a general explanatory model for population X-chromosome inactivation variability in mammals, while genetic factors play a minor role.

 Minerals in soil can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide through natural organic and inorganic processes. Here we consider three soil- and mineral-based methods for carbon dioxide removal: (1) grinding and spreading of calcium- and magnesium-rich silicate rocks for enhanced rock weathering and subsequent inorganic carbon formation, (2) mineral doping of biomass prior to conversion into biochar for enhanced biochar carbon yield and stability, and (3) strategic application of minerals to soil to increase soil organic carbon accrual and stability. We argue that there are powerful synergies between these approaches for carbon dioxide removal through organic and inorganic pathways. We find that primary silicates, as contained in basalt, can benefit both enhanced weathering and soil organic carbon formation, while phyllosilicates and other reactive secondary minerals may have positive synergies for biochar and soil organic carbon. Optimising such synergies may substantially enhance economic and environmental benefits, yet these synergies require accurate quantification.

 Grassland landscapes are important ecosystems in East Africa, providing habitat and grazing grounds for wildlife and livestock and supporting pastoralism, an essential part of the agricultural sector.

The application of a dynamical downscaling step allows us to capture the fine-scale effects of the region’s complex climate, its variability and future changes.

 Volcano monitoring is constrained by the distribution of sensors that record activity. Here, we explore the role of crowdsourcing to broaden acoustic monitoring records by surveying people across Aotearoa New Zealand about the sounds they heard following the 2022 climactic eruption of Hunga volcano in Tonga. We compare the 1930 survey responses to geophysical records of the pressure waves and find that they align well, both recording ~5-7 audible signals of varying amplitude with a peak of 60-80 decibels, arriving in two 30-minute phases ~3 hours post-eruption, travelling North-to-South. The crowdsourced observations fill instrumental gaps regarding the wave’s audible frequencies and contribute insights into interactions between the far-field acoustic wave and the social and built environment. Descriptions of short-lived impacts reveal that pressure waves are capable of substantial disturbances thousands of kilometers from the vent. We demonstrate that crowdsourcing can support traditional monitoring as a reliable low-cost method to capture perishable data.

 On Earth, solar radiation can transmit down to multiple metres within ice, depending on its optical properties. Organisms within ice can harness energy from photosynthetically active radiation while being protected from damaging ultraviolet radiation. On Mars, the lack of an effective ozone shield allows ~30% more damaging ultraviolet radiation to reach the surface in comparison with Earth. However, our radiative transfer modelling shows that despite the intense surface ultraviolet radiation, there are radiatively habitable zones within exposed mid-latitude ice on Mars, at depths ranging from a few centimetres for ice with 0.01–0.1% dust, and up to a few metres within cleaner ice. Numerical models predict that dense dusty snow in the martian mid-latitudes can melt below the surface at present. Thus, if small amounts of liquid water are available at these depths, mid-latitude ice exposures could represent the most easily accessible locations to search for extant life on Mars.

 Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has recently emerged as a proxy for canopy photosynthesis of vegetation and offers a promising approach for scalable remote crop monitoring. Effective application of SIF for crop monitoring requires better understanding of the processes that cause SIF-photosynthesis decoupling at leaf and canopy scales. To answer this challenge, we developed a novel automated multi-targeting hyperspectral spectrometer (OctoFlox). First, we evaluated the performance of OctoFlox and found high stability and cross-channel comparability. Second, we performed an evaluation of different SIF retrieval methods to identify the best suited retrieval method for our system configuration for both red (SIFRed) and far-red SIF (SIFFR). We then deployed OctoFlox within Soil-Plant Atmosphere Research (SPAR) controlled-environment chambers that enable measurement of canopy-scale SIF and photosynthesis with matching footprints. We analyzed the effect of the SPAR chamber tops on the light environment and found minimal impact on the spectral response. Lastly, we examined the response of SIF and canopy photosynthesis using the SPAR chambers. Soybean plants were evaluated at pre-drought, drought (irrigated at 100 % field capacity vs. 33 % field capacity for 2 weeks) and after 1 week recovery from drought. During early growing season, SIFFR and SIFRed exhibited similar responses. At peak growing season (R2 growth stage), SIFFR increased during afternoon depression of photosynthesis, but SIFRed decreased. We demonstrate that pairing SIF instrumentation with SPAR chambers can accelerate understanding SIF-photosynthesis relationships from diurnal to seasonal scales in relation to crop physiological responses to abiotic stress. We provide user recommendations for future applications using OctoFlox and SPAR chambers for co-measuring SIF and GPP."

 Knowledge about the impact craters on rocky planets is crucial for understanding the evolutionary history of the universe. Compared to traditional visual interpretation, deep learning approaches have improved the efficiency of crater detection. However, single-source data and divergent data quality limit the accuracy of crater detection. In this study, we focus on valuable features in multi-modal remote sensing data from Chang’e lunar exploration mission and propose an Attention-based Dual-branch Segmentation Network (ADSNet). First, we use ADSNet to extract the multi-modal features via a dual-branch encoder. Second, we introduce a novel attention for data fusion where the features from the auxiliary modality are weighted by a scoring function and then being fused with those from the primary modality. After fusion, the features are transferred to the decoder through skip connection. Lastly, high-accuracy crater detection is achieved based on the learned multi-modal data features through semantic segmentation. Our results demonstrate that ADSNet outperforms other baseline models in many metrics such as IoU and F1 score.

 This study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal variation, chemical characteristics and source apportionment of marine fine particles (PM2.5), and to analyze the transport route towards the intersectional region of the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Sampling of PM2.5 was conducted simultaneously at Penghu and Dongsha Islands for 14 consecutive days each quarter from summer 2019 to spring 2020. PM2.5 samples were then returned for conditioning, weighting, and chemical analysis. The chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model was used to identify the potential PM2.5 sources. It results show that the lowest PM2.5 concentrations were observed in summer, with a gradual increase starting fall, influenced by Asia Northeastern Monsoons (ANMs) transporting particles from the north to Penghu and Dongsha Islands. The most abundant water-soluble ionic species in PM2.5 were SO42−, NO3− and NH4+, catalogued as the secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs). Meanwhile, the most abundant metals in PM2.5 were crustal elements (Mg, K, Ca, Fe, and Al), while the concentrations of trace metals (V, Cr, Mn, Ni, As, Cd, and Pb), mainly from anthropogenic sources, also increased from fall onwards. Organic carbon (OC) was the main species of carbonaceous content of PM2.5 in all seasons, and OC/EC ratios increased during the seasons with prevailing northeastern winds. Anhydrosugar, concentrations in winter and spring were generally higher than those in summer and fall, indicating significant biomass burning occurring in winter and spring. Correlation analysis showed a high correlation between PM2.5 concentrations and chemical composition between two subtropical islands. The correlation of chemical composition for different transportation routes revealed that northern routes had a higher correction than southern routes.

 Urban heat island effect and local atmospheric boundary layer circulation caused by urbanization are important factors affecting the transport and spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric particulate matter in cities and surrounding areas. To analyze the local atmospheric circulation and its influence on the temporal and spatial characteristics of PM2.5 concentration over the Central Liaoning Urban Agglomeration, a heavy haze process was selected. The atmospheric chemistry model WRF-Chem was applied for numerical simulations with sensitivity experiments of urban canopy physical processes. The experiment case (EXP) was set up by coupling an improved urban canopy model with WRF-Chem, in which more details of inhomogeneous wind and diffusion in the complexed street canyon were fully and reasonably considered. Compared with the control case (CTR) by the original WRF-Chem, the deviation of the simulated and observed near-surface temperature and atmospheric boundary layer height was significantly improved in EXP: the error during the daytime was reduced from −1.30% and −48.39% in CTR to −0.78% and −33.68% in EXP, respectively, while during the nighttime it was reduced from −1.15% and −48.98% to 0.05% and −24.42%. The simulation accuracy of the near-surface PM2.5 concentration in EXP was also significantly higher: the deviation during the daytime was 18.24% in CTR and 3.28% in EXP, while it was reduced from 40.69% in CTR to 28.88% in EXP during the nighttime. Thus, the EXP improved significantly in meteorological simulation during the nighttime, and then particulate matter concentrations in EXP during the nighttime were obviously improved.

 The 2-m temperature data is a significant indicator for studying the weather extremes and the exchange of water and energy fluxes between the surface and atmosphere. This study compared three reanalysis datasets, i.e., ERA5, ERA5-Land, and MERRA-2, with observations from in-situ sources from 1990 to 2022 using various statistical error metrics and extreme temperature indices over the Arabian Peninsula (AP) region. We selected these reanalysis datasets due to the continuous improvements and higher spatiotemporal output better capturing the temperature variability. The spatiotemporal climatology shows lower temperatures in winter (<15 °C) and maximum in summer (>35 °C); however, the reanalysis data show more deviations in temperature during the cold season than in the warm season. The reanalysis data underestimated the frequency of the cold (<10 °C) and hot (>30 °C) days across the four regions, except ERA5-Land, which closely followed observed data. The strength of the correlation shows better performance (>0.90) in the cold extremes (cold nights and cold days) frequency than the hot extremes. On an interannual scale, reanalysis products exhibit strong correlations (>0.90) with in-situ data across most regions, particularly in winter and autumn, moderate in spring, and weaker in summer. The reanalysis data shows negative biases in the inland regions and positive biases in the coastal areas with consistent root mean square differences (RMSD) spatiotemporally. The differences in performance are due to the topography and poor representation of the energy fluxes, especially in MERRA-2 as well as missing data in observations. This study recommends ERA5-Land as the first choice for extreme weather simulations in the region, followed by MERRA-2 and ERA5 on the same scale, but proper attention is needed when using reanalysis data for cold and hot extremes."

However, the lack of extensive and large-scale geodetic networks near such seismic events hinders our thorough understanding of the large-scale crustal deformation resulting from earthquakes. Using Türkiye’s extensive and continuous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) network during the moment magnitude 7.8 and 7.6 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes on 6 February 2023, we show that large earthquakes can induce far-field crustal deformations (>700 kilometers), exceeding current predictions from elastic dislocation models. They can lead to the mobilization of tectonic plates and the triggering of far-field earthquakes, which carries profound implications for seismic hazard assessments and necessitates a new perspective on crustal deformation and earthquake mechanics."

We show that predator-prey contact can be established by gliding motility or extracellular assemblages we call “grappling hooks.” Cryo–electron microscopy identified the grappling hooks as heptamers of a type IX secretion system substrate. After close predator-prey contact is established, cryo–electron tomography and functional assays showed that puncturing by a type VI secretion system mediated killing. Single-cell analyses with stable isotope–labeled prey revealed that prey components are taken up by the attacker. Depending on nutrient availability, insertion sequence elements toggle the activity of ixotrophy. A marine metagenomic time series shows coupled dynamics of ixotrophic bacteria and prey. We found that the mechanism of ixotrophy involves multiple cellular machineries, is conserved, and may shape microbial populations in the environment."

We relate insect and spider richness to biomass and PUFA-mass from stream and terrestrial communities encompassing nine land uses. PUFA-mass and biomass relate positively to biodiversity across ecosystems. In terrestrial systems, human-dominated areas have lower biomass and PUFA-mass than more natural areas, even at equivalent levels of richness. Aquatic ecosystems have consistently higher PUFA-mass than terrestrial ecosystems.

We combined chemical analysis with a high-throughput in vitro assay for neurotoxicity to capture complex mixtures of organic chemicals in blood. Plasma samples of 624 pregnant women from the German LiNA cohort were extracted with a nonselective extraction method for organic chemicals. 294 of >1000 target analytes were detected and quantified. Many of the detected chemicals as well as the whole extracts interfered with neurite development.

Prior research on UHI and HW has predominantly concentrated on examining the thermal conditions at the surface and near-surface, with few investigations extending to the radiative and dynamical interactions of UHI and HW, particularly with a focus on the inhomogeneities across local climate zones (LCZs). Here, we analyse the temperature disparity between HW and non-HW conditions across LCZs in the Sydney area by quantifying the contributions of individual radiative and dynamical processes using the coupled surface-atmosphere climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM). Three moist HW events in 2017, 2019, and 2020 are simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM). It is found that the maximum surface and 900 hPa temperature difference between HW and non-HW days may reach up to 10 K, with the increased net solar radiation during HWs being comparable to the typical level of anthropogenic heat flux in urban areas. It is also found that the reduction of clouds, the presence of vapour, and the increase of sensible heat contribute to the warming effect to various degrees, with the contribution of clouds being the most dominant. Conversely, the generation of dry convection and the increase of latent heat flux lead to cooling effects, with the latter being more dominant and capable of causing up to 10 K surface temperature difference between LCZ1 (compact high-rise) and LCZ9 (sparsely built). The differences in the contributions of climate feedback processes across different LCZs become more evident during more severe and humid HWs.

Only in this way can the potential negative impacts of cattle related to local ecosystem degradation, as well as positive ones such as preserving cultural landscapes through grazing, be analyzed. While data on livestock distribution often used in scientific analyses can provide estimates on density, the separation between the livestock that has access to outdoor grazing and those that remain indoors is not available. This is problematic because it prevents the identification of the intensity and type of grassland management, as well as the consequential environmental impacts of grazing livestock. Here we present an approach where we combined agricultural and veterinary statistics, in-situ data, expert surveys and machine learning to develop a map of grazing cattle distribution for the wider European Union region. Our approach and the resulting data allow for the differentiation between cattle that are actually grazing versus those that do not. We also compare our method to traditional approaches that do not have a clear separation between grazing and non-grazing cattle, illustrating the implications that this can have for agricultural, land use and environmental assessments."

Rauber;Larry Di Girolamo,Evolution of cloud droplet temperature and lifetime in spatiotemporally varying subsaturated environments with implications for ice nucleation at cloud edges,"Cloud droplet temperature and lifetime impact cloud microphysical processes such as the activation of ice-nucleating particles. We investigate the thermal and radial evolution of supercooled cloud droplets and their surrounding environments with an aim to better understand observed enhanced ice formation at supercooled cloud edges. This analysis shows that the magnitude of droplet cooling during evaporation is greater than estimated from past studies, especially for drier environments. 
 Ice formation mechanisms in generating cells near stratiform cloud tops, where mixing and entrainment occurs in the presence of supercooled water droplets, remain poorly understood. Supercooled cloud droplet temperature and lifetime may impact heterogeneous ice nucleation through contact and immersion freezing; however, modeling studies normally assume the droplet temperature to be spatially uniform and equal to the ambient temperature. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind quantitative investigation of the temperature and lifetime of evaporating droplets, considering internal thermal gradients within the droplet, as well as thermal and vapor density gradients in the surrounding air. Our approach employs solving Navier–Stokes and continuity equations, coupled with heat and vapor transport, using an advanced numerical model. For typical ranges of cloud droplet sizes and environmental conditions, the droplet internal thermal gradients dissipate quickly (≤ 0.3 s) when droplets are introduced to new subsaturated environments. However, the magnitude of droplet cooling is much greater than estimated from past studies of droplet evaporation, especially for drier environments. For example, for an environment with 500 hPa pressure, and ambient temperature far from the droplet of −5 °C, the droplet temperature reduction can be as high as 24, 11, and 5 °C for initial ambient relative humidities of 10 %, 40 %, and 70 %, respectively. Droplet lifetimes are found to be tens of seconds longer compared to previous estimates, due to weaker evaporation rates because of lower droplet surface temperatures. Using these new end-of-lifetime droplet temperatures, the enhancement in the activation of ice-nucleating particles predicted by current ice nucleation parameterization schemes is discussed."

However, the occurrence of lightning activity in clouds is uncertain. In this study, we quantified the difference between isolated thunderstorms and non-thunderstorms. We showed that lightning activity was more likely to occur with more graupel volume and/or riming. A deeper ZDR column was associated with lightning occurrence.

 Determining whether a cloud will evolve into a thunderstorm is beneficial for understanding thunderstorm formation and also important for ensuring the safety of society. However, a clear understanding of the microphysics of clouds in terms of the occurrence of lightning activity has not been attained. Vast field observations and laboratory experiments indicate that graupel, which is rimed ice, is a vital hydrometeor for lightning generation and is the foundation of riming electrification. In this study, polarimetric radar and lightning observations are used to compare the ice microphysics associated with graupel between 57 isolated thunderstorms and 39 isolated non-thunderstorms, and the differences in radar parameters are quantified. Our results for the occurrence of lightning activity in clouds revealed the following results: (1) the maximum difference in graupel volume at the −10 °C isotherm height between thunderstorms and non-thunderstorms reached approximately 7.6 km3; (2) the graupel particles approached spherical shapes, with a mean differential reflectivity (ZDR) value of 0.3 dB, which likely indicated that heavily rimed graupel was present; (3) the median values of horizontal reflectivity (ZH) or ZDR at positions where the source initiation and channel of the first lightning flashes were nearly 31 dBZ or 0 dB; and (4) 98.2 % of the thunderstorms were equipped with a ZDR column, and the mean depth was ∼ 2.5 km.

The impacts of heatwaves and droughts can be made worse when they happen at the same time. Dheed is a global database of dry and hot compound extreme events from 1950 to 2022. It can be combined with other data to study the impacts of those events on terrestrial ecosystems, specific species or human societies. Dheed's analysis confirms that extremely dry and hot days have become more common on all continents in recent decades, especially in Europe and Africa. 
 The intensification of climate extremes is one of the most immediate effects of global climate change. Heatwaves and droughts have uneven impacts on ecosystems that can be exacerbated in case of compound events. To comprehensively study these events, e.g. with local high-resolution remote sensing or in-situ data, a global catalogue of such events is essential. Here, we propose a workflow to build a database of large-scale dry and hot extreme events based on data from ERA5 reanalysis. Drought indicators are constructed based on evapotranspiration and precipitation data averaged over 30, 90 and 180 days. Extreme events are detected with the peak-over-threshold approach for the 1950–2022 period. Extremes and non-extremes are defined for daily maximum temperature at 2 m in combination with three drought indicators. In the last step, the spatiotemporal extent of the events is computed by a connected component analysis. The identified events are validated against extreme events reported in the literature."

In-situ observation remains the best alternative for accurate characterization of trends and extremes in these shallow environments. This paper presents the coastal temperature dataset of the ReefTEMPS monitoring network which spreads over multiple Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTS) in the Western and Central South Pacific. 
 While the rise in global ocean temperature continues its course, reaching 1.45+/- 0.12 °C above pre-industrial level according to the World Meteorological Organization in 2023, marine heat waves frequencies and intensities increase. Consequently, coral reef ecosystems which are among the most vulnerable environments are strongly impacted with dystrophic events and corals experiencing increasing frequencies of bleaching events. That has devastating consequences for the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTS) that strongly rely on these ecosystems. In-situ observation remains the best alternative for providing accurate characterization of long-term trends and extremes in these shallow environments. This paper presents the coastal temperature dataset of the ReefTEMPS monitoring network in which moored stations are implemented over a number of PICTS over a wide region in the Western and Central South Pacific from New Caledonia to French Polynesia. These in situ temperature time series are unique in several ways: in the length of some historical stations dating back to 1958 for the oldest, thus providing more than 65 years of daily data; in the number of countries sampled (16 PICTS) ; and in the variety of coral ecosystems monitored (from atolls to high islands and from barrier reef’s external slopes to shallow and narrow lagoons). Measurement devices have evolved over the years to provide increasingly precise and frequent observations so that the ReefTEMPS network was endorsed as a French National Observation Service in 2020, a label ensuring quality controlled and open access data of long-term observations. All stations are publicly available in ASCII or formatted NetCDF files, either on the ReefTEMPS dedicated Information System which also allows quick visualisation of time series, or in the SEANOE marine data platform. All links and accesses to these temperature time series are provided herein. The quality control and longevity of these temperature time series allows diagnosing long-term trends, highlighting the influence of multiple processes on temperature dynamics (e.g., internal waves, cyclones, seasonal and climate modes) and documenting the time evolution of extreme events.

The WCODA system improves simulations of ocean temperature and salinity across many global regions. It also enhances the simulation of interannual precipitation and temperature variability over the southern US. This system is to support future predictability studies. 
 The development, implementation, and evaluation of a new weakly coupled ocean data assimilation (WCODA) system for the fully coupled Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) utilizing the four-dimensional ensemble variational (4DEnVar) method are presented in this study. The 4DEnVar method, based on the dimension-reduced projection four-dimensional variational (DRP-4DVar) approach, replaces the adjoint model with the ensemble technique, thereby reducing computational demands. Monthly mean ocean temperature and salinity data from the EN4.2.1 reanalysis are integrated into the ocean component of E3SMv2 from 1950 to 2021, with the goal of providing realistic initial conditions for decadal predictions and predictability studies. The performance of the WCODA system is assessed using various metrics, including cost function reduction, root mean square error (RMSE) differences, correlation differences, and model biases. Results indicate that the WCODA system effectively assimilates the reanalysis data into the climate model, achieving consistently negative cost function reductions and notable improvements in RMSE and correlation across various ocean layers and regions. Significant enhancements are observed in the majority of global ocean regions, particularly in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Indian Ocean. Model biases in sea surface temperature and salinity are also substantially reduced. Furthermore, analysis of the connections between the ocean states and the regional climate over the US shows that the WCODA system improves the simulation of interannual precipitation and temperature variability over the southern US. The ultimate goal of the WCODA system is to advance the predictive capabilities of E3SM for subseasonal-to-decadal climate predictions, thereby supporting research on strategic energy-sector policies and planning."

This study investigated the adsorption performance of LDHs for removing 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP). CaFe-LDH presented a specific adsorption behavior and ultrahigh adsorption capacity for HEDP, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 335.7 mg P/g (1116.5 mg HEDP/g) at pH 7.0. X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrated that HEDP adsorption induced a structural transformation of CaFe-LDH from a layered configuration to a highly ordered structure, leading to a noticeable phase transition. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and Raman spectroscopy further confirmed that two distinct binding modes of HEDP, relating to chelation with Ca2+ and adsorption on Fe3+ simultaneously, are connected by phosphonic acid groups (−C–PO(OH)2), forming the CaFe-HEDP complex. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the CaFe-HEDP ternary complex exhibits a highly ordered arrangement in an oxygen-bridged framework. The construction of an oxygen-coordinated framework contributes to the incorporation of more HEDP into CaFe-LDH, leading to a well-aligned lattice in the new phase.

However, the coexisting high-concentration chloride ions in wastewater can exert a significant influence on nitrate reduction due to the competitive adsorption and corrosion of Cl– on photocatalysts. Herein, we prepared ethylene glycol-Cu/TiO2–x (EG-Cu/TiO2–x) through a solvothermal reaction of Cu-doped TiO2 in an EG solution. The photodegradation of nitrate using EG-Cu/TiO2–x without adding sacrificial agents can efficiently occur in near-neutral pH solutions containing 50 mM Cl– with 95.26% of NO3– removal and 76.52% of N2 selectivity. Moreover, the photocatalyst performance remained at a high level after 8 cycles. In this work, NO3– was first converted to NH4+ by Cu0 and Ti3+, followed by the NH4+-to-N2 conversion by photogenerated chlorine free radicals. Compared to HO•, Cl•, and Cl2•–, ClO• is proved to play the predominant role in transforming NH4+ to N2. The EG radicals produced by UV light impede Cl– adsorption on Cu, protecting Cu0 from being corroded. What’s more, photoelectrons can reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and protect Cu0 from being oxidized, enabling the stability of reactive sites. This work provides novel insights and understanding on designing photocatalysts for NO3– removal in solutions containing chloride ions, highlighting the significance of eliminating Cl– by EG radicals and adjusting the conversion process of NO3– for the efficient removal of NO3–."

Two additional mesocosms with no added microplastics were used as controls. Zooplankton ingested low levels of microplastics (mean of 0.06 particles/individual ± SD 0.07) and generally their total abundance and community composition were not negatively impacted. Temporary changes were however observed; total zooplankton abundance and abundance of calanoid copepods were temporarily stimulated by increasing nominal microplastic concentrations, and modest, short-term reductions in egg production of the cyclopoid copepod Tropocyclops extensus and abundance of copepod nauplii occurred. Collectively, these results suggest that microplastics could have complex impacts on zooplankton communities, stimulating some species while negatively impacting others."

The simulated frequency of consecutive pIOD increases by 131.3% over 1950–2100. More than 65% pIOD will manifest as consecutive pIOD events in the second half of this century. The increase in consecutive pIOD is dominated by the rise in mixed consecutive pIOD that contains both ENSO‐pIOD and independent pIOD. Mixed consecutive pIOD that start with ENSO‐pIOD increases fastest among all types of consecutive pIOD events. The increase is contributed by three factors: higher ENSO‐pIOD frequency, weaker biennial component of ENSO forcing, and more active pIOD triggers that are independent from ENSO.

Results show that the threshold concentration of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2) required for deglaciation can vary from 6 to 10 × 104 ppmv under different orbital forcings. The threshold pCO2 decreases with the equatorial maximum monthly insolation (EMMI), which is affected most by the eccentricity and secondarily by obliquity. Therefore, we conclude that the snowball Earth deglaciation likely occurred when the eccentricity was high and obliquity was low. Compared to previous estimate that used present‐day orbital configuration which has a minimal eccentricity, the duration of snowball Earth events would likely be much shorter when the influence of orbital variations are considered."

However, many sounding measurements may lack laterally extensive features that would aid their physical interpretation. In this scenario, the detection of sparse echoes can also provide rich information on ice shell properties. To explore and demonstrate this possibility, we consider three cases of isolated radar signatures: pore‐curing, eutectic melt, and unattributed echoes. We show that through detection of unattributed sparse echoes, the thickness of the conductive portion of Europa's ice shell can be constrained. These constraints can be improved by attributing sparse echoes to thermally diagnostic signatures such as pore‐curing and eutectic melt.

 The Earth’s mantle is divided by the circum-Pacific subduction girdle into the African and Pacific domains, each featuring a large low-shear-wave-velocity province (LLSVP) in the lower mantle. However, how this hemispherical-scale mantle structure links to Earth’s plate tectonic evolution remains unclear. Previous geochemical work has suggested the presence of a north–south hemispheric subdivision, with large-scale mantle heterogeneities in the Southern Hemisphere, termed the DUPAL (Dupré and Allegre) anomaly. Here we compile elemental and isotopic data of both shallow-mantle-derived oceanic igneous rocks from mid-ocean ridges and deeper-mantle plume-related samples (ocean islands and oceanic plateaus) and analyse these using supervised machine learning classification methods. Data from both shallow- and deeper-mantle-sourced samples illustrate a consistent chemical dichotomy. Our results indicate that heterogeneities in the present-day shallow and deep mantle are not exclusively controlled by the north–south hemispheric DUPAL anomaly. Instead, they are consistent with a chemical dichotomy between the African and Pacific mantle domains and their associated LLSVPs. These observations can best be explained by tectonic supercycles over the past one billion years involving two supercontinents and two superoceans.

Here the authors show, using genetic mouse models and functional analyses, that Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism is important for regulating monocyte homeostasis and migration, but curiously has no impact on atherosclerotic plaque formation. 
 Monocytes directly contribute to atherosclerosis development by their recruitment to plaques in which they differentiate into macrophages. In the present study, we ask how modulating monocyte glucose metabolism could affect their homeostasis and their impact on atherosclerosis. Here we investigate how circulating metabolites control monocyte behavior in blood, bone marrow and peripheral tissues of mice. We find that serum glucose concentrations correlate with monocyte numbers. In diet-restricted mice, monocytes fail to metabolically reprogram from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, leading to reduced monocyte numbers in the blood. Mechanistically, Glut1-dependent glucose metabolism helps maintain CD115 membrane expression on monocytes and their progenitors, and regulates monocyte migratory capacity by modulating CCR2 expression. Results from genetic models and pharmacological inhibitors further depict the relative contribution of different metabolic pathways to the regulation of CD115 and CCR2 expression. Meanwhile, Glut1 inhibition does not impact atherosclerotic plaque development in mouse models despite dramatically reducing blood monocyte numbers, potentially due to the remaining monocytes having increased migratory capacity. Together, these data emphasize the role of glucose uptake and intracellular glucose metabolism in controlling monocyte homeostasis and functions. Monocytes participate in plaque formation, and adapt to metabolic changes to alter their functions. Here the authors show, using genetic mouse models and functional analyses, that Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism is important for regulating monocyte homeostasis and migration, but curiously has no impact on atherosclerotic plaque formation."

Here, the authors show that a proteomic signature can help identify patients who may benefit from a restrictive fluid strategy, potentially reducing hospital mortality rates. 
 Fluid management remains a critical challenge in the treatment of septic shock, with individualized approaches lacking. This study aims to develop a statistical model based on transcriptomics to identify subgroups of septic shock patients with varied responses to fluid strategy. The study encompasses 494 septic shock patients. A benefit score is derived from the transcriptome space, with higher values indicating greater benefits from restrictive fluid strategy. Adherence to the recommended strategy is associated with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.64–0.92). When applied to the baseline hospital mortality rate of 16%, adherence to the recommended fluid strategy could potentially lower this rate to 13%. A proteomic signature comprising six proteins is developed to predict the benefit score, yielding an area under the curve of 0.802 (95% confidence interval: 0.752–0.846) in classifying patients who may benefit from a restrictive strategy. In this work, we develop a proteomic signature with potential utility in guiding fluid strategy for septic shock patients.

 Despite the growing variety of sequencing and variant-calling tools, no workflow performs equally well across the entire human genome. Understanding context-dependent performance is critical for enabling researchers, clinicians, and developers to make informed tradeoffs when selecting sequencing hardware and software. Here we describe a set of “stratifications,” which are BED files that define distinct contexts throughout the genome. We define these for GRCh37/38 as well as the new T2T-CHM13 reference, adding many new hard-to-sequence regions which are critical for understanding performance as the field progresses. Specifically, we highlight the increase in hard-to-map and GC-rich stratifications in CHM13 relative to the previous references. We then compare the benchmarking performance with each reference and show the performance penalty brought about by these additional difficult regions in CHM13. Additionally, we demonstrate how the stratifications can track context-specific improvements over different platform iterations, using Oxford Nanopore Technologies as an example.

 Edge states in topological systems have attracted great interest due to their robustness and linear dispersions. Here a superconducting-proximitized edge interferometer is engineered on a topological insulator Ta2Pd3Te5 with asymmetric edges to realize the interfering Josephson diode effect (JDE), which hosts many advantages, such as the high efficiency as much as 73% at tiny applied magnetic fields with an ultra-low switching power around picowatt. As an important element to induce such JDE, the second-order harmonic in the current-phase relation is also experimentally confirmed by half-integer Shapiro steps. The interfering JDE is also accompanied by the antisymmetric second harmonic transport, which indicates the corresponding asymmetry in the interferometer, as well as the polarity of JDE. This edge interferometer offers an effective method to enhance the performance of JDE, and boosts great potential applications for future superconducting quantum devices.

 Protein aggregation plays key roles in age-related degenerative diseases, but how different proteins coalesce to form inclusions that vary in composition, morphology, molecular dynamics and confer physiological consequences is poorly understood. Here we employ a general reporter based on mutant Hsp104 to identify proteins forming aggregates in human cells under common proteotoxic stress. We identify over 300 proteins that form different inclusions containing subsets of aggregating proteins. In particular, TDP43, implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), partitions dynamically between two distinct types of aggregates: stress granule and a previously unknown non-dynamic (solid-like) inclusion at the ER exit sites (ERES). TDP43-ERES co-aggregation is induced by diverse proteotoxic stresses and observed in the motor neurons of ALS patients. Such aggregation causes retention of secretory cargos at ERES and therefore delays ER-to-Golgi transport, providing a link between TDP43 aggregation and compromised cellular function in ALS patients.

Here, the authors show that centenarians carry fewer harmful loss-of-function mutations and identify genes that may contribute to extreme longevity and healthy aging 
 While previous studies identified common genetic variants associated with longevity in centenarians, the role of the rare loss-of-function (LOF) mutation burden remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the burden of rare LOF mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals from the Longevity Genes Project and LonGenity study cohorts using whole-exome sequencing data. We found that centenarians had a significantly lower burden (11-22%) of LOF mutations compared to controls. Similar effects were also observed in their offspring. Gene-level burden analysis identified 35 genes with depleted LOF mutations in centenarians, with 14 of these validated in the UK Biobank. Mendelian randomization and multi-omic analyses on these genes identified RGP1, PCNX2, and ANO9 as longevity genes with consistent causal effects on multiple aging-related traits and altered expression during aging. Our findings suggest that a protective genetic background, characterized by a reduced burden of damaging variants, contributes to exceptional longevity, likely acting in concert with specific protective variants to promote healthy aging.

Nonetheless, endorsement of climate justice beliefs was widespread (for example, acknowledging the disproportionate impact of climate change on poor people and the underpinning roles of capitalism and colonialism in the climate crisis).

 Land cover change detection and classification, including both inter-class changes (land cover conversion, LCC) and intra-class changes (land cover modification, LCM), is critical for understanding the Earth’s dynamic processes and promoting sustainability. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on LCC, with less emphasis on LCM. Land cover classification remains challenging, and its mapping results are often affected by salt and pepper noise. Here, we propose a hybrid approach for continuous change detection and classification of LCC and LCM using Jinchang City, China, as a case study. Firstly, we combined the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) and the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST) algorithms to identify LCC and LCM using all available Landsat time series (TS) data from 2000 to 2020. Then, the harmonic regression coefficients and RMSE values derived from CCDC (hereafter called CCDC features) were fed into the DCNN model for LCC classification. Our findings indicate: (1) For LCC and LCM accuracy assessment, the CCDC and BEAST ensemble achieved a spatial F1 score of 82.7% and an average temporal F1 score of 79.7%. (2) In LCC classification, the DCNN model with CCDC features, particularly DeepLabV3+, outperformed the pixel-based XGBoost and other multi-year land cover products, with frequency-weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), overall accuracy, and Kappa scores of 88.7%, 94%, and 0.87, respectively.

 Low scattering terrain areas introduce complex phase interference, which reduces the accuracy of deformation signal estimation in InSAR(Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) techniques. Existing covariance matrix-based InSAR phase calculation methods often fail to account for translational offset relations between scatterers leading to inaccuracies, and pixels with zero spatial coherence exist. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed scatterer InSAR phase estimation method based on the Cross-Correlation complex coherence matrix. The effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm are verified through simulation and actual data. The results show that: (i) The simulation analysis shows that, compared to the traditional covariance matrix method, the optimal Cross-Correlation matrix improves the interferometric phase, coherence, and accuracy by 21.51%, 15.24%, and 6.52%, respectively. (ii) The actual experimental data show that the interferometric phase optimal by the Cross-Correlation matrix can effectively overcome the pseudo-signal caused by spatial hopping and make the phase more continuous. Compared with the traditional covariance matrix, the average a posteriori coherence and average coherence of arbitrary interference combinations in the Cross-Correlation matrix are improved by 18.12% and 58.10%, respectively. (iii) The number of DS points selected by the Cross-Correlation matrix algorithm is more than that of the covariance matrix algorithm. PS-InSAR (Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) achieved more accurate deformation rates compared to the covariance and correlation matrices, with errors of 9.34, 17.21, and 16.28 mm∙a-1 when compared against GNSS data, respectively.

 Effective management of corn straw and stubble is critical in conservation tillage, as it impacts soil health and productivity. However, accurate classification of different types of straw cover has been hindered by their similar spectral and spatial characteristics and the low spatial resolution of hyperspectral satellite imagery. Moreover, traditional convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods, which rely on first-order statistics for feature extraction, often struggle to extract distinguishable features of highly similar objects effectively, thereby reducing classification accuracy. In this study, a second-order statistical-feature extraction algorithm based on CNN that uses fused multispectral and hyperspectral data was tested for its ability to classify types of straw cover. In the first step, coupled non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) was used to fuse hyperspectral and multispectral images effectively, thereby enhancing the spatial resolution of the hyperspectral data. In this study, we integrated pointwise convolution (PWC), depthwise convolution (DWC), and a distance covariance matrix (DCM) to form a mixed convolution and DCM (MCDCM) network; we used this to extract and integrate deep spectral–spatial features of the hyperspectral images. Our experimental results show that the MCDCM network significantly improved classification accuracy compared to traditional methods, with accuracy rates for the different straw-cover types exceeding 90% and overall accuracy reaching 98.26%. The fused image also exhibited better preservation of feature edges and contours. The accurate identification of corn-straw-cover types achieved with the proposed MCDCM method is a major step in optimizing conservation-farming practices, improving soil fertility and farm productivity, and supporting sustainable ecological development."

 Automated Aerial Triangulation (AAT), aiming to restore image poses and reconstruct sparse points simultaneously, plays a pivotal role in earth observation. AAT has evolved into a fundamental process widely applied in large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based mapping. However classic AAT methods still face challenges like low efficiency and limited robustness. This paper introduces DeepAAT, a deep learning network designed specifically for AAT of UAV imagery. DeepAAT considers both spatial and spectral characteristics of imagery, enhancing its capability to resolve erroneous matching pairs and accurately predict image poses. DeepAAT marks a significant leap in AAT’s efficiency, ensuring thorough scene coverage and precision. Its processing speed outpaces incremental AAT methods by hundreds of times and global AAT methods by tens of times while maintaining a comparable level of reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, DeepAAT’s scene clustering and merging strategy facilitate rapid localization and pose determination for large-scale UAV images, even under constrained computing resources. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepAAT substantially improves over conventional AAT methods, highlighting its potential for increased efficiency and accuracy in UAV-based 3D reconstruction tasks. To benefit the photogrammetry society, the code of DeepAAT will be released at: https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/DeepAAT."

 Effective geographic environment observation planning is the key to obtain disaster monitoring and warning information. The previous researches can only make observation plans for a single disaster at some specific stages. They are difficult to apply to the dynamic evolution of the disaster chain. Timely and comprehensive geographic environment observation planning is urgently needed to provide high-value monitoring data for the identification and response of secondary disaster chains. Event logic graph (ELG) shows great potential in evolutionary law expression and chain event reasoning. Therefore, this study proposed an observation ELG (OELG), in which events and their logical relationships are modeled as nodes and edges to express the occurrence and development motivation of observation events. The disaster chain observation planning can be transformed into the reasoning of potential continuous observation events. Subsequently, an OELG-based geographic environment observation planning framework was proposed, which realizes the construction, instantiation, and plan reasoning of OELG. The observation planning experiment was carried out taking the flood disaster chain that occurred in Beijing, China and Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany as examples. The results show that OELG can generate disaster chain observation plan more timely, comprehensively, and continuously than other models, thus providing support for disaster chain risk monitoring and emergency response."

 Global climate models (GCMs) serve as essential tools for projecting future climate trends, but their coarse resolution limits localized impact assessments in sectors like hydrology, agriculture, and biodiversity. Observation data with a spatial resolution of a few kilometers are crucial for downscaling and bias-correcting GCMs at finer resolutions. However, Nepal's extreme topography and organizational challenges have led to uneven distribution of meteorological stations and inconsistent data quality. Moreover, CMIP6-based climate extremes projections for the entire country are currently unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we developed a comprehensive national database for Nepal, offering high-resolution historical and projected precipitation and temperature data analyzed through 25 climate extreme indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Initially, observation grid data were prepared at a daily timescale with a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05° for baseline period (1981–2010) using the Asian Precipitation High-Resolved Observational Data Integration Toward Evaluation (APHRODITE), the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (ERA5), and available good quality observed climate data. This data was then utilized to downscale and bias-correct 18 CMIP6 GCMs for 2015–2100 under four SSPs (1–2.6, 2–4.5, 3–7.0, 5–8.5). Quantile mapping was employed for the bias correction of the CMIP6 GCMs. The performance of the multimodal ensemble (MME) indicated better Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), root mean square error ratio (RSR), and Percent Bias (PBIAS) of climate extreme indices for the historical period. A comparative analysis was conducted across Nepal's major geographic regions to account for spatial variability in regional climate systems. The finer-resolution dataset can be crucial to deepen our understanding of climate impacts, and climate change, and eventually informing the policy-making in Nepal. Moreover, the methodology can be effectively replicated in data-scarce developing nations to promote climate research and adaptation efforts."

The reorganization of activity is so profound that decoding of sound representation under anesthesia is not possible based on awake activity. However, population-level parameters, such as average tuning strength and population decoding accuracy, are weakly affected by anesthesia, explaining why its effect has previously gone unnoticed when comparing independently sampled neurons. Together, our results indicate that the functional organization of the auditory brainstem largely depends on the network state and is ill-defined under anesthesia.

The catalysts exhibit enhanced MEA stability with 50% less Fe loss while maintaining high catalytic activity comparable to that in half-cells.

Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition and climate change may, however, limit the competitive advantage of nitrogen-fixing plants, leading to reduced relative diversity of nitrogen-fixing plants. Yet, assessments of changes of nitrogen-fixing plant long-term community diversity are rare. Here, we examine temporal trends in the diversity of nitrogen-fixing plants and their relationships with anthropogenic nitrogen deposition while accounting for changes in temperature and aridity. We used forest-floor vegetation resurveys of temperate forests in Europe and the United States spanning multiple decades. Nitrogen-fixer richness declined as nitrogen deposition increased over time but did not respond to changes in climate. Phylogenetic diversity also declined, as distinct lineages of N-fixers were lost between surveys, but the “winners” and “losers” among nitrogen-fixing lineages varied among study sites, suggesting that losses are context dependent. Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition reduces nitrogen-fixing plant diversity in ways that may strongly affect natural nitrogen fixation."

Human pluripotent stem cells are differentiated into transplantable dopamine (DA) progenitors which are proliferative at the time of grafting and undergo terminal differentiation and maturation in vivo. While the progenitors are homogeneous at the time of transplantation, they give rise to heterogeneous grafts composed not only of therapeutic DA neurons but also of other mature cell types. The mechanisms for graft diversification are unclear. We used single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to profile DA progenitors before transplantation combined with molecular barcode-based tracing to determine origin and shared lineages of the mature cell types in the grafts. Our data demonstrate that astrocytes, vascular leptomeningeal cells, and DA neurons are the main component of the DAergic grafts, originating from a common progenitor that is tripotent at the time of transplantation."

Nonetheless, the necessity of the main astrocyte glucose transporter, i.e., GLUT1, for brain glucose metabolism has not been defined. Unexpectedly, we found that brain glucose metabolism was paradoxically augmented in mice with astrocytic GLUT1 reduction (GLUT1ΔGFAPmice). These mice also exhibited improved peripheral glucose metabolism especially in obesity, rendering them metabolically healthier. Mechanistically, we observed that GLUT1-deficient astrocytes exhibited increased insulin receptor–dependent ATP release, and that both astrocyte insulin signaling and brain purinergic signaling are essential for improved brain function and systemic glucose metabolism. Collectively, we demonstrate that astrocytic GLUT1 is central to the regulation of brain energetics, yet its depletion triggers a reprogramming of brain metabolism sufficient to sustain energy requirements, peripheral glucose homeostasis, and cognitive function."

Investigated and presented are objective hierarchies, the aggregation of objectives, the curvature of the value functions, weights, and the introduction of a classification threshold. The MCDA-ACA method allows for the aggregation of hazards in such a way that poor performance in one hazard cannot be compensated for by good performance in another hazard. The method parameters were developed and tested using two data sets with the aim to classify chemical alternatives into acceptable (nonregrettable) and unacceptable (regrettable) alternatives according to the regulations set in Europe. The flexibility of the general method was explored by adapting the method to align with two hazard assessment schemes, Article 57 of REACH and GreenScreen.

Here, we found that logarithm (Ln)-transformed urinary As concentrations were negatively linearly related to the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score exposure–response curves. Subsequently, we identified a unique plasma neurometabolite profile in subjects exposed to As compared with the reference group. Further analyses showed that tryptophan, tyrosine, dopamine, epinephrine, and homovanillic acid were all significantly associated with both urinary As concentrations and MMSE scores.

Importantly, an unprecedented prediction model utilizing neurotransmitters was established to assess the risk of cognitive impairment due to As exposure. A 91.1% consistency rate was found between the predicted and the actual probabilities. Additionally, machine learning models also produced highly accurate predictions.

Chloramine did not similarly inhibit solder corrosion over the 4–9 month test duration, resulting in up to 100 times more lead contamination of the water relative to free chlorine.

Compared with the aerobic degradation of BDPs, their biodegradability under anaerobic conditions in environmental engineering systems remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the degradability of BDPs composed of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), poly(lactide acid) (PLA), and their blends, and explore the mechanism underlying their microbial degradation under conditions of anaerobic digestion (AD). The BDPs readily depolymerized under thermophilic conditions but were hydrolyzed at a slow rate under conditions of mesophilic AD. After 45 days of thermophilic AD, a decrease in the molecular weight and significant increase in the production of methane and carbon dioxide production were observed. Network and metagenomics analyses identified AD as reservoirs of plastic-degrading bacteria that produce multiple plastic-degrading enzymes. PETase was identified as the most abundant plastic-degrading enzyme. A potential pathway for the anaerobic biodegradation of BDPs was proposed herein. The polymers of high molecular weight were subjected to abiotic hydrolysis to form oligomers and monomers, enabling subsequent microbial hydrolysis and acetogenesis. Ultimately, complete degradation was achieved predominantly via the pathway involved in the conversion of acetic acid to methane. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanism underlying the anaerobic degradation of BDPs and the microbial resources crucial for the efficient degradation of BDPs."

While shorter-chain bis-FASIs such as NTf2 (aka bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide or bistriflimide) are often tied to the battery and energy sectors, aqueous film-forming foams may be potential sources of longer-chain bis-FASIs. As remediation technologies for the destruction of these persistent per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are urgently needed but have not yet been identified, we investigated the effectiveness of incineration using quantum chemical calculations. At temperatures of around 600 °C, the parent bis-FASIs readily decompose through carbon–sulfur bond cleavage and to a minor extent through nitrogen–sulfur bond cleavage. However, mineralization of the released perfluoroalkyl substituent to HF and CO2 only proceeds at >900 °C. Temperature requirements slightly increase with perfluoroalkyl chain length due to the time required to break additional C–C bonds. Under conditions and temperatures ≥1000 °C typical for secondary combustion units in hazardous waste incinerators, complete thermal destruction of bis-FASIs is viable given all other process variables are optimized.

A better understanding of the Henry’s volatility coefficients of these compounds is needed to estimate the gas-phase partitioning of these compounds from the amine solvent and to aid in the development of proper mitigation strategies that can be implemented within CO2 capture systems. This work highlights the experimental determination of the dimensionless Henry’s volatility coefficient of acetaldehyde from unloaded and CO2 loaded amine solvents using headspace solid-phase microextraction with on-fiber derivatization and gas chromatography mass spectrometry detection. The experimental dimensionless Henry’s volatility coefficient was significantly higher from the amine solvent when compared to acetaldehyde’s partitioning coefficient from water due to a “salting out” effect from increases in ionic strength with CO2 loaded amine solutions. A linear temperature and CO2 loading dependency of the Henry’s volatility coefficient was observed with acetaldehyde from the amine solvent. The experimental Henry’s coefficient was then used to estimate gas-phase concentrations from carbon capture systems based on measured process temperatures, CO2 loading in the solvent, and acetaldehyde liquid concentration values all measured from a pilot CO2 capture system."

 The ocean has experienced substantial oxygen loss over recent decades, affecting marine ecosystems and fisheries. Investigating ocean deoxygenation during hyperthermal events, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), offers insights into its future dynamics. Here, sediment cores from the South Atlantic reveal a pronounced decline in foraminifera-bound δ15N, concurrent with an increase in marine barite δ34S and enhanced ocean productivity during the PETM. These findings suggest an expansion of oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) from suboxia to anoxia in the thermocline, with ammonium and sulfide accumulation. Model simulations indicate “ammonium-type” ODZs were driven by Southern Ocean warming and elevated productivity. Intense fixed nitrogen loss at the upper boundary of these ODZs, along with increased oceanic phosphorus inventory, likely spurred a compensatory rise in N2 fixation. While the Pacific might experience different oxygenation conditions during the PETM, parts of the Atlantic thermocline became anoxic, highlighting potential spatial variabilities of ocean deoxygenation under global warming.

Here the authors identify a subset of iron-loaded cancer-associated fibroblasts secreting myeloid cell-associated proteins and driving immunosuppression in PCa. 
 Iron is an essential biomineral in the human body. Here, we describe a subset of iron-loaded cancer-associated fibroblasts, termed as FerroCAFs, that utilize iron to induce immunosuppression in prostate cancer and predict an unfavorable clinical outcome. FerroCAFs secrete myeloid cell-associated proteins, including CCL2, CSF1 and CXCL1, to recruit immunosuppressive myeloid cells. We report the presence of FerroCAFs in prostate cancer from both mice and human, as well as in human lung and ovarian cancers, and identify a conserved cell surface marker, the poliovirus receptor. Mechanistically, the accumulated iron in FerroCAFs is caused by Hmox1-mediated iron release from heme degradation. The intracellular iron activates the Kdm6b, an iron-dependent epigenetic enzyme, to induce an accessible chromatin state and transcription of myeloid cell-associated protein genes. Targeting the FerroCAFs by inhibiting the Hmox1/iron/Kdm6b signaling axis incurs anti-tumor immunity and tumor suppression. Collectively, we report an iron-loaded FerroCAF cluster that drives immunosuppression through an iron-dependent epigenetic reprogramming mechanism and reveal promising therapeutic targets to boost anti-tumor immunity.

Here, the authors discovered that phosphorylation of IGF2BP1 in disordered linkers regulates its assembly into ribonucleoprotein granules and impacts metabolism of its target RNAs. 
 The insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a conserved RNA-binding protein that regulates RNA stability, localization and translation. IGF2BP1 is part of various ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates. However, the mechanism that regulates its assembly into condensates remains unknown. By using proteomics, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of IGF2BP1 at S181 in a disordered linker is regulated in a stress-dependent manner. Phosphomimetic mutations in two disordered linkers, S181E and Y396E, modulate RNP condensate formation by IGF2BP1 without impacting its binding affinity for RNA. Intriguingly, the S181E mutant, which lies in linker 1, impairs IGF2BP1 condensate formation in vitro and in cells, whereas a Y396E mutant in the second linker increases condensate size and dynamics. Structural approaches show that the first linker binds RNAs nonspecifically through its RGG/RG motif, an interaction weakened in the S181E mutant. Notably, linker 2 interacts with IGF2BP1’s folded domains and these interactions are partially impaired in the Y396E mutant. Importantly, the phosphomimetic mutants impact IGF2BP1’s interaction with RNAs and remodel the transcriptome in cells. Our data reveal how phosphorylation modulates low-affinity interaction networks in disordered linkers to regulate RNP condensate formation and RNA metabolism. How phosphorylation regulates the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 remained largely unclear.

 The low cultivability of environmental bacteria has been widely acknowledged, but most previous estimates focused on the proportion of cultivable cells rather than cultivable taxa. Here, we estimate the proportions of cultivable cells and cultivable taxa for two sample types (soil and activated sludge) using cell counting, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and cultivation on agar plates under various conditions. We find that the proportion of cultivable taxa exceeds that of cultivable cells at the sample level. A large proportion of cultivable taxa are taxonomically novel but tend to be present at very low abundance on agar plates, forming microcolonies, and some of them cease to grow during subculture. Compared with uncultivable taxa (under the conditions used in our study), cultivatable taxa tend to display higher metabolic activity as inferred by measuring rRNA copies per cell. Finally, we use the generated taxonomic and genomic information as a guide to isolate a strain representing a yet-uncultured class within the Bacteroidota and to enhance the cultivable diversity of Burkholderiales from activated sludge.

 Impact ionization effect has been demonstrated in transistors to enable sub-60 mV dec−1 subthreshold swing.

 Coastal urbanization is a key driver of mangrove loss, yet its global impacts on mangroves have yet to be thoroughly understood. Here we present a fine-scale assessment of the hidden impacts of urbanization on mangroves mediated by climate, and the joint effects of urbanization and climate at the global scale. Surprisingly, both urbanization and climate had positive impacts on mangrove growth and carbon stock in some regions, which is different from the general belief of the adverse impacts from previous research. In total, 27.3% of global mangroves received positive impacts from urbanization regarding their extent and carbon stock, among which 59.5% are indirectly mediated by climate. Moreover, mangroves in subtropical/temperate climate zones experienced more indirect positive impacts from urbanization, which enhances local climate conditions for growth by altering temperature, rainfall and sea levels. These findings suggest the feasibility of facilitating mangrove conservation through effective urban planning to achieve coastal sustainability.

 Atmospheric rivers are important transport vehicles for Earth’s water cycle. Using a high-resolution, eddy-resolving Earth System Model, atmospheric river impacts on the upper ocean are investigated by analyzing historical and climate change simulations. For atmospheric rivers along the North American coastline, strong winds cause significant dynamic and thermodynamic upper ocean responses. They push ocean water towards the coast, measured by sea surface height, a process that is amplified under climate change. Mixed layers are deeper upstream of atmospheric rivers, and shallower downstream, however for climate change, shoaling downstream is subdued. Air-sea heat fluxes tend to promote ocean cooling upstream and warming downstream, although different regions have different climate change heat flux signals. Southern California heat flux changes due to warming are driven by evaporative processes and strengthen the ocean responses seen in historical simulations. The regions north are primarily dominated by sensible heat flux changes and counter the historical patterns.

This can be accomplished using the direct air capture of carbon dioxide, among other technologies. Process models of these systems assume that they would operate at standard ambient temperature and pressure, when capture rates vary with ambient conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, and other factors.

 Intertidal mudflats colonized by sediment-dwelling microphytobenthos deliver a wide range of ecosystem services. Here we simulate the response of microphytobenthos, located on a temperate tidal mudflat along the French Atlantic coast in Northwestern Europe, exposed to changes in light, temperature, and sea level conditions predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Without sea level rise, microphytobenthos benefit from the balancing effect of net primary production fluctuations, experiencing an increase in winter and a decrease in summer. Under the worst emissions scenario, microphytobenthos bloom up to 14 days earlier in spring and 5 days later in fall, thereby extending the low-level microphytobenthos biomass period by an additional 3 weeks in summer. Sea level rise reduces light exposure leading to a pronounced decline in microphytobenthos under the medium-low emissions and worst emissions scenarios. We provide evidence that the anticipated warmer climate and sea level rise will have an impact on microphytobenthos, potentially triggering cascading effects across the entire food web and disrupting ecosystem services.

In this study, we developed a method for attributing forest disturbance types using Dynamic World class probability data (i.e., probabilities for Dynamic World land use land cover types). Specifically, we first obtained a high-quality probability time series by pre-processing the class probability data. Then, we segmented the entire time series into several subseries and classified them according to the hypothetical trajectories.

We used the developed method to investigate the forest disturbance types in Myanmar from 2017 to 2023 and validated its effectiveness by conducting unbiased accuracy assessment. The overall accuracy of the type for the acquired map was approximately 93.3%, and the overall accuracy of the year was approximately 96.7%, proving that the method is feasible.

Here, testing of lignin content of nonpretreated biomass using the cellulolytic thermophilic bacterium,Anaerocellum bescii, revealed that the primary microbial degradation barrier relates to methoxy substitutions in lignin. This contrasts with optimal lignin composition for chemical pretreatment that favors high S/G ratio and low H lignin.

Unexpectedly, we find that wobble interactions exert a widespread effect on elongation pausing, with wobble-mediated decoding being slower than Watson-Crick decoding, irrespective of tRNA levels. Applying our ribosome pausing principles to ribosome collisions reveals that disomes arise upon apposition of fast-decoding and slow-decoding signatures. We conclude that codon choice and tRNA pools are evolutionarily constrained to harmonize elongation rate with cotranslational folding while minimizing wobble pairing and deleterious stalling."

The ability of airborne cells to survive and express genes may be limited by reduced water availability in the atmosphere and depend on the ability of the cells to attract water vapor at subsaturated conditions, i.e., their hygroscopicity. We assessed hygroscopic properties of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, known to participate in cloud formation. We used a hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer to examine both hydration and dehydration behavior in the relative humidity (RH) range 5–90%. The cells were aerosolized either from Milli-Q water or from a 35 g L–1 NaCl solution, resulting in pure cells or cells associated with NaCl. Pure cells exhibited no deliquescence/efflorescence and a small gradual water uptake reaching a maximum growth factor (GF) of 1.09 ± 0.01 at 90% RH. For cells associated with NaCl, we observed deliquescence and a much larger maximum GF of 1.74 ± 0.03 at 90% RH. Deliquescence RH was comparable to that of pure NaCl, highlighting the major role of the salt associated with the cells. It remains to be investigated how the observed hygroscopic properties relate to survival, metabolic, and ice-nucleation activities of airborne P. syringae."

As 1O2 is more tolerant to background constituents such as salt ions and a high pH value than •OH, tuning the production of 1O2 and •OH is important for efficient electro-Fenton degradation. However, it remains a great challenge to selectively produce 1O2 and improve the species yield. Herein, the electronic structure of atomically dispersed Cu–N4 sites was regulated by doping electron-deficient B into porous hollow carbon microspheres (CuBN-HCMs), which improved *O2 adsorption and significantly enhanced 1O2 selectivity in electro-Fenton degradation. Its 1O2 yield was 2.3 times higher than that of a Cu single-atom catalyst without B doping. Meanwhile, •OH was simultaneously generated as a minor species. The CuBN-HCMs were efficient for the electro-Fenton degradation of phenol, sulfamethoxazole, and bisphenol A with a high mineralization efficiency. Its kinetic constants showed insignificant changes under various anions and a wide pH range of 1–9. More importantly, it was energy-efficient for treating actual coking wastewater with a low energy consumption of 19.0 kWh kgCOD–1.

In the mid‐latitudes extreme precipitation events are strongly associated with cold fronts. By exploring drivers across different scales and relating them to precipitation, we aim to improve our understanding of processes influencing cold frontal extremes. Using hourly ERA5 data over Europe and the North Atlantic, cold fronts are detected and the associated conditions are identified. Quantile regression models are employed to find drivers of frontal precipitation and to quantify these relations. Additionally, we use composites to study the synoptic conditions and meso‐scale structure of extreme events. We find that humidity close to the detected fronts, convergence and the low level jet speed contribute most to the formation of extreme precipitation. Synoptic conditions favoring the formation of extreme events are also identified. These results improve our understanding of cold frontal processes leading to precipitation.

We present analytic, numerical, and experimental evidence demonstrating that this need not be so, and surface NMR signals can be retrieved even for absurdly long excitation pulses. We solve the Bloch equations in the limit of infinitely long excitation and use this result to demonstrate that a measurable magnetization can be obtained with long excitation pulses.

The Early Cenozoic sedimentary archives of Tibet are crucial for elucidating the geodynamic processes related to continental collision, particularly crustal deformation and shortening. However, the lack of a reliable chronostratigraphic framework for the Cenozoic sedimentary basins in central Tibet has hindered a comprehensive understanding of the influence of the continuous India‐Asia convergence process on the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan hinterland. Here, we report new magnetostratigraphic ages and paleomagnetic results for the Niubao Formation exposed in the northern bank of the Siling Co. Positive field tests and microscopic observations suggest that the remanence is primary. We determine that the depositional age of the measured section was between 59.2 and 48.6 Ma.

We investigate magnitude clustering in time across periods during, preceding and after macroscopic slip events on laboratory faults. Our findings reveal that magnitude clustering exists such that subsequent AEs tend to have more similar magnitudes than expected. Yet, this clustering only exists during macroscopic slip events and is strongest during major slip events in fluid‐saturated and dry samples. We demonstrate that robust magnitude clustering arises from variations in frequency‐magnitude distributions of AE events during macroscopic slip events. These temporal variations indicate a prevalence of larger AE events right after (0.3–3 s) the SS onset. Hence, magnitude clustering is a consequence of non‐stationarities."

In atmospheric models, stochastic generation of subgrid‐scale profiles or “subcolumns” has been used for a variety of purposes. Such subcolumns can be generated from subgrid probability density functions (PDFs) at different vertical levels, when such PDFs are available. To do so, the generator needs to decide how strongly points should be correlated in the vertical, that is, how much the values should be overlapped. This is sometimes called “PDF overlap.” To assess vertical correlation in a simplified, observable setting, here the vertical correlation of vertical velocity in subcloud layers is examined. Doppler lidar is used to evaluate the vertical profiles of vertical velocity produced by a large‐eddy simulation (LES) model and the Subgrid Importance Latin Hypercube Sampler (SILHS) subcolumn generator. In order to diagnose unrealistic features in subcolumn profiles, various statistical diagnostics are examined here, including the bivariate PDF of vertical velocity at two separated points (i.e., altitudes), the two‐point velocity correlation, the integral correlation length, the PDF of two‐point velocity differences, and the skewness and kurtosis of two‐point velocity differences. The profiles produced by LES match lidar well, except that they are too smooth at small scales. The profiles produced by SILHS exhibit sharp jumps from updraft to downdraft that are not observed in the lidar data. To reduce the generation of these unrealistically sharp jumps, the SILHS sampling method is revised. The diagnostics confirm that the revised sampling method reduces the overprediction of sharp jumps."

The energetics of cryoEM structures in lipid bilayers are congruent with the inferred mechanism from ATP turnover analysis and reveal a snapshot of a high-energy outward-facing conformation that provides an exit pathway into the lipid bilayer and/or the extracellular side.

 Recently, Autoencoders (AEs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection, owing to their powerful capability in handling high-dimensional data. However, they often overlook the inherent global distribution characteristics and long-range dependencies in hyperspectral images (HSI). This oversight makes it challenging to accurately characterize and describe boundaries between different backgrounds and anomalies in complex HSI, thereby affecting detection accuracy. To address this issue, a robust multi-stage progressive autoencoder for hyperspectral anomaly detection (RMSAD) is proposed. Initially, a progressive multi-stage learning framework based on convolutional autoencoders is employed. This framework incrementally reveals and integrates deep contextual features along with their long-range dependencies in HSI, aiming to accurately characterize the background and anomalies. Subsequently, an innovative multi-scale fusion strategy is introduced at the intersections of each stage, reinforcing the learning and representation of background and global spatial details across multiple stages. Finally, by collectively extracting abnormal spatial information across stages, effectively reducing the tendency of autoencoders to reconstruct anomalies. This ensures the efficient restoration and replication of global textural details in HSI. The experimental results on the six HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed RMSAD is superior to other state-of-the-art methods."

 Commercial districts, as the epicenters of urban commerce and economic activity, largely reflect an area’s prosperity through their customer flow. However, previous research, which often relied on statistical and survey data, has typically not captured the full scope of customer flow dynamics throughout urban commercial districts and has not adequately measured the specific impacts of business district locations and their surrounding communities on customer flow. To bridge these gaps, this study utilizes multidimensional big geo-data resources, including mobile phone signaling data, Points of Interest (POI) data, and transportation network data, to uncover the underlying factors that influence customer flow within urban commercial districts. The findings suggest that several factors—the size of the commercial district, the diversity of business formats, the convenience of parking, the working and residential population in surrounding communities, and the proximity to urban centers—significantly influence the customer flow. Consumers show a preference for larger-scale, centrally-located commercial districts that offer convenient parking options, while a homogenized and uncharacteristic business format may reduce a commercial district’s appeal. Furthermore, the study reveals that industrial parks and mixed-use complexes within the 15-minute living circle surrounding the commercial district have a stronger attraction to customer flow than residential neighborhoods do. The insights from this research not only guide the strategic placement of new commercial centers but also provide a robust framework for enhancing the layout of urban commercial spaces and for the revitalization and advancement of established commercial districts."

 Gaseous nitrous acid (HONO) plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, but there is still controversy regarding its sources. Recent studies have shown that soil can emit significant amounts of HONO. In order to further investigate the impact mechanism of soil HONO emissions and refine the estimation model of soil HONO emissions fluxes, this study employed a random forest model to estimate soil HONO emission fluxes and identified key influencing factors. By measuring in the laboratory and integrating global literature on soil HONO emissions, this study analyzed the characteristics of soil HONO emissions and their relationship with environmental factors. The results indicated that croplands emit significantly more HONO than other land use types. Furthermore, during wet-dry cycles, total soil HONO emissions showed a significant positive correlation with NO2− content and clay content, and also correlated significantly with maximum HONO emissions, total NO emissions, and maximum NO emissions (P < 0.001).

Here, we use artificial neural networks to correct the air-sea heat fluxes as a function of oceanic and atmospheric state predictors. The correction successfully improves surface and subsurface ocean temperatures beyond the training period and in prediction experiments. 
 The atmospheric forcing and the heat exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere represent one of the major sources of uncertainty for numerical ocean reconstructions and predictions. Air-sea heat fluxes may suffer from inaccuracies in meteorological fields, sea surface variables, and bulk formulations, which have a strongly non-linear dependence on the ocean state. Here, state-dependent errors of the heat fluxes are learned by artificial neural networks (ANN) from a dataset of heat flux correction terms, derived in turn from previous sea surface temperature nudging experiments. The pre-trained model predictors include stationary fields, atmospheric forcing data, ocean state, and stratification indices. Variable importance scores emphasize the dependence of the air-sea heat flux errors on the wind forcing. The pre-trained model of heat flux correction is then used to adaptively correct the fluxes online, in a series of global ocean experiments performed with the NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) ocean general circulation model, augmented with ANN inference capabilities. Results indicate the positive impact of the correction procedure, beyond the training period, e.g., in independent observation-poor and -rich periods, leading to the same dynamical and subsurface signature as in nudging experiments.

In this study, we introduce a rolling AI-based method for modeling global significant wave height. Our model achieves accuracy comparable to traditional numerical methods while significantly improving speed, making it operable on standard laptops. This work demonstrates AI's potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of global wave modeling. 
 Significant Wave Height (SWH) is crucial for many human activities, such as marine navigation, offshore operations, and coastal management. Traditionally, SWH is modeled using numerical wave models, which, while accurate, are computationally intensive and constrained by incomplete physical representations of wave spectral evolution. This study introduces a simple global deep learning-based model for SWH, which uses the current SWH field and the wind field at the next time step as inputs to predict the SWH field at the next time step. This approach mirrors the rolling prediction strategy of numerical wave models. After training on a re-analysis dataset, the errors of the model diverge lightly with time when given a good initial field because no spectral information is used. However, after diverging for ~200 hours, the errors stabilize, remaining comparable to those of state-of-the-art numerical wave models. Additionally, the error divergence can be mitigated through the assimilation of altimeter measurements. This deep learning model can not only serve as an efficient surrogate for traditional numerical wave models but also provide a baseline for statistical modeling of global SWH due to its simplicity in inputs and outputs."

However, large amounts of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) remain in sludge, and their interactions with microbes and enzymes would affect resource recovery. This article reviews the effects and mechanisms of PPCPs on anaerobic sludge treatment. Most PPCPs posed adverse impacts on methane production, while certain low-toxicity PPCPs could stimulate volatile fatty acids and biohydrogen accumulation. Changes in the microbial community structure and functional enzyme bioactivities were also summarized with PPCPs exposure. Notably, PPCPs such as carbamazepine could bind with the active sites of the enzyme and induce microbial stress responses. The fate of various PPCPs during anaerobic sludge treatment indicated that PPCPs featuring electron-donating groups (e.g., ·–NH2 and ·–OH), hydrophilicity, and low molecular weight were more susceptible to microbial utilization. Key biodegrading enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450 and amidase) were crucial for PPCP degradation, although several PPCPs remain refractory to biotransformation. Therefore, remediation technologies including physical pretreatment, chemicals, bioaugmentation, and their combinations for enhancing PPCPs degradation were outlined. Among these strategies, advanced oxidation processes and combined strategies effectively removed complex and refractory PPCPs mainly by generating free radicals, providing recommendations for improving sludge detoxification."

Subduction interfaces exhibit various slip styles, including slow slip events (SSEs). We use a micromechanics‐based approach to calculate the effective rheology of a shear zone containing ellipsoidal amphibolite clasts deforming by dislocation creep within an interconnected linear‐viscous phyllosilicate‐dominated matrix. Frictional failure occurs if local stress exceeds Mohr‐Coulomb yield strength. At moderate fluid overpressure, mixed‐frictional‐viscous behavior emerges at ∼ ${\sim} $350–560° ${}^{\circ}$C, consistent with a broad zone of mixed fault slip behavior without requiring extreme fluid overpressures. Increasing stress in this transition zone promotes local frictional failure and raises bulk strain rate. If, however, the bulk strain rate increases by more than one order of magnitude, system‐wide frictional sliding becomes preferable. This strain rate increase is insufficient to explain the slip rates observed in geophysically detectable SSEs. Therefore, viscous matrix flow as modeled here cannot explain SSEs without either invoking dynamic weakening within a frictional‐viscous flow or a mechanism switch to dominantly frictional sliding."

Karthikeyan,Role of Initial Conditions and Meteorological Drought in Soil Moisture Drought Propagation: An Event‐Based Causal Analysis Over South Asia,"
The role of meteorological droughts and initial conditions (land and atmosphere) in soil moisture drought (SMD) propagation are not yet fully understood. This work uses a drought event‐based causal framework to investigate the relative importance of meteorological drought (MD) duration and intensity and initial conditions that result in surface and rootzone SMD, considering their event‐level propagation time (PT) over South Asia. Initially, spatial variability of drought propagation is assessed by the Propagation Ratio (PR) computed based on MD counts that trigger SMD at various lags. PR depicts 2–3 months slower rootzone propagation than at surface. The gradual decrease in PR with increasing regional aridity indicates faster propagation over humid regions. The causal impact of initial conditions and MD parameters on propagating SMD are evaluated using normalized mutual information and a newly proposed normalized conditional mutual information. We found greater importance of triggering MD parameters followed by initial soil moisture condition on propagating SMD. This behavior is more evident for the surface layer propagation at shorter PT. There is a confounding effect of initial atmospheric conditions on drought propagation through initial soil moisture, depicting the significance of land‐atmosphere interactions prior to propagation. In the rootzone propagation, initial soil moisture has a greater influence on propagation, especially at longer PT, indicating the significance of soil moisture persistence. Stronger causal links obtained through the joint influence of MD parameters on SMD suggest the importance of accounting for MD duration and intensity simultaneously, which are not considered in drought index‐based propagation studies."

 Boron, essential for plant growth, necessitates precise regulation due to its potential toxicity. This regulation is achieved by borate transporters (BORs), which are homologous to the SLC4 family. The Arabidopsis thaliana Bor1 (AtBor1) transporter from clade I undergoes slow regulation through degradation and translational suppression, but its potential for fast regulation via direct activity modulation was unclear. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, and functional characterization to study AtBor1, revealing high-resolution structures of the dimer in one inactive and three active states. Our findings show that AtBor1 is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: an autoinhibitory domain at the carboxyl terminus obstructs the substrate pathway via conserved salt bridges, and phosphorylation of Thr410 allows interaction with a positively charged pocket at the cytosolic face, essential for borate transport. These results elucidate the molecular basis of AtBor1’s activity regulation and highlight its role in fast boron level regulation in plants.

We formulate an extension of sequential sampling models of decision-making in which confidence is used online to actively moderate the quality and quantity of evidence accumulated for decisions.

We highlight this feature by designing a dynamic sensory environment where evidence quality can be smoothly adapted within the timeframe of a single decision. Our model with confidence control offers a superior description of human behaviour in this environment, compared to sequential sampling models without confidence control. Using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG), we uncover EEG correlates of the model’s latent processes, and show stronger EEG-derived confidence control is associated with faster, more accurate decisions.

 Replication, heredity, and evolution are characteristic of Life. We and others have postulated that the reconstruction of a synthetic living system in the laboratory will be contingent on the development of a genetic self-replicator capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution. Although DNA-based life dominates, the in vitro reconstitution of an evolving DNA self-replicator has remained challenging. We hereby emulate in liposome compartments the principles according to which life propagates information and evolves. Using two different experimental configurations supporting intermittent or semi-continuous evolution (i.e., with or without DNA extraction, PCR, and re-encapsulation), we demonstrate sustainable replication of a linear DNA template – encoding the DNA polymerase and terminal protein from the Phi29 bacteriophage – expressed in the ‘protein synthesis using recombinant elements’ (PURE) system. The self-replicator can survive across multiple rounds of replication-coupled transcription-translation reactions in liposomes and, within only ten evolution rounds, accumulates mutations conferring a selection advantage. Combined data from next-generation sequencing with reverse engineering of some of the enriched mutations reveal nontrivial and context-dependent effects of the introduced mutations. The present results are foundational to build up genetic complexity in an evolving synthetic cell, as well as to study evolutionary processes in a minimal cell-free system.

 Arterial thrombosis is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide with no effective bioassay for clinical prediction.

 We can often anticipate the precise moment when a stimulus will be relevant for our behavioral goals. Voluntary temporal attention, the prioritization of sensory information at task-relevant time points, enhances visual perception. However, the neural mechanisms of voluntary temporal attention have not been isolated from those of temporal expectation, which reflects timing predictability rather than relevance. Here we use time-resolved steady-state visual evoked responses (SSVER) to investigate how temporal attention dynamically modulates visual activity when temporal expectation is controlled. We recorded magnetoencephalography while participants directed temporal attention to one of two sequential grating targets with predictable timing. Meanwhile, a co-localized SSVER probe continuously tracked visual cortical modulations both before and after the target stimuli. We find that in the pre-target period, the SSVER gradually ramps up as the targets approach, reflecting temporal expectation. Furthermore, we find a low-frequency modulation of the SSVER, which shifts approximately half a cycle in phase according to which target is attended. In the post-target period, temporal attention to the first target transiently modulates the SSVER shortly after target onset. Thus, temporal attention dynamically modulates visual cortical responses via both periodic pre-target and transient post-target mechanisms to prioritize sensory information at precise moments. People can direct attention to specific moments that they anticipate will be relevant to their goals.

They show that increased aridity of anuran habitats and drought exposure under climate change, combined with warming, can substantially reduce anuran activity. 
 Compared with the risks associated with climate warming and extremes, the risks of climate-induced drying to animal species remain understudied. This is particularly true for water-sensitive groups, such as anurans (frogs and toads), whose long-term survival must be considered in the context of both environmental changes and species sensitivity. Here, we mapped global areas where anurans will face increasing water limitations, analysed ecotype sensitivity to water loss and modelled behavioural activity impacts under future climate change scenarios. Predictions indicate that 6.6–33.6% of anuran habitats will become arid like by 2080–2100, with 15.4–36.1% exposed to worsening drought, under an intermediate- and high-emission scenario, respectively. Arid conditions are expected to double water loss rates, and combined drought and warming will double reductions in anuran activity compared with warming impacts alone by 2080–2100. These findings underscore the pervasive synergistic threat of warming and environmental drying to anurans.

 Social movements have the power to drive large-scale social change but the effectiveness of disruptive tactics in achieving this change is uncertain. To shed light on this debate, we conducted nationally representative surveys before and after a week-long disruptive campaign to block London’s M25 motorway (November 2022) by the protest group Just Stop Oil (n = 1,415). Our results suggest that increased awareness of a radical group as a result of a highly publicized non-violent disruptive protest can increase identification with and support for more moderate climate groups (here, Friends of the Earth) in the span of only 2 weeks. Our study provides new insights into the dynamics of social movements and the role of radical protest in driving change. The positive radical flank effect observed here suggests that non-violent radical actions may constitute a largely untapped strategic resource for moderate groups within the broader climate movement.

Anomalous ridging across Alaska, the West Coast, and Greenland drive increases in demand and extreme demand risk.

 Understanding litter decomposition processes in coastal macrophyte habitats is critically important for predicting ecosystem functioning. However, decomposition processes of litter mixtures in coastal habitats remain largely unexplored. Here, we evaluated the litter mixture effects on the decomposition of six marine macrophytes (two seagrasses and four macroalgae) through in situ litter-mixing experiments with five levels of litter species richness and 36 different litter compositions. We found that the litter species identity and composition, rather than species richness, were crucial in structuring benthic faunal communities. Macroalgal litter, particularly Sargassum sp., hosted higher numbers of polychaetes and crustaceans than seagrass litter. More macroalgal presence induced faster decomposition rates of seagrass litter in the late stage, but not in the early stage. These findings suggest that changes in macrophyte diversity and composition can alter decomposition processes and, consequently, the sediment organic carbon stock through the transition of litter sources and benthic faunas.

 Low atmospheric oxygen levels during the mid-Proterozoic were occasionally interrupted by transient high oxygen levels. The cause of mid-Proterozoic ocean redox variability remains unclear. Here we investigate mercury chemostratigraphy across the Jixian section of North China Craton through two oxygenation intervals. Abnormal spikes in mercury concentration and excursions of mercury isotopes are observed in the Dahongyu and Hongshuizhuang formations, which occur just below the two oxygenation intervals, respectively. These mercury anomalies suggest that the two oxygenation events were preceded by subaerial volcanism. Furthermore, the two oxygenation intervals show increased nutrient concentrations and negative shifts in mercury isotopes, indicating that enhanced weathering and terrestrial nutrient influx occurred during oxygenation intervals. We infer that in the breakup setting of the Columbia supercontinent, large igneous province volcanism and its efficient low-latitude weathering could rapidly increase terrestrial nutrient influx into the ocean, promoting oceanic productivity and a pulsed rise in oxygen levels.

 Average leaf inclination angle (θ¯L) is an important canopy structure variable that influences light regime, photosynthesis, and evapotranspiration of plants. θ¯L can be measured through direct methods (e.g., protractor), which are labor-intensive and time-consuming, or through indirect optical instruments, which are more efficient than the direct methods. However, uncertainties of different indirect optical instruments for quantifying θ¯L remain largely unquantified. In this study, we evaluated and compared the performances of three major indirect optical instruments: (1) LAI-2200, (2) 30°-tilted camera, and (3) digital hemispherical photography (DHP), in different crop fields over a growing season, benchmarked with direct measurements. LAI-2200 and 30°-tilted camera showed higher agreement with direct θ¯ measurements (R2 = 0.54, RMSE = 7.37°; R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 8.08°) than DHP (R2 = 0.14, RMSE = 13.96°). Different performances of indirect optical instruments could be attributed to the accuracy of gap fraction measurement and the performance of the θ¯L quantification algorithms. When using the LAI-2200 algorithm, larger gap fraction gradients over view zenith angles led to larger θ¯L values, and smaller gap fraction gradients led to smaller θ¯L values. Such error propagation was larger in sparse canopy than in dense canopy. The Wilson G function of the LAI-2200 algorithm performed better in estimating θ¯L than the G function based on the ellipsoidal LAD function used by the CAN_EYE algorithm. We also proposed a modification of the LAI-2200 algorithm, which further improved the performance of LAI-2200 and 30°-tilted cameras in estimating θ¯L. We envision that the low-cost 30°-tilted cameras provide a promising sensor solution to continuously monitor canopy structure for various ecosystems."

Previous studies, primarily centered on the OECD region, have indicated that most of these technologies are contentious, eliciting low levels of public support. By conducting a set of nationally representative surveys examining seven CDR and three SRM technologies in 30 countries, we show that public skepticism is most prominent in wealthier countries. Respondents from these countries express lower confidence in the potential of science and technology to address climate change, diminished trust in industry, and expect to experience less personal harm from climate change. At the same time, there are many countries, not previously studied, where the levels of support for CDR and SRM are relatively high. As middle-income countries, their capability to effectively implement these technologies may be deficient; additionally, there is a risk of the unilateral implementation of certain technologies with uncertain implications in terms of their impacts on climate. This underscores the necessity for long term climate strategies that are context-specific and tailored to individual countries, while moreover emphasizing the imperative for extensive international collaboration, including through technological and financial transfers.

This mobilization impacts local ecosystems and regional climate feedback loops, playing a crucial role in the Arctic carbon cycle. Here, we analyze the stable carbon (δ13C) and radiocarbon (F14C) isotopic compositions of dissolved CO2 and CH4 in the Sagavanirktok and Kuparuk River watersheds on the North Slope, Alaska. By examining spatial and seasonal variations in these isotopic signatures, we identify patterns of carbon release and transport across the river continuum. We find consistent CO2 isotopic values along the geomorphological gradient, reflecting a mixture of geogenic and biogenic sources integrated throughout the watershed. Bayesian mixing models further demonstrate a systematic depletion in 13C and 14C signatures of dissolved CO2 sources from spring to fall, indicating increasing contributions of aged carbon as the active layer deepens. This seasonal deepening allows percolating groundwater to access deeper, older soil horizons, transporting CO2 produced by aerobic and anaerobic soil respiration to streams and rivers. In contrast, we observe no clear relationships between the 13C and 14C compositions of dissolved CH4 and landscape properties. Given the reduced solubility of CH4, which facilitates outgassing and limits its transport in aquatic systems, the isotopic signatures are likely indicative of localized contributions from streambeds, adjacent water saturated soils, and lake outflows.

Meaningful early warning systems with adequate lead times (weeks to months) are needed to guide public health decision–making and enhance community resilience against health threats posed by climate change. Toward this goal, we trained various machine-learning models to predict diarrhoeal disease rates in Nepal (2002–2014), Taiwan (2008–2019), and Vietnam (2000–2015) using temperature, precipitation, previous disease rates, and El Niño Southern Oscillation phases. We also compared the performance of shallow time-series neural network (NN), Random Forest Regressor, artificial nn, gradient boosting regressor, and long short-term memory–based methods for their effectiveness in predicting diarrhoeal disease burden across multiple countries. We evaluated model performance using a test dataset and assessed the accuracy of predicted diarrhoeal disease incidence rates for the last year of available data in each district. Our results suggest that even in the absence of the most recent disease surveillance data, a likely scenario in most low- and middle-income countries, our NN-based early warning system using historical data performs reasonably well. However, future studies are needed to perform prospective evaluations of such early warning systems in real-world settings."

Second, we illustrate the potential implications and mechanisms of certification. In this study, therefore, we aim to first document agricultural input and output differences between certified and non-certified smallholder farmers, second to illustrate potential effects of certification with observational data and third to provide guidance for future rigorous causal analyses. We find generally positive correlations between RSPO certification, land productivity, profits, and fertilizer use, and a negative correlation with toxic herbicide use. However, we do not find price premiums for RSPO-certified farmers. Overall, the results of this study are indicative of potentially modest effects of RSPO-certification that may operate through higher productivity due to improved management practices that remain agrochemical intensive but avoid some particularly harmful chemicals. Our findings are relevant to better understand the strong sustainability claims of RSPO marketing and to provide guidance for rigorous causal experimental and quasi-experimental studies."

We propose a research agenda to address these challenges, by taxonomising and evaluating the effectiveness of different visual forms in decision-making contexts, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

Regional OIF simulated by itself poleward of 45° North and South is responsible for +86.9 Pg C additional ocean carbon uptake. AU-only experiments do not significantly enhance ocean carbon uptake due to the lack of iron in the upwelled waters. We find no consistent relationship between enhanced cumulative export production and changes in the ocean carbon inventory attributable to the biological carbon pump, which makes export production a poor indicator for additional ocean carbon uptake. We identified a strong decrease in the global ocean nitrate inventory (−567 Tmol N) until year 2100 as a consequence of globally applied AU + OIF due to an interrupted balance between N2-fixation and denitrification."

However, the combined global warming impacts (GWIs), contribution from carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, methane (CH4) fluxes, and albedo changes (Δα) remain poorly understood. Here, we reported the combined GWIs of CO2, CH4, and albedo with eddy covariance (EC) measurements during 2020–2022 in a subtropical island forest located in the Nanji Islands National Marine Protected Area in Southern China. We suggested that the island forest acted as a significant carbon sink, with annual CO2 and CH4 fluxes of −548.6 ± 11.1 and −5.67 ± 1.1 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively, while the daily albedo varied within the range of 0.03–0.15. By converting the radiative forcing induced by CH4 and albedo change in the forest to CO2 equivalents, we analyzed the three contributors to the combined GWI. The annual averages GWI of CO2 uptake, CH4 uptake, and Δα were −2 011.6 ± 40.6, −211.3 ± 1.1, and 0.03 ± 4.5 g CO2-eq m−2 yr−1, respectively, with a mean combined GWI of −2 223 ± 40.8 g CO2-eq m−2 yr−1.

Nanji Island forest had a strong positive effect on climate change mitigation, with CO2 and CH4 uptake greatly enhancing its cooling benefits. Using Pearson correlation and path analysis, we found photosynthetically active radiation, precipitation, soil water content were the primary factors controlling the GWI dynamics, mainly driving the changes in CO2 fluxes. This study provided novel insights into the establishment of the overall evaluation framework for ecosystem-scale GWIs of CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and albedo based on long-term EC measurements in an island forest."

We present 2 months of INP measurements in a Finnish boreal forest using a new semi-autonomous INP counting device based on gas expansion. These results show strong variability in INP concentrations, and we present a case that the INPs we observe are, at least some of the time, of biological origin. 
 Cloud properties are strongly influenced by ice formation; hence, we need to understand the sources of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) around the globe. Boreal forests are known as sources of bioaerosol, and recent work indicates that these dominate the INP spectra above −24 °C. To quantify the INP population at temperatures below −24 °C, we deployed a portable cloud expansion chamber (PINE) in a Finnish boreal forest from 13 March 2018 to 11 May 2018. Using the 6 min time resolution PINE data, we present several lines of evidence that INPs below −24 °C in this location are also from biological sources: (i) an INP parameterization developed for a pine forest site in Colorado, where many INPs were shown to be biological, produced a good fit to our measurements; a moderate correlation of INPs with aerosol concentration larger than 0.5 µm and the fluorescent bioaerosol concentration; (ii) a negative correlation with relative humidity that may relate to enhanced release of bioaerosol at low humidity from local sources such as the prolific lichen population in boreal forests; and (iii) the absence of correlation with ultra-fine particles (3.5 to 50 nm), indicating that new particle formation events are not sources of INPs. This study should motivate further work to establish whether the commonality in bioaerosol ice-nucleating properties between spring in Finland and summer in Colorado is more generally applicable to different coniferous forest locations and times and also to determine to what extent these bioaerosols are transported to locations where they may affect clouds."

This dataset will allow us, for the first time, to quantify the biodiversity impact of the Messinian salinity crisis, a major geological event that possibly changed global and regional climate and biota. 
 The Messinian salinity crisis and its precursor events have been the greatest environmental perturbation of the Mediterranean Sea to date, offering an opportunity to study the response of marine ecosystems to extreme hydrological change and a large-scale biological invasion. The restriction of the marine connection between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean resulted in stratification of the water column and high-amplitude variations in seawater temperature and salinity already from the early Messinian. Here, we present a unified and revised marine fossil record of the Mediterranean (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13358435, Agiadi et al., 2024) that covers the Tortonian stage, the pre-evaporitic Messinian stage, and the Zanclean stage and encompasses 23 032 occurrences of calcareous nannoplankton, dinoflagellates, foraminifera, corals, ostracods, bryozoans, echinoids, mollusks, fishes, and marine mammals. This record adheres to the FAIR principles, is updated in terms of taxonomy, and follows the currently accepted stratigraphic framework. Based on this record, knowledge gaps are identified, which are due to spatiotemporal inconsistencies in sampling effort and the distribution of sedimentary facies, as well as the inherent differences in the preservation potential between the groups. Additionally, sampling bias in old records may have distorted the record in favor of larger, more impressive taxa within groups. This record is now ready to be used to answer both geological and biological questions about the Mediterranean Sea and beyond and is amendable when new fossil data are brought to light."

The underpinning soil profiles were shared by a wide range of data providers. Special attention was paid to the standardisation of soil property definitions, analytical method descriptions and property values. We present three measures to assess ""fitness for intended use"" of the standardised data. 
 Snapshots derived from the World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) are served freely to the international community. These static datasets provide quality-assessed and standardised soil profile data that can be used to support digital soil mapping and environmental applications at broad scale levels. Since the release of the preceding snapshot in 2019, refactored ETL (extract, transform and load) procedures for screening, ingesting and standardising disparate source data have been developed. In conjunction with this, the WoSIS data model was overhauled, making it compatible with the ISO 28258 and Observations and Measurements (O&M) domain models. Additional procedures for querying, serving and downloading the publicly available standardised data have been implemented using open software (e.g. GraphQL API). Following up on a short discussion of these methodological developments we discuss the structure and content of the “WoSIS 2023 snapshot”. A range of new soil datasets was shared with us, registered in the ISRIC World Data Centre for Soils (WDC-Soils) data repository and subsequently processed in accordance with the licences specified by the data providers. An important effort has been the processing of forest soil data collated in the framework of the EU-HoliSoils project. We paid special attention to the standardisation of soil property definitions, description of the soil analytical procedures and standardisation of the units of measurement. The 2023 snapshot considers soil chemical properties (total carbon, organic carbon, inorganic carbon (total carbonate equivalent), total nitrogen, phosphorus (extractable P, total P and P retention), soil pH, cation exchange capacity and electrical conductivity) and physical properties (soil texture (sand, silt and clay), bulk density, coarse fragments and water retention), grouped according to analytical procedures that are operationally comparable. Method options are defined for each analytical procedure (e.g. pH measured in water, KCl or CaCl2 solution, molarity of the solution, and soil / solution ratio). For each profile we also provide the original soil classification (i.e. FAO, WRB and USDA system with their version) and pedological horizon designations as far as these have been specified in the source databases. Three measures for “fitness for intended use” are provided to facilitate informed data use: (a) positional uncertainty of the profile's site location, (b) possible uncertainty associated with the operationally defined analytical procedures and (c) date of sampling. The most recent (i.e. dynamic) dataset, called wosis_latest, is freely accessible via various web services. To permit consistent referencing and citation, we also provide a static snapshot (in this case, December 2023). This snapshot comprises quality-assessed and standardised data for 228 000 geo-referenced profiles. The data come from 174 countries and represent more than 900 000 soil layers (or horizons) and over 6 million records. The number of measurements for each soil property varies (greatly) between profiles and with depth, this generally depending on the objectives of the initial soil sampling programmes. In the coming years, we aim to gradually fill gaps in the geographic distribution of the profiles, as well as in the soil observations themselves, this subject to the sharing of a wider selection of “public” soil data by prospective data contributors; possible solutions for this are discussed.

In this study, we unraveled the overlooked but crucial role of sulfite radical (SO3·–) in the efficient selective reduction of toxic Cr(VI) under near-neutral conditions. Fast removal of Cr(VI) at around pH 7 in sulfite/UV was found to be attributable to high reactivity of SO3·– toward HCrO4– (∼5.3 × 106 M–1 s–1). Furthermore, SO3·– was fast generated in situ via one-electron oxidation of S(IV) by transient reactive protonated Cr(V) and Cr(IV) intermediates. Therefore, the specific reactivity of SO3·– and its in situ generation together resulted in the surprisingly positive effect of nitrate and the efficient reduction of Cr(VI) in authentic surface water and industrial wastewater. A mathematical model was developed to simulate Cr(VI) removal in the process, and thus quantitatively demonstrated the roles of reactive species, i.e., SO3·– contributed to ∼93% of Cr(VI) reduction in surface water. Overall, this study provides an insight into the pivotal role of SO3·– in Cr(VI) reduction, and underscores its significance in selective reduction and detoxification of contaminants."

The released trace metals from peridotite and basalt, especially Fe, Ni, and Co, accounted for the promotion effect.

In this study, we monitored levels of  cCO2, FCO2, and  the composition of DOM over a 24 h period at three sites during the dry and wet seasons in China’s largest urban lake, Tangxun Lake.

However, there are no U.S. federal water reuse regulations and states are currently considering microbial treatment targets for various applications. Previous publications have yet to address this need by using an updated and consistent set of input parameters to present risk-based microbial treatment targets across a wide range of sources of water, end-use applications, and health benchmarks. This work combines the most current modeling inputs and dose–response parameter values to provide probability of infection and disease burden-based microbial treatment targets for untreated municipal wastewater, untreated onsite wastewater, graywater, stormwater, and roof runoff water used for potable reuse, indoor nonpotable use, and landscape irrigation applications."

Here, direct formation of the same DMPO adduct as that formed by genuine radical trapping of •OH is discovered, while quinones (i.e., 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), methyl-BQ (2-Me-BQ, 2,5-Me-BQ, 2,6-Me-BQ), and chlorinated-BQ (2-Cl-BQ, 2,5-Cl-BQ, 2,6-Cl-BQ)) meet with the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), independent of peroxides. According to differences in alcohol-derived adducts (e.g., DMPO-CH2OH or DMPO-OCH3) while alcohol is attacked by •OH or DMPO•+, a nonradical mechanism is proposed for the BQ/DMPO system. This is further evidenced by the mass spectrometry data in which DMPO-OCH3 has been identified in BQ (or chlorinated-BQ)/DMPO systems. 17O incorporation experiments verify that hydroxyl oxygen in DMPO-OH originates from water. The DMPO-OH adduct might be formed via direct oxidation and water substitution or one-electron oxidation and nucleophilic addition. This study provides a peroxide-independent alternative route leading to DMPO-OH adduct in quinone-based systems, which has profound implications for assessing adverse health effects and even biogeochemical impacts of quinones if EPR is applied."

Moreover, whether this feedback is influenced by initial N availability in leguminous and non‐leguminous forest soils has not been clarified. Here, we found that the addition of plant‐ and microbial‐derived C significantly enhanced soil nitrogenase activity (13∼28%) and that microbial‐derived C had a more positive impact. These positive effects were attributed to the direct C‐energy supply (0.49∼0.84) rather than variations in soil microbial activity (−0.01∼0.21) and substrate resources (−0.45∼0.27). Long‐term N addition did not inhibit FLNF. C addition promoted FLNF in soils of the two forests, but the response rate was higher in the leguminous forest soils.

Although these circulations are ubiquitous in convective boundary layers over land, their impacts on the surface energy balance are largely unknown. Doppler lidar and surface observations were combined with DOE E3SM land model experiments, revealing increased surface winds (5 m/s) and heat fluxes (50 W/m2) in convergent branches of HCRs. Larger wind‐driven flux responses (up to 150 W/m2) were found along gust fronts. Surface energy balance shifts to accommodate wind‐driven fluxes, reducing ground heat conduction and longwave cooling. Our findings from the US Southern Great Plains are broadly relevant to modeling convective boundary layers. In particular, widely used subgrid wind gust parameterizations were found to be physically inconsistent with resolved secondary circulations and could worsen climate prediction biases at kilometer‐scales."

Persistent fluctuations in the latitudinal position of the North Atlantic (NATL) jet stream are closely linked to extreme weather anomalies, particularly over Europe. Accurately representing jet stream persistence in climate models is essential for enhancing the reliability of future regional extreme weather projections. This study investigates the summer persistence of the NATL jet stream latitudinal fluctuations and the Summer North Atlantic Oscillation (SNAO) using data from CMIP6 models and ERA5 reanalysis. Our findings reveal that CMIP6 models generally overestimate persistence compared to ERA5 during the historical period. Utilizing the relative vorticity tendency equation, we assess the strength of the eddy‐mean flow feedback and identify a positive relationship between persistence and feedback strength across models. We also found that a large fraction of the intermodel spread in precipitation persistence is associated with differences in the persistence of jet fluctuations."

Here, we investigate the response of bars to upstream damming by examining patterns, mechanisms, and impacts in the Middle Yangtze River (∼1,000 km). Over a decade of post‐damming observational data reveal substantial increases in bar revegetation and Leaf Area Index. Shorter flood duration and stable bar size collectively drive bar greening. Consequently, denser vegetation has slowed flow velocity by 17% ± 2% and increased flow resistance by 21% ± 5%, offsetting the water‐level decrease from channel expansion due to scouring and even causing a slight rise in floodwater levels. Furthermore, damming has markedly altered river connectivity, thermal regimes, and solute dynamics, detrimentally affecting fish habitats and aquatic life.

Hyper‐resolution land surface modeling provides an unprecedented opportunity to simulate locally relevant water and energy cycles. However, the available meteorological forcing data is often insufficient to fulfill the requirements of hyper‐resolution modeling. Here, we developed a comprehensive downscaling framework based on topography‐adjusted methods and automated machine learning (AutoML). With this framework, a 90 m and hourly atmospheric forcing data set was developed from ERA5 data at a 0.25° resolution, and the Common Land Model (CoLM) was then forced with the developed forcing data over two complex terrain regions (the Heihe River Basin and Upper Colorado River Basin). We systematically evaluated the downscaled forcing and the CoLM outputs against both in situ observations and gridded data. The ground‐based validation results suggested consistent improvements for all downscaled forcing variables with mean RMSE improved by 6.362%–95.86%. The downscaled forcings, which incorporated detailed topographic features, offered improved magnitude estimates, achieving a comparable level of performance to that of regional reanalysis forcing data. The downscaled forcing driving the CoLM model showed comparable or better skills in simulating water and energy fluxes, as verified by in situ validations. The hyper‐resolution simulations provided a detailed and more reasonable description of land surface processes and attained similar spatial patterns and magnitudes with high‐resolution land surface data, especially over highly elevated areas. Additionally, this study highlighted the benefits of using mountain radiation theory‐based shortwave radiation downscaling models and AutoML‐assisted precipitation downscaling models.

The atmospheric circulation in the northern hemisphere interacts with that in the southern hemisphere mainly via lateral coupling and atmospheric mass exchanges across equator. Using the NCEP‐NCAR daily reanalysis over period 1979–2019, we examine the Inter‐Hemispheric Oscillation (IHO) on the synoptic timescale during boreal winter and its associations with Rossby waves by employing a 9‐day high‐pass filter and the time‐lag regression method. Our results demonstrate that the IHO exist in the surface air pressure anomalies on synoptic timescale which links to both the quasi‐stationary and migratory Rossby waves with large amplitudes in the mid‐ and high‐ latitudes from the troposphere up to the stratosphere. The synoptic‐IHO related quasi‐stationary waves appear mainly in zonal, roughly dominated by waves with wave‐number 1–7 at different latitudes. These waves disperse the wave energy eastward along westerly jet streams. On the other hand, the synoptic‐IHO related migratory Rossby waves are mainly observed in mid latitudes between 30°N–65°N and 30°S–60°S with stronger intensity in northern than in southern hemisphere. The phase speed of these waves is roughly estimated at about 9.5lon/d. The energy of intrinsic Rossby waves also propagates mainly eastward. The synoptic‐IHO has important impacts on surface air temperature via both the quasi‐stationary and migratory Rossby waves, inducing significant temperature changes over both Eurasian continent and North America as estimated from 40 winters. All the results are beneficial for us to better understand the IHO along with its interaction with Rossby waves and the formation mechanisms of cold weather and climate extremes during boreal winter."

Persistent warm temperature anomalies can drive streamflow in regions where snow and glacier melt are important constituents of streamflow. However, the spatiotemporal variability of the streamflow response depends on both the magnitude of the forcing temperature anomalies and the nature of the underlying hydrological system. Here we ask: when, where, and for what magnitude of temperature anomalies will the streamflow response change most rapidly under warming? We use observed streamflow and temperature for 868 basins across Canada to quantify the streamflow response during warm temperature anomalies and how such responses vary in space, time, and by anomaly magnitude. We first identify two temporal modes of the streamflow response, one in autumn and one in spring, the relative strength of which varies by climate. We then use sinusoidal approximations of seasonal temperature cycles to characterize the sensitivity of such modes to changes in annual temperature. At individual basins, we find that relative to moderate warm events, the streamflow response to more extreme warm events is more sensitive to changes in mean annual temperatures, and this sensitivity is greatest in the coastal, southern, and central regions of Canada. Our results have implications for how the hydrological impacts of extreme events, such as heatwaves, will change in space and time under future climate change."

The formation of floods, as a complex physical process, exhibits dynamic changes in its driving factors over time and space under climate change. Due to the black‐box nature of deep learning, its use alone does not enhance understanding of hydrological processes. The challenge lies in employing deep learning to uncover new knowledge on flood formation mechanism. This study proposes an interpretable framework for deep learning flood modeling that employs interpretability techniques to elucidate the inner workings of a peak‐sensitive Informer, revealing the dynamic response of floods to driving factors in 482 watersheds across the United States. Accurate simulation is a prerequisite for interpretability techniques to provide reliable information. The study reveals that comparing the Informer with Transformer and LSTM, the former showed superior performance in peak flood simulation (Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency over 0.6 in 70% of watersheds). By interpreting Informer's decision‐making process, three primary flood‐inducing patterns were identified: Precipitation, excess soil water, and snowmelt. The controlling effect of dominant factors is regional, and their impact on floods in time steps shows significant differences, challenging the traditional understanding that variables closer to the timing of flood event occurrence have a greater impact. Over 40% of watersheds exhibited shifts in dominant driving factors between 1981 and 2020, with precipitation‐dominated watersheds undergoing more significant changes, corroborating climate change responses. Additionally, the study unveils the interplay and dynamic shifts among variables. These findings suggest that interpretable deep learning, through reverse deduction, transforms data‐driven models from merely fitting nonlinear relationships to effective tools for enhancing understanding of hydrological characteristics."

 Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect are two paradigmatic wave localization phenomena, resulting from wave interference and the intrinsic non-Hermitian point gap, respectively. In this study, we unveil a novel localization phenomenon associated with long-range asymmetric coupling, termed scale-tailored localization, where the number of induced localized modes and their localization lengths scale exclusively with the coupling range. We show that the long-range coupling fundamentally reshapes the energy spectra and eigenstates by creating multiple connected paths on the lattice. Furthermore, we present experimental observations of scale-tailored localization in non-Hermitian electrical circuits utilizing adjustable voltage followers and switches. The circuit admittance spectra possess separate point-shaped and loop-shaped components in the complex energy plane, corresponding respectively to skin modes and scale-tailored localized states. Our findings not only expand and deepen the understanding of peculiar effects induced by non-Hermiticity but also offer a feasible experimental platform for exploring and controlling wave localizations.

 Efficient catalysis of ammonia borane (AB) holds potential for realizing controlled energy release from hydrogen fuel and addressing cost challenges faced by hydrogen storage. Here, we report that amorphous domains on metallic Fe crystal structures (R-Fe2O3 Foam) can achieve AB catalytic performances and stability (turnover frequency (TOF) of 113.6 min−1, about 771 L H2 in 900 h, and 43.27 mL/(min·cm2) for 10×10 cm2 of Foam) that outperform reported benchmarks (most <14 L H2 in 45 h) by at least 20 times. These notable increases are enabled by the stable Fe crystal structure, while defects and unsaturated atoms in the amorphous domains form Fe-B intermediates that significantly lower the dissociation barriers of H2O and AB. Given that the catalyst lifetime is a key determinant for the practical use in fuel cells, our R-Fe2O3 Foam also provides decent H2 supply (180 mL H2/min, AB water solution of 7.5 wt% H2) in a driven commercial car fuel cell at stable power outputs (7.8 V and 1.6 A for at least 5 h).

 Achieving net-zero climate targets requires some level of carbon dioxide removal. Current assessments focus on tonnes of CO2 removed, without specifying what form these removals will take. Here, we show that countries’ climate pledges require approximately 1 (0.9–1.1) billion ha of land for removals.

We analyse how this demand for land is distributed geographically and over time. The results are concerning, both in terms of the aggregate area of land, but also the rate and extent of land use change. Our findings demonstrate a gap between governments’ expected reliance on land and the role that land can realistically play in climate mitigation.

 Cortical feedback connections are extremely numerous but the logic of connectivity between higher and lower areas remains poorly understood. Feedback from higher visual areas to primary visual cortex (V1) has been shown to enhance responses on perceptual figures compared to backgrounds, an effect known as figure-background modulation (FBM). A likely source of this feedback are border-ownership (BO) selective cells in mid-tier visual areas (e.g. V4) which represent the location of figures. We examined the connectivity between V4 cells and V1 cells using noise-correlations and micro-stimulation to estimate connectivity strength. We show that connectivity is consistent with a model in which BO-tuned V4 cells send positive feedback in the direction of their preferred figure and negative feedback in the opposite direction. This connectivity scheme can recreate patterns of FBM observed in previous studies. These results provide insights into the cortical connectivity underlying figure-background perception and establish a link between FBM and BO-tuning.

 Little is known about the origin of germ cells in humans. We previously leveraged post-zygotic mutations to reconstruct zygote-rooted cell lineage ancestry trees in a phenotypically normal woman, termed NC0. Here, by sequencing the genome of her children and their father, we analyze the transmission of early pre-gastrulation lineages and corresponding mutations across human generations. We find that the germline in NC0 is polyclonal and is founded by at least two cells likely descending from the two blastomeres arising from the first zygotic cleavage. Analyzes of public data from several multi-children families and from 1934 familial quads confirm this finding in larger cohorts, revealing that known imbalances of up to 90:10 in early lineages allocation in somatic tissues are not reflected in mutation transmission to offspring, establishing a fundamental difference in lineage allocation between the soma and the germline.

 Among the emerging ‘beyond lithium-ion’ technologies for maximized sustainability, lithium–sulfur (Li–S) is a favoured chemistry because of its exceptional energy density from the conversion of sulfur, an element in abundant supply. However, the dissolution of several intermediate polysulfides formed during conversion leads to rapid performance degradation over cycling. Here we address this issue by sulfurizing a hybrid polymer network with polyphosphazene and carbon as a cathode for Li–S batteries. With rich sites to re-bond and adsorb dissociative sulfur species, this hybrid polymer network circumvents the formation of soluble polysulfides and enables a unique, reversible inserting conversion reaction. Thus, our cathode delivers both high capacity (~900 mAh g−1cathode) and excellent cycling stability in Li–S coin cells, with a pouch cell demonstration of projected energy density of ~300 Wh kg−1 and 84.9% capacity retention after 150 cycles. The strategy can be extended to other cost-effective, recyclable polymers, advancing sulfur-based batteries towards practical energy storage application.

 In recent years, the demand for lithium (Li) has been on the rise as Li-ion batteries are playing an increasingly important role in powering the global transition to a low-carbon society. In contrast to the predominant production of lithium from hard rock, lithium extraction from brine sources has proven more economical and sustainable.

Taking advantage of selective binding between EDTA4− and Mg2+, our process achieves ultrahigh Mg2+ rejection of 99.85%, ultrafast Li+ flux of ~4.34 mol m−2 h−1 and unprecedented Li+/Mg2+ separation factor (~679) under industrial conditions (127.06 g l−1).

Preferred transitions among patterns of variability are identified, revealing long-term predictability on decadal timescales related to shifts in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation phases. Combining this framework with model-analog techniques, we demonstrate prediction skill of large-scale SLA patterns and low-frequency coastal SLA variations comparable to that from initialized hindcasts.

 A renewable energy design optimization model is proposed to plan investments in power, water, and heat technologies. The intermittent nature of renewables requires that these models capture the variability and complementarity of resources at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, most planning models use time-series reduction methods that, while capturing data variance, often smooth out extreme weather or demand patterns. To account for extreme patterns and design reliable energy systems, we propose a clustering-optimization framework that considers extreme weather days. This framework is applied to design an integrated multi-sector energy system for the Neom region in Saudi Arabia. Our results show that fully renewable systems designed without considering extreme days could not meet demands and instead required external power or water supplies during a post-optimization simulation.

 Evaporation rates and land surface temperatures can be modified by planned water availability as well as land use and land cover changes. In general, a higher evaporation rate via its associated latent heat flux yields a cooler surface. Here we demonstrate that increasing energy at the land surface necessitates more intense latent heat fluxes for the same unit degree of surface cooling. When the wet-surface temperature is around 25 °C, a unit drop in land surface temperature requires about twice as much water to evaporate than when it is only 10 °C. As a consequence, today an estimated 5 ± 3% of extra water may be needed to evaporate globally for the same cooling effect as before the industrial era when near surface air temperature over land was about 1.5 °C cooler on average.

 The transportation environment is one we are exposed to every day. However, previous research on exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their acute health effects in various public transportation is limited. To address this gap, we conducted a panel study involving 25 healthy adults, investigating the exposures and acute health effects of exposures to 24 VOC species during 40-min commutes in Beijing's subways, buses and taxis during early spring 2023. Our findings revealed that exposure to multiple VOC species, including toluene, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, ethylacetate, resulted in a decrease in Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Specifically, SDNN decreased by 4.37 ms (95%CI: −8.52, −0.21) with per interquartile range (IQR) increase in ethylacetate; rMSSD decreased by 9.93 ms (95%CI: −19.01, −0.86), 4.75 ms (95%CI: −8.63, −0.86), and 7.00 ms (95%CI: −13.20, −0.81) with per IQR increase in toluene, styrene, and tetrachloroethylene, respectively; HF decreased by 154.07 ms2 (95%CI: −284.03, −24.11) with per IQR increase in carbon tetrachloride. For joint effect of these VOC species, we found significant associations with HRV only in taxis. Moreover, higher cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane exposures were linked to reports of sick car syndrome. Despite wearing masks during the COVID-19 period, comparative results from a supplementary experiment conducted post-COVID-19 without masks indicated that masks may not significantly reduce the adverse effects of VOC exposure. Our findings indicated the potential acute health risks of short-term VOC exposures in public transportation, particularly in taxis, highlighting the necessity to improve air quality and related standards in these micro-environments."

Our results reveal a systematic underestimation of flood risk in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps, especially in Appalachia, parts of New England, and the Northwest. These three regions face two additional risks: high levels of social vulnerability and skepticism about climate change. Nationally, there is a statisically significant correlation (0.19, p < 0.005) between flood risk and climate change skepticism, which increases (0.28, p < 0.005) in regions with high FEMA undercounts and elevated flood risk. Climate change skepticism manifests as distrust in science, an underestimation of property and community risk, and a resistance to mitigation and adaptation efforts. Indicators of social vulnerability, such as poverty rates, physical disabilities, unemployment, households in mobile homes, and lack of vehicle access, are especially pronounced in Appalachia. Addressing this geographically-embedded triple exposure—flood risk, social vulnerability, climate change skepticism— requires strategies to enhance local resilience. These include revising the 100-year floodplain categorization in FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program to better reflect climate change, conducting public education campaigns in vulnerable communities, and scaling-up financial assistance for flood mitigation and adaptation projects."

The research aircraft measured wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity and sea surface at high resolution. Wind parks reduce the wind speed, and the data help to determine how long it takes for the wind speed to recover. The coast also plays an important role, and the wind speed varies with distance from the coast. The results help in wind park planning and better estimating the energy yield. 
 Between 14 March 2020 and 11 September 2021, meteorological measurement flights were conducted above the German Bight in the framework of the project X-Wakes. The scope of the measurements was to study the transition of the wind field and atmospheric stability from the coast to the sea, to study the interaction of wind park wakes, and to study the large-scale modification of the marine atmospheric boundary layer by the presence of wind parks. In total, 49 measurement flights were performed with the research aircraft Dornier 128 of the Technische Universität (TU) Braunschweig during different seasons and different stability conditions. Seven of the flights in the time period from 24 to 30 July 2021 were organised using a second research aircraft, the Cessna F406 of TU Braunschweig. The instrumentation of both aircraft consisted of a nose boom with sensors for measuring the wind vector, temperature and humidity and, additionally, a surface temperature sensor. The Dornier 128 was further equipped with a laser scanner for deriving sea state properties and two downward-looking cameras in the visible and infrared wavelength range. The Cessna F406 was additionally equipped with shortwave and longwave broadband radiation sensors for measuring upward and downward solar and terrestrial radiation. A detailed overview of the aircraft, sensors, data post-processing and flight patterns is provided here. Further, averaged profiles of atmospheric parameters illustrate the range of conditions.

 Long time series of spatiotemporally continuous phytoplankton functional type (PFT) data are essential for understanding marine ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles as well as for effective marine management. In this study, we integrated artificial intelligence (AI) technology with multisource marine big data to develop a spatial–temporal–ecological ensemble model based on deep learning (STEE-DL). This model generated the first AI-driven global daily gap-free 4 km PFT chlorophyll a concentration product from 1998 to 2023 (AIGD-PFT). The AIGD-PFT significantly enhances the accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage of quantifying eight major PFTs: diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes, pelagophytes, cryptophytes, green algae, prokaryotes, and Prochlorococcus. The model input encompasses (1) physical oceanographic, biogeochemical, and spatiotemporal information and (2) ocean colour data (OC-CCI v6.0) that have been gap-filled using a discrete cosine transform–penalized least squares (DCT-PLS) approach. The STEE-DL model utilizes an ensemble strategy with 100 residual neural network (ResNet) models, applying Monte Carlo and bootstrapping methods to estimate the optimal PFT chlorophyll a concentration and assess the model uncertainty through ensemble means and standard deviations. The model's performance was validated using multiple cross-validation strategies – random, spatial-block, and temporal-block methods – combined with in situ data, demonstrating STEE-DL's robustness and generalization capability. The daily updates and seamless nature of the AIGD-PFT data product capture the complex dynamics of coastal regions effectively.

This model accurately maps water depths with an accuracy of ~1 m. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing global bathymetry models in shallow regions. Our model exhibited superior performance in capturing fine-scale bathymetric features with unprecedented spatial resolution, providing essential data for marine applications. 
 Accurate shallow-water depth information for island areas is crucial for maritime safety, resource exploration, ecological conservation, and offshore economic activity. Traditional approaches like shipborne sounding and airborne bathymetric light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys are expensive, time-consuming, and are limited in politically sensitive regions. Moreover, satellite altimetry-predicted depths exhibit large errors over shallow waters. In contrast, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), estimated from multispectral imagery, provides a rapid, open source, and cost-effective technique to fully characterize the bathymetry of a region. Given the scarcity of in-situ water-depth data for the South China Sea (SCS), a shallow-water depth model, HHU24SWDSCS, was developed by integrating 1298 Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) tracks with 70 Sentinel-2 multispectral images. The model covers >120 islands and reefs in the SCS, with a resolution of 10 m. Validation against independent ICESat-2 depth data produced a root mean square error for the model of 0.81–1.35 m (<5 % of the maximum depth), with an average coefficient of determination of 0.91. Validation against independent airborne LiDAR bathymetry data revealed an accuracy of 1.01 m for the Lingyang Reef. Further comparisons with existing bathymetry models revealed the superior performance of the model. While the existing bathymetry models exhibit errors up to tens of meters or larger for island regions, and should therefore be used with caution, the HHU24SWDSCS model exhibited good accuracy in shallow waters across the SCS. This model thus provides a reference for mapping shallow-water depth close to islands and provides fundamental support for research in oceanography, geodesy, and other disciplines."

However, the underlying mechanism regarding how phosphate influences the environmental behavior of FeS, especially during the FeS oxygenation in aquatic systems, remains in its fancy. This study for the first time reported that the presence of phosphate, even at a low concentration of 0.3 mM, significantly promoted the FeS-mediated O2 activation and thus the pollutant degradation. The enhancement was attributed to a substantial increase in the generation of •OH, as evidenced by the electron paramagnetic resonance tests and the identification of the probing products. A combination of experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that phosphate adsorbed onto the FeS surface via a monodentate mononuclear configuration, establishing an acidic microenvironment on the FeS surface. Such acidic microenvironment not only increased the utilization efficiency of Fe(II) toward H2O2 generation (i.e., O2+2H++2Fe(II)→H2O2+2Fe(III)), but also prevented the subsequent side reaction of H2O2 self-decomposition (i.e., H2O2+OH−→HO2−+H2O).

We combine thermodynamic considerations and particle-morphology-dependent kinetic rate equations under full consideration of the aqueous phase in disequilibrium with one or more of the forming minerals. The new model predicts the rate of amorphous 2-line ferrihydrite precipitation, dissolution, and overall transformation to crystalline goethite. It is found that the precipitation of goethite (i) occurs from solution and (ii) is limited by the comparatively slow dissolution of the first forming amorphous phase 2-line ferrihydrite. A generalized transformation mechanism further illustrates that differences in the kinetics of Fe(III) precipitation are controlled by the coordination environment of the predominant Fe(III) hydrolysis product.

The Lorenz Energy Cycle (LEC) in the Taiwan Earth System Model Version 1 (TaiESM1) historical simulation is calculated and compared with ERA5 to evaluate the model performance from the thermodynamic aspect. The future change of LEC is accessed by comparing the SSP5‐8.5 and historical simulations in TaiESM1. TaiESM1 reasonably simulates the global mean, seasonal cycle, and spatial patterns of the energy reservoirs with larger values in the mean energy components and smaller in the eddy energy components. The energy cycle in TaiESM1 is about 35%–45% stronger than ERA5, except from December to February. The impact of global warming on the LEC is different at the vertical levels. The influence of meridional temperature gradient change is the dominant factor in the intensity of the energy cycle, and the change in static stability only contributes to the lower troposphere. Lifting the tropopause in the tropics increases the meridional temperature gradient and produces more zonal mean potential energy (PM) in the upper troposphere. PM is the primary driver of the LEC and leads to a more active energy cycle in the upper troposphere. As the tropical tropospheric depth increases and the mid‐latitude eddy activities become more active, more (less) energy is stored in the upper (lower) troposphere, and the energy conversion processes tend to become stronger (weaker) in the upper (lower) troposphere."

Flerchinger,Diurnal Soil Freeze‐Thaw Cycles and the Factors Determining Their Changes in Warming Climate in the Upper Brahmaputra Basin of the Tibetan Plateau,"
Soil freeze‐thaw cycles play a critical role in ecosystem, hydrological and biogeochemical processes, and climate. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has the largest area of frozen soil that undergoes freeze‐thaw cycles in the low‐mid latitudes. Evidence suggests ongoing changes in seasonal freeze‐thaw cycles during the past several decades on the TP. However, the status of diurnal freeze‐thaw cycles (DFTC) of shallow soil and their response to climate change largely remain unknown. In this study, using in‐situ observations, the latest reanalysis, machine learning, and physics‐based modeling, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the spatiotemporal variations of DFTC and their response to climate change in the upper Brahmaputra (UB) basin. About 24 ± 8% of the basin is subjected to DFTC with a mean frequency of 87 ± 55 days during 1980–2018. The area and frequency of DFTC show small long‐term changes during 1980–2018. Air temperature impacts on the frequency of DFTC changes center mainly around the freezing point (0°C). The spatial variations in the response of DFTC to air temperature can primarily be explained by three factors: precipitation (30.4%), snow depth (22.6%) and seasonal warming/cooling rates (14.9%). Both rainfall and snow events reduce diurnal fluctuations of soil temperature, subsequently reducing DFTC frequency, primarily by decreasing daytime temperature through evaporation‐cooling and albedo‐cooling effects, respectively. These results provide an in‐depth understanding of diurnal soil freeze‐thaw status and its response to climate change."

The land thermal condition of Tibetan Plateau (TP), usually with climate memory ranging from weeks to seasons, has been seen as a potential predictability source for subseasonal prediction. Aiming at 2020 record‐breaking Mei‐yu rainfall, this study attempts to investigate whether and how the influence of initial TP surface thermal condition near late June influences the July rainfall prediction over the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Region (MLYR), based on two contrasting prediction experiments using a global climate ensemble prediction system. The results show that the most distinguishable change in the downstream prediction in July is the anomalous low‐tropospheric cyclone and the associated increased rainfall over MLYR corresponding to the warmer initial condition of surface TP. Influenced by the invasion of the positive potential vorticity (PV) center that generated over TP and propagated eastward, this low‐level cyclone anomaly over MLYR is formed within the first week of prediction, and persists for the next 3 weeks maintained by the positive feedback between the low‐level cyclone and middle‐tropospheric latent heating over MLYR in the prediction.

Eleven energy‐related uncertainties are systematically varied, representing national mitigation pledges, institutional factors, and techno‐economic parameters, among others. The resulting ensemble maps how uncertainties impact common energy system metrics used to characterize national and global pathways toward deep decarbonization. Results show globally consistent but regionally variable energy transitions as measured by multiple metrics, including electricity costs and stranded assets. Larger economies and developing regions experience more severe economic outcomes across a broad sampling of uncertainty. The scale of CO2 removal globally determines how much the energy system can continue to emit, but the relative role of different CO2 removal options in meeting decarbonization goals varies across regions. Previous studies characterizing uncertainty have typically focused on a few scenarios, and other large‐ensemble work has not (to our knowledge) combined this framework with national emissions pledges or institutional factors.

 Allergic diseases, affecting over a quarter of individuals in industrialized countries, have become significant public health concerns1,2. The high-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (FcεRI), mainly present on mast cells and basophils, plays a crucial role in allergic diseases3-5. Monomeric IgE binding to FcεRI regulates mast cell survival, differentiation, and maturation6-8. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that, prior to IgE binding, FcεRI mostly exists as a homo-dimer on human mast cell membrane. The structure of human FcεRI confirms the dimeric organization, with each promoter comprising one α subunit, one β subunit, and two γ subunits. The transmembrane helices of the α subunits form a layered arrangement with those of the γ and β subunits. The dimeric interface is mediated by a four-helix bundle of the α and γ subunits at the intracellular juxtamembrane region. Cholesterol-like molecules embedded within the transmembrane domain may stabilize the dimeric assembly. Upon IgE binding, the dimeric FcεRI dissociates into two protomers, each binding to an IgE molecule. Importantly, this process elicits transcriptional activation of Egr1/3 and Ccl2 in rat basophils, which can be attenuated by inhibiting the FcεRI dimer-to-monomer transition. Collectively, our study unveils the mechanism of antigen-independent, IgE-mediated FcεRI activation."

 Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) gene therapy (GT) may provide lifelong reconstitution of the hematopoietic system with gene-corrected cells1. However, the effects of underlying genetic diseases, replication stress, and aging on hematopoietic reconstitution and lineage specification remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed hematopoietic reconstitution in 53 patients treated with lentiviral-HSC-GT for diverse conditions such as metachromatic leukodystrophy2,3 (MLD), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome4,5 (WAS), and β-thalassemia6 (β-Thal) over a follow-up period of up to 8 years, using vector integration sites as markers of clonal identity. We found that long-term hematopoietic reconstitution was supported by 770 to 35,000 active HSCs. While 50% of transplanted clones demonstrated multilineage potential across all conditions, the remaining clones exhibited a disease-specific preferential lineage output and long-term commitment: myeloid for MLD, lymphoid for WAS, and erythroid for β-Thal, particularly in adult patients. Our results indicate that HSC clonogenic activity, lineage output, long-term lineage commitment, and rates of somatic mutations are influenced by the underlying disease, patient age at the time of therapy, the extent of genetic defect correction, and the hematopoietic stress imposed by the inherited disease. This suggests that HSCs adapt to the pathological condition during hematopoietic reconstitution."

 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a newly discovered class of extragalactic radio transients characterized by their high energy and short duration (from microseconds to milliseconds)1. The physical origin of these FRBs remains unknown and is a subject of ongoing research, with magnetars emerging as leading candidates2,3. Previous studies have used various methodologies to address the problem of FRB origin, including demographic analyses of FRB host galaxies and their local environments4–6, assessments of FRB rate evolution with redshift7–9 and searches for proposed multi-messenger FRB counterparts10. However, these studies are susceptible to substantial biases stemming from unaccounted radio and optical selection effects. Here we present empirical evidence for a substantial selection bias against detecting FRBs in galaxies with large inclination angles (edge-on) using a sample of hosts identified for FRBs discovered by untargeted surveys. This inclination-related bias probably leads to a significant underestimation (by about a factor of two) of the FRB rates reported in the literature and disfavours globular clusters as the dominant origin of FRB sources, as previously speculated6. These conclusions have important implications for FRB progenitor models and targeted FRB follow-up strategies. We further investigate the impact of this bias on the relative rate of FRBs in different host environments. Our analysis suggests that scattering in FRB hosts is probably responsible for the observed bias11,12. However, a larger sample of localized FRBs is required to robustly quantify the contribution of scattering to the inclination-related selection bias. The chances of detecting fast radio bursts from a galaxy may be affected by its inclination angle, showing a potential selection bias in determining the sources of the bursts."

 Low soil moisture and high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) cause plant water stress and lead to a variety of drought responses, including a reduction in transpiration and photosynthesis1,2. When soils dry below critical soil moisture thresholds, ecosystems transition from energy to water limitation as stomata close to alleviate water stress3,4. However, the mechanisms behind these thresholds remain poorly defined at the ecosystem scale. Here, by analysing observations of critical soil moisture thresholds globally, we show the prominent role of soil texture in modulating the onset of ecosystem water limitation through the soil hydraulic conductivity curve, whose steepness increases with sand fraction. This clarifies how ecosystem sensitivity to VPD versus soil moisture is shaped by soil texture, with ecosystems in sandy soils being relatively more sensitive to soil drying, whereas ecosystems in clayey soils are relatively more sensitive to VPD. For the same reason, plants in sandy soils have limited potential to adjust to water limitations, which has an impact on how climate change affects terrestrial ecosystems. In summary, although vegetation–atmosphere exchanges are driven by atmospheric conditions and mediated by plant adjustments, their fate is ultimately dependent on the soil. Through their effects on soil hydraulic properties, soil texture and sand content are shown to have broad implications for the terrestrial water cycle and carbon sink, and specific implications for vital ecosystems that are vulnerable to drought, especially with changing climate."

 Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic text, often indistinguishable from human-written content, at a scale that can markedly affect the nature of the information ecosystem1–3. Watermarking can help identify synthetic text and limit accidental or deliberate misuse4, but has not been adopted in production systems owing to stringent quality, detectability and computational efficiency requirements. Here we describe SynthID-Text, a production-ready text watermarking scheme that preserves text quality and enables high detection accuracy, with minimal latency overhead. SynthID-Text does not affect LLM training and modifies only the sampling procedure; watermark detection is computationally efficient, without using the underlying LLM. To enable watermarking at scale, we develop an algorithm integrating watermarking with speculative sampling, an efficiency technique frequently used in production systems5. Evaluations across multiple LLMs empirically show that SynthID-Text provides improved detectability over comparable methods, and standard benchmarks and human side-by-side ratings indicate no change in LLM capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of watermarking in large-scale-production systems, we conducted a live experiment that assessed feedback from nearly 20 million Gemini6 responses, again confirming the preservation of text quality. We hope that the availability of SynthID-Text7 will facilitate further development of watermarking and responsible use of LLM systems.

 Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue identity, developmental timing and stimulus responses, which collectively define the thousands of unique cell types in the body1–3. While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for these intended purposes has arisen naturally. Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs4–8. Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory code.

 Biobanks aim to improve our understanding of health and disease by collecting and analysing diverse biological and phenotypic information in large samples. So far, biobanks have largely pursued a population-based sampling strategy, where the individual is the unit of sampling, and familial relatedness occurs sporadically and by chance. This strategy has been remarkably efficient and successful, leading to thousands of scientific discoveries across multiple research domains, and plans for the next wave of biobanks are underway. In this Perspective, we discuss the strengths and limitations of a complementary sampling strategy for future biobanks based on oversampling of close genetic relatives. Such family-based samples facilitate research that clarifies causal relationships between putative risk factors and outcomes, particularly in estimates of genetic effects, because they enable analyses that reduce or eliminate confounding due to familial and demographic factors. Family-based biobank samples would also shed new light on fundamental questions across multiple fields that are often difficult to explore in population-based samples. Despite the potential for higher costs and greater analytical complexity, the many advantages of family-based samples should often outweigh their potential challenges.

 Complex multicellularity has emerged independently across a few eukaryotic lineages and is often associated with the rise of elaborate, tightly coordinated developmental processes1,2. How multicellularity and development are interconnected in evolution is a major question in biology. The hourglass model of embryonic evolution depicts how developmental processes are conserved during evolution, and predicts morphological and molecular divergence in early and late embryogenesis, bridged by a conserved mid-embryonic (phylotypic) period linked to the formation of the basic body plan3,4. Initially found in animal embryos5–8, molecular hourglass patterns have recently been proposed for land plants and fungi9,10. However, whether the hourglass pattern is an intrinsic feature of all complex multicellular eukaryotes remains unknown. Here we tested the presence of a molecular hourglass in the brown algae, a eukaryotic lineage that has evolved multicellularity independently from animals, fungi and plants1,11,12. By exploring transcriptome evolution patterns of brown algae with distinct morphological complexities, we uncovered an hourglass pattern during embryogenesis in morphologically complex species. Filamentous algae without canonical embryogenesis display transcriptome conservation in multicellular stages of the life cycle, whereas unicellular stages are more rapidly evolving. Our findings suggest that transcriptome conservation in brown algae is associated with cell differentiation stages, but is not necessarily linked to embryogenesis. Together with previous work in animals, plants and fungi, we provide further evidence for the generality of a developmental hourglass pattern across complex multicellular eukaryotes. Similar to other eukaryotes, brown algae exhibit transcriptome conservation that is consistent with the molecular hourglass model during differentiation in embryonic development."

 Capture of CO2 from the air offers a promising approach to addressing climate change and achieving carbon neutrality goals1,2. However, the development of a durable material with high capacity, fast kinetics and low regeneration temperature for CO2 capture, especially from the intricate and dynamic atmosphere, is still lacking.

 The ability of stony corals to thrive in the oligotrophic (low-nutrient, low-productivity) surface waters of the tropical ocean is commonly attributed to their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates1,2. The evolutionary history of this symbiosis might clarify its organismal and environmental roles3, but its prevalence through time, and across taxa, morphologies and oceanic settings, is currently unclear4–6. Here we report measurements of the nitrogen isotope (15N/14N) ratio of coral-bound organic matter (CB-δ15N) in samples from Mid-Devonian reefs (Givetian, around 385 million years ago), which represent a constraint on the evolution of coral photosymbiosis. Colonial tabulate and fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals have low CB-δ15N values (2.51 ± 0.97‰) in comparison with co-occurring solitary and (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals (5.52 ± 1.63‰). The average of the isotopic difference per deposit (3.01 ± 0.58‰) is statistically indistinguishable from that observed between modern symbiont-barren and symbiont-bearing corals (3.38 ± 1.05‰). On the basis of this evidence, we infer that Mid-Devonian tabulate and some fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals hosted active photosymbionts, while solitary and some (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals did not. The low CB-δ15N values of the Devonian tabulate and fasciculate rugose corals relative to the modern range suggest that Mid-Devonian reefs formed in biogeochemical regimes analogous to the modern oligotrophic subtropical gyres. Widespread oligotrophy during the Devonian may have promoted coral photosymbiosis, the occurrence of which may explain why Devonian reefs were the most productive reef ecosystems of the Phanerozoic.

 Chronic inflammation and tissue fibrosis are common responses that worsen organ function, yet the molecular mechanisms governing their cross-talk are poorly understood. In diseased organs, stress-induced gene expression changes fuel maladaptive cell state transitions1 and pathological interaction between cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction in the lungs, liver, kidneys and heart, and exacerbates many cancers2, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are poorly understood. Here we show that conditional deletion of the transcriptional co-activator Brd4 in infiltrating Cx3cr1+ macrophages ameliorates heart failure in mice and significantly reduces fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1+ cells identified a large enhancer proximal to interleukin-1β (IL-1β, encoded by Il1b), and a series of CRISPR-based deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controls Il1b expression. Secreted IL-1β activated a fibroblast RELA-dependent (also known as p65) enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL-1β neutralization improved cardiac function and tissue fibrosis in heart failure. Systemic IL-1β inhibition or targeted Il1b deletion in Cx3cr1+ cells prevented stress-induced Meox1 expression and fibroblast activation. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent cross-talk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL-1β reveals how inflammation drives profibrotic cell states and supports strategies that modulate this process in heart disease and other chronic inflammatory disorders featuring tissue remodelling.

 Evidence suggests that, when compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars form, they may receive a ‘natal kick’, during which the stellar remnant gains momentum. Observational evidence for neutron star kicks is substantial1,2, yet is limited for black hole natal kicks, and some proposed black hole formation scenarios result in very small kicks3–5. Here we report that the canonical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple with a tertiary companion at least 3,500 astronomical units (au) away from the inner binary. Given the orbital configuration, the black hole probably received a sub-5 km s−1 kick to have avoided unbinding the tertiary. This discovery lends support to the idea that at least some black holes form with nearly no natal kick. Furthermore, the tertiary in this system lends credence to evolutionary models of LMXBs involving a hierarchical triple structure6. Remarkably, the tertiary is evolved, indicating that the system formed 3–5 billion years ago and that the black hole has removed at least half a solar mass of matter from its evolved secondary companion. During the event in which the black hole formed, it is required that at least half of the mass of the black hole progenitor collapsed into the black hole; it may even have undergone a complete implosion, enabling the tertiary to remain loosely bound. Analysis of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary V404 Cygni shows that it is part of a wide hierarchical triple whose configuration provides evidence that some black holes form with nearly no natal kick.  "

 DNA storage has shown potential to transcend current silicon-based data storage technologies in storage density, longevity and energy consumption1–3. However, writing large-scale data directly into DNA sequences by de novo synthesis remains uneconomical in time and cost4. We present an alternative, parallel strategy that enables the writing of arbitrary data on DNA using premade nucleic acids. Through self-assembly guided enzymatic methylation, epigenetic modifications, as information bits, can be introduced precisely onto universal DNA templates to enact molecular movable-type printing. By programming with a finite set of 700 DNA movable types and five templates, we achieved the synthesis-free writing of approximately 275,000 bits on an automated platform with 350 bits written per reaction. The data encoded in complex epigenetic patterns were retrieved high-throughput by nanopore sequencing, and algorithms were developed to finely resolve 240 modification patterns per sequencing reaction. With the epigenetic information bits framework, distributed and bespoke DNA storage was implemented by 60 volunteers lacking professional biolab experience. Our framework presents a new modality of DNA data storage that is parallel, programmable, stable and scalable. Such an unconventional modality opens up avenues towards practical data storage and dual-mode data functions in biomolecular systems.

 Regulated start-codon selection has the potential to reshape the proteome through the differential production of upstream open reading frames, canonical proteins, and alternative translational isoforms1–3. However, conditions under which start codon selection is altered remain poorly defined. Here, using transcriptome-wide translation-initiation-site profiling4, we reveal a global increase in the stringency of start-codon selection during mammalian mitosis. Low-efficiency initiation sites are preferentially repressed in mitosis, resulting in pervasive changes in the translation of thousands of start sites and their corresponding protein products. This enhanced stringency of start-codon selection during mitosis results from increased association between the 40S ribosome and the key regulator of start-codon selection, eIF1. We find that increased eIF1–40S ribosome interaction during mitosis is mediated by the release of a nuclear pool of eIF1 upon nuclear envelope breakdown. Selectively depleting the nuclear pool of eIF1 eliminates the change to translational stringency during mitosis, resulting in altered synthesis of thousands of protein isoforms. In addition, preventing mitotic translational rewiring results in substantially increased cell death and decreased mitotic slippage in cells that experience a mitotic delay induced by anti-mitotic chemotherapies. Thus, cells globally control stringency of translation initiation, which has critical roles during the mammalian cell cycle in preserving mitotic cell physiology. Transcriptome-wide profiling studies in mammalian cells show that the stringency of start-codon selection is increased during mitosis, and that this is regulated by nuclear eIF1 to preserve mitotic arrest physiology."

 Mounting effective immunity against pathogens and tumours relies on the successful metabolic programming of T cells by extracellular fatty acids1–3. Fatty-acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) has a key role in this process by coordinating the efficient import and trafficking of lipids that fuel mitochondrial respiration to sustain the bioenergetic requirements of protective CD8+ T cells4,5. However, the mechanisms that govern this immunometabolic axis remain unexplored. Here we report that the cytoskeletal organizer transgelin 2 (TAGLN2) is necessary for optimal fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial respiration and anticancer function in CD8+ T cells. TAGLN2 interacts with FABP5 to facilitate its cell surface localization and function in activated CD8+ T cells. Analyses of ovarian cancer specimens revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses induced by the tumour microenvironment repress TAGLN2 in infiltrating CD8+ T cells, thereby enforcing their dysfunctional state. Restoring TAGLN2 expression in ER-stressed CD8+ T cells increased their lipid uptake, mitochondrial respiration and cytotoxic capacity. Accordingly, chimeric antigen receptor T cells overexpressing TAGLN2 bypassed the detrimental effects of tumour-induced ER stress and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in mice with metastatic ovarian cancer. Our study establishes the role of cytoskeletal TAGLN2 in T cell lipid metabolism and highlights the potential to enhance cellular immunotherapy in solid malignancies by preserving the TAGLN2–FABP5 axis.

 The T cell response to cancer controls disease progression and response to immunotherapy1–3. Despite extensive knowledge regarding CD8 T cells, how CD4 T cells contribute to this process is less well understood. Here we identified a population of PD1+TCF1+ CD4 T cells with stem-like properties that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into canonical CD4 effector cells. Primarily residing in tumour-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), these tumour-specific CD4 T cells are restricted by T regulatory (Treg) cells to a stem-like fate that predominantly generated induced Treg (iTreg) cells, limiting effector CD8 T cell responses to the tumour. By contrast, upon Treg depletion, stem-like CD4 T cells differentiated into T helper 1 (TH1) cells, and via IFNγ production induced robust effector differentiation from TCF1+ CD8 T cells in TDLNs, a state we defined as ‘active’. Notably, enforcing TBET expression in transferred stem-like CD4 T cells was sufficient to overcome the established restricted T cell state. Despite the presence of Treg cells, endogenous stem-like CD4 T cells actively generated TH1 cells, which were required to restore TDLN effector CD8 T cell differentiation, enhance tumour control and rescue response to immunotherapy. In agreement, TH1 differentiation in patients with kidney cancer predicted successful immunotherapy responses and improved progression-free survival. Together, these findings identify a stem-like CD4 T cell population that through alternative differentiation fates controls the switch between restricted and active T cell states with implications for cancer immunotherapies.

 Neural crest cells are multipotent progenitors that produce defining features of vertebrates such as the ‘new head’1. Here we use the tunicate, Ciona, to explore the evolutionary origins of neural crest since this invertebrate chordate is among the closest living relatives of vertebrates2–4. Previous studies identified two potential neural crest cell types in Ciona, sensory pigment cells and bipolar tail neurons5,6. Recent findings suggest that  bipolar tail neurons are homologous to cranial sensory ganglia rather than derivatives of neural crest7,8. Here we show that the pigment cell lineage also produces neural progenitor cells that form regions of the juvenile nervous system following metamorphosis. Neural progenitors are also a major derivative of neural crest in vertebrates, suggesting that the last common ancestor of tunicates and vertebrates contained a multipotent progenitor population at the neural plate border. It would therefore appear that a key property of neural crest, multipotentiality, preceded the emergence of vertebrates.

 Multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens like vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) are a critical threat to human health1. Daptomycin is a last-resort antibiotic for VREfm infections with a novel mode of action2, but for which resistance has been widely reported but is unexplained. Here we show that rifaximin, an unrelated antibiotic used prophylactically to prevent hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver disease3, causes cross-resistance to daptomycin in VREfm. Amino acid changes arising within the bacterial RNA polymerase in response to rifaximin exposure cause upregulation of a previously uncharacterized operon (prdRAB) that leads to cell membrane remodelling and cross-resistance to daptomycin through reduced binding of the antibiotic. VREfm with these mutations are spread globally, making this a major mechanism of resistance. Rifaximin has been considered ‘low risk’ for the development of antibiotic resistance. Our study shows that this assumption is flawed and that widespread rifaximin use, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis, may be compromising the clinical use of daptomycin, a major last-resort intervention for multidrug-resistant pathogens. These findings demonstrate how unanticipated antibiotic cross-resistance can undermine global strategies designed to preserve the clinical use of critical antibiotics.

 Inflammation and tissue fibrosis co-exist and are causally linked to organ dysfunction1,2. However, the molecular mechanisms driving immune–fibroblast cell communication in human cardiac disease remain unexplored and there are at present no approved treatments that directly target cardiac fibrosis3,4. Here we performed multiomic single-cell gene expression, epitope mapping and chromatin accessibility profiling in 45 healthy donor, acutely infarcted and chronically failing human hearts. We identified a disease-associated fibroblast trajectory that diverged into distinct populations reminiscent of myofibroblasts and matrifibrocytes, the latter expressing fibroblast activator protein (FAP) and periostin (POSTN). Genetic lineage tracing of FAP+ fibroblasts in vivo showed that they contribute to the POSTN lineage but not the myofibroblast lineage. We assessed the applicability of experimental systems to model cardiac fibroblasts and demonstrated that three different in vivo mouse models of cardiac injury were superior compared with cultured human heart and dermal fibroblasts in recapitulating the human disease phenotype. Ligand–receptor analysis and spatial transcriptomics predicted that interactions between C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) macrophages and fibroblasts mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signalling drove the emergence of FAP/POSTN fibroblasts within spatially defined niches. In vivo, we deleted the IL-1 receptor on fibroblasts and the IL-1β ligand in CCR2+ monocytes and macrophages, and inhibited IL-1β signalling using a monoclonal antibody, and showed reduced FAP/POSTN fibroblasts, diminished myocardial fibrosis and improved cardiac function. These findings highlight the broader therapeutic potential of targeting inflammation to treat tissue fibrosis and preserve organ function.

 Aqueous redox flow batteries with halide-based catholytes (where the halogen atom (X) is Br or I) are promising for sustainable grid energy storage. However, the formation of polyhalides during electrochemical charging and the associated phase separation into X2 limits the operable state of charge (SoC), results in vaporization and self-discharge inefficiencies, and spurs complete device failure1–3. Here we introduce soft–hard zwitterionic trappers (SH-ZITs) as complexing agents composed of a polyhalide-complexing ‘soft’ cationic motif and a water-soluble ‘hard’ anionic motif to enable homogeneous halide cycling. More than 300 structures were designed and 13 were characterized, showcasing the ability to complex polyhalides in homogeneous aqueous solution, to deter cation-exchange membrane crossover and to alter the electrochemical electrode mechanism. In flow battery cycling at a standard catholyte SoC of 66.6 per cent (stoichiometrically X3–), an average coulombic efficiency of more than 99.9 per cent at 40 milliamperes per square centimetre with no apparent decay was observed after more than 1,000 cycles over 2 months, with stability at elevated temperatures also demonstrated. Interestingly, SH-ZITs enable homogeneous cycling of the halide catholyte up to 90 per cent SoC at 2 moles per litre (47.7 ampere-hours per litre) for bromide, revealing previously unknown polyhalide regimes to be studied. Ultimately, SH-ZIT enables ultrahigh catholyte capacity utilization up to over 120 ampere-hours per litre at 80 per cent SoC with homogeneous cycling as well as the ability to pair with a zinc anode in a hybrid flow battery.

 The brain processes an array of stimuli, enabling the selection of appropriate behavioural responses, but the neural pathways linking interoceptive inputs to outputs for feeding are poorly understood1–3. Here we delineate a subcortical circuit in which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) directly connect interoceptive inputs to motor centres, controlling food consumption and jaw movements. VMHBDNF neuron inhibition increases food intake by gating motor sequences of feeding through projections to premotor areas of the jaw. When food is unavailable, VMHBDNF inhibition elicits consummatory behaviours directed at inanimate objects such as wooden blocks, and inhibition of perimesencephalic trigeminal area (pMe5) projections evokes rhythmic jaw movements. The activity of these neurons is decreased during food consumption and increases when food is in proximity but not consumed. Activity is also increased in obese animals and after leptin treatment. VMHBDNF neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from both agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc), and constitutive VMHBDNF activation blocks the orexigenic effect of AgRP activation. These data indicate an Arc → VMHBDNF → pMe5 circuit that senses the energy state of an animal and regulates consummatory behaviours in a state-dependent manner.

 The contribution of the soil microbes to agroecosystem multifunctionality under global change remains poorly understood. Here, based on data from a field experiment involving elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and warming in a rice-wheat agroecosystem, we found that soil microbes influence the impact of climate change on agroecosystem functions. The stability of food production during the rice season increased under elevated CO2 but decreased under warming, with no significant changes in the wheat season. The interactive influences of elevated CO2 and warming on agroecosystem multifunctionality were found to be minimal. The abundance of soil fungi and nematode was associated with agroecosystem stability during the rice and wheat seasons, respectively.

 A marsh-fronted seawall is a hybrid nature-based coastal protection solution because it attenuates wave energy, reduces erosion, and provides ecosystem services. However, we still have a limited understanding of how to quantify the marsh wave attenuation benefits for economic analysis. Here, we incorporate a prediction of wave attenuation that accounts for species-specific morphology and structural stiffness into a 1-D wave model and validate it with field measurements. Our results show that the wave attenuation varies by a factor of two across different vegetation species. Further, we performed a benefit-cost analysis, in which the economic benefits represent the environmental services value and avoided seawall heightening cost that would otherwise be required to deliver the same overtopping rate without vegetation. We applied the model to a real-world, marsh-fronted seawall design at Juniper Cove, Massachusetts. Although the benefit of marsh-fronted seawalls is sensitive to discount rate, they have benefit-cost ratios greater than one, indicating that it is an economically justified nature-based solution. Further, we found that wave attenuation and benefit-cost ratio are more sensitive to water depth than wave height. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering the coastal protection of marshes and economic benefits in one framework.

 Extreme warm water events, known as marine heatwaves, cause a variety of adverse impacts on the marine ecosystem. They are occurring more and more frequently across the global ocean. Yet monitoring marine heatwaves below the sea surface is still challenging due to the sparsity of in situ temperature observations. Here, we propose a statistical learning method guided by ocean dynamics and optimal prediction theory, to detect subsurface marine heatwaves based on the observable sea surface temperature and sea surface height. This dynamics-guided statistical learning method shows good skills in detecting subsurface marine heatwaves in the oceanic epipelagic zone over many parts of the global ocean. It outperforms both the classical ordinary least square regression and popular deep learning methods that do not effectively exploit ocean dynamics, with clear dynamical interpretation for its outperformance. Our study provides a useful statistical learning method for near real-time monitoring of subsurface marine heatwaves at a global scale and highlights the importance of exploiting ocean dynamics for enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of statistical learning.

 This paper describes an approach to analyze ground deformation data collected by InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) imaging the volcano feeding system (VFS) beneath a caldera. The approach is applied to the Campi Flegrei caldera in southern Italy, a densely populated area at high risk for volcanic eruption. The method is a 4D tomographic inversion that considers a combination of 3D pressure sources and dislocations (strike-slip, dip-slip and tensile) acting simultaneously. This is in contrast to traditional methods that assume a priori geometries and type for the volcanic source. Another novelty is that we carry out a time-series analysis of multifrequency InSAR displacement data. The analysis of these multiplatform and multifrequency InSAR data from 2011 to 2022 reveals an inflating source at a depth of 3–4 km that is interpreted as a pressurized magmatic intrusion. The source broadens and migrates laterally over time, with a possible new magmatic pulse arriving in 2018–2020. The model also identifies a shallow region (at 400 m depth) that may be feeding fumaroles in the area.

 Land surface temperature (LST) is the key parameter for characterizing the water and energy balance of the Earth’ surface. At present, thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing provides the most efficient way to obtain accurate LST regionally and globally. Among existing satellites, the Landsat-9 could observe the Earth's surface via two TIR channels, making it possible to generate the global LST product with a remarkable spatial resolution of 100 m. Currently, the single channel method and split window method generally were used to recover LST from the Landsat-9 TIR measurements. However, accurate land surface emissivity (LSE) is needed in both algorithms, which is very difficult to obtain at the pixel scale. To overcome this issue, an improved LST and LSE separation method was proposed in this study. Firstly, the traditional water vapor scaling (WVS) method was refined to address the atmospheric effects in the satellite measurements. Then, the traditional temperature and emissivity separation method (TES) was adapted to the Landsat-9 observations with only two TIR channels. Finally, an iterative process was designed to retrieve the LST and LSE simultaneously. Validations using in-situ measured LST indicated that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the retrieved LST was around 2.92 K, outperforming the official Landsat-9 LST product with an RMSE of about 4.20 K. Taking ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) products as the references, the RMSE of our retrieved LST and LSE was found to be < 1.55 K and < 0.015, respectively. Overall, conclusions can be made that the proposed method was able to retrieve accurate LST and LSE simultaneously from the Landsat-9 TIR measurements with high spatial resolution, which may greatly facilitate the relevant applications."

 Fusion of hyperspectral image (HSI) and multispectral image (MSI) is a prevalent scheme to generate a HSI with enhanced spatial resolution. Current methods often fail to sufficiently leverage the effective spectral and spatial priors existing in the observed HSI and MSI to further enhance the fusion performance. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel HSI-MSI fusion approach, which integrates Sparse and Low Rank with a CNN denoiser (SLRCNN) while considering spectral dictionary optimization. Firstly, an initialized spectral dictionary is derived from the HSI. Next, the spatial coefficients optimization model is established by incorporating the sparse prior, local low-rank prior, and plugged image prior simultaneously, where the l1 norm is imposed to promote the sparse prior, and the super-pixel segmentation strategy is conducted on the MSI to impose the local low-rank prior while a well-trained CNN denoiser is plugged in to enforce the image prior. Then, the spectral dictionary optimization model is constructed to refine the initial spectral dictionary, capturing more detailed spectral characteristics to further improve the fusion results. Finally, the optimization process involves applying the split-augmented Lagrangian shrinkage method and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets, namely the Pavia University dataset, the Indian Pines dataset, and the EO-1 dataset, indicate that SLRCNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches at 4x, 5x, and 6x resolutions in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results. Specifically, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of SLRCNN is improved by more than 0.9 dB, 0.9 dB, and 0.2 dB while the spectral angle mapper (SAM) is decreased by more than 0.1, 0.2, and 0.2 in degree compared to other state-of-the-art methods across three datasets, respectively, which underscores the effectiveness of SLRCNN in leveraging both spatial detail reconstruction and spectral preservation."

 Population growth and agricultural intensification lead to stress on landscapes that are highly sensitive to land-use changes. An increase in irrigation-triggered landslides (ITL) in dry climates has negative impacts on local communities. However, evolution and global impacts of ITL are little-known. Here, we use Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR), vectorization, and differential method to study surface deformation, ground displacement, and changes in headscarp morphology and topography in regions prone to ITL, aiming to uncover the evolution and spatiotemporal distribution of ITL. Findings show that the most severe surface deformation of ITL occurs on the landslide body. Meanwhile, the ITL displacement curve indicates the ITL will maintain continuous movement for at least 7 years, while ancient ITL also poses a threat. Moreover, the headscarp of ITL shows lateral expansion and longitudinal retrogression on the horizontal ground, whereby the scale of expansion is greater than that of retrogression, which transforms landslides into landslide clusters. Finally, the topographic changes further reveal that the main development pattern of ITL is lateral expansion. We suggest that the frequency and disaster-causing ability of ITL will increase greatly with further population growth and related intensification in the agricultural sector."

 Climate change caused by rapid urbanization in the Guanzhong region of China is becoming an increasingly significant problem. Previous empirical studies have confirmed that landscape patterns inextricably linked with the thermal environment, but static results based on a single temporal cross section of image data provide only a partial understanding. In this paper, we constructed a dynamic framework using Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) for temperature simulation and Geodetector to study the landscape factors and their interactions that influence near-surface temperature (NST) changes in the Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA) between 2000 and 2020. Results showed that the GPUA average NST increased by 0.012 °C and 0.053 °C in January and July from 2000 to 2020, respectively. In terms of the dynamic correlation between landscape patterns and NST, cropland (CPL) was negative, urban land (UBL) was positive, and the remainder of the landscapes differed in winter and summer. Furthermore, results from the Geodetector showed that UBL embodied a stronger influence in summer than during winter months. This finding helps to explain why the average NST increase is higher in summer than during winter. The Dynamic Q values (DQ) of the area-based landscape metrics were generally larger than those of other spatial configuration metrics, and the interaction results showed that the landscape metrics of various land-cover classifications were enhanced, indicating that the superposition effect among landscape metrics needs to be taken into account in landscape planning in addition to area factors. The study of the relationship between landscape patterns and thermal environment considering dynamic perspective using WRF offers an important theoretical reference allied with practical guidance for understanding and adapting to forthcoming change in our climate through which we can help drive sustainable development decisions of the GPUA."

 Increasing trends in allergic respiratory diseases may be linked to climate changes affecting pollen levels. This study aimed to investigate the temporal trends in seasonal indexes of 9 allergenic pollen types in the Veneto Region, Northern Italy. Available daily data from 20 monitoring stations covered 2001–2022 for Corylaceae, Cupressaceae, Poaceae, Oleaceae, and Urticaceae (pollen families), and 2006–2022 for Alnus, Betula, Ambrosia, and Artemisia (pollen genera). The 95-percentage method was used to identify the start/end dates of pollen seasons annually, and the seasonal cumulative pollen concentration (Seasonal Pollen Integral, SPIn) was calculated. The non-parametric Theil-Sen median slope method was used to examine trends in pollen seasons’ start day, duration, and SPIn in the whole region and for climatic areas (alpine, subcontinental eastern, subcontinental western). The results showed a clear upward trend in SPIn for several pollens, with median slopes ranging from 326 (Alnus) to 1089 p/m3 per 10yrs (Corylaceae); exceptions were Artemisia, whose SPIn decreased over time (−26 p/m3 per 10yrs), and Ambrosia, Betula, and Urticaceae, which did not show a clear trend. For families, pollen seasons showed a trend for anticipation (from −4.7, Urticaceae, to −13.5 days/10yrs, Oleaceae) and extended duration (from 8.3, Cupressaceae, to 13.3 days/10yrs, Oleaceae). An evident heterogeneity across the climatic areas was seen for the SPIn, with the subcontinental western area exhibiting the highest loads and most prominent increases over time. In conclusion, increased levels and prolonged seasons for several pollen taxa observed in the Veneto Region, particularly in subcontinental areas, suggest increasing risks for individuals with pollen allergies. Addressing this issue requires measures of mitigation and adaptation to climate-driven changes in pollen exposure."

 Since 2017, the SINFONY (Seamless INtegrated FOrecastiNg sYstem) project has been under development at the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD). It is aimed to provide a seamless ensemble system for early predictions and warnings of severe weather events by combining the nowcasting based on extrapolating observed radar reflectivity and short-term forecasts initiated from the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) of data assimilation for the convection-permitting ICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydtostatic) model. So far, the ICON-RUC setup has been extensively tested for convective summer cases. In this study, a series of sensitivity experiments have been conducted for the winter precipitation, including the choice of microphysics schemes and the Latent Heat Nudging (LHN). Results show that within data assimilation cycles the two-moment scheme outperforms the one-moment scheme, and the LHN has also positive impacts. For the 6-h reflectivity forecasts, the two-moment scheme is clearly better than the one-moment scheme and the added values by using the LHN persist almost 6 h. For the precipitation forecasts, the two-moment scheme also exhibits advantage for the light precipitation, however, for the moderate precipitation, the one-moment scheme prevails.

 The present study quantifies the improvement achieved in lightning forecast skill of the NCMRWF regional ensemble prediction system (NEPS-R) compared to its deterministic counterpart (CNTL). The lightning forecasts over study regions of East and Northeast India (ENEI) and Peninsular India (PI) during the pre-monsoon season and Central-East and Northeast India (CENEI) during the monsoon season have been verified using lightning observations from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Lightning Detection Network (LDN). The persisting systematic negative bias in deterministic and EPS-based forecasts of the ensemble mean (EnsMean) and ensemble maximum (EnsMax) indicate the lack of spread among the members, supported by the low values of ensemble spread over all the study regions. EnsMean has the lowest RMSE, with a decrease in error ranging from 0.8 % to 2.18 % compared to CNTL. Categorical skill scores indicate that the EPS-based forecasts (EnsMean and EnsMax) are more skillful than the deterministic forecast at all thresholds and lead times. Further, Fractions Skill Score (FSS) establishes the superiority of the ensemble forecasts over the deterministic forecasts, where for threshold >1, EnsMean is skillful at comparatively smaller neighborhood sizes (ENEI and PI ∼68 km; CENEI ∼36 km for day-1) than CNTL (ENEI-116 km; PI-196 km; CENEI-68 km). EnsMax at higher thresholds (>5 and >10) is skillful at lesser neighborhood sizes ranging from 116 to 276 km compared to CNTL (>401 km) for day-1. Hence, skillful re-scaled EPS forecasts based on FSS could provide better guidance for the forecasters. The Continuous Ranked Probability Score of EPS forecasts is lower by around 9 % than the Mean Absolute Error of CNTL forecasts, and the ROC of EPS shows better discrimination of events and non-events compared to CNTL. These highlight the merits of using an EPS over a deterministic system for forecasting a field of high spatial variability, like lightning, and thereby, the use of vast computational resources to run a convective scale EPS is justified."

Increasing DC in ORBs prohibits the SEF. 
 In this study, the role of diabatic heating/cooling in outer rainbands (ORBs) in the formation and evolution of the secondary eyewall of a numerically simulated tropical cyclone (TC) is investigated. This is done through a series of sensitivity experiments under idealized conditions using a high-resolution cloud-resolving atmospheric model. The results show that artificially increasing diabatic heating in rainbands enhances convective activities in ORBs and leads to an earlier secondary eyewall formation (SEF), and later the faster weakening and earlier dissipation of the primary eyewall. Reducing diabatic heating in ORBs weakens the rainbands and delays the SEF but prolongs the duration of the double eyewall structure if the SEF occurs. Reducing diabatic cooling in ORBs enhances convective activity in rainbands but has little effect on convection in the primary eyewall prior to the SEF. However, it results in a widened eyewall structure and a stronger TC after the eyewall replacement. Increasing diabatic cooling in ORBs largely suppresses convection in rainbands and prohibits the SEF. These results demonstrate that diabatic heating/cooling in ORBs plays important roles in the SEF and evolution. Since diabatic heating/cooling in rainbands is sensitive to the near-core environmental relative humidity, our results demonstrate the critical importance of large-scale environmental moist condition to the formation and evolution of secondary eyewall in TCs. In addition, it is also found that when the area-averaged diabatic heating rate in ORBs becomes similar in magnitude to that in the primary eyewall, the secondary eyewall forms.Plain language summaryPrevious studies have demonstrated the importance of diabatic heating/cooling in outer rainbands to the structure and intensity changes of tropical cyclones (TCs) with a single eyewall. It is unclear whether and how diabatic heating/cooling in outer rainbands may affect the formation and evolution of the secondary eyewall in TCs. These issues have been addressed based on a series of sensitivity experiments under idealized conditions using a high-resolution atmospheric model. Results show that diabatic heating in outer rainbands is favorable for the secondary eyewall formation (SEF). Increasing diabatic heating in outer eyewall can lead to faster weakening and thus earlier dissipation of the primary eyewall. Diabatic cooling in outer rainbands suppresses convection in outer rainbands and prohibits the SEF. Since diabatic heating/cooling in outer rainbands is sensitive to the near-core environmental relative humidity, our results demonstrate the importance of the large-scale environmental moist condition to the SEF of TCs. We also found that when the area-averaged diabatic heating rate in outer rainbands becomes similar in magnitude to that in the primary eyewall, the secondary eyewall would form, which can be considered as a measure of the SEF in TCs.Key points1.Increasing diabatic heating in outer rainbands leads to earlier SEF, and faster weakening and earlier dissipation of the primary eyewall.2.Increasing diabatic cooling in outer rainbands suppresses convective activity in outer rainbands and is unfavorable for the SEF.3.When the area-averaged diabatic heating rate in outer rainbands and the eyewall become similar in magnitude, the secondary eyewall forms."

Sustained through-plane (TP) alignment of nanochannels was proposed as a remedy but proved challenging. We report an anisotropic composite PEM, mimicking the water-conductive composite structure of bamboo that meets this challenge. Micro- and nanoscale alignment of conductive pathways is achieved by in-plane thermal compression of a mat composed of co-electrospun Nafion and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers stabilizing the alignment. This translates to pronounced TP-enhanced proton conductivity, twice that of pure Nafion at high humidity, 13 times larger at low humidity, and 10 times larger water diffusivity. This remarkable improvement is elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that stronger nanochannels alignment upon dehydration compensates for reduced water content.

Here, we decode the errors associated with writing and shifting domain walls using nanosecond current pulses in a ~5-micrometer-wide wire composed of a Pt/GdFeCo bilayer. We find that writing a domain wall at the edge of the wire causes a bit positioning error of ~0.3 micrometers, whereas the shifting process induces an error of ~0.1 micrometers per a 2-nanosecond-long current pulse. The error correlation among successive shifting is negligible when the current drive is sufficiently large.

What do our brains detect in the first few hundred milliseconds after seeing such a stimulus? We flashed short sentences during magnetoencephalography measurement, revealing sentence-sensitive neural activity in left temporal cortex within 130 milliseconds. These signals emerged for subject-verb-object sentences regardless of grammatical or semantic well-formedness, suggesting that at-a-glance language comprehension begins by detecting basic phrase structure, independent of meaning or other grammatical details.

At overdose levels, opioid-induced respiratory depression becomes fatal without the administration of naloxone within minutes. Currently, overdose survival relies on bystander intervention, requiring a nearby person to find the overdosed individual and have immediate access to naloxone to administer. To circumvent the bystander requirement, we developed the Naloximeter: a class of life-saving implantable devices that autonomously detect and treat overdose while simultaneously contacting first responders. We present three Naloximeter platforms, for fundamental research and clinical translation, all equipped with optical sensors, drug delivery mechanisms, and a supporting ecosystem of technology to counteract opioid-induced respiratory depression. In small and large animal studies, the Naloximeter rescues from otherwise fatal opioid overdose within minutes. This work introduces life-changing, clinically translatable technologies that can broadly benefit a susceptible population recovering from opioid use disorder."

Here, we propose and test a framework that integrates economic multifunctionality, encompassing timber production–oriented goals and resistance against disturbances, with multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality in European beech forest stands enriched with conifers. Our results show that enriched beech forest stands (~80 years old) can provide high levels of economic multifunctionality without compromising multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality.

We address the issue of decoherence due to spontaneous decay and show that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in conjunction with a correlated measurement and nonlinear estimation strategy, achieve gains of up to 2.25 decibel, comparable to fundamental bounds for up to about 80 atoms in the presence of decoherence. This result is unexpected because GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing due to white frequency noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events. Through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations of atomic clocks, we demonstrate the robustness of the GHZ protocol."

Here, we propose an alternative approach to solve the electronic structure problem using VQE with a single qudit. Our approach exploits a high-dimensional orbital angular momentum state of a heralded single photon and notably reduces the required quantum resources compared to conventional multi-qubit–based VQE. We experimentally demonstrate that our single-qudit–based VQE can efficiently estimate the ground state energy of hydrogen (H2) and lithium hydride (LiH) molecular systems corresponding to two- and four-qubit systems, respectively.

Because of eigenstate broadening on solid substrates, resolving low-frequency vibronic states demands strong decoupling.

This strategy enables the successful identification of the lowest-frequency Hg(ω1) (Raman-active Hgmode) vibronic excitation within single C60molecules, which, despite being notably pronounced in electron transport of C60single-molecule transistors, has remained hidden at submolecular level. Our results show that the observed Hg(ω1) excitation is “anchored” to all molecules, irrespective of local geometry, challenging common understanding of structural definition of vibronic excitation governed by Franck-Condon principle. Density functional theory calculations reveal existence of molecule-substrate interfacial charge-transfer dipole, which, although overlooked previously, drives the dominant Hg(ω1) excitation.

In this misguided repair process, activated fibroblasts drive the destruction of organ architecture by accumulating and contracting extracellular matrix.

We show that direct contact with profibrotic but not proinflammatory macrophages triggers acute fibroblast contractions. The contractile response depends on αvβ3 integrin expression on macrophages and Piezo1 expression on fibroblasts. The touch of macrophages elevates fibroblast cytosolic calcium within seconds, followed by translocation of the transcription cofactors nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 and Yes-associated protein, which drive fibroblast activation within hours. Intriguingly, macrophages induce mechanical stress in fibroblasts on soft matrix that alone suppresses their spontaneous activation.

However, many challenges remain, such as the complicated engineering process and dependence on ligand-receptor interaction. Here, we present a simple in vivo platelet-hitchhiking strategy based on self-assembling peptides without ligand modification. The engineered peptide nanofibers can hitchhike ultrafast (<5 s) and efficiently on both resting and activated platelets in a receptor-independent and species-independent manner. Mechanistic studies showed that unique secondary structure of nanofibers, which lead to surface exposure of hydrophobic and hydrogen bond–forming groups, might primarily contribute to the selective and efficient platelet-hitchhiking behavior. After intravenous injection, these peptide nanofibers hitchhiked in situ on circulating platelets and achieved almost 20-fold lung accumulation. Our study provides not only a different paradigm of in vivo platelet-hitchhiking beyond ligand-receptor recognition but also a potential strategy for lung-targeted drug delivery and pulmonary disease therapy."

It is generally believed that continued urbanization will put increasing pressure on ecosystems. However, in recent decades, the degree of population agglomeration and ecological environment have simultaneously increased in China. This paper takes Fenhe River Basin as the study area, measures the spatial Gini coefficient of population distribution (Gini) and ecosystem services in 165 sub-basins from 2000 to 2020, and adopts two-way fixed effects model to study the impacts of population agglomeration on ecosystem services and its mechanism. The results show that population agglomeration is positively correlated with the overall benefit (OB) of ecosystem services, and the effect is moderated by vegetation coverage, slope and distance from market centre, only when the values are greater than 0.198, less than 6.62° and 17.90 km, respectively, will the positive effects become apparent. The phenomenon of ‘people withdrawing and vegetation entering’ makes population agglomeration have significant impacts on individual ecosystem services and trade-offs and synergies. In order to give better play to the positive effect, the population needs to migrate from areas with worse geographical conditions and farther away from market centres to better places, and the return of farmland to forests should be accelerated in areas with population concentration.

We test GDCLD with seven advanced algorithms and show that it is effective in achieving reliable landslide mapping across different triggers and environments, with great potential in enhancing emergency response and disaster management. 
 Rapid and accurate mapping of landslides triggered by extreme events is essential for effective emergency response, hazard mitigation, and disaster management. However, the development of generalized machine learning models for landslide detection has been hindered by the absence of a high-resolution, globally distributed, event-based dataset. To address this gap, we introduce the Globally Distributed Coseismic Landslide Dataset (GDCLD), a comprehensive dataset that integrates multi-source remote sensing images, including PlanetScope, Gaofen-6, Map World, and uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) data, with varying geographical and geological background for nine events across the globe. The GDCLD data are freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13612636 (Fang et al., 2024). In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of GDCLD by comparing the mapping performance of seven state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms. These models were further tested by three different types of remote sensing images in four independent regions, with the GDCLD-SegFormer model achieving the best performance. Additionally, we extended the evaluation to a rainfall-induced landslide dataset, where the models demonstrated excellent performance as well, highlighting the dataset's applicability to landslide segmentation triggered by other factors.

An integration of apical endpoints, i.e., survival, growth, and reproduction, with gonad histopathology and gene transcription (RNA-seq) was performed to provide additional insights into the mode of action (MoA) of NPX. NPX decreased zebrafish growth and reproduction and led to histopathological alterations in gonads at concentrations as low as 0.1 μg/L. At the molecular level, 0.7 μg/L of NPX led to a disruption in gonads transcription of genes involved in several biological processes associated with reproduction, mainly involving steroid hormone biosynthesis and epigenetic/epitranscriptomic machineries.

Here, we utilized biogeochemical and genome-resolved metagenomic profiling, assisted by machine learning analysis, to estimate the contributions of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation and to predict the key environmental factors driving this process in soils from five distinct ecosystems. The results showed that phylogenetically and physiologically diverse H2 and CO oxidizers and chemosynthetic carbon-fixing microbes are present in the soil in different terrestrial ecosystems. The large-scale variations in soil carbon fixation were highly positively correlated with both the abundance and the activity of H2 and CO oxidizers (p < 0.05–0.001). Furthermore, soil pH and moisture-induced shifts in the abundance of H2 and CO oxidizers partially explained the variation in soil carbon fixation (55%). The contributions of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation in the different terrestrial ecosystems were estimated to range from 1.1% to 35.0%. The estimated rate of trace gas carbon fixation varied from 0.04 to 1.56 mg kg–1 d–1.

Following flash initiation through fast positive breakdown at high altitudes above 9 km, the VHF radiation front of upward negative streamers ascended continuously at a speed of ∼1.0 × 106 m/s, forming a continuous initial breakdown burst (CIBB) about 2 km in length.

 Host–pathogen conflicts are crucibles of molecular innovation1,2. Selection for immunity to pathogens has driven the evolution of sophisticated immunity mechanisms throughout biology, including in bacterial defence against bacteriophages3. Here we characterize the widely distributed anti-phage defence system CmdTAC, which provides robust defence against infection by the T-even family of phages4. Our results support a model in which CmdC detects infection by sensing viral capsid proteins, ultimately leading to the activation of a toxic ADP-ribosyltransferase effector protein, CmdT. We show that newly synthesized capsid protein triggers dissociation of the chaperone CmdC from the CmdTAC complex, leading to destabilization and degradation of the antitoxin CmdA, with consequent liberation of the CmdT ADP-ribosyltransferase. Notably, CmdT does not target a protein, DNA or structured RNA, the known targets of other ADP-ribosyltransferases. Instead, CmdT modifies the N6 position of adenine in GA dinucleotides within single-stranded RNAs, leading to arrest of mRNA translation and inhibition of viral replication. Our work reveals a novel mechanism of anti-viral defence and a previously unknown but broadly distributed class of ADP-ribosyltransferases that target mRNA.

 Aerial light detection and ranging (lidar) has emerged as a powerful technology for mapping urban archaeological landscapes, especially where dense vegetation obscures site visibility1,2. More recently, uncrewed aerial vehicle/drone lidar scanning has markedly improved the resolution of three-dimensional point clouds, allowing for the detection of slight traces of structural features at centimetres of detail across large archaeological sites, a method particularly useful in areas such as mountains, where rapid deposition and erosion irregularly bury and expose archaeological remains3. Here we present the results of uncrewed aerial vehicle–lidar surveys in Central Asia, conducted at two recently discovered archaeological sites in southeastern Uzbekistan: Tashbulak and Tugunbulak. Situated at around 2,000–2,200 m above sea level, these sites illustrate a newly documented geography of large, high-altitude urban centres positioned along the mountainous crossroads of Asia’s medieval Silk Routes (6th–11th century CE (Common Era)4,5. Although hidden by centuries of surface processes, our pairing of very-high-resolution surface modelling with semiautomated feature detection produces a detailed plan of monumental fortifications and architecture spanning 120 ha at Tugunbulak, thereby demonstrating one of the largest highland urban constellations in premodern Central Asia. Documentation of extensive urban infrastructure and technological production among medieval communities in Central Asia’s mountains—a crucial nexus for Silk Road trade networks6—provides a new perspective on the participation of highland populations in the economic, political and social formation of medieval Eurasia.

Here, the authors test the impact of 2335 tumor-derived C-terminal nonstop extensions on protein expression and find the majority to be suppressive; they also analyze their biochemical properties and relation to evolutionary selection patterns. 
 Nonstop extension mutations, a.k.a. stop-lost or stop-loss mutations, convert a stop codon into a sense codon resulting in translation into the 3’ untranslated region until the next in-frame stop codon, thereby extending the C-terminus of a protein. In cancer, only nonstop mutations in SMAD4 have been functionally characterized, while the impact of other nonstop mutations remain unknown. Here, we exploit our pan-cancer NonStopDB dataset and test all 2335 C-terminal extensions arising from somatic nonstop mutations in cancer for their impact on protein expression. In a high-throughput screen, 56.1% of the extensions effectively reduce protein abundance. Extensions of multiple tumor suppressor genes like PTEN, APC, B2M, CASP8, CDKN1B and MLH1 are effective and validated for their suppressive impact. Importantly, the effective extensions possess a higher hydrophobicity than the neutral extensions linking C-terminal hydrophobicity with protein destabilization. Analyzing the proteomes of eleven different species reveals conserved patterns of amino acid distribution in the C-terminal regions of all proteins compared to the proteomes like an enrichment of lysine and arginine and a depletion of glycine, leucine, valine and isoleucine across species and kingdoms. These evolutionary selection patterns are disrupted in the cancer-derived effective nonstop extensions. Nonstop extension mutations in cancer remain poorly characterized.

 Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is crucial in oncogene amplification, gene transcription regulation, and intratumor heterogeneity.

 H2A.Z-nucleosomes are present in both euchromatin and heterochromatin and it has proven difficult to interpret their disparate roles in the context of their stability features. Using an in situ assay of nucleosome stability and DT40 cells expressing engineered forms of the histone variant we show that native H2A.Z, but not C-terminally truncated H2A.Z (H2A.Z∆C), is released from nucleosomes of peripheral heterochromatin at unusually high salt concentrations. H2A.Z and H3K9me3 landscapes are reorganized in H2A.Z∆C-nuclei and overall sensitivity of chromatin to nucleases is increased. These tail-dependent differences are recapitulated upon treatment of HeLa nuclei with the H2A.Z-tail-peptide (C9), with MNase sensitivity being increased genome-wide. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy revealed C9 binding to reconstituted nucleosomes. When introduced into live cells, C9 elicited chromatin reorganization, overall nucleosome destabilization and changes in gene expression. Thus, H2A.Z-nucleosomes influence global chromatin architecture in a tail-dependent manner, what can be modulated by introducing the tail-peptide into live cells.

Here, the authors examine the physiological effects of overexpressing NEK4 in the hippocampus of mice, showing that it leads to aberrations in circadian traits. 
 GWASs have linked the 3p21.1 locus, which is associated with the expression levels of NEK4, to bipolar disorder. Here, we use integrative analyses of GWAS statistics and eQTL annotations to establish that elevated NEK4 expression in the hippocampus is associated with an increased risk of bipolar disorder. To further study this association, we generate transgenic male mice that conditionally overexpress NEK4 in the pyramidal neurons of the adult forebrain, or use AAV to overexpress NEK4 in the dorsal hippocampus. Compared to the control mice, male mice of both strains exhibit a shift from a diurnal anxiety state to a nocturnal normal or anxiolytic-like state. Overexpression of NEK4 also affects the circadian fluctuations in dendritic spine morphology and synaptic structure. Furthermore, we show that treatment with lithium ameliorates the effects of NEK4 overexpression in male mice. We then perform phosphoproteomic analyses to demonstrate that the diurnal and nocturnal phosphoproteomic profiles of male control and NEK4 overexpressing mice are different. These results suggest that male mice with different NEK4 expression levels may recapitulate some of the core features observed in patients with bipolar disorder, indicating that interruption of the homeostatic dynamics of synapses may underlie the emotional swings in bipolar disorder.

 The dependence of L-band Vegetation Optical Depth (L-VOD, τ) on Vegetation temperature TV is investigated for 1165 boreal forest grid cells selected for latitudes > 55° and high radiometric forest fraction FFO≥90%. SMOS Level-3 Brightness Temperatures (BT) at ascending orbits acquired from 2011 to 2022 are used. This is a spatio-temporal extension of our previous study on τTV made over the “Sodankylä grid cell” (Finland) in 2019. It demonstrated the Electromagnetic (EM) reasons for τTV reaching maximum at 0°C and decreasing when TV is moving away from 0°C. The parameterisation of the ""L-VOD model"" developed in the previous study is simplified and updated to take into account the conservation of salt in sap-water during freezing. The “forward operator” based on the Two-Stream Microwave Emission Model (2S-MEM) is inverted to retrieve τSMOSTV together with effective Ground permittivities εG during seasonal Warming Periods (WPs) determined from ERA-interim air temperatures. The “L-VOD model” parameters TmeltWCwood are estimated for the boreal forest grid cells by minimizing squared differences between τSMOSTV and simulated τsimTV. The vegetation melt-parameter Tmelt represents the “number of degrees below 0°C” at which sap-water melts, and WCwood is the gravimetric wood-Water Content of branches. Reasonable values of TmeltWCwood are achieved for a majority of the boreal forest grid cells. It is found that Tmelt tends to be too high over Northern Europe, a region with longer WP durations compared to other regions of the boreal forest belt. By optimising the scattering albedo used to retrieve τSMOSTV, the correlations between τsimTV and τSMOSTV can be increased, thereby improving the reliability of TmeltWCwood. The results raise the possibility of an alternative method to parameterise the scattering albedo of boreal forests by means of the reality-based nature of τSMOSTV associated with the consistency of Tmelt with expected values. The study also shows that estimating the Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) of boreal forests using L-VOD must take into account the reduction in L-VOD due to the EM-reasons resulting from freezing sap-water in wooden branches, which dominate the radiative transfer at L-band."

 Confronting the escalating challenge of emergencies, the urban supply network of daily necessity is an important defense line for human well-being. This study introduces a groundbreaking approach that leverages mobile signaling data, departing from static regional data, to model large-scale and high-precision urban supply-demand network. Moreover, a significant stride in assessing network invulnerability is presented by incorporating cascading failure and emphasizing demand-side factors in attack strategy simulations.

The model’s robustness is corroborated through simulations of major disaster scenarios. The results indicate that: 1) High-precision human mobility data promises large-scale urban supply-demand network modeling with high accuracy. 2) In regions characterized by greater vulnerability, the establishment of local supply networks demonstrates efficacy in mitigating the impacts of minor disasters. 3) During various stages of cascading failure, the leading factors contributing to community supply shortages vary, with population density being the predominant factor.

The methodological steps consist of 1) simulating images with a 3D radiative transfer model, 2) image style transfer learning based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and 3) tree crown segmentation using U-net segmentation model. The delineation performances of the proposed method have been evaluated on a manually annotated dataset consisting of more than 40,000 tree crowns. Our approach, which relies solely on synthetic images, demonstrates high segmentation accuracy, with an F1 score exceeding 0.77 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) above 0.64. Particularly, it achieves impressive accuracy in extracting crown areas (r2 greater than 0.87) and crown densities (r2 greater than 0.72), comparable to that of a trained dataset with human annotations only. In this study, we demonstrated that the integration of a 3D radiative transfer model and GANs for automatically generating training labels can achieve performances comparable to human labeling, and can significantly reduce the time needed for manual labeling in remote sensing segmentation applications."

 The perception of safety significantly impacts residents’ urban living and socio-economic development. However, the phenomenon and drivers of gender differences in safety perceptions have not received sufficient emphasis, resulting in the gradual exacerbation of gender inequality in urban environments. To address this issue, we explored a research methodology that integrates visual perception with socio-environmental characteristics to more comprehensively explain gender differences in safety perceptions. We conducted an empirical investigation in the primary urban area of Nanjing, China. We explored the spatial distribution characteristics of safety perception differences using the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model and spatial autocorrelation analysis. Additionally, we examined the impact of visual elements on gender differences through ridge regression analysis. Given the unsteady spatial distribution of urban environmental data and safety perceptions, we employed multi-scale geographically weighted regression models to account for differential distributions. These models captured the spatial relationships between indicators of socio-economic characteristics, urban environmental characteristics, social media vitality, and safety perceptions. Some interesting findings were identified in the study: (1) Gender differences were concentrated in high-density old urban areas and expansive agricultural land. (2) Women have more negative perceptions of the color richness of streets and the enclosure of interfaces. (3) Characteristics of local people’s activities positively influenced perceptions of safety, whereas characteristics representing diverse people’s activities more negatively characterized perceptions of safety for men. This study contributes a comprehensive and replicable methodology to the research on gender differences in urban perceptions, offering insights for urban planning decisions and promoting gender inclusivity."

 Accurate bathymetric data is crucial for various aspects such as marine resource exploitation and marine ecological conservation. Currently, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) based on empirical and physical models has been widely utilized in constructing underwater terrain in shallow seas. However, the application of such SDB models is limited in remote island reef areas lacking in-situ measurement data. To overcome this issue, the manuscript proposes an unconstrained SDB optimization method without in-situ measurement data, utilizing satellite multispectral imagery (Geoeye-1) and spaceborne LiDAR data (ICESat-2). By classifying the seafloor substrate in coral reef areas into sandy and coral, based on the depth invariant index (DII), we employ an adaptive logarithmic ratio model for unconstrained SDB. The ICESat-2 LiDAR data are then used to correct the SDB results, achieving bathymetry optimization in the coral reef area of the Xisha Islands. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to Yuanzhi Island of the Xisha Islands, and the accuracy of the bathymetric results is evaluated against ALB (Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry) data. The findings demonstrate that compared to conventional methods, our method can improve the accuracy of SDB results with good adaptability. In the Yuanzhi Island area, the proposed method yields SDB results with an R2 of 0.93, an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 0.94, and an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 1.12 m, compared to ALB data. The average error is less than 10 % of the maximum depth, essentially meeting the requirements of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) standards for depth measurement error when depth is <20 m. This study can offer a novel approach for enhancing bathymetric accuracy around offshore and remote islands, where gathering underwater terrain data is challenging."

Using genome, transcriptome, and proteome analysis ofHypsibius henanensissp. nov., we explored the molecular basis contributing to radiotolerance in this organism. A putatively horizontally transferred gene, DOPA dioxygenase 1 (DODA1), responds to radiation and confers radiotolerance by synthesizing betalains—a type of plant pigment with free radical–scavenging properties. A tardigrade-specific radiation-induced disordered protein, TRID1, facilitates DNA damage repair through a mechanism involving phase separation. Two mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly proteins, BCS1 and NDUFB8, accumulate to accelerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regeneration for poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and subsequent poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)–mediated DNA damage repair.

InDrosophila melanogaster, 57% of chemicals affected larval behavior, and a higher proportion compromised long-term survivability. Exposure to sublethal doses also induced widespread changes in the phosphoproteome and changes in development and reproduction.

In order to evaluate possible adaptation strategies to avoid or postpone reaching the economic limit, we developed the microeconomic heuristic model HELGA (hydro-economic limits as a global analysis). HELGA considers the interaction of groundwater with irrigation at the farm level with a global scale application in mind. HELGA evaluates the development of the costs and revenue of groundwater-fed irrigated agriculture from the farmer’s perspective. As long as the farm remains economically viable, the farmer can invest to access deeper groundwater, but in the long run the famer may have to adapt to keep farming profitable. We applied HELGA in five locations within the conterminous USA. In most cases, recharge is large enough to save a farmer from reaching the economic limit. Where groundwater is overexploited, the increasing energy cost of groundwater pumping is one of the main drivers limiting groundwater use. Additionally, the increasing costs of the water infrastructure (i.e. deeper wells) is a crucial factor that explains where and when the economic limit is reached. If farmers change crops wisely or fallow part of their land, they are able to access groundwater longer and postpone the moment the economic limit is reached. Using HELGA, we show that proper and timely adaptation measures increases the profitable lifetime of groundwater and helps to conserve this resource for future generations."

The results show major centennial-scale moisture anomalies at this site, with drier and wetter conditions during the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, respectively, which resemble the pattern of moisture changes in ‘westerlies Asia’. During the period of rapid anthropogenic warming, the site is much drier, with isotopic evidence for threshold-like summer desiccation of peat-forming Sphagnum mosses.

In particular, fisheries conflicts arise when a marine resource is contested or disputed between a minimum of two actors. Despite the potentially large impacts of fisheries conflicts on marine-based economies, it is difficult to quantify the impact of conflict on fisheries production or on long-standing cooperative relationships that can be vital to the long-term sustainability of a given fishery. Previous work addressing fisheries conflicts has had a limited focus on quantitative measurements of how changes in fishing effort can influence how communities fall into conflict or make concerted efforts to cooperate. To address this knowledge gap, instances of conflict and cooperation amongst fishers in Puerto Rico were documented and categorized into different intensity levels. A linear probability model was then developed to estimate the probability of a conflict event occurring in a specific region, month, and year from 2012 to 2017. The model includes catch per unit effort as a predictor variable and controls for environmental factors. We found that an increase in catch per trip from the previous month has a negative and significant relationship with the probability of a conflict event. This result provides quantitative evidence for the supply-induced scarcity hypothesis, highlighting the importance of managing fisheries sustainably, to avoid future fisheries conflicts."

This study accessed various setups of WRF-GHG simulations that ensure consistency between the model and driving reanalysis fields. We found that a combination of nudging and frequent re-initialization allows certain improvement by constraining the soil moisture fields and, through its impact on atmospheric mixing, improves atmospheric transport. 
 Atmospheric transport models are often used to simulate the distribution of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This can be in the context of forward modeling of tracer transport using surface–atmosphere fluxes or flux estimation through inverse modeling, whereby atmospheric tracer measurements are used in combination with simulated transport. In both of these contexts, transport errors can bias the results and should therefore be minimized.Here, we analyze transport uncertainties in the commonly used Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the greenhouse gas module (WRF-GHG), enabling passive tracer transport simulation of CO2 and CH4. As a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model, WRF's transport is constrained by global meteorological fields via initialization and at the lateral boundaries of the domain of interest. These global fields were generated by assimilating various meteorological data to increase the accuracy of modeled fields. However, in limited-domain models like WRF, the winds in the center of the domain can deviate considerably from these driving fields. As the accuracy of the wind speed and direction is critical to the prediction of tracer transport, maintaining a close link to the observations across the simulation domain is desired. On the other hand, a link that is too close to the global meteorological fields can degrade performance at smaller spatial scales that are better represented by the mesoscale model. In this work, we evaluated the performance of strategies for keeping WRF's meteorology compatible with meteorological observations. To avoid the complexity of assimilating meteorological observations directly, two main strategies of coupling WRF-GHG with ERA5 meteorological reanalysis data were tested over a 2-month-long simulation over the European domain: (a) restarting the model daily with fresh initial conditions (ICs) from ERA5 and (b) nudging the atmospheric winds, temperatures, and moisture to those of ERA5 continuously throughout the simulation period, using WRF's built-in four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) in grid-nudging mode.Meteorological variables and simulated mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 were compared against observations to assess the performance of the different strategies. We also compared planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) with radiosonde-derived estimates. Either nudging or daily restarts similarly improved the meteorology and GHG transport in our simulations, with a small advantage of using both methods in combination. However, notable differences in soil moisture were found that accumulated over the course of the simulation when not using frequent restarts. The soil moisture drift had an impact on the simulated PBLH, presumably via changing the Bowen ratio. This is partially mitigated through nudging without requiring daily restarts, although not entirely alleviated. Soil moisture drift did not have a noticeable impact on GHG performance in our case, likely because it was dominated by other errors. However, since the PBLH is critical for accurately simulating GHG transport, we recommend transport model setups that tie soil moisture to observations. Our method of frequently re-initializing simulations with meteorological reanalysis fields proved suitable for this purpose."

This evaluation reveals the impact of these parameters on mixed-layer depth, sea surface temperature and salinity, and ocean stratification. Our findings demonstrate significant impacts on sea ice thickness and sea ice concentration, emphasizing the need for accurately representing ocean mixing to understand Arctic climate dynamics. 
 We evaluate the vertical turbulent-kinetic-energy (TKE) mixing scheme of the NEMO-SI3 ocean–sea-ice model in sea-ice-covered regions of the Arctic Ocean. Specifically, we assess the parameters involved in TKE mixed-layer-penetration (MLP) parameterization. This ad hoc parameterization aims to capture processes that impact the ocean surface boundary layer, such as near-inertial oscillations, ocean swells, and waves, which are often not well represented in the default TKE scheme. We evaluate this parameterization for the first time in three regions of the Arctic Ocean: the Makarov, Eurasian, and Canada basins.We demonstrate the strong effect of the scaling parameter that accounts for the presence of sea ice. Our results confirm that TKE MLP must be scaled down below sea ice to avoid unrealistically deep mixed layers. The other parameters evaluated are the percentage of energy penetrating below the mixed layer and the length scale of its decay with depth. All these parameters affect mixed-layer depth and its seasonal cycle, surface temperature, and salinity, as well as underlying stratification. Shallow mixed layers are associated with stronger stratification and fresh surface anomalies, and deeper mixed layers correspond to weaker stratification and salty surface anomalies.Notably, we observe significant impacts on sea-ice thickness across the Arctic Ocean in two scenarios: when the scaling parameter due to sea ice is absent and when the TKE mixed-layer-penetration process vanishes. In the former case, we observe an increase of several meters in mixed-layer depth, along with a reduction in sea-ice thickness ranging from 30 to 40 cm, reflecting the impact of stronger mixing. Conversely, in the latter case, we notice that a shallower mixed layer is accompanied by a moderate increase in sea-ice thickness, ranging from 10 to 20 cm, as expected from weaker mixing. Additionally, interannual variability suggests that experiments incorporating a scaling parameter based on sea-ice concentration display an increased mixed-layer depth during periods of reduced sea ice, which is consistent with observed trends. These findings underscore the influence of enhanced ocean mixing, through specific parameterizations, on the physical properties of the upper ocean and sea ice."

Because of the complexity of these systems, we must be careful when intervening in them; otherwise we may cause irreversible damage. Using computer models, we can gain insight about these complex systems without harming them. In this paper we describe how we connected an ecological model of forest insect infestation with a social model of cooperation and simulated an intervention measure to save a forest from infestation. 
 Engaging ecological resource users in intervention to protect resources is challenging for governments due to the self-interest of users and uncertainty about intervention consequences. Focusing on a case of forest insect infestations, we addressed questions of resource protection and environmentally responsible behavior promotion with a conceptual model. We coupled a forest infestation model with a social model in which a governing agent applies a mechanism for the recognition and promotion of environmentally responsible behavior among several user agents. We ran the coupled model in various scenarios with a reinforcement-learning algorithm for the governing agent as well as best-case, worst-case, and random baselines. Results showed that a proper recognition policy facilitates emergence of environmentally responsible behavior. However, ecosystem health may deteriorate due to temporal differences between the social and ecological systems. Our work shows it is possible to gain insight about complexities of social–ecological systems with conceptual models through scenario analysis."

However, existing methods for detecting MPO in cells are limited. In this study, a DNAzyme nanorobot was developed using a scaffold of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated with functional DNAzyme strands and their fluorophore-labeled substrate strands. The DNAzyme remains inactive due to a self-assembled hairpin structure, with a phosphorothioate (PT) modification inserted into the stem domain. When MPO is present, it triggers a halogenation process that generates hypochlorous acid (HClO). HClO specifically catalyzes the cleavage of the PT-site, releasing free DNAzyme strands to cleave their substrates and generating an increasing fluorescent signal. The detection limit for MPO and its primary product, HClO, were determined to be 0.038 μg/mL and 0.013 μM, respectively. The DNAzyme nanorobot can be readily introduced into cells and function autonomously to differentiate increased MPO/HClO levels caused by antibiotics.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends using emission factors (EFs) to estimate indirect N2O emission, but the EF for ditches (EF5g) is categorized as groundwater, which potentially introduces a significant bias. This study conducted a regional-scale campaign in the North China Plain, one of the world’s most intensive agricultural regions, and calculated the EF5g values from agricultural ditches by the concentration method (N2O–N/NO3––N). The results found that the regional-scale mean EF5g value (0.0028) was less than half of the IPCC default value (0.006), illustrating that the current IPCC methodology significantly overestimates N2O emissions from agricultural ditches. Despite the relatively small EF5g values, agricultural ditches exhibited a high mean N2O concentration (3.36 μg L–1) and a large regional emission (1.14 ± 0.86 Gg N2O–N yr–1), which is equal to 3.8 ± 2.9% of direct N2O emission from the croplands in the North China Plain. Since ditches are ubiquitous in agricultural regions and are likely to expand under climate change, refining EF5g is crucial to accurately assess their contribution to global N2O budgets."

Here, we demonstrated a mechanism for enhancing salt tolerance in rice under salt stress via priming with nonstimulatory nanoparticles such as selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), distinct from stimulatory nanomaterials. Due to the dynamic transformation ability of SeNPs, SeNP priming could enhance rice salt tolerance by mediating the glutathione cycle to eliminate excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). During priming, SeNPs penetrated rice seeds and transitioned into a soluble form (99.9%) within the embryo endosperm. Subsequently, the soluble selenium (Se) was transported to rice roots and metabolized into various Se-related derivatives, including selenomethionine (SeMet), Na2SeO3 (Se IV), selenocysteine (SeCys2), and methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys). These derivatives significantly enhanced the root activities of key enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 24.97%, 47.98%, 16.23%, 16.81%, and 14.82%, respectively, thus reinforcing the glutathione cycle and ROS scavenging pathways.

The anomalies are spatially concentrated near weakly stratified areas and regions with strong lateral buoyancy gradients diagnosed from satellite altimetry, particularly in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current's standing meanders. We use bio‐optical ratios, specifically the chlorophyll a to particulate backscatter ratio (Chl/bbp) to find that eddy subduction is most active in the spring and early summer, with freshly exported material associated with seasonally weak vertical stratification and increasing surface biomass.

Using the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the ML results, we observe that plate age and subduction dip are the most influential variables. The results suggest that older, shallow‐dipping plates contribute to low b‐values, indicating higher megathrust stress. This pattern is attributed to the higher rigidity of older plates, increasing flexural strength, and generating a shallow penetration angle, increasing the frictional interplate area and intensifying the megathrust stress. These findings offer new insights into the non‐linear complexity of seismic behavior at global scale."

 The ocean annually absorbs about a quarter of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Global estimates of air–sea CO2 fluxes are typically based on bulk measurements of CO2 in air and seawater and neglect the effects of vertical temperature gradients near the ocean surface. Theoretical and laboratory observations indicate that these gradients alter air–sea CO2 fluxes, because the air–sea CO2 concentration difference is highly temperature sensitive. However, in situ field evidence supporting their effect is so far lacking. Here we present independent direct air–sea CO2 fluxes alongside indirect bulk fluxes collected along repeat transects in the Atlantic Ocean (50° N to 50° S) in 2018 and 2019. We find that accounting for vertical temperature gradients reduces the difference between direct and indirect fluxes from 0.19 mmol m−2 d−1 to 0.08 mmol m−2 d−1 (N = 148). This implies an increase in the Atlantic CO2 sink of ~0.03 PgC yr−1 (~7% of the Atlantic Ocean sink). These field results validate theoretical, modelling and observational-based efforts, all of which predicted that accounting for near-surface temperature gradients would increase estimates of global ocean CO2 uptake. Accounting for this increased ocean uptake will probably require some revision to how global carbon budgets are quantified. Accounting for near-surface temperature gradients leads to estimates for annual CO2 uptake in the North Atlantic that are 7% higher, based on a comparison of eddy covariance and bulk CO2 measurements, which is consistent with theory, laboratory assessments and model analysis."

 Impaired secretion of an essential blood coagulation factor fibrinogen leads to hepatic fibrinogen storage disease (HFSD), characterized by the presence of fibrinogen-positive inclusion bodies and hypofibrinogenemia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of fibrinogen in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain unexplored. Here we uncover a key role of SEL1L-HRD1 complex of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) in the formation of aberrant inclusion bodies, and the biogenesis of nascent fibrinogen protein complex in hepatocytes. Acute or chronic deficiency of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in the hepatocytes leads to the formation of hepatocellular inclusion bodies. Proteomics studies followed by biochemical assays reveal fibrinogen as a major component of the inclusion bodies. Mechanistically, we show that the degradation of misfolded endogenous fibrinogen Aα, Bβ, and γ chains by SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD is indispensable for the formation of a functional fibrinogen complex in the ER. Providing clinical relevance of these findings, SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD indeed degrades and thereby attenuates the pathogenicity of two disease-causing fibrinogen γ mutants.

They show that macaque-derived host receptor homolog has multiple structural defects against virus binding. 
 Macaque restricts hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection because its receptor homologue, NTCP (mNTCP), cannot bind preS1 on viral surface. To reveal how mNTCP loses the viral receptor function, we here solve the cryo-electron microscopy structure of mNTCP. Superposing on the human NTCP (hNTCP)-preS1 complex structure shows that Arg158 of mNTCP causes steric clash to prevent preS1 from embedding onto the bile acid tunnel of NTCP. Cell-based mutation analysis confirms that only Gly158 permitted preS1 binding, in contrast to robust bile acid transport among mutations. As the second determinant, Asn86 on the extracellular surface of mNTCP shows less capacity to restrain preS1 from dynamic fluctuation than Lys86 of hNTCP, resulting in unstable preS1 binding. Additionally, presence of long-chain conjugated-bile acids in the tunnel induces steric hindrance with preS1 through their tailed-chain. This study presents structural basis in which multiple sites in mNTCP constitute a molecular barrier to strictly restrict HBV.

Here, we report that Sugar Transporter Protein 28 (OsSTP28) as a key regulator of N-responsive tillering and yield formation in rice.

Thereby, OsSTP28-OSH15-GA2oxs module reduces the level of bioactive gibberellin in shoot base upon increased N supply, and consequently promotes tillering and grain yield. Moreover, we identify an elite allele of OsSTP28 that can effectively promote N-responsive tillering and yield formation, thus representing a valuable breeding target of N use efficiency improvement for agricultural sustainability.

 Candida auris is an emerging nosocomial fungal pathogen associated with life-threatening invasive disease due to its persistent colonization, high level of transmissibility and multi-drug resistance. Aggregative and non-aggregative growth phenotypes for C. auris strains with different biofilm forming abilities, drug susceptibilities and virulence characteristics have been described. Using comprehensive transcriptional analysis we identified key cell surface adhesins that were highly upregulated in the aggregative phenotype during in vitro and in vivo grown biofilms using a mouse model of catheter infection. Phenotypic and functional evaluations of generated null mutants demonstrated crucial roles for the adhesins Als4112 and Scf1 in mediating cell-cell adherence, coaggregation and biofilm formation. While individual mutants were largely non-aggregative, in combination cells were able to co-adhere and aggregate, as directly demonstrated by measuring cell adhesion forces using single-cell atomic force spectroscopy. This co-adherence indicates their role as complementary adhesins, which despite their limited similarity, may function redundantly to promote cell-cell interaction and biofilm formation. Functional diversity of cell wall proteins may be a form of regulation that provides the aggregative phenotype of C. auris with flexibility and rapid adaptation to the environment, potentially impacting persistence and virulence. Here, Wang et al show that Candida auris cell wall adhesins function redundantly to promote cell-cell interaction and biofilm formation as a form of regulation and potential adaption to the environment."

 Temperature variability has substantial socioeconomic impacts through its association with the frequency and severity of heat extremes. Under anthropogenic influence, climate models project seasonally-dependent amplifications of near-surface temperature variability over some sectors of the Southern Hemisphere, and robust positive trends have already been observed in recent decades. Here we show that the amplification of subweekly temperature variability simulated by the multi-model ensemble mean of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) over South Africa, Australia, and South America is often substantially smaller than in reanalyses in recent decades, reaching a similar amplification only at the end of the 21st century due to a weaker amplification of subweekly variance generation efficiency.

 Magmatic volatile phases play a major role in igneous systems, but indirect sampling of the magmatic fluid, especially for basic magmas, remains challenging to document. Here, we report compelling evidence of primary fluid inclusions trapped within magmatic ilmenite from two different basic intrusive settings: Armorican Massif (France) and Central Iberian Zone (Spain). Fluid inclusions have a solute chemistry dominated by sodium, calcium, chlorine, sulfur and iron, with detectable contents of metals and metalloids and thus likely record the onset of late-stage magmatic volatile saturation in these basic magmas. Hence, we argue the presence of fluid inclusions in ilmenite may be a good indicator for magma degassing in these settings and importantly records the magmatic-hydrothermal transition. Additionally, this study suggests that the trapping of the magmatic volatile phase during ilmenite (and other opaque minerals) crystallization may be more common but at present an underappreciated phenomenon in basic igneous magmatic systems.

 Northern regions are warming faster than the rest of the globe. It is difficult to predict ecosystem responses to warming because the thermal sensitivity of their biophysical components varies. Here, we present an analysis of the authors’ expert judgment regarding the sensitivity of six ecosystem components – permafrost, peatlands, lakes, snowpack, vegetation, and endothermic vertebrates – across northern landscapes ranging from boreal to polar biomes. We identified 28 discontinuous component states across a 3700 km latitudinal gradient in northeastern North America and quantified sensitivity as the transition time from an initial to a contrasting state following a theoretical step change increase in mean annual air temperature of 5 °C. We infer that multiple interconnected state shifts are likely to occur within a narrow subarctic latitudinal band at timescales of 10 to more than 100 years, and response times decrease with latitude. Response times differ between components and across latitudes, which is likely to impair the integrity of ecosystems.

Disturbances on sub-pixel level. •minimum detectable forest disturbance area is around 40 m2. 
 Forests provide important ecosystem functions such as carbon sequestration and climate regulation, particularly in countries with high forest cover. Climate change-induced extreme weather events have a negative impact on many forest ecosystems. In Germany, for instance, the drought of the years 2018 until 2020 resulted in signs of damage in almost 80% of trees. This decline in forest vitality has additionally led to severe bark beetle infestations and widespread tree mortality, posing significant challenges to forest managers to obtain a complete picture of the state of their forests. Since a completely ground-based monitoring of forest condition is not feasible due to the forests' vast extent, remote sensing and particularly multispectral satellite image time series (SITS) analysis were suggested as efficient alternatives. Transformers, a state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) architecture, have shown promising results in the classification of multivariate SITS for other applications. Here, we use Transformers in combination with Sentinel-2 (S2) time series data to test if they can improve forest disturbance detection capabilities in comparison to conventional methods by automatically extracting relevant information from background variability throughout the whole time series. To match the large training data needs of Transformers, we use a two-step approach including pre-training and finetuning. During pre-training, we use outputs of earlier presented SITS approaches, while during finetuning, we use detailed reference data of known disturbances covering between 10 and 100% of a Sentinel-2 pixel as extracted from aerial images. We test three setups: DL base using ten S2 bands, DL IND using ten vegetation indices (VIs), and DL +IND utilising both as model input. F1-scores across all of our six study sites range between approx. 0.65 (DL +IND) and 0.72 (DL base) in a binary classification (undisturbed vs. disturbed) when considering both full and partial disturbances. DL base outperforms the other setups in forest disturbance detection, and detects disturbance extents as small as 40 m2 within pixels of 100 m2 size. Given the best performance of DL base, handcrafted vegetation indices (VIs) do not improve the model. Our model is competitive with existing approaches and slightly outperforms most earlier reported results, even though a direct comparison is challenging. Considering the option to further refine our trained model if additional reference data becomes available over time, we conclude that a combination of Transformers and Sentinel-2 time series can be developed into an effective tool for forest disturbance monitoring of Central European forests at fine spatial grain."

 Recently the applications of remotely sensed Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) in the study of photosynthesis, stress conditions, and gross primary production have increased significantly. The full SIF spectrum spans over a spectral region of 650 ∼ 850 nm with two characteristic peaks around 685 nm and 740 nm. Over recent decades, many retrieval algorithms have been developed to estimate SIF at Top-Of-Canopy (TOC) using in-situ measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. Although the majority of retrieval methods retrieve SIF at a narrow spectral window, there exists a potential for retrieval of SIF in the full emission spectrum. Moreover, solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra should ideally be measured at the same time but are usually measured sequentially with a certain time lag, raising potential errors in SIF retrieval. In this study, an enhanced retrieval algorithm of the full SIF spectrum at TOC is proposed. The proposed algorithm attempts to minimize the errors owing to time mismatch in measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. As an improvement to the previous algorithm (advanced Fluorescence Spectrum Reconstruction, aFSR), this proposed algorithm (aFSR-SVE) models the SIF-free contribution with principal components using the singular value decomposition technique. The optimal parameter settings in the forward model were determined for the experimental data collected by spectrometers used in the study. Firstly, the proposed algorithm was used to reconstruct full SIF spectrum for simulated data. The results were compared with known reference SIF values. After achieving satisfying results from simulated data, the proposed algorithm was compared with retrievals from established algorithms using experimental data. The results show improved SIF retrieval accuracy, without the need to simultaneously measure solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. The retrieval values comply with the results of previous algorithms in terms of spectral shape, diurnal trend, and temporal variations. The induced errors in SIF retrievals due to non-simultaneous measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra were also investigated and the proposed algorithm was found to be less prone to such errors. Hence, the proposed algorithm is an improvement in reconstructing the full SIF spectrum with near-ground measurements. With the help of the proposed algorithm, field measurements using sequential systems and automated measurements of multiple targets can be performed effectively as it relaxes the requirement of concurrent measurement of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. For future work, the applicability of this method can be investigated under more variable illumination conditions, like high cirrus clouds, passing clouds or persistent thin clouds."

Here, we introduce the use of microfabricated electrodes based on the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), which substantially increases cell viability and transfection efficiency. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the enhanced delivery of Cas9 protein, guide RNA, and plasmid DNA into cell lines and primary cells. This use of PEDOT:PSS enables rapid modification of difficult-to-transfect cell types to accelerate their study and use as therapeutic platforms."

In freshwater ecosystems, numerous fish species migrate between mainstream rivers or lakes and their tributaries, providing resources and nutrients during their spawning migrations. Multiple migratory species travel to the same destinations and contribute such nutrients, but knowledge remains limited about how the diversity of migratory animals influences the recipient ecosystem. We investigated how migrations of diverse fish community from Lake Biwa, Japan contribute to nutrient inputs in one of the lake’s tributary rivers and how they influence the ecosystem. Sequential migration of six fish species continued for 8 months of a year, causing high-level nutrient concentration and primary production. The fish-derived resources were taken up by diverse members of the river community.

The strong intersubband transition of these nanoplatelets situated in the near-infrared allows us to coherently drive it with femtosecond near-infrared pulses, and meanwhile, their strong interband transition in the visible records the resultant spectral changes. The splitting is most prominent with cross-polarized, linear pump-probe pulses, consistent with the orthogonal polarizations of interband and intersubband transition dipoles.

Previous studies using mediated electrochemical analyses to determine the reduction potential (EH) values of smectites observed that the relationship between the structural Fe2+(s)/FeTotal ratio in the smectite and EH varied based on the redox history of the smectite. We hypothesize that this behavior, referred to as redox hysteresis, results from the smectite particles not equilibrating with the applied EH over the course of the experiment (∼30 min). To test this hypothesis, we developed a model incorporating interfacial electron transfer kinetics and charge redistribution within the particle to simulate the mediated electrochemical experiments from previous studies. The simulated redox curves accurately matched the previously reported experimental redox curves of the smectite SWa-1, demonstrating that longer equilibration periods led to a decrease in redox hysteresis. We validated this experimentally by measuring the redox curve of SWa-1 after an equilibration period of at least 12 h. Furthermore, we extended the simulations to three other smectites (NAu-1, NAu-2, and SWy-2) and extracted their respective thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. This work offers a framework for interpreting and modeling redox reactions on clay surfaces, along with key parameters for four commonly studied smectites."

Relying on the inferred locking degree and spring water temperature along the fault, we construct a model to connect the fault hydraulic conductivity with the cooling process of upwelling water. Model results suggest that high spring water temperature correlates with high hydraulic conductivity. Further, we use an experimental law to infer that the obtained high hydraulic conductivity may associate with high pore fluid pressure, which in turn weakens the fault frictional strength and leads to weak locking."

Conversely, significant vertical supplies of NO3− through upwelling and diffusion processes markedly reduce the supply ratio in the subarctic region. These dynamics combined lead to high Fe:N supply ratio in the gyre and low ratio in the subarctic, ultimately driving high nitrogen fixation condition in the gyre and the iron‐limited phytoplankton growth condition in the subarctic region."

The assimilation of radar reflectivity requires an accurate and efficient forward operator that links the model state variables to radar observations. In this study, newly developed parameterized forward operators (PFO) for radar reflectivity with a new continuous melting model are implemented to assimilate observed radar data. To assess the impact of the novel parameterized reflectivity forward operators on convective storm analysis and forecasting, two distinct sets of cycled assimilation and forecast experiments are conducted. One set of experiments (ExpRFO) uses a conventional Rayleigh‐scattering‐approximation‐based forward operator (RFO) with hydrometeor classification, while the other uses the PFO (ExpPFO_New) for radar reflectivity with a new continuous melting model. Eight high‐impact severe convective weather events from the Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) 2019 Spring Experiments are selected for this study. The analysis and forecast results are first examined in detail for a classic tornadic supercell case on 24 May 2019, with the potential benefits provided by the PFO then evaluated for all eight cases. It is demonstrated that ExpPFO_New provides more robust results in terms of improving the short‐term severe weather forecasts. Compared to ExpRFO, ExpPFO_New better reproduces all observed supercells in the analysis field, yields a more continuous and reasonable reflectivity distribution near the melting layer, and improves the strength of the cold pool compared to observations. Overall, ExpPFO_New, initialized from the more accurate analysis fields, produces better forecasts of reflectivity and hourly precipitation with smaller biases, especially at heavy precipitation thresholds."

As exceeding the 1.5°C level of global warming is likely to happen in the near future, understanding the response of the ocean‐climate system to temporarily overshooting this warming level is of critical importance. Here, we apply the Adaptive Emissions Reduction Approach to the Earth System Model GFDL‐ESM2M to conduct novel overshoot scenarios that reach 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0°C of global warming before returning to 1.5°C over the time period of 1861–2500. We also perform a complementary scenario that stabilizes global temperature at 1.5°C, allowing to isolate impacts caused by the temperature overshoots alone, both during their peaks and after their reversals. The simulations indicate that substantial residual ocean surface warming persists in the high latitudes after the overshoots, with most notable regional anomalies occurring in the North Atlantic (up to +3.1°C in the 3°C overshoot scenario compared to the 1.5°C stabilization scenario) and the Southern Ocean (+1.2°C). The residual warming is primarily driven by the recoveries of the Atlantic and Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation and associated increases in ocean heat transport. Excess subsurface heat storage in low and mid‐latitudes prevents steric sea level rise (SLR) from reverting to 1.5°C stabilization levels in any overshoot scenario, with steric sea level remaining up to 32% higher in the 3°C overshoot scenario on centennial time scales. Both peak impacts and persistent changes after overshoot reversal bear significant implications for future assessments of coastlines, regional climates, marine ecosystems, and ice sheets."

Preventing the release of these mercury-methylators is crucial to mitigate public health risks associated with MeHg. 
 Methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic systems poses a serious public health risk through bioaccumulation in the aquatic food web. In recent years, MeHg has been observed to increase to concerning levels globally in rivers near cities; however, the causes of this increase are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate the significant role of sewage contamination by analyzing over 1,300 publicly available metagenomes in urban rivers worldwide, and conducting experiments with water samples across China. We find that sewage contamination significantly increases the abundance of mercury (Hg)-methylating microorganisms in urban rivers globally. This increase is primarily attributed to the high abundance of active Hg-methylating microorganisms in sewage, which migrate to rivers via direct discharge or combined sewer overflows (CSOs), becoming key contributors to elevated riverine MeHg levels. Our findings underscore the importance of effectively eliminating Hg-methylating microorganisms from sewage to mitigate the public health risks associated with MeHg in urban rivers. Mercury-methylating microorganisms released from sewage are key contributors to rising methylmercury levels in urban rivers globally. Preventing the release of these mercury-methylators is crucial to mitigate public health risks associated with MeHg."

Here authors show that the hippocampus and its associated neural network utilize a many-to-one weighted mapping principle to rapidly encode and store new memories. 
 Memories are crucial for daily life, yet the network-level organizing principles governing neural representations of experiences remain unknown. Employing dual-site in vivo recording in freely behaving male mice, here we show that hippocampal dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) utilize distinct coding strategies for novel experiences. A small assembly of BLA neurons emerged active during memory acquisition and persisted through consolidation, whereas most dCA1 neurons were engaged in both processes. Machine learning decoding revealed that dCA1 population spikes predicted BLA assembly firing rate, suggesting that most dCA1 neurons concurrently index an episodic event by rapidly establishing weighted communication with a specific BLA assembly – a process we term “many-to-one weighted mapping.” We also found that dCA1 reactivations preceded BLA assembly activity preferably during elongated and enlarged dCA1 ripples. Using a closed-loop strategy, we demonstrated that suppressing BLA activity after large dCA1 ripples impaired memory. These findings highlight a many-to-one weighted mapping mechanism underlying both the acquisition and consolidation of new memories.

The predicted slowdown in wind intensification may therefore accelerate ocean deoxygenation in the coming decades. 
 Ocean deoxygenation is becoming a major stressor for marine ecosystems due to anthropogenic climate change. Two major pathways through which climate change affects ocean oxygen are changes in wind fields and changes in air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes. Here, we use a global ocean biogeochemistry model run under historical atmospheric forcing to show that wind stress is the dominant driver of year-to-year oxygen variability in most ocean regions. Only in areas of water mass formation do air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes dominate year-to-year oxygen dynamics. The deoxygenation since the late 1960s has been driven mainly by changes in air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes. Part of this deoxygenation has been mitigated by wind-driven increases in ventilation and interior oxygen supply, mainly in the Southern Ocean. The predicted slowdown in wind stress intensification, combined with continued ocean warming, may therefore greatly accelerate ocean deoxygenation in the coming decades. The fact that the model used here, along with many state-of-the-art forced ocean models, underestimates recent ocean deoxygenation indicates the need to use forcing fields that better represent pre-industrial conditions during their spin-up.

 Transcriptional control is fundamental to cellular function. However, despite knowing that transcription factors can repress or activate specific genes, how these functions are implemented at the molecular level has remained elusive, particularly in the endogenous context of developing animals. Here, we combine optogenetics, single-cell live-imaging, and mathematical modeling to study how a zinc-finger repressor, Knirps, induces switch-like transitions into long-lived quiescent states. Using optogenetics, we demonstrate that repression is rapidly reversible (~1 min) and memoryless. Furthermore, we show that the repressor acts by decreasing the frequency of transcriptional bursts in a manner consistent with an equilibrium binding model.

 The emergence of commensalism and mutualism often derives from ancestral parasitism. However, in the case of rhizobium-legume interactions, bacterial strains displaying both pathogenic and nodulation features on a single host have not been described yet. Here, we isolated such a bacterium from Medicago nodules. On the same plant genotypes, the T4 strain can induce ineffective nodules in a highly competitive way and behave as a harsh parasite triggering plant death. The T4 strain presents this dual ability on multiple legume species of the Inverted Repeat-Lacking Clade, the output of the interaction relying on the developmental stage of the plant.

 Van der Waals heterostructures provide a versatile platform for tailoring electronic properties through the integration of two-dimensional materials. Among these combinations, the interaction between bilayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) stands out due to its potential for inducing spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene. Future devices concepts require the understanding of the precise nature of SOC in TMD/bilayer graphene heterostructures and its influence on electronic transport phenomena.

Furthermore, we reveal a non-monotonic trend in conductivity with respect to the electric displacement field at charge neutrality. This phenomenon is ascribed to the existence of single-particle gaps induced by the Ising SOC, which can be closed by a critical displacement field. Our findings also unveil sharp peaks in the magnetoconductivity around the critical displacement field, challenging existing theoretical models.

Here the authors show that an ant’s individual immune pathways provide specialized protection against bacterial but not fungal infections, while social immunity protects against pathogenic fungi but not bacteria. 
 Contagious diseases are a major threat to societies in which individuals live in close contact. Social insects have evolved collective defense behaviors, such as social care or isolation of infected workers, that prevent outbreaks of pathogens. It has thus been suggested that individual immunity is reduced in species with such ‘social immunity’. However, this hypothesis has not been tested functionally. Here, we characterize the immune response of the ant Lasius niger using a combination of genomic analysis, experimental infections, gene expression quantification, behavioural observations and pathogen quantifications. We uncover a striking specialization of immune responses towards different pathogens. Systemic individual immunity is effective against opportunistic bacterial infections, which are not covered by social immunity, but is not elicited upon fungal infections, which are effectively controlled by social immunity. This specialization suggests that immune layers have evolved complementary functions predicted to ensure the most cost-effective response against a wide range of pathogens. In social insects, the relative roles of individual immunity and social immunity in fighting pathogens remain unclear.

 Glaciers are thinning and retreating as climate warms, thus eroding less of the Earth’s surface. However, other hydrological factors in glacierized catchments are likely producing a transient increase in sediment delivery, resulting in ‘peak sediment’. Estimating the trajectory of the peak sediment is ecologically and socially important but scientifically challenging because of the delayed and non-linear response of glacier sediment export to climate forcing. This study used time series of suspended sediment concentration starting in the 1960s from 11 Andean rivers at subtropical latitudes to analyse past changes in sediment export and infer its future behaviour. The recent decade has experienced anomalously high sediment concentration in most glacierized catchments, but the 1970s experienced even higher values. Decadal variations in the relationship between sediment concentration and ice melt suggest that the magnitude of the current decade was lower due to reduced glacial sediment rather than other factors. Combining this result with the fact that glacial runoff is decreasing, it is inferred that, for most of the glacierized catchments, the peak sediment generated by the anthropogenic deglaciation started two centuries ago has already passed its maximum.

 The implementation of water-surface photovoltaic systems as a source of renewable power has expanded rapidly worldwide in recent decades. Water-surface photovoltaic avoids negative impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, while the impacts on aquatic physical and chemical properties and biodiversity are unclear. To understand the ecological and environmental impacts of water-surface photovoltaic systems, here we conducted a field survey on water physical and chemical properties, plankton and bird communities of 26 water-surface photovoltaic systems in the Yangtze River basin in China during the winter and summer of 2022. We found that water-surface photovoltaic systems decreased water temperature, dissolved oxygen saturation and uncovered area of the water surface, which caused a reduction in plankton species and individual density, altering the community composition. Water-surface photovoltaic systems also caused an overall decrease in bird diversity and changed bird community compositions. These findings suggested that water-surface photovoltaic systems have impacts on the water environment and ecology.

 A large part of the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and the margins of Antarctica are melting every summer, affecting their surface mass balance. Wet/dry snow status has been detected for decades using the peaks of brightness temperature at 19 GHz, and more recently at L-band (1.4 GHz) using both the SMOS and SMAP missions. SMOS owns a longer time series than SMAP with data since 2010, but the 52.5°incidence bin in the Level 3 (L3) product from Centre Aval de Traitement des Données SMOS (CATDS) that was previously used to detect melt suffers from a coarse spatial resolution. For this reason, we developed a new SMOS enhanced resolution brightness temperature (TB) product building on the radiometer version of the Scatterometter Image Reconstruction (rSIR) algorithm. We also exploited the SMOS L1C observations near 40°incidence angle instead of 52.5°as the native spatial resolution of SMOS is better at low incidence. The new product is posted on a 12.5 km polar stereographic grid and covers all the GrIS and Antarctica for 2010–2024 with twice-daily morning and afternoon acquisitions. The effective spatial resolution was evaluated to ∼30 km, a 30% enhancement compared to the SMOS L3TB at 40°and almost a 50% enhancement compared to the SMOS L3TB at 52.5°. Then, we applied a melt detection algorithm to both the enhanced resolution product at 40°and the L3TB product at 52.5°which is used in the literature. The spatial resolution enhancement results not only in the detection of smaller melt regions but also in a widespread increase in the annual number of melt days. This increase is larger than 30 days per year in the GrIS percolation area and on multiple Antarctic ice shelves. This is primarily due to the mix of dry and wet snow regions near the ice shelves grounding line, resulting in lower brightness temperature peaks in the SMOS L3TB product due to a large power spread. These findings highlight the dependence of melt detection in particular, and geophysical applications in general, on the spatial resolution of passive microwave observations.

Epithelial injury during colitis is associated with transient stem cell reprogramming from the adult, homeostatic to a “fetal-like” regenerative state. Here, we use murine and organoid-based models to study the role ofTrp53during epithelial reprogramming. We find that p53 signaling is silent and dispensable during homeostasis but strongly up-regulated in the epithelium upon DSS-induced colitis. While in WT cells this causes termination of the regenerative state, crypts that lackTrp53remain locked in the highly proliferative, regenerative state long-term. The regenerative state in WT cells requires high Wnt signaling to maintain elevated levels of glycolysis. Instead,Trp53deficiency enables Wnt-independent glycolysis due to overexpression of rate-limiting enzyme PKM2. Our study reveals the context-dependent relevance of p53 signaling specifically in the injury-induced regenerative state, explaining the high abundance of clones lacking p53 signaling in UC and UC-associated CRC."

Many stresses, such as telomere shortening and oncogene activation, induce senescence by damaging nuclear DNA. However, the mechanisms linking DNA damage to senescence remain unclear. Here, we show that DNA damage response (DDR) signaling to mitochondria triggers senescence. A genome-wide small interfering RNA screen implicated the outer mitochondrial transmembrane protein BNIP3 in senescence induction. We found that BNIP3 is phosphorylated by the DDR kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and contributes to an increase in the number of mitochondrial cristae. Stable isotope labeling metabolomics indicated that the increase in cristae enhances fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to acetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). This promotes histone acetylation and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a. Notably, pharmacological activation of FAO alone induced senescence both in vitro and in vivo.

Here, we present a rigorous Bayesian approach to overcome these limitations, additionally taking into account intensity fluctuations, beam polarization, irregular detector shapes, incoherent scattering, and background scattering.

However, the regulatory mechanisms governing social dominance, as well as the crucial regulators and biomarkers involved, remain poorly understood. We discover that mice lacking acid-sensing ion channel 2 (ASIC2) exhibit persistently higher social dominance than their wild-type cagemates. Conversely, overexpression of ASIC2 in the medial prefrontal cortex reverses the dominance hierarchy observed in ASIC2 knockout (Asic2−/−) mice.Asic2−/−neurons exhibit increased synaptic transmission and plasticity, potentially mediated by protein kinase A signaling pathway. Furthermore, ASIC2 plays distinct functional roles in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, thereby modulating the balance of neuronal activities underlying social dominance behaviors—a phenomenon suggestive of a cell subtype–specific mechanism. This research lays the groundwork for understanding the mechanisms of social dominance, offering potential insights for managing social disorders, such as depression and anxiety."

In response to double-strand DNA breaks, p53 exhibits pulses of expression, but how it achieves temporal coordination of downstream responses remains unclear. Here, we show that p53’s posttranslational modification state is altered between its first and second pulses of expression. We show that acetylations at two sites, K373 and K382, were reduced in the second pulse, and these acetylations differentially affected p53 target genes, resulting in changes in gene expression programs over time.

When and how this functional shift was accomplished has remained difficult to decipher from the fossil record alone. Through biomechanical modeling of hindlimb force-generating performance in eight exemplar fossil synapsids, we demonstrate that the erect locomotor regime typifying modern therians did not evolve until just before crown Theria. Modeling also identifies a transient phase of increased performance in therapsids and early cynodonts, before crown mammals. Further, quantifying the global actions of major hip muscle groups indicates a protracted juxtaposition of functional redeployment and conservatism, highlighting the intricate interplay between anatomical reorganization and function across postural transitions. We infer a complex history of synapsid locomotor evolution and suggest that major evolutionary transitions between contrasting locomotor behaviors may follow highly nonlinear trajectories."

To characterize the sustainability implications of early-stage design decisions and to delineate R&D targets, an encapsulated anaerobic process model was developed and coupled with design algorithms for integrated process simulation, techno-economic analysis, and life cycle assessment under uncertainty. Across the design space, a single-stage configuration with passive biogas collection was found to have the greatest potential for financial viability and the lowest life cycle carbon emission. Through robust uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, we found technology performance was driven by a handful of design and technological factors despite uncertainty surrounding many others. Hydraulic retention time and encapsulant volume were identified as the most impactful design decisions for the levelized cost and carbon intensity of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. Encapsulant longevity, a technological parameter, was the dominant driver of system sustainability and thus a clear R&D priority. Ultimately, we found encapsulated anaerobic systems with optimized fluidized bed design have significant potential to provide affordable, carbon-negative, and distributed COD removal from high strength organic wastewaters if encapsulant longevity can be maintained at 5 years or above."

Using a high‐resolution regional atmospheric model, we shed light on the impact of ocean intrinsic variability (OIV) along GS on midlatitude‐atmosphere. Taking advantage of a 24‐member ensemble of ocean model integrations, we devised a novel experimental setup where the same weather system feels different realizations of GS sea surface temperature (SST). We introduce the “Eddy Recharge‐Frontal Lift” (ERFL) mechanism, highlighting the joint importance of synoptic variability and boundary layer processes. ERFL mechanism proposes that OIV recharges/discharges MBL with moisture and heat, while convergence associated with passing atmospheric‐fronts uplifts these MBL‐trapped anomalies to upper‐troposphere and imprints on precipitation in surprisingly short periods (a month).

We investigate the interaction between two rupture fronts as they propagate toward each other and ultimately collide. This phenomenon was observed during laboratory experiments conducted on poly methyl methacrylate. Subsequently, we used numerical simulations to elucidate key aspects of these observations and draw broader conclusions. Our findings indicate that the collision of the rupture fronts generates interface waves that propagate along the sliding interface at the Rayleigh wave speed. Additionally, the rupture fronts interact with the starting and stopping S‐wave phases radiated by the opposite rupture fronts, which can locally change their velocity and generate additional interface waves. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding earthquake source phenomena."

Wolvin;C. Strong;S. Rupper;W. J. Steenburgh,Climatology of Orographic Precipitation Gradients Over High Mountain Asia Derived From Dynamical Downscaling,"
Within High Mountain Asia (HMA), the annual melting of glaciers and snowpack provides vital freshwater to populations living downstream. Precipitation over HMA can directly affect the freshwater availability in this region by altering the mass balance of glaciers and snowpack. However, available reanalyses and downscaling simulations lack the resolution required to understand important glacier‐scale variations in precipitation. This study aimed to determine the current characteristics of orographic precipitation gradients (OPG) by curve‐fitting daily precipitation as a function of elevation from a 15‐year, 4‐km grid spaced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation focused on the Himalayan, Karakoram, and Hindu‐Kush mountain ranges. To facilitate precipitation curve‐fitting, the WRF model grid points were separated into regions of similar orientation, referred to as facets. Akaike Information Criterion‐corrected values and an F‐test p‐value identified the need for a curvature term to account for a varying OPG with elevation. Regions with similar seasonal variability were found using k $k$‐means clustering of the monthly mean OPG coefficients. The central Himalayan slope's intra‐seasonal variability of OPG depended on synoptic scale conditions, in which cyclonically‐forced heavy‐precipitation events produced strong sublinear increases in precipitation with elevation. Initial testing of precipitation estimates using monthly coefficients showed promising results in downscaling daily WRF precipitation; the daily mean absolute error at each grid point had a lower magnitude than the daily mean precipitation total, on average. Results provide a physically‐based context for machine learning algorithms being developed to predict OPG and downscale precipitation output from global climate models over HMA."
