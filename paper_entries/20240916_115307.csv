10.5194/acp-24-9401-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了航空飞行产生的尾迹对气候的影响，以及如何通过改变飞行路线来避免尾迹形成，从而减少航空业对气候的影响。论文使用卫星观测数据和气候模型来评估尾迹和二氧化碳排放对气候的影响，并比较了不同方法计算出的气候影响结果。研究发现，不同的计算方法会导致不同的结果，但对于是否应该改变飞行路线以避免尾迹形成，最终的决策结果基本一致。论文强调了选择合适的二氧化碳当量指标对于评估尾迹避免策略的重要性，并指出这最终是一个政治决策问题。,"['contrail', 'climate impact', 'CO2-equivalence', 'satellite observation', 'air traffic', 'aviation', 'atmospheric composition', 'temperature response', 'climate modeling']",Audran Borella;Olivier Boucher;Keith P. Shine;Marc Stettler;Katsumasa Tanaka;Roger Teoh;Nicolas Bellouin,The importance of an informed choice of CO2-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance,"This work studies how to compare the climate impact of the CO2 emitted and contrails formed by a flight. This is applied to contrail avoidance strategies that would decrease climate impact of flights by changing the trajectory of aircraft to avoid persistent contrail formation, at the risk of increasing CO2 emissions. We find that different comparison methods lead to different quantification of the total climate impact of a flight but lead to similar decisions of whether to reroute an aircraft. 
 One of the proposed ways to reduce the climate impact of civil aviation is rerouting aircraft to minimise the formation of warming contrails. As this strategy may increase fuel consumption, it would only be beneficial if the climate impact reduction from the avoided contrails exceeds the negative impact of any additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the rerouted flight. In this study, we calculate the surface temperature response of almost half a million flights that crossed the North Atlantic sector in 2019 and compare it to the temperature response of hypothetical rerouted flights. The climate impacts of contrails and CO2 are assessed through the perspective of CO2-equivalence metrics, represented here as nine combinations of different definitions and time horizons. We estimate that the total emitted CO2 and the persistent contrails formed will have warmed the climate by 17.2 µK in 2039, 13.7 µK in 2069, and 14.1 µK in 2119. Under an idealised scenario where 1 % additional carbon dioxide is enough to reroute all contrail-forming flights and avoid contrail formation completely, total warming would decrease by 4.9 (−28 %), 2.6 (−19 %), and 1.9 (−13 %) µK in 2039, 2069, and 2119, respectively. In most rerouting cases, the results based on the nine different CO2-equivalence metrics agree that rerouting leads to a climate benefit, assuming that contrails are avoided as predicted. But the size of that benefit is very dependent on the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics, contrail efficacy and CO2 penalty. Sources of uncertainty not considered here could also heavily influence the perceived benefit. In about 10 % of rerouting cases, the climate damage resulting from contrail avoidance indicated by CO2-equivalence metrics integrated over a 100-year time horizon is not predicted by metrics integrated over a 20-year time horizon. This study highlights, using North Atlantic flights as a case study, the implications of the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance, but the choice of metric implies a focus on a specific climate objective, which is ultimately a political decision."

However, common Fe(II)-activating oxidants including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and persulfate react slowly with Fe(II) and exhibit low selectivity for Fe(IV) production due to the cogeneration of radicals. Herein, we report peroxyacids (POAs; R–C(O)OOH) that can react with Fe(II) more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than H2O2, with high selectivity for Fe(IV) generation. Rapid degradation of bisphenol A (BPA, an endocrine disruptor) was achieved by the combination of Fe(II) with performic acid (PFA), peracetic acid (PAA), or perpropionic acid (PPA) within one second. Experiments with phenyl methyl sulfoxide (PMSO) and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) revealed Fe(IV) as the major reactive species in all three Fe(II)-POA systems, with a minor contribution of radicals (i.e., •OH and R–C(O)O•). To understand the exceptionally high reactivity of POAs, a detailed computational comparison among the Fenton-like reactions with step-by-step thermodynamic evaluation was conducted. The high reactivity is attributed to the lower energy barriers for O–O bond cleavage, which is determined as the rate-limiting step for the Fenton-like reactions, and the thermodynamically favorable bidentate binding pathway of POA with iron. Overall, this study advances knowledge on POAs as novel Fenton-like reagents and sheds light on computational chemistry for these systems."

The micropollutant elimination process underwent two phases: an initial slow degradation phase (0–10 min) followed by a rapid phase (10–20 min). Multiple evidence demonstrated that a PICA-Mn(IV) complex (PICA-Mn(IV)*) was generated, acting as a conductive bridge facilitating the electron transfer between PMS and micropollutants. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that PMS readily oxidized the PICA-Mn(II)* to PICA-Mn(IV)*. This intermediate then complexed with PMS to produce PICA-Mn(IV)-PMS*, elongating the O–O bond of PMS and increasing its oxidation capacity. The primary transformation mechanisms of typical micropollutants mediated by PICA-Mn(IV)-PMS* include oxidation, ring-opening, bond cleavage, and epoxidation reactions. The toxicity assessment results showed that most products were less toxic than the parent compounds. Moreover, the Mn(II)/PICA/PMS system showed resilience to water matrices and high efficiency in real water environments. Notably, PICA-Mn(IV)* exhibited greater stability and a longer lifespan than traditional reactive oxygen species, enabling repeated utilization. Overall, this study developed an innovative, sustainable, and selective oxidation system, i.e., Mn(II)/PICA/PMS, for rapid water decontamination, highlighting the critical role of in situ generated Mn(IV)."

However, the interactions of an organic contaminant with catalytic centers and participating ROS are complex and lack an in-depth understanding. In this work, we observed an abnormal phenomenon in AOPs that the degradation of electron-rich phenolics, such as 4-methoxyphenol, acetaminophen, and 4-presol, was unexpectedly slower than electron-deficient phenolics in a Mn(II)/nitrilotriacetic acid/peroxymonosulfate (Mn(II)/NTA/PMS) system. The established quantitative structure–activity relationship revealed a volcano-type dependence of the degradation rates on the Hammett constants of pollutants. Leveraging substantial analytical techniques and modeling analysis, we concluded that the electron-rich phenolics would inhibit the generation of both primary (Mn(III)NTA) and secondary (Mn(V)NTA) high-valent manganese species through complexation and competition effects. Specifically, the electron-rich phenolics would form a hydrogen bond with Mn(II)/NTA/PMS through outer-sphere interactions, thereby reducing the electrophilic reactivity of PMS to accept the electron transfer from Mn(II)NTA, and slowing down the generation of reactive Mn(III)NTA. Furthermore, the generated Mn(III)NTA is more inclined to react with electron-rich phenolics than PMS due to their higher reaction rate constants (8314 ± 440, 6372 ± 146, and 6919 ± 31 M–1 s–1 for 4-methoxyphenol, acetaminophen, and 4-presol, respectively, as compared with 671 M–1 s–1 for PMS). Consequently, the two-stage inhibition impeded the generation of Mn(V)NTA. In contrast, the complexation and competition effects are insignificant for electron-deficient phenolics, leading to declined reaction rates when the Hammett constants of pollutants increase. For practical applications, such complexation and competition effects would cause the degradation of electron-rich phenolics to be more susceptible to water matrixes, whereas the degradation of electron-deficient phenolics remains largely unaffected. Overall, this study elucidated the intricate interaction mechanisms between contaminants and reactive metal species at both the electronic and kinetic levels, further illuminating their implications for practical treatment."

We provide the first spacecraft measurements of k2 ${k}_{2}$ and Q $Q$ at two frequencies, monthly and yearly, from an analysis of Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter radio tracking data. Interior modeling indicates that these values can be matched only with a low‐viscosity zone at the base of the lunar mantle, even when using complex rheological laws to model the mantle's response. The existence of this zone has profound implications for the Moon's thermal state and evolution."

Göckede,Large Eddy Simulations of the Interaction Between the Atmospheric Boundary Layer and Degrading Arctic Permafrost,"Arctic permafrost thaw holds the potential to drastically alter the Earth's surface in Northern high latitudes. We utilize high‐resolution large eddy simulations to investigate the impact of the changing surfaces onto the neutrally stratified atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). A stochastic surface model based on Gaussian Random Fields modeling typical permafrost landscapes is established in terms of two land cover classes: grass land and open water bodies, which exhibit different surface roughness length and surface sensible heat flux. A set of experiments is conducted where two parameters, the lake areal fraction and the surface correlation length, are varied to study the sensitivity of the boundary layer with respect to surface heterogeneity. Our key findings from the simulations are the following: The lake areal fraction has a substantial impact on the aggregated sensible heat flux at the blending height where surface heterogeneities become horizontally homogenized. The larger the lake areal fraction, the smaller the sensible heat flux. This result gives rise to a potential feedback mechanism. When the Arctic dries due to climate heating, the interaction with the ABL may accelerate permafrost thaw. Furthermore, the blending height shows significant dependency on the correlation length of the surface features. A longer surface correlation length causes an increased blending height. This finding is of relevance for land surface models concerned with Arctic permafrost as they usually do not consider a heterogeneity metric comparable to the surface correlation length."

In this study, we examined the LF magnetic fields measured in Malacca, Malaysia, to probe reflection heights of the lower ionosphere near the equator on three different nights in 2021. The results show that the virtual ionospheric height at nighttime typically ranged from 82.0 to 90.0 km, with a mean value of 85.3 km. Our measurements also revealed significant variations in the virtual ionospheric height across different regions over a spatial scale of about 800 km. The maximum height difference was about 5.0 km. Moreover, the fluctuation characteristics are observed in both estimated ionospheric height and calculated peak reflection ratio during similar periods. This fluctuation may be related to atmospheric gravity waves in the nighttime ionosphere. In addition, we compared the virtual ionospheric height estimated from CG strokes of different polarities, and the results showed that the virtual reflection height for positive CG strokes is lower than that for negative ones."

Measurements characterizing precipitation in low‐level mixed‐phase clouds, which frequently form over the SO, are rare, and our understanding of precipitation efficacy within these clouds remains limited. The simulated surface precipitation bias has an indirect effect on determining global climate sensitivity and a direct impact on the hydrological cycle. This study investigates the representation of low clouds, cloud variability, and precipitation statistics over the SO in real‐case Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) simulations at the kilometer scale. The simulations are contrasted with 48 hr of continuous shipborne observations of open and closed‐cell stratocumuli, south of Tasmania. Our simulations show the significance of heavily rimed particle formation, their in‐cloud growth, and subcloud melting to capture the observed cloud‐precipitation vertical structure. In addition, supercooled drizzle formation impacts the vertical structure and precipitation statistics. ICON captures the observed intermittency of precipitation even at a standard vertical resolution of 200 m in the boundary layer but only captures the observed sparse distribution of intense precipitation (>1 mm hr−1) when the maximum vertical resolution is reduced to 100 m. However, the simulations of the 2‐day accumulated precipitation and the radiative effect are largely insensitive to the vertical resolution.

Our results show a decrease in future emissions, leading to a decrease in modeled AOD under both RCPs after 2030. The RCP4.5 scenario shows a 48%–65% decrease in AOD by the end of the century, with the Indo‐Gangetic Plain (IGP) experiencing a maximum change of ∼ ${\sim} $25% by 2030 compared to 2010. Conversely, RCP8.5 showed an increase in AOD of ∼ ${\sim} $29% by 2050 and did not indicate a significant decrease by the end of the century. Our study also highlights that it is likely to take three decades for current policies to be effective for regions heavily polluted by exposure to carbonaceous aerosols, such as the IGP and eastern India.

We reproduced this incident using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) at a convection‐permitting resolution. We found that this case of tropical upper‐level turbulence occurred primarily due to the fast‐growing convective tower in the unstable layer created by gravity wave breaking. At lower altitudes, a mesoscale convective system (MCS) caused a decrease in wind speed in both upstream and downstream regions. At upper levels, a large‐scale jet descended and accelerated after flowing over the top of the MCS, which acted like a barrier and produced a situation similar to a downslope windstorm due to mountain terrain. Upper‐level turbulence is 2–3 km higher than the top of the MCS. The critical level above the jet and the locally self‐induced critical level created the locally enhanced descending jet stream, which destabilized the flow through Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities. The convective tower existed near the flight route and played an important role in triggering turbulence in the unstable environment through its convective gravity waves."

Incorporating dynamic vegetation processes reduced global SIF root‐mean‐squared error (RMSE) by 12%. Offline experiments were conducted to understand the water and carbon cycles and their interactions using satellite data as constraints. Results indicate that soil hydraulic properties, the soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation (Ks) and the water retention curve, significantly impact soil moisture and SIF simulation, especially in the semi‐arid regions. The wilting point and maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate (Vmax) affect photosynthesis and transpiration, then soil moisture. However, without atmospheric feedback processes, their effects on soil moisture are undermined due to the compensation between soil evaporation and transpiration. With optimized parameters based on SMAP L3 and OCO‐2 data, the global RMSE of soil moisture and SIF simulations decreased by 15% and 12%, respectively.

 The deleterious impact of antibiotics (ATB) on the microbiome negatively influences immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) response in patients with cancer. We conducted a randomized phase I study (EudraCT:2019-A00240-57) with 148 healthy volunteers (HV) to test two doses of DAV132, a colon-targeted adsorbent, alongside intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA), piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) or ceftriaxone (CRO) and a group without ATB. The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of DAV132 on ATB plasma concentrations and both doses of DAV132 did not alter ATB levels. Secondary objectives included safety, darkening of the feces, and fecal ATB concentrations. DAV132 was well tolerated, with no severe toxicity and similar darkening at both DAV132 doses. DAV132 led to significant decrease in CZA or PTZ feces concentration. When co-administered with CZA or PTZ, DAV132 preserved microbiome diversity, accelerated recovery to baseline composition and protected key commensals. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in preclinical cancer models in female mice from HV treated with CZA or PTZ alone inhibited anti–PD-1 response, while transplanted samples from HV treated with ATB + DAV132 circumvented resistance to anti–PD-1. This effect was linked to activated CD8+ T cell populations in the tumor microenvironment. DAV132 represents a promising strategy for overcoming ATB-related dysbiosis and further studies are warranted to evaluate its efficacy in cancer patients.

This study presents a haplotype-based pangenome that uncovers substantial genetic diversity associated with climate adaptation and enables predictions of genetic vulnerability under future emission scenarios. 
 Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), an ecologically and economically important forest species in East Asia, plays vital roles in carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. However, intensifying climate change threatens moso bamboo survival. Here we generate high-quality haplotype-based pangenome assemblies for 16 representative moso bamboo accessions and integrated these assemblies with 427 previously resequenced accessions. Characterization of the haplotype-based pangenome reveals extensive genetic variation, predominantly between haplotypes rather than within accessions. Many genes with allele-specific expression patterns are implicated in climate responses. Integrating spatiotemporal climate data reveals more than 1050 variations associated with pivotal climate factors, including temperature and precipitation. Climate-associated variations enable the prediction of increased genetic risk across the northern and western regions of China under future emissions scenarios, underscoring the threats posed by rising temperatures. Our integrated haplotype-based pangenome elucidates moso bamboo’s local climate adaptation mechanisms and provides critical genomic resources for addressing intensifying climate pressures on this essential bamboo. More broadly, this study demonstrates the power of long-read sequencing in dissecting adaptive traits in climate-sensitive species, advancing evolutionary knowledge to support conservation. Moso bamboo is a critical species for carbon sequestration and mitigating climate change.

 Virulence factor genes (VFGs) play pivotal roles in bacterial infections and have been identified within the human gut microbiota. However, their involvement in chronic diseases remains poorly understood. Here, we establish an expanded VFG database (VFDB 2.0) consisting of 62,332 nonredundant orthologues and alleles of VFGs using species-specific average nucleotide identity (

A thorough characterization of VFGs for 5452 commensal isolates from healthy individuals reveals that only 11 of 301 species harbour these factors. Further analyses of VFGs within the gut microbiomes of nine chronic diseases reveal both common and disease-specific VFG features. Notably, in type 2 diabetes patients, long HiFi sequencing confirms that shared VF features are carried by pathobiont strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. These findings underscore the critical importance of identifying and understanding VFGs in microbiome-associated diseases.

 We previously reported that normothermic ex vivo kidney  perfusion (NEVKP) is superior in terms of organ protection compared to static cold storage (SCS), which is still the standard method of organ preservation, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. We used a large animal kidney autotransplant model to evaluate mitochondrial function during organ preservation and after kidney transplantation, utilizing live cells extracted from fresh kidney tissue. Male porcine kidneys stored under normothermic perfusion showed preserved mitochondrial function and higher ATP levels compared to kidneys stored at 4 °C (SCS). Mitochondrial respiration and ATP levels were further enhanced when AP39, a mitochondria-targeted hydrogen sulfide donor, was administered during warm perfusion. Correspondingly, the combination of NEVKP and AP39 was associated with decreased oxidative stress and inflammation, and with improved graft function after transplantation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the organ-protective effects of normothermic perfusion are mediated by maintenance of mitochondrial function and enhanced by AP39 administration. Activation of mitochondrial function through the combination of AP39 and normothermic perfusion could represent a new therapeutic strategy for long-term renal preservation.

Here, authors show that preferred conformations of RyR2 variants linked either to heart failure or inherited sudden cardiac death are similar, suggesting a common cause and potential treatment. 
 Heart failure, the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed world, is characterized by cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 channels that are hyperphosphorylated, oxidized, and depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabin-2. This results in a diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak that impairs cardiac contractility and triggers arrhythmias. Genetic mutations in ryanodine receptor 2 can also cause Ca2+ leak, leading to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Here, we solved the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of ryanodine receptor 2 variants linked either to heart failure or inherited sudden cardiac death. All are in the primed state, part way between closed and open. Binding of Rycal drugs to ryanodine receptor 2 channels reverts the primed state back towards the closed state, decreasing Ca2+ leak, improving cardiac function, and preventing arrhythmias. We propose a structural-physiological mechanism whereby the ryanodine receptor 2 channel primed state underlies the arrhythmias in heart failure and arrhythmogenic disorders.

 The metabolomic profile of aging is complex. Here, we analyse 325 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) biomarkers from 250,341 UK Biobank participants, identifying 54 representative aging-related biomarkers associated with all-cause mortality. We conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for these 325 biomarkers using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 95,372 individuals and perform multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analyses, discovering 439 candidate “biomarker - disease” causal pairs at the nominal significance level. We develop a metabolomic aging score that outperforms other aging metrics in predicting short-term mortality risk and exhibits strong potential for discriminating aging-accelerated populations and improving disease risk prediction.

Here, authors developed machine learning models to predict ice recrystallisation inhibition by small molecules, showcasing a data-driven approach for cryoprotectant discovery. 
 Controlling the formation and growth of ice is essential to successfully cryopreserve cells, tissues and biologics. Current efforts to identify materials capable of modulating ice growth are guided by iterative changes and human intuition, with a major focus on proteins and polymers. With limited data, the discovery pipeline is constrained by a poor understanding of the mechanisms and the underlying structure-activity relationships. In this work, this barrier is overcome by constructing machine learning models capable of predicting the ice recrystallisation inhibition activity of small molecules. We generate a new dataset via experimental measurements of ice growth, then harness predictive models combining state-of-the-art descriptors with domain-specific features derived from molecular simulations. The models accurately identify potent small molecule ice recrystallisation inhibitors within a commercial compound library. Identified hits can also mitigate cellular damage during transient warming events in cryopreserved red blood cells, demonstrating how data-driven approaches can be used to discover innovative cryoprotectants and enable next-generation cryopreservation solutions for the cold chain.

 Some communities endure environmental hazards from abandoned mines and job loss from the energy transition away from coal. Recent US legislation provides a historic appropriation for abandoned mine hazards like the acidic water that often drains from them. Who the investment will benefit and what it will accomplish is unclear. Here we provide answers for the case of abandoned mine drainage in Pennsylvania. We find that communities most exposed to mine drainage have incomes 30 percent below that of unaffected communities and are twice as vulnerable to the energy transition. Within affected communities, exposure is associated with a greater urban, non-white, renter population. Analytical modeling using data from past treatment efforts shows that they have been relatively cost effective, protecting streams for about $5700 per kilometer per year. Federal appropriations for Pennsylvania could address all impaired streams for 25 years but would leave insufficient funding for other abandoned mine hazards. In Pennsylvania, incomes are lower in communities with streams damaged by abandoned mine drainage, but these streams could be protected cost-effectively, according to an analysis combining demographic, economic, hydrological, and cost data."

 High-quality land-use/land-cover mapping with optical remote sensing images yet presents significant work. Even though fully convolutional semantic segmentation models have recently contributed to popular solutions, the lack of annotation data may lead to severe degradations in their inference performance. Besides, the category confusion in high-resolution representations will further exacerbate the adverse effects. In this paper, we propose a category-sensitive semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework to address these weaknesses by employing massive unlabeled data. With the perturbations from adopted hybrid data augmentation structures, we first focus on the output space and execute regularization constraints to learn category-specific discriminative features. It is formulated with a consistency self-training procedure where a dynamic class-balanced threshold selection scheme is proposed to provide high-confident pseudo supervisions for each category. In addition, we introduce pixel-wise contrastive learning on the common embedding space from both labeled and unlabeled data domains to further facilitate the semantic dependencies among category features, in which the reliable labels are leveraged as guidance for pixel sample selection. We verify the proposed framework on two benchmark land-use/land-cover datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its competitive performance to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods."
