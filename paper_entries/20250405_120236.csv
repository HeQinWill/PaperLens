The most common method for determining spatial wind speed patterns in cities relies on numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which resolve Navier–Stokes equations around buildings. While effective, these simulations are computationally intensive and require specialised expertise, limiting their broader applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a more cost-effective alternative while achieving 90 performance in capturing the mean and maintaining spatial wind patterns captured by CFD. We developed a machine learning (ML) approach with U-net architecture to predict time mean wind speed patterns from prevailing wind directions and three-dimensional urban morphology, which are increasingly available for global cities. The model is trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 512 numerical simulations of urban neighbourhoods, representing diverse morphological configurations in cities worldwide. We find that the ML algorithm accurately predicts complex wind patterns, achieving a normalised mean absolute error of less than 10 , which is comparable to wind anemometer measurement in a low wind speed environment. In predicting wind statistics, the ML model also surpasses that of regression models based solely on statistical representations of urban morphology. The R2 values measuring grid-level agreement between ML and CFD range from 0.94–0.99 and 0.65–0.95 for the idealised and whole datasets, respectively. However, we find that grid-based R2 is not an effective metric for evaluating the 2D model performance due to localised biases arising from faster wind speed grid regions, which is revealed by the wind probability density function. These findings demonstrate that complex pedestrian wind patterns can be effectively predicted using an image-based ML approach, offering the potential to emulate physics-based large-eddy simulation models, which are computationally expensive, thereby significantly reducing computing costs."

Due to the high demand for food security, driven by rapid population growth and national initiatives to reduce dependency on rice imports, rice cultivation is intensified in West Africa. However, its contribution to atmospheric CH4 remains largely unknown. Here, for the first time, cutting-edge eddy covariance tower measurements were conducted parallelly in a rice field (Janga) and a reserve forest (Mole National Park), both located in the Guinea savanna region of West Africa. Using CH4 measurement data from June to October 2023 (rice cultivation period), the dynamic interplay between methane emissions from rice cultivation and its potential mitigation through forest methane uptake was assessed. Our results show that the rice field acted as a net source of CH4 at a rate of 2037 mgCH4m−2, whereas the most intense flooded period (August) accounted for 70% of the total emissions. On the other hand, the forest reserve acted as a sink, with a net uptake of −560 mgCH4m−2, and the highest uptake observed in October. Accounting for the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 over a 20 year period, the forest had a wet season negative GWP of −47.04 gCO2eq, while the rice field emitted CH4 of 171.36 gCO2eq. This implies that under similar conditions during the measurement campaigns, the forest per square area needs approximately a factor of ∼4 to balance the positive radiative effect per square area of rice cultivated. This work emphasizes the need to integrate forests to compensate for methane released by rice cultivation in the semi-arid West African savannah region."

To guide decision-making around testing, deploying, and regulating CDR as part of a portfolio of climate mitigation strategies, we need to better understand how the deep sea and broader Earth system would respond to increased biomass addition. The central processes driving this response are sensitive to choices about biomass type and storage site, and they span spatial and temporal scales from microns to kilometers and from minutes to millennia. To organize this interdisciplinary challenge, we define five generalizable phases for biomass-based marine carbon storage projects: inputs, placement, short-term response, long-term response, and functional stability. Each phase is associated with observational needs with characteristic spatial and temporal scales that could be met through direct field measurements, investigations of analog sites, experiments, and/or models. Predicting the effects of potential interventions over global and centennial scales will require the strategic integration of diverse observational types into process-based Earth System models that can be used to support planning. Beyond assessing carbon storage and ensuring regulatory compliance, future research should therefore prioritize generating the data required to improve models for impacts of biomass-based marine carbon storage at climatically-relevant scales."

However, the contributions of thermodynamic and dynamic processes resulting from internal climate variability and external forcing to the non-uniform warming rates remain unclear. In this study, we attribute the Eurasian multidecadal temperature variations by using a combination of low-frequency component analysis and the dynamical adjustment method. We show that anthropogenic forcing has caused pronounced non-linear warming, particularly over Europe–West Asia (EWA) and Northeast Asia (NEA). In contrast, internal variability is manifested as a meridional tripole pattern tightly linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Silk Road Pattern. Furthermore, we reveal that the forced SAT changes are strongly influenced by forced thermodynamic processes, which contribute more than 62.4% (62.4% – 99.5%) to the forced long-term warming over EWA and NEA. The contributions of internal thermodynamic and dynamic processes on decadal scales are more complex, as dynamic processes contribute ∼50% to the internal multidecadal SAT variations over NEA, while thermodynamic processes account for approximately 86% of the internal SAT variations over EWA. Our study not only detects and attributes multidecadal summer SAT variations, but also provides strong evidence for the decisive role of different thermodynamic and dynamic processes in the non-uniform multidecadal warming over Eurasia."

Global decarbonization, national governance, and local impacts in the Indonesian nickel industry","The shift to low-carbon societies will require large amounts of energy transition materials for batteries to support intermittent renewable energy generation. While this energy transition is still at an early phase, the risks of negative social and environmental impacts associated with the extraction of these materials are becoming increasingly apparent. The challenges associated with resource extraction are well documented. However, there are significant gaps in knowledge about how the energy transition reconfigures natural resource governance and how this shapes impacts from resource extraction. This knowledge is critical for understanding the full impact of transition policies, and for identifying opportunities for, and barriers, to more sustainable and just extractive practices. We contribute to addressing this gap by exploring how Indonesian nickel governance has been reconfigured and centralized in the context of early energy transition efforts, and examining the social and environmental impacts this is having in Sulawesi, Indonesia, one of the largest nickel production areas in the world. Drawing on 88 interviews and six focus group discussions with key stakeholders, we show that while this centralization has enabled a 14-fold increase in extraction rates over a 10 year period, it has also resulted in a series of well-known negative social and environmental impacts that degrade important ecosystem services and threaten health, livelihoods, and ways of life. Importantly, these impacts are exacerbated by the rapidly shrinking political space for local participation caused by the centralization of nickel governance, highlighting the tension between urgency in up-scaling extraction of energy transition materials and undertaking a just low-carbon transition. Reflecting and addressing this tension will be essential to designing policies that can achieve just outcomes while successfully addressing the current nature and climate crisis."

Here, some knowledge gaps and opportunities to narrow this gap are discussed. Merely adopting practices (e.g., regenerative agriculture, conservation agriculture, cover crops) based on their intended C benefits with limited consideration of the mechanisms affecting C gains will not result in significant atmospheric C capture in the soil profile. Biomass C input primarily drives soil C gains. Yet, the aboveground and belowground biomass C input in croplands even under improved practices such as no-till is mostly concentrated near the soil surface and, in some climates, does not exceed minimum thresholds. Low biomass productivity and limited biomass input into the soil profile probably constrain C gains more than other factors (e.g., initial soil C, C priming, duration, soil texture). Designing or redesigning strategies that photosynthetically capture some of the abundant atmospheric C in deeper soil profile should be first on our agenda. This includes introducing high aboveground and belowground biomass producing forages, perennials, and cover crops, while balancing with food production. C-depleted soils or marginally productive croplands may have a high potential for C storage, but climate, a strong predictor of biomass production, merits consideration. Overall, many factors affect C gains, but none probably are as critical as boosting biomass C input into the soil profile if the goal is to narrow the C gap."

In particular, we explore the potential expansion of Italy’s current atmospheric ICOS network by identifying additional existing and future stations that would most effectively improve the constraint of carbon flux estimations, with a focus on the southern region. Through a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments using the LUMIA regional inverse system, we evaluated 23 potential stations and identified Chieti (CHI, located in the Abruzzo region in mid-Italy) and Lecce (ECO, located in the southeastern Puglia region) as the most promising additions. These stations demonstrated significant value in recovering the annual and seasonal cycles of the assumed true CO2 fluxes (simulated by LPJ-GUESS) in southern Italy. Incorporating both CHI and ECO into the current network reduces the prior biases by approximately 82%, compared to the 48% reduction achieved when adding the CHI station alone. Our findings also suggest that adding more stations beyond CHI and ECO results in only marginal gains in flux precision. We therefore emphasize the need for targeted research funding to support the integration of these current and future stations into the ICOS atmospheric network in southern Italy, where the current network is sparse, with only Potenza as an ICOS atmospheric station. This research highlights the importance of strategic station selection to optimize network performance and improve regional carbon flux assessments, ultimately contributing to better reconciliation and understanding of discrepancies between bottom–up and top–down greenhouse gas estimation methods."
10.5194/acp-25-3873-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了平流层硫酸盐气溶胶在晴空条件下的辐射强迫和反馈与地表温度的依赖关系。论文使用一维辐射-对流平衡模型，发现硫酸盐气溶胶的辐射强迫随着地表温度的升高而减弱，而二氧化碳的辐射强迫变化较小。这是因为硫酸盐气溶胶主要吸收大气光学薄的波长，从而掩盖了随温度升高而增加的地表辐射。此外，气溶胶的存在还会减弱辐射反馈。这项研究强调了气溶胶长波吸收的光谱特性在决定强迫的地表温度依赖性和减少反馈方面的重要作用。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究结果对于理解气溶胶对气候的影响以及提高气候模型的准确性具有重要意义，而这些模型通常会用到卫星观测数据，因此与大气环境遥感技术，尤其是大气成分分析，有较强的关联性。,"['stratospheric sulfate aerosol', 'radiative forcing', 'radiative feedback', 'surface temperature', 'atmospheric composition', 'longwave radiation', 'climate modeling']",Ravikiran Hegde;Moritz Günther;Hauke Schmidt;Clarissa Kroll,Surface temperature dependence of stratospheric sulfate aerosol clear-sky forcing and feedback,"Using a one-dimensional radiative–convective equilibrium model, we show that in clear-sky conditions, stratospheric sulfate aerosol forcing weakens with increasing surface temperature while CO2 forcing varies much less. This effect arises as sulfate aerosol, unlike CO2, absorbs mainly at wavelengths where the atmosphere is optically thin. It thereby masks the surface emission, which increases with warming. The spectral masking also results in weaker radiative feedback when aerosol is present. 
 Stratospheric sulfate aerosol originating from explosive volcanic eruptions can perturb the radiative budget for several years. However, the understanding of the state dependence of aerosol forcing and its effect on the radiative feedback is still incomplete. Using a one-dimensional radiative–convective equilibrium model of the tropical atmosphere, we quantify the contributions to clear-sky forcing and feedback from absorbing and re-emitting longwave radiation, stratospheric heating, and enhanced stratospheric water vapour. We show that aerosol forcing has a stronger surface temperature dependence than CO2 forcing. At surface temperatures from 280 to 300 K, the aerosol forcing becomes less negative (weaker) with increasing surface temperature because its longwave component becomes more positive. Additionally, the radiative feedback is less negative in the presence of the aerosol. The dependence of the feedback parameter on the aerosol concentration and of the forcing magnitude on temperature arises from the same process: aerosol absorbs in the spectral range in which the atmosphere is optically thin and thus spectrally masks the temperature-dependent surface emissions. The study highlights the critical role played by the spectral nature of aerosol longwave absorption in determining the surface temperature dependence of the forcing and in reducing the feedback in comparison to an atmosphere without stratospheric aerosol."

Our modeling revealed that OA in China increased by 5.6 % from 1990 to 2019, primarily due to a 32.3 % increase in secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) and an 8.1 % decrease in primary organic aerosols (POAs), both largely driven by changes in anthropogenic emissions. Biogenic SOA increased due to warming but showed little response to changes in anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emissions. 
 Organic aerosol (OA) is a major type of fine particulate matter. OA shows a large variability influenced by anthropogenic emissions, vegetation, and meteorological changes. Understanding OA trends is crucial for air quality and climate studies, yet changes in OA over time in China are poorly documented. This study applied the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 with comprehensive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry (CAM6-Chem) to investigate long-term OA trends in China from 1990 to 2019 and identify the driving factors. The simulations agreed well with ground-based measurements of OA from 151 observational sites and the CAQRA reanalysis dataset. Although OA trends showed a modest 5.6 % increase, this resulted from a significant −8.1 % decrease in primary organic aerosols (POAs) and a substantial 32.3 % increase in secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Anthropogenic emissions of POA and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were the dominant contributors to these trends. While biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) played a secondary role in SOA formation, significant changes were observed in specific subspecies: isoprene-derived SOA decreased by −18.8 % due to anthropogenic sulfate reduction, while monoterpene-derived SOA increased by 12.3 % driven by enhanced emissions from rising temperatures. Through sensitivity experiments, our study found a negligible response of monoterpene-derived SOA to changes in anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions as a net effect of changes in multiple pathways. This study highlights the complex interplay between POA reduction and SOA growth, revealing notable OA trends in China and the varying roles of both anthropogenic and biogenic emissions."

Accurate global measurements of these particles are crucial for estimating this cooling effect. This study compares and harmonizes two newly developed global aerosol datasets, offering insights for their future use and refinement. We identify pristine oceans as a significant source of uncertainty in the datasets and, therefore, in quantifying the role of aerosols in Earth's climate. 
 Quantifying global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations is crucial for reducing uncertainties in radiative forcing resulting from aerosol–cloud interactions. This study analyses two novel, independent, open-source global CCN datasets derived from spaceborne Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) measurements and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis and examines the spatio-temporal variability of CCN concentrations pertinent to liquid clouds. The results reveal consistent large-scale patterns in both CALIOP and CAMS datasets, although CALIOP values are approximately 79 % higher than those from CAMS. Comparisons with the existing literature demonstrate that these datasets effectively bound regionally observed CCN concentrations, with CALIOP typically representing the upper bound and CAMS the lower bound. Monthly and annual variations in CCN concentrations obtained from the two datasets largely agree over the Northern Hemisphere and align with previously reported variations. However, inconsistencies emerge over pristine oceans, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, where the datasets show not only opposing seasonal changes but also contrasting annual trends. Seasonal cycles in these regions are well represented in CAMS, consistent with previous in situ observations, while annual trends seems to be better captured by CALIOP. A comparative study of trends in CCN and cloud droplet concentrations suggests that dust-influenced and pristine maritime environments are primary regions that limit our current understanding of CCN–cloud droplet relationships. Long-term CCN observations in these regions are crucial for improving global datasets and advancing our understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions."

We find residence time depends strongly on injection height in the lower stratosphere. We show that the lifetime of stratospheric aerosol from the 1991 Pinatubo eruption is around 22 months, significantly longer than is commonly reported. 
 The amount of time that volcanic aerosols spend in the stratosphere is one of the primary factors influencing the climate impact of volcanic eruptions. Stratospheric aerosol persistence has been described in different ways, with many works quoting an approximately 12-month “residence time” for aerosol from large tropical eruptions. Here, we aim to develop a framework for describing the evolution of global stratospheric aerosol after major volcanic eruptions and quantifying its persistence, based on global satellite-based aerosol observations, tracer transport simulations, and simple conceptual modelling. We show that the stratospheric residence time of air, which is estimated through passive tracer pulse experiments and is one factor influencing the lifetime of stratospheric aerosols, is strongly dependent on the injection latitude and height, with an especially strong sensitivity to injection height in the first 4 km above the tropical tropopause. Simulated stratospheric tracer evolution is best described by a simple model which includes a lag between the injection and initiation of removal from the stratosphere. Based on analysis of global stratospheric aerosol observations, we show that the stratospheric lifetime of stratospheric aerosol from the 1991 Pinatubo eruption is approximately 22 months. We estimate the potential impact of observational uncertainties on this lifetime, finding it unlikely the lifetime of Pinatubo aerosol is less than 18 months."

 Information about the energy density of gravity waves (GWs) is crucial for improving atmosphere models. So far, most space-based studies report the potential energy, Epot, of GWs, as temperature measurements from satellites are more common.We use Aeolus wind data to derive the kinetic energy density, Ekin, of GWs above the northern Atlantic and Europe. Assuming perfect instrument performance, this would be a lower limit for the kinetic energy density, as Aeolus only measures the horizontal line-of-sight wind. Aeolus, the European Space Agency's (ESA's) fourth Earth Explorer Mission, was the first Doppler wind lidar in space and measured vertical profiles of the horizontal line-of-sight wind from the ground to an altitude of ∼ 20–30 km between 2018 and 2023. With a vertical resolution of 0.25–2 km, Aeolus measurements are in principle well suited for the analysis of GWs. However, the data quality is a challenge for such analyses, as the error in the data is in the range of typical GW amplitudes in the troposphere and stratosphere.In this study, we derive daily resolved time series of Ekin before, during, and after two streamer events above the northern Atlantic and Europe. Streamers are large-scale tongue-like structures of meridionally deflected air masses, which are caused by enhanced planetary wave activity. They are linked to vertical shear of horizontal wind and a pressure system, two possible GW generation mechanisms. We find that there is a temporal coincidence between the enhanced daily averaged Ekin and occurrence of the streamer events, which we identified in total column ozone measurements. The derivation of GW signals based on Aeolus data is possible, however: we collected about 100 profiles to statistically reduce the uncertainty in the daily averaged Ekin. Compared to non-satellite measurements, those daily averaged values are at the upper border."

The aim of the algorithm is to save researchers working on these tasks significant amounts of time and allow them to proceed with their analysis. The work demonstrates that this algorithm can achieve the goal of speeding up analysis and provide accurate formulas. 
 Mass spectrometry is an established method for studying the chemical composition of gases and particles in the atmosphere. Using this technique, signals corresponding to thousands or even tens of thousands of compounds may be detected from ambient air. The process of identifying all the peaks in the mass spectra is often arduous and time-consuming, in particular when multiple overlapping peaks are present. This manual peak fitting and identification may take even experienced analysts anywhere from weeks to months to complete, depending on the desired accuracy and completeness.In this work, we attempted to automate the fitting and formula assignment workflow and evaluate how far the process can get using a “one-button” algorithm. The algorithm constructed in this work takes in commonly known parameters specific to the instrument type, and by pressing one button it runs and ultimately provides a list of likely peaks for the mass spectrum. The algorithm utilizes weighted-least-squares fitting and a modified version of the Bayesian information criterion along with an iterative formula assignment process. We applied it to synthetic mass spectra and both a gas-phase chemical-ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) dataset and an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) dataset. The results were largely comparable with manual peak fitting and identification done previously but were achieved in a fraction of the time. Erroneous assignments mainly appeared at low-intensity signals, with interference from nearby higher-intensity signals, a case that is challenging also for manual peak fitting. This algorithm provides an excellent starting point for a peak list, which, if needed, can be manually revised.The main result of this study is the algorithm itself. While further improvements and tweaks are possible, the algorithm presented here is currently being implemented into the commonly used Tofware analysis software package to allow easy utilization by the broader community.

Sensitivity tests demonstrate the complexity and nonlinear interactions of auxiliary parameters in the air mass factor calculation. An improved agreement is found with measurements from a global ground-based instrument network. The scientific retrieval provides a useful source of information for studies combining HCHO and NO2. 
 The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite launched in October 2017, is dedicated to monitoring the atmospheric composition associated with air quality and climate change. This paper presents the global retrieval of TROPOMI tropospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical columns using an updated version of the Peking University OMI NO2 (POMINO) algorithm, which focuses on improving the calculation of air mass factors (AMFs). The algorithm features explicit corrections for the surface reflectance anisotropy and aerosol optical effects, and it uses daily high-resolution (0.25°×0.25°) a priori HCHO and NO2 profiles from the Global Earth Observing System Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) dataset. For cloud correction, a consistent approach is used for both HCHO and NO2 retrievals, where (1) the cloud fraction is recalculated at 440 nm using the same ancillary parameters as those used in the NO2 AMF calculation, and (2) the cloud-top pressure is taken from the operational FRESCO-S cloud product.The comparison between POMINO and reprocessed (RPRO) operational products in April, July and October 2021 as well as January 2022 exhibits high spatial agreement, but RPRO tropospheric HCHO and NO2 columns are lower by 10 % to 20 % over polluted regions. Sensitivity tests with POMINO show that the HCHO retrieval differences are mainly caused by different aerosol correction methods (implicit versus explicit), prior information on vertical profile shapes and background corrections, while the NO2 retrieval discrepancies result from different aerosol corrections, surface reflectances and a priori vertical profile shapes as well as their nonlinear interactions. With explicit aerosol corrections, the HCHO structural uncertainty due to the cloud correction using different cloud parameters is within ±20 %, mainly caused by cloud height differences. Validation against ground-based measurements from global Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations and the Pandonia Global Network (PGN) shows that in April, July and October 2021 as well as in January 2022 POMINO retrievals present a comparable day-to-day correlation but a reduced bias (normalized mean bias, NMB) compared to the RPRO products (HCHO: R=0.62, NMB=-30.8% versus R=0.68, NMB=-35.0%; NO2: R=0.84, NMB=-9.5% versus R=0.85, NMB=-19.4%). An improved agreement of the HCHO/NO2 ratio (FNR, formaldehyde to nitrogen dioxide ratio) with  MAX-DOAS and PGN measurements based on POMINO retrievals is also found (NMB: −14.8 % versus −21.1 %). Our POMINO retrieval provides a useful source of information, particularly for studies combining HCHO and NO2."

Overall, 18 sites have multi-year observations, while 16 were observed only during the 2012 growing season, totaling 1513 site months. This dataset can be used to explore carbon exchange, assess ecosystem responses to climate change, support upscaling studies, and evaluate carbon cycle models. 
 The eddy covariance (EC) technique is currently the most widely used method for measuring carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere at the ecosystem scale. Using this technique, a regional carbon flux network comprising a total of 34 sites has been established in the Heihe River basin (HRB) in northwest China. This network has been measuring the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 for a variety of vegetation types. In this study, we have compiled and post-processed half-hourly flux data from these 34 EC flux sites in the HRB to create a continuous, homogenized time series dataset. We employ standardized processing procedures to fill data gaps in meteorological and NEE measurements at half-hourly intervals. NEE measurements are also partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). Furthermore, half-hourly meteorological and NEE data are aggregated into daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly timescales. As a result, we produced a continuous carbon flux and auxiliary meteorological dataset, which includes 18 sites with continuous multi-year observations during 2008–2022 and 16 sites observed only during the 2012 growing season, amounting to a total of 1513 site months. Evapotranspiration and energy flux measurements are also included. Using the post-processed dataset, we explored the temporal and spatial characteristics of carbon exchange in the HRB. In the diurnal variation curve, GPP, net carbon uptake, and Reco peak later for ecosystems in the artificial oasis (cropland and wetlands) compared to those outside the artificial oasis (grassland, forest, woodland, and Gobi/desert). Seasonal net carbon uptake, GPP, and Reco peak in early July for grassland, forest, woodland, and cropland but remain close to zero throughout the year for Gobi/desert. In the last decade, net carbon uptake of wetlands has significantly increased, while NEE for other ecosystems has not exhibited significant trends. Annual net carbon uptake, GPP, and Reco are significantly higher for sites inside the artificial/natural oasis compared to those outside the oasis. This post-processed carbon flux dataset has numerous applications, including exploring the carbon exchange characteristics of alpine and arid ecosystems, analyzing ecosystem responses to climate extremes, conducting cross-site synthesis from regional to global scales, supporting regional and global upscaling studies, interpreting and calibrating remote sensing products, and evaluating and calibrating carbon cycle models.

Using a deep neural network, we established a flame retardancy prediction model with an accuracy of 0.90. Employing the SHapley Additive exPlanations approach, we have identified the Morgan 507 (P═N connected to a benzene ring) and 114 (quaternary carbon) substructures as promoting units in flame retardancy. Subsequently, approximately 600 compounds were selected as OPFR candidates from the ZINC database. Further refinement was achieved through a comprehensive scoring system that incorporated absorption, toxicity, and persistence, thereby yielding six prospective candidates. We experimentally validated these candidates and identified compound Z2 as a promising candidate, which was not toxic to zebrafish embryos. Our methodological framework leverages AIPD to effectively guide the discovery of novel flame retardants, significantly reducing both developmental time and costs."

However, little work has been done to understand other environmental consequences of this potential shift. In this work, we assess the consumptive water use of these two technologies for nine commercial building archetypes across the continental U.S. To do so, we modeled on-site water use for EC, electric energy consumed by both VC and EC systems, and water consumed by electricity generation at a regional level. We find that while indirect water use for EC systems is less than that of VC systems by approximately 50%, EC systems consume around 5–8 times as much water overall, owing to their on-site water use. The largest differences occur in the hot, humid climates of the Southeastern U.S. due to the region’s large cooling needs and saturated atmosphere. Together, these findings indicate the need to design EC systems that include condensation steps in more closed-loop designs."

This study addresses this critical knowledge void by utilizing a whole-body inhalation exposure system to investigate the distribution, accumulation, and pulmonary toxicity of polystyrene MP/NP (1.5 × 105 particles/m3) in male ICR mice (n = 16/group). Fluorescently labeled MP/NP revealed the highest particle accumulation in the lungs, followed by the bloodstream and spleen, with minimal detection in the brain. Unsurprisingly, 80 nm nanoplastics displayed greater intertissue transport efficiency than 1 μm microplastics. Chronic exposure to both microplastics and nanoplastics disrupted oxidative balance and exacerbated oxidative stress within the extracellular environment of the lungs. The impaired antioxidant defenses and disrupted intra- and extracellular metabolism led to inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. Intriguingly, 1 μm microplastics induced more severe pulmonary toxicity than their smaller counterparts, promoting epithelial–mesenchymal transition and fibrosis.

Understanding the fate and mobility of heavy metals during this process is important. This study focuses on Pb and the effect of zinc (Zn) on Pb in carbon mineralization. Synthesized gypsum was treated with a carbonate-rich solution at pH 11.5 to convert the sulfates to carbonates. Aqueous solutions and mineral solids were analyzed. Synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence and a novel application of Pb M3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure provided detailed insights into Pb distribution and mineral forms. Results showed significant reductions in aqueous Pb and Zn concentrations, indicating effective metal sequestration. Carbon mineralization transformed Pb from soluble anglesite (PbSO4) into insoluble cerussite (PbCO3) and hydrocerussite (Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2). Pb primarily precipitated onto calcium carbonate surfaces through surface-mediated precipitation reactions. While the presence of Zn modified crystallization dynamics, it did not impede Pb sequestration and potentially enhanced surface reactivity, facilitating greater Pb immobilization.

Freeze–thaw cycles commonly occur in the atmosphere, surface water, and soil in cold regions; however, their effects on Hg(0) oxidation, particularly during environmentally relevant freeze–thaw processes, remain unknown. Here, we investigated the freeze-induced dark oxidation of Hg(0) by potential reactive oxygen species under controlled freeze–thaw conditions. Freeze–thaw cycles (25 to −20 to 25 °C and 10 to −10 to 10 °C) accelerated the oxidation of Hg(0) compared with constant 25/10 °C, especially in acidic solutions (pH 4.0). Subsequent characterization and radical quenching experiments confirmed that the spontaneously produced hydroxyl radical (•OH) was the predominant oxidant responsible for Hg(0) oxidation. Notably, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) loading at environmental levels did not accelerate Hg(0) oxidation, suggesting that the observed oxidation is distinct from the mechanism of the freeze-concentration effect (Hg(0) and H2O2 enrichment increase the oxidation rate) as previously documented. This work demonstrated a novel pathway for Hg(0) oxidation driven by the spontaneous production of •OH at the liquid–ice interface, independent of H2O2. This research highlights that the interfacial •OH production can affect the environmental behavior of Hg(0) with important implications for understanding its fate, particularly in the atmosphere."

Gas-phase reaction of methoxyphenols with nitrate radicals (NO3) yields to important secondary products like nitrophenols, yet their atmospheric kinetics are far from adequate and consistent. This study investigates the gas-phase reaction kinetics of guaiacol, a key representative methoxyphenol, with NO3 by using a controlled 30 m3 indoor chamber. Both relative rate and absolute rate methods were employed, yielding rate constants of (3.1 ± 0.2) × 10–11 and (2.43 ± 0.19) × 10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, respectively, at 298 ± 2 K under dry conditions. The rate constant decreased with an increase in humidity, highlighting the inhibitory effect of water vapor on NO3-initiated reactions. The calculated nocturnal atmospheric lifetime of guaiacol due to NO3 reactions is less than 2 min at typical nocturnal NO3 levels, underscoring the significance of this pathway in the budget of methoxyphenols during nighttime or within a 24 h cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first determination of the NO3-guaiacol rate constant using the absolute rate method and provides insights into the role of relative humidity in methoxyphenol oxidation.

This study, however, provides physical insights into two main possible processes, secondary gravity waves (GWs) and Lamb waves, which may explain those observed large‐scale thermospheric disturbances.

Using double‐cylinder shear experiments on wet granular systems as analogs for landslide lateral faults, we observe anomalous shear stress variations with fluid volume fractions, defying an expected unimodal relationship associated with capillary cohesion. At low fluid volume fractions, shear strength weakens as the wet grain assembly experiences reduced lateral pressure and increased boundary slip. This boundary slip subsequently vanishes, with an abrupt strengthening due to the dilation of the grain assembly against fluid surface tension as saturation approaches. Strike‐slip motion and confinement in this system explain the strength anomaly, highlighting a critical role of lateral faults in landslide stability, particularly in cases where dynamics cannot be adequately explained by monitored pore‐water pressure or basal friction."

All prior studies considered enhancing cloud albedo only with fine aerosols (FA). Adding coarse sea spray aerosols (CSA, radius>1 μm) has been thought to have the opposite effect. Using nearly a decade of satellite observations and global aerosol reanalysis, we found that the maximum radiative cooling effect from marine stratocumulus occurs when FA is around 3 μg m−3 and CSA is around 30 μg m−3. Under low winds and high stability conditions, optimal FA and CSA can enhance cooling by −95 W m−2, nearly 60% more than adding FA alone. This CRE response to FA and CSA was consistently observed across various cloud‐controlling factors, thus minimizing the probability of being caused by meteorological co‐variability.

Using the Community Earth System Model, we conduct a paleoclimate sensitivity study focused on modifying ice nucleation and cloud phase partitioning schemes. These modifications increase the GMST, with a strong temperature rise in high latitudes and a muted increase in the tropics. These increases are driven by enhanced longwave cloud forcing, resulting from increased ice cloud amounts and cloud water content, and are amplified by water vapor and lapse rate feedbacks in the Arctic.

The strong easterly acceleration was due to a similar contribution from resolved waves and parameterized gravity waves, but largely counteracted by an upward advection of westerly momentum. The significant anomaly in the mean winds was not restricted to the 82 km height, but also included strong westerly winds (∼50 m s−1) at 65 km and easterly winds (∼40 m s−1) at 42 km.

Gulf Stream meanders in this region induce sea level fluctuations that propagate along the entire SAB shelf. Using an idealized barotropic model, we further demonstrate that topographic waves mediate the propagation of the Gulf Stream signal onto the shelf. Moreover, the Gulf Stream variability is driven by zonal wind stress in the Northwest Atlantic, which is likely modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation.

Various surface elements in drylands are closely related and studying their long‐term coupling processes and mechanisms is beneficial for managing global warming impacts on drylands. This article reports on a new aeolian sedimentary sequence since the Last Deglaciation (LD) in Hexi Corridor. Combined with our previous eolian and lacustrine sedimentary sequences in the surrounding area, we found a unique regional climate‐water‐dust coupling process. This coupled pattern is a combined response to Northern Hemisphere solar radiation, ice sheets, and North Atlantic freshwater forcing since the LD. The melting of permafrost during the LD period and substantial erosion of the rivers originating in the Qilian Mountains jointly destroyed the stability of the surface conditions in the Hexi Corridor. Alluvial fans in the plain released a large amount of dust, which quickly accumulated in the upstream mountainous areas after transportation, thereby forming a dust cycle. However, the warmer Middle Holocene experienced stable surface conditions and weak dust activity owing to abundant water resources. As human activities continue to intensify, the climate‐water‐dust coupling process in this region is closely related to human interference with the surface environment, which is entirely different from the situation where natural processes predominate.

However, there have been few systemic assessments of the response of orbital‐scale East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) variability to the iNHG, partly due to controversies regarding the interpretation of the dominant orbital rhythms of the EASM. Here, we present grain size and other proxy records from mainly silt‐sized lacustrine‐fluvial deposits in northern China. The results shows that the EASM underwent stepwise weakening at ∼2.7 and ∼1.8 Ma, coincident with two major cooling steps of the global climate and that its dominant orbital periodicity changed from ∼41 kyr during ∼3.6–2.7 Ma, to ∼100 kyr during ∼2.7–1.8 Ma. However, these findings are inconsistent with the strengthening of the 41‐kyr cyclicity in marine δ18O records after the iNHG, whereas they are consistent with northern high‐latitude sea surface temperature records that bear the imprint of local climate signals when the Arctic ice sheets were of limited extent during the Early Pleistocene. We propose that the dominant ∼41‐kyr cyclicity during the Late Pliocene resulted from obliquity‐induced changes in the meridional insolation gradient, or in heat and moisture transport from low latitudes; whereas the dominant ∼100‐kyr cyclicity during ∼2.7–1.8 Ma reflects an increased response to northern high‐latitude forcing.

Low‐level moisture flux convergence due to the land breeze front controls the progression of convection, typically a squall line, away from the coast overnight. However, the diurnal convection over the mountains occurs on only 57% of days in December–February (DJF) and propagates offshore on only 49% of those days. We investigate day‐to‐day variability in dynamical and thermodynamical conditions to explain the variability in diurnal convection and offshore propagation, using a convection‐permitting simulation run for 900 DJF days. A convolutional neural network is used to identify regimes of the diurnal cycle and offshore propagation behavior. The diurnal cycle and offshore propagation are most likely to occur ahead of an active Madden‐Julian oscillation, or during El Niño or positive Indian Ocean Dipole; however, any regime can occur in any phase of these large‐scale drivers, because the major control arises from the local scale. When the diurnal cycle of convection occurs over land, low‐level wind is generally onshore, providing convergence over the mountains, and low‐level humidity over the mountains is high enough to make the air column unstable for moist convection. When this convection propagates offshore, midlevel offshore winds provide a steering flow, combined with stronger convergence offshore due to more onshore environmental winds. Low‐level moisture around the coast also means that as the convection propagates, the storm‐relative inflow of air into the system adds greater instability than would be the case on other days."

However, accurate identification of CH4 sources for reducing CH4 emissions is often hampered by inadequate accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage of CH4 detection, and lack of accurate CH4 forward modeling used in top‐down inversion systems. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in Pampa, Texas using two CH4 sensors (LI‐COR and OGI camera) to detect CH4 releases. We investigated whether high‐resolution simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with greenhouse gases (WRF‐GHG) could accurately simulate the CH4 plumes in the presence of evolving atmospheric boundary layer from sunrise to noon. CH4 plumes showed substantial variation in time. At a release rate of ∼17.5 kg hr−1, the maximum enhancement of CH4 measured by LI‐COR was 2.6 ppm at sunrise (7:36 a.m.), 250 m from the release location. Within half an hour after sunrise, this enhancement decreased to 0.3–0.4 ppm. The enhancement was 0.2 ppm by 10:00 a.m. and further dropped to less than 0.1 ppm after 11:30 a.m. Due to the low temperature at sunrise, the OGI camera failed to detect the CH4 plume. The WRF‐GHG large‐eddy simulation (LES) with 32 m grid spacing successfully reproduced these CH4 enhancements. In situ measurements together with numerical simulations illustrate the impact of the transition from a stable boundary layer in the early morning to a convective boundary layer at noon on the dispersion of CH4 plumes. Additionally, CH4 plumes from a cattle farm in Oklahoma are briefly examined using the same modeling approach."

South Asia, especially its northwesternmost part, is emerging as a global hotspot for thunderstorms and lightning, driven by dynamic interactions between the orography of the TP and the South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM). This study used TRMM satellite observations from 1998 to 2013, combined with ERA‐5 reanalysis data and the HYSPLIT trajectory model, to comprehensively investigate how thunderstorms in the region impact the atmospheric composition over the TP. The findings reveal that thunderstorms in the region predominantly occur during the SASM. Spatially, these thunderstorms are concentrated along the southern Himalayan front, especially in the westernmost indentation between the TP and the Iranian Plateau, an area also characterized by heavy anthropogenic pollution. By employing the HYSPLIT model to trace transport pathways associated with the thunderstorm, the study demonstrates a clear convergence of pollutants from the South Asia boundary layer into thunderclouds. Furthermore, three principal transport pathways were identified for substances originating from the tops of thunderstorms entering the TP. These pathways are closely linked to the tropospheric westerlies, the anticyclonic circulation of the South Asian High, and processes penetrating the tropopause, accounting for approximately 58%, 33%, and 9% of thunderstorms, respectively. Notably, the impact of these thunderstorm‐driven transport processes on the TP and even the lower stratosphere is expected to intensify as thunderstorms become more frequent and pollution levels rise in South Asia due to global warming and local social development."

This paper extends the investigation to both the US Rocky Mountain (RM) region and the TP, considering the 1998 summer drought/flood event in North America/East Asia, respectively, as a case study. A previously developed initialization method for land surface temperature/subsurface temperature (LST/SUBT) is used in the NCEP Global Forecast System, coupled with a land model, SSiB2 (GFS/SSiB2), to produce observed RM cold May temperature anomaly. Forward simulation yields June precipitation anomalies at five remote locations. Likewise, the TP warm May temperature anomaly also produces June precipitation anomalies at these five locations. The effects of RM (cold) and TP (warm) temperature anomalies are consistent in the US South Coastal regions and the south Yangtze River Basin, yielding 49% (42%) of observed drought and 34% (44%) of observed flood, respectively. These LST/SUBT effects in RM and TP induce a global large‐scale wave train linking North America with the TP, affecting the subtropical westerly jet and thereby modulating summer precipitation. Global SST effect is examined for comparison but does not yield statistically significant June precipitation anomalies in GFS/SSiB2. This study adds to evidence that high‐mountain LST effects in the RM and TP are first‐order sources of S2S precipitation predictability in summer months."

The North Pacific (NP) AR climatology in the boreal winter to early fall seasons in a QBO easterly (QBOE) phase is systematically shifted poleward compared with those in a QBO westerly (QBOW) phase, and such difference peaks in the local late spring season. We also find the similar poleward shift for the AR climatology over the South Pacific (SP) in the austral winter seasons in the QBOE phase. A significant equatorward shift and an overall enhancement of the AR climatology over the SP are observed in the QBOE phase during local spring and summer seasons, respectively. The QBO impacts on the AR climatology over the Atlantic Ocean are less organized. Strong QBO impacts exist in almost all seasons for the North Atlantic AR but only in the austral spring season for the South Atlantic AR. These QBO modulations of the AR climatology over the ocean basins also change the season‐mean AR frequencies around coastal regions, suggesting significant QBO impacts on the local land‐falling AR events. The QBO modulations of the seasonal background mean states and the MJO‐teleconnections are two potential mechanisms mostly over the north hemisphere. The QBOE modulation of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO)‐teleconnection over the northern hemisphere is asymmetric between the MJO convection over the Indian Ocean and that over the Pacific Ocean, which is the key to explain the QBO influences on the AR activity on the seasonal timescale."

Before implementing OAE at climate‐relevant scales, questions about its safety and verifiability must be addressed. Operational deployment poses a dilemma between pursuing large detectability, essential for effective monitoring, reporting, and verification, and ensuring environmental safety and satisfying regulatory requirements. In this study, we present a computationally efficient approach, based on a high‐resolution, coupled circulation‐dissolution model of Halifax Harbor, to simulating the addition, transportation, dissolution, and sinking of various theoretical alkaline feedstocks for different dosages, seasons, and addition sites. Detectability and exposure risk of OAE are quantified and an approach for optimizing OAE deployment is demonstrated. Mean residence times (MRT) are calculated for different subregions and seasons. Results show that for a given amount of feedstock, summer is more favorable from the perspective of detectability but also creates higher exposure risks than other seasons because of a longer MRT. The exposure risk can be mitigated while maintaining large detectability by choosing optimal feedstocks with different characteristics for different seasons. The exposure risk can also be reduced by spreading alkalinity over multiple addition sites. The optimum allocation, where the largest detectability is sought without violating regulatory requirements, is specific to each season, dosage, and choice of feedstock. OAE deployments should be tailored taking into account local hydrography, season, dosage, and feedstock characteristics. Our approach provides a practical avenue for optimizing deployments."

 Deracemization is an emerging strategy for generating enantioenriched compounds wherein the two enantiomers of a readily available racemic starting material are transformed into a single enantiomer, typically through the action of a light-induced catalyst1,2. Excellent proof of principle for this potentially powerful approach to asymmetric catalysis has been described3–8; nevertheless, substantial challenges have not yet been addressed, including the exploitation of carbon–heteroatom (rather than only carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon) bond cleavage to achieve deracemization, as well as the development of processes that provide broad classes of useful enantioenriched compounds and tetrasubstituted stereocentres. Here we describe a straightforward method that addresses these challenges, using a chiral copper catalyst, generated in situ from commercially available components, to achieve the photoinduced deracemization of tertiary (and secondary) alkyl halides through carbon–halogen bond cleavage. Mechanistic studies (including the independent synthesis of postulated intermediates, photophysical, spectroscopic and reactivity studies, and density functional theory calculations) provide support for the key steps and intermediates in our proposed catalytic cycle, as well as insight into the origin of enantioselectivity.

 Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia1–5. Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects6–9. Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system10. Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence. Using a natural experiment that avoids common bias concerns, this study finds that the live-attenuated shingles vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis within a follow-up period of 7 years by approximately one-fifth."

Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula.

 Accumulating evidence indicates that antibiotic exposure may lead to impaired vaccine responses1–4; however, the mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. Here we prospectively followed 191 healthy, vaginally born, term infants from birth to 15 months, using a systems vaccinology approach to assess the effects of antibiotic exposure on immune responses to vaccination. Exposure to direct neonatal but not intrapartum antibiotics was associated with significantly lower antibody titres against various polysaccharides in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylribitol phosphate and diphtheria toxoid antigens in the combined 6-in-1 Infanrix Hexa vaccine at 7 months of age. Blood from infants exposed to neonatal antibiotics had an inflammatory transcriptional profile before vaccination; in addition, faecal metagenomics showed reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species in these infants at the time of vaccination, which was correlated with reduced vaccine antibody titres 6 months later. In preclinical models, responses to the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were strongly dependent on an intact microbiota but could be restored in germ-free mice by administering a consortium of Bifidobacterium species or a probiotic already widely used in neonatal units. Our data suggest that microbiota-targeted interventions could mitigate the detrimental effects of early-life antibiotics on vaccine immunogenicity.

 Photons can carry angular momentum, which is conventionally attributed to two constituents—spin angular momentum (SAM), which is an intrinsic property related to the polarization, and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is related to the photon spatial distribution. In paraxial optics, these two forms of angular momentum are separable1, such that entanglement can be induced between the SAM and the OAM of a single photon2,3 or of different photons in a multi-photon state4. In nanophotonic systems, however, the SAM and the OAM of a photon are inseparable5,6, so only the total angular momentum (TAM) serves as a good quantum number7–9. Here we present the observation of non-classical correlations between two photons in the near-field regime, giving rise to entanglement related to the TAM. We entangle those nanophotonic states by coupling photon pairs to plasmonic modes and use quantum imaging techniques10,11 to measure their correlations. We observe that entanglement in TAM leads to a completely different structure of quantum correlations of photon pairs, compared with entanglement related to the two constituent angular momenta.

 Although Earth, together with other terrestrial planets, must have had an early-formed protocrust, the chemical composition of this crust has received little attention. The protocrust was extracted from an extensive magma ocean formed by accretion and melting of asteroidal bodies1. Both experimental and chronological data suggest that the silicate melt ascending from this magma ocean formed in equilibrium with, or after, metal was extracted to form Earth’s core. Here we show that a protocrust formed under these conditions would have had incompatible (with respect to silicate minerals) trace-element characteristics remarkably similar to those of the current average continental crust. This has major implications for subsequent planetary evolution. Many geochemical arguments for when and how plate tectonics began implicitly assume that subduction is required to produce the continental trace-element signature. These arguments are severely compromised if this signature was already a feature of the Hadean protocrust.

 Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximized metal use and discrete energy levels hold promise for broad applications in heterogeneous catalysis, energy conversion, environmental science and biomedicine1–7. The activity and stability of SACs are governed by the pair of metal–adsorbate and metal–support interactions8–10. However, the understanding of these interactions with their catalytic performance in nature is challenging. Correlations of activity with the charge state of metal atoms have frequently reached controversial conclusions11–15. Here we report that the activity of palladium (Pd1) SACs exhibits a linear scaling relationship with the positions of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of oxide supports across 14 types of semiconductor. Elevation of the LUMO position by reducing the support particle size to a few nanometres boosts a record high activity along with excellent stability in the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. We show that the elevated LUMO of support reduces its energy gap with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Pd1 atoms, which promotes Pd1–support orbital hybridizations for high stability and further amends the LUMO of anchored Pd1 atoms to enhance Pd1–adsorbate interactions for high activity. These findings are consistent with the frontier molecular orbital theory and provide a general descriptor for the rational selection of metal–support pairs with predictable activity.

 Recently the quest for post-silicon semiconductors has escalated owing to the inherent limitations of conventional bulk semiconductors, which are plagued by issues such as drain-induced barrier lowering, interfacial-scattering-induced mobility degradation and a constrained current on/off ratio determined by semiconductor bandwidth. These challenges have prompted the search for more advanced materials, with atomic-layer-thick two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors emerging as a potential solution. Following over a decade of research advances, recent developments1–3 in wafer-scale growth and device fabrication have led to breakthroughs in 2D semiconductor electronics. However, the level of integration remains constrained to a few hundred transistors. We describe a reduced instruction set computing architecture (RISC-V) microprocessor capable of executing standard 32-bit instructions on 5,900 MoS2 transistors and a complete standard cell library based on 2D semiconductor technology. The library contains 25 types of logic units. In alignment with advances in silicon integrated circuits, we also co-optimized the process flow and design of the 2D logic circuits. Our combined manufacturing and design methodology has overcome the significant challenges associated with wafer-scale integration of 2D circuits and enabled a pioneering prototype of an MoS2 microprocessor that exemplifies the potential of 2D integrated-circuit technology beyond silicon.

Kwan,Psilocybin’s lasting action requires pyramidal cell types and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors,"A pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin’s long-term drug action. 
 Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with therapeutic potential for treating mental illnesses1–4. At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity5,6, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodelling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells7–9. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell-type-specific circuits to produce the psychedelics’ behavioural actions10. Here we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation and cell-type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increases the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviourally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin’s ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin’s effects on stress-related behaviour and structural plasticity. Collectively, these results identify that a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin’s long-term drug action.

 Thromboinflammation occurs in various diseases, leading to life-threatening microvascular occlusion with resulting end-organ failure1–4. Importantly, how microvascular thromboinflammation resolves remains poorly understood due to the small size-scale of microvasculature and the long duration (weeks to months) of this process. Here we introduce a hydrogel-based thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model with long-term culture capabilities to model microvascular thromboinflammation and monitor clot resolution over clinically and physiologically relevant timescales (up to months). Using this system, we mapped out the distinct temporal phases of clot resolution in microvascular thromboinflammation. Using multiplexed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with our thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model, we observed that inflammation shifts the endothelium fibrinolytic balance to favour thrombosis and pinpointed neutrophil elastase as a double-edged sword that induces clot resolution but also tissue damage. We then investigated the mechanisms of potential therapeutic agents that either prevent microvascular thrombosis or accelerate clot resolution. Specifically, we observed that, in thromboinflammation, (1) early tissue plasminogen activator administration within 3 h directly improves endothelial barrier function; (2) prophylactic defibrotide and enoxaparin suppress microvascular thromboinflammation through endothelium-mediated mechanisms; and (3) combining enoxaparin with crizanlizumab reduces microvascular occlusion and protects endothelial function in sickle cell disease. These data introduce a paradigm in investigating the underlying mechanisms of thromboinflammatory clot resolution and conducting drug discovery thereof.

Witten,A neural mechanism for learning from delayed postingestive feedback,"Illness signals from the gut reactivate and strengthen flavour representations in the amygdala to support learning from delayed postingestive feedback. 
 Animals learn the value of foods on the basis of their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic1–10 and preferences to those that are nutritious11–13. However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel14,15, but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning. Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval). By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences. Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback. Illness signals from the gut reactivate and strengthen flavour representations in the amygdala to support learning from delayed postingestive feedback."

 Anthropogenic biodiversity decline threatens the functioning of ecosystems and the many benefits they provide to humanity1. As well as causing species losses in directly affected locations, human influence might also reduce biodiversity in relatively unmodified vegetation if far-reaching anthropogenic effects trigger local extinctions and hinder recolonization. Here we show that local plant diversity is globally negatively related to the level of anthropogenic activity in the surrounding region. Impoverishment of natural vegetation was evident only when we considered community completeness: the proportion of all suitable species in the region that are present at a site. To estimate community completeness, we compared the number of recorded species with the dark diversity—ecologically suitable species that are absent from a site but present in the surrounding region2. In the sampled regions with a minimal human footprint index, an average of 35% of suitable plant species were present locally, compared with less than 20% in highly affected regions. Besides having the potential to uncover overlooked threats to biodiversity, dark diversity also provides guidance for nature conservation. Species in the dark diversity remain regionally present, and their local populations might be restored through measures that improve connectivity between natural vegetation fragments and reduce threats to population persistence. A comparison of alpha diversity (number of plant species) and dark diversity (species that are currently absent from a site despite being ecologically suitable) demonstrates the negative effects of regional-scale anthropogenic activity on plant diversity."

 Flowering plant sexual reproduction requires double fertilization, yielding embryo and endosperm seed compartments: the latter supports embryo growth and seed germination. In an experiment to generate haploid embryos through inhibition of pollen phospholipase activity in sunflower (Helianthus annus), we serendipitously discovered that emasculated sunflowers spontaneously form parthenogenic haploid seed. Exploration of genetic, chemical and environmental factors demonstrated that a specific genotype background enabled high parthenogenesis and that full spectrum high-intensity light supplementation boosted parthenogenesis, yielding hundreds of haploid seeds per head. Induction of doubled haploid plants can greatly accelerate plant breeding efficiency; however, despite successful engineering of haploid induction in many crops, few reported systems are commercially scalable1. Here we report efficient methods of chemical emasculation and genome doubling to produce fertile plants and enable a scalable sunflower doubled haploid system.

 Human RAD52 is a multifunctional DNA repair protein involved in several cellular events that support genome stability, including protection of stalled DNA replication forks from excessive degradation1–4. In its gatekeeper role, RAD52 binds to and stabilizes stalled replication forks during replication stress, protecting them from reversal by SMARCAL1 motor3. The structural and molecular mechanism of the RAD52-mediated fork protection remains elusive. Here, using P1 nuclease sensitivity, biochemical and single-molecule analyses, we show that RAD52 dynamically remodels replication forks through its strand exchange activity. The presence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA at the fork modulates the kinetics of the strand exchange without impeding the reaction outcome. Mass photometry and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy show that the replication fork promotes a unique nucleoprotein structure containing head-to-head arrangement of two undecameric RAD52 rings with an extended positively charged surface that accommodates all three arms of the replication fork. We propose that the formation and continuity of this surface is important for the strand exchange reaction and for competition with SMARCAL1.

 Inhaled therapeutics have high potential for the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases of high unmet medical need, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Preclinical and early clinical evidence show that cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2), previously called connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is a promising target for the treatment of IPF. In recent phase 3 clinical trials, however, systemic CCN2 inhibition failed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit. Here, we present the preclinical profile of the inhaled anti-CCN2 Anticalin® protein PRS-220. Our study demonstrates that efficient pulmonary delivery directly translates into superior efficacy in relevant models of pulmonary fibrosis when compared to systemic CCN2 inhibition. Moreover, we present a holistic approach for the preclinical characterization of inhaled PRS-220 from state-of-the art in vitro and in vivo models to novel human ex vivo and in silico models, highlighting the advantage of inhaled drug delivery for treatment of respiratory disease.

 Abundant geomorphological, biological, and isotopic records show that Arabia repeatedly underwent significant climate-driven environmental changes during late Quaternary humid periods. Precisely mapping how the enhancement and expansion of the African Monsoon during these humid periods have affected landscape evolution and human occupation dynamics in Arabia remains a scientific challenge. Here we reconstruct an ancient water-sculpted landscape consisting of lake and river deposits, coupled with a large outlet valley in the Rub’ al Khali Desert of Saudi Arabia. During the peak of the Holocene Humid Period or before, intense rainfall reactivated alluvial floodplains and filled a ~1100 km² topographic depression, which eventually breached, carving a deep ~150 km-long valley. Coupling geologic reconstructions with transient Earth system model simulations shows that this hydrological activity was linked to higher seasonal precipitation punctuated by repeated heavy events. Analysis of lacustrine and fluvial sedimentary deposits implies sediment routing across distances of up to 1000 km from the Asir Mountains. Our results indicate that such intense flooding challenges the conventional view of simple, weak, and linear landscape stabilization following increased rainfall in Arabia. Our findings highlight the crucial role of an enhanced African Monsoon in driving rapid landscape transformations in the Arabian Desert.

 The capacity of mangroves to reduce coastal flood risk resulted in legislation for mandatory widths of mangrove greenbelts in several countries with mangrove presence. Prescribed forest widths vary between 50 and 200 m. Here, we performed 216,000 numerical model runs informed by realistic conditions to quantify confidence in wave reduction capacity of mangroves for wind and swell waves. This analysis highlights that tidal flat areas fronting mangrove forests already account for 70% of reduction in wave heights. Within mangrove forests that are below 500 m wide, wave dissipation is strongly dependent on local water levels, wave characteristics and forest density. For forest widths of over 500 m, which constitute 46% of global coastal mangroves, around 75% or more of the incoming wave energy is dissipated. Hence, for relying on mangroves to dampen shorter waves, a new standard should be adopted that strives for mangrove widths of 500 m or more.

 Phytoplankton play a major role in carbon export and storage in the ocean interior through remineralization of particulate carbon into dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and represent the “gain” side of the biological carbon pump. Shifts in phytoplankton community structure and species succession impact primary production, quality of food for zooplankton consumers and the fate of organic matter in marine ecosystems.In the Labrador Sea (LS), a sub-arctic environment, the emergence of large blooms of Phaeocystis spp. in spring at the expenses of diatoms may disrupt phytoplankton species succession with drastic consequences on the carbon cycle and the functioning of the marine ecosystem as these small flagellates aggregate in colonies of up to several millimeters, embedded in gelatinous matrices, that modify elemental stoichiometry, sinking rates and transfer of energy to higher trophic levels. In this study, we develop an ecological approach to estimate primary production due to Phaeocystis sp. in the LS from satellite remote sensing data. We used a regionally-tuned primary production model to assign phytoplankton photosynthesis efficiency as a function of oceanographic regimes defined by phytoplankton community structure and biomass, and sea-surface temperature. We found that four oceanographic regimes corresponded to broad phytoplankton taxonomic assemblages and environmental factors in the LS: the diatom-dominated Shelf, the low chlorophyll-a Basin, the mesotrophic Basin regimes and a last oceanographic regime within the Basin, where the flagellated prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis spp. likely dominated the assemblage. Annual primary production in the Labrador Sea varied between 200 and 300 Tg of carbon between 2014 and 2022 in agreement with previous studies. While Phaeocystis spp. contributed about 10 % of the annual production, two unusual blooms that occurred in 2015 and 2022 contributed about 14 and 20 % of total production, respectively. During these two events Phaeocystis sp. contributed 40 % and 60 % to the May production and extended over more than half the Labrador Sea. Spring blooms dominated by Phaeocystis may occur more frequently due to climate change and have the potential to impact the fate of carbon and alter the functioning of the LS ecosystem."

 Seasonal phenological transformations alter tree appearances, notably by influencing the size and color of the foliage. It has long been anticipated that such phenology induced characteristics can help address the tree-species recognition problem, a fundamental challenge in forest science. Yet, studies on tree-species recognition using remote sensing and phenological characteristics have been rare, due to the very limited availability of high spatiotemporal resolution observations. Moreover, the interactions between the effectiveness of phenological characteristics, remote sensing data, and the analytical methodologies have not yet been sufficiently explored. The understanding of how to integrate multi-temporal observations and phenological characteristics in tree-species recognition has been lacking. This study aims to identify principles for optimizing species recognition by combining data, methods, and phenological dynamics. This involves understanding the impact factors of various methodologies, and how they interact with phenological characteristics and datasets at different times and/or frequencies. The study was carried out using multi-temporal high-resolution optical images of a temperate forest, which were collected in 2021 during leaf growth and senescence periods between May and October, i.e., three leaf growth (May–August) and three leaf senescence (September–October) periods. The test site comprised 14 different tree classes, including 11 species, 2 genera, and 1 dead tree class. The experimental results showed that, for deep learning approaches, the current main limitations in the tree species recognition lie in sample imbalance as the targeted species number increases. With the state-of-the-art data and methods, distinguishing between species within a same genus is much more challenging than differentiating between species from different genera or families. It is also revealed that the best timing for tree species classification is early autumn (September) or late spring (May) when a single-temporal (one-timepoint) data is applied; all-temporal (six-timepoint) data improves the recognition results in comparison with single-temporal observations; however, the improvements from adding additional timepoints became marginal after two timepoint are used with one from late spring and other from early autumn. Furthermore, prior knowledge of individual crown boundaries, typically obtained through individual tree crown delineation, is essential for efficiently incorporating phenological variations into species recognition."

 Forest productivity, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in California and the Western United States are closely tied to fire. However, fire regimes are shifting toward larger, more severe fires driven by factors such as high fuel loads and increased temperature and aridity. While multispectral satellite (e.g., Landsat) burn indices provide valuable insights into fire severity, they primarily capture top-of-canopy greenness, missing important sub-canopy changes in vegetation structure and residual fuels. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar mission provides current and consistent, near-global 3D forest structure measurements, enabling detailed assessment of forest changes from disturbances such as wildfire. This study utilized near-coincident, bitemporal pre- and post-fire GEDI on-orbit measurements to analyze structural changes across thirty-four large California wildfires (2019 to 2021). We examined twelve GEDI-based forest structure metrics representing a variety of 3D fuels properties, including forest height, low-stature fuels, biomass, canopy heterogeneity, volume and cover. Our broad goals were to: 1) assess GEDI's ability to detect structural changes in burned areas relative to control areas; and 2) in burned areas, explore relationships between forest structural change and factors such as pre-fire fuel loads, Landsat-based differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), topographic slope, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit, evapotranspiration, and time since fire. Results showed significant structural loss in all GEDI structural metrics for burned areas relative to nearby controls. Pre-fire fuel loads measured by GEDI metrics were the strongest predictors of post-fire structural change, with linear models explaining an average of 46 % of variance. Model slopes showed increasing levels of pre-fire fuels were associated with large, significant post-fire decreases in canopy structure – that is, more fuels lead to higher wildfire severity, particularly for conifer forests of the Klamath, Cascades and Sierra Nevada ecoregions. One metric, measuring the proportion of waveform energy below 10 m height, increased significantly after fire in mixed and conifer forests due to canopy opening, which enhanced lidar penetration toward the ground. In contrast, the widely-used dNBR burn severity index was less correlated with GEDI-based forest structural change than pre-fire fuels, particularly in sub-canopy fuels, with models explaining no more than 32 % of the variance (average 19 %). GEDI overcomes key limitations of airborne lidar, including high cost, limited extent, and data latency, enabling scalable and timely assessments of wildfire impacts needed to manage fuels and track forest resilience and recovery. Further, GEDI metrics are physically-based and ecologically interpretable, providing complimentary information to multispectral burn severity indices."

 Internal solitary waves (ISW) are widespread in global oceans, and satellite/in-situ observations showed that the Banda Sea has frequent ISW activities, characterized by long-wave crests, fast propagation speeds, and large amplitudes exceeding 100 m. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive ISW study in the Banda Sea to reveal ISW characteristics by collecting 417 synthetic aperture radar and optical images from 2013 to 2019. The constructed dataset comprises 134 pairs of matched satellite images and a total of 12,021 ISW propagation vectors were extracted. Satellite observation reveals that ISWs in the Banda Sea mainly originate from the Ombai Strait and propagate northward, with an average propagation speed of over 2.50 m/s and with seasonal variation of less than 20 %. To forecast ISW propagations, we developed a physics-informed neural network ISW forecast model combining the classic Eikonal Eq. (EE) and the data-driven AI algorithms following a two-step transfer learning scheme. The forecast model employs a three-hidden-layer structure with 512 nodes in each layer. Firstly, the hybrid model includes ISW physics by setting the EE as the loss function. The second step is the data-driven process, which exploits a fully connected neural network and collected ISW dataset to improve EE-based model performance by 61 % with a loss function of the mean squared error. Through the two-step training, the forecast model adopts ISW physics and also benefits from the high accuracy of the data-driven process. We randomly selected 188/118 satellite images from the built dataset to serve as the training/test dataset for the data-driven process. After the second-step training, the root mean square (average) error of the model-predicted ISW propagation time reduced from 2.59 (2.37) h to 1.01 (−0.01) h. Error analysis shows that the data-driven process can efficiently correct the systematic error in the first-step model, which stems from errors in determining the ISW source and the propagation speed distribution map. Using the developed model, we predicted the propagation time of the ISWs and compared these predictions with satellite observations and in-situ observations. The comparison showed a high degree of agreement regarding the ISWs' location and their wave crests' geometry between model predictions and satellite/in-situ observations. Key differences between the proposed model and previous models are discussed."

 The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth, placing tundra ecosystems at the forefront of global climate change. Plant biomass is a fundamental ecosystem attribute that is sensitive to changes in climate, closely tied to ecological function, and crucial for constraining ecosystem carbon dynamics. However, the amount, functional composition, and distribution of plant biomass are only coarsely quantified across the Arctic. Therefore, we developed the first moderate resolution (30 m) maps of live aboveground plant biomass (g m−2) and woody plant dominance (%) for the Arctic tundra biome, including the mountainous Oro Arctic. We modeled biomass for the year 2020 using a new synthesis dataset of field biomass harvest measurements, Landsat satellite seasonal synthetic composites, ancillary geospatial data, and machine learning models. Additionally, we quantified pixel-wise uncertainty in biomass predictions using Monte Carlo simulations and validated the models using a robust, spatially blocked and nested cross-validation procedure. Observed plant and woody plant biomass values ranged from 0 to ∼6000 g m−2 (mean ≈ 350 g m−2), while predicted values ranged from 0 to ∼4000 g m−2 (mean ≈ 275 g m−2), resulting in model validation root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) ≈ 400 g m−2 and R2 ≈ 0.6. Our maps not only capture large-scale patterns of plant biomass and woody plant dominance across the Arctic that are linked to climatic variation (e.g., thawing degree days), but also illustrate how fine-scale patterns are shaped by local surface hydrology, topography, and past disturbance. By providing data on plant biomass across Arctic tundra ecosystems at the highest resolution to date, our maps can significantly advance research and inform decision-making on topics ranging from Arctic vegetation monitoring and wildlife conservation to carbon accounting and land surface modeling."

However, challenges remain when trying to apply existing research to rural areas. Specifically, most public road datasets focus on urban areas and only contain a small number of rural scenes with complex backgrounds. The application of current public datasets for rural road extraction is challenging due to significant stylistic differences between urban and rural roads. In this article, a large-scale high-resolution remote sensing road dataset, termed WHU-RuR+, is proposed for rural road extraction, which contains 36,098 pairs of 1024 × 1024 high-resolution satellite images with the corresponding road annotation, covering a 6866.35 km2 of rural areas in eight countries around the world.

 Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) from uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) for assessing forest structures. Maximizing data completeness and representativeness is essential to accurately retrieve key structural parameters. However, knowledge on how data acquisition approaches affect canopy volume exploration is sparse. This study investigated the effects of selected sensing and flight settings on canopy occlusion in a central European forest using a cost-effective sensor system. We conducted 44 flights with a DJI Matrice 300 RTK UAV and a DJI Zenmuse L1 LiDAR sensor, with different combinations of flight speed, azimuthal flight directions, sensor tilt angles, and scan patterns. Using sensor position reconstruction and a ray tracing algorithm to quantify occlusion, we found that: (1) A larger sensor tilt angle up to 15° increased total occlusion, enhancing exploration in the upper canopy, while decreasing it below due to reduced canopy penetration. (2) Flying multiple azimuthal directions with a linear scanning mode reduced vertical occlusion by up to 15.0% due to improved coverage from diverse perspectives. (3) Lissajous scanning patterns resulted in 10.1% less vertical occlusion compared to linear patterns, underscoring the importance of additional viewing angles. Based on these findings, we recommend: (a) incorporating nadir sampling for below-canopy assessment; (b) using off-nadir angles for upper canopy evaluation; and (c) maximizing sampling perspectives and viewing angles to reduce occlusion effects. Our results offer transferable insights to optimize UAV LiDAR data acquisitions, thereby contributing to an enhanced structural metric retrieval and improved analysis of forest functional properties."

 Prenol (3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol), a second-generation biofuel, is released in the atmosphere during its use and storage where it can react with atmospheric oxidants. In this study, the ozonolysis reaction of prenol was investigated in two atmospheric simulation chambers CHARME (CHamber for the Atmospheric Reactivity and Metrology of the Environment) and THALAMOS (Thermally Regulated Atmospheric Simulation Chamber). PTR-ToF-MS and SIFT-MS were used to monitor the concentrations of organic compounds versus time. The room temperature (293 ± 2 K) rate coefficient was determined using the relative and pseudo-first order methods. The values obtained using both methods in the two chambers were in accordance, leading to an average rate coefficient of (3.26 ± 0.33) × 10−16 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. The temperature-dependent rate coefficient of this reaction was also investigated using the relative method in the temperature range 283–353 K. The following Arrhenius expression: k=(9.83±1.7)×10−16×exp(−331±53T) cm3 molecule−1 s−1 was obtained. The gas-phase oxidation products formed, at room temperature (293 ± 2 K), from this reaction were investigated using PTR-ToF-MS, SIFT-MS and GC-EI-MS analyses. Several products were identified and quantified (in %), including acetone (9 ± 2), whose formation yield was determined using a calibration standard, and acetaldehyde (30 ± 5), glycolaldehyde (30 ± 5), formaldehyde (8 ± 1), methylglyoxal (8 ± 1) and hydroxyacetone and/or methylacetate (5 ± 1) %, whose formation yields were estimated using a generic H3O+ rate coefficient for their protonation reaction. Glyoxal was also observed but not quantified. The kinetic data are compared with literature and a reaction mechanism is proposed.

 The North China Plain (NCP) experiences the most severe persistent (≥3 days) ozone pollution (POP) across China. The study investigates the POP events during the advancement of EASM using the regional climate-chemistry-ecology model RegCM-Chem-YIBs. Summers from May to August are divided into the Meiyu-flood (MYF) period, and the periods before and after. Over the past ten years, most POP events occurred in the MYF period and its preceding period, with the longest duration and highest intensity during the MYF period. A notable peak was observed in 2017, with a significant increase in POP frequency across all three monsoon periods. Process analysis and sensitivity experiments for the 2017 events were conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In the PreF period, POP events are associated with the Baikal ridge and a high-pressure system over the NCP region. Chemical reactions, vertical advection, and turbulent transport facilitate the accumulation of surface O3, while horizontal advection has a negative effect. The most severe POP events occur in the MYF period, driven by a stable and strong Baikal ridge and a relatively weak Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH). Local chemical reactions and advections contribute significantly to these events. In the PostF period, POP events are rare due to a significant decrease in solar radiation. Compared to 2016, 2017 featured a stronger and earlier-established Baikal ridge and a weaker, later-jumped WPSH, leading to an increase of 2.0–2.3 ppb hr−1 in the O3 chemical production rate during early summer. Our findings indicate that the timing of the Baikal ridge establishment and the WPSH's strength and movement significantly influence POP events over the NCP. Interannual differences in the EASM process can modulate local atmospheric circulation and determine POP frequency."

 The potential gradient variable (PG) is sensitive to several atmospheric processes. This study analyses the effect of traffic on the PG recorded at the Buenos Aires station under fair weather (FW) conditions. To identify the existence or not of an effect of traffic on the PG (FW), different statistical techniques were used. Significant differences were found in the daily means of PG (FW) between weekdays (W) and weekends (Wd), with consistent patterns throughout the year. In addition, spectral analysis revealed a significant seven-day cycle. When vehicular flow and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations were examined for both W and Wd days, they showed a variation consistent with the changes observed in PG (FW). Although aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed some changes in its daily variability, it did not show significant differences in its daily means. During the SARS-CoV-2 confinement in 2020, a decrease in PG (FW) was observed, accompanied by a decrease in vehicular flow and NO2, reinforcing the idea of the influence of these emissions on PG (FW). These results highlight the importance of considering anthropogenic effects when analysing PG (FW) in urban areas, especially in locations with low measured pollutant emissions."

 Compound dry-hot extreme events (CDHEs), as the most typical compound extreme events, bring more harm to human society than single extreme events. Traditional indicators based on stationary assumptions of hydrometeorological variables for CDHEs detection may no longer be valid due to anthropogenic and climate change impacts. The nonstationary hydrometeorological series has been extensively studied but rarely considered in identifying CDHEs. Therefore, this paper develops a nonstationary compound dry-hot index (NCDHI) with climate index and anthropogenic factors as covariates, to revisit CDHEs in China from 1961 to 2020 using the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) model. The results show that the nonstationary model is better than the traditional stationary model in fitting precipitation and temperature series. Validation using typical disaster events and losses data reveals a higher correlation between the NCDHI and actual disaster losses, confirming the good applicability of the NCDHI in China. Areas affected by CDHEs of varying severity have increased in China during the study period. Meanwhile, the severity of CDHEs has also been exacerbated, with more severe in the central and eastern regions. Furthermore, CDHEs in the western regions, though less intense, occur more frequently. The proposed NCDHI can capture the characteristics of CDHEs in China, which provides a new idea for constructing a compound dry-hot index that can effectively adapt to environmental changes. The index can further improve the scientific understanding of compound extreme events' temporal and spatial patterns and provide a scientific basis for regional risk management and disaster prevention and mitigation."

 November 2023 was marked by abnormally heavy rainfall across equatorial Central Africa, causing considerable material damage and loss of life. The present study investigates the underlying mechanisms by examining the vertical advection of moisture and moist static energy (MSE) anomalies and the net energy flux components. We find that the vertical moisture and MSE advection components are mostly induced by vertical velocity anomalies (increase of up to 5 mm/day in moisture and 80 Wm−2 in MSE) rather than by specific humidity and MSE anomalies. Additionally, mean sea level pressure and 2 m temperature are significantly larger than climatology. The increase (decrease) in the mean net long (short) wave radiation of up to 30 Wm−2 at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface favored conditions of atmospheric instability. Analysis of the net energy flux indicates positive anomalies dominated by radiative anomalies (increase of up to 30 Wm−2), mainly along the Gulf of Guinea, while in the eastern Congo Basin, a decrease (up to −27 Wm−2) in the energy balance was observed during the formation of this extreme rainfall event. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering thermodynamic processes associated with radiative effects to accurately anticipate such events. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving projections of climate extremes under the influence of global warming."

 Despite the recognized significance of wet deposition of atmospheric dissolved organic carbon (DOC), its dynamics within large reservoir catchments remain poorly understood. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variations in rainwater DOC concentrations and deposition fluxes across urban, agricultural, and reservoir areas around the Danjiangkou Reservoir in China. Volume-weighted mean (VWM) DOC concentrations varied significantly, with the highest levels observed in urban areas (7.52 mg C L−1) compared to agricultural (4.94 mg C L−1) and reservoir areas (4.66 mg C L−1). Elevated DOC concentrations occurred seasonally in spring and winter, likely due to reduced rainfall scavenging, increased heating emissions, and stable atmospheric conditions favoring pollutant accumulation. Source apportionment indicated dominant terrestrial contributions to rainwater DOC. Agricultural activities, mineral dust, and mobile emissions were associated with DOC in agricultural and reservoir areas, whereas stationary sources like coal combustion and industrial emissions contributed more to urban areas. Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified rainfall amount and electrical conductivity (EC) as significant DOC concentration predictors, reflecting atmospheric washout and terrestrial influences. Monthly DOC fluxes ranged from 0.24 to 14.12 kg C ha−1 in different sites, highlighting the temporal variability driven by precipitation. Summer witnessed the highest regional DOC deposition fluxes across all regions (16.43–25.88 kg C ha−1), over twofold higher than spring and winter. The urban area had the highest annual DOC deposition flux (56.07 kg C ha−1 yr−1), followed by the reservoir (34.77 kg C ha−1 yr−1) and agricultural areas (30.29 kg C ha−1 yr−1). Annually, atmospheric wet deposition contributes an estimated 1898 t of DOC to the reservoir, potentially enriching the upper two meters by 1.74 mg C L−1. This study enhances the understanding of DOC wet deposition dynamics in a large reservoir catchment, emphasizing the importance of considering atmospheric inputs in reservoir water quality management."

To this end, cold (≈50 K) antihydrogen will traverse a two-grid moiré deflectometer before annihilating onto a position-sensitive detector, which shall determine the vertical position of the annihilation vertex relative to the grids with micrometric accuracy. Here, we introduce a vertexing detector based on a modified mobile camera sensor and experimentally demonstrate that it can measure the position of antiproton annihilations within0.62−0.22+0.40μm, a 35-fold improvement over the previous state of the art for real-time antiproton vertexing. These methods are directly applicable to antihydrogen.

This study investigated the long-term impacts of EtOH on reward-driven decision-making and striatal neurocomputations in male and female rats using a dynamic probabilistic reversal learning task. Following a prolonged withdrawal period, EtOH-exposed male rats exhibited deficits in adaptability and exploratory behavior, with aberrant outcome-driven value updating that heightened preference for chosen action. These behavioral changes were linked to altered neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), where EtOH increased outcome-related encoding and decreased choice-related encoding. In contrast, female rats showed minimal behavioral changes with distinct EtOH-evoked alterations of neural activity, revealing significant sex differences in the impact of chronic EtOH. Our findings underscore the impact of chronic EtOH exposure on adaptive decision-making, revealing enduring changes in neurocomputational processes in the striatum underlying cognitive deficits that differ by sex."

However, the intracellular signaling pathways regulating fiber-specific muscle trophism remain unclear because of a lack of experimental models measuring protein synthesis. We developed a mouse model overexpressing a mutated transfer RNA synthetase in muscle fibers, enabling specific protein labeling using an artificial methionine substitute, which can be revealed through click chemistry. This model revealed that denervation increases protein labeling in oxidative muscle fibers through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, while deleting the mTORC1 scaffold protein Raptor reduces labeling in glycolytic fibers. On the other hand, increased muscle activity acutely decreases protein synthesis, accompanied by reduced mTORC1 signaling, glycogen depletion, and adenosine 5′-monophosphate kinase activation. Our findings identify nerve activity as an inhibitory signal for mTORC1-dependent protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, enhancing the understanding of fiber-specific responses to exercise and pathological conditions."

Leveraging data from 431,038 UK Biobank participants with 14-year follow-up, we found a significantly increased risk of depression incidence in individuals reporting pain, irrespective of body site or duration (acute or chronic), compared with pain-free individuals. The depression risk increased with the number of co-occurring pain sites. Mendelian randomization supported potential causal inference. We constructed a composite pain score by combining individual effects of acute or chronic pain conditions across eight body sites in a weighted manner. We found that depression risks increased monotonically in parallel with composite pain scores. Moreover, some inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, partially mediated the association between composite pain scores and depression risk.

Simulations ascribe this to competing zero-point energies (ZPEs): Intermolecular ZPEs stabilize hydrogen-bonds, while intramolecular ZPEs destabilize them. However, experimental validation has been lacking due to the difficulty in quantifying NQEs. The air/water interface provides an ideal platform to quantify NQEs in liquid water using surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy. By analyzing the excess/depletion of interfacial HOD, H2O, and D2O molecules with one free OH/OD group and the other H-bonded OH/OD group, we found that the intermolecular ZPE destabilizes the hydrogen-bonds by 0.74 ± 0.20 kilojoule per mole upon isotope substitution from H to D, while the intramolecular ZPE stabilizes them by 0.78 ± 0.33 kilojoule per mole.

However, this phenomenon, the superradiant phase transition (SRPT), is forbidden by a no-go theorem due to the existence of the diamagnetic term. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence for a magnonic SRPT in ErFeO3, where the role of the photonic mode (two-level atoms) in the photonic SRPT is played by an Fe3+magnon mode (Er3+spins). The absence of the diamagnetic term in the Fe3+-Er3+exchange coupling ensures that the no-go theorem does not apply. Ultrabroadband terahertz and gigahertz magnetospectroscopy experiments revealed the signatures of the SRPT in thermal equilibrium, a kink and a softening, respectively, of two spin-magnon hybridized modes at the critical point. Systems near this phase are expected to harbor large-scale squeezing, which will potentially provide a route to next-generation quantum technologies."

However, particular roles of rigid and flexible parts in layer formations remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate formation of an unprecedented superlayer cocrystal phase via a unique smectic LC phase in the equimolar melt mixture of symmetrically distinct molecules. The molecules used are a monoalkylated [(π-core)-Cn] using 2-octyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (mono-C8-BTBT) and a dialkylated [Cn-(π-core)-Cn] using 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (di-C8-BTBT). Thermal analyses show that the superlayer cocrystal is exclusively induced at the equimolar mixture via melt crystallization from the LC phase. X-ray structure analysis reveals a reversible Cn-(π-core)-Cn···(π-core)-Cnstacking arrangement in the superlayer cocrystal, where π-cores and alkyl chains form nearly independent layers. Notably, this melt crystallization allows solvent-free fabrication of semiconductive polycrystalline films for excellent thin-film transistors. These findings pave the way for tailoring a quasi–two-dimensional structure in LC materials toward molecular electronics."

The mechanisms underlying the transition from compensation to dysfunction in response to metabolic deficiency remain unclear. Here, we used spatially resolved transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on the heart of a patient with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (MCM), combined with an MCM mouse model with cardiac-specific Ndufs6 knockdown (FS6KD). Cardiomyocytes demonstrated the most heterogeneous expression landscape among cell types caused by metabolic perturbation, and pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed dynamic cellular states transitioning from compensation to severe compromise. This progression coincided with the transient up-regulation of a transcription factor,ATF3. Genetic ablation ofAtf3in FS6KD corroborated its pivotal role, effectively delaying cardiomyopathy progression in a female-specific manner. Our findings highlight a fate-determining role ofATF3in female MCM progression and that the latest transcriptomic analysis will help decipher the mechanisms underlying MD progression."

Here, we introduce a light-driven liquid crystalline network snapper that integrates both sensing and actuation capabilities, enabling adaptive responses to environmental conditions. Under constant light illumination, the snapper undergoes spontaneous snap-through transformation driven by the elastic instability embedded within the material. The snapper achieves out-of-equilibrium motion through continuous energy transfer with the environment, enabling it to sustain dynamic, reversible cycles of snapping without external control. We demonstrate the ability of the liquid crystalline network snapper to detect environmental changes—such as shifts in temperature, surface roughness, and color—demonstrating a form of embodied intelligence. This work offers a distinctive strategy for designing biomimetic devices that merge embodied intelligence with autonomous motion, opening pathways for advanced, adaptive systems for soft robotics."

Fear extinction is considered to rely mostly on neuronal function. However, whether and how astrocytes contribute to fear extinction is largely unknown. Here, we show that hippocampal CA1 astrocytes exhibit de novo Ca2+dynamics during fear extinction. Inhibition of these astrocytic Ca2+dynamics impairs, while their activation facilitates, fear extinction. In this regulation of fear extinction, the posterior basal forebrain (pBF) cholinergic input to hippocampus drives CA1 astrocytic Ca2+dynamics through the activation of α4 and α7 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Clinically used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil increases CA1 astrocytic Ca2+dynamics and facilitates fear extinction. Thus, our findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized and crucial pathway from pBF cholinergic neurons to CA1 astrocytes that governs natural fear extinction. This neuron-glia signaling pathway may constitute a promising target for treatment of fear- and anxiety-related disorders."

Oxygen plays a major role in inland-water ecosystem functioning, but long-term changes in its cycling remain unknown. Here, we quantify global inland-water oxygen production, consumption, and exchange with the atmosphere during 1900–2010 using a spatially explicit, mass-balanced, mechanistic model that takes into account changes in climate, hydrology, human activities, and the coupled biogeochemical (oxygen-nutrient-organic matter) dynamics. The model results show that global inland-water oxygen turnover increased during 1900–2010: production from 0.16 to 0.94 Pg year−1and consumption from 0.44 to 1.47 Pg year−1. Inland waters overall remained heterotrophic and a sink of atmospheric oxygen. Direct human perturbations (changes in hydrology and nutrient supply) were more important in increasing oxygen turnover than indirect effects via warming."

We generate a quantum superposition of displaced thermal states within a microwave cavity using only unitary interactions with a transmon qubit. We measure the Wigner functions of these “hot” Schrödinger cat states for an initial purity as low as 0.06. This corresponds to a cavity mode temperature of up to 1.8 kelvin, 60 times hotter than the cavity’s physical environment.

How IFT subcomplexes reach the ciliary base and assemble into IFT trains is poorly understood. Here, we perform quantitative single-molecule imaging inCaenorhabditis eleganschemosensory cilia to uncover how IFT subcomplexes arrive at the base, organize in IFT trains, and enter the cilium. We find that BBSomes reach the base via diffusion where they either associate with assembling IFT trains or with the membrane surrounding the base. In contrast, IFT-B and IFT-A reach the base via directed transport most likely on vesicles that stop at distinct locations near the base. Individual subcomplexes detach from the vesicles into a diffusive pool and associate to assembling trains. Our results show that IFT-B is first incorporated into IFT trains, followed by IFT-A, and finally BBSomes, indicating that the assembly of IFT trains is a highly regulated, step-wise process."

Further, expression profiles of the identified gene clusters suggest that both cyanobacteria populations experience simultaneous nitrogen and iron stresses in a transition zone between North Pacific oceanic gyres.

Upon mtDNA replication stress, the mitochondrial genome transfers to endosomes for degradation. Using proximity biotinylation, we found that mtDNA stress leads to the rewiring of the mitochondrial proximity proteome, increasing mitochondria’s association with lysosomal and vesicle-related proteins. Among these, the retromer complex, particularly VPS35, plays a pivotal role by extracting mitochondrial components. The retromer promotes the formation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles shuttled to lysosomes. The mtDNA, however, directly shuttles to a recycling organelle in a BAX-dependent manner. Moreover, using aDrosophilamodel carrying a long deletion on the mtDNA (ΔmtDNA), we found that ΔmtDNA activates a specific transcriptome profile to counteract mitochondrial damage. Here,Vps35expression restores mtDNA homoplasmy and alleviates associated defects. Hence, we demonstrate the existence of a previously unknown quality control mechanism for the mitochondrial matrix and the essential role of lysosomes in mtDNA turnover to relieve mtDNA damage."

Previous research has provided several interpretations of this attraction, including potential drug abuse, or a self-medicating coping strategy after mate rejection. We posit that the ecologically adaptive value of alcohol attraction has not been fully explored. Here, we assert a simple yet vital biological rationale for this alcohol preference. Flies display attraction to fruits rich in alcohol, specifically ethanol and methanol, where contact results in a rapid amplification of fatty acid–derived pheromones that enhance courtship success. We also identify olfactory sensory neurons that detect these alcohols, where we reveal roles in both attraction and aversion, and show that valence is balanced around alcohol concentration. Moreover, we demonstrate that methanol can be deadly, and adult flies must therefore accurately weigh the trade-off between benefits and costs for exposure within their naturally fermented and alcohol-rich environments."

The apo TolQ configuration manifests as a symmetric pentameric pore, featuring a transmembrane funnel leading toward a cytoplasmic chamber. In contrast, the TolQ-TolR complex assumes a proton nonpermeable stance, characterized by the TolQ pentamer’s flexure to accommodate the TolR dimer, where two protomers undergo a translation-based relationship. Our structure-guided analysis and simulations support the rotor-stator mechanism of action, wherein the rotation of the TolQ pentamer harmonizes with the TolR protomers’ interplay.

Chiral SHG is found to be proportional to spin chirality and spin-canting-induced electric polarization, while intrinsic MSHG is proportional to the Néel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we reveal a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin-canting direction, generating a giant modulation of SHG signals. Our work not only uncovers a unique SHG with exceptional tunability but also promotes the applications of AFM optical devices and magnetoelectric detection techniques."

Wetter conditions in the early-to-mid Holocene coincide with the African Humid Period, whereas the most severe summer droughts of the past 9000 years are found during the Little Ice Age in the 18th and 19th centuries Common Era.
