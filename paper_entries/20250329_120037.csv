10.1088/1748-9326/adb765,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是通过通货膨胀减少法案（IRA）推动能源效率改造，以实现住宅和商业建筑的脱碳。论文评估了IRA对不同收入群体采用空气源热泵、热泵热水器、热泵干衣机和电炊具的影响。研究发现，IRA的补贴显著提高了低收入家庭采用这些技术的潜力，甚至超过了中高收入家庭。论文重点在于能源政策、经济影响和能源效率改造，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Jordan M Joseph;Constantine Samaras;Destenie Nock;Kelvin B Gregory;Parth Vaishnav,Rebates and grid decarbonization from the inflation reduction act promote equitable adoption of energy efficiency retrofits,"Residential and commercial buildings account for 75% of electricity and 40% of the total energy consumption in the United States, costing over $400 billion annually. Electrification and energy efficiency retrofits offer a viable decarbonization pathway, especially since half of US homes were built before modern building codes. These older homes are often occupied by low-to-moderate-income (LMI) families. Equitable electrification provides a unique opportunity to considerably reduce emissions in communities where energy bill savings have the most impact on household finances. This study evaluates how the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) impacts the adoption potential of air-source heat pumps (ASHPs), heat pump water heaters and clothes dryers, and electric cooking ranges across income groups in the United States. Using a database that statistically represents the US housing stock, we estimate the indicative adoption potential of these technologies under scenarios that represent Pre-IRA conditions and a reference case with IRA provisions. After IRA rebates were introduced, adoption potential for LMI households more than doubled for ASHPs, heat pump water heaters, and electric cooking ranges and more than tripled for heat pump clothes dryers relative to Pre-IRA adoption potential. Cooking retrofits had the lowest adoption potential, and homes that electrified space heating without weatherization had greater adoption potential than those that underwent basic or enhanced enclosure upgrades. Our results show that the introduction of IRA rebates and a gradually decarbonizing grid substantially improves adoption potential for LMI households and even surpasses the adoption potential of middle and upper-income households."

Internal climate variability combines with the forced global warming response to determine both the magnitude and spatial distribution of these events, and their consequences can propagate from one country to another via many pathways. We examine how exposure to compound climate hazards in one country is transmitted internationally via agricultural trade networks by analyzing a large ensemble of climate model simulations and comprehensive trade data of four crops (i.e. wheat, maize, rice and soya). Combinations of variability-driven climate patterns and existing global agricultural trade give rise to a wide range of possible outcomes in the current climate. In the most extreme simulated year, 20% or more of the caloric supply in nearly one third of the world’s countries are exposed to compound heat and precipitation hazards. Countries with low levels of diversification, both in the number of suppliers and the regional climates of those suppliers, are more likely to import higher fractions of calories (up to 93%) that are exposed to these compound hazards. Understanding how calories exposed to climate hazards are transmitted through agricultural trade networks in the current climate can contribute to improved anticipatory capacity for national governments, international trade policy, and agricultural-sector resilience. Our results highlight the need for concerted effort toward merging cutting-edge seasonal-to-decadal climate prediction with international trade analysis in support of a new era of anticipatory Anthropocene risk management."

However, the role of mid-latitude atmospheric circulation anomalies in resulting winter BKS warming is unclear. This study investigates the relationship between autumn (October–November) East Asian trough (EAT) and the BKS warming in the subsequent winter (December–February) for the period 1979–2022. The result shows that when the autumn EAT weakens, warming, increased moisture, and sea ice loss are observed in the BKS during winter. The weakened EAT promotes increased sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the mid-latitude North Pacific through increasing solar radiation and reducing cold air activity and positive SST anomalies persist into winter. These continuous warm SSTs from autumn to winter trigger winter Rossby waves downstream, which favors the occurrence of a combination of a positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation and high pressure over the Ural region, further leading to BKS warming."

The assessment of the modelling tools for blue-green elements (BGEs) documents that currently there is no process-based model for the simultaneous evaluation and optimisation of multiple ecosystem services of BGEs. To evaluate coupling options, this study conducted a meta-analysis on model interoperability by assessing the model scales, drivers, overlaps, gaps, and interfaces of these models for BGEs. Model meta-analysis points out the conceptual and constructual constraints preventing easy model coupling, and thus, an integrated assessment of ecosystem services. Constraints arise due to very different disciplinary approaches from different scientific communities involved in model development, differences in the simulation of transformation and transport processes at urban interfaces relevant for BGEs, and fundamental divergences in spatial and temporal scales and time steps of existing models for single ecosystem services. In particular, the lack of vegetation models tailored for BGEs hinders current model developments towards developing a process-based tool for multiple ecosystem services, which would be able to handle nonstationary climate conditions, including feedback assessments of drought and heatwave impacts on the functioning of BGEs."

At greater levels of wind deployment, the increased likelihood of extended periods of generation surplus and deficit presents a challenge for managing power supply. It is essential to characterise and predict how this energy source performs within India’s monsoon climate to ensure the reliable operation of the electricity system. This study demonstrates, for the first time, how large-scale atmospheric variables are related to seasonal wind energy generation anomalies in India during boreal summer. Furthermore, an operational seasonal forecasting system is shown to skilfully predict the atmospheric predictor variables at a lead time of 1–4 months, indicating an ability to forecast summer wind energy generation at the country and regional level in India. The explanatory power of the chosen atmospheric predictor variables remains high under the near-term planned expansion of the Indian wind fleet. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of seasonal forecast information for electricity system management in India."

We explore the role of Arctic sea ice loss, a key driver of AA, in changing cold temperature extremes across Canada and their impact on human mortality. We use a multi-model ensemble of climate simulations from the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project and a distributed lag nonlinear mortality model in 27 regions covering Canada to quantify the role of Arctic sea ice loss in changing human mortality in the cold season. We find that despite a robust increase in 5th percentile temperatures across eastern Canada, there is no detectable decrease in mortality associated with the most extreme cold, due to mortality in many regions having low sensitivity to warming of cold extremes. The study attributes the temperature-related mortality impact of a physical process, namely Arctic sea ice loss, and highlights Canada’s robust adaptation to extreme cold."

According to wind data, these episodes came from the direction of the industrial park and often correlated with increased symptom and odor reports. Additionally, metals biomarker toenail sampling revealed elevated nickel levels in a subset of resident children, which is an industrial pollutant of concern in this community.

Transport is the only sector with rising emissions, with an increase of 24% compared to 1990. The EU initially aimed to ban new CO2-emitting cars by 2030 but has since delayed this target to 2035, underscoring the ongoing challenges in the push for rapid decarbonisation. The pace of decarbonisation in this sector will either ease or intensify the pressure on other sectors to stay within the EU’s carbon budget. This paper explores the effects of speeding up or slowing down the transition in road transport. We reveal that a slower decarbonisation path not only drives up system costs by 126 billion €/a (6%) but also demands more than a doubling of the CO2 price from 137 to 290 €/t in 2030 to trigger decarbonisation in other sectors. On the flip side, accelerating the shift to cleaner transport proves to be the most cost-effective strategy, giving room for more gradual changes in the heating and industrial sectors, while reducing the reliance on carbon removal in later years. Earlier mandates than currently envisaged by the EU can avoid stranded assets and save up to 43 billion €/a compared to current policies."

Yet, our understanding of the compound impact of soil and environmental factors on SOC gain potential after transitioning to no-till practices is still developing. Using imbalanced machine learning classification, here we quantify key thresholds to hierarchically classify SOC gain potential by switching from conventional tillage to long-term no-tillage with residue retention. Our findings reveal that antecedent SOC level exerts the primary influence, with a reduced gain potential for antecedent SOC exceeding 50 tonnes per hectare. Wet climate (Dryness Index 1.5) and low productivity (net annual primary productivity 5.5 tonnes per hectare) could further lessen the effectiveness of SOC sequestration. These key thresholds identify vast areas across Africa, Australia, South Asia, Southern Europe, and parts of North and South America as high-potential croplands for carbon sequestration and offer guidelines for assessing the reliability of regenerative agriculture in local and regional contexts."

The findings enhance our understanding of nighttime biomass burning evolution and its implications for climate and regional air quality, especially regarding interactions with background aerosol water and water-rich fogs and clouds. 
 Biomass burning is a major global source of both primary brown carbon (BrC) and reactive trace gases in the atmosphere and thus has a significant impact on global climate and regional atmospheric chemistry. However, a substantial gap remains in our understanding of the nighttime evolution of biomass burning emissions. Here we present prominent nighttime formation of secondary organic aerosol (Night-OA) with strong absorptivity but markedly different spectral dependence from that of primary biomass burning organic aerosols, which was observed during autumn in the Pearl River Delta region of China when biomass burning plumes prevailed. Our results demonstrate that the formation of Night-OA appeared to have high dependence on both the magnitudes of biomass burning emissions at nightfall and available oxidants of NO2 and O3. Active nighttime NO3 radical chemistry was characterized by quick O3 depletion and almost zero concentration of NO. The rapid decrease in NO2 coincident with the quick nitrate formation suggests that the rapid NO2 consumption supplied the NO3 and N2O5 reaction chains. However, the quickest Night-OA formation occurred when nitrate formation ceased and relative humidity reached maximum, and it mainly added mass to aerosol water-abundant diameter ranges. This co-variation suggests that gas-phase reactions of biomass burning precursors, along with aqueous-phase chemistry involving preexisting hygroscopic aerosols in the diluted plume, likely work in concert to promote the rapid nighttime formation of Night-OA. Preexisting background aerosols are generally much more hygroscopic than the aerosols directly emitted from biomass burning. Incorporating the important role of background aerosols in the aging of diluted biomass burning plumes would be valuable in future laboratory and model simulation studies. The proposed mechanisms for secondary BrC formation have broad implications for the climate and air quality impacts of biomass burning, including the interaction between biomass burning plumes and background aerosols in humid regions, as well as with water-abundant pyroconvection clouds."

Based on multi-site spectroscopic measurements, this study demonstrated the significant spatial heterogeneity in the optical and structural properties of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in different regions of China and revealed factors affecting WSOC light absorption and the relationship between fluorophores and light absorption of WSOC. 
 To understand the spatial variation of optical and structural properties of water-soluble brown carbon and its influencing factors in China, the light absorption, fluorescence, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in different regions of China are measured following the same analytical methods. The average light absorption coefficients and mass absorption efficiencies of WSOC at 365 nm (Abs365 and MAE365) rank from high to low as northwest China > southwest China > north China > east China > regional site, with higher values in northern China than southern China and regional sites and higher values in inland areas than coastal areas. The light absorption factors resolved by light absorption spectra-based positive matrix factorization model and the abundance of aromatic O−H and C=C functional groups determined by FTIR both indicate that aromatic compounds are significant light-absorbing substances in WSOC and have a significant impact on fluorophores. Multiple linear regression analysis shows that the fluorophores identified by fluorescence spectra combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) contribute to about 62 %–93 % of the WSOC light absorption at all sites, in which humic-like substance (HULIS) contributes the most, especially highly oxygenated HULIS (29 %–50 %) with long emission wavelengths. Combustion source emissions and atmospheric chemical processes have significant impacts on the WSOC light absorption at some sites. Moreover, relative humidity (RH) can also affect MAE365 of WSOC, with MAE365 values decreasing with the increase in RH when RH<60 % and remaining relatively unchanged when RH>60 %. Taken together, this study promotes a better understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of optical and structural properties of WSOC and their influencing factors in China."

Our study demonstrates the potential of high-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) satellite to estimate ground-level PM concentrations using machine learning models. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is the world's first ultraviolet–visible instrument for air quality monitoring in geostationary orbit. Since its launch in 2020, GEMS has provided hourly daytime air quality information over Asia. However, to date, validation and applications of these data are largely lacking. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of the first 2 years of GEMS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data in estimating ground-level particulate matter (PM) concentrations at an hourly scale. To do so, we train random forest and XGBoost machine learning algorithms using GEMS AOD data and meteorological variables as input features, then employ the trained models to estimate PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in South Korea. The model-estimated PM concentrations capture the spatial and temporal variations observed in ground-based measurements well, showing strong correlations. However, they exhibit noticeable biases at the extremes, with a tendency to overestimate concentrations at lower PM levels and underestimate them at higher PM levels. Incorporating locally available data, such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide measurements, into the model training further enhances performance, improving correlations and reducing errors. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning models with neighbouring station data to estimate PM concentrations at ungauged locations where ground PM measurements are not available. Our results will serve as a reference to aid the evaluation of future GEMS AOD retrieval algorithm improvements and also provide initial guidance for data users."

However, many global ET datasets overlook soil moisture constraints, causing large uncertainties. In this study, we developed an improved model that better captures the influence of soil moisture on vegetation and soil evaporation. Our model significantly improves ET estimation accuracy and provides a new long-term global ET dataset to support water cycle and climate research. 
 Accurately quantifying the impact of soil water availability on evapotranspiration (ET) is curcial for improving ET retrieval accuracy. However, most global satellite-derived ET datasets do not explicitly incorporate soil moisture constraints, leading to significant uncertainties, particularly in water-limited regions. In this study, we propose an enhanced soil moisture constraint scheme that effectively captures soil moisture’s influence on vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation using a quantile-based approach. Unlike previous methods, this scheme relies solely on soil moisture data, reducing uncertainties associated with heterogeneous soil hydraulic properties. We integrated this approach into the process-based land surface ET/heat fluxes algorithm (P-LSH, or P-LSHv1), developing an improved version, P-LSHv2. Using observations from 106 global flux towers, we calibrated biome- and climate-specific parameters and quantified moisture constraints across diverse climates and land cover types. P-LSHv2 achieves notable improvements in ET estimation, with a reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.67 mm d-1; and an increased correlation coefficient (R) of 0.81, outperforming its predecessor, P-LSHv1, particularly in arid regions. Comparative analyses show that P-LSHv2 surpasses the Penman-Monteith-Leuning model and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model in capturing soil moisture anomalies' effects on ET, enhancing global ET accuracy. Leveraging the P-LSHv2 algorithm, we have produced a long-term global daily ET dataset spanning 1982–2023, providing a valuable resource for research on terrestrial water and energy cycles and climate change.

The PhenoCam Network characterizes vegetation phenology in ecosystems across the US and around the world using repeat digital photography. This V3.0 release includes new additions to the data records (e.g., camera NDVI and simplified data sets) and provides >4800 site years of phenological time series and transition dates, a 170% increase relative to the previous data release (V2.0). Over 450 of the time series are 5 y or longer in length. 
 Vegetation phenology plays a significant role in driving seasonal patterns in land-atmosphere interactions and ecosystem productivity, and is a key factor to consider when modeling or investigating ecological and land-surface dynamics. To integrate phenology in ecological research ultimately requires the application of carefully curated and quality controlled phenological datasets that span multiple years and include a wide range of different ecosystems and plant functional types. By using digital cameras to record images of plant canopies every 30 minutes, pixel-level information from the visible red-green-blue color channels can be quantified to evaluate canopy greenness (defined as the green chromatic coordinate, GCC), and how it varies in space and time. These phenological cameras (i.e., “PhenoCams”) offer a pragmatic and effective way to measure and provide phenology data for both research and education. Here, in this dataset descriptor, we present the PhenoCam dataset version 3 (V3.0), providing significant updates relative to prior releases. PhenoCam V3.0 includes 738 unique sites and a total of 4805.5 site years, a 170 % increase relative to PhenoCam V2.0 (1783 site years), with notable expansion of network coverage for evergreen broadleaf forests, understory vegetation, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural systems. Furthermore, in this updated release, we now include a PhenoCam-based estimate of the normalized difference vegetation index (cameraNDVI), calculated from back-to-back visible and visible+near-infrared images acquired from approximately 75 % of cameras in the network, which utilize a sliding infrared cut filter. Both GCC and cameraNDVI showed similar, but somewhat unique, patterns in canopy greenness and VIS vs. NIR reflectance, across various ecosystems, indicating their consistent ability to record phenological variability. However, we did find that at most sites, GCC time series had less variability and fewer outliers, representing a smoother signal of canopy greenness and phenology. Overall, PhenoCam greenness as measured by both GCC and cameraNDVI provides expanded opportunities for studying phenology and tracking ecological changes, with potential applications to the evaluation of satellite data products, earth system and ecosystem modeling, and understanding phenologically mediated ecosystem processes.

Conventional remediation agents are often carried away by groundwater flow in high-permeability layers, making it difficult to access NAPL contaminants in low-permeability layers and are prone to generate secondary contamination. This study explores the use of dihydrolevoclucosenone (Cyrene), a bioderived green solvent, as an alternative to traditional remediating agents for NAPL remediation. Through microfluidic experiments and accompanying numerical modeling, we demonstrate that Cyrene enhances the dissolution and mobilization of NAPL contaminants, particularly in low-permeability zones, achieving residual NAPL reductions of up to 80% compared with water and Tween 80 solutions. These findings underscore Cyrene’s dual environmental benefits as an eco-friendly solvent for both treating solid waste (e.g., stalks) and for NAPL remediation, paving the way for sustainable and green solutions in environmental management."

Despite the well-known climate benefits, practical implementation is often hampered by conflicts between environmental goals and farmers’ economic interests. Identifying optimal rewetting locations that maximize greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction while minimizing agricultural disruption is crucial to advancing this process. However, there is currently limited scientific evidence to guide these decisions. To identify “low-hanging fruits”, 12 sites were selected for 4-month incubations to investigate the effects of four land uses (grass-cut, grass-graze, arable, and unmanaged) on CO2 and methane (CH4) emissions postrewetting. Results showed that unmanaged sites exhibited the highest potential for GHG reduction (2015 mg CO2-eq m–2 day–1, 89.9%), followed by grass-graze, grass-cut, and arable sites, reflecting a gradient of management intensity. These insights suggest that prioritizing rewetting of unmanaged areas while delaying interventions on arable lands could yield greater climate benefits and enhance farmers’ acceptance. Additionally, emission variability across sites was linked to soil properties, indicating that soils with a higher organic carbon content (for greater CO2 reduction) and lower bacterial diversity (for reduced CH4 production) offer the greatest GHG reduction potential. This study provides crucial scientific evidence to guide targeted peatland rewetting efforts, supporting net-zero emission goals."

Bioaerosols are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, but little is known about their photochemical behavior and contributions to atmospheric photochemistry. We investigated the photochemical behavior of aqueous-phase cellular organic matter (COM) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from cultured bacteria isolated from atmospheric PM2.5, focusing on their photochemical production of 3C*, 1O2*, and •OH. The molecular size and aromaticity of chromophores and fluorophores in COM and EPS increased with molecular weight (MW). Apparent quantum yields (ΦRI) of up to 10% and 5% were measured for 1O2* and 3C*, respectively, which are in the upper range of previously reported values. This indicated that COM and EPS contain photosensitizers that are highly efficient at producing 1O2* and 3C*. ΦRI and concentrations ([RI]ss) decreased with MW due to higher-MW molecules engaging in charge-transfer interactions that disrupt photochemical processes and oxidant production. Machine learning models were used to understand and predict oxidant production based on measurable optical and chemical properties of COM and EPS.

Among the contaminants of concern are polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), a toxic group of organic pollutants prevalent at high concentrations in bitumen. Here, we quantify PAC concentrations, loads, and yields in four rivers draining watersheds impacted by mining. These rivers also actively erode and incise the bitumen-bearing McMurray Formation, which has complicated previous attempts to distinguish natural from anthropogenic inputs. We collected 998 water quality samples from locations both upstream and downstream of mining, analyzed them for a broad suite of 48 unsubstituted and alkylated PAC homologues, and compared their compositional fingerprints to potential natural and anthropogenic sources. Erosion of bituminous outcrops, rather than industrial pollution, is the main driver behind PAC input and riverine transport, as supported by (i) discrepancies in loads and yields among watersheds with varying levels of industrial development, (ii) responses to hydrologic changes with respect to the distribution of mapped outcrops, and (iii) shifts in PAC relative abundances. This study presents evidence that PAC concentrations are primarily controlled by the presence of eroding bitumen-rich outcrops in conjunction with hydrographic profiles, rather than industrial impacts."

Inspired by selective ion uptake processes in mangroves, we propose the strategy, fabricating ultrashort, vertically aligned channels for Li+ transport in the electrode to enhance the Li+ selective performance of HCDI. The self-supporting graphene/LMO/bacterial cellulose electrode featuring vertically aligned channels (VGLB) possesses sturdy framework, excellent electrical conductivity, fast electron/ion transport channels, and abundant available Li+ adsorption sites, enabling an ultrahigh Li+ adsorption rate of 2.6 mg g–1 min–1 and capacity up to 33.9 mg g–1 with a high retention of 91.62% after 100 cycles. VGLB also manifests superior selectivity in various simulated salt lake brines with Li+ purity in recovered solution of over 85%. Most importantly, VGLB enables selective Li+ extraction in low-grade brine from Jingbian oil and gas-produced water. We conduct finite element simulations to study the Li+ distribution in the electrode and disclose how the electrode microstructure influences the Li+ extraction performance.

To better understand climate impacts of forest bioenergy use, we develop a comprehensive framework for assessing the dynamic lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for bioenergy projects using pine pulpwood feedstocks from managed forests in the U.S. South. We apply it in eight different forest basins to determine the carbon payback period and cumulative carbon storage for hypothetical bioenergy projects with 30-year plant operating lives (2030–2060). Variations in local forest types, age class distributions, and traditional wood product market demands result in large differences in carbon payback times between basins. In general, carbon debt repayment is faster for biofuel or bioelectricity projects that employ CCS than those that do not. We find that facilities employing CCS and consuming 3 million green tons of feedstock annually yield carbon payback periods below 10 years if located within pine-dominated coastal plain or gulf coast regions.

However, a lack of efficient means and incomplete monitoring data are the main obstacles impeding soil pollution management and prevention in China. Moreover, it is rare to examine the possibility and reliability of using  field-collected earthworms to assess the pollution degree of soil heavy metals in real-world situations at a large field scale. In this study, we investigate the potential use of field-collected earthworms as bio-indicators to assess the pollution characteristics and risks of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cd, and Cr) across three typical regions (Xiaokeng Reservoir, Dabaoshan Mine, and Smelter/Steel Plants) in Shaoguan, one of six trial zones identified for the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in China. Our results unveil the existence of significant differences in the spatial distribution and bioavailability of heavy metals in soils and earthworms across these regions. The average contents of Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cr, and Cd in soils were 329.7 ± 476.5, 180.9 ± 262.4, 82.9 ± 197.8, 66.6 ± 61.6, 53.3 ± 53.6, and 7.2 ± 8.2 mg/kg, while those in earthworms were 113.6 ± 112.1, 99.4 ± 106.8, 90.0 ± 126.9, 24.7 ± 30.8, 8.8 ± 9.4, and 5.1 ± 3.4 mg/kg, respectively. The internal exposure dose of heavy metals in earthworms is found to more accurately reflect their bioavailability under true environmental conditions than the external exposure dose in soils. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) exhibited the highest values for Cd (0.01–24.40), followed by those for Pb (0.06–9.94), Cu (0.12–5.23), Cr (0.02–1.90), As (0.02–1.18), and Zn (0.06–1.17). Further principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest (RF) classification ascertain that earthworms are more capable of differentiating heavy metal pollution in different regions than soil alone. Compared to the routine analysis of the total heavy metal content in soils, our novel strategy demonstrates the superiority of employing field-collected earthworms as bio-indicators for monitoring heavy metal pollution and discriminating potential sources of soil pollution in a real scenario."

This study examines the association between temperature and suicide in Thailand’s tropical climate, focusing on Chiang Mai and Bangkok provinces, and quantifies the attributable burden. Daily suicide and meteorological data from 2002 to 2021 were analyzed using a time-stratified case-crossover approach with a distributed lag nonlinear model, adjusted for relative humidity. Province-specific estimates were pooled through a multivariate meta-regression model. The study found a positive, mostly linear association between temperature and suicide risk, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.35, 2.15) across the temperature range. Approximately 24.61% of suicides were attributable to temperature, with 12.05% due to hot temperatures above the 66th percentile. The pooled attributable fractions were higher in the 0–64 age group compared to those aged ≥65, while differences between sexes were not statistically significant. This study highlights the significant association between higher ambient temperatures and increased suicide risks in Thailand, emphasizing the need to integrate climate considerations into mental health and suicide prevention policies.

While MPs can be ingested, breathed in, or drank in, a very direct entrance channel is available through ingress into the bloodstream. Intravenous infusion usually proceeds from plastic bottles. Many are made of polypropylene (PP), and filtering is applied to limit particle contamination. In this study, we examined the MPs’ content of filtrates using a combination of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. We find that the number of PP particles is significant (∼7500 particles/L). The MP sizes range from 1 to 62 μm, with a median of ∼8.5 μm. About 90% of particles ranged between 1 and 20 μm in size, with ∼60% in the range 1 to 10 μm. We then discuss the potential number of such particles injected and the consequences of their presence in the bloodstream. We highlight the organs for potential deposition, and we discuss possible clinical effects. Our quantitative data are important to help evaluate the toxicity risks associated with MPs and to accurately balance those risks versus the benefits of using intravenous injections."

To understand that, we studied participants from two representative towns in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, China. Lung function parameters (FVC%, FEV1%, and FEV1/FVC) were measured, while PFAS concentrations in urine and indoor dust were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We measured the levels of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α (8-epi-PGF2α), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in urine. The results demonstrated a preponderance of short-chain PFAS in urine, with PFBS, PFPeA, and PFBA showing the highest detection rates. PFBA had the highest median concentration at 0.47 ng/mL. Similarly, in indoor dust, PFBA was the most frequently detected, followed by PFOA, with median concentrations of 0.56 and 0.44 ng/g, respectively. Multiple PFAS compounds showed significant inverse correlations with FVC% and FEV1%. PFAS exposure was associated with elevated oxidative stress biomarker levels (8-OHdG, 8-epi-PGF2α, and MDA), and their synergistic interaction aggravated the decline in lung function.

This study investigates the chronic (60 days) hepatotoxic effects and the underlying mechanism of 4-tBP on fish, including concentrations with environmental relevance (≤100 μg/L), using Cyprinus carpio L. as the model. Results showed that 1–500 μg/L 4-tBP triggered significant alterations in oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA)) and liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), with a dose–response relationship confirmed by the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) index. Histopathological analysis and molecular experiments revealed inflammatory responses, disruptions in glycogen metabolism, and critical insulin signaling pathways (IRS1, AKT, and GSK3β). Further investigations, including miRNA sequencing and in vitro assays in primary hepatocytes, identified the miR-363/PKCδ axis as a critical regulatory pathway affecting these changes.

As a substitute for PFOS, sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS) is extensively utilized in various applications and detected in human blood. However, its potential health risk in AS remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the comparative impacts of PFOS and OBS on endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. In the in vivo study, Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE–/–) mice were exposed to 0.4 or 4 mg/L PFOS/OBS for 12 weeks. We found that dyslipidemia developed more rapidly in the OBS-exposed mice than in the PFOS-exposed mice. PFOS exhibited a higher enrichment capacity in both blood and aortic tissues than OBS. Remarkably, OBS induced a more pronounced inflammatory response and caused a more significant disruption of the endothelial barrier in the aorta of ApoE–/– mice compared to PFOS. In vitro experiments showed that OBS, at the same exposure concentrations and durations as PFOS (0.1–20 μmol/L, 48 h), more effectively inhibited cell viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), caused higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and enhanced cell adhesion between HUVECs and monocytes. Both PFOS and OBS were found to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and upregulate the expression of inflammatory factors. Notably, the use of OBS, but not PFOS, was shown to disrupt cell junctions and increase endothelial permeability by activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that OBS may lead to endothelial dysfunction and have a greater impact on AS compared to PFOS, presenting significant health risks in cardiovascular diseases."

The RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was utilized to analyze cytokine levels as well as proteomic and metabolomic changes. In the quantitative real-time PCR experiments, the DON group showed significant difference compared to the control group (* p < 0.05) and the DON-OG group (# p < 0.05) regarding cytokine levels such as IL-10, TNF-α, Il6, Il1b, Ccl2, Il12α, Nos2, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2. In the animal experiment, C57BL/6 mice were utilized to monitor body weight, the presence of bloody stools, and diarrhea. Additionally, the colonic tissues of the mice underwent pathological analysis. The results indicated that cells treated with both DON and OG displayed lower levels of inflammation compared to those treated with DON alone. Furthermore, proteomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that the regulation of the Lancl2 protein and the mTOR signaling pathway contributed to the milder inflammatory response observed in the DON-OG group. These findings were further corroborated by the pathological analysis of the colonic tissues from the mice.

Among them, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium (M8OI) has been detected at high concentrations in soils and exhibits hepatotoxic properties. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying this toxicity, whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed, coupled with benchmark dose (BMD) modeling, to derive transcriptomic points-of-departure (tPOD) through dose–response analysis. The transcriptomic analysis identified 425, 667, and 567 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following low (10 μmol/L), medium (50 μmol/L), and high (200 μmol/L) doses of M8OI exposure, respectively. Enrichment analysis revealed significant perturbations in pathways related to cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and IL-17 signaling. BMD modeling yielded tPOD values of 1.51 μmol/L (median of the 20 most sensitive genes, omicBMD20), 2.98 μmol/L (tenth percentile of all genes, omicBMD10th), 6.83 μmol/L (mode of the first peak of all gene BMDs, omicBMDmode), and 5.9 μmol/L for pathway-level analysis. These transcriptomics-derived tPODs were at least 105-fold lower than M8OI’s hepatotoxic concentration, as indicated by its EC50 of 723.6 μmol/L in HepG2 cells. Functional analysis of the transcriptomic data identified legionellosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer as the most sensitive pathways affected by M8OI. These findings highlight the molecular mechanisms driving M8OI-induced hepatotoxicity and underscore the utility of transcriptomics in deriving sensitive and quantitative toxicity thresholds. The results provide critical insights for guideline-driven toxicological evaluations and regulatory decision-making, supporting a more comprehensive assessment of IL safety."

 Deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining is currently in the exploration phase with some groups proposing a move towards extraction within years1. Management of this industry requires evidence of the long-term effects on deep-sea ecosystems2, but the ability of seafloor ecosystems to recover from impacts over decadal scales is poorly understood3. Here we show that, four decades after a test mining experiment that removed nodules, the biological impacts in many groups of organisms are persistent, although populations of several organisms, including sediment macrofauna, mobile deposit feeders and even large-sized sessile fauna, have begun to re-establish despite persistent physical changes at the seafloor. We also reveal that areas affected by plumes from this small-scale test have limited detectable residual sedimentation impacts with some biological assemblages similar in abundance compared to control areas after 44 years. Although some aspects of the modern collector design may cause reduced physical impact compared to this test mining experiment, our results show that mining impacts in the abyssal ocean will be persistent over at least decadal timeframes and communities will remain altered in directly disturbed areas, despite some recolonisation. The long-term effects seen in our study provide critical data for effective management of mining activities, if they occur, including minimising direct impacts and setting aside an effective network of protected areas4,5."

 Aquatic vegetation contributes to lake methane emissions, but changes in aquatic vegetation in northern (>40° N) lakes remain unknown, hindering evaluations of its importance in estimating lake emissions. Here we use Landsat imagery to monitor aquatic vegetation (mainly emergent and floating vegetation) in 2.7 million northern lakes from 1984 to 2021. Vegetation was observed in 1.2 million lakes, with a total maximum vegetation area of 12.0 × 104 km2, a mean vegetation occurrence of 1.68 ± 3.8% and a greenness of 0.66 ± 0.05. From the 1980s–1990s to 2010s, significant (P < 0.05) increases in maximum vegetation area (+2.3 × 104 km2) and vegetation occurrence (+73.7%) were observed and 72.5% of lakes experienced higher greenness. Vegetation expansion was affected by the temperature in sparsely populated regions, whereas lake area and fertilizer usage played vital roles in densely populated areas. The methane emission estimate that includes contributions from both aquatic vegetation and open water (1.31 [0.73, 1.89] Tg CH4 yr−1) is 13% higher than that calculated for open water (1.16 [0.63, 1.68] Tg CH4 yr−1). The long-term net increase in total methane emissions including aquatic vegetation is 125% higher than that of open water due to vegetation expansion. This highlights the necessity of incorporating aquatic vegetation in estimates of methane emissions from northern lakes.

 Flow laws for ice predict rates of deformation (strain) and are fundamental to modelling glacier and ice-sheet dynamics. Here we apply Bayesian inference to laboratory measurements accumulated over 70 years to constrain flow laws for ice-sheet modelling. At low strains, commonly used flow laws—derived from individual experimental datasets with narrow stress, temperature and grain-size ranges—fail to capture the full complexity of ice behaviour. We show that a multicomponent flow law that sums strain rates from different deformation mechanisms is needed to capture grain-size and temperature sensitivities observed in the full set of experiments. This multicomponent flow law is applicable to natural scenarios where the anisotropy of ice is weak or where the deformation kinematics differ from those that formed the crystallographic preferred orientation, making the ice more viscous. Low-strain flow laws, including this multicomponent flow law, have limited validity at high strain, where viscosity evolves and anisotropy develops, making ice less viscous. A one-component, grain-size insensitive flow law gives a reasonable fit to high-strain experimental data and is better suited to modelling the large-scale flow behaviour of ice sheets. Experimentally constrained flow laws predict ice-sheet strain rates that differ by an order of magnitude from estimates made using previous flow laws, highlighting the need for accurate flow laws in ice-sheet modelling."

 Continental cratons are characterized by thick lithospheric roots that remain intact for billions of years. However, some cratonic roots appear to have been thinned or completely removed in the geological past. The mechanisms for thinning have been difficult to distinguish for these past events. Here we present a full-waveform seismic tomographic model for North America that allows the resolution of fine-scale structures and reveals an extensive craton-thinning event that is ongoing. The seismic images show extensive drip-like features that suggest the transport of lithospheric materials from the base of the craton beneath the central United States to the mantle transition zone, and thus active lithospheric thinning. Geodynamic modelling suggests that the dripping may be mobilized by large-scale mantle flow induced by the sinking of the Farallon slab that is currently in the lower mantle. Dripping lithosphere could be further facilitated by prior lithospheric weakening, for example by volatiles released from the slab. Our seismological observations of active extensive thinning of cratonic lithosphere support lithospheric removal could be a result of external mantle processes, which we hypothesize may include the deep mantle effects of subduction. Drip-like features imaged in a seismic tomography model are consistent with extensive ongoing thinning of cratonic lithosphere beneath North America."

Here the authors find that light snowfall and snow melting processes drive this mismatch and use these relationships to constrain future projections of snow water resources. 
 Although Earth system models (ESMs) tend to overestimate historical land surface warming, they also overestimate snow amounts in the Northern Hemisphere. By combining ground-based datasets and ESMs, we find that this paradoxical phenomenon is predominantly driven by an overestimation of light snowfall frequency. Using spatially distributed emergent constraints, we show that this paradox persists in mid- (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100) projections, affecting more than half of the Northern Hemisphere’s land surface. ESMs underestimate the frequency of freezing days by 12–19% and overestimate snow water equivalent by 28–34%. Constrained projections indicate that the raw ESM outputs overestimate future Northern Hemisphere snowmelt water by 12–16% across 53–60% of the Northern Hemisphere’s land surface. This snowmelt water overprediction implies that the amount of water available in the future for agriculture, industry, ecosystems and domestic use may be lower than unadjusted ESM projections suggest.

 Active chlorine, including HClO and ClO−, is one of the most extensively used disinfectants. However, it is mainly produced through energy-consuming three-step chlor-alkali electrolysis of saturated brine using Cl2 gases as intermediates. Here we report a photoelectrochemical synthetic pathway from natural seawater using a chloride-mediated NbClOx/BiVO4 photoanode. The photoanode presents an onset potential of 0.6 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and over 500 h of stability in seawater under one sun illumination. The faradaic efficiency and selectivity of hypochlorite are close to 100% at 1.2–1.8 VRHE with a yield of 119.9 ± 9 μmol cm−2 h−1 at 1.72 VRHE. Meanwhile, value-added products of Mg(OH)2 and CaCO3 are obtained on the cathode, accompanied by hydrogen production. Further analyses show that the present process reduces electricity consumption by 77.16% and CO2 emissions by 75.31%.

 Anthropogenic emission reductions resulting from carbon neutrality and clean air policies in China, one of the world’s major emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2) and aerosols, are likely to influence regional and global photovoltaic (PV) outputs by affecting climate change. Here, we use the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) to assess quantitatively how China’s emission reductions toward carbon neutrality will influence the PV potential (PVPOT) and the extremely low PV outputs in the mid-21st century (2041−2060). We find that the large reductions in anthropogenic emissions in the context of China’s carbon neutrality will increase the PVPOT and reduce the occurrence of extremely low PV outputs over some regions in the mid-low latitude continents, especially in East Asia, mainly through increasing the downwelling solar flux at the surface. Our results indicate that China’s carbon neutrality and clean air policies will not only trigger local positive feedback between anthropogenic emission reductions and PV increases but will also generate additional PV enhancements to remote regions, including eastern Australia, South Asia, southern Africa, and eastern South America.

Rewilding is a growing conservation approach encompassing the recovery of ecological and trophic complexity through interventions such as habitat restoration and/or species reintroduction. Here we explore the nascent efforts of marine rewilding using a systems thinking methodology to inform a systematic review and iterative thematic analysis. Marine rewilding involves a diverse range of interventions, showing similarities in ecological principles with terrestrial rewilding, yet it diverges from terrestrial rewilding in the scale of initiatives, predictability of outcomes, and the prominence of social inclusion. To make progress in offering unifying concepts, we propose a definition for marine rewilding: a systemic process requiring deliberate human intervention that involves community participation and ocean stewardship to regenerate degraded marine ecosystems. The concept of rewilding, an approach to conservation aimed at the recovery of complex ecosystems, can be extended from the terrestrial to the marine realm and applied to degraded marine ecosystems."

 Representative non-exhaust emissions from automobiles and tire-wear particles (TWPs) accumulate in road dust, causing their dispersion into the surrounding environment. TWPs undergo fragmentation due to continuous abrasion and weathering, resulting in the release of carbon black (CB), a major component of tire rubber. Although previous studies have conducted mass flow analyses (MFAs) for TWPs based on vehicle and road types, a detailed MFA specifically addressing road dust, including CB-bound TWPs, has not been performed. In this study, annual emissions of TWPs, including CB, from road dust were estimated based on different vehicle and road types. Mass flow diagrams were constructed to illustrate the distribution of these particles across technical and environmental compartments for each road type. The environmental mass of TWPs, including CB, in each compartment was calculated based on sewage system type, runoff ratio, road cleaning efficacy, and UV exposure. The MFA results indicate that highways contribute significantly to TWP exposure in soil and air, despite a substantial portion of TWPs also accumulating as road residue. Additionally, the endpoint mass flow of the environmental media (4241 t/a to air, 3140 t/a to water bodies, 20,602 t/a to soil, 3044 t/a to landfill, and 12,712 t/a to road residue) and the predicted environmental concentration values (1.16 μg/m3 in air, 0.37 mg/L in water, and 1824 mg/kg in soil) were consistent with literature ranges, supporting the reliability of the findings. These results underscore the importance of targeted road dust management strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of non-exhaust emissions."

Given that the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) can simulate k′ and ozone production, uncertainties arise when apply these models to complex ambient atmospheres. We conducted smog-chamber experiments using VOC mixtures under well-controlled conditions. ktotal′ and trace species in the smog-chamber were measured and concurrently simulated by MCM model. The MCM reproduced initial time variations of trace species and ktotal′. We found a corresponding relationship of kmissing′/[HCHO] = 1.5 s−1 ppbv−1 based on the smog-chamber experiments and several field campaigns’ results in Japan. We further applied this factor in 2017 Tsukuba campaign to predict kmissing′ based on diurnal HCHO concentration and obtained good performance of kmissing′ when compared with ktotal′−kcalc′.

 Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) and O3 fluxes and concentrations, along with environmental variables such as solar radiation and air temperature, were measured in a tropical rubber tree plantation in China from August 2018 to June 2019. The detected BVOC fluxes included five terpenoid compounds, isoprene and four monoterpenes, measured using a gradient (GRA) sampling system deployed on an above canopy flux tower. Isoprene accounted for only 13 % of total terpenoid emissions at this site. The remaining 87 % of total terpenoid emissions were dominated by α-pinene (16 %), camphene (20 %), β-pinene (19 %), and limonene (32 %). Isoprene and monoterpene emission fluxes showed clear diurnal variations, with higher emissions around noon and lower emissions in the morning and late evening. The emission peaks typically occurred several hours after the peak in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) around noon. Isoprene and monoterpene emissions also varied seasonally. O3 fluxes were negative (downward) and peaked around noon, with the highest fluxes observed in the dry season. BVOC concentrations at the bottom and top levels were higher around noon, and concentrations were higher at the bottom level than at the top level, indicating upward fluxes. O3 concentrations at the bottom and top levels showed clear diurnal variations, with higher values around noon. O3 concentrations at the top level were higher than those at the bottom level. BVOC emissions and ozone flux, along with their concentrations, are correlated with atmospheric conditions including PAR, air temperature (T), and water vapor and appear to be influenced by smoke plumes. The relationships between BVOC emission, ozone flux, atmospheric conditions (represented by S/Q, the ratio of solar scattered radiation to global radiation), and their concentrations and S/Q were investigated. These relationships can be used to better understand and inform strategies for controlling ozone pollution in China and other locations."

 The heavy class imbalance problem and the multi-source observations fusion remain challenges for lightning nowcasting based on deep learning method. To address the problems, this paper proposes a novel lightning augmented recurrent nowcasting (LARN) model which trained with a two-step training approach. The first training stage is designed as a lightning augmented pretraining (LAP) module based on self-supervised learning method, which can focus on the critical lightning events to solve the heavy class imbalance problem. The second training stage is designed as a multi-modal data fusion module (MDF), which can effectively fuse lightning, radar and satellite observations to nowcasting lightning. The results of experimental evaluations demonstrate the performance of LARN model outperforms the existing nowcasting models with lead times for up to 90 min. The ablation study shows that the two training stages cooperate well, with the LAP module improving the hit rate and the MDF module reducing the false alarm rate. For the radar and satellite modalities, the vertically integrated liquid (VIL) exhibits the most informative power for lightning nowcasting, followed by 10.7 μm brightness temperatures (IR107) and then 6.9 μm brightness temperatures (IR069). Case studies show that the LARN model can better predict the lightning evolution under different type of thunderstorms. Since the LARN model can reflect the lightning distribution in the reality scenes without adopting under-sampling strategy and subjective loss function design, therefore it can apply to different lightning datasets."

 Atmospheric deposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is not routinely measured in existing observation networks worldwide. This paucity of measurements prevents the comprehensive assessment of the global DOC budget in the atmosphere and is currently a barrier to understanding the vital role of the airborne DOC input to soil and water. In this study, 172 observations of atmospheric DOC deposition at the global scale published between 1985 and 2024 were compiled. Overall, the global geometric mean DOC concentration and flux were 2.03 ± 2.12 mg C L−1 and 18 kg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively, with a global budget of approximately 460 Tg C yr−1. While these values are comparable to those reported in previous global-scale studies, they differ across regions. Spatially, the DOC deposition fluxes observed in Africa, Central America, and South America were 2–7 times greater than those reported in North America, Europe, and Asia, which conforms with the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation in these regions, especially for an annual precipitation greater than 1400 mm. When the annual precipitation is less than 1400 mm, the spatial distribution of atmospheric DOC deposition is also influenced by emissions. Owing to the substantial decline in emissions, atmospheric DOC deposition has declined in North America, Asia, and especially in China over the past 10 years."

 This study focuses on heat waves (HWs) variability over South Asia (SA) influenced by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during 1950–2023. The influence factor and driving mechanism for HWs variability over SA in the El Niño and La Niña years are discussed. We observe positive composite anomalies of HWs events and frequency over the north-western region of SA in La Niña years but negative composite anomalies in El Niño years. In La Niña years, outgoing long-wave radiation (total cloud cover) over the north-western region of SA has positive (negative) anomalies. Thus, less cloud cover regions allow more solar radiation to increase the surface temperature and HWs. During La Niña years, positive composite anomalies of HWs over the north-western region of SA are mainly due to positive anomalies of outgoing long wave radiation, negative anomalies of total cloud cover, positive anomalies of soil temperature level 1, negative anomalies of relative humidity, positive anomalies of short-wave radiation and negative anomalies of long-wave radiation. However, during El Niño years, negative composite anomalies of HWs over the north-western region of SA are due to negative anomalies of outgoing long wave radiation, positive anomalies of total cloud cover, and negative anomalies of direct solar radiation. During El Niño years, vertical-latitude cross-section and vertical-longitude cross-section analysis show significant positive anomalies of air temperature, positive anomalies of vertical velocity, negative anomalies of relative humidity, and positive anomalies of geopotential height; support increases in the HWs over the southern and central -eastern region of SA. These findings give important insights into how future weather patterns may evolve during ENSO events and can contribute to early forecasting and making heat wave adaptation strategies."

 The evaluation of precipitation events is crucial for predicting severe droughts and floods, particularly in the context of global warming. This study presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of the global precipitation concentration index (CI) from 1950 to 2020, comparing CI with nine extreme precipitation indices to assess its applicability. The world map was divided into three distinct regions related to flood-drought events using the standardized precipitation index (SPI). Key findings include: 1) CI exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity, with elevated values in seasonally warm coastlines and arid regions. Seasonal changes in CI were not synchronized, particularly lower in Northern Hemisphere winters, while the Southern Hemisphere displayed minor seasonal variation, alongside a long-term growth trend in approximately 36.5 % of the global area. 2) CI's spatiotemporal variations helped delineating regional precipitation patterns, revealing a strong correlation (R2 = 0.87) with the extreme precipitation index R95c, but a negligible relationship with total precipitation (P) (R2 = -0.05). This facilitated the global partitioning into three regions: Humidity Amplification Region (I), Dryness Intensification Region (II), and Climate Fluctuation Region (III). 3) Flood-drought events were potentially linked to variations in CI and P, where In Region I experienced increased flood risk due to rising CI and P, Region II faced heightened drought risk from rising CI and declining P, and Region III showed opposing effects on floods due to reduced CI and increased P, with P variability significantly influencing flood frequency. 4) The main atmospheric circulation factors varied by region, typically including the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO), with AAO being most significant. This study highlights the potential of CI in improving the prediction of drought and flood risks, emphasizing the need for enhanced regional data and dynamic modeling to better assess the impacts of climate change on precipitation patterns and hydrological extremes."

 The impact of aerosol on the development of deep convective clouds and the growth of hydrometeors was investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with a detailed spectral bin microphysics scheme. The simulated cloud top temperature, the vertical profile of moving speed of hydrometeors, and the spatial distributions of precipitation rate were compared with observations from satellite, cloud radar, and weather stations, respectively. The results show that the smaller cloud droplets in the polluted condition have greater mobility with ambient air, which can reach up to 10 km of altitude comparing with 7 km in clean condition, thereby increase the collecting efficiency between ice crystals and supercooled liquid droplets therein. Moreover, ice crystals move slowly around 8 km, thereby facilitating the riming of ice particles by supercooled water to form hailstones. The efficient upward transport of cloud droplets in the convective core area further amplifies this process. Increased aerosol concentration enhances the hail production rate by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, and results in a 3.48 % increase in effective terminal velocity of hailstone from surface to 4.5 km. The aerosol-induced hail growth effect is stronger over convective cores than that over non-core area. The intensified sedimentation of hail and its accompanying melting in strong downdraft regions contribute to the increased surface precipitation at late stage of convection in polluted condition."

Parkhitko and Valentin Cracan,Xenotopic synthetic biology: Prospective tools for delaying aging and age-related diseases,"Metabolic dysregulation represents one of the major driving forces in aging. Although multiple genetic and pharmacological manipulations are known to extend longevity in model organisms, aging is a complex trait, and targeting one’s own genes may be insufficient to prevent age-dependent deterioration. An alternative strategy could be to use enzymes from other species to reverse age-associated metabolic changes. In this review, we discuss a set of enzymes from lower organisms that have been shown to affect various metabolic parameters linked to age-related processes. These enzymes include modulators of steady-state levels of amino acids (METase, ASNase, and ADI), NADPH/NADP+and/or reduced form of coenzyme Q (CoQH2)/CoQ redox potentials (NDI1, AOX,LbNOX, TPNOX,EcSTH, RquA, LOXCAT, Grubraw, and ScURA), GSH (StGshF), mitochondrial membrane potential (mtON and mito-dR), or reactive oxygen species (DAAO and KillerRed-SOD1).

However, safe, low-cost, multifunctional micromanipulation for operating bio-objects across scales and modalities remains inaccessible.

It enables multiple liquid micromanipulations, including mixing, dispersion, enhancing cell membrane permeability, and harvesting selected cells. Furthermore, a controllable three-dimensional axisymmetric vortex in an open environment overcomes the constraints of microfluidic chip, enabling stable trapping, rapid transportation, and multidirectional rotation of HeLa cells, embryos, and other bio-objects ranging from micrometers to millimeters.

Recently, single-atom-thick gold sheets, termed goldene, was reported. Here, we ask if goldene can be extended to include multiple layers. The answer is yes, and trilayer goldene is the magic number, for reasons of electronegativity. Experiments are made to synthesize the atomically laminated phase Ti4Au3C3through substitutional intercalation of Si layers in Ti4SiC3for Au. Density functional theory calculations suggest that it is energetically favorable to insert three layers of Au into Ti4SiC3, compared to inserting a monolayer, a bilayer, or more than three layers. Isolated trilayer goldene sheets, ~100 nanometers wide and 6.7 angstroms thick, were obtained by chemically etching the Ti4C3layers from Ti4Au3C3templates.

When salt water overlays permafrost, Rayleigh-Darcy (R-D) instability emerges because of the density mismatch and regulates melting (thawing) dynamics. Contrary to expectations that a higher Rayleigh number (R) would amplify instability, our experiments revealed fingering and stable melting fronts at low and highR, respectively. We attribute the occurrence of the two melting patterns to the interplay between two competing flow structures: local circumfluence modulated by front perturbation and transversal chaotic mixing. We propose theories that rationalize the melting pattern transition and finger-scale evolution. In addition, the classic mass transport theory for R-D convection drastically underestimates the melting rate and misses key variable(s). The presence of fingering patterns and accelerated dynamics may have led to earlier penetration of the permafrost layer than previously anticipated. These findings have implications for understanding similar processes in magma migration, carbon sequestration, and subsurface energy recovery."

The textures span several nanometers and encompass many hundred spins; they are created and interrogated without manipulating the nuclear spins individually. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-engineered Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field: The texture is therefore metastable and robust against spin diffusion.

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, subhertz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the SNSPD’s straight segments with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current crowding–free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: After irradiation with 800 ions nm−2, locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37%, while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently. We achieve an internal detection efficiency of 94% with 7 mHz dark count rate near the onset of saturating detection efficiency for a wavelength of 780 nm."

Anomalies in the retrieved ammonia abundance and atmospheric temperature show how storms deplete and heat the upper atmosphere while simultaneously depositing material well below the layers they were triggered at.

Emerging data from human studies and epidemiological models suggest that increased divergence in contemporary viruses may drive differential cross-protection, where infection with Yamagata lineage viruses provides limited immunity against Victoria lineage viruses. Here, we developed animal models to investigate the mechanisms behind asymmetric cross-protection between contemporary FLUBV lineages. Our results show that contemporary Victoria immunity provides robust cross-protection against the Yamagata lineage, whereas Yamagata immunity offers limited protection against the Victoria lineage. This differential cross-protection is driven by Victoria-elicited neuraminidase (NA)–specific antibodies, which show cross-lineage reactivity, unlike those from Yamagata infections.

It is present in Africa, Europe, Asia, and in the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. There are no effective treatments or broadly licensed vaccines to prevent disease. Efforts to counteract ASF have been hampered because of the lack of convenient tools to engineer its etiological agent, ASF virus (ASFV), largely due to its large noninfectious genome. Here, we report the use of synthetic genomics methodology to develop a reverse genetics system for ASFV using a CRISPR-Cas9–inhibited self-helper virus to reconstitute live recombinant ASFV from synthetic genomes to rapidly generate a variety of combinatorial mutants of ASFV. The method will substantially facilitate the development of therapeutics or subunit and live-attenuated vaccines for ASF. This synthetic genomics-based approach has wide-ranging impact because it can be applied to rapidly develop reverse genetics tools for emerging viruses with noninfectious genomes."

Most patients suffer from a risk of difficult-to-cure as well as severe systemic toxicity when receiving standard chemotherapies. As hyaluronic acid (HA) is a specific ligand of CD44 highly expressed by LSCs, we had HA self-assembled with cisplatin and daunorubicin to form a dual chemodrug nanogel (HA/Cis/Dau) to afford the targeted therapeutic interventions of rrAML. HA/Cis/Dau displayed an extra therapeutic function of inducing the granulocyte-monocyte differentiation in CD44+rrAML cells, an rrAML mouse model, and primary blasts isolated from patients with AML. Unlike free drugs directly diffusing and killing rrAML cells, HA/Cis/Dau transported the drugs into lysosomes, causing lysosomal membrane permeabilization, ROS accumulation, and thus a metabolic reprogramming of the rrAML cells. Moreover, HA/Cis/Dau was featured with alleviated side effects, ease of preparation, and cost effectiveness, therefore holding great promises for the targeted treatment of rrAML."

To mitigate such escape, we preemptively enhance AZD3152, an antibody authorized for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, we identify AZD3152 vulnerabilities at antigen positions F456 and D420. Through two iterations of computational antibody design that integrates structure-based modeling, machine-learning, and experimental validation, we co-optimize AZD3152 against 24 contemporary and previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as 20 potential future escape variants. Our top candidate, 3152-1142, restores full potency (100-fold improvement) against the more recently emerged XBB.1.5+F456L variant that escaped AZD3152, maintains potency against previous variants of concern, and shows no additional vulnerability as assessed by DMS. This preemptive mitigation demonstrates a generalizable approach for optimizing existing antibodies against potential future viral escape."

Current techniques can be improved by safely increasing metabolic contrast. The gold standard, 2-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, is limited by radioactive exposure and sparse assessment of metabolism beyond glucose uptake and retention. Deuterium magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) with [6,6-2H2]glucose is nonradioactive, achieves tumor metabolic contrast, but can be improved by enriched contrast from deuterated water (HDO) based imaging. Here, we developed a DMRI protocol employing [2H7]glucose. Imaging2H-signal and measuring HDO production in tumor-bearing mice detected differential glucose utilization across baseline tumors, tumors treated with vehicle control or anti-glycolytic BRAFi and MEKi therapy, and contralateral healthy tissue. Control tumors generated the most2H-signal and HDO. To our knowledge this is the first application of DMRI with [2H7]glucose for tumoral treatment monitoring. This approach demonstrates HDO as a marker of tumor glucose utilization and suggests translational capability in humans due to its safety, noninvasiveness, and suitability for serial monitoring."

Alternative pathways (APs) have been designed to relocate the decarboxylation step or even fix additional carbon. To improve the success of transferring those engineered APs from model species to crops, we must understand how they will interact with metabolism and how plant physiology affects their performance. Here, we used multiple mathematical modeling techniques to analyze and compare existing AP designs. We show that carbon-fixing APs are the most promising candidates to replace native photorespiration in major crop species. Our results demonstrate the different metabolic routes that APs use to increase yield and which plant physiology can profit the most from them. We anticipate our results to guide the design of new APs and to help improve existing ones."

Cells must deform the large nucleus to fit through constricting channels. To understand the role of the nuclear lamina in limiting cell migration through constrictions, we imaged it in cells migrating through periodic constricting channels in a microdevice. The lamina underwent cycles of wrinkling and smoothing as the nucleus changed from an irregular, rounded shape in the wide channel regions between constrictions to a smooth, hourglass shape as the nucleus passed through the center of a constriction. The laminar surface area of nuclei within constrictions was measured to be at or above the computationally predicted threshold area for the nuclear volume. The channels excluded control nuclei that had insufficient excess surface area, but not nuclei lacking lamin A/C. Thus, the excess surface area of the nuclear lamina enables cell migration through constricting channels."

Understanding physical differences between euchromatin and heterochromatin is crucial, yet specific labeling methods in living cells remain limited. Here, we have developed replication-dependent histone (Repli-Histo) labeling to mark nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. Using this approach, we investigated local nucleosome motion in the four known chromatin classes, from euchromatin to heterochromatin, of living human and mouse cells. The more euchromatic (earlier-replicated) and more heterochromatic (later-replicated) regions exhibit greater and lesser nucleosome motions, respectively. Notably, the motion profile in each chromatin class persists throughout interphase. Genome chromatin is essentially replicated from regions with greater nucleosome motions, although the replication timing is perturbed. Our findings, combined with computational modeling, suggest that earlier-replicated regions have more accessibility, and local chromatin motion can be a major determinant of genome-wide replication timing."

However, the molecular role of Headcase has remained elusive. Here, we identify Headcase as a component of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. We also show that, Headcase is required for proper RNP granule formation and remodeling upon stress and is crucial for translation control. Likewise, the human Headcase homolog (HECA) is identified as a component of RNP granules and has similar roles in translational regulation and stress protection. Thus, Headcase proteins define a new family contributing to specific roles among the RNP heterogeneous network."

Genome-wide association studies have linked schizophrenia to genetic variations ofAS3MT(arsenite methyltransferase) gene, particularly the increased expression of AS3MTd2d3isoform. To investigate the biological basis of this association with schizophrenia pathophysiology, we established a transgenic mouse model (AS3MTd2d3-Tg) ectopically expressing AS3MTd2d3at the cortical neural stem cells. AS3MTd2d3-Tg mice exhibited enlarged ventricles and deficits in sensorimotor gating and sociability. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses of AS3MTd2d3-Tg brains revealed cell fate imbalances and altered excitatory neuron composition. AS3MTd2d3localized to centrosome, disrupting mitotic spindle orientation and differentiation in developing neocortex and organoids, in part through NPM1 (Nucleophosmin 1). The structural analysis identified that hydrophobic residues exposed in AS3MTd2d3are critical for its pathogenic function.

This approach allows for the fabrication of self-assembled 3D-nanostructured electronic devices. DNA strands are bound onto the gold arrays, which anchor DNA origami frames and promote ordered framework growth on the specific areas of the surface, enabling control of the lateral placement and orientation of superlattices. DNA frameworks selectively grown on the pads are subsequently templated to nanoscale silica and tin oxide (SnOx) that follow the architecture, as confirmed by structural and chemical characterizations. The fabricated SnOxsuperlattices are integrated into devices that demonstrate photocurrent response."
