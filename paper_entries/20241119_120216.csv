E. Vos;Wim de Vries;G. F. (Ciska) Veen;Marcel R. Hoosbeek;Frank J. Sterck,Testing ion exchange resin for quantifying bulk and throughfall deposition of macro- and micro-elements in forests,"Atmospheric deposition poses risks with high anthropogenic inputs. Current deposition measurement methods are labor-intensive. Ion exchange resin (IER) offers a promising, cost-effective alternative. We assessed IER for bulk deposition and throughfall, testing adsorption capacity, recovery efficiency and field performance. IER showed good adsorption and recovery and was unaffected by environmental conditions, showing potential for robust and efficient measurements of atmospheric deposition. 
 Atmospheric deposition is a major nutrient influx in ecosystems, while high anthropogenic deposition may disrupt ecosystem functioning. Quantification of the deposition flux is required to understand the impact of such anthropogenic pollution. However, current methods to measure nutrient deposition are costly, labor-intensive and potentially inaccurate.Ion exchange resin (IER) appears to be a promising cost- and labor-effective method. The IER method is potentially suited for deposition measurements on coarse timescales and for areas with little rainfall and/or low elemental concentrations. The accuracy of the IER method is, however, hardly classified beyond nitrogen. We tested the IER method for bulk deposition and throughfall measurements of macro- and micro-elements, assessing resin adsorption capacity, recovery efficiency and field behavior.We show that IER is able to adsorb 100 % of Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P, S, Zn and NO3- and > 96 % of P and Na. Loading the resin beyond its capacity resulted mainly in losses of Na, P and NH4+, while losses of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn and Zn were hardly detected. Heat (40 °C), drought and frost (−15 °C) reduced the adsorption of P by 25 %. Recovery was close to 100 % for NH4+ and NO3- using KCl solution (1 or 2 M), while high (83 %–93 %) recoveries of Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn and S were found using HCl as an extractant (2–4 M). We found good agreement between the conventional method and the IER method for field conditions.Overall, IER is a powerful tool for the measurement of atmospheric deposition of a broad range of elements as the measurements showed high accuracy. The IER method therefore has the potential to expand current monitoring networks and increase the number of sampling sites."

Rosenberger;David D. Turner;Thijs Heus;Girish N. Raghunathan;Timothy J. Wagner;Julia Simonson,Improving the estimate of higher-order moments from lidar observations near the top of the convective boundary layer,"This work used model output to show that considering the changes in boundary layer depth over time in the calculations of variables such as fluxes and variance yields more accurate results than cases where calculations were done at a constant height. This work was done to improve future observations of these variables at the top of the boundary layer. 
 Ground-based lidar data have proven extremely useful for profiling the convective boundary layer (CBL). Many groups have derived higher-order moments (e.g., variance, skewness, fluxes) from high-temporal-resolution lidar data using an autocovariance approach. However, these analyses are highly uncertain near the CBL top when the depth of the CBL (zi) is changing during the analysis period.  This is because the autocovariance approach is usually applied to constant height levels and the character of the eddies is changing on either side of the changing CBL top. Here, a new approach is presented wherein the autocovariance analysis is performed on a normalized height grid, with a temporally smoothed zi. Output from a large eddy simulation model demonstrates that deriving higher-order moments from time series on a normalized height grid has better agreement with the slab-averaged quantities than the moments derived from the original height grid."

This dataset provides insights into the spectral properties of macrophyte species characteristic to the temperate geographic region. Such information is often lacking in the data format, while it is essential for remote sensing algorithm development, image classification as well as defining requirements for future remote sensing missions. 
 A hyperspectral reflectance database was acquired for the Baltic Sea submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and bare substrates by using Ramses (TriOS) radiometers capturing the spectral data within the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) spectral range. The target samples included the most dominant and characteristic SAV species in the Baltic Sea, as well as several bare substrate types and beach cast communities. Target samples were measured within the 350 to 900 nm wavelength range under sun light conditions without the water column influence i.e. samples were taken out of the water. Such library is expected to provide insight into the spectral properties of various SAV species and substrates occurring in the coastal waters of the temperate geographic regions facilitating development of algorithms for differentiation and mapping various SAV communities. Additionally, measured reflectance spectra can be used as spectral endmembers in physical models and classification algorithms for coastal vegetation mapping and quantification.

10.5194/gmd-17-8115-2024,False,Geoscientific Model Development,这篇论文提出了一种新的每日干旱指数（GDI），用于改进干旱评估。该指数基于经验，易于计算，无需将数据拟合到概率分布。它可以检测快速干旱和长期干旱事件。研究比较了GDI与标准化降水指数（SPI）、标准化降水蒸散发指数（SPEI）和简单的Z分数标准化方法。结果表明，GDI与SPI和SPEI一样符合标准正态分布，而Z分数指数则依赖于数据的原始分布。GDI在较短和较长的累积期内都比SPI和SPEI具有更高的附加值。该研究主要关注干旱指数的开发和比较，并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关系不大。,"['precipitation', 'evapotranspiration', 'drought monitoring', 'climatic variables', 'daily drought index', 'GDI', 'SPI', 'SPEI']",João António Martins Careto;Rita Margarida Cardoso;Ana Russo;Daniela Catarina André Lima;Pedro Miguel Matos Soares,Generalised drought index: a novel multi-scale daily approach for drought assessment,"This study proposes a new daily drought index, the generalised drought index (GDI). The GDI not only identifies the same events as established indices but is also capable of improving their results. The index is empirically based and easy to compute, not requiring fitting the data to a probability distribution. The GDI can detect flash droughts and longer-term events, making it a versatile tool for drought monitoring. 
 Drought is a complex climatic phenomenon characterised by water scarcity and is recognised as the most widespread and insidious natural hazard, posing significant challenges to ecosystems and human society. In this study, we propose a new daily based index for characterising droughts, which involves standardising precipitation and/or precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (PET) data. The new index proposed here, the generalised drought index (GDI), is computed for the entire period available from the Iberian Gridded Dataset (1971 to 2015). Comparative assessments are conducted against the daily Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and a simple Z-Score standardisation of climatic variables. Seven different accumulation periods are considered (7, 15, 30, 90, 180, 360, and 720 d) with three drought levels: moderate, severe, and extreme. The evaluation focuses mainly on the direct comparison amongst indices in terms of their ability to conform to the standard normal distribution, added value assessment using the distribution added value (DAV), and a simple bias difference for drought characteristics. Results reveal that the GDI, together with the SPI and SPEI, follows the standard normal distribution. In contrast, the Z-Score index depends on the original distribution of the data. The daily time step of all indices allows the characterisation of flash droughts, with the GDI demonstrating added value when compared to the SPI and SPEI for the shorter and longer accumulations, with a positive DAV up to 35 %. Compared to the Z-Score, the GDI shows expected greater gains, particularly at lower accumulation periods, with the DAV reaching 100 %. Furthermore, the spatial extent of drought for the 2004–2005 event is assessed. All three indices generally provide similar representations, except for the Z-Score, which exhibits limitations in capturing extreme drought events at lower accumulation periods. Overall, the findings suggest that the new index offers improved performance and comparatively adds value to similar indices with a daily time step."

However, little is known about the cross-generational toxicity of MPs on terrestrial invertebrates. In this study, two-generational Eisenia fetida was exposed to low-density polyethylene (LDPE, 0–5%, w/w) for 98 days to reveal the cross-generational toxicity and the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that LDPE-MPs not only perpetrated deleterious effects on the development, hatchability, and fecundity of the F0 generation but also stimulated the antioxidant defense activity, inhibited lipid peroxidation, and disordered neurotransmission in F1 generation individuals. The susceptibility of the epidermal–intestinal barrier to LDPE-MPs was dose-dependent. According to the transcriptomic analysis, the cross-generational earthworms confirmed significant perturbances in the cell cycle, neural activity-related pathways, and amino acid metabolism pathways (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, the metabolomic profile of F1 generation individuals exhibited significant hyperactive responses in glutathione metabolism and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (p < 0.05). This study provides a comprehensive knowledge of LDPE-MPs toxicity on cross-generational earthworms and highlights the hyperactive responses in the antioxidant defense performance of the offsprings. Our findings also underscore the necessity for long-term investigations in assessing the adverse impacts of emerging pollutants."

Due to their wide variety of chemical properties, simultaneous analysis of multiclass CECs presents a great challenge. This study develops an innovative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method that integrates both large volume injection (LVI) and online solid phase extraction to quantify 102 CECs. The method utilizes three columns: a reversed phase (RP) column, a custom-built mixed weak cation/anion exchange trap column, and a mixed-mode ion exchange (MMIE) column. With valve switching, highly polar/ionic CECs that are not retained by the RP column are captured by the trap column while other CECs are separated by the RP column. Subsequently, the trapped highly polar/ionic CECs are transferred to the MMIE column for further separation. Matrix effects from sewage effluent and urine samples were assessed, and the method accuracy and precision were also determined using spike recovery. LVI notably enhanced the method sensitivity, with the method quantification limits for 93 of the 102 CECs in various water matrices being <10 ng L–1. Overall, this novel column-switching LC-MS method enables the rapid and simultaneous determination of multiclass CECs in diverse aqueous samples."
10.1029/2024EF005091,False,Earth's Future,这篇论文主要研究的是大气中二氧化碳浓度上升对全球径流（地表径流和地下径流）的影响。它利用14个地球系统模型，模拟了CO2浓度以每年1%的速度增加的情况，分析了这种增加对径流的不同组分的影响，并探讨了水供应、大气需水量和植被调节等因素的作用。研究发现，随着CO2浓度的增加，全球总径流将增加，这主要源于地下径流的增加，导致地下径流比例升高。植被调节是导致地下径流比例升高的最重要因素。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，因为它关注的是气候变化对水文循环的影响，而不是大气成分的直接观测或分析。,"['CO2', 'water vapor', 'runoff', 'Earth system models', 'climate change']",Hao Wang;Xiaomang Liu;Kaiwen Wang;Changming Liu,Response of Global Runoff Components to Rising CO2,"Rising atmospheric CO2 is anticipated to influence global runoff through its radiative effect and physiological effect, thereby resulting in profound impacts on water availability and security. While existing literature has explored the two effects on global total runoff, there is still a lack of attention to changes in runoff components (surface and subsurface runoff). Here, based on idealized 1% yr−1 CO2 increase experiments and 14 Earth system models, we decouple the two effects on changes in runoff components and disentangle the contributions of three influencing factors, namely water supply, atmospheric water demand, and vegetation regulation, which are closely intertwined with the two effects. Global total runoff is expected to increase with rising CO2, and this increase mainly comes from subsurface runoff, leading to an elevated subsurface runoff ratio. Vegetation regulation emerges as the most important factor for the increase in subsurface runoff ratio, with the contribution of 49.3%, followed by water supply (41.7%) and atmospheric water demand (8.9%). Increased total runoff implies potentially more flood risk, while the increase in subsurface runoff ratio could decrease some of the risk. The results indicate the necessity of emphasizing changes in subsurface runoff under climate change."

This study employs observational data sets with high spatiotemporal resolution to analyze the risk of occurrence of compound dry‐hot events in China over the past 120 years (i.e., 1901–2020). Simultaneously, attribution analysis based on distribution functions explores whether and to what extent human activities influence the occurrence of compound events. The results indicate that over the historical 120‐year period, the frequency of compound dry‐hot events in China has gradually increased, with the highest frequency observed in the most recent 40 years (i.e., 1981–2020). The frequency of compound dry‐hot events during this period is approximately four times that of 1901–1940 and about twice that of 1941–1980. The analysis of the relative importance of different factors reveals that temperature changes contribute more (56%) to the occurrence of compound events than precipitation (23%), and also exceed the interaction between them (21%). The substantial increase in compound dry‐hot events is largely attributed to the influence of human activities. Across seven sub‐regions, human activities have led to an increase in the probability of compound events occurring, ranging from 7.9% to 31.6%. The findings of this study indicate that human activities have significant implications for explaining the observed increase in compound hot and dry events over the past 40 years."

 Achieving net zero global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), with declining emissions of other greenhouse gases, is widely expected to halt global warming. CO2 emissions will continue to drive warming until fully balanced by active anthropogenic CO2 removals. For practical reasons, however, many greenhouse gas accounting systems allow some “passive” CO2 uptake, such as enhanced vegetation growth due to CO2 fertilisation, to be included as removals in the definition of net anthropogenic emissions. By including passive CO2 uptake, nominal net zero emissions would not halt global warming, undermining the Paris Agreement. Here we discuss measures addressing this problem, to ensure residual fossil fuel use does not cause further global warming: land management categories should be disaggregated in emissions reporting and targets to better separate the role of passive CO2 uptake; where possible, claimed removals should be additional to passive uptake; and targets should acknowledge the need for Geological Net Zero, meaning one tonne of CO2 permanently restored to the solid Earth for every tonne still generated from fossil sources. We also argue that scientific understanding of net zero provides a basis for allocating responsibility for the protection of passive carbon sinks during and after the transition to Geological Net Zero."

 Reducing body weight to improve metabolic health and related comorbidities is a primary goal in treating obesity1,2. However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes3,4. Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of mouse adipocytes that negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types. These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic ‘yo-yo’ effect often seen with dieting.

 The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is the main driver of northward heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean today, setting global climate patterns. Whether global warming has affected the strength of this overturning circulation over the past century is still debated: observational studies suggest that there has been persistent weakening since the mid-twentieth century, whereas climate models systematically simulate a stable circulation. Here, using Earth system and eddy-permitting coupled ocean–sea-ice models, we show that a freshening of the subarctic Atlantic Ocean and weakening of the overturning circulation increase the temperature and salinity of the South Atlantic on a decadal timescale through the propagation of Kelvin and Rossby waves. We also show that accounting for upper-end meltwater input in historical simulations significantly improves the data–model agreement on past changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, yielding a slowdown of 0.46 sverdrups per decade since 1950. Including estimates of subarctic meltwater input for the coming century suggests that this circulation could be 33% weaker than its anthropogenically unperturbed state under 2 °C of global warming, which could be reached over the coming decade. Such a weakening of the overturning circulation would substantially affect the climate and ecosystems.

 Sodium sulfide (Na2S) as an initial cathode material in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries is conducive to get rid of the dependence on Na-metal anode. However, the micron-sized Na2S that accords with the practical requirements is obstructed due to poor kinetics and severe shuttle effect. Herein, a subtle strategy is proposed via regulating Na2S redeposition behaviours. By the synergistic effect from both conductive structure and cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) catalysis, the micron-sized Na2S particles are broken down and redeposited to nano-size during the initial cycle which can be fully utilized in subsequent cycles. Consequently, the Na2S/CPVP@Cu2S||Na cell delivers excellent cyclability (670 mAh gS−1 after 500 cycles) with a remarkable average Coulombic efficiency over 99.7% and rate capability (480 mAh gS−1 at 4 A gS−1). Besides, the Na-free anodes are used to prove the application prospects. This work provides an innovative idea for utilizing micron-sized Na2S and offers insights into its conversion pathway.

 The dynamic modulation of the aggregation process of small molecules represents an important research objective for scientists. However, the complex and dynamic nature of internal environments in vivo impedes controllable aggregation processes of single molecules. In this study, we successfully achieve tumor-targeted aggregation of an aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer (AIE-PS), TBmA, with the catalysis of a tumor-overexpressed enzyme, γ-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT). Mechanistic investigations reveal that TBmA-Glu can be activated by GGT through cleavage of the γ-glutamyl bond and releasing TBmA. The poor water solubility of TBmA induces its aggregation, leading to aggregation-enhanced emission and photodynamic activities. The TBmA-Glu not only induces glutathione (GSH) depletion through GGT photo-degradation but also triggers lipid peroxidation accumulation and ferroptosis in cancer cells through photodynamic therapy. Finally, the in vivo studies conducted on female mice using both tumor xenograft and orthotopic liver cancer models have also demonstrated the significant anti-cancer effects of TBmA-Glu. The exceptional cancer-targeting ability and therapeutic efficiency demonstrated by this GGT activatable AIE-PS highlights enzymatic-mediated modulation as an effective approach for regulating small molecule aggregation intracellularly, thereby advancing innovative therapeutic strategies for various diseases.

 Single-atom skeletal editing is an increasingly powerful tool for scaffold hopping-based drug discovery.

 Altered hepatic glucose fluxes are critical during the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. G protein-coupled receptors represent important regulators of hepatic glucose production. Recent studies have shown that hepatocytes express GPCRs that can couple to G12/13, a subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins that has attracted relatively little attention in the past. Here we show, by analyzing several mutant mouse strains, that selective activation of hepatocyte G12/13 signaling leads to pronounced hyperglycemia and that this effect involves the stimulation of the ROCK1-JNK signaling cascade. Using both mouse and human hepatocytes, we also show that activation of endogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate type 1 receptors strongly promotes glucose release in a G12/13-dependent fashion. Studies with human liver samples indicate that hepatic GNA12 (encoding Gα12) expression levels positively correlate with indices of insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis, consistent with a potential pathophysiological role of enhanced hepatic G12/13 signaling.

Here, the emergence of templated water motifs and their beneficial influence on adsorption are investigated. 
 The intricate hydrogen-bonded network of water gives rise to various structures with anomalous properties at different thermodynamic conditions. Nanoconfinement can further modify the water structure and properties, and induce specific water motifs, which are instrumental for technological applications such as atmospheric water harvesting. However, so far, a causal relationship between nanoconfinement and the presence of specific hydrophilic adsorption sites is lacking, hampering the further design of nanostructured materials for water templating. Therefore, this work investigates the organisation of water in zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with varying topologies, pore sizes, and chemical composition, to extract design rules to shape water. The highly tuneable pores and hydrophilicity of MOFs makes them ideally suited for this purpose. We find that small nanopores favour orderly water clusters that nucleate at hydrophilic adsorption sites. Favourably positioning the secondary adsorption sites, hydrogen-bonded to the primary adsorption sites, allows larger clusters to form at moderate adsorption conditions. To disentangle the importance of nanoconfinement and hydrophilic nucleation sites in this process, we introduce an analytical model with precise control of the adsorption sites. This sheds a new light on design parameters to induce specific water clusters and hydrogen-bonded networks, thus rationalising the application space of water in nanoconfinement.

 Cyclones, whether tropical, extratropical, or of Mediterranean origin, play a crucial role in the Earth’s climate system, affecting environments and populations through strong winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding. While much research has focused on tropical and extratropical cyclones, Mediterranean cyclones have received less attention. These cyclones are generally weaker, smaller, and shorter-lived than their tropical or mid-latitude counterparts. However, recent events, such as Mediterranean cyclone Daniel in 2023, which caused severe flooding and thousands of deaths in Libya, underscore the major threat Mediterranean cyclones pose. In this study, we investigate the role of Mediterranean cyclones in triggering floods in Corsica, a region frequently affected by these storms.

 Peracetic acid (PAA, CH3C(O)OOH) is one of the most abundant organic peroxyacid in the atmosphere. PAA is often assumed to be removed by hydroxyl radical in the gas phase of troposphere, but its reaction rate is quite low. Here, we investigated the new reaction between PAA and carbonyl oxide (CH2OO) by using quantum chemical methods, reaction kinetics in combination with atmospheric modeling. We first performed W3X-L calculations close to CCSDT(Q)/CBS accuracy with the reaction systems containing eight carbon and oxygen atoms. The present findings show that the post-CCSD(T) contribution is about 0.50 kcal/mol, which is important for obtaining quantitative relative enthalpy of activation at 0 K. We find that the recrossing effect reduces the rate constant by an order of magnitude for the mechanism of the hydrogen-shift coupled carbon-oxygen addition at low temperature. The calculated results reveal that the anharmonicity increases the rate constants of CH2OO + CH3C(O)OOH by a factor of 6.27 at 298 K. The present findings uncover that the PAA + CH2OO reaction is a dominant pathway for PAA sinks in the gas phase of troposphere at the lower nighttime OH concentrations at 298 K, since the rate of PAA + CH2OO is even an order of magnitude higher than the rate of the PAA + OH reaction. Moreover, atmospheric modeling simulations unveil that CH2OO can make certain contribution to the reduction of PAA in the Amazon."
None,False,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文的标题和摘要表明，其研究重点是地中海高海拔地区自然环境中空气中花粉的潜在来源。这属于植物学、生态学和气象学的研究范畴。虽然花粉是空气成分的一部分，但该研究似乎并没有直接使用大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。研究可能涉及花粉的采样、鉴定和来源分析等传统方法。,[],Paloma Cariñanos;Soledad Ruiz-Peñuela;Andrea Casans;Alberto Cazorla;Fernando Rejano;Alejandro Ontiveros;Pablo Ortiz-Amezcua;Juan Luis Guerrero-Rascado;Francisco José Olmo;Lucas Alados-Arboledas;Gloria Titos,Assessment of potential sources of airborne pollen in a high-mountain mediterranean natural environment,
None,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文评估和比较了不同WRF-Chem模型配置对预测2022年4月伊朗西部沙尘暴事件中风场的影响。虽然标题和摘要中没有直接提到具体的遥感技术或卫星观测，但研究使用了WRF-Chem模式，这是一种常用的数值天气预报模型，可以结合卫星观测数据和地面观测数据进行空气质量模拟和预测。因此，这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是关于气溶胶（沙尘）的空气质量监测和大气成分分析。研究结果可以用来改进沙尘暴预报模型，提高预报精度，并为环境管理和公共卫生提供支持。,"['Aerosol', 'Dust', 'Air quality', 'Wind field', 'WRF-Chem model', 'Numerical weather prediction', 'Remote sensing (implied)']",Elham Mobarak Hassan;Mahnaz Karimkhani;Jeff Sepehri,Evaluating and comparison of WRF-chem model configurations for wind field impact on the April 2022 dust episode in western Iran,
None,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文分析了希腊塞萨洛尼基30年全球太阳辐照度记录中的云增强事件。它与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为研究云对太阳辐射的影响需要利用卫星观测和大气成分分析技术。通过分析长时间序列的太阳辐照度数据，可以反演云的特性，例如云的类型、云量和云的几何厚度等，从而研究云对地球辐射收支的影响以及云与气候变化之间的关系。  研究中可能用到的卫星传感器包括地球静止气象卫星上的云和辐射传感器，以及极轨气象卫星上的辐射计等。,"['cloud properties', 'solar irradiance', 'satellite remote sensing', 'atmospheric composition', 'radiation budget', 'climate change']",Athanasios N.
