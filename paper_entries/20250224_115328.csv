The increasing GSSIC can lead to a vertical circulation cell anomaly between the polar region and middle latitude over the North Atlantic due to the thermal condition anomalies. The associated anomalous ascending flow over the coast of western Europe generates wave train propagating southeastward from mid‐high latitude Atlantic to the North Indian Ocean (IO), causing anomalous anticyclone over the Indian Ocean. The related anomalous easterlies over tropical IO contribute to the positive IODM (warmer SSTA over west tropical IO but cooler SSTA off Sumatra–Java) through weakening the wind‐evaporation‐SST feedback over tropical IO and shallowing (deepening) thermocline along the coastal of Sumatra‐Java (west tropical IO). Moreover, the numerical experiments can basically reproduce the observed mechanisms."

Brodsky,Precursory Locking Precedes Slip Events on Laboratory Fault,"Earthquakes occur through repeated cycles of locking and slip. What is the relationship between transiently locked patches and the size, location, and timing of the subsequent slip events? Here we use an experimental fault made of transparent rubber to image the slip history of over 18,000 events. The soft elastic system allows for contained ruptures and thus a natural evolution of stress heterogeneity over multiple earthquake cycles. We observe a precursory locking phase preceding slip nucleation for events of all sizes. The integrated locking distance increases linearly with the moment of the eventual event. The most intense (largest slip deficit) locking events are spatially and temporally correlated with the hypocenters of the largest rupture events. These results show that the transient locking is statistically, but not deterministically, predictive of the location, timing, and size of the eventual slip event."

We evaluated the contributions of aqueous‐phase chemistry to summertime urban SOA at two sites in New York City. The relative role of aqueous‐phase processing varied with chemical and environmental conditions, with evident daytime SOA enhancements (e.g., >1 μg/m3) during periods with relative humidities (RH) exceeding 65% and often higher temperatures. Oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) production was also sensitive to secondary inorganic aerosols, in part through their influence on aerosol liquid water. On average, high‐RH periods exhibited a 69% increase in less‐oxidized OOA production in Queens, NY. These enhancements coincided with southerly backward trajectories and greater inorganic aerosol concentrations, yet showed substantial intra‐city variability between Queens and Manhattan. The observed aqueous‐phase SOA production, even with historically low sulfate and nitrate aerosol loadings, highlights both opportunities and challenges for continued reductions in summertime PM2.5 in urban communities."

Here the national‐scale assessment of turbulence dissipation rate (ε) at flight cruising altitude (200 hPa) in China is conducted for the period from 2010 to 2022 using high‐resolution radiosonde measurements. Results show that both the intensity and frequency of turbulence exhibit a significant upward trend, particularly in the mid‐latitude regions. Furthermore, 12 other turbulence diagnostic parameters from ERA5 reanalysis show a similar increasing trend, corroborating the intensified trend in radiosonde‐derived turbulence. This more intensified and frequent turbulence is found to be closely associated with the increasing occurrence of jet streams, which could be attributed to the dynamic instability induced by the wind shear around jet streams. The findings help advance our understanding of turbulence trend and its underlying mechanism in the mid‐latitude regions under global warming."

H. Carroll;Andrew H. Manning;Kenneth H. Williams,The Role of Bedrock Circulation Depth and Porosity in Mountain Streamflow Response to Prolonged Drought,"Quantitative understanding is lacking on how the depth of active groundwater circulation in bedrock affects mountain streamflow response to a multi‐year drought. We use an integrated hydrological model to explore the sensitivity of a variety of streamflow metrics to bedrock circulation depth and porosity under a plausible extreme drought scenario lasting up to 5 years. Endmember depth versus hydraulic conductivity relationships and porosity values for fractured crystalline rock are simulated. With drought, a deeper circulation system with higher drainable porosity more effectively buffers minimum flow and significantly limits perennial stream loss in comparison to a shallow circulation system. Streamflow buffering is accomplished through extensive groundwater storage loss. However, deeper circulation systems experience prolonged recovery from drought in comparison to storage‐limited shallow systems. Research highlights the importance of characterizing the deeper bedrock hydrogeology in mountainous watersheds to better understand and predict drought impacts on stream ecosystem health and water resource sustainability."

Here, we investigate the petrogenesis of meladiorites from the ca. 200 Ma Cuijiu Igneous Complex in the eastern Gangdese Arc, southern Tibet. The meladiorites are pervasively intruded by normal diorite dykes and show geochemical affinities with high‐Mg intermediate igneous rocks, and their amphibole is characterized by low‐Mg core and high‐Mg rim. Our new data, together with published data, demonstrate that the meladiorites resulted from hybridization of an ultramafic cumulate mush (∼30%–∼50%) with percolating normal dioritic melts (∼50%–∼70%), and that dissolution‐crystallization and chemical diffusion dominated the hybridization. We propose that percolation of dioritic melts through ultramafic cumulate mushes is a viable way to form hybrid high‐Mg intermediate igneous rocks."

This study investigates the response of Changjiang subaqueous delta and its DM to sediment decline following the 2003 closure of the Three Gorges Dam. By analyzing temporal and spatial variations in 210Pbex profile styles, discrepancies between 210Pb and 137Cs sediment accumulation rates, and surface sediment grain sizes, we identified the onset of erosion at the DF shortly after 2003, which spread to the PD by 2009 and reached the northern DM by 2015. By tracking the burial depths of the 1963 137Cs peak, we found progressively lower erosion rates in newly eroded subzones primarily due to sediment redistribution. This study, leveraging historical radionuclides data, offers a valuable approach for monitoring erosion in areas lacking remote sensing detection and historical bathymetric data."

Spring 2024 witnessed a uniquely early southeastern opening, leading to basin‐wide sea ice extent falling 5σ $\sigma $ below the 1979–2023 average. Here, we show that a strong pressure gradient between high pressure over the Canadian Archipelago and low pressure to the south led to unusually strong and persistent winds from the east during May 2024. Consequently, the median sea ice opening date in the southeast was 31 days earlier than the 1979–2023 median, while sea ice opening in the west was delayed by 13 days. Early opening and warmer than average sea surface temperatures have extended the ice‐free period to 202 days in southeastern Hudson Bay, with potentially dramatic consequences on the local marine ecosystem and contributed to the record low Arctic‐wide sea ice extent by December 2024."

Although previous studies have explored ENSO's effects on the ISM, the reverse influence, particularly under global warming, remains unclear. This study examines the projected changes in the ISM's impacts on ENSO under the SSP5‐8.5 emission scenario using 34 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) that reasonably simulate the monsoon's effects on ENSO. A significant spread is found in the projections across the models, with approximately half of the models projecting an enhancing influence of ISM on ENSO, whereas the other half indicates a weakening effect. The intermodel spread is primarily associated with the projected changes in the strength of the feedback between precipitation and low‐level circulation over the tropical northwest Pacific, which is crucial for generating ISM‐induced anomalous circulation over the region. Models projecting an enhanced precipitation‐circulation feedback simulate larger ISM‐driven rainfall and circulation anomalies over the tropical northwest Pacific in a warmer climate, leading to more pronounced zonal wind anomalies near the equator along the southern side of the anomalous circulation and vice versa. As a result, the larger zonal wind anomalies caused by abnormal monsoons exert intensified effects on the subsequent ENSO evolution by significantly suppressing or amplifying the atmosphere‐ocean coupling processes related to ENSO development."

This study employs the HYSPLIT model, a Lagrangian atmospheric transport and dispersion model, along with satellite retrievals of SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ cloud properties to model the long range transport of the cloud. To reduce the uncertainty and complexity of modeling the near‐source behavior of the umbrella cloud, we utilize a data insertion technique that initializes the model at a downwind plume location. Satellite retrievals provide estimates of column mass loading and plume top height, though the plume top height may be uncertain above the tropopause. Additionally, the vertical mass distribution must be estimated by making assumptions about the cloud thickness. We use a back trajectory analysis to provide better estimations of plume top height and thickness. Our findings reveal that trajectory‐derived cloud top heights substantially exceeded satellite estimates, with 60% ranging between 20 and 40 km, compared to most satellite‐derived estimates being around 15 km. Long range 5‐day forecasts produced with data insertion using the revised cloud top heights and estimated thickness are compared with forecasts using retrieved cloud top heights and an assumed simple thickness of 1 km, and a control run initiated from the vent at the eruption start time. A qualitative comparison with satellite retrievals and data from ground based lidar stationed at Réunion Island shows the use of the back trajectory analysis significantly improves the forecast."

By fine-tuning Wnt signaling, Tex10 promotes spermatogenesis and PGC differentiation, offering potential therapeutic insights for treating male infertility. 
 Testis-specific transcript 10 (Tex10) is highly expressed in the testis, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and primordial germ cells (PGCs). We previously generated a Tex10 knockout mouse model demonstrating its critical roles in ESC pluripotency and preimplantation development. Here, using conditional knockout mice and dTAG-degron ESCs, we show Tex10 is required for spermatogenesis and ESC-to-PGCLC differentiation. Specifically, Tex10-null spermatocytes arrest at metaphase I, compromising round spermatid formation. Tex10 depletion and overexpression compromise and enhance ESC-to-PGCLC differentiation, respectively. Mechanistically, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that Tex10 depletion downregulates genes involved in pluripotency, PGC development, and spermatogenesis while upregulating genes promoting somatic programs. Chromatin occupancy study reveals that Tex10 binds to H3K4me3-marked promoters of Psmd3 and Psmd7, negative regulators of Wnt signaling, and activates their expression, thereby restraining Wnt signaling. Our study identifies Tex10 as a previously unappreciated factor in spermatogenesis and PGC development, offering potential therapeutic insights for treating male infertility.

Here, the authors find a photogenerated coherent phonon coupling to the electronic transition above the bandgap in the van der Waals ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI2. 
 A ferroelectric material often exhibits a soft transverse optical (TO) phonon mode which governs its phase transition. Charge coupling to this ferroelectric soft mode may further mediate emergent physical properties, including superconductivity and defect tolerance in semiconductors. However, direct experimental evidence for such coupling is scarce. Here we show that a photogenerated coherent phonon couples strongly to the electronic transition above the bandgap in the van der Waals (vdW) two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI2. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we identify this mode as the TO phonon responsible for ferroelectric order. This exclusive coupling occurs only with the above-gap electronic transition and is absent in the valence band as revealed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering. Our findings suggest a new role of the soft TO phonon mode in electronic and optical properties of ferroelectric semiconductors.

 Intensive efforts have been made to identify features that could serve as biomarkers of aging. Yet, drug-based interventions aimed at lessening the detrimental effects of getting older are lacking. This is largely attributable to tissue-specificity, sex-related differences, and to the difficulty of identifying actionable targets, which continues to pose a significant challenge. Here, we implement a bioinformatics approach revealing that aging-associated increase of the transmembrane Ectodysplasin-A2-Receptor is a prominent tissue-independent alteration occurring in humans and other species, and is particularly pronounced in models of accelerated aging. We show that strengthening of the Ectodysplasin-A2-Receptor signalling axis in myogenic precursors and differentiated myotubes suffices to trigger potent parainflammatory responses, mirroring aspects of aging-driven sarcopenia. Intriguingly, obesity, insulin-resistance, and aging-related comorbidities, such as type-2-diabetes, result in heightened levels of the Ectodysplasin-A2 ligand. Our findings suggest that targeting the Ectodysplasin-A2 surface receptor represents a promising pharmacological strategy to mitigate the development of aging-associated phenotypes.

 Acute liver failure (ALF) is a life-threatening condition caused by rapid hepatocyte death and impaired liver regeneration. Here we show that extracellular vesicles engineered to express Signal Regulatory Protein Alpha (SIRP-EVs), produced via a scalable 3D bioreactor process with high yield and purity, exhibit significant therapeutic potential by targeting damaged cells and promoting tissue repair. SIRP-EVs block CD47, a crucial inhibitory signal on necroptotic cells, to enhance macrophage-mediated clearance of dying hepatocytes. They also deliver regenerative cargo from mesenchymal stem cells, reprogramming macrophages to support liver regeneration. In male animal models, SIRP-EVs significantly reduce liver injury markers and improve survival, demonstrating their dual-function therapeutic efficacy. By integrating the resolution of necroptosis with regenerative macrophage reprogramming, SIRP-EVs represent a promising platform for restoring liver function. These findings support the development of EV-based in vivo macrophage reprogramming therapies for ALF and other inflammation-driven diseases, paving the way for the clinical application of engineered EV therapeutics.

 Our memory for the words we already know is best predicted by their associated meanings. However, the factors that influence whether we will remember a new word after we see it for the first time are unclear. We record memory performance for 2100 novel pseudowords across 1804 participants during a continuous recognition task. Participants show significant agreement across individuals for which novel words were memorable or forgettable, suggesting an intrinsic memorability for individual pseudowords. Pseudowords that are similar to low-frequency known words, with sparse orthographic neighbourhoods and rarely occurring letter pairs, are more memorable. Further, using intracranial recordings in 36 epilepsy patients we show a region in the anterior fusiform cortex that shows sensitivity to the memorability of these pseudowords. These results suggest that known words in our lexicon act as a scaffold for remembering novel word forms, with rare and unique known words providing the best support for novel word learning.

Here, the authors report an Ag/SnO2 interface to promote C2H4 adsorption and electrophilic *OH generation, leading to promoted production of ethylene oxide. 
 Direct electrochemical ethylene (C2H4) epoxidation with water (H2O) represents a promising approach for the production of value-added ethylene oxide (EO) in a sustainable way. However, the activity remains limited due to the sluggish activation of C2H4 and the stiff formation of *OH intermediate. This paper describes the design of a Ag/SnO2 electrocatalyst to achieve efficient electrochemical C2H4 epoxidation with a high faradaic efficiency of 39.4% for EO and a high selectivity of 91.5% at 25 mA/cm2 in a membrane electrode assembly. Results of in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra characterizations and computational calculations reveal that the Ag/SnO2 interface promotes C2H4 adsorption and activation to obtain *C2H4. Moreover, electrophilic *OH is generated on the catalyst surface through H2O dissociation, which further reacts with *C2H4 to facilitate the formation of *C2H4OH, contributing to the enhanced electrochemical epoxidation activity. This work would provide general guidance for designing catalysts for electrochemical olefin epoxidation through interface engineering.

 Scalable quantum photonic devices drive the development of compact sources of entangled photons, which are pivotal for quantum communication, computing, and cryptography. In this work, we present entangled photon pair generation in rhombohedral boron nitride (r-BN), leveraging its unique optical and structural properties. Unlike conventional hexagonal boron nitride, which suffers from reduced nonlinear response due to centrosymmetric structure in even-layered stacks, r-BN features interlayer ABC stacking and maintains robust in-plane inversion symmetry. These characteristics lead to highly efficient entangled photon generation. Our system demonstrates an entangled photon pair generation rate up to 8667 Hz/(mW·mm) and offers a tunable platform for Bell state generation by simply adjusting the pump polarization, without compromising the entanglement quality or generation efficiency. The polarization entangled state is measured with a fidelity up to 94%. This advancement not only marks a significant step towards ultrathin, scalable quantum devices but also establishes r-BN as a promising candidate for on-chip integrated quantum optical applications.

 The application and drug development of plant-derived natural products are often limited by their low abundance in medicinal plants and the lack of structural complexity and diversity. Herein, we design a concise enzyme cascade to efficiently produce natural and unnatural protoberberine alkaloids from cost-effective, readily available substrates. Through enzyme discovery and engineering, along with systematic optimization of the berberine bridge enzyme to address remaining manufacturing challenges in protoberberine alkaloid biosynthesis, the high production of drug Rotundine is achieved at an impressive gram-scale titer, demonstrating its industrial potential. More importantly, this cascade also enables the efficient biosynthesis of various unnatural halogenated protoberberine alkaloids. Thus, this work not only unlocks the potential of enzyme cascades in overcoming longstanding challenges in the efficient biosynthesis of plant-derived alkaloids, but also opens avenues to introduce structural complexity and diversity into alkaloids through synthetic biology, offering significant potential for drug development.

 How the shape characterization of the concentration-response relationships between particulate matter (PM) and all-cause mortality influences life expectancy (LE) gains remains unclear. Based on the Pearl River Cohort, the 2021 World Health Organization air quality guidelines, and an integrated comparative risk assessment framework, we identified sigmodal relationships between PM2.5, all-cause mortality, and LE reduction. A 10-unit increase in PM2.5 was associated with an excess mortality risk of 31.2% (95% uncertainty interval: 27.6–35.0%). Reducing PM2.5 to the guideline threshold of 5 μg/m3 could prevent 0.193 (0.175–0.212) million deaths, contributing to a 4.07–year (3.60–4.52) average LE gain. In contrast, PM2.5 reductions by 5.6% and 10% resulted in smaller LE gains of 0.33 (0.28–0.38) and 0.58 (0.49–0.67) years, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for the nonlinear relationship in air pollution control and provide essential incentives for tailoring sustainable plans to enhance population longevity."

 River waters are significant sources of atmospheric methane whose local emissions increase with river slope and turbulence. However, when integrated regionally, the amount of dissolved methane released to the atmosphere is uninfluenced by local changes in turbulence when no additional loss mechanisms are present. Here we tested the hypothesis that waterfalls enhance both local and regional atmospheric methane emissions if microbial methane oxidation is significant in river waters. Rates of net atmospheric emission and net aerobic methane oxidation were measured in river waters containing waterfalls across western New York revealing that methane oxidation can diminish atmospheric emissions when turbulence is less. However, at waterfalls, 88 ± 1% of the dissolved methane supersaturation was released to the atmosphere, increasing net methane emission rates substantially beyond oxidation (0.1–16.2 × 106 nM d-1 for waterfall emission; 10–39 nM d-1 for oxidation), and ultimately enhancing regional methane emissions by enabling dissolved methane to bypass an oxidative sink.

 The Mw 8.3 deep-focus earthquake beneath the Okhotsk Sea in 2013 provides an opportunity to study the source mechanism with regard to the specific geometry of the slab in the hypocentral region. It is also an opportunity to observe the impact of such a major event on the mechanical functioning of the subduction. Here we investigated the intricate rupture processes of the earthquake through back-projection using global stations. The earthquake can be divided into two stages, each consisting of multiple sub-events. Our teleseismic back-projection results suggest that the first stage of rupture occurred on multiple sub-horizontal planes and propagated to greater depths during the second stage. The main part of the rupture is consistent with transformational faulting within the metastable olivine wedge. The complex rupture process during the great earthquake can be put into perspective with the variations in the rate of plunge observed before and after the earthquake. While the earthquake was facilitated by a transient plunge a month before, it allowed a form of asperity to disappear through thermal runaway on a dipping plane and consequently led to an acceleration in the rate of subduction over the last 10 years.

 Accurate crop mapping plays a critical role in optimizing agricultural monitoring and ensuring food security. Although data-driven deep learning methods have demonstrated success in crop mapping with satellite image time series (SITS) data, their promising performances heavily depend on labeled training samples. Nevertheless, the difficulty of annotating crop types often results in labeled data scarcity, leading to a decline in the model’s performance. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a novel technique for crop mapping with limited labels. However, the existing SSL methods applied to SITS data typically explore masking solely on temporal dimension, which cannot guarantee strong spatial representation and therefore hinders the accurate prediction of complex crop fields. Furthermore, these methods sequentially extract spatial and temporal information without fully integrating information across different dimensions. In this study, we propose a spatiotemporal masking strategy for pre-training a SpatioTemporal Collaborative Learning Network (STCLN) to extract informative spatial and temporal representations from SITS data. Additionally, we design a SpatioTemporal Attention (STA) module in STCLN that integrates representations from spatial and temporal dimensions. The experimental results on two crop type mapping benchmarks encompassing various crop types demonstrate the outperformance of our proposed method. STCLN_wp outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with 6.49% higher mIoU on PASTIS dataset and 4.04% higher mIoU on MTLCC dataset. The ablation experiments on pre-training, masking strategies, and the STA module validate the effectiveness of our methodological design. Additionally, experiments conducted under varying sizes of the training set highlight the superior generalization ability of our method for crop type mapping in label-scarce situations.

 Knowledge graphs (KGs) have gained significant attention in the GIS community as a cutting-edge technology for linking heterogeneous and multimodal data sources. However, the efficiency of semantic querying of geospatial-temporal data in KGs remains a challenge. Graph databases excel at handling complex semantic associations but exhibit low efficiency in geospatial analysis tasks, such as topological analysis and geographic calculations, while relational databases excel at geospatial data storage and computation but struggle to efficiently process association analysis. To address this issue, we propose GraST, a geospatial-temporal semantic query optimization method that integrates property graphs and relational databases. GraST stores complete geospatial-temporal objects in a relational database (using built-in or extended spatial data engines), and employs spatiotemporal partitioning and indexing to enhance query efficiency. Simultaneously, GraST stores lightweight geospatial-temporal nodes in the graph database and links them to multi-granularity time tree and Geohash encoding nodes to enhance spatiotemporal aggregation capabilities. During query processing, user queries are broken down into graph semantic searches and geospatial calculations, pushed down to the graph and relational database for execution. Additionally, GraST adopts the two-phase commit protocol for cross-database data synchronization. We implemented a GraST prototype system by integrating PostGIS and Neo4j, and conducted performance evaluations and case studies on large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GraST shortens query response times by 1–2 orders of magnitude and offers flexible support for diverse geospatial-temporal semantic queries."
