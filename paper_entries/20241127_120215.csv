10.1088/1748-9326/ad8be0,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是NASA碳监测系统(CMS)中不确定性量化和传播的方法。CMS是一个涉及多个地球科学领域的综合系统，致力于监测和评估全球碳循环。论文中提出的框架旨在帮助CMS项目表征和有效地向科学和非科学用户传达数据产品中的不确定性。该框架考虑了不确定性的四个方面：来源、严重性、随机性与知识缺失，以及时空自相关性。通过案例研究和图形辅助，该框架力求清晰地报告不确定性，引导用户并调整预期。虽然论文没有直接讨论具体的空气质量监测技术或传感器类型，但其研究的不确定性量化方法对依赖卫星观测和大气成分分析的碳监测以及更广泛的大气环境遥感技术都具有重要意义。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Carbon dioxide', 'Satellite observation', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Uncertainty quantification', 'Data product']",Robert E Kennedy;Shawn P Serbin;Michael C Dietze;Hans-Erik Andersen;Chad Babcock;David F Baker;Molly E Brown;Kenneth J Davis;Laura Duncanson;Sha Feng;Andrew T Hudak;Junjie Liu;Paul L Patterson;Brett Raczka;Mark A Cochrane;Edil A Sepúlveda Carlo;Rodrigo Vargas,Characterizing and communicating uncertainty: lessons from NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System,"Navigating uncertainty is a critical challenge in all fields of science, especially when translating knowledge into real-world policies or management decisions. However, the wide variance in concepts and definitions of uncertainty across scientific fields hinders effective communication. As a microcosm of diverse fields within Earth Science, NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) provides a useful crucible in which to identify cross-cutting concepts of uncertainty. The CMS convened the Uncertainty Working Group (UWG), a group of specialists across disciplines, to evaluate and synthesize efforts to characterize uncertainty in CMS projects. This paper represents efforts by the UWG to build a heuristic framework designed to evaluate data products and communicate uncertainty to both scientific and non-scientific end users. We consider four pillars of uncertainty: origins, severity, stochasticity versus incomplete knowledge, and spatial and temporal autocorrelation. Using a common vocabulary and a generalized workflow, the framework introduces a graphical heuristic accompanied by a narrative, exemplified through contrasting case studies. Envisioned as a versatile tool, this framework provides clarity in reporting uncertainty, guiding users and tempering expectations. Beyond CMS, it stands as a simple yet powerful means to communicate uncertainty across diverse scientific communities."

Despite this, solid fuels remain the dominant form of cooking energy for rural households in developing countries. This study investigates the physical and mental health impacts of cooking energy choices by using endogenous switching models to address selection bias associated with cooking energy adoption and to distinguish the health impacts of different types of cooking energy. Using country-representative household survey data from rural China, our results indicate that adopting advanced forms of energy, not only enhances physical health in terms of reducing the rates of chronic diseases but also improves mental health. We further delve into the heterogenous impacts of advanced energy adoption across different groups and find that women, old adults, and economically disadvantaged groups are more likely to experience greater mental health benefits compared to their counterparts, while the opposite results are observed for the physical health. Additionally, we differentiate the health impacts by distinguishing between various energy types. This study provides insights for policy making aimed at improving public health and promoting health equality, contributing to efforts towards achieving sustainable development goals by prioritizing clean and efficient residential energy solutions."

Despite public controversy and extensive ecological research, little is known about how much PFH occurs on private and public lands in the U.S. Pacific West, or how practices changed with shifting forest policy and increasing area burned over the last three decades. We mapped PFH across 2.2 M burned hectares in California, Oregon, and Washington between 1986–2017 and used time series intervention analysis to compare trends in area, rate (% of burned area harvested), and mean patch size between private (0.5 M ha) and federal (1.6 M ha) forest land and across a gradient of burn severity. Harvest rates varied by ownership (4.9% federal, 18.6% private, 8.0% overall), and practices evolved and diverged over the study period. PFH area and rate declined across all ownerships in the mid-1990s during a period of reduced fire activity. As area burned increased between the early 2000s and late 2010s, PFH area rebounded and surpassed late-1980s levels, while rates remained relatively low. On federal lands, PFH practices shifted in the early-to-mid 1990s towards lower rates (10.3%–3.8%) and smaller patches (6.0–3.3 ha), following policy changes and increased litigation. PFH rates on federal lands decreased at all levels of burn severity, with the largest decreases (6.2%–1.2%) in forests with low tree mortality (i.e. fire refugia). Conversely, private PFH rates and mean patch sizes more than doubled in forests burned at very low-to-moderate severity. Our results highlight how PFH practices have shifted with policy, socio-economic pressure, and increasing area burned over 31 years in the Pacific West. A similar area of PFH is now dispersed over larger fires, with practices diverging substantially between ownerships."

However, comprehensive knowledge about microbial communities in response to rapid permafrost degradation at large (or interregional) scales remains elusive. In this meta-analysis, existing published data were utilized to identify the distributive and co-occurrence patterns of the microbiome in two interregional locations: the Qilian Mountains on the northeastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (NE-QTP) and the Xing’anling Mountains in Northeast China (NE-China). Both areas are situated in the marginal zone of large permafrost units. The results reveal that the rapidly degrading permafrost did not overshadow the regional biogeographic pattern of the microbial community. Instead, the results show some distinctive biogeographic patterns, as characterized by different groups of characteristic bacterial lineages in each of the two regions. Soil pH has emerged as a crucial controlling factor on the basis of the available environmental data. Network-based analyses suggest a generally high level of natural connectivity for bacterial networks on the NE-QTP; however, it collapses more drastically than that in NE-China if the environmental perturbations exceed the tipping point. These findings indicate that the biogeographic patterns of the bacterial community structure are not significantly altered by permafrost degradation. This research provides valuable insights into the development of more effective management methods for microbiomes in rapidly degrading permafrost."

The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by projecting changes in the flows of international migrants from medium-term population and climate change projections. We employ a bilateral gravity equation for emigration rates controlling for decadal weather averages of temperature, precipitation, droughts, and extreme precipitation in the origin countries. We use the parameter estimates of the gravity equation to estimate global, regional, and country-by-country emigration flows for several combinations of socio-economic development and climate change. Results indicate that global emigration flows are projected to increase to around 110 million in 2060 for SSP1 and RCP 4.5 and SSP5 and RCP 4.5; to 135 million for SSP5 and RCP 8.5; to 163 million for SSP3 and RCP 4.5.

In this study, we developed a novel emissions assessment framework encompassing three truck types, rail, and waterways at the provincial level. Using counterfactual scenarios during the ‘Clean Air Action’ (2013–2020), we quantitatively examined the co-benefits of freight mode shifts on mitigating CO2 and air pollutant emissions. Our findings indicate that nearly 6.4 Mt of CO2 emissions in the freight sector, equivalent to 2.4% of the total anthropogenic emissions (266.8 Mt, 95% CI: 192.1-320.0) in 2020, are avoided in China. Medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks contribute the most to this reduction over different phases. Rail transportation acted as the most effective mode for simultaneous emissions mitigation. However, while co-reductions are observed in HC (hydrocarbon, 3.9 Kt), CO (carbon monoxide, 83.6 Kt), and NOx (nitrogen oxides, 158.6 Kt) emissions, PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ⩽2.5 μm) emissions increased slightly due to increased share of the waterway freight. More than 80% of provinces in China benefited from freight mode shifts in carbon reductions during the second phase (2017–2020) due to the ambitious goals. To enhance freight mode shifts’ co-benefit, attention should emphasize controlling waterway emissions, expanding railway capacity, and optimizing energy structures. These strategies will amplify policy impact on reducing air pollutant emissions from freight transport and contribute to China’s journey towards carbon neutrality."

However, the mechanisms driving the interannual variability of these smoke aerosols are not well understood. By analyzing multi-source historical (1980–2020) smoke aerosols and meteorological reanalysis data, we explore the response of springtime smoke aerosol changes over the ICP to the interannual variability of the Indian Ocean (IO) sea-surface temperature (SST). Our findings show a positive correlation between the variability of springtime smoke aerosol loading and the preceding winter Southeast IO (SEIO) SST anomalies. Warmer SEIO SST tends to weaken the trans-equatorial flow (TEF) and the local Hadley circulation. This weakening of the TEF impedes cyclone development in the Bay of Bengal (BOB), thereby reducing southwest water vapor transport. Simultaneously, enhanced westerly winds over the northern BOB are blocked by the northwestern mountains of ICP. These winds converge and rise on the windward slopes, while descending on the leeward side with diminished humidity. Collectively, these dynamics lead to drier and hotter local meteorological conditions that favored fire-induced smoke aerosol emissions. Our findings highlight the role of the SEIO in regulating smoke aerosol variability and provide a scientific basis for developing strategies to manage smoke aerosol emissions over the ICP."

Despite notable progress, AI models still depend heavily on traditional NWP systems to generate analysis fields, a dependency that increases computational demands and might limit forecast accuracy. This study explored the integration of gridpoint statistical interpolation (GSI) with the Pangu-Weather AI forecasting model (GSI-Pangu), and assessed the potential for AI models to autonomously generate forecasts by leveraging mature data assimilation (DA) systems. Our experiments commenced by adopting ERA5 reanalysis data for the initial cycle, and then involved assimilation of simulated observations in subsequent cycles, spanning a month-long period. In our experiments, ERA5 reanalysis data were used exclusively to initialize the first forecast cycle, after which simulated observations were assimilated in subsequent cycles throughout the month-long period. Results demonstrated notable enhancements in forecast accuracy, with reductions in the root mean square error across various atmospheric variables compared with the results of a control experiment without DA. Additionally, the results highlighted GSI-Pangu’s ability to predict large-scale circulation patterns of extreme precipitation events, together with its effectiveness in driving regional models to accurately forecast precipitation intensity and distribution. Successful implementation of GSI within the Pangu-Weather framework underscores the transformative potential of hybrid forecasting systems, which merge conventional meteorological techniques with AI innovations, thereby facilitating accelerated adoption of AI in weather forecasting."

Prior studies predominantly correlated soil properties with wilting points and field water capacity; however, our novel framework investigates how soil properties drive ecosystem-level constraints on vegetation growth through soil water. In this study, a new paradigm was introduced for understanding the relationship between vegetation growth and soil moisture, characterized by a critical soil moisture (CSM) threshold that delineates the transition of vegetation into a moisture-limited state. This threshold declines sufficiently with soil desiccation. Our results highlight the pivotal role of soil properties in modulating this CSM threshold to meet the water demands of vegetation growth at the ecosystem-level. Globally, the regulation by soil properties ranges on the CSM threshold ranges from −0.18 cm3 cm−3 to +0.16 cm3 cm−3. The positive effect of soil properties in lowering this threshold for vegetation water demand significantly mitigated water constraints, thereby enhancing the vegetation growth. Notably, sandy soil textures were found to positively affect the lowering of CSM threshold in water-limited ecosystems. Our study provides valuable insights into the intricate role of soil properties in shaping global vegetation growth and proposes a new conceptual framework for their incorporation into the earth system models."

This approach provides a novel data-driven method to analyse the CLF adjustment by assessing the CLF sensitivity to Nd and numerous meteorological factors as well as the dependence of the Nd–CLF sensitivity on the meteorological conditions. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI) have a pronounced influence on the Earth's radiation budget but continue to pose one of the most substantial uncertainties in the climate system. Marine boundary-layer clouds (MBLCs) are particularly important since they cover a large portion of the Earth's surface. One of the biggest challenges in quantifying ACI from observations lies in isolating adjustments of cloud fraction (CLF) to aerosol perturbations from the covariability and influence of the local meteorological conditions. In this study, this isolation is attempted using 9 years (2011–2019) of near-global daily satellite cloud products in combination with reanalysis data of meteorological parameters. With cloud-droplet number concentration (Nd) as a proxy for aerosol, MBLC CLF is predicted by region-specific gradient boosting machine learning (ML) models. By means of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) regression values, CLF sensitivity to Nd and meteorological factors as well as meteorological influences on the Nd–CLF sensitivity are quantified. The regional ML models are able to capture, on average, 45 % of the CLF variability. Based on our statistical approach, global patterns of CLF sensitivity suggest that CLF is positively associated with Nd, particularly in the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition regions and the Southern Hemispheric midlatitudes. However, Nd retrieval bias may contribute to non-causality in these positive sensitivities, and hence they should be considered upper-bound estimates. CLF sensitivity to estimated inversion strength (EIS) is ubiquitously positive and strongest in tropical and subtropical regions topped by stratocumulus and within the midlatitudes. Globally, increased sea-surface temperature (SST) reduces CLF, particularly in stratocumulus regions. The spatial patterns of CLF sensitivity to horizontal wind components in the free troposphere may point to the impact of synoptic-scale weather systems and vertical wind shear on MBLCs. The Nd–CLF relationship is found to depend more on the selected thermodynamical variables than dynamical variables and in particular on EIS and SST. In the midlatitudes, a stronger inversion is found to amplify the Nd–CLF relationship, while this is not observed in the stratocumulus regions. In the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition regions, the Nd–CLF sensitivity is found to be amplified by higher SSTs, potentially pointing to Nd more frequently delaying this transition in these conditions. The expected climatic changes in EIS and SST may thus influence future forcings from the CLF adjustment. The novel data-driven framework, whose limitations are also discussed, produces a quantification of the response of MBLC CLF to aerosols, taking into account the covariations with meteorology."

Worden;Qindan Zhu,Opinion: Beyond global means – novel space-based approaches to indirectly constrain the concentrations of and trends and variations in the tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH),"Trace gases emitted to or formed within the atmosphere may be chemically or physically removed from the atmosphere. One trace gas, the hydroxyl radical (OH), is responsible for initiating the chemical removal of many trace gases, including some greenhouse gases. Despite its importance, scientists have not been able to adequately measure OH. In this opinion piece, we discuss promising new methods to indirectly constrain OH using satellite data of trace gases that control the abundance of OH. 
 The hydroxyl radical (OH) plays a central role in tropospheric chemistry, as well as influencing the lifetimes of some greenhouse gases. Because of limitations in our ability to observe OH, we have historically relied on indirect methods to constrain its concentrations, trends, and variations but only as annual global or annual semi-hemispheric averages. Recent methods demonstrated the feasibility of indirectly constraining tropospheric OH on finer spatio-temporal scales using satellite observations as proxies for the photochemical drivers of OH (e.g., nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, isoprene, water vapor, ozone). We found that there are currently reasonable satellite proxies to constrain up to about 75 % of the global sources of tropospheric OH and up to about 50 % of the global sinks. With additional research and investment in observing various volatile organic compounds, there is potential to constrain an additional 10 % of the global sources and 30 % of the global sinks. We propose steps forward for the development of a comprehensive space-based observing strategy, which will improve our ability to indirectly constrain OH on much finer spatio-temporal scales than previously achieved. We discuss the strengths and limitations of such an observing strategy and potential improvements to current satellite instrument observing capabilities that would enable better constraint of OH. Suborbital observations (i.e., data collected from non-satellite platforms such as aircraft, balloons, and buildings) are required to collect information difficult to obtain from space and for validation of satellite-based OH estimates; therefore, they should be an integral part of a comprehensive observing strategy."

We used hourly PurpleAir data and hourly reference-grade PM2.5 data from the EPA Air Quality System database from January 2021 to August 2023. Compared with the Barkjohn model, we found improved performance metrics, with error metrics decreasing by 16 %–23 % when applying a multilinear regression model with RH and temperature as predictive variables. We also tested a novel semi-supervised clustering method and found that a nonlinear effect between PM2.5 and RH emerges around  RH of 50 %, with slightly greater accuracy. Therefore, our results suggested that a clustering approach might be more accurate in high humidity conditions to capture the nonlinearity associated with PM particle hygroscopic growth."

It is shown that current methods can be calibrated to significantly enhance their performance for severe-hail detection. This study establishes the foundation for the solution of a more complex problem: the estimation of the maximum size of hailstones on the ground using deep learning applied to radar data. 
 Radar has consistently been proven to be the most reliable source of information for the remote detection of hail within storms in real time. Currently, existing hail detection techniques have limited ability to clearly distinguish storms that produce severe hail from those that do not. This often results in a prohibitive number of false alarms that hamper real-time decision-making. This study utilises convolutional neural network (CNN) models trained on dual-polarisation radar data to detect severe-hail occurrence on the ground. The morphology of the storms is studied by leveraging the capabilities of a CNN. Two datasets of images of 60 km × 60 km containing 19 different radar-derived features are built. The first is created from severe-hail cases (≥2 cm), and the second is obtained from rain or small-hail cases (rain or hail <2 cm) selected with the help of a cell identification algorithm above densely populated areas with no hail reports. After a tuning phase on the CNN architecture and its input size, the CNN is trained to output one probability of severe hail on the ground per image of 30 km × 30 km. A test set of 1396 images between 2018 and 2023 demonstrates that the CNN method outperforms state-of-the-art methods according to various metrics. A feature importance study indicates that existing radar-based hail proxies as input features are beneficial to the CNN, particularly the maximum estimated size of hail (MESH). The study demonstrates that many of the existing hail proxies can be adjusted using a threshold value and a threshold area to achieve better performance. Finally, the output of 10 fitted CNN models in inference mode on a hail event is shown."

Barrett,Mapping rangeland health indicators in eastern Africa from 2000 to 2022,"This paper uses machine learning and linear unmixing to produce rangeland health indicators: Landsat time series of land cover classes and vegetation fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare ground in arid and semi-arid Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia. This represents the first multi-decadal Landsat-resolution dataset specifically designed for mapping and monitoring rangeland health in the arid and semi-arid rangelands of this portion of eastern Africa. 
 Tracking environmental change is important to ensure efficient and sustainable natural resources management. Eastern Africa is dominated by arid and semi-arid rangeland systems, where extensive grazing of livestock represents the primary livelihood for most people. Despite several mapping efforts, eastern Africa lacks accurate and reliable high-resolution maps of rangeland health necessary for many management, policy, and research purposes. Earth observation data offer the opportunity to assess spatiotemporal dynamics in rangeland health conditions at much higher spatial and temporal coverage than conventional approaches, which rely on in situ methods, while also complementing their accuracy. Using machine learning classification and linear unmixing, we produced rangeland health indicators – Landsat-based time series from 2000 to 2022 at 30 m spatial resolution for mapping land cover classes (LCCs) and vegetation fractional cover (VFC; including photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare ground) – two important data assets for deriving metrics of rangeland health in eastern Africa. Due to the scarcity of in situ measurements in the large, remote, and highly heterogeneous landscape, an algorithm was developed to combine high-resolution WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellite imagery at < 2 m resolutions with a limited set of ground observations to generate reference labels across the study region using visual photo-interpretation. The LCC algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 0.856 when comparing predictions to our validation dataset comprised of a mixture of in situ observations and visual photo-interpretation from high-resolution imagery, with a kappa of 0.832; the VFC returned a R2=0.795, p < 2.2×10-16, and normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE) = 0.123 when comparing predicted bare-ground fractions to visual photo-interpreted high-resolution imagery. Our products represent the first multi-decadal Landsat-resolution dataset specifically designed for mapping and monitoring rangelands health in eastern Africa including Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, covering a total area of 745 840 km2.

However, such a retrofitting approach may also pose potential environmental and health risks, even aggravating regional disparities. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the associated risks of Biomass and Coal Cofiring Retrofit (BCCR) in China. We find that air pollutants such as SO2, PM2.5, and NOx will increase by an average of 27.9, 38.04, and 42.79% respectively compared to the scenario with no BCCR. The national-wide PM2.5 concentration-related premature mortalities in scenarios with BCCR are projected to increase by 23.53% on average in 2030. Moreover, the Highest-20% of provinces with higher health risks (also health vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children concentrated area) are 19 times greater than that in the Lowest-20% group. Results suggest that implementing a Targeted Pollution Control strategy for areas with higher health risks would be an economical and effective way to reduce the total pollutants emissions and mitigate the regional disparities in health risks. Our research proposes stringent pollution control measures on biomass and coal cofiring retrofit in advance in regions with the utmost necessity to facilitate a fair transition toward clean energy."

Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) can form during the atmospheric degradation of precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), N-alkylated perfluoroalkane sulfonamides (FASAs), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Since PFCAs and PFSAs will readily undergo wet deposition, snow and ice cores are useful for studying PFAS in the Arctic atmosphere. In this study, 36 PFAS were detected in surface snow around the Arctic island of Spitsbergen during January–August 2019 (i.e., 24 h darkness to 24 h daylight), indicating widespread and chemically diverse contamination, including at remote high elevation sites. Local sources meant some PFAS had concentrations in snow up to 54 times higher in Longyearbyen, compared to remote locations. At a remote high elevation ice cap, where PFAS input was from long-range atmospheric processes, the median deposition fluxes of C2–C11 PFCAs, PFOS and HFPO–DA (GenX) were 7.6–71 times higher during 24 h daylight. These PFAS all positively correlated with solar flux. Together this suggests seasonal light is important to enable photochemistry for their atmospheric formation and subsequent deposition in the Arctic. This study provides the first evidence for the possible atmospheric formation of PFOS and GenX from precursors."

We performed a global, multiyear study in over 180 wetlands across 28 countries and 8 macroclimates using standardized litter as measures of “recalcitrant” (rooibos tea) and “labile” (green tea) organic matter (OM) decomposition. Freshwater wetlands and tidal marshes had the highest tea mass remaining, indicating a greater potential for carbon preservation in these ecosystems. Recalcitrant OM decomposition increased with elevated temperatures throughout the decay period, e.g., increase from 10 to 20 °C corresponded to a 1.46-fold increase in the recalcitrant OM decay rate constant. The effect of elevated temperature on labile OM breakdown was ecosystem-dependent, with tidally influenced wetlands showing limited effects of temperature compared with freshwater wetlands. Based on climatic projections, by 2050 wetland decay constants will increase by 1.8% for labile and 3.1% for recalcitrant OM. Our study highlights the potential for reduction in belowground OM in coastal and inland wetlands under increased warming, but the extent and direction of this effect at a large scale is dependent on ecosystem and OM characteristics. Understanding local versus global drivers is necessary to resolve ecosystem influences on carbon preservation in wetlands."

The landscape of satellite instruments with some methane point-source quantification capabilities is growing. Combining information across available sensor platforms could be pivotal for understanding trends and uncertainties in source-level emissions. However, to effectively combine information across sensors of varying performance levels, the probability of detection (POD) for all instruments must be well characterized, which is time-consuming and costly, especially for satellites. In August 2023, we timed methane-sensing aerial surveys from the Global Airborne Observatory (GAO) to overlap with observations from the NASA Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT). We show how these coincident observations can be used to determine and verify the detection limits of EMIT and to develop and test a multisensor persistence framework. Under favorable conditions, the 90% POD at 3  for EMIT is 1060. We further derive a Bayesian model to infer probabilistically whether nondetected emissions were truly off, and we validate and show how this model can be used to assess the intermittency of emissions with GAO and EMIT. Time-averaged emission rates from persistent sources can be underestimated if POD is not characterized and if differences in POD across multisensor frameworks are not properly accounted for."

Traditional water quality assessments predominantly rely on chemical analysis, which inadequately capture the collective effects of diverse chemical mixtures released during storm events. We applied effect-based methods (EBM) to detect arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity, estrogenic activity, neurotoxicity and oxidative stress response in water samples from an urban tributary during a storm event and compared it with base flow conditions. AhR activity and neurotoxicity peaked during the storm event, with neurotoxicity exceeding the interim effect-based trigger value and showing a high specificity of effect. This suggests unacceptable water quality during the storm event. Conversely, estrogenic activity was relatively low, and there was little difference between base flow conditions and the storm event. The absence of wastewater, industrial and agricultural inputs in the catchment suggests that the observed bioactivity was related to road runoff, specifically from two adjacent major motorways. The effects on AhR and neurotoxicity were linearly correlated with detected concentrations of 15 tire additive chemicals from an accompanying study. This study demonstrates that EBM provides complementary information to chemical analysis for water quality monitoring and that there is an increased chemical pressure on receiving water bodies during rain events in urban areas."

This interaction results in ionosphere structuring and variability that pose major challenges for accurate ionosphere prediction for global navigation satellite system (GNSS) related applications and space weather research. The ionospheric structuring and variability are often probed using the total electron content (TEC) and its relative perturbations (dTEC). Among dTEC variations observed at high latitudes, a unique modulation pattern has been linked to magnetospheric ultra‐low‐frequency (ULF) waves, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here using magnetically conjugate observations from the THEMIS spacecraft and a ground‐based GPS receiver at Fairbanks, Alaska, we provide direct evidence that these dTEC modulations are driven by magnetospheric electron precipitation induced by ULF‐modulated whistler‐mode waves. We observed peak‐to‐peak dTEC amplitudes reaching ∼ ${\sim} $ 0.5 TECU (1 TECU is equal to 106 ${10}^{6}$ electrons/m2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{2}$) with modulations spanning scales of ∼ ${\sim} $ 5–100 km. The cross‐correlation between our modeled and observed dTEC reached ∼ ${\sim} $ 0.8 during the conjugacy period but decreased outside of it. The spectra of whistler‐mode waves and dTEC also matched closely at ULF frequencies during the conjugacy period but diverged outside of it. Our findings elucidate the high‐latitude dTEC generation from magnetospheric wave‐induced precipitation, addressing a significant gap in current physics‐based dTEC modeling.

Miner,Storm Dynamics Control Sedimentation and Shelf‐Bay‐Marsh Sediment Exchange Along the Louisiana Coast,"Hurricanes can benefit wetland accretion by augmenting the delivery of mineral sediment, an essential process allowing marshes to offset submergence during rising sea levels. Using Hurricane Gustav (2008, Louisiana) as a control, we examined eight synthetic storms with varying characteristics (track, speed, intensity, size) to evaluate sediment exchange between the inner shelf and bay and bay‐to‐marsh interfaces. All storms showed net landward sediment exchange from the inner shelf to the bay to the marsh—storms with closer proximity, higher intensity, and slower forward speed positively correlated with net sediment exchange; storm size had little impact. Except for slow‐moving storms (½ speed of Gustav), our analyses suggest that most hurricane scenarios cause net bay erosion, because more sediment is conveyed to landward wetlands than is replenished from erosion of the inner shelf. Our results suggest that the ongoing deepening of the bay will likely worsen because of rising sea levels."

While mathematical models have usually focused on constant discharges—a reasonable and widely adopted approach for long‐term considerations—we show that varying flows strongly affect the short‐term planimetric evolution of meanders, before the cutoff occurrence. In particular, flow variability slows down the meanders' dynamics while does not significantly influence the wavelength selection. We support our arguments with numerical simulations and theoretical (linear and nonlinear) analyses, showing that an interplay between out‐of‐phase river geometry and flow is responsible for the meander‐dynamics slowdown. Our results suggest that accounting for flow variability is critical in assessing yearly to decadal meander dynamics with important implications for river engineering and management strategies."

To examine heat flux dynamics in glacial fjords, we run an 8‐year realistic numerical simulation of Milne Fiord, validated with observations. We leverage the duration and spatial resolution of the simulation to calculate ice melt, offshore density variations, average fjord temperature, and heat fluxes at different locations along‐fjord. Correlations between these quantities reveal that heat fluxes near the grounding line (<5 km) are linked to buoyancy‐driven circulation while offshore forcing is linked to heat fluxes along the remainder of the fjord. Comparison to a simulation with constant offshore boundary conditions reveals that offshore forcing enhances the exchange between the coastal shelf and the fjord, increasing glacier melt rates by 18%. Including offshore forcing into numerical and box models of glacial fjords is essential for accurate melting predictions."

Here, we redefine solar drought events by considering supply demand imbalance in solar power. Observation and multi‐model simulations reveal an anthropogenic exacerbation of global solar drought frequency in the past three decades. Moreover, compared to the pathway SSP2‐4.5, the carbon neutrality pathway SSP1‐2.6 can mitigate the increasing frequency and severity of solar droughts by 60% and 63% in the 2090s, respectively.

Its intrinsic mechanism remains unclear. Based on a nonlinear theoretical model and reanalysis data sets during 1979–2023, we find similar qualitative and quantitative relationships, termed pitchfork‐like (PL) relationships, between the 850‐hPa Ural geopotential height anomaly in June, July, and January, and local soil moisture, snow depth water equivalent, and snow cover in the preceding months, respectively. These months are near the crest and trough of the annual cycle when surface forcing factors vary slowly. These nonlinear PL relationships reveal that the interannual Ural atmospheric variability in June and July (January) is intrinsically a transition between three (two) quasi‐equilibrium states. Moreover, when each forcing factor exceeds its critical threshold, the positive and negative anomaly quasi‐equilibrium states may occur with equal probability, implying a low predictability."

A decision tree algorithm designed to be adaptable to any particle imaging probe, thus enabling the creation of habit size distributions over a size range larger than that of any probe on its own, is used to classify ice crystals imaged by three airborne cloud probes in mid‐latitude winter cyclones during the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast‐Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) field campaign. Crystals are sorted into seven habit classes based on their morphological properties: sphere, column/needle, plate, graupel, dendrite, aggregate, and irregular. Although adaptability was its primary goal, the algorithm was found to be moderately skillful for identifying idealized habit images. Quantitative tests of the algorithm's adaptability displayed mixed results, as Two‐Dimensional Stereo Probe (2DS) classifications showed moderate correlation with Particle Habit Imaging and Polar Scattering Probe (PHIPS) classifications, but only weak correlation with High Volume Precipitation Spectrometer (HVPS) classifications. The algorithm was applied to random sets of images from each probe in a case study of a mesoscale snow band sampled on 7 February 2020. In the case study, qualitative analysis of particle images revealed general agreement on classifications among the probes, supporting the algorithm's applicability to multiple cloud probes. Most classifications appeared correct upon manual inspection, suggesting that in practical use, the algorithm is reasonably able to classify non‐idealized images."

In this study, we investigate the influence of wildfires on atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) variability through a comparative analysis of observations from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Our focus is on the North American domain, aiming to understand the differences among these products. In general, all instruments show excellent agreement under typical atmospheric CO conditions. However, notable discrepancies were observed in the CO data from the three sensors, particularly in regions with elevated CO total column (TC) values. IASI and TROPOMI consistently showed higher CO values over the western U.S. compared to MOPITT. During the fire episodes, we found that the IASI retrievals suggested higher CO abundances near the surface than the MOPITT thermal infrared retrievals that are probably the result of the differences in the covariance matrices used in IASI and MOPITT retrievals. We also found that the high IASI and TROPOMI CO observations over the western U.S. coincided with high values of the TROPOMI aerosol index (AI), suggesting the presence of absorbing aerosols. The analysis exhibited better agreement between TROPOMI and MOPITT CO TC when the AI values were low. Our results suggest that appropriate quality filtering should be employed when analyzing pollution events with these data. In particular, utilizing the AI for quality filtering may be useful when analyzing extreme pollution events with these satellite products."

Accurate quantification of BB emissions is vital for assessing its environmental and climate impacts. However, there are still large uncertainties in current BB emission inventories due to poorly characterized emission rates under different combustion states. The fixed emission factor (EF) instead of varying EF associated with different combustion efficiencies may be the reason for the bias. Here, based on satellite‐retrieved carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), the modified combustion efficiency (MCE) is derived for fire‐prone regions in Africa. The monthly and inter‐annual variability of MCE shows a good correlation with meteorological variables such as relative humidity. Therefore, variable EF was established based on its statistical relationship with MCE for different fire‐emitted species. Application of such MCE‐dependent EF in the global climate‐chemistry model can greatly improve the performance of wildfire smoke pollution during the fire season, indicated by an increase of 31% in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and a 50% reduction in normalized mean bias compared with AOD observations. The study elucidates the critical role of meteorology in BB emission estimates and highlights the importance of implementing a dynamic fire emission inventory in response to meteorological conditions."

High cumulative anomalies of the first or last humid heatwaves were found in the mid‐ and high‐latitude regions. Average difference between all humid heatwaves and the first humid heatwaves in cumulative anomalies increased steadily at stations north of 35°N. At regional scales, South East Asia had become the most prominent area with intensification of intra‐annual onset and end of humid heatwaves and will experience more frequent extreme events by 2100.

 Repair of double-stranded breaks generated by CRISPR/Cas9 is highly dependent on the flanking DNA sequence. To learn about interactions between DNA repair and target sequence, we measure frequencies of over 236,000 distinct Cas9-generated mutational outcomes at over 2800 synthetic target sequences in 18 DNA repair deficient mouse embryonic stem cells lines. We classify the outcomes in an unbiased way, finding a specialised role for Prkdc (DNA-PKcs protein) and Polm in creating 1 bp insertions matching the nucleotide on the protospacer-adjacent motif side of the break, a variable involvement of Nbn and Polq in the creation of different deletion outcomes, and uni-directional deletions dependent on both end-protection and end-resection. Using our dataset, we build predictive models of the mutagenic outcomes of Cas9 scission that outperform the current standards.

 Silver deposits have long been considered to form due to the direct precipitation of silver minerals from aqueous fluids, in which the metal is transported as chloride and/or bisulfide complexes. Ultra-high-grade silver ores have silver contents up to tens of weight-percent in the form of silver sulfides and native silver. Ore-forming fluids of most silver deposits, however, typically contain low silver contents of parts per million silver. The challenge is to explain how fluids with such low concentrations of silver can form ultra-high-grade silver ores. Here, we present direct mineralogical evidence from natural samples showing that the high-grade silver ores form from the aggregation of silver sulfide nanoparticles through intermediate microparticles and dendrites to acanthite crystals. Native silver grows from silver sulfides via solid-state silver ion aggregation. This study traces the formation of silver sulfides from their nanoparticulate precursors, thereby providing insights into the genesis of ultra-high-grade silver ores in a variety of metallogenic settings.

Here, Gurung et al show that a noncollinear antiferromagnets can exhibit an extremely high degree of spin polarization over a large area of its Fermi surface and propose using this feature for the development of antiferromagnetic magnetic tunnel junctions. 
 Ferromagnets with high spin polarization are known to be valuable for spintronics—a research field that exploits the spin degree of freedom in information technologies. Recently, antiferromagnets have emerged as promising alternative materials for spintronics due to their stability against magnetic perturbations, absence of stray fields, and ultrafast dynamics. For antiferromagnets, however, the concept of spin polarization and its relevance to the measured electrical response are elusive due to nominally zero net magnetization. Here, we define an effective momentum-dependent spin polarization and reveal an unexpected property of many noncollinear antiferromagnets to exhibit nearly 100% spin polarization in a broad area of the Fermi surface. This property leads to the emergence of an extraordinary tunneling magnetoresistance (ETMR) effect in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs). As a representative example, we predict that a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3GaN exhibits nearly 100% spin-polarized states that can efficiently tunnel through low-decay-rate evanescent states of perovskite oxide SrTiO3 resulting in ETMR as large as 104%. Our results uncover hidden functionality of material systems with noncollinear spin textures and open new perspectives for spintronics.

These population cycles reveal synchronicity with cycles in climate stability, which in turn were possibly driven by variations in solar activity. 
 Human population dynamics and their drivers are not well understood, especially over the long term and on large scales. Here, we estimate demographic growth trajectories from 9 to 3 ka BP across the entire globe by employing summed probability distributions of radiocarbon dates. Our reconstruction reveals multicentennial growth cycles on all six inhabited continents, which exhibited matching dominant frequencies and phase relations. These growth oscillations were often also synchronised with multicentennial variations in solar activity. The growth cycle for Europe, reconstructed based on  >91,000 radiocarbon dates, was backed by archaeology-derived settlement data and showed only a weak correlation with mean climate states, but a strong correlation with the stability of these states. We therefore suggest a link between multicentennial variations in solar activity and climate stability. This stability provided more favourable conditions for human subsistence success, and seems to have induced synchrony between regional growth cycles worldwide.

Here, authors report a noninvasive strategy of magnetoelectrochemical synergistic activation to realize ordered cation rearrangement and recovery battery capacity. 
 Nickel-rich layered oxides are one of the most promising positive electrode active materials for high-energy Li-ion batteries. Unfortunately, the practical performance is inevitably circumscribed by the structural deterioration deriving from the Ni/Li antisite disorder, leading to severe capacity loss and life attenuation. Herein, we propose an economical and facile rejuvenation strategy by employing the magneto-electrochemical synergistic activation targeting the positive electrode in assembled Li-ion batteries. This approach induces a transition of Ni3+ from high-spin to low-spin, reducing the super-exchange interaction of Ni-O-transition metal (TM). Meanwhile, electrochemical reaction drives Li+ from the host material and promotes Ni3+ to reoccupy TM layer, recovering intrinsic Li site and extending cycle life. The strategy demonstrates that low-quality positive electrodes can be converted to high-quality ones. Notably, the method can revitalize an aged Li-ion pouch cell (SiC||NCM811, 8 Ah nominal capacity) via optimizing cation occupancy and increase its capacity by 10% from 6.49 to 7.14 Ah at 1 C, illustrating the benefits of the upcycling process.

As its origin, the authors propose the presence of a hidden Kondo-type scattering process between itinerant electrons and localized moments in this magnetic Weyl semimetal. 
 In Landau’s celebrated Fermi liquid theory, electrons in a metal obey the Wiedemann–Franz law at the lowest temperatures. This law states that electron heat and charge transport are linked by a constant L0, i.e., the Sommerfeld value of the Lorenz number (L). Such relation can be violated at elevated temperatures where the abundant inelastic scattering leads to a reduction of the Lorenz number (L < L0). Here, we report a rare case of remarkably enhanced Lorenz number (L > L0) discovered in the magnetic topological semimetal NdAlSi. Measurements of the transverse electrical and thermal transport coefficients reveal that the Hall Lorenz number Lxy in NdAlSi starts to deviate from the canonical value far above its magnetic ordering temperature. Moreover, Lxy displays strong nonmonotonic temperature and field dependence, reaching its maximum value close to 2L0 in an intermediate parameter range. Further analysis excludes charge-neutral excitations as the origin of enhanced Lxy. Alternatively, we attribute it to the Kondo-type elastic scattering off localized 4f electrons, which creates a peculiar energy distribution of the quasiparticle relaxation time. Our results provide insights into the perplexing transport phenomena caused by the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom.

 Several Earth system components are at a high risk of undergoing rapid, irreversible qualitative changes or “tipping” with increasing climate warming. It is therefore necessary to investigate the feasibility of arresting or even reversing the crossing of tipping thresholds. Here, we study feedback control of an idealized energy balance model (EBM) for Earth’s climate, which exhibits a “small icecap” instability responsible for a rapid transition to an ice-free climate under increasing greenhouse gas forcing. We develop an optimal control strategy for the EBM under different forcing scenarios to reverse sea-ice loss while minimizing costs. Control is achievable for this system, but the cost nearly quadruples once the system tips. While thermal inertia may delay tipping, leading to an overshoot of the critical forcing threshold, this leeway comes with a steep rise in requisite control once tipping occurs.

 Ecosystem restoration will increase following the ambitious international targets, which calls for a rigorous evaluation of restoration effectiveness. Here, we present results from a long-term before-after control-impact experiment on the restoration of forestry-drained boreal peatland ecosystems. Our data comprise 151 sites, representing six ecosystem types. Species-level vegetation sampling has been conducted before, two, five, and ten years after restoration. With joint species distribution modelling, we show that, on average, not restoring leads to further degradation, but restoration stops and reverses this trend. The variation in restoration outcomes largely arises from ecosystem types: restoration of nutrient-poor ecosystems has a higher probability of failure. Yet, the ten-year study period is insufficient to capture the restoration effects in slow-recovering ecosystems. Altogether, restoration can effectively halt the biodiversity loss of degraded ecosystems, although ecosystem attributes affect the outcome. This variability in outcomes underlies the need for evidence-based prioritization of restoration efforts across ecosystems.

 Due to policies such as groundwater extraction restrictions, water diversion, and water replenishment, groundwater levels in the Beijing Plain have generally risen. This has effectively alleviated ground subsidence, with some regions even experiencing uplift. Under these new water conditions, strata deformation also shows spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and the overlap of these multiple deformation patterns hinders the interpretation of ground deformation. In this study, we employed Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneous deformation patterns and their influencing factors in the Beijing Plain. We utilized Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to effectively separate overlapping ground deformation patterns from InSAR-derived ground surface deformation. Four ground deformation patterns—approximately linear subsidence, approximately linear uplift, decelerating subsidence, and periodic deformation—were extracted. Their overlapping status and influencing factors were explored based on external hydrogeological data. Approximately linear subsidence represents the continuous compression of deep strata in areas with severe subsidence. Approximately linear uplift represents the rebound of shallow strata caused by water replenishment. Periodic deformation represents the ground’s response to precipitation and irrigation pumping. The ICA results benefit the estimation of the time lag between groundwater rise and strata rebound in the Beijing Plain, as well as the estimation of the increase in groundwater storage capacity in the Miyun-Huairou-Shunyi region. This study provides a new perspective for extracting deformation information from InSAR observations, gaining a deeper understanding of deformation patterns related to hydrogeological phenomena, and assessing the effectiveness of groundwater management and land subsidence control policies."

 Accurate geolocation using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is essential for safe and long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flights. However, GNSS systems are susceptible to blockages, jamming, and spoofing attacks. Localization using onboard cameras and satellite images provides a promising solution for UAVs operating in GNSS-denied environments. In this paper, we developed a novel UAV visual localization system for GNSS-denied situations, both day and night, that integrates image matching, visual odometry (VO), and terrain-weighted constraint optimization. First, an effective map management strategy is designed for satellite image chunking, real-time scheduling, and merging. Then, a 2D–3D geo-registration method, combining Bidirectional Homologous Points Search, is introduced to obtain accurate 3D virtual control points for UAV absolute localization. Lastly, a position estimation and optimization method, integrating the sliding window with terrain weighting constraints, is proposed to control position error accumulation and reduce position drift. Twenty experiments were conducted in typical and complex scenarios to validate our system’s resilience to altitude changes, trajectory variations, and rolling terrain. Our system demonstrated drift-free and viewpoint-robust, maintaining stability even in feature-poor environments and seasonal variations. It does not require loop closure, allowing for re-localization after positioning failures. Additionally, we utilized thermal infrared images to demonstrate the system’s performance in night-time conditions. With a Mean Absolute Error of less than 7 m, it can be a powerful complement to GNSS in the event of GNSS-Denied environments.

 The SouthEastern Aerosol Research CHaracterization (SEARCH) program examined air quality at 6 sites across the southeastern United States. The Jefferson Street site in Atlanta operated from 1998 to 2016 with the collection and chemical characterization of PM2.5 that provide data suitable for source identification and apportionment with a sufficiently long time series to permit effective trend analyses. Although there have been analyses of parts of these data, there is no prior comprehensive analysis relating the changes in source-specific PM2.5 with policy implementations and economic drivers. The major sources were secondary sulfate, traffic sources (spark- and compression-ignition vehicles), and secondary nitrate. Several local industrial sources were identified primarily assigned as metal working, but likely including a nearby bus maintenance garage. A combined biomass burning and pyrolyzed organic carbon factor was resolved that reflected the extensive prescribed burning that occurred in the southeastern United States to control larger wildfires and that increased in recent years. The major trends were reductions in concentrations of sulfate and nitrate likely as a result of policies to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants and mobile sources. Gasoline vehicle contributions uniformly declined, but there was a period of increase diesel concentrations in the middle of the study period for which the cause is unknown."

 The urgency of the global climate crisis necessitates advanced monitoring of greenhouse gases, with an emphasis on capturing their spatial and temporal variability. This study explores techniques to enhance plume detection and concentration measurements using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring at point sources, specifically at an incineration stack. Through preliminary site investigations, our approach employed strategically designed flight paths and an autopilot system to optimize flight operations within the constraints of limited flight time due to battery capacity. We combined a UAV-mounted anemometer with a plume rise model to localize the plume center at a distance of 30 m from the stack center and evaluated its performance by comparing the model-based estimations at different altitudes and angular directions with the observation results. The comparison demonstrated that the results obtained by localizing the plume center using a plume rise model and a UAV-mounted anemometer aligned well with observations based on CO2 concentration analysis. The comparative analysis showed a RMSE of 8.44 m and a MAE of 7.26 m for altitude, and a RMSE of 32.31∘ and a MAE of 25.78∘ for angular direction. Furthermore, we assessed the effectiveness of hovering UAV flights, in which a UAV remains stationary at a fixed point in the air, compared to non-hovering flights in capturing pollutant concentration. While both methods performed similarly in detecting the plume center, non-hovering flights underestimated the CO2 concentration due to insufficient time for measurement despite a sensor response time of less than three seconds. Overall, our proposed hybrid monitoring strategy integrates non-hovering and hovering flights, enhancing both plume detection efficiency and concentration measurement accuracy at point sources."

 Zaozhuang, located at the center of the boundary between Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, contains coal and heavy industries. Zaozhuang has experienced severe O3 pollution in recent years and it is crucial to identify the key drivers. This study aims to deeply excavate and analyze the formation mechanism of O3 in Zaozhuang based on hourly measured volatile organic compound (VOC) concentration data for the year 2023, combined with meteorological factors and other atmospheric pollutants, using a machine learning model in combination with the SHapley Additive Properties Interpretation method and Positive Matrix Factorization model. The results show the important contributions of meteorological factors to O3 production, especially solar radiation and temperature. Among atmospheric pollutants, VOCs are the main contributors, with significant effects from alkene and oxygenated VOCs, whereas propene and acetone have the most critical individual impacts on local O3 production. O3 peaked in June and August, with June seeing added contributions from temperature, and a higher chemical variable contribution than meteorological factors in August, led by NO2, OVOCs, and alkenes. The effects of the six emission sources on O3 formation in Zaozhuang showed that chemical emission sources (5.98 μg/m3), combustion sources (3.75 μg/m3), and solvent use sources (3.06 μg/m3) were the main drivers. The solvent source exhibited the most significant change on the O3 polluted day, with a relative increase of 115%. This relative increase was significantly higher than that of the other sources. During persistent pollution events with the highest levels of O3, the use of solvents made the greatest contribution to the emission sources, representing 23% of the total impact of the emission sources. Therefore, an integrated approach using machine learning, SHapley Additive Properties Interpretation, and Positive Matrix Factorization rapidly diagnoses the causes of O3 pollution at different timescales and provides a basis for targeted control measures."

 Understanding the impacts of land surface processes on summer extreme precipitation is crucial for accurate climate predictions. This study investigated these impacts across three subregions of eastern China (North China, Central China, and South China) using the regional Climate–Weather Research and Forecasting model with two land surface parameterization schemes: the Conjunctive Surface–Subsurface Process (CSSP) scheme and the NOAH Land Surface Model (NOAH). When compared with observational and reanalysis data, both schemes were found to successfully reproduce the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation, with the CSSP scheme showing distinct advantages in simulating evapotranspiration. The influence of land surface processes on summer extreme precipitation varies among the three subregions, largely depending on soil moisture conditions. In North China, a transitional zone between arid and humid regions, soil moisture primarily influences extreme precipitation, with biases arising from difference between the lifting condensation level and the planetary boundary layer height. In Central China, where soil moisture is moderate, soil moisture and net radiation jointly influence extreme precipitation, with biases linked to the planetary boundary layer height. In South China, where soil moisture is mostly saturated during summer, net radiation dominates the variability of land surface variables, with latent heat bias leading to extreme precipitation bias. Overall, soil moisture affects extreme precipitation by altering the energy and stability of the planetary boundary layer and the lifting condensation level. These findings could inform the assessment and future improvement of models, and support the monitoring and predicting of extreme precipitation events."
