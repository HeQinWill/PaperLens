10.5194/acp-25-8087-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注冬季风暴中冰相粒子的生长和衰减过程，特别是与降水带相关的微物理演变。它利用数值模拟和观测数据来研究冰晶在不同环境条件下的变化，以及这些变化如何影响雷达测量和降水累积。虽然论文提到了雷达反射率等遥感数据，但其重点在于冰相微物理过程，而非大气环境遥感技术的应用，例如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。,"['Ice crystal growth', 'Ice water content', 'Radar reflectivity', 'Doppler velocity', 'Sublimation', 'Winter storm microphysics']",Andrew DeLaFrance;Lynn A. McMurdie;Angela K. Rowe;Andrew J. Heymsfield,Ambient and intrinsic dependencies of evolving ice-phase particles within a decaying winter storm during IMPACTS,"Numerical modeling simulations are used to investigate ice crystal growth and decay processes within a banded region of enhanced precipitation rates during a prominent winter storm. We identify robust primary ice growth in the upper portion of the cloud but decay exceeding 70 % during fallout through a subsaturated layer. The ice fall characteristics and decay rate are sensitive to the ambient cloud properties, which has implications for radar-based measurements and precipitation accumulations. 
 Mesoscale bands develop within winter cyclones as concentrated regions of locally enhanced radar reflectivity, often corresponding to intensified precipitation rates lasting several hours. Surface precipitation characteristics are governed by the microphysical properties of the ice-phase particles aloft, yet their unique microphysical evolutionary pathways and ambient environmental dependencies in banded regions remain poorly understood, in part due to a paucity of observations within clouds. Addressing this need, the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms measured properties of winter cyclones from airborne in situ and remote sensing platforms. Observations collected within a banded region of a decaying-stage northeast United States cyclone revealed a microphysical pathway characterized by precipitation fallout from a weak generating cell layer through an ∼ 2 km deep subsaturated downdraft region. Sublimation was a dominant evolutionary process, resulting in a > 70 % reduction in the initial characteristic ice water content (IWC). This vertical evolution was reproduced by a one-dimensional (1D) particle-based model simulation constrained by observations, conveying accuracy in the process representation. Four sensitivity simulations assessed evolutionary dependencies based on observationally informed perturbations of the ambient relative humidity, RH, and vertical air motion, w. Perturbations of ∼ 2 % RH significantly varied the resultant characteristic IWC loss, by as much as 29 %, whereas comparable perturbations of w had negligible effects. Intrinsic particle evolution during sublimation  demonstrated a notable imprint on vertical profiles of radar reflectivity, but the Doppler velocity was more strongly governed by the ambient w profile. These findings contextualize radar-based discrimination of sublimation from other ice-phase processes, including riming and aggregation."

Y. Cheung;Peter A. Alpert,Copper accelerates photochemically induced radical chemistry of iron-containing secondary organic aerosol (SOA),"Aerosol particles composed of metal complexes generate radicals as a result of photochemical reactions. The reactive species generated are hazardous to human health. We report microscopy data with particles composed of an organic proxy exposed to UV light. We found that copper influenced the reoxidation and initial iron reduction via photolysis of the complex. New model results suggest that we need to account for decreased photochemical activity and use a copper-induced reoxidation reaction. 
 Photochemical aging in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles alters their chemical composition and affects their adverse health effects. However, there is limited mechanistic insight on the role of transition metals in photochemical SOA aging and the evolution of the oxidative potential through their effect on radical chemistry. Here, we investigated the influence of copper (Cu) on the photochemical aging of iron (Fe) containing SOA in single particles using scanning transmission X-ray microscope measurements and chemical box modeling. The SOA proxy included citric acid (CA), iron(III) citrate (FeIII(Cit)), and copper(II) citrate (CuII(HCit)), which were exposed to UV light (λ=365 nm) in a humidified environmental cell. We modeled known catalytic radical destruction mechanisms resulting from cross-redox reactions between copper and iron. Simulating anoxic FeIII(Cit)/CuII(HCit)/CA aging experiments showed a lower initial iron(III) reduction compared to FeIII(Cit)/CA particles, indicating a reduced iron(II) quantum yield than from the photolysis of the FeIII(Cit) alone. We hypothesize that this effect may be due to copper replacing an iron center in a polynuclear complex. At higher relative humidity up to 60 %, a lower iron(II) quantum yield could not account for our observations of iron reoxidation in the dark. Instead, reoxidation appears to be highly sensitive to a potential copper(II)-induced reoxidation reaction. We provide a comprehensive discussion and evaluation of the poorly understood role of copper in modifying redox and radical chemistry, which is relevant for reactions involving transition metals mixed with SOA in the atmosphere."

Measurements were conducted in wintertime in the Po Valley, Italy, using aerosol mass spectrometry. The fog was enriched in more hygroscopic inorganic compounds and ON, containing, e.g., imidazoles. The formation of imidazole by aerosol–fog interactions could be confirmed for the first time in atmospheric observations. Findings highlight the role of fog in nitrogen aerosol formation. 
 While aerosol–cloud interactions have been extensively investigated, large knowledge gaps still exist. Atmospheric organic nitrogen (ON) species and their formation in the aqueous phase are potentially important due to (1) their influence on aerosol optical and hygroscopic properties and (2) their adverse effects on human health. This study aimed to characterize the wintertime aerosol and fog chemical composition, with a focus on the formation of ON, at a rural site in the Italian Po Valley. Online chemical characterization of interstitial aerosol (nonactivated particles) and fog residuals (dried fog droplets) were performed in parallel. Fog residuals were sampled using a ground-based counterflow virtual impactor (GCVI) inlet and analyzed by a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS), while the interstitial aerosol was characterized by a high-resolution time-of-flight AMS (HR-ToF-AMS). Our results revealed an enhancement of nitrate (NO3-; 43.3 % vs. 34.6 %), ammonium (NH4+; 15.2 % vs. 11.7 %), and sulfate (SO42-; 10.5 % vs. 6.6 %) in the fog residuals compared to the ambient non-fog aerosol, while organic aerosol (OA; 27.6 % vs. 39.4 %) and refractory black carbon (rBC; 2.3 % vs. 6.3 %) were less abundant. An enrichment of ON was observed in the fog, mainly consisting of CxHyN1+ ions, partly originating from amines in the fog. CxHyN2+ ions, fragments linked to imidazoles, were overproportionally present in the fog, which was verified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance  (1H-NMR) spectroscopy, suggesting aqueous-phase formation. This study demonstrates that fogs and clouds are potentially important sinks for gaseous nitrogen species and media for the aqueous production of nitrogen-containing organic aerosol in the atmosphere."

Multiple models are applied to attribute to changes in anthropogenic emissions and climate. The results highlight that increases in anthropogenic emissions are the primary driver of ozone increases both in the free troposphere and at the surface. 
 We apply a statistical model, two machine learning models, and three chemical transport models to attribute the observed ozone increases over East and Southeast Asia (ESEA) to changes in anthropogenic emissions and climate. Despite variations in model capabilities and emission inventories, all chemical transport models agree that increases in anthropogenic emission are a primary driver of ozone increases in 1995–2019. The models attribute 53 %–59 % of the increase in tropospheric ozone burden over ESEA to changes in anthropogenic emissions, with emission within ESEA contributing by 66 %–77 %. South Asia has increasing contribution to ozone increases over ESEA. At the surface, the models attribute 69 %–75 % of the ozone increase in 1995–2019 to changes in anthropogenic emissions. Climate change also contributes substantially to the increase in summertime tropospheric (41 %–47 %) and surface ozone (25 %–31 %). We find that emission reductions in China since 2013 have led to contrasting responses in ozone levels in the troposphere (decrease) and at the surface (increase). From 2013 to 2019, the ensemble mean derived from multiple models estimate that 66 % and 56 % of the summertime surface ozone enhancement in the North China Plain and the Yangtze River Delta could be attributed to changes in anthropogenic emissions, respectively, with the remaining attributed to meteorological factors. In contrast, changes in anthropogenic emissions dominate summertime ozone increase in the Pearl River Delta and Sichuan Basin (91 %–95 %). Our study underscores the need for long-term observational data, improved emission inventories, and advanced modeling frameworks to better understand the mechanisms of ozone increases in ESEA."

The formation of carbonyl compounds in solid and liquid fuel is governed by combustion temperature and emission standards, respectively. Fuel type determines the chemical composition. Biomass burning and farm machinery are key drivers of atmospheric oxidation capacity. This study provides actionable solutions to safeguard public health. 
 Fuel combustion is an important primary source of carbonyl compounds (CCs), yet the emission factors and influencing factors of CCs in different sources remain unclear. The emission characteristics, influencing factors, and ozone formation potentials of CCs from four combustion sources, including biomass burning (BB), residential coal combustion, on-road sources, and agricultural machinery, were investigated by field measurements. Results indicate that the emission factors of CCs from four combustion sources exhibit significant differences. Specifically, the emission factors of CCs from BB (1968.2 ± 661.2 mg kg−1) are significantly higher than those from other sources, being an order of magnitude greater than those from the on-road sources (117.8 ± 78.3–576.3 ± 47.4 mg kg−1). Fuel type is a key factor affecting the CC components. BB primarily emits formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, whereas residential coal combustion exhibits a higher proportion of aromatic aldehydes and acetone. The addition of ethanol in on-road sources and biodiesel in agricultural machinery effectively promotes the formation of acetaldehyde and unsaturated aldehydes, respectively. The formation of CCs in solid and liquid fuel sources is more sensitive to combustion temperature and emission standard, respectively. Higher combustion temperatures and stricter emission standards can reduce CC emissions by 94.6 % in solid fuels and by 61.3 % in liquid fuels, respectively. High temperatures promote the cyclization of small molecules, supplying ample precursors for the formation of acetone and aromatic aldehydes. More attention should be paid to the ozone formation potentials of CCs from BB and agricultural machinery to alleviate the oxidizing capacity of regional atmospheres."

Anomalous strong TP thermal forcing induces anticyclonic anomalies in the upper troposphere over the TP, which strengthens and attenuates the northern and southern branches of the westerly jet, intensifying (weakening) the westerly trough for more (fewer) tropopause folds of ozone STT over the East Asian region. 
 Stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) is an essential natural source of tropospheric ozone. Focusing on the STT variations in late spring and early summer with frequent ozone STT over the Asian region, this study investigated the Tibetan Plateau (TP) thermal effect on the interannual STT variations with the meteorological data over 1980–2014. The distinct structures of interannual STT anomalies with the key areas of TP thermal forcing are identified through the 35-year climatological statistics. Positive anomalies of thermal forcing over the central and eastern TP exert opposing impacts on the increasing and decreasing ozone STT, respectively, along the northern and southern branches of the westerly jet around the TP. Such stronger TP thermal forcing induces anticyclonic anomalies in the upper troposphere over the TP and the surroundings, which strengthens and attenuates the northern and southern branches of the westerly jet, intensifying and weakening the westerly trough for more (fewer) tropopause folds of ozone STT over the East Asian region. Furthermore, the positive anomalies of thermal forcing over the western TP are related to the western enhancing and eastern declining STT over the Asian region. This study reveals the distinct structures of interannual variations in ozone STT induced by the TP thermal forcing, providing a new perspective for the TP effect on the atmospheric environment."

Determining which flight formed each contrail is a critical step to decreasing this impact. We introduce a dataset of synthetic contrail observations with known flight attributions that can be used to develop and assess geostationary-satellite-based contrail-to-flight attribution systems. We additionally introduce a new attribution algorithm and show that it outperforms previous methods. 
 Condensation trail (contrail) cirrus clouds cause a substantial fraction of aviation's climate impact. One proposed method for the mitigation of this impact involves modifying flight paths to avoid particular regions of the atmosphere that are conducive to the formation of persistent contrails, which can transform into contrail cirrus. Determining the success of such avoidance maneuvers can be achieved by ascertaining which flight formed each nearby contrail observed in satellite imagery. The same process can be used to assess the skill of contrail forecast models. The problem of contrail-to-flight attribution is complicated by several factors, such as the time required for a contrail to become visible in satellite imagery, high air traffic densities, and errors in wind data. Recent work has introduced automated algorithms for solving the attribution problem, but it lacks an evaluation against ground-truth data. In this work, we present a method for producing synthetic contrail detections with predetermined contrail-to-flight attributions that can be used to evaluate – or “benchmark” –  and improve such attribution algorithms. The resulting performance metrics can be employed to understand the implications of using these observational data in downstream tasks, such as forecast model evaluation and the analysis of contrail avoidance trials, although the metrics do not directly quantify real-world performance. We also introduce a novel, highly scalable contrail-to-flight attribution algorithm that leverages the characteristic compounding of error induced by simulating contrail advection using numerical weather models. The benchmark shows an improvement of approximately 25 % in precision versus previous contrail-to-flight attribution algorithms, without compromising recall."

We demonstrated that PBLHT-BE-ML greatly improved the comparisons against sounding-derived PBLHT. 
 Remote sensing measurements have been widely used to estimate the planetary boundary layer height (PBLHT). Each remote sensing approach offers unique strengths and faces different limitations. In this study, we use machine learning (ML) methods to produce a best-estimate PBLHT (PBLHT-BE-ML) by integrating four PBLHT estimates derived from remote sensing measurements at the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) observatory. Three ML models – random forest (RF) classifier, RF regressor, and light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM) – were trained on a dataset from 2017 to 2023 that included radiosonde, various remote sensing PBLHT estimates, and atmospheric meteorological conditions. Evaluations indicated that PBLHT-BE-ML from all three models improved alignment with the PBLHT derived from radiosonde data (PBLHT-SONDE), with LightGBM demonstrating the highest accuracy under both stable and unstable boundary layer conditions. Feature analysis revealed that the most influential input features at the SGP site were the PBLHT estimates derived from (a) potential temperature profiles retrieved using Raman lidar (RL) and atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer (AERI) measurements (PBLHT-THERMO), (b) vertical velocity variance profiles from Doppler lidar (PBLHT-DL), and (c) aerosol backscatter profiles from micropulse lidar (PBLHT-MPL). The trained models were then used to predict PBLHT-BE-ML at a temporal resolution of 10 min, effectively capturing the diurnal evolution of PBLHT and its significant seasonal variations, with the largest diurnal variation observed over summer at the SGP site. We applied these trained models to data from the ARM Eastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) field campaign (EPC), where the PBLHT-BE-ML, particularly with the LightGBM model, demonstrated improved accuracy against PBLHT-SONDE. Analyses of model performance at both the SGP and EPC sites suggest that expanding the training dataset to include various surface types, such as ocean and ice-covered areas, could further enhance ML model performance for PBLHT estimation across varied geographic regions."

This paper reports the results of a major effort that has been undertaken to re-evaluate Marsili's observations, converting historical measurements into modern units – water weight to water density – with bathymetric profiles mapping the locations where these measurements were made and sea level variations alongside consideration of the associated error. 
 The work Histoire physique de la mer, authored by Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (or Marsigli) and published in 1725, is one of the earliest texts detailing observations of the physical, biological, and bathymetric characteristics of the sea, mainly concentrating on the Gulf of Lion in southern France's Mediterranean area. Nonetheless, understanding Marsili's findings is difficult due to the application of non-standard measurement units and the imprecision of georeferencing data. The MACMAP project (A Multidisciplinary Analysis of Climate Change Indicators in the Mediterranean and Polar Regions), which is funded by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, has involved a thorough recalibration of Marsili's observations. This project focused on transforming water weight measurements obtained from different locations in the Gulf of Lion from June 1806 to January 1807 into water density values.

 Limitations of current process-based soil erosion models, valuable tools for predicting and managing soil erosion, lie particularly with today’s data availability, parameter uncertainty, and the integration of changing environmental conditions.

This technique permits comprehensive observation of soil surface elevation changes during precipitation events, encompassing data acquisition at diverse scales, from plot to slope to micro-catchment. The study presents a worldwide unique dataset that integrates high-resolution time-lapse photogrammetry, field measurements, and UAV (uncrewed aerial vehicle) photogrammetric data, collected over nearly four years. This dataset is intended to enhance the understanding of soil erosion processes and serve as a valuable resource for model evaluation and calibration.

However, this process can be inhibited in the presence of aromatic substrates. Conventional advanced oxidation protocols involve the mineralization of aromatics, but the widespread adoption of such protocols is limited by high energy and chemical requirements. In this study, we present a novel electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) protocol to transform bioinhibiting aromatics into bioavailable aliphatic products, thereby promoting biologically driven denitrification. A highly active carbon-supported ruthenium electrode was designed to convert various unsaturated, aromatic, and halogenated aromatic pollutants into aliphatic products, achieving conversion efficiencies of 66.0%–100%. After 5 day incubation, the saturated products enhanced the denitrification rate by up to 614.0%. The relative abundance of denitrifiers in the sequencing batch reactor landfill sludge increased, confirming that the aliphatic products from ECH treatment could enhance bioavailability. This work demonstrates the integration of electrochemical and biological catalysis, valorizing pollutants into biologically useful products that can improve denitrification, especially in existing high-organic-load wastewater treatment networks."

The metabolic processes and transformation products (TPs) of BPs in vivo play a crucial role in determining their toxicological effects, with the gut microbiota serving as a key factor. However, studies on transformation of BPs by GM are scarce. In this study, we investigated the transformation of 21 BPs by six human gut bacterial strains in vitro. Among these, bisphenol A-glycerol methacrylate (Bis-GMA) was significantly transformed by different bacteria, and eight species-specific TPs were identified, including acetylated, ester-hydrolyzed, and palmitoylated products. In vivo studies further confirmed that Bis-GMA was converted into bisphenol A bis (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether (Bis-HPPP), the same product identified in vitro. Bis-HPPP exhibited a lower cytotoxicity than Bis-GMA in cytotoxicity assays. Furthermore, compared to Bis-HPPP, Bis-GMA induced more severe damage to human intestinal organoid function, including effects on apoptosis, cell proliferation, and the expression of key biomarkers. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the species-specific transformation of environmental contaminants by a human GM, highlighting the important role of microbial transformation in modulating toxicity of environmental pollutants."

In shale oil reservoirs, however, there is no aquifer below the oil leg, and it is unclear if biodegradation can take place. Here, we investigated the microbial community in crude oil from a shale oil reservoir in China. We found small water droplets trapped in the shale oil (approximately 2 × 105 droplets/mL oil) originating from ancient groundwater. These droplets contained over 100-fold greater cell density than the production water from shale reservoirs and a high cell viability comparable to those measured in groundwater. Most intact cells were mainly distributed at the oil–water interface of the water droplets, whereas dead cells were located in the water phase. Based on the determined cell density, we conservatively extrapolate the global microbial population in water droplets in oil to be 10–8 to 10–6 of the total microbial biomass in the subsurface. Our study revealed a community of chemoheterotrophs in the water droplets that are most likely feeding on dissolved hydrocarbons and extracellular substances derived from biomass and detritus. The results indicate that small water droplets in shale oil reservoirs harbor a complex and active microbial community, contributing to biodegradation."

While recent advances in reductive approaches using hydrated electrons (eaq–) have shown promise for C–F bond activation, most require high photosensitizer loadings, suffer from poor electron utilization, and lack compatibility with diverse PFAS structures. Here, we report a micellar photocatalytic system using the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) under UV irradiation to enhance eaq– utilization for PFAS degradation. A diverse range of legacy and emerging PFAS compounds containing sulfonate (–SO3–), carboxylate (–CO2–), hydrocarbon (–C2H2–), and ether (–O–) moieties, were completely degraded with fewer than four C–F bonds remaining in transformation products. Characterization revealed strong interactions between CTAB and PFAS, which spontaneously formed positively charged cationic–anionic micelles even at low concentrations. These micelles act as nanoreactors, trapping eaq– from the bulk phase, suppressing geminate recombination, and facilitating direct electron transfer to PFAS molecules. A comprehensive degradation pathway was identified, involving micellization, electron trapping, PFAS activation, and downstream radical-mediated reactions that lead to further destruction. The UV/CTAB system demonstrated sustained performance across multiple treatment cycles and exhibited resilience to oxygen and common aqueous cocontaminants. These findings reveal that efficient utilization of eaq–, rather than their abundance, governs C–F bond activation and PFAS degradation. This approach enables integrated PFAS separation and mineralization while establishing a framework for designing scalable, photosensitizer-free redox systems."

Comprehensive identification of these TPs is imperative for environmental risk assessment and optimization of oxidation methodologies. Traditional experimental approaches for TP elucidation are often hindered by substantial financial and technical constraints, limiting their applicability in high-throughput scenarios. Here, we introduce TP-Transformer, an advanced deep learning framework designed to predict both the structures of TPs and their corresponding formation pathways. Trained on Chem_Oxi_2K, a meticulously curated data set comprising 2780 pollutant degradation reactions, TP-Transformer achieved a notable accuracy of 86.28% in TP prediction. The model adeptly reconstructs complete degradation pathways, addressing the intricate challenge of pathway elucidation. Attention analyses indicate that the TP-Transformer discerns reactive moieties within substrates and correlates them with specific reaction conditions, emulating expert-level chemical reasoning. Experimental validations corroborate the model’s robustness, with accurate TP predictions ranging from 80.20 to 92.86% for five pollutants absent from the training data set.

This study aims to explore how MPs change the feeding of planktivorous silver carp. After exposure to MPs, the utilization efficiency of zooplankton by carp increased from 28.45% to 38.63–40.20%, while that of phytoplankton decreased from 50.64% to 40.47–43.32%. MPs did not cause changes in the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities that carp consumed but altered its gut microbiota, leading to increased abundance of genes encoding proteases but decreased carbohydrase genes. Gut metabolomics further showed corresponding metabolic changes especially with increased levels of l-tyrosine, citrulline, succinic acid, and propionic acid, which are significantly correlated with the isotopic signatures of carp utilizing zooplankton. Germ-free zebrafish transplanted with feces of MPs-exposed carp showed metabolic changes like those of carp, verifying that the gut microbiota mediated the effects induced by MPs, while silver carp transplanted with feces of MPs-exposed carp exhibited increased protease activity and enhanced zooplankton utilization efficiency, confirming that MPs could alter its food utilization via gut microbiota. Our findings fill a knowledge gap regarding the ecological risk of MPs to the feeding of planktivorous fish, with potential cascading effects on aquatic ecosystems."

However, their reliance on expensive membranes increases operational costs and introduces membrane-related challenges. To address this, our laboratory has developed a preparative vertical free-flow electrophoresis (PVFE) technique using cost-effective quartz sands instead of expensive membranes. This innovative technique has effectively produced acids and bases from industrial high-salt wastewater. However, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and mass transfer is essential to enhancing the design and performance of the developed PVFE. Herein, the effects of voltage, flow rate, and feed concentration on ion migration in PVFE were systematically examined, providing detailed insights into its driving mechanisms. Results revealed that quartz sand packing effectively suppresses ion diffusion while ensuring a proper ion orientation during electromigration and convection. Additionally, both simulation and empirical models validate the mass-transfer mechanisms and quantify the effect of key operational parameters on the ion transfer capacity. Economic analysis further highlights that PVFE operates within the limiting current, achieving ∼100% current efficiency at low operating costs (5.94 yuan/kg for base and 6.87 yuan/kg for acid).

We conducted a systematic literature review on microorganism removal by physical treatment processes used in drinking water treatment systems with the aim of providing current summary data to update the World Health Organization’s Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (GDWQ) and to reflect on the data available for comparison of treatment technologies. We reviewed peer-reviewed articles reporting original data that were published between 1997 and March 2022 on the following physical treatment technologies: roughing filters, storage reservoirs, bank filtration, conventional and high-rate clarification, dissolved air flotation, lime softening, granular media filtration, slow sand filtration, precoat filtration, membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, ceramic membrane filtration, and soil aquifer treatment. The literature search was conducted in several databases including Web of Science and PubMed. Data from 165 articles were included in the analysis and used to calculate Log Reduction Values (LRVs) for each technology by microbial contaminant type (bacteria, virus, or protozoa). The quantity and quality of data ranged widely for each technology. We found granular media, membranes (microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO)), and precoat filtration to remove the most protozoa with average LRVs of 3.0 (95% CI 2.8–3.3), 5.7 (95% CI 5.4–6.0), and 4.4 (95% CI 4.1–4.7), respectively. Bacteria was removed most effectively by membrane filtration (MF, UF, RO) with average LRVs of 4.5 (95% CI 3.9–5.1) and moderately by dissolved air flotation, lime softening, and soil aquifer treatment with average LRVs of 2.7, 2.6, and 2.4 respectively. Viruses were removed most effectively by reverse osmosis membrane filtration with an average LRV of 4.9 (95% CI 4.0–5.7). This data provides valuable information on pathogen reduction and areas of needed research. The variation in results underscores the importance of further consideration when selecting technologies to use and the need for standardized reporting in both lab and field studies. It is important to consider variables in water quality and technology operation that may impact treatment effectiveness when selecting treatment options for use.

This study presents compelling evidence of strong convergence of MP at a small-scale surface front near the Eastern Johor Strait (EJS), a typical urbanized coast in Southeast Asia, revealing an estuary tidal intrusion front as a recurrent hotspot that concentrates MP at levels comparable to known estuarine frontal systems. Significantly elevated levels of floating microplastics (150.5 ± 19.8 MP pieces/L) were detected at the surface front compared to other surface water samples along the coast (p < 0.001; 9.2 ± 4.8 MP pieces/L). Hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate that the dynamic interplay between freshwater and seawater are the key mechanisms governing this process. The resulting convergence zones effectively trap buoyant plastics, forming quasi-persistent accumulation zones. Specifically, during ebb tide, parallel outflows from the Johor River and inner EJS amplify frontal convergence, actively trapping floating plastics at the salinity boundary. These findings highlight estuarine surface fronts as influential and previously underquantified systemic pathways influencing MP circulation and retention at marginal seas. Recognizing these traceable accumulation hotspots at ocean boundaries is an urgent priority, offering opportunities for targeted mitigation, particularly in high-leakage regions."

Also, there are methodological challenges in confirming the actual occurrence and visualizing the original morphology of MPs in the retrieved sperm samples. Here, we identified sub-10-μm polystyrene (PS) MPs with protein coronas in mechanically retrieved sperm specimens on PS plastic Petri dishes through optical photothermal infrared imaging. The particles were mainly generated by the tools that induced local polymer cutting deformation on the dishes, and a few originated from resin particles remaining on the dishes during manufacture.

The transmission variations across language-usage regions were observed during COVID-19, however the potential differences from languages on aerosol transmission are poorly understood. Here, fifty-one multilingual volunteers were recruited to speak same-semantic dialogues in three languages selected from eight different languages studied to investigate the emission characteristics of exhaled aerosol across languages. The findings revealed that the size of exhaled aerosol particles generated by speaking was predominantly concentrated below 1 μm. The emission loads of exhaled aerosols during speaking and the associated potential risk of aerosol transmission across languages showed notable discrepancies. Additionally, the individual physiological factors such as age, gender and body mass index (BMI) also jointly influenced the exhaled aerosols during speaking. The machine learning model of random forest regression further revealed that language differences had a considerably greater impact on size-resolved exhaled aerosol emission concentrations than gender, but not than BMI. Thus, different language usages can influence the emission concentrations of exhaled aerosol during speaking, thereby impacting the potential for aerosol transmission across languages. This linguistic-induced diversity of transmission potentials could have played a non-negligible role in the disparate global dissemination patterns observed in aerosol-transmitted pandemics including COVID-19."

However, due to methodological limitations, the underlying mechanisms of VOC-induced aortic fibrosis remains unclear. To address this gap, we established a real-world indoor renovation VOC inhalation mouse model and used an innovative ex vivo biosensor assay with endothelial cells to respond to serum derived from VOC exposed mice, exploring the adverse health outcomes of total VOCs on the aorta and its potential mechanisms. The ex vivo biosensor assay confirmed that VOCs triggered phenotypic transformation of aortic smooth muscle cells via epigenetic changes in aortic endothelial cells. Mechanistically, VOCs elevated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation by upregulating DNMT1, leading to mtDNA leakage and subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING inflammatory pathway. By integrating real-world indoor VOC exposure with mechanistic cellular analysis, this ex vivo biosensor assay offers a physiologically relevant model to elucidate the systemic vascular toxicity of complex environmental mixtures. Overall, this study revealed the molecular mechanism of indoor VOC-induced aortic fibrosis based on increased mtDNA methylation in aortic endothelial cells, which mediated the phenotypic transformation of aortic smooth muscle cells. mtDNA methylation may serve as a potential target for preventing aortic fibrosis or alleviating symptoms in affected patients.

This study aims to examine the association between energy burden and CKD prevalence across 500 U.S. cities by using nationally representative data sets. Utilizing propensity score matching and a random intercept analysis, we found that census tracts with high energy burden were significantly associated with a 0.195 higher chronic kidney prevalence [95% CI: 0.144–0.246] compared to those with low energy burden, after adjusting key observed characteristics such as living, housing, and sociodemographic conditions of census tracts. Other risk factors contributing to increased CKD prevalence included older building age, higher percentages of nonwhite populations and older adults, lower educational levels, and lower average household incomes. The findings highlight that energy burden is not merely a financial problem but rather a social determinant of CKD health and a significant risk factor for increased CKD prevalence in U.S. urban areas.

Preliminary studies have explored mechanisms of ITO NP-induced pulmonary toxicity, but a gap remains in effective methods for risk assessments. To address this issue, we integrated data from population disease databases with traditional toxicology and RNA sequencing to conduct mechanistic studies and establish an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) for ITO NP-induced lung injury. Our findings demonstrate that exposure to ITO NPs induces early pulmonary fibrosis, characterized by a persistent inflammatory response in mice. Mechanistic analysis reveals that lung injury is driven by the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway mediated by IL-17A in macrophages. In the AOP framework for ITO-induced pulmonary fibrosis, IL-17A serves as a molecular initiating event, initiating the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in macrophages. This activation results in the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and fibrogenic factors (TGF-β1), ultimately triggering a cellular-level inflammatory response. The sustained inflammation further promotes microvascular leakage, which is a key contributor to the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations of supportive inconsistent evidence for MIE and KEs show that the confidence of this AOP is moderate."

Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to phthalate esters (PAEs) could play a role in this trend. However, the relationship between PAE exposure and pubertal development in Chinese girls remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to address this issue by investigating the link between levels of urinary phthalate ester metabolites (mPAEs) and the risk of early puberty among 546 Chinese girls (6–8 years old) over a two-year monitoring program. Poisson regression, restricted cubic spline models, weighted quantile sum regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression were used to assess both individual and combined effects of PAEs on pubertal development. Significant links were found between urinary concentrations of monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobutyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, the total of low molecular weight mPAEs, the total of nine commonly detected mPAEs, and the total of all mPAEs with the risk of early breast development (all P-trend < 0.05). Furthermore, levels of MnBP, MiBP, low molecular weight mPAEs, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate were positively associated with early menarche. Mixture effect analysis revealed incidence rate ratios of 1.64 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10–2.45) for early breast development and 2.33 (95% CI: 1.22–4.45) for early menarche.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain a mystery. Here, maternal mice were exposed to As via drinking water. Subsequently, the hippocampi of their offspring were collected at different developmental stages to explore the dynamic changes during hippocampal maturation and the effects of As. Time-series RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant temporal correlation between As neurodevelopmental toxicity and the mRNA expression profile of the hippocampal region during critical postnatal developmental windows. Further, downregulation of genes associated with neurogenesis and telomere maintenance was observed. Notably, dynamic changes in hippocampal telomeres were observed in response to As exposure, with critically shortened telomeres inhibiting neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation, impairing neuroblast maturation, and reducing the number and size of neurospheres. Additionally, the populations of BrdU+ and MAP2+ cells were decreased while GFAP+ cells were increased, indicating a decline in NSCs stemness.

Despite growing concerns, the pathways through which ARGs migrate from environmental reservoirs to animal microbiomes are poorly understood. In this study, we raised mice from birth in pig manure-fertilized red (Ultisols) and black (Mollisols) soils or unfertilized controls, sampling their gut microbiomes at 8 weeks, to show that early life exposure to manure-fertilized soil profoundly shapes the gut antibiotic resistome in mice. Application of organic manure significantly enriched tetracycline-resistant ARGs in both red and black soils. Mice living in these environments harbored markedly higher abundances of ARGs, particularly the tet(Q) gene, compared to those in nonfertilized environments. Notably, Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae were identified as key hosts of tet(Q), with evidence suggesting a horizontal gene transfer between these families.

While this focus has heightened public awareness and influenced the regulation of plastics, isolating nanoplastics toxicity risks inefficiently allocating research resources and hindering sustainable management strategies. Here, using data mining and machine learning, we show that research on nanoplastics toxicity closely mirrors that of engineered nanoparticles, a well-established domain of nanotoxicology. Examining 154,745 research articles on nanoparticle and nanoplastics toxicology, we find that both particle types share similar physicochemical properties, biological uptake mechanisms, toxicity profiles, and structure–toxicity relationships. Although nanoplastics pollution is more pervasive in scale and morphological diversity, its toxicological attributes align with those documented for other nanoscale materials. We challenge the notion that nanoplastics pose a distinct, separate risk, proposing instead that integrating nanoplastics toxicity into the broader field of nanotoxicology can streamline research, prevent duplication of effort, and more efficiently guide policies, resource use, and remediation strategies toward globally sustainable outcomes."

The present study explored wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a campus setting in Pune, Maharashtra, India, offering insights into variant-specific trends and their correlation with clinical cases over a 2.5 year period from November 2021 to April 2024. We collected 242 wastewater samples from the campus sewershed and processed them to extract RNA and perform RT-qPCR and sequencing, followed by lineage assignment using the LCS tool. Early signals of different SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as BA.2.X, JN.1.X, and KP.2.X, were detected in wastewater prior to its first clinical report in Maharashtra, India. Wastewater viral load strongly correlated with clinical cases during the Omicron phase (ρ = 0.73–0.81) compared to the post-Omicron phase (ρ = −0.06 to 0.31). This study also highlights that alerts and warnings issued on the basis of wastewater viral hikes have proven instrumental in preventing outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 variants on campus. However, downgrading COVID-19 from pandemic status by the WHO resulted in a subsequent decrease in public vigilance, changing the viral dynamic in the last phase of the study.

While inhalation and ingestion are well-studied exposure pathways, dermal exposure remains underexplored. In recent years, the growing popularity of gaming─driven by extended home stays during the COVID-19 pandemic and the inclusion of e-sports in international competitions─has led to prolonged contact with gaming devices, particularly among young people and professional gamers. This study investigates dermal exposure to triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) from 37 home-use video game controllers. TPhP was detected in 5 first-party and 22 third-party controllers, with concentrations reaching up to 530 μg g–1. Using artificial skin (EPISKIN), we measured a TPhP skin permeation rate of 0.42 ng cm–2 h–1.

Based on satellite observations and climate model simulations, we find that these events contribute to ∼67% of Antarctic stratospheric aerosol burden averaged over the last two decades. Our modeled analysis of hypothetical eruptions reveals distinct transport pathways controlled by injection location, season, and polar vortex conditions. For tropical injections, Antarctic stratospheric aerosol loading exhibits strong dependence on interannual polar vortex strength, with enhanced poleward transport during weak vortex years and significant transport barriers during strong vortex periods. Unlike tropical eruptions, mid‐latitude eruptions exhibit season‐dependent characteristics: austral summer injections cause high Antarctic aerosol loadings in the first October following injections, whereas winter injections lead to elevated second‐year October aerosol burdens. These findings on how polar vortex modulates aerosol transport provide important insights for minimizing Antarctic ozone depletion risks in potential stratospheric aerosol injection strategies."

Quartz‐filled shear and extension veins are clustered in tens to hundreds of meters thick subduction shear zones exhumed from deep tremor source regions and record repeated brittle low‐angle thrust shear and tensile failure at near‐lithostatic fluid pressures. Seismic wave radiation from clustered quartz veins was modeled using a probabilistic cell automaton model. The results show that successive ruptures of clustered veins are capable of radiating seismic waves with consistent sizes of the seismologically observed tremor and very low‐frequency earthquake (VLFE) and that shear veins should be dominant over extension veins to explain the low‐angle thrust focal mechanisms of VLFE. We propose that tremor signals are primarily attributable to successive shear slip along shear veins in a finite‐thickness shear zone."

This method approximately supplements the diffusion term existing in the ensemble mean forecast, which is missed in the DNWP initialized from ensemble mean analysis. The diffusion filters noise from initial uncertainty. Experiments show higher skill in the new 4DEnVar‐initialized DNWP than in those initialized from 4DEnVar ensemble mean analysis using purely ensemble covariances and 4DVar analysis with a purely climatological covariance.

 Transcription factors such as Tbx5, Gata4, Mef2c and Pitx2 are required during cardiac development, and in adult cardiac homeostasis. We demonstrate that the gene dosage and modulation of these factors are mediated in vivo by the miR-200 family. Inhibition of a single miR-200 family member within the cluster results in defects of the left ventricle and cardiomyocyte maturation during development. Inhibition of the entire miR-200 family results in a ventricular septal defect and embryonic lethality by embryonic day (E)16.5.

 The ssrA-sspB dimerization system, derived from the bacterial degradation machinery, comprises a 7-residue ssrA peptide and its binding partner sspB. The compact size of ssrA makes it ideal for insertion into proteins of interest to manipulate host protein function by engineered light-responsive sspB. In contrast to the LOV2 caging strategy employed to develop optical dimerizers, we present herein two distinct photo-inducible binary interaction tools (PhoBITs) systems: PhoBIT1, a light-OFF switch generated by integrating LOV2 into sspB, and PhoBIT2, a light-ON switch building upon an evolved ssrA/CRY2-sspB pair with minimal basal interaction. These tools enable mechanistic dissection and optogenetic modulation of GPCRs, ion channels, necroptosis, and innate immune signaling. When incorporated into a monobody, PhoBIT2 allows photo-switchable inhibition of an oncogenic fusion protein to curtail leukemogenesis in vivo. Collectively, through targeted ssrA insertions, PhoBITs offer versatile control over diverse protein functions, thereby expanding possibilities for optogenetic engineering and potential therapeutic applications.

Here, the authors show that targeting CD142+ synovial fibroblasts might prevent knee joint destruction and reduce need for knee replacement in pre-clinical models. 
 Previous evidence suggest bone and cartilage damage is the main pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis joint destruction. However, the role of meniscus usually has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we identify CD142+ synovial fibroblasts as a subset located at sublining layer in normal and osteoarthritis synovium, which is increased and distributed at lining layer in rheumatoid arthritis synovium. Injection of CD142+ fibroblasts into DBA/1 male mice’s knee destructs meniscus but has slight effect on cartilage. ABCC4 is highly expressed in CD142+ fibroblasts, whose blockage by MK571 attenuates CD142+ fibroblasts-induced meniscus destruction through cAMP/PKA signaling. Long-term follow-up of rheumatoid arthritis cohort indicates that enriched CD142+ fibroblasts at lining layer are a risk factor for severe knee joint destruction and eventually undergo total knee arthroplasty. Our results demonstrate CD142+ fibroblasts as an indicator to assess prognosis and a therapeutic target to inhibit meniscal destruction, thereby alleviating rheumatoid arthritis knee joint damage.

 Electrooxidation of pollutants at potentials near or below the thermodynamic hydrogen evolution potential offers transformative opportunities for energy-efficient pollutant valorization and diverse energy devices. However, existing catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to the inevitable overoxidation. Herein, we present an amorphous phosphorus-doped CoFe₂O₄ catalyst that achieves industrial-level current densities (1 A cm⁻²) at ultralow potentials (0.06, 0.65, and −0.17 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) for hydrazine, sulfion, and borohydride electrooxidation, respectively, along with 400-hour stability at 300 mA cm⁻² in a hydrazine-assisted electrolyzer. Mechanistic studies reveal electron transfer from Co-P ligands to Co-O ligands, which enhances the involvement of Co-O ligands in low-potential electrooxidation while protecting Co-P ligands from overoxidation. Furthermore, more positive charges on Co centers lower the activation barrier for such pollutant electrooxidation. This work opens a paradigm for designing robust electrocatalysts by decoupling catalytic activity from oxidative deactivation.

 Visual scene analysis in the brain involves diverse grouping and segmentation processes mediated by intra- and inter-areal interactions, but the role of feedback from higher to lower visual cortices has remained largely speculative, relying mostly on indirect evidence. In this study with behaving monkeys, we investigated the causal impact of V4-to-V1 feedback on different figure-ground perceptual tasks employing distinct contextual cues. We compared neuronal responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) and the behavioral performance before and after silencing a higher-order visual area (V4). Our results reveal that V4-to-V1 feedback comprises dissociable facilitatory and inhibitory components that differ in their spatial distribution, onset time, modulatory polarity, and magnitude. This feedback is essential for, and consistent across, distinct grouping and segmentation processes, operating independently of V1 neurons’ selectivity for local features and primarily modifying the late phases of neuronal responses. These findings highlight fundamental differences between the mechanisms underlying global, feature-independent figure-ground organization and local, feature-dependent contextual analysis. Moreover, while the feedback modifies correlated variability in neural responses, this effect does not alter the neural population code. Our study underscores the central and unified role of corticocortical feedback in integrating and interpreting visual scenes, with implications for circuit-level mechanisms.

 While ionic liquids (ILs) have diverse applications, their potential in biomedical applications remains largely untapped due to gaps in systematic understanding of the spectrum of IL biosafety (biocompatibility/toxicity). Here, we establish an IL library and identify an in vitro reduction in biocompatibility (increased toxicity) with increased ILs’ cationic alkyl chain length. Particularly, we present compelling evidence for IL nanoaggregates in aqueous environment, thereby elucidating the mechanisms involved in cell interactions. ILs with short cationic alkyl chains (scILs) are restricted in intracellular vesicles, whereas ILs with long cationic alkyl chains (lcILs) accumulate to the mitochondria for inducing mitophagy and apoptosis. The occurrence of dysfunctional behaviour in lcILs is also observed in vivo, with a positive correlation between the lcIL signal in tissues and mitophagy/apoptotic levels. Irrespective of the administration routes (oral/intramuscular/intravenous), scILs exhibit ~30–80 times greater tolerance than lcILs. The feasibility of scIL nanoaggregates as carriers for insoluble drugs is thus validated, and an enhanced bioavailability over the commercial tablet is acquired. The findings obtained by integrating computational analysis with diverse cell/animal evaluations (from multiple cell lines, cell spheroids, patient-derived organoids to male murine and canine models) offer unique insights into the behaviour, mechanisms, and biomedical application scenarios of IL nanoaggregates.

Here, the authors construct 4f-orbital-modified RuO2 catalysts with tunable Ru–O polarity that enhance catalytic activity and durability. 
 The development of non-iridium-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is crucial for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), but hydrogen production remains a great challenge because of sluggish OER kinetics and severe catalyst dissolution. Here, we present a 4f-induced covalent polarity modulation strategy for the construction of 4f-orbital-modified RuO2 (4f-RuO2) nanocatalysts with tunable Ru–O polarity. We find that the OER activity of 4f-RuO2 shows a volcano shape as a function of the polarity of Ru–O bond. Consequently, the best 4f-Nd-RuO2 catalyst possesses an ultra-low overpotential of 214 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and robust electrochemical stability in 0.1 M HClO4. Theoretical calculations coupled with in situ synchrotron infrared and X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses reveal that the modulation of Ru–O polarity in RuO2 by the valence f−p−d gradient orbital coupling can modify the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates and suppress the participation of lattice oxygen to avoid over-oxidation of Ru, which can thus serve as an effective descriptor for fine tuning the activity and durability of acidic OER nanocatalysts.

 Perception of external temperature is essential for maintaining homeostasis and avoiding thermal injury. Although molecular thermosensors such as transient receptor potential melastatin type 8 (TRPM8) have been identified, the neural circuits responsible for transmitting cool signals remain unclear. Here we show that a spinal circuit in mice conveys cool signals from the skin to the brain. Excitatory interneurons in the spinal dorsal horn expressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (Trhr+) act as a central hub for cool sensation. These Trhr+ neurons receive monosynaptic input from TRPM8+ sensory afferents and are selectively activated by innocuous cool stimuli. Ablating Trhr+ interneurons abolishes behavioral responses to cool, but not to warm or cold stimuli. We also identify a population of calcitonin receptor-like receptor-positive (Calcrl+) spinal projection neurons that receive convergent input from both TRPM8+ afferents and Trhr+ interneurons, and transmit cool-specific signals to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN). Our findings define a feedforward amplification circuit for cool sensation and reveal a modality-specific spinal pathway for thermal processing.

 Solid waste in landfills continuously emits methane, which has become the third-largest anthropogenic source of methane emissions globally. The methane emissions from landfills exhibit substantial variability due to factors such as waste management practices and climatic conditions. Here we assessed methane emissions from 102 high-emitting landfills worldwide under different management strategies and climate conditions using 5 years of satellite observations. We find that, for these sites, total methane emissions from open dumps are underestimated by a factor of 5.3 ± 0.3 in the EDGAR v8.0 inventory. Transforming open dumpsites worldwide into sanitary landfills, while diverting organic waste to composters and biodigesters, can decrease methane emissions by 80% (60–89%), offering a mitigation potential of 760 (570–850) Mt CO2e annually.

 Prolonged low-wind events, termed wind droughts, threaten wind turbine electricity generation, yet their future trajectories remain poorly understood. Here, using hourly data from 21 IPCC models, we reveal robust increasing trends in wind drought duration at both global and regional scales by 2100, across low- and high-CO2 scenarios. These trends are primarily driven by declining mid-latitude cyclone frequencies and Arctic warming. Notably, the duration of 25-year return events is projected to increase by up to 20% under low warming scenarios and 40% under very high warming scenarios in northern mid-latitude countries, threatening energy security in these densely populated areas. Additionally, record-breaking wind drought extremes will probably become more frequent in a warming climate, particularly in eastern North America, western Russia, northeastern China and north-central Africa. Our analysis suggests that ~20% of existing wind turbines are in regions at high future risk of record-breaking wind drought extremes, a factor not yet considered in current assessments.

These data, integrated with radiogenic isotopes and elemental ratios, reveal the recycling of serpentinite-derived water in the source of the Emeishan mantle plume. Our results suggest that subduction of serpentinized oceanic lithospheric mantle can transport considerable amounts of water into the Earth’s interior, leading to localized hydration of the deep mantle, probably at the mantle transition zone.

 The El Niño-Southern Oscillation is a major driver of global climate and weather variability through atmospheric teleconnections. However, the 2023/24 El Niño event, despite ranking as the fourth strongest since 1979, exhibited an unusually weak Pacific-North American pattern. Here we show that this unexpected behavior is due to anomalously weak tropical Pacific rainfall changes, a key driver of teleconnections associated with El Niño. Through analysis of observational data during 1979–2023 and performing atmospheric model experiments, we further reveal that the suppressed tropical Pacific rainfall changes were caused by unprecedented warming in the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans in 2023. This warming, partly driven by long-term trends exceeding those in the tropical Pacific, has amplified the influence of these extra-Pacific basins on El Niño dynamics. Notably, current climate models fail to reproduce this interbasin warming contrast, highlighting critical challenges in their ability to predict future climate impacts associated with El Niño events.

 Mesopelagic fish are integral to ocean food webs and play an important role in carbon transport through their vertical migration behavior. Ocean deoxygenation caused by anthropogenic warming is expected to pose severe threats to mesopelagic fauna by enhancing physical stress and changing predator-prey relationships. In agreement with this expectation, our fish otolith record in a Mediterranean sediment core shows near absence of mesopelagic species during Sapropel deposition between ~7 and ~10 thousand years ago, concurrent with high surface productivity and low oxygenation of mid-depth waters. Instead, the otolith record is dominated by fish species adapted to epipelagic habitats, including European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and silvery lightfish (Maurolicus muelleri). Subsequent reoxygenation starting ~7 thousand years ago is accompanied by a three-fold increase in total otolith abundance. The large majority of these are mesopelagic lanternfish (Myctophidae) that dominate the otolith assemblage from the middle-Holocene to the present. Our findings corroborate expectations that future expansion of midwater deoxygenation could severely deplete mesopelagic fish communities over the coming centuries, with major impacts on marine fisheries, marine conservation, ocean food web structure, carbon storage and other marine ecosystem services.

 Urbanization has intensified in recent decades, raising concerns about increasing flood exposure in cities. Here, we assess urban flood exposure in terms of built-up area, population, and economic activity located within zones affected by 1-in-100-year river flood events. We use global historical data from 2000 to 2020 and future projections from 2030 to 2100 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. From 2000 to 2020, global urban flood exposure increased substantially, with the most severe impacts in East Asia and the fastest growth in Africa. Future exposure continues to rise, especially under high-risk development scenarios. From 2030 to 2100, flood-exposed urban area, population, and economy in Global South are more than twice, nearly five times, and over twice those in Global North, respectively. Inequality in exposure is greater within developing regions than developed ones. These disparities are projected to widen, highlighting the urgent need for targeted, region-specific strategies to reduce flood risks.

 Upscaling carbon and water fluxes measured from eddy covariance (EC) sites to regional and global scales with machine learning (ML) methods allows us to assess land-atmosphere carbon and water exchange over these broad scales. Although canopy structure and diversity are crucial in regulating carbon and water fluxes by affecting photosynthetic capacity, turbulence, and seasonal dynamics, ML-based upscaling of these fluxes has typically relied on climate forcing data and satellite-derived vegetation indices, and overlooked structural diversity. We used canopy height (RH) and foliage height diversity (FHD) data derived from NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument to investigate how ecosystem structure and diversity influence the upscaling of EC carbon and water fluxes. We combined canopy structural diversity metrics derived from GEDI, flux tower data of over 90 sites from AmeriFlux and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the Near-Infrared Reflectance of Vegetation (NIRv) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and meteorological data from Daymet. ML methods were used to develop predictive models for both gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) and to generate gridded carbon and water fluxes across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The incorporation of GEDI-derived RH and FHD improved the estimation of GPP by increasing the coefficient of determination (R2) from 0.79 to 0.91 and reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 1.77 to 1.14 gC m−2 d−1. Similarly, including RH and FHD increased R2 from 0.79 to 0.85 and decreased RMSE from 0.82 to 0.68 mm d−1 for the estimation of daily ET. Using the trained ML models, we generated gridded GPP and ET datasets with 1 km resolution and daily timestep across the CONUS for 2019–2023 (i.e., the GEDI era). Additionally, we explored effects of canopy structural complexity on ecosystem GPP and ET based on our gridded GPP and ET estimates. Annual GPP and ET showed positive logarithmic relationships with FHD, increasing with greater canopy structural complexity, though the responses weakened as FHD continued to rise. Greater canopy complexity was associated with a reduction in the seasonal variability of GPP and ET. Under severe drought events, greater canopy complexity enhanced drought resilience by reducing GPP and ET loss. Incorporating canopy structural diversity can improve the upscaling of EC carbon and water fluxes and our understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental changes."

 Gross primary production (GPP) is a key indicator of plant growth and ecosystem health, and accurately capturing its diurnal variation is crucial for understanding vegetation responses to extreme heat and drought. However, the applicability of satellite-based semi-empirical models to diurnal GPP estimation remains limited. This study refined diurnal GPP estimation in humid temperate climates by leveraging Himawari-8/9 geostationary satellite data to incorporate direct/diffuse radiation and the nonlinear GPP response to diurnal variations in absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). The eddy covariance-light use efficiency (EC-LUE) model was employed by adopting three approaches: the direct/diffuse (DD) setting to consider the direct/diffuse components of APAR, DD with nonlinear relationship (DD-NL) setting to additionally consider the nonlinear GPP-APAR relationship, and the baseline setting. The model was calibrated and validated using the eddy-covariance tower observations from 18 sites across Japan and South Korea. The DD-NL setting improved accuracy by correcting the baseline's overestimation of GPP under high APAR and underestimation under low APAR. Particularly for forest sites, the DD-NL setting reduced midday overestimations by 12–30 % on clear-sky days and morning/afternoon underestimations by 25–40 % on cloudy days. In the baseline setting, low-APAR biases progressively accumulated across daily to annual timescales, whereas the DD-NL setting reduced them to −0.10 g C m−2 day−1 and -51 g C m−2 year−1 (−2.7 % of the site's average GPP). The DD setting had minimal impact in densely vegetated sites. Our findings show that the DD-NL setting in LUE models enhances geostationary satellite-based GPP estimates across diurnal to annual timescales, supporting ecosystem monitoring during extreme events and long-term carbon assessments."

 Compared with those provided by polar-orbiting satellites/sensors (e.g., Landsat/MODIS), new-generation geostationary satellites, such as Himawari-8 and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R series (GOES-R), offer temporally continuous and much more frequent observations of the land surface over the course of the diurnal cycle. In this study, Himawari-8 land surface temperature (LST) data and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) were assimilated into a coupled two-source surface energy balance–vegetation dynamics model (TSEB-VDM) via the variational data assimilation (VDA) method to retrieve the regional sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), and gross primary productivity (GPP) (hereafter referred to as the VDAHimawari-8 scheme). Regional H, LE, and GPP values were estimated across the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in northwestern China, with a spatial resolution of 0.02° × 0.02°. Moreover, LST data from the MODIS, which is an instrument onboard polar-orbiting satellites (i.e., Terra and Aqua), were assimilated into the TSEB-VDM model (hereafter referred to as the VDAMODIS scheme) for comparison with the VDAHimawari-8 scheme. Four unknown parameters of the TSEB-VDM model, i.e., the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient (CHN), the evaporative fractions of the soil and canopy (EFS and EFC, respectively), and the specific leaf area, were optimized via the VDA approach. The estimated H and LE values were validated against ground measurements from the large-aperture scintillator, and the GPP estimates were validated against eddy covariance data at three sites (Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao) in the HRB. The results indicated that the assimilation of geostationary satellite-based LST data significantly improved the performance of the VDA model. The three-site-average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the H, LE, and GPP estimates from the VDAMODIS scheme were 45.27 W m−2, 83.77 W m−2, and 3.30 g C m−2 d−1, respectively. Compared with the VDAMODIS scheme, the VDAHimawari-8 scheme notably enhanced the performance of the VDA framework and decreased the RMSE by 15.0 % for H, 22.5 % for LE, and 38.5 % for the GPP, with an especially notable enhancement in humid (or vegetated) areas. The primary factors contributing to the enhancement in the performance of the VDA framework were the availability of much more frequent LST observations and the diurnal sampling capability of the Himawari-8 satellite."

 International interest is focusing on how to better manage soil organic carbon (SOC) to increase resilience to climate change and reinforce food security. Remote sensing imagery and visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectroscopy combined with advanced modeling algorithms can monitor SOC in an efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly manner. However, the limited bands (multi-spectral imagery) as well as the confounding effects such as soil moisture and surface roughness from the satellite may jeopardize the spectral prediction of SOC. We proposed a framework to integrate laboratory spectra with Landsat-8 multispectral data collected in natural real-environments to implement the satellite hyperspectral simulation for SOC prediction and mapping. A soil spectral library (SSL) with 873 samples containing SOC and VNIR-SWIR reflectance was developed in Northeast China. Two pixelwise temporal mosaicking approaches (i.e., averaged bare soil conditions [Median] and dry soil conditions to exclude anomalous values [R90]) were compared for creating bare soil composite images. Fractional-order derivative was explored for spectral preprocessing. Results indicated Median approach outperformed R90 regarding both spectral correlation and the validation performance for SOC. Raw reflectance after hyperspectral image simulation with 201 bands developed by random forest algorithm improved the validation R2 from 0.38 and 0.29 to 0.49 and 0.32 for Median and R90 approaches, respectively, as compared to raw reflectance with six bands. Laboratory spectra yielded higher predicted accuracy for SOC than Median-simulated, followed by R90-simulated hyperspectral images. The convolutional neural network models developed with 0.75-order, 0.75-order, and 1.25-order one-dimensional spectra had the optimal validated performances for laboratory, Median-simulated, and R90-simulated hyperspectral data, respectively, with the corresponding validation R2 values of 0.79, 0.68, and 0.54. Our study highlights that legacy SSLs show huge potential for integrating with current and forthcoming satellite multispectral images to maximize the predictive performance for SOC monitoring and mapping."

 The impacts of climate change pose significant challenges to global forest ecosystems, particularly in Mediterranean evergreen forests dominated by Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.). Since the CLMS 10-daily Gross Dry Matter Productivity (GDMP) product represents the potential productivity and, by definition, does not account for water stress, this study aims to evaluate and improve the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) estimation based on GDMP for these forests. To achieve this, we assessed the GDMP-derived GPP (RS-GPPst) against eddy covariance GPP data (EC-GPP) from six Aleppo pine forest stands across the Mediterranean basin, covering 30 site-years and spanning a climatic gradient from semi-arid to semi-humid conditions. Additionally, we analyzed the ecophysiological response of Aleppo pine to drought, focusing on environmental factors such as temperature and water stress (i.e., atmospheric based on vapor pressure deficit and edaphic based on soil water content) to refine the GPP model. Our results indicated that the RS-GPPst underestimates EC-GPP during cold periods. Using ERA5-Land data, we proposed a simplified approach to remove the temperature limitation factor and incorporated a soil water content factor, which significantly enhanced model accuracy, reduced uncertainty, and improved precision. The soil water-corrected GPP model achieved a Pearson correlation of r = 0.85, a negligible bias, and an RMSE of 1.1 gC m−2 d−1, providing a more accurate representation of GPP across varying climatic conditions. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and integrating key limiting environmental stressors, particularly water stress, into GPP models for water-limited ecosystems. The improved model, relying solely on remote sensing data without requiring in-situ measurements, offers a robust approach for large-scale carbon cycle monitoring."

 Under optimal growth conditions, net primary productivity (NPP) is a product of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (Ipar) and maximum radiation use efficiency (RUEmax; conversion of Ipar to biomass). The objective of this study was to improve and validate the RUEmax-based Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) for the determination of grassland NPP by canopy multispectral reflectance collected at field (handheld sensor) and airborne (UAV) scale considering environmental constraints. The analysis was based on multi-year field experiments on sandy loam soil in Denmark, measured shoot and estimated root biomass to calculate NPP, long-term meteorological data, and daily NPP estimated from CO2 flux chamber measurements for deriving environmental constraints.The results derived from CO2 flux data showed that NPP and plant respiration were higher in the middle of the season before the second harvest when temperature was also high. The daily maximum air temperature optimal for grass biomass production was 16.5 °C. The improved CASA model built in this study was accurate for modeling NPP at both daily (nRMSE decrease of 9 %) and seasonal (nRMSE decrease of 8–34 %) scales when considering the best environmental constraints such as maximum air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, cloudiness, and water stress, compared to no constraints. Maximum air temperature and water stress were the most important environmental constraints to the grass RUEmax. Seasonal RUEmax for modeling NPP after considering best environmental constraints was 1.9–2.7 g C MJ−1 for ryegrass and 1.9–2.2 g C MJ−1 for grass-legume mixture using the two remote sensors for measuring spectral reflectance. Over the whole growing season, tall fescue (3.1 g C MJ−1) and festulolium (2.9 g C MJ−1) obtained higher RUEmax than perennial ryegrass (2.3 g C MJ−1).This study highlights the practical implications of using the CASA model improved by maximum temperature and water stress functions for real-time, remote sensing-based assessments of grassland productivity."

 :High spatial resolution Ice/snow Surface Temperature (IST) data provides prominent advantages for polar research, such as identification of sea ice lead, monitoring of surface melting on ice shelves and variations of polynyas. As the first satellite dedicated to sustainable development goals, SDGSAT-1 is equipped with 30 m thermal infrared bands, making it highly promising for monitoring fine scale process in polar regions. In this study, an optimal IST retrieval algorithm for SDGSAT-1 was selected from ten widely used Split-Window Algorithms (SWAs), with emphasis on two key criteria: low sensitivity to emissivity and high absolute retrieval accuracy. Sensitivity analysis identified four SWAs (PR1984, VI1991, UL1994, and Enter2019) exhibited low sensitivity to emissivity and sensor equivalent noise, and thereby for subsequent validation. Evaluation using simulated data showed that the overall uncertainty of four SWAs was less than 0.2 K, with PR1984 exhibiting a slight cold Bias of −0.16 K compared to the other three SWAs. Validation using in-situ IST data indicated that the overall uncertainty for four SWAs was less than 1.7 K, with a Bias of approximately −1 K, and PR1984 showed larger Bias and RMSE. Intercomparisons among the four SWAs and cross-validation with MODIS IST also demonstrated that PR1984 had a cold Bias compared to the other three algorithms, while VI1991, UL1994, and Enter2019 showed similar accuracy. Considering that Enter2019 has stability and low sensitivity to surface emissivity, high IST retrieval accuracy, and is widely applied and well recognized as the official land surface temperature retrieval algorithm for the VIIRS sensor, this study recommends Enter2019 as the optimal IST retrieval algorithm for SDGSAT-1. Additionally, three representative application cases—identification of sea ice leads, polynya monitoring, and extraction of geothermal springs, demonstrated the application capacity of SDGSAT-1 thermal infrared data in refined monitoring of polar ice/snow surface."

 In recent years new sensors and products have been developed to advance our capabilities in assessing human activities based on the remote sensing of night lights. Correctly understanding patterns in human activity and land use based on night lights, is key to gauge our advancement in reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In this paper I focus on five challenges in remote sensing of night lights. For each of these research challenges I provide a brief review of previous work, and then demonstrate how this challenge can be tackled, using a variety of ground-based sensors (TESS-4C, LANcube, SVC-HR1024 field spectrometer and webcams), UAV imagery, and spaceborne sensors (SDGSAT-1 and VIIRS/DNB). Challenge 1: Providing a cloud mask in future night light missions; Here I demonstrate that using a thermal night time image acquired simultaneously with the night time light image (as in the case for some of the SDGSAT-1 images), a cloud mask can be created, allowing to analyze night lights over cloud-free areas. Challenge 2: Monitoring hourly changes in night lights over a single night. Here I demonstrated that using mobile measurements conducted with a LANcube photometer at different hours, it was possible to detect locations where and when night lights have decreased during the night (e.g. a large sport stadium). In addition, using a citizen science webcam, I showed that hourly changes in night lights can be discerned even from a non-calibrated camera, and that within the city of Jerusalem, where there is a large population of orthodox Jews, certain land uses had less lights during holy days. Challenge 3: Fusing night time imagery from spaceborne sensors with different overpass times and spatial resolution to better understand hourly changes in night lights; merging SDGSAT-1 images (21:30 overpass) and VIIRS/DNB images (01:30 overpass) I was able to map the turning off of street lights across rural areas in France that accelerated since the 2022 energy crisis of Europe. Challenge 4: Estimating the emissions of blue light using night light sensors; here I demonstrated that the measured portion of blue light varies between ground based and spaceborne sensors, and that it is affected by atmospheric scattering; Challenge 5: Quantifying the anisotropy of night light emissions; here I demonstrated that using panoramic images acquired from a UAV at different heights, it is possible to examine how viewing angles affect the light sources that are observed. I conclude that while the number of designated night lights sensors is still limited, with the availability of new multispectral sensors, we can advance in our understanding of the dynamics of human activities at night-time, by fusing data from different sensors, to take advantage of the unique spatial, spectral, temporal and directional capabilities of each of them."

With the development of remote sensing technology, satellite imagery provides strong support for space-based tiny ship detection. However, remote sensing images have complex backgrounds, and it is challenging to separate and locate different numbers of small ship targets in different scenarios. The thermal infrared bands can capture the temperature differences between ships and the surrounding marine environment, enabling effective detection. Therefore, this study used the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) thermal infrared spectrometer (TIS) to develop a three-channel infrared small target detection (IRSTD) dataset with pixel-level annotations for all bands (SDG-IRSTD). The dataset contains 329 images from the SDGSAT-1 TIS and 3492 targets. Then a hierarchy features attention network (HFA-Net) for space-based tiny ship detection was proposed. The network generates enhanced feature maps of different scales through the multi-level detail enhancement module (MLDEM), employs a multi-level large kernel attention module (MLLKAM) which integrates the multi-scale mechanism with large kernel attention (LKA) to effectively model long-range dependencies on feature maps with different scales, and finally achieves feature fusion and interaction of different scales through the multi-level feature fusion module (MLFFM). In addition, the HFA-Net model improved intersection over union (IoU) and probability of detection (Pd) by 2.35 % and 3.97 %, respectively, and reduced false alarm rate (Fa) by 3.29 × 10−6, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) IRSTD methods. It can achieve target localization while obtaining the overall shape of the ship, providing important support for sustainable marine safety."

 Nighttime light (NTL) imagery remotely sensed from outer space has been suggested to be a suitable proxy to investigate socioeconomic dynamics. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many studies have used NTL imagery to estimate the impacts of the pandemic. However, finer-grained analytics are rarely achieved limited by the spatial resolution of major NTL data sources. In November, 2021, the Sustainable Development Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) was launched and one of its payloads, Glimmer Imager for Urbanization (GIU) can provide 10m/40 m panchromatic and multispectral NTL images for public use. In this study, we estimate the fine-grained NTL dynamics before and after the COVID-19 surge in the city of Shanghai during the second quarter of 2022 using SDGSAT-1 GIU nighttime imagery. To distinguish the different behaviors among urban functional entities, categorized Point of Interest (POI) data are adopted. The estimation is conducted in three progressive levels: city-level, POI-class-level, and POI-object-level. To characterize each urban objects from multiple angles, two additional NTL indices, NTL and luminous area ratio composite index (NTL-CI) and NTL background relative activeness index (NTL-AI) are introduced and estimated. On the basis of raw NTL, NTL-CI further considers the change of luminous area and NTL-AI further considers the relative change to the average standard. Moreover, detailed visual observations at typical POI objects are conducted, for instance, the Shanghai Disney Resort, the Shanghai Tesla Gigafactory, and multiple cabin hospitals temporarily converted from large stadiums and exhibition centers. This study aims to present a comprehensive investigation of the socioeconomic influence of COVID-19 in Shanghai from the perspective of NTL changes in multiple granularities, and the utility of SDGSAT-1 GIU nighttime imagery in supporting SDG 3 (The Sustainable Development Goals 3: Good Health and Well-Being) is also demonstrated with this set of quantitative analytics."

 Snow algae, microscopic organisms thriving in snow-covered environments, significantly affect snow albedo and broader climatic processes. This study introduces the Algae Presence Index (API), a novel spectral tool using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to detect and classify red and green algae on King George Island, Antarctica. From 2019 to 2023, we analyzed temporal and spatial variations in algae presence during austral summers and observed corresponding reductions in surface albedo, demonstrating how algal blooms influence snowmelt. Green algae showed a stronger albedo reduction (up to 8.46 %) compared to red algae (5.33 %), emphasizing their greater role in accelerating snowmelt. The API outperformed traditional indices, such as the red/green band ratio and Red-Green Normalized Difference. It eliminated spectral overlap and accurately distinguished algae types from algae-free snow. These findings underscore the critical role of snow algae in climate feedback mechanisms and highlight the importance of monitoring their growth during Antarctic warming. This methodology provides a robust framework for assessing algae impacts on the cryosphere, with important implications for climate models and conservation."

 Rapid and accurate monitoring of surface water is critical for water resource management, environmental protection, sustainable urban development, among other issues. Landsat and Sentinel data are publicly available optical data with high spatial and temporal resolution, providing the possibility for large-scale surface water mapping. However, traditional threshold-based or supervised classification-based surface water mapping methods often require adjusting thresholds or training samples for different areas or different sensors, which may hinder the generalization performance of the method in large-scale water body mapping. To address these difficulties, we propose an unsupervised cross-sensor deep learning water bodies mapping framework (UUCP) for unlabeled large-scale optical remote sensing images. The UUCP framework adopts an unsupervised multi-segment thresholding strategy to achieve the transition from label-free learning to noisy label learning. It learns robust multi-scale features of water bodies by the developed channel attention multi-scale surface water extraction network and training strategies under noisy labels. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness was evaluated using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images from Guangzhou and Wuhan in China, and nine regions in France. The results show that our proposed method performs well in the overall performance of water extraction and is applicable to different sensors, with Kappa values reaching an average of 0.8859 and 0.8084 on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, respectively. More importantly, in cross-sensor experiments (the model trained on Landsat-8 data directly predicts Sentinel-2 dataset), the UUCP algorithm has excellent performance and is superior to other traditional water extraction algorithms. Overall, UUCP has excellent generalization ability and provides a new perspective for large-scale surface water mapping."

 Urban thermal anisotropy poses significant challenges for accurately retrieving land surface temperature (LST) in urban environments using wide-swath polar orbiters. Existing physical and kernel-driven models often require detailed urban structural and property information or rely on simultaneous multi-angle LST observations, limiting their applicability for normalizing directional LSTs across diverse urban settings worldwide. Here we propose a UNIversal, easy-To-usE Data-driven (UNITED) method for angular normalization of directional LSTs across global cities, integrating advanced machine learning techniques with multi-source remote sensing and reanalysis data. We applied this method to normalize directional urban LSTs from all available wide-swath polar orbiters (Aqua MODIS, Terra MODIS, Suomi-NPP VIIRS) on Google Earth Engine, leveraging their full archives of multi-angle observations (2003–2024 for MODIS and 2012–2024 for VIIRS). The method's high accuracy in normalizing these three products was rigorously validated using quasi-simultaneous, near-nadir LSTs from various satellite platforms (e.g., Landsat) across tens of millions of urban pixels worldwide under diverse spatial, temporal, and angular conditions. For example, for Aqua MODIS observations with viewing zenith angle exceeding ±55°, angular normalization reduces the root mean square error and bias relative to nadir VIIRS LSTs (used as the reference) from 5.71 °C and −4.92 °C to 2.43 °C and −0.40 °C, respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of the UNITED method in harmonizing directional urban LSTs.

 The seasonal freeze-thaw (FT) cycles of the permafrost active layer and seasonally frozen ground have significant impacts on ecosystems. Advances in remote sensing have enabled global monitoring of seasonal surface FT cycles. However, previous studies have generally overlooked the impact of remote sensing dataset accuracy on multiple FT parameters and have failed to sufficiently explore the changes in thawing and freezing intervals (TI/FI) in the Northern Hemisphere. This study evaluates the FT-ESDR remote sensing product using site-observed soil temperature data and provides a comprehensive analysis of surface FT characteristics in the Northern Hemisphere, with a focus on freezing and thawing intervals based on FT parameters calculated using a 15-day moving window method. The results indicate that the FT status calculated from site data shows strong agreement with remote sensing data products, with this agreement varying by season, land cover type, air temperature, precipitation. Compared to the FT parameters calculated from site data, FT-ESDR dataset underestimate several FT parameters. Combined analysis of site observation data and remote sensing data products indicates the presence of permafrost degradation, characterized by a longer thawed duration (TD), shorter frozen duration (FD), earlier start of thawing (SOT) and end of thawing (EOT), delayed start of freezing (SOF) and end of freezing (EOF), and reduced FT frequency (FTCF1/FTCF2) for both thawing and freezing seasons. The variations in FT parameters differ based on vegetation and permafrost types. The thawing interval (TI) and freezing interval (FI) show a shortening trend at most sites, indicating an acceleration of the surface thawing and freezing processes. The shortening of TI/FI during thawing/freezing is associated with increased/decreased air temperatures during the corresponding periods. Notably, the variation characteristics of sites in agricultural land differ from those in other land cover types. Overall, our results highlight the underestimation of FT parameters derived from the FT-ESDR dataset and their sensitivity to environmental factors. It also emphasizes the acceleration of surface thawing and freezing processes, which are influenced by air temperature."

 Urban greenspaces are widely recognized as an effective nature-based strategy to mitigate urban heat. However, previous studies have often oversimplified the cooling process of greenspaces, leaving their cumulative cooling effect insufficiently quantified. To address this gap, we developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) quantitative model to evaluate spatially accumulated cooling benefits. A total of 668 greenspace patches across 37 cities globally, representing varying climatic conditions, were selected. We then tested the relative importance of intrinsic drivers (landscape composition and spatial configuration) versus built environment drivers (landscape patterns of surrounding areas) in explaining the cooling effect. The results indicate that greenspaces provide an average cumulative cooling effect of 4.92 °C on the surrounding land surface temperature (LST), with a maximum reduction of up to 25.3 °C, far exceeding expectations. The cooling effect is primarily and positively influenced by patch area, the intrinsic green-blue proportion, and surrounding socioeconomic characteristics. More importantly, we emphasize the necessity of an accumulated perspective in the threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) assessments, as existing quantitative frameworks tend to largely underestimate the cooling benefits of large greenspaces. Our analysis reveals a U-shaped relationship between the aridity index and TVoE. To maximize cumulative cooling efficiency, optimal greenspace areas were identified as 2.25 ha for arid cities, 1.48 ha for semi-arid cities, 1.64 ha for dry sub-humid cities, and 1.8 ha for humid cities. This work opens new avenues for quantifying cumulative cooling effect from a 3D perspective, which may also scientifically inform urban greenspace planning and climate adaptation strategies."

 PAZ mission is an X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite launched by Spain in February 2018, capable of routinely acquiring images with high spatio-temporal resolution. In this paper, we explore the potential of spotlight-mode (HS) PAZ images for monitoring small-scale ground deformation with millimeter-level accuracy, utilizing 21 HS PAZ images acquired over the Alcoy basin (SE Spain) between September 2019 and February 2021. Phase unwrapping and long-wavelength atmospheric delays significantly impede high-accuracy estimation of small-scale ground deformation in the study area. To address these issues, we first propose an approach for correcting phase unwrapping errors in interferograms by incorporating constraints from both spatial and temporal domains. Subsequently, we propose a block-based correction algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) to mitigate long-wavelength errors in the interferograms. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively eliminate long-wavelength errors in interferograms after both traditional phase-based method and GACOS corrections, reducing the standard deviation of the interferograms by up to a maximum of 68.4 %, and a value of 37.7 % on average. External validations from GPS and topographic measurements confirm that the deformation time series derived from the proposed method show an accuracy higher than 3 mm. This means millimeter-level precision is achieved in small-scale ground deformation measurements using PAZ SAR images. The analysis of the ground deformation derived from PAZ images reveals 41 active deformation areas in the Alcoy basin between September 2019 and February 2021, each that exhibits a deformation rate exceeding 5 mm/year. Through independent component analysis (ICA) and k-means clustering, we identify three distinct temporal evolution patterns corresponding to landslide activities, land subsidence, and land settlements.

 Repetitive optical observations from satellites are crucial for monitoring earth surface dynamics over time. However, optical satellite image time series is severely affected by frequent data gaps due to clouds and shadows. While synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides cloud-penetrating capabilities to complement missing optical data, recent advancements in time series reconstruction have shifted focus from incorporating single SAR image to exploiting SAR time series. However, current methods still struggle for challenging scenarios like highly dynamic surface, persistent data gaps, and exhibit poor resilience to inaccurate cloud masks. In this research, we approach the time series reconstruction problem from the perspective of conditional generation. We propose a multimodal diffusion framework termed RESTORE-DiT, which firstly promotes the sequence-level optical-SAR fusion through a diffusion framework. Specifically, date-matched SAR time series provide under-cloud surface dynamics to guide the denoising process of cloudy areas, and date information is embedded to account for irregular observation intervals and periodic patterns. Extensive experiments on three regions have shown the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. RESTORE-DiT outperforms comparison methods by 2.87 dB in PSNR and a 27.2 % reduction in RMSE on France site. SAR and date information together increase PSNR by 2.41 dB. The reconstructed optical image time series is verified to accurately reflect the crop growth condition and support for long-term vegetation observations. In addition, RESTORE-DiT can be easily extended to other conditional reconstruction or prediction tasks for arbitrary time series image data, thus facilitating spatiotemporal analysis research.

 Daytime land surface temperature (D-LST) plays a pivotal role in regulating net ecosystem exchanges and is characterized by rapid fluctuations. Thermal infrared satellite remote sensing (TIRS) is widely used to acquire D-LST data owing to its global coverage and high-frequency observations. However, the presence of cloud cover impedes the TIRS technique by obstructing ground thermal emissions. A prevalent solution to this challenge involves correcting clear-sky surface temperatures using the cloud effect which is derived from surface energy balance (SEB) models representing distinct weather conditions. Yet, conventional methods might encounter substantial uncertainties primarily due to the oversimplified SEB modeling, which exacerbates the temperature estimation errors caused by the biases in their employed data products. This study introduces a novel SEB model termed ‘C-SWARM’, designed to reconstruct D-LST under cloudy conditions. The C-SWARM model characterizes D-LST as the result of a cloud-moderated surface warming process, with coefficients indicating the complementary mechanism for solar heating and atmospheric insulation driving surface warming throughout the day. The new model was implemented to fill missing data caused by cloud cover in the LST product of NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R), demonstrating a mean absolute error of 2.57 K and accuracy improvements of 0.38 to 1.89 K over benchmark methods at 49 flux tower sites across the contiguous United States.

 Hedgerows provide habitat and food for a wide range of species and play a crucial role for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. In addition, hedgerows render an important carbon stock, above and below ground, and protect agricultural soils from erosion. However, comprehensive, standardized and area wide information regarding the distribution of hedgerows is often lacking, which makes it hard to incorporate them in nature conservation plans and national carbon balance models. We evaluate the potential of high-resolution PlanetScope multitemporal satellite data and semantic segmentation approaches to map the distribution of hedgerows across the entire agricultural landscape in Germany. Based on a comprehensive set of independent reference data from the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein, we evaluate the performance of different loss functions and different combinations of spectral and temporal input feature sets. We assess the transferability of the final model using independent test data from three additional German Federal states. Additionally, we compare our results against the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service High Resolution Layer Small Woody Features, and a recently published biomass map of trees outside forests. All loss functions tested offered similar performance, but the binary-cross entropy function allowed for overcoming sensor artifacts to some extent. Visible and near-infrared imagery from all four monthly mosaics (April, June, August and October) of PlanetScope data was found to yield better results (F1-score 0.65) than different combinations of months and only red-green-blue inputs.

By combining our results with a digital landscape model, we reveal heterogenous estimates of hedgerow height across municipalities. Our findings highlight that semantic segmentation approaches are well-suited for area-wide hedgerow mapping, especially in combination with multitemporal high-resolution satellite data. Furthermore, we underscore the relevance of using application-specific models over post-processing existing products, and provide for the first time a spatially explicit and comprehensive overview of the distribution of hedgerows and their structure across agricultural landscapes in Germany.

 Snowmelt provides critical water resources that impact ecosystem health and hazard frequency; however, the timing of melt is difficult to infer across large spatial scales. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been used to detect snowmelt onset, the accuracy of different methodological approaches requires evaluation. We use Sentinel-1 SAR observations to estimate snowmelt timing at automated snow water equivalent (SWE) stations (n = 52) across British Columbia between 2018 and 2021. The timing of backscatter minima are compared to snowmelt onset estimates derived from continuous SWE and surface air temperature records. First, we develop a manual selection method, which requires SWE and air temperature records, to determine the feasibility of SAR for estimating snowmelt onset. Using this approach, we demonstrate that images with identical viewing geometries (i.e., those from the same orbital track) should be utilized for snowmelt onset estimation with SAR, and that including the timing of local minima, a minimum value over an interval, as potential dates of snowmelt initiation increases accuracy compared to the use of absolute minima alone. Accuracy further increases when snowmelt analysis is constrained to specific timeframes informed by region and topography, with error reduced by greater than 50 % in some study years. After demonstrating the potential accuracy of SAR with manually selected estimates (RMSE = 5.3 d), we develop an automated method that can produce SAR estimates of melt onset that are independent of surface observations. While accuracy was reduced from automated approaches, the mean date of absolute backscatter minima in track-separated SAR time series (both cross and co-polarized images) provided the most accurate automated estimates of snowmelt (RMSE = 11 d).

To address these issues, we proposed a novel spectral index called the Red-Edge reflectance Peak Width Index (REPWI) for productive waters, which is defined as the horizontal wavelength distance from the fixed wavelength of red reflectance valley (678 nm) to the intersection of the right side of the red-edge reflectance peak curve. Firstly, the bio-optical model was used to clarify the theoretical basis and relationship between REPWI and Chla. Then, in situ remote sensing reflectance and Chla data from 57 water bodies worldwide were used to calibrate and validate the REPWI-based Chla retrieval model. The REPWI-based model achieved high accuracy (coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.92, mean relative error of 26.5 %, and root mean square error of 13.7 mg/m3), significantly outperforming other spectral indices. Furthermore, REPWI maintained a strong correlation with Chla (R2 = 0.87–0.90) when applied to major on-orbit hyperspectral satellites equivalent spectra. Finally, the REPWI-based Chla retrieval model was applied to ZY1-02D hyperspectral imagery, which obtained high accuracy and demonstrated resistance to imperfect atmospheric correction. In summary, this novel hyperspectral index, REPWI, has demonstrated a solid theoretical foundation and significant advantages in monitoring Chla in productive waters."

 The hotspot-sun angular offset (the spherical circular angle between hotspot and sun positions, termed ΔCA) in urban thermal anisotropy (UTA) plays a pivotal role in advancing remote sensing of urban climates. However, its diurnal and monthly variations across scenarios influenced by sun position, urban morphology, and thermal inertia remain largely unknown. Here we filled this knowledge gap based on 1049 UTA scenarios incorporating 12 urban surface models using both computer simulations and in-situ measurements. Our findings reveal ΔCA varies from 0° to 50° (predominantly 10° – 30°). Surface thermal inertia, urban morphology (i.e., building-street aspect ratio), and sun position collectively drive ΔCA variation, with their relative contributions exhibiting significant diurnal and monthly variabilities. In general, ΔCA is most pronounced around noon with relatively low thermal inertia (279–739 W·s1/2·m−1·K−1) and low aspect ratio values (< 1.5), leading to high ΔCA values exceeding 30°. Monthly ΔCA variations shows a bimodal pattern, with peaks (ΔCA is ∼25°) in April and August and a trough (ΔCA is ∼15°) from May to July around the summer solstice when the solar zenith angle (SZA) is relatively small. Hourly ΔCA variations exhibits sinusoidal variation during daytime, also characterized by a noon trough around the summer solstice. Troughs in diurnal/annual cycles are associated with small SZA (< 20°) and high sunlit roof/ground temperatures that ensure hotspot-sun adjacency. Our results indicate pronounced ΔCAs under scenarios with lower thermal inertia, lower aspect ratio, and midday periods in May to August. Our findings could facilitate designing kernel-driven models for simulating UTA."

 42-years of Arctic and Antarctic Surface Temperatures from thermal Infrared satellite radiometers (AASTI) are presented as the Copernicus Climate Change Service Ice surface temperature record v1.1 dataset (C3S IST). It covers snow, ice and ocean surfaces with mean and max–min daily temperatures poleward of 50 degrees North and South, for the period 1982–2023. The C3S IST is provided as a Level 3 (L3) dataset in a polar 0.25 ° latitude and longitude grid. It consists of two parts: (1) the C3S IST climate data record (ISTCDR v1.1), covering the period 1. January 1982 to 30. June 2019, and (2) the C3S IST Interim CDR version 1.1 (ICDR v1.1) covering 1. July 2019 to 31. December 2023. The surface temperatures (STs) are calculated from satellite thermal infrared Brightness Temperature (TB) measurements from the Global Area Coverage – Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (GAC - AVHRR) data, creating a comprehensive data set based solely on a single sensor type. The underlying AASTI algorithm is a combination of algorithms specifically tuned for sea ice, marginal ice zone, land ice and high latitude open water. In addition, each of the algorithm coefficients are tuned specifically for each of the AVHRR instruments, using simulated Top of the atmosphere (TOA) TBs and ERA-Interim reanalysis surface and atmosphere data. Simulated TOA TB’s are computed using the community radiative transfer model, RTTOV v12.3. Spatially and temporally varying uncertainties are computed for each data-point. The C3S IST surface temperatures were validated against different in situ observation types, where comparison against radiometric temperatures from flight campaigns and ice sheet station data resulted in smaller mean differences of 0.20°C and -1.84°C in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than for validations against met station air temperatures, which were usually 1–3°C higher. Surface temperature climatology and trends have been computed for sea ice and ice sheets, showing large regional differences in surface temperature trends within the NH. For the entire dataset, the average trend is +1.11 °C/decade for the NH sea ice, +0.16 °C/decade for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) sea ice, +0.38 °C/decade for the Greenland ice sheet and -0.13 °C/decade for the Antarctic ice sheet. The positive trends are typically small during summer and larger during winter, e.g. in the Barents Sea, where trends exceed +0.3 °C/year in winter. Negative temperature trends are observed in some regions such as the Bering Strait’s ice edge. For Antarctic sea ice, the trends are generally smaller and statistically less significant than those in the NH. The trends of the ice sheet surface show a similar pattern, where the Greenland Ice Sheet has positive trends, which both are largest and most significant in the coastal areas. The Antarctic Ice Sheet has diverse trends and large areas have statistically non-significant trends, except for the negative temperature trend in the central, high altitude part of east Antarctica exceeding -0.5 °C/year."

 The Doppler shift observed by single-beam synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used to retrieve the radial velocity of ocean surface currents. However, operational marine forecasting centers require full surface current vector fields for data assimilation and forecast validation. To address this need, we propose a method to reconstruct the two-dimensional surface current vector from SAR Doppler shift measurements, under the assumption that ocean mesoscale currents are quasi-geostrophic. In this approach, the known range-directed current velocity derived from SAR Doppler shift measurements is used to estimate the azimuthal component based on the geostrophic approximation. The feasibility of the proposed method is preliminarily assessed by comparing the reconstructed surface current fields with global ocean analysis and forecast products from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The results show a bias of 0.01 m/s and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1 m/s. Additionally, surface current fields in the Gulf Stream and Agulhas Current regions are reconstructed using Sentinel-1A SAR Doppler shift observations and validated against collocated drifting buoy measurements, yielding a bias of 0.05 m/s and a RMSE of 0.19 m/s.

 The importance of conservation agriculture (CA) is undeniable, both for improving soil health and offering a viable path towards achieving carbon neutrality. However, to date, survey statistics on the extent of conservation agriculture were based on farmer declarations or field inspections. This is a major impediment to the promotion or monitoring of conservation agriculture. Here, we collected the management practices of a total of 247 fields under conservation agriculture in the Walloon region of Belgium in 2020–2021, with the aim of developing a classification model for the prediction of conservation agriculture by combining remotely sensed data with census data. We identified seven variables in the model, linked to each of the three main principles of conservation agriculture (crop diversification, maximum soil cover and minimum mechanical soil disturbance). The number of different annual crops and cereals in the rotation was obtained from the agricultural census. For the extent of soil cover, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to obtain a time series of optical remote sensing images (2015–2020, Sentinel-2, Landsat-7, Landsat-8) and precipitation data. We then analyzed the variation of spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI) and constructed indicators to distinguish between bare soil and cover crop. For minimum mechanical soil disturbance, in addition to the above data, radar data (Sentinel-1) were also obtained from the GEE platform to establish a tillage practice model. Subsequently, the Random Forest (RF) classification method was used to construct a classification model distinguishing fields under conservation from those under conventional practices. The results of a ten-fold cross-validation showed a good overall accuracy of 92 %. The model was utilized to classify the farming systems in all croplands of the Hesbaye region of Belgium. The results show that 15.5 % (2875 fields) out of 18,516 cropland fields can be classified as conservation agriculture. These fields tend to adopt non-inversion tillage and have diverse crop rotations."

 Soil moisture (SM) is a critical variable in land-atmosphere interactions. As an important passive microwave remote sensing dataset, the Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) SM has been applied in a variety of scientific studies and applications. However, due to the discontinuous coverage of satellite revisit orbits, the FY-3B SM contains a large range of data gaps, which greatly limit the applicability. To solve this problem, we proposed a one-dimensional deep learning network-based time series reconstruction model called TTP (Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-Transformer Parallel) model, which makes full use of the TCN to capture short-term dynamic changes and the Transformer to obtain long-term dependencies, thus, extracting local and global features of the one-dimensional time series simultaneously. Based on the proposed TTP model, a global, daily, spatially seamless FY-3B SM dataset from 12 July 2011 to 19 August 2019 was generated. The performance of TTP was examined using two types of experiments: 1) in-situ data validation (the in-situ data at the same location were served as the reference); 2) original FY-3B SM validation (gaps were simulated by randomly masking the observations, with the original FY-3B SM as the reference). The TTP-based global, daily, spatially seamless dataset presents great consistency with the in-situ data, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0900 m3/m3. Additionally, the reconstructed FY-3B SM based on TTP is consistently more accurate than four benchmarks (i.e., the self-supervised learning for interpolation (SSLI), the multivariate time series imputation method (MITST), the ModernTCN, and the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS)). Moreover, the reconstructed FY-3B SM demonstrates reliable accuracy across various missing data simulated with different proportions and continuous lengths. The TTP can provide methodological support for large-scale remote sensing data reconstruction, and the generated dataset can provide data support for research in fields such as soil science and hydrology.

 Reservoir drought is a valuable indicator of regional hydrological drought severity; however, it has received limited attention because of the low quality of reservoir storage data. This study proposes a Remote Sensing-Based High-Resolution Reservoir Drought Index (RS-HRDI) that integrates recent high-resolution satellite observations with historical low-resolution records to construct a long-term reservoir storage dataset. Reservoir droughts are identified by periods of abnormally low reservoir storage using a time-variant threshold. The RS-HRDI was used to detect reservoir droughts in the Yangtze River Basin, one of the most reservoir-regulated and critical river systems globally, from 2018 to 2023, including a record-breaking drought in 2022. The results indicate that the multi-satellite combination significantly improved the reservoir observation frequency from the historical monthly scale to an average of 4.3 d, enabling the detection of rapid reservoir storage reductions within days. The RS-HRDI could effectively identify droughts across various reservoirs and accurately describe their characteristics. Through comprehensive assessments of widespread reservoir networks, the aggregated RS-HRDI effectively characterized basin-scale hydrological droughts, detailing their spatial extent, intensity, and duration. Furthermore, the RS-HRDI highlighted the influence of reservoir operations on the occurrence and propagation of hydrological droughts in a river system. Specifically, upstream reservoir interception advanced downstream droughts by 2–40 d.

 Methods based on upward canopy gap fractions are widely employed to measure in-situ effective LAI (Le) as an alternative to destructive sampling. However, these measurements are limited to point-level and are not practical for scaling up to larger areas. To address the point-to-landscape gap, this study introduces an innovative approach, named NeRF-LAI, for corn and soybean Le estimation that combines gap-fraction theory with the neural radiance field (NeRF) technology, an emerging neural network-based method for implicitly representing 3D scenes using multi-angle 2D images. The trained NeRF-LAI can render downward photorealistic hemispherical depth images from an arbitrary viewpoint in the 3D scene, and then calculate gap fractions to estimate Le. To investigate the intrinsic difference between upward and downward gaps estimations, initial tests on virtual corn fields demonstrated that the downward Le matches well with the upward Le, and the viewpoint height is insensitive to Le estimation for a homogeneous field. Furthermore, we conducted intensive real-world experiments at controlled plots and farmer-managed fields to test the effectiveness and transferability of NeRF-LAI in real-world scenarios, where multi-angle UAV oblique images from different phenological stages were collected for corn and soybeans. Results showed the NeRF-LAI is able to render photorealistic synthetic images with an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 18.94 for the controlled corn plots and 19.10 for the controlled soybean plots. We further explored three methods to estimate Le from calculated gap fractions: the 57.5° method, the five-ring-based method, and the cell-based method. Among these, the cell-based method achieved the best performance, with the r2 ranging from 0.674 to 0.780 and RRMSE ranging from 1.95 % to 5.58 %. The Le estimates are sensitive to viewpoint height in heterogeneous fields due to the difference in the observable foliage volume, but they exhibit less sensitivity to relatively homogeneous fields. Additionally, the cross-site testing for pixel-level LAI mapping showed the NeRF-LAI significantly outperforms the VI-based models, with a small variation of RMSE (0.71 to 0.95 m2/m2) for spatial resolution from 0.5 m to 2.0 m. This study extends the application of gap fraction-based Le estimation from a discrete point scale to a continuous field scale by leveraging implicit 3D neural representations learned by NeRF. The NeRF-LAI method can map Le from raw multi-angle 2D images without prior information, offering a potential alternative to the traditional in-situ plant canopy analyzer with a more flexible and efficient solution."

 The Scanning Microwave Spectrometer (SCAMS) onboard the NIMBUS-6 satellite operated between 15 June 1975 and 1 June 1976. Its primary mission objective was to map tropospheric temperature profiles for improving weather predictions, measuring Brightness Temperature(s) (TBs) at five different frequencies (22.235, 31.65, 52.85, 53.85 and 55.45 GHz). However, the top-of-the-atmosphere emission measured at the 22.235 and the 31.65 GHz radiometer channels on the satellite are dominated by surface emission over polar open water and sea ice and can therefore be used for mapping sea ice concentration (SIC) on large scale (∼100 km).Here we present a SIC and ice type data set, which is based on the TB observations of the two lowest frequencies of SCAMS (center frequencies at 22.235 & 31.65 GHz). While the SCAMS channels do not completely align with the usual frequencies for sea ice retrievals (19, 22 and 37 GHz) in modern processing methods, it is still possible to apply modern techniques to reduce noise in the data. The SIC dataset provides important insights into the sea ice concentration, extent and type of the mid 1970s, where other satellite datasets e.g. the NIMBUS-5 ESMR have gaps and irregular coverage. The SCAMS data has been processed following modern methods, including a regional noise reduction over open water using a simple radiative transfer model, land-spillover corrections and estimation of uncertainties, as well as dynamical tie-points to calibrate the algorithm. The data set has been resampled into daily files with EUMETSAT’s OSI-SAF and ESA CCI compatible daily grids and land masks, for easier comparison with other data sets, such as the modern multi-frequency period starting with NIMBUS-7 SMMR in October 1978 to present and the 1972–1977 period covered by the NIMBUS-5 ESMR with some interruptions. The SCAMS TBs were processed with a hybrid SIC algorithm, combining a one and a two-channel algorithm over open water and ice respectively.We find that the SIC calculated by the two-channel algorithm has more noise over water and low SIC areas than the single-channel algorithm. However, the two-channel algorithm does not systematically underestimate SIC in regions covered by Multi Year Ice (MYI) as the single channel algorithm does. A classification of sea ice types for First Year Ice (FYI) and MYI in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) proved successful, while it was also possible to identify two surface types A and B for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) sea ice, with different radiometric signatures.A comparison of monthly mean sea ice extent (SIE) with the NIMBUS-5 ESMR showed good alignment in the both hemispheres, where the SCAMS SIE is larger by 386 676 km2 and 251 304 km2 on average in the NH and SH, respectively. SCAMS fills a gap in the N5ESMR record including the Arctic SIE minimum and the Antarctic maximum in 1975."

 To assimilate passive microwave data in numerical weather prediction, a comprehensive understanding of the components of the radiative transfer equation is essential. Given the significant variability of emissivity in snow-covered regions — affected by frequency, polarisation, and the macro- and microstructural properties of snow — attention must be paid to the design of a forward model. However, existing physical models are unsuitable for global-scale studies due to their reliance on numerous inputs, such as snow grain size across different layers, which are typically unavailable at larger scales. In this study, we propose a method that utilises geophysical properties accessible at the continental scale to derive accurate emissivity values for frequencies ranging from 1 GHz to 90 GHz, in both vertical and horizontal polarisations, with a focus on the incident angles of conical scanners (approximately 50°). Our approach employs neural networks to obtain a robust forward model using geophysical variables as input data. A training dataset was developed based on satellite-derived surface emissivity from the SMOS and AMSR2 instruments by subtracting atmospheric components and surface temperature modulation. The results, which accounts for the actual geophysical state of the surface and its temporal variability, outperform the emissivity climatologies. We achieved snow-covered surface emissivities at the continental scale with a correlation coefficient above 0.9 and a RMSE below 0.02 for frequencies up to 18.7 GHz, and around 0.03 for higher frequencies. Additionally, we demonstrate that, in a typical tundra snowpack where the macro- and microstructural properties of snow can be obtained, the emissivities retrieved by our neural network-based forward model are consistent with results from the physical model (SMRT). This proposed model will also support preparations for the CIMR mission."

 Plant water use strategies play a crucial role in regulating soil moisture, mediating plant-climate feedbacks, and influencing species competition and symbiotic relationships. However, the lack of long-term and large-scale studies on plant water sources has significantly limited comprehensive estimations of the spatiotemporal variations in plant water sources and their impacts on ecohydrological processes. To address this challenge, this study compiled literature data from 210 study regions across China and applied a multivariate random forest model to generate a 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution map of plant water source distributions in China from 2001 to 2022. The model estimated the proportions of water uptake by plants from different soil depths and groundwater, and analyzed the variations in water sources across different vegetation types, as well as the key factors influencing plant water sources. The model results aligned well with existing experimental studies, demonstrating their reliability in capturing the spatiotemporal distribution and trends of plant water sources. Nationally, plants derived on average 34.64 ± 6.45 % of their water from shallow soil (0–30 cm), 24.60 ± 3.42 % from middle soil (30–60 cm), 32.68 ± 6.74 % from deep soil (>60 cm), and 8.08 ± 4.7 % from groundwater. Significant differences in plant water sources were observed between southern and semi-arid northern regions of China, with plants in the southern regions predominantly relying on shallow and middle depth soil water, while those in the northwestern regions showed a greater dependence on deep soil water and groundwater. The correlation between soil water content and precipitation with variations in plant water sources was found to be more pronounced. Specifically, shallow soil moisture content and precipitation were positively correlated with the proportion of water absorbed by plants from shallow soil, but negatively correlated with the proportion of water absorbed from deep soil. From 2001 to 2022, there was a nationwide trend of an increased proportion of plant water uptake from shallow and deep soil layers, while the proportion from middle and groundwater decreased. This study fills a critical gap in the large-scale integrated study of plant water sources in China, providing valuable data and methodological references for related scientific research. The results of this study also contribute to the understanding of the ability to enhance vegetation adaptation to environmental changes, provide important driving data for ecohydrological model simulations and important data to support a more accurate assessment of ecosystem adaptation and water resource changes in the context of current extreme climate change."

 Canopy chlorophyll content per ground area (CCC, g·m−2) is tightly related to vegetation photosynthesis and is a promising indicator of photosynthetic capacity. However, a global operational CCC product is not yet available. To fill this gap, we developed a two-step upscaling method to estimate global CCC from Sentinel-3 OLCI top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. In the first step, a physically-based PROSAIL-D inversion model produced accurate CCC maps from over 20,000 high-spatial resolution (1 m) airborne hyperspectral images collected across 50 sites within the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) between 2019 and 2021. The validation against ground CCC measurements showed an R2 of 0.89 and an RMSE of 0.30 g·m−2. In the second step, these high-resolution CCC maps were resampled or upscaled to a spatial resolution of 300 m, and combined with Sentinel-3 OLCI TOA reflectance images to train random forest (RF) models. The RF model demonstrated robust performance with leave-one-site-out cross-validation, yielding an R2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 0.14 g·m−2. The two-step method also showed minimal sensitivity to angular effects and land cover variations, underscoring its robustness. In comparison, the traditional direct inversion method (the one-step method) led to underestimation of CCC by 0.16 g·m−2 and a moderate estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.30 g·m−2). We generated a long-term global OLCI CCC product using Sentinel-3 OLCI TOA reflectance data from 2016 to 2024, which can also be continuously updated using current data. This global CCC product can provide important plant physiological information, for parameterizing terrestrial biosphere models and capturing spatiotemporal photosynthetic patterns, thereby advancing research on vegetation carbon dynamics cycles at the global scale."

 Machine learning models have steadily improved in estimating inherent optical properties (IOPs) from remote sensing observations. Yet, their generalization ability when applied to new water bodies, beyond those they were trained on, is not well understood. We present a novel approach for assessing model generalization across various scenarios, including interpolation within in situ observation datasets, extrapolation beyond the training scope, and application to hyperspectral observations from the PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) satellite involving atmospheric correction. We evaluate five probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), including novel architectures like recurrent neural networks, for their ability to estimate absorption at 443 and 675 nm from hyperspectral reflectance. The median symmetric accuracy (MdSA) worsens from ≥25% in interpolation scenarios to ≥50% in extrapolation scenarios, and reaches ≥80% when applied to PRISMA satellite imagery. Across all scenarios, models produce uncertainty estimates exceeding 40%, often reflecting systematic underconfidence. PNNs show better calibration during extrapolation, suggesting an intrinsic awareness of retrieval constraints. To address this miscalibration, we introduce an uncertainty recalibration method that only withholds 10% of the training dataset, but improves model calibration in 86% of PRISMA evaluations with minimal accuracy trade-offs. Resulting well-calibrated uncertainty estimates enable reliable uncertainty propagation for downstream applications. IOP retrieval uncertainty is predominantly aleatoric (inherent to the observations). Therefore, increasing the number of measurements from the same distribution or selecting a different neural network architecture trained on the same dataset does not enhance model accuracy. Our findings indicate that we have reached a predictability limit in retrieving IOPs using purely data-driven approaches. We therefore advocate embedding physical principles of IOPs into model architectures, creating physics-informed neural networks capable of surpassing current limitations."

 Recently, graph clustering has been applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering and proves to be effective on capturing the complex affinity among hyperspectral samples to a certain extent. However, graph clustering based on sample-level affinity usually suffers from a heavy computation overhead due to the generation of coefficient matrices. Meanwhile, since the spatial information of HSIs may not be sufficiently utilized in these methods, it is difficult for them to obtain robust clustering performance when processing various HSIs. In order to alleviate the negative effect of sample-level affinity, we achieve evolving superpixel-level affinity (ESA) by collaboratively integrating the sample-level contrastive learning (CL) for learning discriminative features with finding the inter-superpixel good neighbors (GN) of each sample. Initially, CL is operated based on the assumption of homogeneous superpixels to pull together samples from the same superpixel and the learned features are fed to the smooth representation model to pursue the representation coefficients that used for generating GN. Then, the superpixel-level affinity is updated by simply converting the similarity between samples in each pair of GN into the similarity of the corresponding superpixels. By combining the homogeneous assumption of superpixels with the updated superpixel-level affinity, further CL is achieved to acquire more GN. In this way, CL and generation of GN works collaboratively to evolutionarily solve the superpixel-level affinity. When the process finishes, density-based spectral clustering is first implemented on several affinity matrices selected by designed growth rate of Eigenvalues of normalized Laplacian matrix to obtain clustering results of superpixels. The superpixel-to-pixels projection is then applied to these results to gain clustering maps. Finally, the majority vote strategy is adopted to realize the final clustering. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark HSIs demonstrate that the proposed ESA method is superior to the considered baseline counterparts in terms of clustering accuracy."

 The bathymetric data is of great significance to coral reef protection. Traditional measurement methods have low efficiency, high cost, and are easily affected by natural conditions. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) in the shallow water area has high efficiency. However, the accuracy of conventional single-band, logarithmic ratio, and multi-band model is easily affected by the difference of sediment types, that is, the portability of a single model is poor. It is necessary to take into account the coral reef sediment types and improve the accuracy of SDB. Fine sediment classification relies on field acoustic and spectral measurements, which is costly and subject to many restrictions. In this study, a subregional shallow water satellite-derived bathymetry method in combination with sediment information (SDB_SS) is proposed by integrating various algorithms. Firstly, based on the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery, the study area is roughly divided into six types of sediment samples: Sand, Rubble, Seagrass, Rock, Microalgae mat, and Coral / Algae. Then, the sediment pixel information is counted, and the coral reef area is divided into three sub-regions of high, medium and low reflection by threshold segmentation method. Finally, combined with ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 data, the improved subregional satellite-derived bathymetry model is constructed to obtain the shallow bathymetry results. Taking the Yongle Islands in the South China Sea as an example, root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative error (MRE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of the retrieval results are 0.97 m, 0.90 m and 21.23 %, respectively, compared with the measured depth. Compared with conventional single-band, logarithmic ratio, multi-band and other models, they are reduced by 0.27 m ∼ 1.65 m, 0.11 m ∼ 1.76 m and 2.5 % ∼ 65.27 %. It is proven that the proposed method can provide a reference for improving the SDB accuracy of coral reefs without measured spectral data."

 Accurate and timely mapping of agricultural products is a crucial component in management and decision-making for promoting food security and sustainable development. The intricacy of differentiating diverse croplands due to the existence of small and winding agricultural fragments contributes to the complexity of crop classification in arid environments. In this study, we employed a novel hybrid approach, integrating time-series analysis, noisy data quality control, and different machine learning and deep learning models to classify croplands of complex multi-crop systems in central Iran. The classification was based on time series spectral bands of Sentinel-2 images and indices of crop growth phenology, providing valuable insights into the growth cycles of different crops in the region. Additionally, a neural network-based method was used to assess and enhance the quality of training data before modeling. For crop classification, we used four machine learning and deep learning methods including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN), and compared their results before and after quality control measures. The results indicated that after quality control, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the analyses were considerably improved. RF and TCNN methods demonstrated superior prediction and modeling performance compared to XGBoost and SVM models. The overall accuracy of the four methods increased from 91 %, 87 %, 83 %, and 91 % before quality control to 96 %, 94 %, 89 %, and 95 % after quality control, respectively.

This study presents a scalable, innovative cloud and cloud-shadow masking using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with a spatially aggregated reflectance sampling approach that can robustly monitor the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and turbidity over selected sections of the study site, the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. The statistical resampling approach based on GMM was applied to Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery to produce input to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to retrieve the TSS and turbidity for target river sections. The resampled reflectance data was spatially aggregated over the selected regions of interest to further improve the input quality. Out of 80 cloud-contaminated images, we were able to use 70 images with 40%–50% clouds/cloud shadows for TSS and turbidity retrievals after applying the GMM-based masking and spatial aggregation. The resampled spectral data and in-situ TSS and turbidity measurements were used to train four ML models: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Our approach improved the estimation accuracy of the TSS by 33% and turbidity by 28% compared to the input processed using the built-in Sentinel-2 cloud and cloud shadow masks.

 Surface water resources are crucial for agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods, particularly in water-scarce regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. In Lesotho, understanding the dynamics of seasonal and perennial water bodies is vital for informed water resource management and policy development. This study evaluates spectral indices for mapping and analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water across different agroecological zones (AEZs) in Lesotho from 2016 to 2024 water years. Using harmonized Sentinel imagery integrated into a Random Forest machine-learning framework, we applied a range of water, vegetation, and soil indices to map surface water monthly and distinguish between seasonal and perennial water surfaces. Our findings reveal that the water ratio index was the most effective for mapping surface water across AEZs, outperforming others in distinguishing water from rangeland, cropland, and bare soil. Additional indices further improved water delineation in specific AEZs. Although no significant differences in classification accuracy were observed across AEZs (p > 0.05), visual inspection revealed misclassifications, mainly false positives, which could lead to overestimates of water area. Surface water trends vary regionally, with a significant increase in perennial water in the Foothills and Mountains, while seasonal water shows a non-significant decline, indicating divergent hydrological trajectories. These findings underscore the need for region-specific assessments and management strategies to address the evolving hydrological regimes.

 Frequency decomposition offers a promising approach for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) by separating anomalies from redundant backgrounds. However, an improper decomposition strategy may cause domain shifts in the low-frequency component (LFC) and excessive suppression of the high-frequency component (HFC), ultimately affecting detection performance. To address those challenges, we propose a novel frequency decomposition framework wavelet-enhanced diffusion framework for HAD, termed as WDHAD. Following a 2D discrete wavelet transformation, the LFC and HFC are processed in parallel: 1) The LFC is handled via a Low-Frequency Diffusion Model (LFDM), which employs a Low-Frequency Denoising Autoencoder (LFDAE) with spatial-frequency attention to recover key features and remove background noise. 2) The HFC is processed through a High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM) that preserves edges and textures to improve anomaly detection. Both components are then fused and passed through a 2D inverse wavelet transformation, with the detection map obtained by a Reed-Xiaoli detector. In addition, a negative log-likelihood noise loss is introduced to model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on six public and two real-world UAV datasets demonstrate that WDHAD achieves robust generalization and cross-domain adaptability.

 Data-driven models applied to landslide prediction have historically been mostly confined to the pure spatial context, as per landslide susceptibility requirements. Its standard definition assumes that the occurrence probability is conditional on a broad set of static predictors and that in turn, it does not change with time. To find data-driven models where the probability is temporally dynamic, we need to explore early-warning systems. However, these models traditionally rely only upon rainfall (intensity-duration characteristics) and neglect influences from terrain, geological, and other thematic contributors. Space-time data-driven models can incorporate both static and dynamic predictors, allowing for a rich description of the landslide process and for the susceptibility to change both in space and time. In this work, we present an overview of potential variations of space–time landslide susceptibility models for an area in Chongqing, China. In doing so, we present space–time models suited for long-term (yearly or seasonal models) or short-term (monthly or daily) planning.

Recent studies leverage the growing volume of GNSS-R measurements with data-driven approaches to enhance retrieval products over both ocean and land.

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we fine-tune the pretrained model on various downstream retrieval tasks, including ocean wind speed retrieval, surface soil moisture estimation, and vegetation water content prediction.

 Ensuring fairness in machine learning applications is critical, yet it remains underexplored in crop type mapping. While the consequences of imbalanced classes for supervised classification tasks are known to the field of Earth Observation, assessing classification results for sub-groups of societally sensitive attributes, such as parcel size in crop mapping, have received little attention. To address this gap, we evaluate established class imbalance correction methods: Random Oversampling (RO), Weighted Cross Entropy (WCE), and Focal Loss (FL); and two novel approaches that target both class imbalance and the performance disparity between small and large parcels: Random Oversampling with Resampling (RO-R), and Double Objective Weighted Cross Entropy (DOWCE). RO-R increases the representation of smaller parcels by redistributing random samples, whereas DOWCE applies higher penalties to the misclassification of smaller parcels. Hybrid methods (RO-DOWCE and RO-FL) were also evaluated. To assess their generalizability under varying conditions, the methods were tested on ten diverse datasets subsampled from the BreizhCrops dataset, covering Brittany, France. Results showed that RO-DOWCE was the most effective method at addressing class imbalance across the datasets, though not significantly different from RO-R, RO, and RO-FL. Additionally, cost-sensitive methods were generally less efficient at addressing class imbalance than sample balancing and hybrid approaches.

 Surface water monitoring is fundamental for managing water resources and sustaining life in arid regions worldwide. Egypt is an arid country in Northern Africa, and the surface water is critical for ecosystem health, agricultural production, and human livelihoods. During dry seasons, Egyptian water bodies exhibit unique challenges for remote sensing detection due to their significant spectral differences, complex morphological patterns, and numerous small streams. However, existing water detection methods face challenges in accurately identifying water bodies with high spatial and spectral variability, especially in arid regions during dry seasons. This paper proposes an improved U-Net model with multi-scale information and attention mechanism for precise surface water mapping by multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The extraction accuracy can be improved by combining convolutional layers for local feature extraction with Vision Transformer using Manhattan self-attention for global context information. Our model attains optimal performance with IoU, F1-score, recall, and precision reaching 94.26%, 97.05%, 98.18%, and 95.94%, respectively, compared to traditional machine learning methods, particularly in challenging areas with small water bodies, complex backgrounds, and eutrophic water boundaries. Our results demonstrate that integrating multi-scale information with channel and spatial attention mechanisms can effectively address the challenges of water extraction from arid environments. This advancement in remote sensing-based water extraction could enhance water resource management in arid regions globally, contributing to the monitoring and conservation of precious water resources amid increasing environmental variability."

 The choice of transportation mode by residents significantly affects road traffic carbon emissions. Recent studies have explored the carbon reduction effects of green travel behaviors, such as bicycle-sharing and metro travel. However, there remains a gap in research estimating the carbon reduction potential associated with the transition from motorized transport to low-carbon alternatives. In this study, we propose a carbon emission reduction scenario simulation framework based on vehicle trajectory big data. This framework is designed to evaluate the impact of shifts in residential travel modes on carbon emissions at a fine spatial and temporal scale. Our analyses indicate that only 7.2 % of car trips are suitable for a shift to active transportation options, while over 64 % of trips qualify as multimodal, particularly involving e-bikes in combination with metro, which can result in annual carbon reductions of up to 3,138 tons. This highlights the importance of multimodal transport in reducing transportation-related carbon emissions. Regarding the spatial pattern, peripheral areas present substantial carbon reduction potential, accounting for nearly 50 % of the total. Moreover, significant carbon reduction potential exists in road sections connecting central and peripheral areas. In terms of timing, we observe two peaks in emission reductions on weekdays, occurring between 7–9 AM and 4–6 PM, with an additional peak on weekends around 9 PM. Ultimately, our research highlights that multimodal transportation, especially the combination of walking or conventional cycling with metro, may offer greater carbon reduction efficiency than relying solely on active transportation options. The findings of this study can significantly inform urban transportation policy-making and guide residents toward sustainable travel choices."

 Driven by artificial intelligence technologies, geospatial representation learning has become a new trend to better understand urban systems. Points of Interest (POI), as the current mainstream data in urban studies, plays an important role in these methods to discover urban characteristics. Existing studies on POI representation learning focus on spatial and type information, but overlook heterogeneous semantic interaction between POIs as well as hierarchical associations among types. To tackle these two problems, we propose a novel approach, called POI Dual Context Aware Neural Network (DCA) for learning POI representations by jointly embedding both spatial context and type context. For the spatial context of POIs, we introduce a distance decay effect constrained graph attention network as an encoder of DCA, which takes the heterogeneous semantic interaction and spatial proximity of POIs into account. For the type context of POIs, we propose a type hierarchical aggregation neural network architecture for DCA, and design a type infomax optimization objective following contrastive learning mechanism. The superiority of DCA is demonstrated in three geographic mapping tasks, including urban function mapping, region popularity mapping, and housing price mapping. This study provides a new insight to mine deep information from POIs, contributing to a better understanding of urban systems. The source code is released at http://github.com/quan-qin/DCA."

 Urban functional zones shape both the configuration of the physical environment and the ways individuals perceive and interact with urban spaces. However, the nonlinear associations between zone-specific objective features (e.g., greenery, traffic lights) and subjective perceptions (e.g., beauty and boredom) remain underexplored. This study proposes an analytical framework to investigate such associations in Beijing, China, by integrating street view images (SVIs), panoptic segmentation, and machine learning models. Specifically, we extracted nine objective features and six subjective perceptions from SVIs and modeled their nonlinear associations across different functional zones using 36 XGBoost models combined with SHAP analyses. Model performance was robust, with XGBoost achieving the highest average R2 (0.221) and one of the lowest average RMSE values (0.031) compared to four baseline machine learning models, underscoring its generalizability across perception dimensions and functional zone types. The results reveal three key findings. First, road users and safety barriers consistently ranked among the top contributors to subjective perceptions across all functional zones, while elements like traffic signs exhibited zone-specific effects. Second, the nonlinear associations exhibited varying threshold effects across functional zones, highlighting the context-dependent influence of environmental factors; for example, greenery visibility reduced safety perception in residential zones but enhanced it in commercial zones. Third, typical nonlinear patterns, including V-shaped and threshold effects, were observed, reflecting phenomena such as sensory saturation and diminishing marginal utility. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between urban form and human perception, offering insights for adaptive, human-centric urban design strategies."

 Soil moisture change and surface erosion provide unique insight into the evolution of desert ecohydrology and geomorphology in hyper-arid areas under increasing hydroclimatic extremes. However, the spatial and temporal distributions of the transitional changes in soil moisture and surface erosion associated with sparse rainstorm events are not yet well-characterized due to the low spatial resolution (a few kilometers) of the current microwave radiometer and scarce temporal acquisition and SAR orbital observations, respectively. To address this deficiency, we apply three processing techniques to monitor these changes at a spatial resolution of 45–105 m and with a limited dataset covering four precipitation events of different magnitudes over the hyper-arid Qatar peninsula from 2017 to 2019. Two of the techniques are based on radar interferometric coherence using Sentinel-1C-band satellite data, as the investigated rainstorm events generate measurable isolated changes in the time-series coherence associated with variations in transient soil moisture and surface erosion. The third technique employs soil moisture indices derived from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral satellite imagery. Our observations indicate that the timing of satellite acquisitions relative to a rainstorm is the primary factor in selecting the appropriate technique for identifying soil moisture change, surface erosion, or both. As a result, we integrate these three techniques into a decision-tree to guide users in their methodological choices. Moreover, this decision-tree approach can further improve the assessment of erosion hotspots, flood risks and ecohydrological and geomorphological changes of deserts caused by the current fluctuations in rainstorm events over hyper-arid areas due to hydroclimate volatility."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), as an active remote sensing technology with all-weather and all-time capabilities, plays an essential role in environmental monitoring and disaster management. However, SAR employed the coherent imaging mechanism to synthesize images, inevitably introducing speckles in the obtained images. These speckles reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of an image due to the random variation of image pixel value, which brings challenges for subsequent applications. The breakthrough of image registration provides the data requirements for acquiring multi-source remote sensing data. Based on the above study, this paper presents a Gradient Consistency constraints semi-supervised network for Optical image-Assisted SAR despeckling (GCOANet). The presented method generates cross-domain reference images by utilizing optical pixel correlation to conduct the paired SAR reconstruction, thereby mitigating feature misalignment caused by the modal differences between SAR and optical imagery. The conditional diffusion model is then employed to learn the mapping between the SAR and reference images, eliminating the necessity for paired SAR/optical data. The reference image is first generated using a pre-trained conditional diffusion model during the training and test phase. Subsequently, a multi-scale blind spot despeckling network is designed to suppress speckles by fusing SAR and reference features, while also preventing the loss of blind pixel information. Finally, an all-directional gradient loss is proposed to rapidly differentiate homogeneous and heterogeneous regions and achieve separate speckle suppression. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and simulated data verify the effectiveness of the presented method, which retains complete texture details and smooth homogeneous areas. Furthermore, the related applications further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in real-world scenarios."

 Remote sensing has revolutionized crop mapping and monitoring, providing valuable insights for sustainable agricultural practices. However, successfully implementing remote sensing-based crop type identification in tropical regions remains challenging. Unlike temperate regions, tropical areas benefit from favorable weather conditions that support diverse land management practices, resulting in complex crop dynamics that are difficult to model. Additionally, frequent cloud cover in tropical regions limits the use of optical data during extended periods of the year, making SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) a more attractive alternative. Traditional models like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been useful in classifying crop types using spatial and temporal contexts. However, these models often use fixed inputs, optimizing them towards a specific task, and fail to consider the CRFs’ feedback for end-to-end learning features and the spatiotemporal dependencies. This work addresses this gap by introducing an end-to-end hybrid model that combines deep learning with CRFs to incorporate prior knowledge-based modeling of crop dynamics. The proposed framework integrates a backbone encoder–decoder to capture spatial and temporal contexts, with a CRF block that models temporal dynamics by accounting for label dependencies between adjacent epochs. This block facilitates the integration of both data-driven and expert-domain temporal constraints, allowing the framework to adapt to local agricultural practices and enhance crop dynamics modeling. We evaluate the framework using multi-temporal SAR image sequences from two municipalities in Brazil, comparing the effectiveness of learned versus prior-knowledge temporal constraints. The results show improvements of up to 30% in per-class F1 score and 12% in average F1 score compared to a baseline model that excludes temporal dependencies. These findings highlight the value of incorporating prior knowledge-driven temporal constraints into crop mapping models."

 Deep learning approaches have gained prominence for automatic glacier boundary extraction due to their localized nature of convolutional operations, potentially leading to incomplete or fragmented glacier pixel representations. Moreover, the accuracy of extracting glacier boundaries from a single remote sensing image (RSIs) is often influenced by seasonal snow, clouds, shadows, and frozen lakes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel model for extracting the non-debris-covered areas of glaciers (NDCAG) from RSIs, termed GlacierSTR-UNet. This model enhances information flow and overall performance by embedding the Swin Transformer (ST) as an encoder into a U-shaped architecture and reduces training time and improves gradient handling by incorporating the ResNet block in the decoder. We deploy the GlacierSTR-UNet model on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to efficiently generate multiple NDCAG results from RSIs taken at different periods. A pixel-by-pixel synthesis algorithm is then applied to aggregate the multiple NDCAG extraction results, producing the final NDCAG. Accuracy assessments indicate that GlacierSTR-UNet achieves an overall accuracy of 0.8817, and the relative deviation between automatically extracted and manually interpreted NDCAG remains within 2 %. Finally, we obtain the NDCAG datasets for the periods of 2015/2016 and 2022/2023 in High-Mountain Asia, revealing a reduction of 4,185.12 ± 7,870.96 km2 in NDCAG from 2015/2016 to 2022/2023.

This research aims to develop a method for fine-scale monitoring of grounded ice cliff calving using multi-temporal UAV photogrammetry without ground control points, with assistance from in-situ snow pit measurements. The methodology involves co-aligning UAV images to create consistent 3D models, followed by detecting calving events based on significant local volume changes between successive models. Noise filtering strategies were implemented to exclude outliers, and calving volume and mass were calculated using measurements of snow depth and density. Our method was conducted near the China’s Qinling Station on Inexpressible Island in Victoria Land, East Antarctica, and achieved a co-alignment accuracy of 2.69 cm.

 Land degradation poses a significant threat to ecosystems and livelihoods, particularly in disaster-prone regions. In these settings, the promotion of certain agricultural practices with economic incentives, such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) farming, offers a potential solution for enhancing economic stability and mitigating environmental degradation. Despite its promise, the effectiveness of sugarcane as an agricultural intervention remains understudied, especially regarding its environmental benefits. Our study evaluates the impact of sugarcane cultivation in western Nepal, a region highly vulnerable to soil erosion and riverbank degradation due to the presence of flood-prone landscapes. We conducted a geospatial impact evaluation (GIE), which integrated remote sensing data and econometric techniques, including optimal full matching (OFM) and difference-in-differences (DID). We assessed the causal impact of a program promoting sugarcane farming on its adoption and environmental outcomes, measured using multi-temporal satellite imagery, crop phenology, and clustering algorithms, along with machine learning and visual interpretation methods. Our results show that sugarcane adoption increased significantly in both treated and spillover communities, highlighting its potential as a sustainable agricultural practice. However, while uptake was evident, the expected environmental outcomes, such as soil erosion control and riverbank stabilization, did not materialize.

 The increasing complexity and scale of remote sensing datasets, coupled with the challenges of accurately estimating algorithmic time efficiency, often lead to significant resource waste or even failure when using machine learning algorithms in urgent or resource-constrained scenarios. Accurate time efficiency estimation is critical for deploying effective algorithms, yet it remains challenging due to the many factors influencing computational performance. Traditional methods of evaluating time efficiency often neglect the effects of core model parameters and complex data scales in spectral and temporal dimensions. In addition, inference time, an essential factor in real-world applications, is often overlooked. To address these limitations, we propose the Time Efficiency Assessment Framework (TEAF), a novel method for evaluating the time efficiency of machine learning algorithms. Through mathematical reasoning, TEAF models the training and inference time as functions (ψ) of complex data scales and core model parameters. The strong linear correlation between ψ and the actual runtime allows TEAF to accurately predict the time and cost of machine learning tasks with a low computational overhead before algorithm execution. To validate this framework, we derived TEAF formulations for five classical machine learning algorithms and tested them on state-of-the-art hyperspectral image datasets and Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets. The results demonstrated that TEAF could accurately predict both training and inference time for various algorithms, with a strong linear correlation between ψ and actual runtime (R2>0.942). This study offers a practical solution to the challenges posed by the increasing volume and complexity of data in remote sensing image processing.

 Agriculture forms the backbone of Egypt’s economy, with the Nile Valley and Delta serving as key production zones for crops like wheat, rice, and clover. However, the sector faces mounting pressure from water scarcity, as it depends almost entirely on the Nile for irrigation, making it necessary to map major crops for assessing Water Use Efficiency (WUE) and informing agricultural planning. In this study, we used machine learning (ML) techniques—specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) to time-series phenological data and optical indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Bare Soil Index (BSI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI)) to map major crop types—specifically rice (a summer crop),wheat and clover (winter crops) —across entire Nile Basin in Egypt. Training and testing showed satisfactory performance, with testing accuracy ranging from 0.73 to 0.82 and training accuracy from 0.70 to 0.90. In addition, this study evaluates responsiveness of crop WUE to Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) and other meteorological and biophysical factors—including solar radiation, precipitation, maximum temperature, gross primary productivity, and evapotranspiration. Our findings confirm VPD as dominant factor affecting WUE, with a 3.5 kPa threshold beyond which WUE no longer responds, signaling a physiological limit for water management. The projected VPD trend, based on ensemble analysis of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, indicates an increase in number of months with high VPD in future, reinforcing the need for adaptive irrigation strategies in the region."

Furthermore, 13 conditioning parameters were chosen via multicollinearity evaluation.

Model performances were adjudged using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC/ROC) ratings and the overall best-performing model with a predictive accuracy of 99.6% was selected. Based on the findings, CCM’s total area was categorized into very low (20.0%), low (22.1%), moderate (20.2%), high (18.8%), and very high (18.9%) susceptibility zones. Moreover, the resultant map revealed middle portions down to the coast are most sensitive to floods compared to the northern part due to flat slope surfaces, decreasing vegetative cover, and low elevated lands.

 Building height significantly influences urban development and evolution. Previous studies on building height estimation using digital surface models (DSMs) have predominantly addressed simple, single-environmental scenarios, often yielding unsatisfactory results across diverse environments. This study introduces a novel method for estimating building height by integrating scene classification with spatial geometric relationships. Initially, raw data are processed to derive the various data types required for this approach. Environmental scene classification, based on vegetation and shadows analysis, is then performed. Subsequently, the building height is estimated either directly from the DSM or through road height prediction. The proposed method is validated using a scene image from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The results demonstrate that the estimated building height maintains high accuracy in complex environments with significant vegetation and shadow coverage, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.84 m.

 Accurate and timely information on the spatiotemporal distribution of crops is essential for sustainable agricultural practices and ensuring food security. The significant challenges persist in accurately classifying crop types in highly fragmented cropland regions characterized by small field sizes, complex landscapes, and highly frequent cloud cover. This study presents a novel classification workflow designed to generate archaic/historic and reliable land cover (LC) maps from integrating time series data from multiple EO sources—Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and the Highly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HISTARFM)—with the Random Forest (RF) classifier and cloud computing technology. To the evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, Northeast (NE) Thailand was selected as a case study region, focusing on the classification of 14 crop types between 2021 and 2023. Different combinations of EO datasets and a RF classifier were evaluated using a substantial dataset of 13,453 reference points. The crop type/LC transitions from 2021 to 2023 were then analysed and a temporal transfer model was employed to map historical crop fields. The combined all EO datasets in this work achieved high overall accuracy and F1 scores (>85 %) with the high spatial consistency of crop fields when compared to the use of combined both datasets. Results demonstrated the high potential and excellent efficiency of the RF, utilising an extensive reference dataset and the continuous temporal monthly information of gap-filled data. The most dominant crops were rice, followed by cassava, sugarcane and rubber trees throughout the three study years. The transfer learning RF model proved effective in mapping historical crop types and LC even when ground data was limited. Transitions of 7,287 km2 (∼5%) appeared from 2021 to 2022, with major crop decreases in rice and sugarcane. From 2022 to 2023, cropland changes totaled 8,466 km2 (∼6%), primarily as reductions in sugarcane and rubber trees. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating multiple EO datasets in this study for mapping crop types across large areas and confirm the benefit of using monthly temporal data to obtain historic LC maps, providing valuable insights for a large range of stakeholders."

 Land use/land cover (LULC) classification based on deep learning techniques is a significant research area for analyzing high-resolution remote sensing(HRRS) images. However, due to the limitation of available samples and model feature extraction capability, the current deep learning methods suffer from weak generalization ability for widespread and effective application across diverse HRRS scenarios. To address this problem, we propose an innovative network model named multi-level feature adaptation-segment anything Model (MLFA-SAM). The model employs a three-level fine-tuning strategy to adapt the SAM foundation model for remote sensing LULC classification. The proposed MLFA-SAM significantly enhances high-precision classification performance across diverse HRRS scenarios. Specifically, the domain distribution shift adaptation (DDSA) level is designed to adjust the input image modality for SAM and initially extract features and overcome the domain distribution shift between remote sensing images and the natural images used by the SAM. Then, we designed depthwise low-rank adaptation (DLRA) strategy to optimally fine-tune the frozen SAM parameters. Finally, we improved SAM’s mask decoder to generate high-quality multi-class masks required for LULC classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the MLFA-SAM model surpasses several existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods on the HRLC dataset and the ISPRS Potsdam dataset. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MLFA-SAM, with its concise yet efficient architecture, achieves 66.77% mIoU and 86.02% OA on the HRLC dataset. Notably, the integration of near-infrared (Nir) bands further enhances its performance to 68.43% mIoU and 87.91% OA. The generalization test on the LoveDA dataset, along with four test HRRS images exhibiting spatiotemporal and semantic scene differences, further demonstrate that MLFA-SAM possesses a stronger generalization ability compared to existing methods and shows greater potential for practical applications."

 Climate change is dramatically shifting the distribution and prevalence of pests and diseases, posing significant threats to global forest ecosystems.

For each DM, three ML algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks) were trained using in situ leaf rust inspections as reference data, and the following inputs: (i) inverted plant traits retrieved from the PROSAIL model, (ii) key spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 time series, and (iii) a combination of both plant traits and indices from Sentinel-2 images. The best-performing DM, which combined plant traits and spectral indices, achieved an overall accuracy of 89.5 % (Kappa = 0.78) across three tested ML algorithms. Relative importance analysis highlighted chlorophylls (21 %), carotenoids (16 %), and leaf water content (11 %) as the most critical variables for rust detection.

Our approach also highlights how key plant traits, such as chlorophyll, carotenoids, and leaf water content, vary across poplar clones, offering valuable insights for forest management and conservation strategies in the context of climate change.

 The accurate extraction of building roof structures from aerial imagery represents a fundamental task for urban digital twin systems, facilitating critical applications such as 3D city modeling and solar potential assessment. Despite recent advancements in geospatial artificial intelligence, existing methods frequently encounter challenges posed by real-world complexities. These include structural heterogeneity caused by diverse architectural styles, discontinuities in roof structures due to occlusions from vegetation and other obstacles, and the limited generalization ability of models stemming from the scarcity of specialized annotated datasets. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end network called RoofMapNet, specifically designed for extracting roof structures. First, we propose a strategy for roof junction extraction that integrates dynamic Gaussian heatmaps with quadratic coordinate calibration. This strategy enhances the model’s robustness in junction prediction under heterogeneous sample distribution scenarios. To address the loss or blurring of roof lines caused by occlusion and shadow, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware module. This module employs a bidirectional mapping between geometric and feature spaces to refine candidate lines accurately, thus improving the model’s generalization ability and robustness in roof line detection. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of roof structure detection models, we meticulously annotated a diverse, large-scale remote sensing imagery dataset for roof structure extraction, named RoofMapSet. Comprehensive evaluations on the VWB and RoofMapSet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with mean sAP improvements of 4.13% and 2.85% over competitors, respectively.

 Obtaining regional fine-scale daily Soil Moisture (SM) data is crucial for better understanding carbon and water cycles. Currently, downscaling from passive microwave SM products has become the most commonly utilized approach for generating regional high-resolution SM data, while retrieving SM based on disaggregated brightness Temperature (TB) data gains litter attention. Besides, the relative potentials of these two downscaling approaches remains largely unknown. Therefore, this study comprehensively compared the relatively performances of the two downscaling schemes namely the “retrieving-then-downscaling” and “downscaling-then-retrieving” over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Evaluation results showed that retrieving SM using disaggregated TB significantly outperformed the popular passive microwave SM downscaling method. The averaged R and ubRMSE metrics for downscale-first based SM were 0.62/0.74 and 0.051/0.038 m3/m3 at station/network scales, and were 0.58/0.70 and 0.056/0.041 m3/m3 for the retrieval-first based SM, respectively. Spatially, the downscale-first based SM had lower uncertainty than the retrieval-first based SM over nearly 70 % areas of the QTP. However, due to the strong vegetation scattering effect, it showed two times larger uncertainty than the retrieval-first based SM over densely vegetated regions in the east and southeast. In addition, satisfactory TB downscaling performance could be achieved by leveraging machine learning algorithms and multiple covariables, but need to further reduce additional errors. The superiority of “downscaling-then-retrieving” scheme was independent of models selected for downscaling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the great potential of “downscaling-then-retrieving” method and provides a new insight for generating regional SM data at fine scale."

 Individual trajectories offer insights into human mobility, with data either passively recorded, such as GPS, or actively recorded, such as natural language text. While the former provides detailed movement data, it lacks important context such as personal experiences, which can be obtained from the latter. Extracting trajectories from text can enhance travel experience optimization, historical analysis, and pandemic management. However, existing trajectory extraction methods rely on rule-based frameworks that fail to capture contextual semantics, resulting in limited generalizability and loss of trajectory semantics. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential for contextual reasoning capabilities, their deficient domain-specific knowledge pertinent to trajectory patterns hinders efficient and precise trajectory extraction. To address these limitations, we propose T2TrajLLM, a novel framework that fuses LLMs with domain knowledge through three components: (1) a lightweight trajectory model for structured guidance, (2) a text-to-trajectory transformation model enabling multi-step reasoning, and (3) labelled text-trajectory samples for learning domain-adaptive constraint rules. Central to T2TrajLLM is a prompt method that dynamically fuses these components with LLMs while avoids rigid rule dependency. Evaluated across three heterogeneous datasets, T2TrajLLM achieves ∼8 % higher accuracy than existing methods, demonstrating strong transferability across datasets and extensibility to diverse application requirements.

 Monitoring wildfires has become increasingly critical due to the sharp rise in wildfire incidents in recent years. Optical satellites like Sentinel-2 and Landsat are extensively utilised for mapping burned areas. However, the effectiveness of optical sensors is compromised by clouds and smoke, which obstruct the detection of burned areas. Thus, satellites equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), such as dual-polarisation Sentinel-1 and quad-polarisation RADARSAT-1/-2 C-band SAR, which can penetrate clouds and smoke, are investigated for mapping burned areas. However, there is limited research on using compact polarisation (compact-pol) C-band RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) SAR data for this purpose. This study aims to investigate the capacity of compact polarisation RCM data for burned area mapping through deep learning. Compact-pol m-χ decomposition and Compact-pol Radar Vegetation Index (CpRVI) are derived from the RCM Multi-Look Complex product. A deep-learning-based processing pipeline incorporating ConvNet-based and Transformer-based models is applied for burned area mapping, with three different input settings: using only log-ratio dual-polarisation intensity images, using only compact-pol decomposition plus CpRVI, and using all three data sources. The training dataset comprises 46,295 patches, generated from 12 major wildfire events in Canada. The test dataset includes seven wildfire events from the 2023 and 2024 Canadian wildfire seasons in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec and the Northwest Territories. The results demonstrate that compact-pol m-χ decomposition and CpRVI images significantly complement log-ratio images for burned area mapping. The best-performing Transformer-based model, UNETR, trained with log-ratio, m-χ m-decomposition, and CpRVI data, achieved an F1 Score of 0.718 and an IoU Score of 0.565, showing a notable improvement compared to the same model trained using only log-ratio images (F1 Score: 0.684, IoU Score: 0.557).

 α-Pinene is one of the most important precursors of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). The formation of α-pinene derived SOA is strongly affected by NOx. However, the effects of NOx on α-pinene derived SOA formation, especially the enhancing effect of NOx on SOA yield, are still not comprehensively understood. A series of α-pinene photooxidation experiments were performed at different NOx concentrations through an atmospheric chamber in this study. The yields of α-pinene SOA initially increased with rising NOx concentrations but subsequently decreased at higher levels. The maximum SOA yields were 8.0 % and 26.2 % in 115 ppb and 250 ppb α-pinene experiments, respectively. It is found that the fitted curves of SOA mass concentration (M0) versus SOA yield shift downward with increasing NOx, which means the volatility of the oxidation products gradually increases. However, the higher SOA yields observed with the increasing M0 during each photooxidation process, which were attributed to the enhanced gas-to-aerosol-phase partitioning ratio. The relationship of SOA yields with M0 for different NOx experiments shows that, under low-NOx conditions, the elevation in M0 which was driven by enhanced VOC consumption would still promote SOA yield with increasing NOx concentrations, despite the position of the Odum curve shift downward. That is to say, the change of M0 leading to the variation gas-to-aerosol-phase partitioning ratio should be taken into account in the facilitation of NOx on SOA yield. The relation of nitrogen-containing organic compound (NOCs) concentrations with NOx was also quantified in this study.

 sThis study aimed to explore the link between hospitalizations due to RSV infection and factors such as climate and air quality among children in Guangzhou. We included RSV infection cases from January 2017 to October 2023 in a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, China, and then collected daily meteorological data including air temperature and relative humidity as well as air pollutant data including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2. Finally, we established a distributional lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to investigate the association of hospitalization for RSV infection with meteorological factors and air quality. Of the 1922 reports of RSV infection collected, 96.31 % of the infections were under 5 years of age. Our study revealed a correlation between reductions in air temperature and relative humidity and the rise in hospitalizations due to RSV infection. With respect to air quality, high concentrations of PM2.5, O3, and NO2 increase the risk of RSV infection, with the relative risk increasing with pollutant concentration. In addition, a 3-week exposure to moderate concentrations of PM2.5 (17-23 μg/m3) also increased the risk of RSV infection. For other air pollutants, there is no obvious pattern found."

 Accurate pixel-scale precipitation estimation is essential for hydrological modeling and water resource management, underscoring the need for improved bias correction (BC) and data fusion techniques. This study evaluates several BC methods—including Classic and Orographic approaches—and examines Multiple Collocation (MC) and Triple Collocation (TC) for data fusion and error analysis. Ten satellite-based precipitation products are assessed alongside gauge-based methods (PRISM and Modified Inverse Distance Weighting, MIDW) across three diverse watersheds: Urmia, Karkheh, and Tashk-Bakhtegan.

 In recent years, the frequency of Dry-wet abrupt alternation (DWAA) has gradually increased. However, the climate factors of the spatio-temporal pattern of DWAA events on a national scale are still not well understood, and the research on the correlation of DWAA with rain belt/season in China has not been investigated so far. This study explored the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of the frequency, intensity, and alternation timing of DWAA events over the whole China during 1961–2018, and then intensively investigated the relationship between the changes of DWAA and the summer rain belt/season in the whole China. The research results can be summarized: (1) The DWAA events primarily occurred in the eastern China, the frequency of wet-to-dry (WTD) events declined significantly from 1961 to 1990, and future trends in DWAA frequency and intensity are expected to follow the historical patterns in the whole China. The intensity of DWAA events with alternation timing in May and August was stronger than that in June and July. (2) In the eastern China, the alternation timing of dry-to-wet (DTW) events and WTD events corresponded well to the advance of summer rain belt, and the alternation timing of DWAA during 1991–2018 occurred earlier than that in 1961–1990, driven by the decadal advance of the onset of the SCSSM. In the western China, the alternation timing of DWAA was aligned with the seasonal shift between the rainy and dry periods. (3) The five Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) indices showed a strong correlation with DWAA in the eastern China, and a weaker correlation in the western China. Moreover, the correlation between DWAA and WPSH in the eastern China strengthened in 1990–2018 compared to that in 1961–1990. The composite DWAAI tended to be higher (lower) in the strong (weak) WPSH years. Therefore, the activity of WPSH was an important factor affecting the frequency and intensity of DWAA."

 The Canary Archipelago, due to its location between the tropics and subtropics, represents a key region for studying precipitation moisture sources. This study provides a high-resolution (20 km) climatological analysis of the moisture sources for potential precipitation in the archipelago from 1985 to 2022, applying a dynamic downscaling methodology (WRF-ARW) and a Lagrangian approach considering the trajectories of potentially precipitating particles (FLEXPART-WRF model). The analysis differentiates between precipitation and non-precipitation days, western and eastern islands, and moisture transport above and below the trade wind inversion layer (at 900 hPa). Results indicate that the main moisture source for the archipelago is the North Atlantic (up to 74 % annually), and a crucial contribution comes from the northeast region of the islands, especially under prevailing trade wind conditions. During the summer, moisture from the African continent further enhances its contribution up to 16 % for the total moisture transported. The moisture pattern is more pronounced on days with precipitation, extending longitudinally towards the western Atlantic, and showing the largest positive anomalies during intense precipitation events. Notably, our findings highlight the strong contribution of moisture from the northeast above the inversion layer, even on non-precipitation days. Additionally, differences in precipitation moisture source patterns were observed between the eastern and western islands, with positive anomalies in the northern sector for the former and the western one for the latter, each associated with different circulation patterns."

 The Bay of Bengal storms (BoB storms) are the most catastrophic weather conditions in the region of Bay of Bengal and pose a significant threat to countries within and adjacent to the region, highlighting the urgent need for accurate forecasts to increase disaster prevention and mitigation efforts. However, sparse observations limit the accuracy of the BoB storm forecasts. Current numerical forecast systems adopt “target observation” strategy to increase additional observations and improve the forecast skill, but still face challenge of low efficiency and allow more model error effects on efficacy of additional observations. The study adopts a highly efficient Artificial Intelligence-driven “Pangu-Weather” model and constructs an optimization system for identifying sensitive areas of target observations associated with the BoB storm track forecasts based on the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) method. The CNOP method comprehensively accounts for nonlinear processes and has been verified to be superior to traditional linear approximation methods, such as singular vector, adjoint sensitivity, and ETKF. Based upon this system, the sensitive areas for target observations were determined for 12 forecasts of four strong BoB storms and their roles were evaluated in terms of the improvement of the storm track forecast level through observing system simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that preferentially improving the accuracy of the initial conditions in the sensitive areas, compared with doing it in randomly selected areas, can be more significant to upgrade the storm track forecast level; however, such upgrades only hold for the forecast duration of 24 h. This result provides hints for the potential of the Pangu-Weather model in forecasting BoB storms and has the implication that the predictability of the “Pangu-Weather” model with respect to the BoB storm tracks is dominantly constrained by model error effects after 24 h. It suggests that the improvement of model architecture is necessary for prolonging the predictability time of Pangu-Weather with respect to the BoB storms."

This study systematically analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of δ2Hp and δ18Op in 539 atmospheric precipitation samples collected from 6 stations of the North China along a longitudinal gradient of East Asia during 2020–2022. This analysis also investagted moisture transport pathways and precipitation source composition. The results show that: (1) Precipitation events of varying intensity exhibit significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity within the study area. The δ2Hp and δ18Op values of all precipitation events are enriched in summer and autumn (δ2Hp: −54.8 ± 32.3 ‰; δ18Op: −8.5 ± 4.5 ‰) and depleted in winter and spring (δ2Hp: −32.8 ± 36.9 ‰; δ18Op: −5.4 ± 4.83 ‰).

 The electric field and current intensity within the discharge channel are the key parameters for lightning research and protection. Aiming at the difficulty that the electric field in the channel cannot be directly measured, based on the dependence of spectral line broadening on the electric field, this paper developed a method for indirectly measuring the electric field within the lightning channel according to the experimental spectrum. Based on the lightning spectra and the synchronous ground electric field change waveforms caused by lightning, the basic parameters reflecting the current-carrying capacity of the channel, such as electron density, conductivity, and radius, were calculated, and the inner electric field at the bottom of the lightning discharge channel was further obtained. In the calculation, two methods are adopted for the spectral line broadening: direct measurement of the spectral line profile and inversion from the electron density calculated by the Stark broadening theory of spectral lines. The results show that the radial electric field near the lightning channel and the axial electric field inside the channel are respectively 2.31–22.78 × 104 kV/m and 1.30–13.14 kV/m. The internal electric field values calculated by the two methods are in good agreement. To further confirm the reliability of the calculation results, the axial current in the channel is calculated by using Ohm's law from the calculated internal electric field, and compared with the peak current estimated by the synchronous electric field change waveform. It is found that they have a good positive correlation. Moreover, the peak current and the axial current are positively correlated with the radius of the current-carrying core channel, respectively."

 To elucidate the impact of boundary-layer meteorology on persistent heavy haze pollution, we analyzed 2018–2019 observational data from a 255-m meteorological tower in Tianjin. The boundary-layer evolution demonstrated that during the pollution period, the nocturnal static stability significantly intensified, with a daily maximum averaging approximately 18 K/km, accompanied by a jet stream structure. During the dissipation period, the ventilation coefficient, mechanical turbulence, and turbulent kinetic energy values were 1.5–3 times those recorded during the pollution period. Regarding the turbulent motion states, the continuous accumulation of PM2.5 was accompanied by enhanced turbulent intermittency. Over 80 % of the turbulent motion was in an intermittent state at heavy pollution levels. During the pollution accumulation period, the turbulent intermittency was more intense in the lower atmosphere, implying a stronger turbulence barrier effect restraining the upward diffusion of surface pollutants. The substantial increase in static stability, which hindered downward momentum transmission, was an important cause for weakening mechanical turbulence and enhancing turbulent intermittency. The negative correlation between the boundary-layer height and PM2.5 concentrations did not apply universally. During the pollution accumulation phase, no significant correlation was observed between these two parameters, suggesting a possible more direct impact by other physical processes. Spectral analysis of a case study showed significantly correlated semi-diurnal periodic signals between surface pressure and PM2.5 concentrations during the pollution accumulation period. A 2 hPa pressure oscillation could cause a 40–50 μg/m3 variation in PM2.5, leading to bimodal peaks of PM2.5 concentrations at night and late morning."

 Knowledge about the dynamics of changes in PM10 lead concentration and the dependence of its levels on weather patterns is significant for health protection, especially in large cities. Also, it is important because of the need for effective environmental management. This study used the results of daily measurements conducted by the Polish State Environmental Monitoring and Weather Monitoring systems in 2010–2022. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique was most commonly used for the determination of PM10 Pb. Significant seasonal variability was observed (> 2 times higher values were determined in the heating period than in the non-heating period), while a downward trend in PM10 Pb concentration was demonstrated at the majority of the monitoring stations, which are mainly located in the southern part of Poland. In the heating period, the Pb concentration decreased on average by >4 times, while in the non-heating period it decreased by >2 times. The Pb concentration results are predominantly within two ranges: < 0.01 μg·m⁻3 and 0.01–0.1 μg·m⁻3. In the heating period, 32 % of results were in the <0.01 μg·m⁻3 range, and 66 % of results were in the 0.01–0.1 μg·m⁻3 range. In the non-heating period, it was the opposite: 65 % of results were in the <0.01 μg·m⁻3 range, and 34 % results were in the 0.01–0.1 μg·m⁻3 range. The annual norm, amounting to ≤0.5 μg·m⁻3 Pb in PM10, was not exceeded at any of the examined stations during the study years. A significant negative impact of meteorological parameters on Pb concentrations in PM10 was found in all the analyzed periods. Above average concentrations of Pb were accompanied by below average air temperatures and precipitation.

 Three years (2021 – 2023) of in-situ ground-based observations from a high-altitude site in Western Ghats, India, have been utilized to study the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation and closure during the monsoon (JJAS, June to September), including its transition periods (May and October). Aerosol-CCN characteristics showed an apparent temporal variation between monsoon and its transition periods. The estimated aerosol bulk hygroscopicity (κ) showed a narrow (broad) distribution during monsoon (transition periods). Aitken mode was dominant during JJAS, while Aitken-accumulation mode was dominant during the transition periods, suggesting that these modes primarily control the bulk hygroscopicity of the total aerosol population. These further indicate the increased wet scavenging of larger aerosol particles during JJAS compared to transition periods. The CCN closure study was performed using different κ values. The analysis showed a good closure in JJAS when κ = 0.15 was considered, while the transition periods showed a good closure at various κ and supersaturation (SS) values. This suggests that the CCN closure is less sensitive to the change in SS or κ during JJAS than the transition periods. Hence, the assumption of a single κ (e.g., κ = 0.15) or a narrow range of κ (= 0.15 – 0.20) can be considered during monsoon, while the same assumption cannot be applied during the transition periods for the study region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study using an extensive set of ground-based observations from the Indian region."

 A large spread exists in future precipitation projections based on climate models, particularly at regional scales, and efforts are needed to reduce uncertainties for effective regional adaptation strategies. Using outputs of 27 CMIP6 models, this study investigates uncertainties in mean and extreme precipitation projections over China. It is shown that uncertainties in the fractional change of mean precipitation are proportional to the magnitude of projected changes, being higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast, while extreme precipitation exhibits a more uniform spatial distribution. An analysis of uncertainty decomposition reveals that internal variability dominates short-term projection uncertainty, particularly for extreme precipitation. By the end of the 21st century, model uncertainty emerges as the largest contributor to mean precipitation uncertainty and accounts for more than one-third of extreme precipitation uncertainty. Optimal model selection method can reduce model uncertainty up to about 40 %, and it is more effective for mean precipitation than for extreme precipitation. Besides, the effectiveness of the method varies largely with the evaluation metrics and regions considered, emphasizing the need for metric-specific and region-specific model evaluations. These findings highlight the importance of tailored strategies to improve the reliability of future regional precipitation projections."

 Flash floods in the Western Mediterranean pose a growing hazard due to the effects of climate change, rapid urbanization, and land-use changes. This study focuses on flash floods in the Montsià region of southern Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula), with particular emphasis on the municipality of Alcanar, because it illustrates the recent intensification of flash flood dynamics in the Western Mediterranean. The research is motivated by three recent severe flood events in Alcanar (2018, 2021, and 2023), each characterized by extraordinary rainfall totals and significant economic losses, unprecedented in the municipality's 30-year observational record. Methodologically, we integrate multiple data sources—including meteorological station observations, weather radar products, lightning detection networks, high-resolution mesoscale model outputs, and a flood database spanning 1980–2023, complemented by economic compensation records from 1996 to 2020. Through this approach we (i) assess the regional frequency of heavy rainfall and flood episodes, (ii) quantify the economic impacts in Alcanar, (iii) characterize the meteorological and thermodynamic conditions on the three most intense recent events (including moisture source tracking via a Lagrangian methodology), and (iv) analyze spatio-temporal trends in extreme rainfall indicators (percentiles, threshold exceedances, kurtosis, and skewness). Our findings suggest that, from a meteorological perspective, current flash flood behavior in the Western Mediterranean likely emerges from the interplay of localized orographic triggers, elevated sea surface temperatures, strong instability associated with low-level moisture, particular positioning of jet streaks, synoptic-scale cut-off lows, and remote moisture sources. The results also point to an increase in rainfall intensity, explained by the presence of high precipitable water content and shallow convection, which enhances precipitation efficiency. These insights highlight the critical need for robust flood early warning systems, strategic watershed management, and improved risk communication to mitigate escalating flash flood risks in the Montsià county and similar areas throughout the Western Mediterranean region."

 The 2022 mega flash drought over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), which occurred without sufficient early warning, substantially affected water supply and hydropower generation. This raises a concern about exploring the precursors of flash droughts to facilitate prediction at subseasonal time scale. Previous studies have indicated that flash droughts are directly affected by insufficient precipitation and corresponding circulation anomalies. However, how intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) provide possible precursors and affect the drought onset remains unclear. Based on the analysis of flash droughts over the YRB during 1961–2022, we find that 38.9 % and 16.7 % of them are influenced by 10–20-day and 20–60-day mid-latitude ISOs, respectively. Although 10–20-day ISOs trigger more flash droughts, 20–60-day ISOs are more favorable for accelerating the onset speed of flash droughts. Specifically, the 10–20-day ISOs trigger eastward Rossby waves, promoting the eastward shift of the South Asian High and enhancing subsidence over the YRB, thereby contributing to flash drought onset. The 20–60-day ISOs are associated with the stagnation of a Circumglobal Teleconnection, and facilitating the superposition of the South Asian High and the Western Pacific Subtropical High, accelerating flash droughts onset. Although the impact of different timescales of ISOs on flash droughts varies, their combined effects are a critical factor in triggering mega flash droughts over the YRB. Our study suggests transitions from wet phases to dry phases of ISOs are critical precursors for flash drought early warning."

The new system for comparing hourly IMERG V07 and V06 products at one gauge and ranking all gauge stations in the gauge group is called the increment-ranking scoring index (ISI). The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Compared to IMERG V06, IMERG V07 demonstrates better typhoon precipitation detection capability and higher stability. Although the V07 has improved the problem of underestimating hourly rainfall events, the increasing number of precipitation overestimations across all gauges still raises concerns. (2) The gauge groups with high ISI values demonstrate satisfactory performance in satellite-derived precipitation estimates, while those characterized by high ΔKGE (delta Kling-Gupta Efficiency) values perform less satisfactorily. Higher ISI values (more significant enhancements by V07) are more commonly observed in the coastal region than in the inland region. By introducing the ISI for comprehensive performance evaluation of IMERG V07 and V06 during Typhoon In-Fa, a performance-enhancement-oriented evaluation system proposed in this study is intuitive and concise in revealing the advances of IMERG V07 when monitoring and reconstructing typhoon processes."

 A significant increase in summer precipitation was observed in Northwest China (NWC) from 1961 to 2014, posing opportunities and challenges for the local ecosystem and human society. Using multi-model pre-industrial control simulations, and historical and single-forcing simulations from the state-of-the-art MIROC6 model, we attributed this wetting trend and explored the relative roles of individual external forcings. Our finding indicated that external forcing is the primary driver of this observed wetting, with anthropogenic forcing—dominated by greenhouse gases (GHG) and secondarily by anthropogenic aerosols (AA)—playing a significant role than natural forcing. Moisture budget analysis indicated that intensified moisture flux convergence, driven by circulation changes, is a key mechanism behind the NWC wetting in both GHG and AA simulations. Specifically, GHG forcing alters the Asian subtropical westerly jet (ASWJ), inducing a southward shift of the western branch and a weakening of the eastern branch. These changes correspond to an anomalous cyclone (anticyclone) in the west (east) of NWC, promoting moisture convergence over NWC of anomalous southwesterly and southeasterly winds. AA forcing weakens the ASWJ, producing a meridional dipole pattern of an anomalous anticyclone (cyclone) in the north (south), along with lower-level anomalous anticyclone over Mongolia and Northeast China. This circulation pattern facilitates moisture transport from the western North Pacific into inland NWC via anomalous easterlies and intensified moisture flux convergence."

 In this study, using the data from laser disdrometer, S-band dual-polarization radars and conventional observations, the microphysical parameters and characteristics of precipitation particles during an elevated thunderstorm event in Henan Province, China occurred on February 24, 2021 were analyzed. The results indicate that: (1) The synoptic pattern during this precipitation process followed a typical cold-season elevated thunderstorm structure, extending from upper layers to the surface. Strong echo height exceeding the −20 °C layer was the main reason for the formation of ice-phase particles and lightning. (2) Precipitation particles displayed different size-distribution models and disparate phases during the diverse precipitation stages. During the initial stage, the particle size distribution displayed a single-peak pattern, primarily composed of drizzle and ice pellets. In the development stage, the size distribution showed both single-peak and multi-peak patterns, with particles including freezing rain, graupel, and small ice crystals. During the subsequent stable snowfall stage, the precipitation was mainly consisted of various morphological ice crystals, graupel, and wet snow particles dominated by small solid particles with a diameter less than 1 mm, the peak number concentration was 0.69 mm in diameter, and their terminal velocities were stable at 1 m s−1. (3) During the snowfall, enhanced Zdr and Kdp characteristics are observed in the upper cloud layers, with the height of Kdp maximum located below that of Zdr peak, indicating a distinct seeder-feeder mechanism in the precipitation. In the atmospheric layer of tempereature from −20 °C to −10 °C, the Bergeron process facilitated rapid ice crystal growth through vapor deposition, leading to the formation of ice-crystal aggregates and promoting sleet formation. (4) The primary mechanism of snowflake formation was the deposition and aggregation processes, and the riming and coalescence processes played a significant role in the descent of the particles. The formation of large snowflakes was attributed to the collision and aggregation of smaller snowflakes, as well as riming growth.

Utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data, this study investigates stratosphere-troposphere coupling mechanisms through dynamic and thermodynamic analyses with a focus on tropopause folds dynamics that drove this extreme event. The results demonstrate that the 26 December 2020 Arctic sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event triggered a zonal wind reversal in early January and downward-propagating geopotential height and temperature anomalies that displaced the polar vortex toward Eastern China, inducing southward high-potential vorticity (PV) air mass intrusion via tropopause folds. Diagnostic analysis using the 3D labeling methods revealed a significant rise in tropopause folds frequency preceding the cold wave, culminating in deep folding events as high-PV air masses penetrated the midlatitude troposphere down to 700 hPa while the sloping 315 K isentropic surface facilitated southward cold stratospheric air transport and enhanced convective development through fold intensification. Thermodynamic analysis revealed marked instability within and beneath the dry intrusion zone characterized by negative Brunt-Väisälä frequency squared (N2) and Richardson numbers <0.25, where stratified instability and turbulence generation correlated positively with fold intensity, and the coupling of tropopause folds intrusions with mid-high latitude cyclonic ascent and low-latitude anticyclonic descent amplified vertical convection-driven cold surge intensification. This study establishes tropopause folds as a critical mediator bridging stratospheric anomalies with surface extreme events, highlighting its regulatory function in cold outbreak dynamics through coordinated stratosphere-troposphere mass exchange and vertically destabilizing processes."

 Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) estimation faces constraint due to complicate parameterization. The non-parametric (NP) method offers an efficient alternative, but its effectiveness across diverse environments, particularly under extreme conditions, is uncertain. This study leverages data from 131 global flux stations across various climate and landcover types to assess the NP method's accuracy, focusing on extreme scenarios spanning from dry to wet and from hot to cold. Our results indicate substantial variability, with absolute errors ranging from −41.7 to 26.8 W/m2 and relative errors between 0.4 % and 98.1 %. The NP method tends to overestimate ET in hot, dry conditions, and underestimate in cold, wet conditions, with performance declining under extremes. Cold climates exhibit the largest biases, with particularly severe underestimation in extreme wet (−54.5 W/m2) and cold (−69.2 W/m2) conditions. Closed shrublands demonstrate the largest overestimation (73.2 W/m2) in extreme hot conditions. Across stations, three error patterns are observed: (i) overestimation in dry-hot regions caused by a high difference between equilibrium and actual ET, (ii) underestimation in humid regions resulting from a low difference, and (iii) underestimation in cold regions arising from large surface-air temperature gradients, causing an excessive integral term resulting in overcorrection. These errors could be amplified under extreme conditions, reducing model performance and highlighting the NP method's sensitivity to hydroclimatic extremes while offering insights for improving its accuracy and robustness."

 The East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) shape China's summer climate. The transition from July to August marks a critical shift between the Meiyu season and the North/Northeast China rainy season, yet the underlying drivers of the inter-monthly evolution in precipitation during this period remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the northern Indian Ocean (NIO)-South China Sea (NIO-SCS) and the inter-monthly precipitation evolution in eastern China during July–August. A significant interdecadal shift in the relationship between the NIO-SCS SSTAs and eastern China's precipitation around 1995/96. Before 1995, warm NIO-SCS SSTAs consistently enhanced precipitation in the Huaihe-Yangtze River Basin (HYRB) throughout July and August, primarily altered by the Pacific-Japan (PJ) teleconnection pattern. However, after 1996, a distinct pattern emerged: warm NIO-SCS SSTAs increased precipitation over the HYRB and simultaneously reduced precipitation in North/Northeast China in July. In contrast, this pattern is reversed in August. Based on observations and numerical experiments, the interdecadal shift is linked to a weakening of Indian Ocean SSTAs after 1996 compared to before. During the post-1996, cooler Indian Ocean SSTAs in July weaken the Kelvin wave, shifting the PJ pattern westward and broadly influencing precipitation across eastern China. In August, the cooler Indian Ocean SSTAs induce westward-shifted Walker circulation anomalies, with a descending branch near the Philippine Sea extending to 30°N, leading to decreased precipitation in the HYRB and increased precipitation over North/Northeast China. Furthermore, the reduction in NIO-SCS SSTAs' amplitude after 1996 may be attributed to a weakened spring ENSO amplitude, potentially linked to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation."

 In the extra-tropics, moisture is efficiently transported polewards in the lower troposphere through narrow bands of moisture transport, known as Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). This study identifies ARs that penetrate the southern Himalaya using 6-hourly Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT), and investigates the moisture dynamics, thermodynamics, and moisture sources of the top 8 AR events with substantial precipitation impacts in the Indus Basin (IB) and Ganga Basin (GB), to understand the mechanisms driving extreme AR-related precipitation. Most of these ARs produce over 150 mm/day precipitation (exceeding the 99th percentile of non-zero daily-precipitation) along their central axis and mountain landfall locations, and up to 50 mm/day in the plains. Even the glacierized regions that feed the main basins’ streams receive over 65 mm/day. High-intensity precipitation typically found near southern Himalaya, strongly corresponds to positive moisture convergence and positive advection, with minimal changes in atmospheric moisture content indicating effective translation of AR-moisture to precipitation. Different regions within the ARs experience distinct precipitation mechanisms, with mountains/foothills dominated by orographic uplift even under weak convective conditions, while areas near/on AR-axis are influenced by convective or frontal lifting. The presence of high moisture (IVT), saturated layers, and favourable thermodynamics highlights the ARs' capacity to generate intense precipitation when vertical lift is present. Excess moisture within ARs primarily originates from the Arabian Sea (north, east, and west), followed by Bay of Bengal (north and east), land-based evaporation, and smaller contribution from the Middle Eastern Seas. These case-specific findings demonstrate that ARs are key moisture transport mechanisms to mainland India and the Himalaya, delivering extreme localized precipitation strongly influenced by topography and position of ARs axis. This study offers the first comprehensive understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic sources of AR moisture, associated precipitation, and the role of the Himalaya in extracting large amounts of moisture from ARs. These findings have important implications for understanding ARs contribution to extreme precipitation in IB and GB, driving mechanisms behind AR-precipitation, and the sources of high moisture content during ARs. These results can help explore potential risks of extreme precipitation, improve AR modeling, and forecasting ARs over these regions."

 East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), a system comprised of several atmospheric members, profoundly impacts local and global climate. However, whether the EAWM is always a firmly unified system is unclear. This study examines the connection between two key EAWM system members: the East Asian trough (EAT) and Siberian High (SH). Our findings reveal that the connection between the two circulations is most unstable in January out of the three winter months over the past six decades. Notably, the January EAT-SH connection has experienced a significant decadal weakening since the early 1990s. By diagnosing the related baroclinic and barotropic processes, we demonstrate that although baroclinic process is important in establishing the EAT-SH connection, its contribution is weaker than that of barotropic process. When the EAT and SH are associated with different barotropic processes, their connection is undermined. Over the whole period, the barotropic processes related to the EAT and SH are featured by a triple atmospheric pattern over the North Atlantic-Eastern Europe. This pattern maintains a stable and significant relationship with the SH, but its association with the EAT is substantially weakened since the early 1990s. Further analysis suggests that this decadal weakened relationship possibly attributed to the decadal weakened westerly jet stream over the Eurasian continent. Alongside this weakened jet stream, the Rossby wave train triggered by the triple atmospheric pattern more readily propagates upward into the stratosphere, but exhibits weak horizontal propagation over Siberia. Consequently, the impact of the triple atmospheric pattern on the EAT diminishes after the early 1990s, contributing to the weakened EAT-SH connection."

 Changes in rainfall seasonality can have far-reaching impacts on the livelihood of population, agricultural production, and ecosystem sustainability. However, the changes in rainfall seasonality and associated climatic causes are largely unclear, especially in global land monsoon regions. Here, we analyzed the variations of rainfall seasonality during 1960–2022, and explored the possible effects of global climate teleconnections (CTs) on rainfall seasonality changes in global land monsoon regions using interpretable machine learning and multivariate wavelet coherency method. The results show that rainfall seasonality weakens significantly in northeastern South Asian, northeastern South American, and most parts of southern North African and South African monsoon regions, but enhances significantly in southern South Asian, northern North African, and southwestern South American monsoon regions. Rainfall seasonality also experiences an abrupt change in all hotspots during 1960–2022. We also find that many CTs are nonmonotonically related to rainfall seasonality in these hotspots, and the key CTs that explain the variations in rainfall seasonality differ across different hotspots using interpretable machine learning. The coupled influences of the key CTs on rainfall seasonality are also significant at certain scales during different periods in these hotspots.

 The impact of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme on the simulated track of TC InFa (2021) is explored in this study. The TC track and intensity are accurately captured in the experiment with the eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) PBL scheme. Conversely, the TC exhibits a noticeably slower translation speed and deviates significantly from the observed track in the experiment using the Yonsei University (YSU) PBL scheme. The potential vorticity tendency (PVT) budget analysis reveals that the diabatic heating related to the asymmetric convection within the TC inner-core has a negative impact on the translation speed of TC. The in-cloud mixing effect in the YSU scheme is conducive to transporting the moisture from the boundary layer to the upper levels, promoting the development of asymmetric deep convection and the enhancing diabatic heating. This study presents a new perspective, suggesting that the representation of in-cloud mixing in the PBL scheme plays an important role on affecting the TC movement."

 Extreme precipitation events in the winter season (WEPEs) over Southeast China cause tremendous social and economic loss with spatiotemporal variability across scales, making it important to study the complicated triggering mechanisms and further to improve seamless forecasting skills for winter extreme precipitation events (WEPEs). Based on a daily precipitation dataset from 2474 stations across China from 1961 to 2023, an objective identification metric was employed to identify 347 WEPEs over Southeast China. Synthesis analysis was performed by using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data to study the circulation features across large-scale, synoptic scale, and sub-synoptic scale. Results show that WEPEs occur more frequently in the central region rather than the northern and southern coastal areas. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function and objective pattern correlation statistics, 279 WEPEs were classified into five categories, i.e. Huai River Basin type (HR), Yangtze River Middle-Lower Reaches type (YR), Central Southeast China type (CSE), Southeast China type (SE), and South China type (SC). Similarities among the five types are concluded from two perspectives. On one hand, large-scale and synoptic scale characteristics all present anomalous troughs in the lower troposphere over South China extending to the Indochinese Peninsula, which deepened the southern branch trough (SBT), and anomalous positive geopotential height anomalies near northeast China and Japan in the form of the Northeast Asian anomalous anticyclone (NAAA). On the other hand, the unbalanced winds in the lower atmosphere coincide with precipitation areas and intensity of the five types of WEPEs. Differences are evident in locations and intensities of both scale systems resulting to different moisture transports. Moisture transport from the NAAA in HR and YR types is greater than from the SBT. Moisture in the CSE type mainly comes from the SBT, while it originates from the combined effects of the SBT and the NAAA in the SE and SC types. What's more, the unbalanced winds of sub-synoptic scales more accurately highlight similarities and differences in moisture transport channels over heavy precipitating areas compared to ageostrophic wind."

 This study investigates the processes driving interannual variability of rainfall over the western coast of the Philippines during the peak southwest monsoon (SWM) months (July–September) from 1961 to 2022. Specifically, it describes how tropical cyclones (TC), SWM, and TC-enhanced SWM influence SWM rainfall variability. Rainfall measurements from 11 stations along the western coast of the Philippines were classified into three types: direct TC rainfall (PD), indirect TC rainfall (PI), and SWM rainfall (PSM). The yearly contributions of PD, PI, and PSM to SWM rainfall were estimated to be 15.4 %, 33.1 %, and 51.5 %, respectively. Furthermore, four rainfall variability types were found depending on the characteristics of each year's rainfall anomalies: enhanced PD but suppressed PSM (D+S-), suppressed PD but enhanced PSM (D-S+), enhanced PI but suppressed PSM (I+S-), and suppressed PI but enhanced PSM (I-S+). Composite analysis using ERA5 data revealed the presence of anomalous winds and circulations unique to each type that causes variations in the TC tracks and the monsoon flow, which accounts for the rainfall variability. Notable ones are the anomalous anticyclone over Taiwan in the D+S- case, which pushes TCs closer to the Philippines, and the anomalous anticyclone east of the Philippines in the I+S- case, which enhances the trade winds."

 This study applies the Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) algorithm to investigate the causal relationship between Arctic Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) and the Siberian High (SH) from a causal perspective. The main results are as follows: 1) Both autumn and winter pan-Arctic SIC have a causal influence on the winter SH, and the causal influence of autumn SIC on SH being significantly stronger than that of winter SIC. 2) The causal strength of autumn SIC on the SH differs by region, being most potent in the Barents-Kara Sea and least in the Greenland Sea. Nonetheless, the trends in interannual variations in causal strength are uniform, with a notable intensification in the impact of autumn SIC on SH across various regions after 1998. 3) A comparison of the circulation patterns before and after 1998 reveals that the reduction in the autumn Arctic SIC may affect the SH through stratospheric pathways. Specifically, after 1998, the accelerated reduction in the autumn Arctic SIC has weakened the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and the westerly jet, enhanced cold air activities, which in turn strengthened the SH. This study will enhance the comprehension of the impact of Arctic sea ice decline on the SH and its potential as an early warning signal. Additionally, it will improve the understanding of the causal relationships between Arctic sea ice and mid-latitude climate, which can help in forecasting extreme cold events."

 This study contributes to a better understanding of past climate variability and mesoscale dynamics in the Mediterranean Basin, a region with notable sensitivity to climate change.We investigate the variations of rainfall amount and intensity by analyzing centenary time series in Italy. The study area offers an ideal setting for analyzing these dynamics due to its unique geographical position. The rainfall time series are compared to the climate indices time series to understand the influences of the mesoscale atmospheric teleconnections and of the possible changes in rainfall regimes due to an increase of the sea surface temperatures. The study is conducted by applying statistical methods on more than 100 time series. The results show that most regions of Italy have been affected by a decrease in rainfall amount and an increase in rainfall intensity over the last 200 years. This work also highlights that these patterns are correlated to positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation and to an increase in sea surface temperatures. The trends of climate indices thus suggest a decrease in the amount and an increase in the intensity of future rainfall distribution, with severe consequences in terms of water availability and geo-related risks."

 Polar amplification can exert a profound influence on global climate and extreme weather events in distant regions via teleconnections and atmospheric variability. Although previous have revealed linkages and interactions among temperature anomalies of Earth's three poles, what degree propagations of polar amplification can influence other regions is not fully understood. To fulfill this knowledge gap, we adopted a climate network-based approach to quantify the intensity and pathways of propagation, and identify sensitive regions using the Polar Amplification Index (PAI) originated from three different scenarios of the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Our results indicated that the polar amplification and propagation patterns for the Earth's three poles show distinct regional and seasonal differences under different warming levels. With the warming increasing, the stronger strength of propagations tends to be concentrated on the land, and distribution patterns become more stable. Meanwhile, the length of the propagation pathway for polar amplification would be shorter with faster time and stronger strength. Furthermore, we pointed out several polar amplification-sensitive regions, including the around 30°N and 30°S, Barents Sea region near the Arctic Circle. Based on these findings, polar amplification will accelerate much more and induce drastic influences via propagation in the dynamics of global climate patterns unless warming levels are minimized. Our study highlights the significance of enhancing our understanding of projected changes in the polar regions and offers valuable insights to inform strategies for coping with climate change and extreme events."

 The seasonal cycle of precipitation in South America (SA) peaks in intensity during austral summer (DJF), contributing up to 80% of the total annual rainfall. This seasonality is influenced by variability at different time-scales. At the subseasonal range, there is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms controlling high-frequency transients (8–20 days) of precipitation, which accounts for ∼60% of the total DJF subseasonal variance. Our results show that the observed high-frequency variability features a dipole pattern in SA, whose phase is controlled by the complex interplay between upper-tropospheric Rossby waves, remotely triggered by variability in the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) convective activity, and regional low-tropospheric moisture transport and topography. The nature of the remotely-generated signal is further identified in sensitivity experiments with a Linear Baroclinic Model. Our results indicate that this teleconnection pattern can be used as a potential tool for subseasonal precipitation predictability, and that addressing model biases in simulating the spatio-temporal characteristics of SPCZ precipitation is important for near-hemispheric climate projections."

 This study investigates the effects of sea surface temperature (SST) updating strategy in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model during a heatwave event over the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea in July 2019. The MM5 revised Surface Layer and Yonsei University Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) schemes were used and wind field at 10 m, air potential temperature, surface fluxes, and planetary boundary layer height were examined. Generally, the greatest impacts over the sea were observed within 20 km of the shoreline. We found an underestimation of the modeled SST in non-updated SST simulations during the heatwave episode that was propagated into the atmosphere, leading to a cold bias of 2-m potential temperature up to 2.5 K onshore. In heatwave conditions the most common surface layer stability class was very unstable, and its frequency increased when the SST was updated, particularly near the coast, revealing that SST updating leads to greater dominance of thermal turbulent mixing of surface fluxes in the heatwave period studied. Sensible and latent heat fluxes across stability regimes were analyzed, and latent heat flux showed greater sensitivity to SST updating and the highest magnitudes. However, PBL height variations between SST-updated and non-updated simulations presented a greater sensitivity to sensible heat flux. On average, during the heatwave period, the planetary boundary layer height in simulations with updated SST increased by 75 m onshore, compared to a smaller increase of 26 m offshore, which highlights the greater sensitivity in the onshore region and their impact on vertical modeled profiles. These results emphasize the importance of an accurate representation of boundary layer conditions on numerical weather prediction models, as well as illustrating the nonlinear behavior on the surface layer and PBL scheme, particularly important under heatwaves."
