C. Chakraborty;Fan Mei;Yang Wang,Employing Machine Learning for New Particle Formation Identification and Mechanistic Analysis: Insights From a Six‐Year Observational Study in the Southern Great Plains,"We present a supervised machine learning (ML) framework to automatically identify new particle formation (NPF) events and analyze key atmospheric factors associated with their occurrence and growth. We applied ML to detect NPF events using start time and particle concentrations across size ranges, while identifying atmospheric variables including ambient temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation intensity (SRI), wind speed, wind direction, boundary layer height, total organics, sulfate, nitrate, total surface area concentration, sulfur dioxide, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). We analyzed a 6‐year data set from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in Oklahoma, USA. Using long‐term ground‐based measurements, we identified NPF events and applied Random Forest Classifiers, which achieved 90%–95% prediction accuracy. Feature importance analysis highlighted SRI, relative humidity, and ambient temperature as the most influential variables, contributing normalized importances of 28%, 17%, and 10%. Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) indicated that higher SRI and lower relative humidity were critical in promoting NPF formation at SGP. Seasonally, NPF events were more frequent in winter (42.1%) and spring (35.5%), and least in summer (4.0%). Particle growth rates also exhibited a seasonal variation, with the lowest in winter (below 2 nm hr−1) and highest in late spring and early summer (exceeding 5 nm hr−1). Temperature, turbulent kinetic energy, and aerosol properties were the primary factors of growth rate variability. This study advances predictive modeling of NPF, offers insights for future campaign deployments, and demonstrates the effectiveness of ML in understanding the formation and growth of atmospheric aerosols."

Lee;Paul A. Makar;Joana Soares,Clustering Analysis of Very Large Measurement and Model Data Sets on High‐Performance Computing Platforms,"Hierarchical agglomerative clustering is a useful analysis technique which allows for a level of stability, interpretability and flexibility not available in other similar techniques such as K‐means, density‐based clustering or positive matrix factorization. Previous studies using hierarchical clustering on atmospheric model output have been limited to small domain sizes (roughly 100 × 100 grid cells) by the computational expense and memory requirements of the algorithm. Here we present a scalable hierarchical clustering implementation that we apply to two year‐long, hourly atmospheric data sets: model concentration and deposition timeseries at 290,520 locations over Alberta and Saskatchewan (538 × ${\times} $ 540 grid); and 366,427 multi‐pollutant observations from 51 national air pollution surveillance stations located across Canada. When combined with other information such as emissions source locations, orography, and prevailing meteorological conditions, the method yields coherent, interpretable structures. In the case of model time series, the clustering provides regions of similar air quality (airsheds) which can be used to inform air quality monitoring network placement, or regions of similar deposition which can inform critical load assessment as well as monitoring site locations. In the case of the multi‐pollutant observations, we show that a single low‐primary pollutant cluster appears the most frequently at all but one of 51 stations across Canada, accounting for 62% of all station‐hours, while elevated SO2 appears in factor profiles at certain monitoring locations near industrial and shipping activity. Together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical clustering can efficiently summarize patterns relevant to airshed mapping and source apportionment at previously unreachable scales."

A. Solomon;Arman Aghahosseini;Christian Breyer,Uneven Distribution of Natural Energy Resources Impacts on Systemwide Energy Return on Investment,"Regional disparities in natural energy resources may impede the acceleration of energy transitions in regional power systems, as the shift to net‐zero power systems requires significant energy inputs. Net energy, defined as the surplus remaining after accounting for energy inputs, serves as a key metric of system performance. This study examines the net energy performance of nine regions across the nine decarbonization scenarios to 2050 using the systemwide energy return on investment (EROI) framework. This framework adopts a holistic approach to assess primary energy quality at the electricity level, using the cumulative energy demand indicator derived from life cycle assessment analysis, and integrating EROI calculations with outputs from the LUT Energy System Transition Model. None of the regional EROIs fall below 10, often regarded as a global threshold for viability, although accounting for social factors and regional variations, the minimum EROI necessary to sustain societal functions may differ substantially. Thus, the regional energy transition (ET) is techno‐economically feasible without incurring a resource curse arising from further energy needs. Low‐cost renewable energy (RE) technologies dominate the energy mix, while other extractable regional natural energy resources have a minimal impact on EROI trends. In highly variable RE penetrations mainly driven by solar photovoltaics and wind power, the greater requirement for enabling technologies entails a decline in regional EROIs. In essence, achieving a net‐zero and cost‐effective ET requires prioritizing low‐cost RE technologies, indirectly mitigating the risk of a renewable resource curse and furnishing policymakers with a compelling rationale for their strategic importance."

S. van Bemmel,High‐Resolution Modeling of Future Urban Area and Population Exposure to Floods and Landslides,"Future population growth is expected to concentrate in urban agglomerations that overlap with various natural hazard zones. However, quantifying the resulting risks remains challenging, as hazard areas tend to be bounded locally while population forecasts are produced at much coarser scales. Addressing this gap, the high‐resolution 2UP model disaggregates national‐level, scenario‐based population projections to a 30 arc‐seconds grid, simultaneously simulating urban expansion and the distribution of urban and rural populations through 2100. By overlaying these projections with comparably detailed fluvial flood and landslide hazard data, this study demonstrates that, at a global scale, rapid urbanization will disproportionately increase population growth in hazard‐prone zones compared to safer areas. This trend is particularly pronounced in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia, where both the extent of exposed urban land and the magnitude of exposed populations are projected to rise sharply. In contrast, slower growth in North America and Europe leads to more moderate increases in hazard exposure, with smaller differences between hazardous and non‐hazardous sites. Notably, while urban areas in many countries continue expanding into high‐risk regions, the fraction of the total population exposed to these hazards may stabilize or even decline after 2050. The 2UP model's fine‐grained outputs are especially valuable in regions with fragmented urban landscapes, large rural populations, and rapid demographic shifts, providing decision‐makers and researchers with critical insights for integrated risk management and sustainable development planning."

 Tidal flat topography is a fundamental attribute affecting inundation dynamics, sediment transport, and ecosystem functioning, yet accurate and spatially consistent large-scale monitoring remains challenging. Here, we leveraged satellite altimetry from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission to develop a novel, large-scale framework for deriving tidal flat topography from SWOT data, and demonstrated its capability by generating a high-accuracy, national-scale elevation dataset for China. By combining a percentile-based aggregation of multi-temporal water-surface elevation observations with a tide-constrained, adaptive best-quantile (best-q) reconstruction strategy, followed by linear interpolation for gap filling, we improved both vertical accuracy and spatial completeness. Validation against airborne LiDAR, GNSS-RTK surveys, and ICESat-2 photon data demonstrates robust performance across diverse coastal settings, achieving RMSE = 0.34–0.47 m and R2 = 0.81–0.88 at a horizontal resolution of 100 m. Compared with existing large-scale digital elevation models (DEMs), the SWOT-derived topography not only improves vertical accuracy by over 80% but also providing substantially more complete spatial coverage of tidal flat elevations. Spatial analyses reveal pronounced latitudinal gradients, with higher tidal flats concentrated in low-latitude regions and extensive low-lying flats dominating northern estuarine and deltaic systems. This study establishes a scalable framework for tidal-flat elevation retrieval and provides a foundational dataset to support coastal monitoring and sustainable management."

 To enhance ecosystem functioning and terrestrial carbon sink capacity, the Chinese government has implemented a series of regional ecological projects. However, the effectiveness of ecological projects varies considerably due to regional climate differences and diverse implementation strategies. This study analyzed long-term time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) from 1982 to 2018 across eight Forestry Ecological Engineering Projects (FEEPs) and is the first to combine Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) with a modified residual trend analysis to quantify the contributions of these projects to vegetation greenness and productivity. The results indicate that both NDVI and GPP exhibited overall increasing trends in FEEP regions, although GPP exhibited lower magnitude and stability (with a monotonically increasing of about 35 % of pixels) than NDVI (with a monotonically increasing of about 54 % of pixels). GPP was more sensitive to environmental changes, with the proportions of pixels significantly correlated with temperature, precipitation, and sunlight being 74.0 %, 59.0 %, and 55.3 %, respectively, higher than the corresponding values for NDVI (68.6 %, 54.8 %, and 49.2 %). NDVI trend turning points were closely related to the timing of FEEP implementation, whereas GPP turning points showed weaker correlations. Our analysis indicates that FEEPs are the primary driver of NDVI increases, effectively mitigating the negative impacts of climate change on vegetation greenness, while GPP is mainly controlled by climate, with engineering measures insufficient to offset the long-term negative effects of extreme climate events. This study highlights the complex responses of vegetation to environmental changes and the potential vulnerability of ecosystem carbon sequestration under climate change."

 Nitrogenous organic compounds are increasingly garnering attention in the atmospheric environment and climate research due to their significant influence on the formation of secondary organic aerosol. New particle formation (NPF) is an essential source of aerosol formation. Ambient observations and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that Glycine (Gly), one of the most important organic nitrogen compounds, can enhance sulfuric acid (SA)-dominated NPF in metropolis environments. With the global reduction in SA levels due to stricter SO2 emission controls, nucleation driven by methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and methylamine (MA) has gained significant attention. However, the underlying mechanisms and the impact of Gly on MSA-MA clusters formation under varying atmospheric conditions remain poorly ambiguous. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with the Atmospheric Clusters Dynamic Code (ACDC) simulations, were employed to investigate the formation of (MSA)x·(MA)y·(Gly)z (y ≤ x + z ≤ 3) clusters. The findings revealed that Gly can significantly boost the formation rates of MSA-MA nucleation by up to 6 orders of magnitude, particularly in polluted atmospheric boundary layers with MSA concentrations approximating 108 molecules·cm−3. Simultaneously, in regions with low temperatures, high [Gly] (109 molecules·cm−3), [MA] (2.5 × 109 molecules·cm−3) and low [MSA] (106 molecules·cm−3), Gly-inclusive clusters contribute up to 18 %. Notably, the NPF mechanism indicates that Gly enhances the development of initial clusters via a catalytic effect and is directly involved in the growth of pivotal clusters. This finding is corroborated by the traced cluster formation pathways observed in highly polluted megacities with winter. This research endeavors to offer a deeper comprehension of previously unidentified sources of NPF in the pollution areas and aid in constructing a more detailed multi-species nucleation model tailored for such regions."

 Near-surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) plays a critical role in the formation of acid rain, photochemical smog, and aerosol particles, posing serious risks to public health. Polar-orbiting satellites are conventionally used for large-scale monitoring of NO2. However, satellite-based NO2 retrieval techniques predominantly rely on gas absorption within the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions, and thus are unable to capture nighttime NO2 concentrations. Moreover, deriving NO2 values in regions blurred by cloud cover or data missing remains a significant unresolved challenge, further complicating efforts to achieve spatially and temporally consistent atmospheric analyses. This study utilizes the thermal infrared absorption band of NO2 from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard Himawari-8, alongside various auxiliary datasets, to estimate both diurnal and nocturnal near-surface NO2 concentrations across central and eastern China. To address data missing caused by cloud coverage, a NO2 inpainting algorithm based on satellite-ground data fusion is proposed. Three kinds of 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate strong agreement between derived NO2 estimates and in-situ measurements, achieving R2 up to 0.85. The retrieval data reveal significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in ground NO2 levels across China. Urban centers, particularly large metropolitan areas, display a distinct ""urban island effect"". Diurnal patterns show two distinct peaks around 09:00 and 20:00 local time. Seasonal fluctuations are also evident, with summer recording the lowest NO2 concentration and winter showing the highest. This study offers new insights into hourly dissolved 24-h cycle surface NO2 dynamics, potentially advancing real-time pollution monitoring and public health protection."

 The processes on Tropical cyclones' (TCs) looping tracks (LTs) near an isolated terrain are investigated with numerical simulations. The large-scale environmental fields of observed TCs approaching Taiwan Island with and without LTs are compared. LT cases exhibit a monsoon gyre (MG)-like circulation on the southeast side of the TC, in contrast to the non-looping cases. This circulation serves as a key background difference of the two types of TC motions. Idealized simulations show that when a TC approaches the island's topography from the east, the channeling effect enhances the northerly flow, accelerating the TC southward. Meanwhile, the MG is blocked by the topography, preventing it from merging with the TC as it does in the absence of topography, contributing to a separation between their centers. As a result, the westerly flow from the southern flank of MG can subsequently steer the TC. Thereafter, the merger of MG and TC circulation completes the LT. In contrast, a TC in the absence of either an MG or topography only exhibits a southward or northward deflection, without undergoing a LT. This study highlights the interactions among the TC, MG and topography may induce unusual TC tracks."

 Air pollution is strongly linked to local and synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions, and tropical cyclones (TCs) are recognized as high-wind systems that facilitate pollutant scavenging. A key question is whether TC-triggered Rossby wave trains exert direct or remote indirect influences on pollutant concentrations. Using multi-source reanalysis datasets, this study examined the dynamic impacts of the Rossby wave trains from two successive TCs in 2023 (Doksuri, TC1; Khanun, TC2) on central China's pollutant concentrations. Results showed a prominent Rossby wave train was excited by TC1; its alternating anticyclone (A) - cyclone (C) structure drove periodic high-low pressure oscillations in the study area. Pollutant concentrations correlated with wave train phases: cyclonic phases (TC1/TC2/C1) brought strong ascent, enhanced winds, and precipitation, reducing PM2.5 and CO rapidly; anticyclonic phases (A0/A1/A2) caused subsidence and weak winds, worsening diffusion and increasing pollutants. TC1 directly affected local pollution by passing through the area. TC2 propagated northward over the ocean with no direct impact on the study area, but its wave train blocked mid-latitude energy transport, forcing mid-latitude high-pressure energy southward and inducing secondary pollution. This study is the first to quantify TC-Rossby wave train effects on pollutant diffusion (direct/indirect), providing a novel perspective for TC-air pollution links."
