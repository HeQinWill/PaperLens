We examined how water temperature, salinity, and primary production change during the ice-free season along the Sept-Îles coast (Qc, Canada). We found seasonal variation of the parameters and peaks of primary production at specific depths and months. These results provide a baseline to track future environmental changes. 
 Coastal ecosystems are highly dynamic and vulnerable to both climate changes and anthropogenic pressures. The Sept-Îles region, located in the northwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence, is a high-use subarctic coastal system with diverse urban, industrial and maritime activities. This study presents analyses of monthly water column profiles at 35 sites focusing on temperature, salinity and chlorophyll fluorescence, used as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass, during the ice-free season. Using a conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) sensor, water column profiles were collected from May to October 2022 along the coastline, at sites between 2- and 52- meters depth. Results revealed a thermocline developing in spring, intensifying in summer and disappearing in autumn. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations peaked below the thermocline in July, while secondary increases were recorded at the surface in September, consistent with observations of an autumn bloom in similar environments. These findings highlight the complex dynamic of physical and biological parameters in the coastal water column, and the importance of the timing of sampling to fully capture seasonal variability. To improve future research in the area, measuring nutrient concentrations would be essential for detecting potential upwelling events and better explaining phytoplankton variation during summer. This study provides a valuable baseline for future investigations and justifies the continuation of measurements of water column variability in the region, in the context of rapid climate change.

This study systematically investigates the evolution of shipping CO2 emissions associated with countries’ maritime export trade from 1995 to 2021 using a trade-driven approach and evaluates disparities in national emission patterns. Results show a shift from a high-income dominance toward a more balanced distribution, with growing contributions from upper-middle-income and emerging economies. While the global average GDP-normalized shipping emission intensity declined by 33.6% during the study period, substantial variations exist across economies. Middle-income countries once exhibited nearly twice the GDP-based emission intensity of high-income economies, but this gap has narrowed with economic diversification. Per capita shipping emissions saw only modest growth globally, yet differences across countries remain pronounced. High-income countries account for over half of global emissions despite representing only 15% of the world’s population, maintaining persistently above-average per capita levels. Major emitters─including the United States, Australia, Brazil, and China─show striking contrasts: Australia records both GDP- and population-normalized intensities well above the global average, whereas China’s values fall below it, underscoring structural inequities in the distribution of the shipping-related carbon burden. These findings highlight persistent disparities in maritime emissions and underscore the need for a differentiated, multimetric framework to guide equitable responsibility allocation."

While cotton supports essential aspects of human lifestyles, its cultivation results in substantial carbon emissions and water consumption, and sustainable production strategies remain insufficiently understood. Long-term survey data reveal that cotton production in China functions as a weak carbon sink during cultivation stage. We show that integrating optimized field management with comprehensive straw utilization can sharply improve carbon sequestration potential and reduce water consumption, while mitigating profit declines associated with the so-called “medium-scale trap”. These findings are critical for alleviating the environmental footprint of cotton producing and provide valuable insights for promoting global cotton sustainability while aligning environmental goals with farmers’ profits."

China’s pursuit of carbon neutrality and air quality goals should ideally promote the convergence of both national mitigation targets and regional equitable transition, but the two are rarely considered together. Here, we develop an environmentally extended multiregional input-output model for China, which covers multiple environmental impacts for three benchmark years, to investigate the performance of national CO2 and air pollutant reductions and the evolution of regional inequality. We present the realistic evidence that regional inequalities have worsened alongside China’s accelerating transition toward low-carbon and clean-air goals. International and interregional supply chains have jointly exacerbated the uneven distribution of economic benefits and environmental burdens, trapping the Northwest region, such as Xinjiang and Ningxia, in a lose–lose situation. Production efficiency improvement and consumption structure optimization can be promising ways to synergistically achieve national emission reductions and regional inequality alleviation, with the East Coast region (Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu) currently leading these ways. We advocate incorporating regional equitable transition into policy-making for CO2 and air pollutants coabatement, which will facilitate an inclusive green and clean development for China and other countries facing similar challenges."

In this study, three types covering nine HWs events were identified during summer 2023 (June–August) in Beijing, including daytime HWs (DHWs, 4 days), nighttime HWs (NHWs, 8 nights), and compound HWs (CHWs, 27 days). Twenty-eight days of O3 pollution (OP) occurred during the whole summer, among which 64% (18 out of 28) appeared during HWs. HWs elevated O3 concentrations by 27.3% comparing to non-HWs, while CHWs significantly amplified diurnal O3 fluctuations accompanied by the accumulation of reactive nitrogen (NOx, NOz, and NOy), indicting a stronger tendency toward O3-reactive nitrogen combined pollution. During HWs, NOx/NOy ratios were reduced, and secondary oxidized nitrogen NOz levels were elevated, which accelerated photochemical O3 production and promoted VOC-driven chain reactions, thereby intensifying and prolonging O3 pollution. O3 suppression was observed at temperatures of ∼38 °C, indicating a nonlinear and complex influence of HWs on the O3 formation. This work elucidates synergistic O3-reactive nitrogen transformation mechanisms under extreme HWs, providing a scientific foundation for refined regional pollution modeling and precision mitigation strategies."

Despite its importance, the prevalence, controlling factors, and microbial mediators of sulfur-based denitrification in aquifers remain largely unknown. By integrating multiple stable isotopes and genome-resolved metagenomics, we investigated the coupling of nitrogen and sulfur cycling along the groundwater flowpath from unconfined to confined alluvial-lacustrine aquifers in the Poyang Lake Plain, China. Isotope (i.e., δ15N–NO3–, δ18O–NO3–, δ34S–SO42–, δ18O–SO42–, δ18O–H2O, δ13C-DIC, and δ13C-DOC) fractionation and hydrogeochemical trends indicated a transition from nitrification-dominated processes in the unconfined aquifer to denitrification, sulfide oxidation, and sulfate reduction in the confined aquifer. A significant negative correlation between δ34S–SO42– and δ15N–NO3–, along with a significant positive correlation between genes involved in sulfide oxidation and nitrate reduction, suggested cryptic coupling between sulfide oxidation and nitrate reduction. Sulfur-autotrophic denitrifying metagenome assembly genomes encoding Calvin–Benson–Bassham carbon fixation and rTCA pathways, such as Burkholderiales, Rhodocyclaceae, and Sulfurimonas, were enriched in the confined aquifer and co-occurred with sulfate reducers (Pseudomonadota and Desulfobacterota). These results highlighted sulfur cycling consortia when sulfate was reduced to facilitate removal of nitrate via sulfur-based denitrification. These findings reveal the role of cryptic sulfur cycling in sustaining denitrification in aquifers, offering new insights into nitrogen–sulfur interactions in subsurface ecosystems."

Among current control strategies, Cu-exchanged SSZ-13 (Cu/SSZ-13) catalysts are widely recognized for their excellent low-temperature NH3-SCR activity and hydrothermal stability. However, their real-world performance is limited by sulfur poisoning, which deactivates active Cu sites through the formation of Cu-S species. Previous regeneration methods often result in incomplete recovery due to the formation of stable sulfates and/or insufficient redispersion of active Cu ions. In this study, we demonstrate that regeneration of sulfur-poisoned Cu/SSZ-13 in an inert atmosphere (Ar) at 800 °C can effectively prevent the oxidation of metastable Cu-S species into stable sulfate species while also promoting the decomposition of Cu-S species, thereby enabling a more complete recovery and redistribution of Cu ions into the zeolite framework. What is particularly noteworthy is that this regeneration method not only recovers the catalyst’s functionality but also leads to a significant enhancement in low-temperature NH3-SCR efficiency, outperforming the fresh catalyst. Advanced microscopic and spectroscopic analyses reveal that this enhancement is associated with increased formation of [ZCu2+(OH)]+ species located in the 8-membered rings of SSZ-13, which are known to be the most active sites for low-temperature NH3-SCR."

Most studies evaluating MP safety use pristine particles or those aged for a short period, thus overlooking the long-term physicochemical changes that MPs undergo once they are trapped in tissues. In this study, we observed pronounced alterations in the surface properties of polystyrene MPs after one year of exposure to artificial body fluids, including increased surface roughness and hydrophilicity. These changes enhanced the adhesion of biomolecules, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a typical pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Biomechanical analysis confirmed strong interactions between aged MPs and LPS. Once phagocytosed by macrophages, LPS-loaded aged MPs caused phagolysosomal damage and pyroptosis through noncanonical caspase-11 inflammasome activation, which in turn amplified canonical caspase-1-dependent inflammation. Importantly, the inflammatory impact of aged MPs was further validated in vivo in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model in which aged MPs aggravated disease severity. Collectively, these results identify aged MPs as “Trojan horses” with enhanced ability to transport harmful extracellular biomolecules like LPS into the cytoplasm, thereby reprogramming inflammasome signaling. This study highlights particulate stimuli, such as aged MPs, as a previously unrecognized bridge-linking PAMPs with danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)."

This study analyzed the dissemination pattern of pathogens from the gut of P. canaliculata to the aquatic environment. Combined with field surveys and mesocosm experiments, the impact of pathogens released by P. canaliculata on the native snail Cipangopaludina chinensis was evaluated. The direct lethal effects of the core bacterium on native snails were further demonstrated through in vivo and in vitro infection. Results show that 168 species of zoonotic pathogens existed in the gut of P. canaliculata, carrying 82 virulence factors and half of the high-risk antibiotic-resistant genes known to cause diseases. These pathogens released by P. canaliculata in the aquatic environment ultimately caused gut microbiota dysbiosis, mortality, and population decline in native snails, while it can be alleviated in the pathogen-limited P. canaliculata model. Aeromonas strains, the primary pathogen isolated from P. canaliculata, induced intestinal necrosis and death in native snails. Therefore, the release of pathogens is considered a previously overlooked invasion strategy of P. canaliculata, which poses a substantial public health threat within the One Health framework."

However, the mechanisms by which MPs interact with microbes during transit through soil animal digestive systems remain poorly understood. This study investigated the interactions between poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polystyrene (PS) MPs and gut-derived microbes using a biomimetic earthworm gut model. PET and PS MPs exhibited distinct microbial colonization patterns, driven by their physicochemical properties. PET MPs, with rougher surfaces, preferentially adsorbed cocci such as Paraclostridium, fostering high-density but low-activity bacterial populations. Conversely, PS MPs, with smoother surfaces, enriched bacilli such as Raoultella, supporting low-density but high-activity bacterial communities. PET MPs facilitated rapid bacterial proliferation but lacked long-term stability, whereas PS MPs created persistent microenvironments that increased the ecological risk of pathogen retention and spread. The oxidative degradation of MPs during gut transit enhanced bacterial adhesion by forming reactive surface functionalities. MPs significantly altered microbial diversity and served as selective vectors for microbial dissemination into soil ecosystems, disrupting the microbial dynamics. These findings underscore the dual role of MPs as microbial scaffolds and ecological disruptors, providing critical insights into their ecological impacts and guiding strategies to mitigate MP contamination and pathogenic risks."

Third-party commercial testing and peer-reviewed studies alike typically report inactivation metrics in terms of percent- or log-reductions observed from chamber experiments that imply a nearly complete elimination of infection risks. However, these metrics are highly dependent upon the experimental volume and duration, so they do not directly translate to actual effectiveness indoors. We reviewed 45 experiments across 14 published studies and converted reported reduction metrics into equivalent clean airflow rates (ECA). Different studies yielded distinct ECA distributions, suggesting that differences in experimental procedures, device specifications, or environmental conditions may be more important ECA determinants than the target pathogen or the underlying device technology. Study-averaged ECAs spanned between 1.4 and 134 m3/h, with the median study having an average ECA = 31 m3/h. Even small off-the-shelf HEPA-filter air cleaners typically provide ECAs that exceed the best-performing additive devices analyzed herein. Their low efficacy relative to alternatives, environmental factors that can affect performance, and chemical byproduct concerns are discussed in the context of test standard development and system selection."

Studying particle phase states from specific ambient source types is often challenging due to uncontrolled environmental conditions and multiple source contributions. However, a historic Pacific Northwest wildfire event occurred in September 2020, providing a rare opportunity to study a pseudosingle particle type ambient sample (i.e., wildfire) over time. Sampling was performed in Richland, Washington, capturing aged particles from shifting wildfire sources. In addition to source variability, temporal variation in individual particle phase state was observed. Despite this, single particle elemental compositions were homogeneous over time (≥87% carbonaceous) with no appreciable temporal variation in organic functional group abundances within individual particles either (e.g., 4% relative standard deviation in alkene contributions). While particle composition is indeed known to affect phase state, water uptake appeared to be the most important contributor to phase state variability among single particles here, as particle aspect ratios (related to phase state) linearly correlated with ambient relative humidity during sampling (R2 = 0.65). Therefore, while limited to a case study, meteorological considerations are found to convey greater comparative importance than particle composition for aged particle phase state predictions."

During pregnancy and early life, developing organisms are particularly vulnerable due to immature biological barriers and the dynamic nature of organogenesis. This review summarizes current evidence on maternal and early life exposure routes to MPs and NPs, including oral ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact, and transplacental transfer. Laboratory and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that microplastics can cross the placental barrier, potentially impairing placental function, altering fetal growth, and compromising pregnancy outcomes. Experimental data from animal models and in vitro systems suggest that maternal MP exposure may contribute to adverse neonatal development via multiple mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation, endocrine disruption, and epigenetic alterations. These toxicological pathways have been implicated in neurodevelopmental abnormalities, reproductive dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, often in a sex-dependent manner. Despite increasing experimental evidence, major knowledge gaps remain regarding human exposure levels, dose–response relationships, and long-term health implications. Future research should focus on improving detection sensitivity, establishing standardized exposure models, and developing targeted risk assessment frameworks to evaluate microplastic-associated health risks during pregnancy and early development."

We obtained daily mortality counts for all renal diseases, acute renal failure (ARF), and chronic kidney diseases (CKD) from 47 prefectures in Japan from 1979 to 2019. Heatwaves and cold spells were defined based on duration (2, 3, and 4 consecutive days) and intensity (95th, 97.5th, and 99th percentile thresholds for heatwaves and 5th and 2.5th percentile thresholds for cold spells) using prefecture-specific daily mean temperature percentiles. A two-stage time-stratified case-crossover analysis was conducted. Prefecture-specific estimates were derived in the first stage by comparing the risk on extreme event days to nonevent days, and the national-level estimate was obtained from a univariate random-effect meta-analytical model in the second stage. Added effects of heatwaves and cold spells were estimated by adjusting for mean temperatures in the first-stage models. Subgroup analyses by age (0–64, 65–84, and >85) and sex and temporal analyses across four subperiods were also conducted. The statistical significance of changes over time was checked by conducting pairwise comparisons between the risk estimates from the first (1979–1988) with the subsequent subperiods. Our study included 300,506 renal deaths during summer and 367,663 during winter. Heatwaves were associated with increased renal disease-related mortality where the highest relative risks (RRs) for renal mortality were observed at the 99th percentile threshold lasting for ≥4 days (99th, 4 days): RR = 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 1.05–1.17) for all renal causes, 1.17 (1.07–1.28) for ARF, and 1.11 (1.05–1.17) for CKD. Cold spells showed stronger effects, with the highest RRs at the 2.5th percentile threshold and 2-day duration: RR = 1.18 (1.11–1.25) for all renal mortality, 1.26 (1.01–1.58) for ARF, and 1.12 (1.01–1.25) for CKD. Added effects of heatwaves were observed, but not in the case of cold spells. Older adults aged 65 years and over are particularly vulnerable. Temporal analysis revealed a significant reduction in heatwave-associated mortality risk over time, suggesting possible adaptation. In conclusion, heatwaves and cold spells affect renal disease-related mortality, underscoring the necessity for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the health impacts of changing climate on renal health."

Martian paleoclimate models, however, have difficulty simulating climate conditions warm enough to maintain liquid water on early Mars. Reconciling the geologic record and paleoclimatic simulations of Mars is critical to understanding Mars' early history, atmospheric conditions, and paleoclimate. This study uses an adapted lake energy balance model to investigate the connections between Martian geology and climate. The Lake Modeling on Mars for Atmospheric Reconstructions and Simulations (LakeM2ARS) model is modified from an Earth‐based lake model to function in Martian conditions. We use LakeM2ARS to investigate the conditions necessary to simulate a lake in Gale crater. Working at a localized scale, we combine climate input from the Mars Weather Research & Forecasting general circulation model with geologic constraints from Curiosity rover observations to identify potential climatic conditions required to maintain a seasonally ice‐free lake. Our results show that an initially small lake system (10 m deep) with ∼50 mm monthly water input and seasonal ice cover would retain seasonal liquid water for over 100 years, demonstrating conditions close to long‐term lake survivability. These results are an important step in resolving the historic disconnect between climate and geology on Mars. Continued use and iteration of LakeM2ARS will strengthen connections between Mars' paleoclimate and geology to inform climate models and enhance our understanding of conditions on early Mars."

However, the dominant driver and its temporal evolution remain unclear. Here, we systematically quantified the relative contributions of these drivers and demonstrated that precipitation has historically been the dominant driver, followed by temperature. Under climate warming, however, precipitation's contribution is declining while temperature's role is becoming increasingly prominent. Despite inter‐model uncertainties, the multi‐model ensemble mean indicates that temperature is projected to surpass precipitation as the dominant driver in the majority (>15) of the 27 analyzed regions. An earlier transition (generally before 2060) is projected for regions including western North America, northern Asia, southeastern Asia, and central Africa. Our findings underscore a critical transformation in drought mechanisms and the urgency of implementing climate‐resilient drought adaptation frameworks in a warming climate."

Here we show that in a state‐of‐the art climate model the two properties have independent and fundamentally different impacts on zonal asymmetries of Northern Hemisphere extra‐tropical winter temperatures: The shortwave properties induce a tropospheric Rossby wave train apparently connected to changes in tropical convection. The longwave properties imprint a wavenumber 1‐like signal on surface temperatures related to altered stratospheric winds. The independence of these responses provides a useful starting point for analyzing the extra‐tropical temperature response to volcanic eruptions in both observations and models."

New self‐calibrating instruments may solve a long‐time issue of instrument drift, allowing new high precision observations. However, instruments on the seafloor may settle over days to months, potentially contaminating results. Here we present evidence for likely settling of two self‐calibrating instruments deployed along the RAPID mooring array, on the order of 8–14 cm. Settling is expected, and we model the settling based on Terzaghi's consolidation theory, which is well known in civil engineering applications. After the settling correction the difference between the two pressure records has a standard deviation of ∼1 cm water height equivalent. Settling is likely an important factor that should be considered in oceanographic and geodetic experimental design. We recommend longer term deployments of 5–10 years to allow for settling and/or selection of sites with thinner sandy sediments to minimize settling."

In this study, we employ an emission‐driven CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ configuration in the Community Earth System Model Version 2.2 (CESM2.2) and demonstrate the effect of incorporating detailed Short‐Lived Halogen (SLH) chemistry representation on both emission‐ and concentration‐driven CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ simulations in terms of global methane loss and overall chemical dynamics. The net impact of the updated SLH chemistry reduces ozone (O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$) and hydroxyl radical (OH) in both hemispheres, resulting in higher abundance and longer lifetime of carbon monoxide (CO) and CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$. Comparisons with NASA's Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission data show joint improvements in OH, O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$, CO and CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$. Further evaluation against CO measurements from NASA's Measurement of the Pollution in The Troposphere (MOPITT), CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ from JAXA's Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) confirms significant amelioration in modeled CO and CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$, especially in the Northern Hemisphere during winter and spring, correcting a common wintertime underestimation. The annual tropospheric CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ loss with OH is reduced from 573 to 504 TgCH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ yr−1 ${\text{yr}}^{-1}$ in 2017, resulting in an increase in lifetime of about 1.2 years, bringing it to approximately 10 years, which is well within the range of uncertainty in empirical estimates. In contrast, the estimated chlorine sink increases from 2 to around 15 TgCH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ yr−1 ${\text{yr}}^{-1}$. Additionally, we find that the sensitivity of the CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$’s chemical loss to CO emission changes is underestimated in the prescribed CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ simulations."

However, the causality between these stratospheric and tropospheric extreme events remains unclear due to the rarity of such downward coupling during Southern Hemisphere (SH) winter—previous Antarctic stratospheric warmings and their associated downward coupling have largely occurred during SH spring. Here we provide insights into the dynamics and climate impacts of wintertime Antarctic vortex variability during 1979–2023 and compare the climatological behavior of wintertime SH stratosphere‐troposphere coupling with that observed during mid‐winter 2024. During 1979–2023, compared to the springtime stratospheric polar vortex variability in the SH, which is characterized by variations in vortex strength and breakdown timing and its robust signature in surface climate, wintertime variability in the SH stratospheric circulation is marked by expansion and contraction of the vortex with generally weak linkages to surface circulation. The 2024 mid‐winter event mirrored many historical features of wintertime variability at stratospheric levels but had a much stronger signature in surface climate. It was unique with a record contraction of the vortex accompanied by record increases in polar stratospheric temperatures for July. These unusual stratospheric conditions atypically led to substantially higher‐than‐normal Antarctic ozone concentrations in July and August, delaying the development of the ozone hole, and record negative values in the SAM and extraordinary warmth over the Antarctic continent in early August 2024."

This study assessed the relationship between weather variables and stroke incidence, severity, mortality, and hospital stay in Douala, Cameroon. A retrospective review was conducted using medical records from three referral hospitals in Douala from January 2011 to December 2020. Adults (≥18 years) with neuroimaging‐confirmed ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes were included. Weather data: temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, and sunshine duration, were obtained from the national meteorological agency (ASECNA). Associations between weather parameters and stroke‐related outcomes were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Among 1,349 stroke cases (mean age 61 ± 13 years; 53% male), 65% were ischemic strokes. Stroke incidence peaked during the long rainy season (p = 0.053). Severe strokes were associated with the long dry season (OR = 1.88), low precipitation (OR = 1.74), and low sunshine (OR = 0.62), while the long rainy season was inversely associated with severity (OR = 0.60). Mortality was higher during the short rainy season, linked to high temperatures (p = 0.046) and moderate rainfall (p = 0.04). Longer hospital stays were associated with the long rainy season (mean difference of 2.3 days, p = 0.01), and were influenced by high wind (p = 0.023), heavy rain (p = 0.013), and low sunshine (p = 0.002).

 The ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition in perovskite structures and its underlying mechanism form the physical foundation for numerous applications such as high-performance energy storage, ultrafast information storage, and electrocaloric refrigeration. Understanding of ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition, especially the description of the transition dynamic process, is crucial for material design and device reliability enhancement. Most of the previous studies demonstrated that ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition are first-order transitions driven by atomic rearrangement, generally regarded as prototypical fast kinetic processes. Here, we report an irreversible ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition at low temperatures in Pb(Zr0.97Ti0.03)O3 as seen by neutron diffraction patterns. The in-situ variable-temperature transmission electron microscopy reveals that the ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition exhibits relaxation behavior and is a slow diffusional dynamic process, which corrects the previous understanding. Density functional theory simulations reveals that the irreversible transition behavior is due to variation of the transition energy barrier with temperature. Based on Density functional theory and experimental data, a multiscale phase-field model was developed to describe the transition dynamics and provide the theory limitation for the rate of ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition in Pb(Zr0.97Ti0.03)O3 at low temperatures, offering a physical basis for future material applications and device design.

The authors show that this accurate perception is achieved by inferring the observer’s viewing geometry from optic flow. 
 We move our eyes and head to sample the visual environment. While these movements are essential for survival, they greatly complicate the analysis of retinal image motion. Our brain must account for the visual consequences of self-motion to perceive the 3D layout and motion of objects in a scene. We show that traditional models of visual compensation for eye movements fail when the eye both translates and rotates, and we propose a theory that computes both motion and depth in more natural viewing geometries. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, humans exhibit distinct perceptual biases when different viewing geometries are simulated by optic flow, and these biases occur without training or feedback. A neural network model trained to perform the same tasks suggests that viewing geometry modulates the joint tuning of neurons for retinal and eye velocity to mediate these adaptive computations. Our findings unify previously separate bodies of work by demonstrating that the brain adaptively perceives the dynamic 3D environment according to viewing geometry inferred from optic flow. People typically perceive the motion and depth of objects correctly even during walking or running, when visual inputs change markedly.

Here, the authors show that GlpG is essential for the assembly of type 1 pili, a virulence factor required for colonization of bacteria in eukaryotic cells. 
 With the rise in antimicrobial resistance, understanding the virulence factors utilized by pathogenic E. coli is essential for the development of alternative therapeutics. While previous work has shown that disruption of the E. coli rhomboid protease gene glpG leads to defects in bacterial colonization, here we provide mechanistic insight into the loss of fitness. We show GlpG is essential for the assembly of type 1 pili, a virulence factor required for the colonization of eukaryotic cells. Since pili are critical for biofilm formation and bacterial persistence, the absence of GlpG proteolytic activity reduces the production of biofilm. Working towards new potential antimicrobial targets for treating infections, we show that biofilm formation is hampered by GlpG inhibition. Our data demonstrates that GlpG plays a key role in protein quality control of type 1 pili and alters the paradigm for GlpG proteolysis, previously implicated in the cleavage of only membrane embedded substrates.

 Magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) provides a promising candidate for the next-generation memory technology with high-energy efficiency and fast operation speed. Spin splitting band structure in nonrelativistic collinear antiferromagnet with de-coupled crystal and spin symmetry provides a unique way for the flexible and efficient control of the polarization and flow directions of the spin current. Here, by integrating the potential altermagnetic (101)-RuO2 writing channel with the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device, we demonstrate the all-electrical field-free altermagnetic spin splitting torque (SST)-driven switching of the perpendicular-MTJ in the 3-terminal altermagnetic SST-MRAM device, with the tilted spin polarization and the transversal flow of the spin current. The z-spin torque is further characterized by the altermagnetic SST-induced shift of the magnetic hysteresis loop, and the field-free altermagnetic SST-driven magnetic domain switching of the recording layer is directly observed by the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) microscope. Our research establishes groundwork for advancing the development of the altermagnetic SST-MRAM, paving the way for the future all-electrical, energy-efficient and high-endurance MRAM applications with separated writing/reading channels.

 Idiopathic short stature (ISS) remains a major pediatric challenge with unclear causes and inconsistent responses to growth hormone therapy. Here we show that plasma exosomes from children with ISS contain elevated hsa-miR-17-3p that disrupts growth signaling and impairs cartilage cell proliferation. Elevated miR-17-3p suppresses ZNF148/SOS1 signaling, linking molecular dysfunction to dietary exposure in ISS. To investigate environmental triggers, we developed a capsaicin-rich diet rat model that recapitulates ISS, showing normal Gh/Igf-1 levels but elevated plasma miR-17-3p. The diet induced mild gut inflammation, increasing miR-17-3p in intestinal and plasma exosomes. Fecal samples from ISS children exhibited similar elevations in miR-17-3p and inflammatory markers, linking spicy diets to ISS pathogenesis. Finally, engineered exosomes designed to silence miR-17-3p, combined with localized growth hormone therapy, restored growth plate function. These findings uncover a diet-driven exosome axis underlying ISS and suggest new therapeutic strategies for children in high-capsaicin regions.

 Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are a 32-member family of Class B GPCRs that have diverse cellular roles including mechanosensation, cell-fate determination, neurodevelopment, immune function and tumour biology. ADGRL4 is upregulated in the tumour microenvironment and is implicated in tumour pathogenesis across a broad range of malignancies. Inhibiting ADGRL4 is a potential therapeutic treatment for currently intractable cancers such as glioblastoma. Previous work suggested that ADGRL4 does not signal through G protein coupled pathways. However, using a sensitive bioluminescent assay, we demonstrate here that ADGRL4 couples weakly to the heterotrimeric G protein Gq, whilst there is no robust coupling to other G proteins (Gs, G12, Go) or β-arrestin 1 or 2. We determine the cryo-EM structure of ADGRL4 coupled to a heterotrimeric Gq complex to a resolution of 3.1 Å. The overall fold of ADGRL4 is similar to that of other aGPCRs, but the coupling to Gq is distinct with fewer interactions between the receptor and G protein. The structure is consistent with ADGRL4 being activated by its tethered agonist and represents an important step towards the development of potential inhibitors for the treatment of multiple tumour types.

Here, the authors introduce this unique coupling into the polariton system and demonstrate topological polariton condensation in lattices with negative coupling. 
 Coupling between quantum or classical degrees of freedom underpins a wide range of physical phenomena, from condensed matter systems to engineered photonic lattices. While positive coupling arising naturally from evanescent interactions has been extensively studied and employed, negative coupling unlocks unique phenomena that are challenging to realize with positive coupling alone. Exciton-polariton micropillars, celebrated for enabling topological lasers, reservoir computing, and quantum simulations, have primarily relied on positive coupling. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate negative coupling between two micropillars using an additional larger micropillar. By combining positively and negatively coupled micropillars, we construct a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) topological lattice with a significant topological gap of approximately 15 meV, where band inversion occurs at the center of the Brillouin zone (BZ), rather than at the edges as in conventional SSH lattices. Under non-resonant excitation, we achieve polariton condensation in the in-gap topological edge states at room temperature. Our study introduces a universal method to realize negative coupling in polariton systems, paving the way for novel polaritonic devices based on lattices with arbitrarily controlled coupling signs. Negative coupling is an intriguing mechanism for linking lattice sites, enabling phenomena unattainable with positive coupling alone.

 The cell-free biogenesis of the protein translation machinery is essential for the creation of a self-regenerating synthetic cell. Here, we demonstrate the autonomous and simultaneous biogenesis of all thirty proteins of the translation machinery of E. coli in a reconstituted transcription-translation system. We first establish self-regeneration of every translation protein by determining the threshold concentration required for its own synthesis from a synthetic gene coding for the protein, thereby demonstrating the functionality of all nascent proteins, separately. Simultaneous biogenesis of multiple translation proteins at their threshold results in delayed synthesis below detection levels. To achieve self-regeneration of multiple translation proteins, we induce boundary-free compartmentalization of the reaction by immobilizing the genes on a surface at high density. The co-localization of genes, molecular machinery, messenger RNA and nascent proteins at the surface create sufficient conditions to catalyze the simultaneous self-regeneration of sub-groups up to all thirty translation proteins, as measured by total internal reflection fluorescence on the surface. Our approach provides mechanistic insight and presents a general methodology for the biogenesis of cellular machines toward autonomous synthetic systems.

A more dynamic approach is proposed, accounting for the importance of green values that may be undermined or enhanced by policy. 
 Conventional approaches to policy design often neglect the plasticity of citizens’ beliefs and values upon which policy effectiveness and political sustainability depend. A consequence, by way of illustration, is that environmental policies may crowd out pre-existing green values. Our representative survey of 3,306 Germans finds that enforced restrictions to promote carbon-neutral lifestyles would trigger strong negative responses because they ‘restrict freedom’. This is true even among those who would adopt green lifestyles when voluntary, thus possibly undermining support for green political movements. These results combined with the long-term political consequences of the polarizing reactions to Covid mandates motivate a new approach to climate policy design. We set aside the conventional economic model assuming self-interested citizens, in which there could be no green values to crowd out. Instead, we propose a dynamic approach recognizing that (1) to succeed, essential policies including bans, carbon taxes and the promotion of new technologies must be both implementable and politically sustainable, entailing (2) a critical role for citizens’ green values, which (3) may be either diminished or cultivated, depending on policy design. Climate policies based on conventional economic models that assume that citizens are entirely self-interested may trigger negative responses, even among those who support green lifestyles.

Bednarz,Sensitivity of Arctic sea ice recovery to stratospheric aerosol injection latitude,"Sensitivity of Arctic sea ice recovery to stratospheric aerosol injection latitude 
 Under multiple anthropogenic global warming scenarios considered by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), Arctic sea ice is projected to disappear seasonally as early as 2035. Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) is a climate intervention strategy that has been proposed to mitigate some of the impacts of global warming. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of SAI in preserving Arctic sea ice, focusing on its sensitivity to the injection latitude of the aerosols. Using the 2nd version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) coupled with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM6), we analyze experiments with aerosol injection latitudes ranging from 45°S to 45°N. The results reveal that as the injection latitude shifts closer to the North Pole, Arctic sea ice rapidly recovers in both its extent and volume. This recovery is driven by coordinated shifts in clear-sky and cloud-related radiation, along with changes in surface reflectivity, that collectively reshape the surface energy balance in favor of ice growth. Importantly, we also find that, under fixed SAI injection rates, Arctic sea ice recovery varies substantially with injection latitude and does not scale directly with global mean surface temperature."

 This study identifies atmospheric rivers (ARs) as key mediators linking large-scale climate teleconnections, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific-North American pattern (PNA), and Arctic Oscillation (AO), to variations in vegetation activity (NDVI) and burned area (BA) across North America. The results highlight the central role of ARs in shaping regional fire regimes and improving prospects for seasonal fire prediction. Distinct spatial and lag-dependent responses emerge: ENSO-driven precipitation promotes vegetation greening in northwestern Canada at longer lags, whereas browning dominates Alaska and northeastern Canada. The PNA exerts a dominant influence, suppressing NDVI across the eastern United States and central Canada at longer lags, while promoting greening in Alaska at shorter ones. AO effects often counter those of ENSO, driving vegetation drying in the southern United States and southwestern Canada at short lags, and in central Canada and Alaska at longer timescales. ARs exert a strong control over burned area, particularly across northern Canada and Alaska. When AR variability is incorporated, much of the fire enhancement previously attributed to teleconnection phases is reversed, indicating that AR-teleconnection interactions play a pivotal role in modulating the timing and magnitude of vegetation and fire responses across North America.  The interactions between atmospheric rivers and large-scale climate teleconnections modulate the timing and magnitude of vegetation and fire responses across North America, according to remote sensing, teleconnection index, and reanalysis data analyses."

 The carbon use efficiency (CUE) of soil microbes is defined as the proportion of assimilated carbon (C) allocated to microbial growth than lost through respiration. CUE is a critical parameter in soil C cycling, and its response to external nutrient inputs (including nitrogen [N], phosphorus [P], and combined NP) could determine the change of soil C pool. However, the general pattern of CUE response to nutrient addition remains unclear. By conducting a global meta-analysis of 427 observations, we found that the nutrient addition had no significant overall effect on CUE, whether in the overall nutrient addition experiments or in experiments with different types of nutrient addition. The response of CUE to N addition was regulated by duration, with long-term addition (>10 year) leading to a decrease in CUE. We identified the aridity index as the most important predictor influencing CUE in response to N addition, while ecosystem type was the most key variable for CUE response to both P and NP additions. Global predictions showed future N inputs tends to enhance CUE across most regions, especially in cropland ecosystems. Overall, the effect of nutrient addition on CUE was relatively minor, providing key microbial evidence for understanding future soil C dynamics.

 The redox status of permafrost soils is a decisive factor for their nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, and greenhouse gas emissions. Although being associated with a variety of processes, data availability of continuous redox measurements in permafrost soils is scarce. Here, we provide a unique dataset covering three years of soil redox potential measurements, obtained from a monitoring approach at three research sites near Fairbanks, Alaska. Redox potential pattern in the permafrost soil active layer showed large seasonal differences, with reducing conditions in the short summer/autumn to largely oxidizing conditions in winter and spring. However, conditions for methane production were at no time recorded in the three years. Especially the freezing and thawing had substantial impact on the redox status, highlighting that assessment of redox conditions in permafrost soils should be extended beyond the typical summer observation periods.

 Agricultural irrigation, energy use, and carbon emissions are interconnected, creating challenges for sustainable food production under climate and resource pressures. Optimizing irrigation water allocation is essential for improving productivity and reducing environmental impacts. Here, we develop a high-resolution water-food-energy-carbon optimization framework that allocates irrigation water across space and time to enhance resource efficiency in China. We combine multi-source observational and satellite datasets and examine future crop distribution scenarios to estimate irrigation demand and evaluate alternative allocation strategies. The framework quantifies effects on water productivity, yield stability, energy requirements, and greenhouse gas intensity. We find that increasing irrigation water productivity reduces energy consumption per unit of yield by about 37 percent and lowers carbon intensity by about 13 percent. Integrating irrigation with low-carbon energy further decreases energy use to about 190 kilowatt-hours per hectare. These findings show the potential of precision irrigation to support sustainable and lower-carbon agricultural development in China. Increased irrigation water productivity, crop yields stabilization, mitigation of energy consumption and carbon emissions are possible using a high-resolution water-food energy-carbon optimization framework that integrates multi-source datasets and future crop distribution scenarios."

 The timing of leaf senescence critically shapes ecosystem dynamics by regulating plant productivity and nutrient cycling. While species diversity is recognized as a key driver of ecosystem functioning, its effect on autumn senescence remains poorly understood. To address this gap, here we integrated field observations from Northern China and global remote sensing data to investigate grassland autumn senescence. Our analyses reveal that higher species diversity accelerates autumn senescence, even after controlling for climate and soil factors. Mechanistically, this relationship is mediated by resource allocation strategies: enhanced species diversity promotes the allocation of resources to belowground biomass, thereby reducing aboveground resource availability and triggering earlier senescence. Our findings highlight a negative relationship between species diversity and the timing of autumn senescence in semi-arid grasslands, which facilitates increased carbon allocation to belowground compartments and accelerates the seasonal carbon cycle, offering critical insights into global carbon flux exchange under future climate warming. Enhanced species diversity promotes the allocation of resources to belowground biomass, accelerates seasonal carbon cycle, thereby reducing aboveground resource availability triggering earlier senescence, according to field observations from Northern China coupled with global remote sensing data."

 Autumn leaf fall is a critical phenological event in temperate deciduous forests, with important ecological and socioeconomic implications. Traditional estimates based on daytime vegetation indices primarily capture foliage color changes rather than the actual timing of leaf fall, and are often affected by mixed-pixel effects that reduce the accuracy. This study proposes a novel workflow for detecting the autumn leaf fall date (LFD) using nighttime light (NTL) data in urban areas, validated through in-situ observations from phenological cameras and city-scale assessments. Results showed that NTL-derived LFDs closely matched in-situ observations across three cities (New York City, Boston, and Beijing), with an RMSE of around 5 days and a bias of 0.77 days. In Beijing, both interannual (2012–2024) and spatial variations (2024) in LFD were delayed by higher preseason temperature and precipitation but advanced by greater strong-wind frequency, consistent with known autumn phenological controls and supporting the reliability of the NTL-based approach. These results demonstrate that NTL data can provide more accurate and interpretable LFD estimates than traditional daytime remote sensing, enabling detailed city-scale mapping. The use of NTL-derived LFD dynamics facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of their spatiotemporal patterns in urban environments and their linkages to climate change and human activities."

 Black Carbon (BC), generated mainly by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, reduces snow albedo by increasing solar radiation absorption, which enhances surface warming and accelerates snow ablation. This effect is particularly relevant in snow-dominated basins near emission sources. However, limited atmospheric and depositional BC measurements restrict the assessment of its spatial and temporal variability in mountain catchments. This study estimates past (2006–2022) and future (2023–2035) atmospheric BC levels in the Juncalillo River basin, Central Andes of Chile. BC concentrations in snow (BCCS) were inferred using an asymptotic radiative transfer model (ART) and subsequently used to estimate atmospheric BC through a statistical model. Future BC was projected under two contrasting scenarios: (1) climate change conditions using the IPSL-CM5A-MR GCM with Quantile Delta Mapping, and (2) increased vehicular traffic on the CH-60 road (primary emission source in the basin). BCCS ranged from 160 to 520 ng g−1, with 11–20 % higher values within 1 km of the road. Atmospheric BC in 2006–2022 averaged 0.12 μg m−3 at the basin scale, with a non-significant increasing trend. Climate change projections suggest reduced BC (mean 0.10 μg m−3) with a significant negative trend, whereas the traffic-based scenario predicts an increase to 0.21 μg m−3 and a significant positive trend. These contrasting outcomes highlight the need to explicitly consider BC emission sources when evaluating future cryosphere changes in mountain basins."

 Monitoring carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is considered an effective approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Simulating CO2 concentration variations using atmospheric chemistry models can compensate for the spatial and temporal limitations of ground-based and satellite observations. In this study, the WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry) model was employed to simulate CO2 concentrations over central and eastern China from 2019 to 2021. The reliability of the simulation results was verified through comparisons with satellite data from OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2), OCO-3 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3), and GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite). Additionally, the results were validated against observational data from TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network) and WDCGG (World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases). The RMSE of the WRF-Chem simulation results compared to TCCON and WDCGG station observations were 2.146 ppm and 2.239 ppm, respectively, with R of 0.716 and 0.825. When compared to OCO-2, OCO-3, and GOSAT satellite observations, the RMSE were 2.000 ppm, 2.080 ppm, and 1.827 ppm, respectively, with R values of 0.792, 0.831, and 0.837. Based on a comparative analysis integrating WRF-Chem simulations from 2009 to 2021, this study reveals an upward trend in XCO2 concentrations over China, with an average annual growth rate of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 ppm. Although the growth rate slowed during 2019 to 2020, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, concentrations continued to increase annually. This result indicates that short-term variations in anthropogenic emissions can moderate the rate of increase but do not alter the long-term trend. The consistency between simulated CO2 concentrations, MEIC inventory emission trends, and ground-based observations further validates the simulation accuracy and suggests the reliability of MEIC in characterizing China's carbon emission changes during the pandemic."

 The Arctic Oscillation (AO), the dominant mode of extratropical Northern Hemisphere circulation, is known to influence midlatitude climate variability, but its impacts on tropical rainfall–particularly over the Maritime Continent (MC)–remain unclear. Here, we examine the influence of the boreal spring AO on midsummer (July–August) MC precipitation during the period 1979–2023. The results reveal a significant negative relationship between midsummer MC precipitation and the preceding March–April AO. Further examination identifies a physical mechanism linking the two: during the negative phase of the March–April AO, atmosphere–ocean interactions generate warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Atlantic that persist from March to August. These mid–latitude SST anomalies in the North Atlantic trigger an atmospheric wave train that propagates from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific, ultimately inducing pronounced westerly wind anomalies in the upper troposphere and easterly wind anomalies in the lower troposphere over the tropical western Pacific in July–August. This circulation pattern enhances vertical wind shear, promoting anomalous ascent via dynamic pumping and increasing rainfall.
