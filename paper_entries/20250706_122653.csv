While their occurrence has historically been attributed primarily to anthropogenic sources, growing evidence indicates that substantial natural HOC are stored in terrestrial ecosystems. As an enigmatic pool of soil organic matter, the molecular diversity of soil HOC remains largely unknown. Here, we establish a method to differentiate the speciation and molecular characteristics of soil extractable HOC using (ultra)high-resolution mass spectrometry, optimized through sample extraction solvents and cleanup strategies. Analyzing soil samples from six forest sites across eastern China, we revealed that natural HOC were present in both organic- and water-extractable fractions in all samples, comprising 0.2–14.4% of the total signal abundance. Lipid- and protein-like compounds were more abundant in organic-extractable HOC, while lignin- and lipid-like compounds dominated water-extractable HOC. Furthermore, distinct molecular characteristics were found among the two terrestrial-derived HOC fractions and disinfection byproducts (DBP) commonly detected in aquatic systems, with increasing oxidation and aromaticity, along with decreasing saturation and biolability. We propose a conceptual model describing the divergent molecular properties of natural terrestrial HOC and anthropogenic DBP across the soil–water interface, providing new insights into the different origins and fate of these HOC pools."

Herein, a new strategy is proposed to achieve simultaneous pollutant removal and Ag recovery in an expanded water self-purification system based on Mo–SnS2 quantum dots (MSS QDs) with dual-reaction-center (DRC). The innovative discovery is that the electrons of pollutants are finally utilized by Ag+ and dissolved oxygen through the constructed interfacial process without any sacrificial agent or additional energy consumption. Especially for antibiotics, one of the typical emerging contaminants (ECs), the degradation rate reaches 100% in a very short time. In N2 environment, the Ag recovery rate even reaches 94%. It is estimated that the cost of wastewater treatment is only $0.01/m3 (USD), and it even comes with huge benefits from Ag recovery in this expanded water self-purification system. This work provides novel technical references for developing multifunctional and low-consumption water purification technologies in response to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals."

We develop a novel framework to dynamically monitor the wetting progression of hydrophobic MD membranes and quantitatively describe the wetting status changes by implementing four-electrode mode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We decouple the membrane impedance into resistance and capacitance components, which are then translated into air gap span and wetted pore fractions. Distinguishing the wetting progression and the occurrence of pore breakthroughs, this framework successfully depicts the disparate wetting patterns of hydrophobic membranes induced by surfactants and low-surface-tension liquids. We show that the ability to instantaneously capture the wetting progression makes our framework particularly attractive for MD operations accompanied by slow wetting. EIS applied in our framework further reveals that a membrane of a randomly porous structure incurs a stepwise wetting front advancing by low-surface-tension liquids, as opposed to the single pore breakthrough event in the membrane of straight pores. Combined with the internal surface area and the pore size analyses, this illustration by EIS is used to model a randomly porous membrane as tortuous pores with multiple ‘necks’ of local minimum pore sizes."

This study is the first to uncover the inherent mechanisms of the enhancing effects of humic acid (HA) on the UVA/PI process. Accelerated degradation of the model compound naproxen (NAP) and six other structurally diverse compounds was observed, with enhancement factors of first-order rate constants varying from 1.2 to 5.5 in the presence of 2 mgC/L HA. The excited triplet of HA (3HA*), generated from HA photolysis, was identified as the dominant intermediate, and it reacts rapidly with PI at a diffusion-controlled second-order rate constant of about 1.19 × 109 M–1s–1. This interaction led to the generation of the hydroxyl radical (•OH) and ozone (O3), with •OH as the predominant oxidant responsible for over 70% of NAP degradation. Aromatic ketone moieties within HA were potential triplet candidates, as suggested by the model triplet sensitizer. Additionally, Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) was found to similarly enhance the performance of the UVA/PI process, indicating that this effect may extend to other natural organic matter sources. This study offers a novel perspective on PI-based advanced oxidation processes, revealing that HA can serve as an in situ enhancer to drive pollutant degradation with reduced reliance on chemical activators. This work not only advances the understanding of UVA/PI processes but also proposes a sustainable approach for optimizing water treatment systems."

The method exhibits strong robustness across a wide range of reactor configurations and components, including variations in separator materials, gas diffusion electrode (GDE) properties, anode types, SSE compositions, and electrocatalysts. Comparative analysis with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirms the reliability of the conductivity-based method, yielding an average relative error of 6.1% in concentration and FE.

We employ the Weather Research and Forecasting model with two different CD parameterizations and find that changing CD markedly affects boundary‐layer convergence and outer rainband evolution. In particular, the latest CD scheme with larger surface drag coefficient at wind speeds less than 45 m s−1 yields higher surface stress and stronger boundary‐layer convergence in the outer core, thereby enhancing rainband convection and triggering earlier formation of a more coherent secondary eyewall structure compared to the scheme with smaller, nearly constant CD at wind speeds greater than 45 m s−1. These findings underscore the fundamental role of surface friction in shaping TC structure, with direct implications for operational TC forecasting, especially during eyewall replacement cycles."

This has the potential to create meteorological feedback and large air quality impacts, but observations of smoke shading and induced local flows are rare. Mobile truck‐based Doppler lidar observations during the California Fire Dynamics Experiment (CalFiDE) in August and September 2022 provide a novel data set of smoke shading events. The truck‐based lidar conducted measurements of horizontal and vertical winds while underway, along with qualitative smoke backscatter, allowing a study of boundary layer (BL) dynamics in and out of the smoke shaded areas. An in situ temperature sensor on the truck recorded air temperature. Smoke shaded versus clear‐sky temperature differences of up to 8°C were observed over 12 km along a valley floor in complex terrain. Using vertical velocity variance as a measure of turbulent mixing, smoke shading reduced BL mixing by up to two orders of magnitude, preventing the development of an afternoon convective BL in some cases. Temperature gradients also resulted in thermally driven flows wherein the cold smoky air mass undercut warmer ambient air. One density current case was observed with a strong opposing flow resulting in a convergent updraft and shear‐induced vortices atop the smoke‐filled density current. In another case, the flow was impeded by complex terrain resulting in a slower‐moving smoke front and a temperature gradient that lagged behind the front."

Global warming increases heatwaves frequency, affecting sources and sinks of Mgly. Thus, studies on Mgly observations during heatwaves become increasingly urgent. Here, we combined field measurements using Vocus proton transfer reaction time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (Vocus PTR‐ToF‐MS), box model, and the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF‐Chem) to investigate the impacts of heatwaves on Mgly at a suburban site in eastern China during a prolonged heatwave influenced summer in 2022. After verifying that Vocus PTR‐ToF‐MS accurately detects Mgly and eliminating ion fragmentation artifacts of isoprene, we discovered that the heatwave doubled Mgly concentrations. This was attributed to a significant rise of isoprene—the dominant precursor of Mgly as confirmed by box modeling. The heatwave also altered photolysis and oxidation of Mgly and emission characteristics of isoprene, leading to an earlier peak and then a sudden drop of Mgly in the morning. This was different from the consistent peaks with air temperatures observed during non‐heatwave period. The concentrations of Mgly and isoprene showed positive correlations with air temperatures below 33°C, whereas both species' concentrations decline as temperatures exceeded 35°C. Additionally, WRF‐Chem underestimated isoprene and slightly overestimated Mgly. It could not capture the trends of Mgly and the discrepancies between model and measurements exacerbated when heatwave occurred. This study highlights the significant impact of heatwaves on Mgly and provides a benchmark for future model optimization."

Frölicher,Permafrost Thaw Impact on Remaining Carbon Budgets and Emissions Pathways in 2°C and 3°C Global Warming Scenarios,"High‐latitude frozen soils contain a vast store of organic matter, a potential source of greenhouse gases due to permafrost thaw. Understanding natural carbon cycle responses to climate change is crucial for emission reduction strategies. We use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model, driven by the Adaptive Emission Reduction Approach (AERA), to assess emission pathways for limiting global warming to 2°C and 3°C relative to preindustrial levels, while accounting for frozen soil carbon (FSC). We found that thawing FSC makes 122 PgC under 2°C and 229 PgC under 3°C warming, available for decomposition with about 75% reaching the atmosphere as carbon‐dioxide by 2298. Emission pathways that include the release of FSC diverge from their respective reference simulations without permafrost between the middle (2°C) and end (3°C) of the current century. By 2298, remaining carbon budgets are reduced by ∼13% (115 PgC) for 2°C and ∼11% (156 PgC) for 3°C stabilization levels. Annual permafrost emissions average ∼0.7 PgC/yr for 3°C and ∼0.3 PgC/yr for 2°C during the simulation period (2025–2298). However, temporary emission peaks reaching half of present‐day annual fossil fuel emissions (∼5 PgC) are possible. Surprisingly, while negative emissions are required for both reference simulations, only the simulation for the 3°C warming, accounting for FSC, requires negative fossil fuel emissions. This occurs because the FSC release causes an earlier initiation of emission reduction by AERA, resulting in a smoother emission curve. These findings underscore the importance of factoring in carbon released from permafrost thaw in mitigation action."

Climate change alters the suitability of mosquito vectors, affecting viral transmission. We assessed the global dengue transmission potential and suitable months under future climate scenarios by integrating the mosquito‐borne virus suitability index (Index P) with temperature and humidity projections from 12 global climate models. A substantial expansion of dengue risk zones from tropical to temperate regions was projected. The magnitude and pace of dengue risk escalation in China and the U.S. far exceed other temperate regions, with a considerable increase in at‐risk population and exposed land areas. In contrast, Europe exhibits a more delayed and moderate increase in dengue risk. In the SSP245 scenario for the 2050s, high dengue suitability zones are prominently located in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and sub‐Saharan Africa with emergent areas in southern North America and East Africa. By 2100, these zones expand to southern China and northern Australia. Under the SSP585 high‐emission scenario, the global dengue risk landscape shifts dramatically, with extensive risk zones emerging in the southeastern United States, China, and southern Europe, while some tropical regions such as Brazil and India experience a notable decline in transmission suitability due to extreme heat stress. By extending Index P to long‐term projections, this study uncovers both underappreciated early surges in temperate regions and unexpected declines in overheated tropics. These insights are critical for improving early warning systems in newly exposed populations."

While greenhouse gas influences on temperature extremes are well established, the impacts of other anthropogenic forcings, particularly aerosols, remain inadequately characterized. Here, we quantify the distinct contributions of greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols, and natural forcings to extreme heatwave metrics from the pre‐industrial period. Globally, changes in the duration of heatwave events and cumulative heat are +2.77 ± 0.85 days and +1.76 ± 0.31°C2 attributed to greenhouse gases, and −1.10 ± 0.34 days and −0.85 ± 0.14°C2 due to anthropogenic aerosols, respectively, over the past 3 decades relative to pre‐industrial levels. This indicates that aerosols substantially masked greenhouse gas effects until the 1990s. Under current mitigation policies, declining aerosol emissions have exacerbated heatwave intensification at rates of +1.07 ± 0.32 days decade−1 and +0.47 ± 0.09°C2 decade−1 for duration and cumulative heat respectively, exceeding the intensification attributable to greenhouse gases alone. Heatwave intensification has been driven primarily by reduced cloud cover and increased shortwave radiation resulting from weakening aerosol forcing, especially in Central North America and Europe. However, the regional climate changes driven by greenhouse gases and aerosols exhibit spatial heterogeneity, highlighting the necessity for geographically targeted mitigation strategies."

However, most analyses of extreme precipitation are conducted at fixed‐time intervals, which may lead to misconceptions of the spatial‐temporal changes and causes, hindering scientific understanding and engineering prevention.

The national average annual‐maximum persistent precipitation (Rx1event) was 2.5 times greater than extremes for fixed‐time precipitation (Rx1day) historically, and 2.8 times higher in the future period. Although Rx1day increased faster than Rx1event in the historical period, it is projected to grow more slowly than Rx1event in all three future scenarios. Both Rx1day and Rx1event exhibit Hook structures responding to temperature. The Peak temperatures of Hook structures are expected to rise by 2–6°C with projected future climate change, causing the precipitation‐temperature response curve to shift to the high‐value direction, thereby increasing the magnitude of Rx1day by 5%–12% and Rx1event by 22%–29%.

Wimberly,Integrating Wind Speed Into Climate‐Based West Nile Virus Models: A Comparative Analysis in Two Distinct Regions,"Since its introduction to North America in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has become the most widespread mosquito‐borne disease in the United States. Climatic conditions significantly influence transmission dynamics. While temperature, precipitation, and humidity are known to affect mosquito populations and virus replication, wind speed is often neglected in transmission models despite its potential to alter mosquito behavior and facilitate mosquito dispersal. This study incorporates wind speed into climate‐based WNV models to compare its effects in Louisiana and South Dakota, two U.S. states with contrasting climates, land cover, and vector and host species. From 2004 to 2022, we analyzed weekly WNV human case data in relation to daily meteorological data. The relationships were modeled using logistic regression with distributed lag effects. Incorporating wind speed consistently enhanced the fit of climate‐based models across both states, as evidenced by the Akaike Information Criterion. Higher‐than‐normal wind speeds were associated with decreased WNV cases over specific lag periods, suggesting that increased wind speed may inhibit mosquito activity and reduce virus transmission. Differences in how temperature and moisture‐related variables influenced the two regions highlight the importance of considering regional climatic contexts. These findings demonstrate that incorporating wind speed can enhance meteorological models of mosquito‐borne diseases and reinforce the importance of considering a broader range of climatic factors beyond temperature and precipitation. Understanding these regional variations is essential for predicting local climatic influences on disease transmission, which can support the implementation of more targeted and effective public health strategies."

Timely antidote administration is crucial for patients at risk of developing acute liver failure. A rapid point-of-care (POC) assay is required to identify high-risk patients with fit-for-purpose sensitivity and specificity. Here we show that by measuring a circulating biomarker, cytokeratin-18 (K18), accurate detection of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is possible. To achieve this, we created an in vitro diagnostic medical device designed to quantitatively detect serum K18, consisting of a Lateral Flow Immunoassay (LFIA) paired with a bespoke handheld Raman Reader (HRR) to produce quantitative surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The diagnostic was assessed in 2 performance evaluation studies using 199 serum samples from individuals following POD. The device achieves diagnostic accuracy for DILI with a specificity of 94% and sensitivity of 82%. Here we show that SERS-LFIA can rapidly identify patients with DILI, allowing individualised treatment pathways. There is an unmet clinical need for a rapid point-of-care tests to identify patients at high-risk of developing acute liver failure following a paracetamol overdose.

 Discovering governing equations of complex network dynamics is a fundamental challenge in contemporary science with rich data, which can uncover the hidden patterns and mechanisms of the formation and evolution of complex phenomena in various fields and assist in decision-making. In this work, we develop a universal computational tool that can automatically, efficiently, and accurately learn the symbolic patterns of changes in complex system states by combining the excellent fitting capability of deep learning with the equation inference ability of pre-trained symbolic regression. We perform extensive and intensive experimental verifications on more than ten representative scenarios from fields such as physics, biochemistry, ecology, and epidemiology. The results demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness and efficiency of our tool compared to state-of-the-art symbolic regression techniques for network dynamics. The application to real-world systems including global epidemic transmission and pedestrian movements has verified its practical applicability. We believe that our tool can serve as a universal solution to dispel the fog of hidden mechanisms of changes in complex phenomena, advance toward interpretability, and inspire further scientific discoveries.

Here, authors create, measure and braid Fibonacci anyons on a superconducting processor obtaining golden-ratio and sample the anyon-free state to estimate chromatic polynomials. 
 The remarkable complexity of a topologically ordered many-body quantum system is encoded in the characteristics of its anyons. Quintessential predictions emanating from this complexity employ the Fibonacci string net condensate (Fib SNC) and its anyons: sampling Fib-SNC would estimate chromatic polynomials while exchanging its anyons would implement universal quantum computation. However, physical realizations remained elusive. We introduce a scalable dynamical string net preparation (DSNP) that constructs Fib SNC and its anyons on reconfigurable graphs suitable for near-term superconducting processors. Coupling the DSNP approach with composite error-mitigation on deep circuits, we create, measure, and braids Fibonacci anyons; charge measurements show 94% accuracy, and exchanging the anyons yields the expected golden ratio ϕ with 98% average accuracy. We then sample the Fib SNC to estimate chromatic polynomial at ϕ + 2 for several graphs. Our results establish the proof of principle for using Fib-SNC and its anyons for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and aim at a classically hard problem.

 The ring-opening addition of bicyclo[1.1.0]-butanes (BCBs) represents a straightforward and efficient strategy for the synthesis of polyfunctionalized cyclobutanes, which are crucial scaffolds in pharmaceuticals and drug candidates.

 Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) define the surface biology of Gram-negative bacteria, with roles in adhesion, transport, catalysis and signalling. Specifically, porin beta-barrels are common diffusion channels, predominantly monomeric/trimeric in nature. Here we show that the major OMP of the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, PopA, differs from this architecture, forming a pentameric porin-like superstructure. Our X-ray and cryo-EM structures reveal a bowl-shape composite outer β-wall, which houses a central chamber that encloses a section of the lipid bilayer. We demonstrate that PopA, reported to insert into prey inner membrane, causes defects when directed into Escherichia coli membranes. We discover widespread PopA homologues, including likely tetramers and hexamers, that retain the lipid chamber; a similar chamber is formed by an unrelated smaller closed-barrel family, implicating this as a general feature. Our work thus defines oligomeric OMP superfamilies, whose deviation from prior structures requires us to revisit existing membrane-interaction motifs and folding models.

 Developing acid-stable and active ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for facilitating the large-scale applications of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) for hydrogen production. Here, we propose a strain heterogeneity engineering strategy to simultaneously enhance the OER stability and activity of RuO2 electrocatalysts by introducing single-atom platinum (Pt).

These performance metrics highlight its potential for practical applications. Experiments and calculations analyses confirm that the bulk tensile strain effectively stabilizes the entire structure of electrocatalysts, while the regions of compressive strain are identified as highly active catalytic sites, where the weakened binding energy of oxo-intermediates improves the catalytic activity.

 This study applied Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to PM10 speciation datasets from 24 urban sites across six European countries (France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland) to perform a detailed source apportionment (SA) analysis. By using a consistent source apportionment tool for all datasets, the study enhances the comparability of PM10 SA results across urban Europe. The results identified seven major PM10 sources including road traffic, biomass burning, crustal/mineral sources, secondary aerosols, industrial emissions, sea salt, and heavy oil combustion (HOC). Road traffic emerged as the predominant source of PM10 in urban areas, with contributions varying by location, but representing as much as 41% in high-traffic zones. Biomass burning was detected at 23 sites, contributing 8% to 41% on yearly averages, with substantial increase in winter. Crustal sources were present at all sites (3–33%). Industrial sources contributed relatively less PM10 mass, which was identified at 10 sites with contributions ranging from 2% to 14%. Secondary inorganic and organic aerosol, consisting primarily of ammonium nitrates and sulfates, and organic matter, formed a portion of the PM10 mass (5–41%). These secondary factors are primarily influenced by anthropogenic emissions, including the various combustion processes. Sea salt, predominantly found in coastal areas, contributed between 4% and 21%, reflecting the impact of the marine environments on air quality. This source was very often ‘aged’ (mixed with anthropogenic pollutants from different origins). Additionally, HOC, especially emits from shipping activities, and traced by V and Ni, was also a frequent contributing source (2–15% for 9 sites), indicating a need for more stringent emission controls. The chemical comparison is performed which indicates road traffic and secondary aerosols, showed consistent chemical profiles across sites, while industrial, HOC, and crustal sources displayed significant site-specific variability. These findings underscore the need for tailored air quality strategies according to local sources of emissions and the importance of long-term PM speciation monitoring for effective pollution control."

 Isoprene is the dominant nonmethane volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted into the atmosphere globally, with important atmospheric chemistry impacts on air quality and climate. One crucial intermediate in its gas-phase oxidation is isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX), which contributes significantly to the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). It is generally accepted that IEPOX is efficiently formed in remote forested regions with a sufficiently low NO/HO2 ratio. Here, we show that the oxidation of isoprene hydroxynitrates (IHN) can be an alternative, efficient, NO-driven pathway leading to the formation of IEPOX in urban areas where moderate to high NO concentrations exist. Field measurements from the megacity of Beijing show that this pathway contributes to more than 50% of IEPOX production during the morning and early afternoon. The results improve our understanding of the NOx dependence of SOA formation in polluted areas, where anthropogenic emissions can significantly enhance biogenic SOA formation."

 Low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors enable high-resolution urban air quality monitoring but face challenges from offsets, scaling mismatches, and drift. We propose an adaptive trust-based calibration framework that first corrects systematic errors and then dynamically adjusts model complexity based on sensor reliability. Extensive simulations and real-world deployment in Zurich, Switzerland validate the approach. Each sensor’s trust score integrates four indicators: accuracy, stability, responsiveness, and consensus alignment. High-trust sensors receive minimal correction, preserving baseline accuracy, while low-trust sensors leverage expanded wavelet-based features and deeper models. Results show mean absolute error (MAE) reductions of up to 68% for poorly performing sensors and 35–38% for reliable ones, outperforming conventional calibration methods. By using trust-weighted consensus, the framework reduces dependence on large training datasets and frequent re-calibrations, ensuring scalability. These findings demonstrate that dynamic, trust-driven calibration can substantially enhance low-cost sensor network accuracy across both controlled scenarios and complex real-world environments."

 The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (ca. 183 million years ago) marks a global mass extinction coincident with dramatic changes in climate and ocean circulation, likely driven by large igneous province emplacement. Rapid carbon dioxide release may have induced global warming, widespread ocean deoxygenation, and ocean acidification. To constrain the magnitude of ocean acidification, we present boron isotope data from three different carbonate components, lime mud (micrite), brachiopods, and bivalves, from two marine sections in SW Europe. Only data from micrite shows a temporary decrease in boron isotope composition during the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, recording an ocean acidification event, which we reproduce using a coupled biogeochemical model. The contrasting stability of boron isotope values shown by bivalves and brachiopods suggests that the investigated taxa may have been able to physiologically buffer changes in ocean pH, and are therefore poor targets for the interrogation of pH changes in Earth history.

We first infer the strength of the stratospheric overturning circulation using satellite measurements of nitrous oxide; the mass flux at about 18 km is then used to compute the loss of CFC-11, CFC-12, and CCl4. We confirm that anomalous surface measurements of CFC-11 from 2013 to 2018 cannot be attributed to variability in stratospheric transport alone, and we infer near-steady CCl4 emissions since 2013. Atmospheric lifetimes (50, 86, and 41 yr) independent of previous work are also computed using loss rates.

 Temporarily impounded liquid water on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), prominently represented as supraglacial lakes (SGLs), may enhance ice flow and modulate surface meltwater runoff, serving as a dynamic indicator of the cryohydrologic cycle. Despite their importance in understanding glacier mass balance and regional climate change, a detailed description of SGLs and their intra-annual fluctuations across the entire GrIS remains understudied. Here, we present a deep learning-based approach to automatically map SGLs from passive optical satellite imagery across the entire GrIS during the melt seasons of 2017–2022. Approximately 150,000 Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images were utilized, each representing a 5-day average composite at a 10 km × 10 km grid resolution, with the Landsat images used as possible supplements. SGL predictions by the proposed method demonstrate high performance, achieving an F1-score of up to 0.959 compared to the independent test dataset. This high accuracy enables a detailed analysis of the key role SGLs play in enhancing surface ablation by absorbing solar radiation and delivering meltwater. The SGL-driven ablation effect was most pronounced in the South-West basin of the GrIS, where the peak lake area in July accounted for 44.9 % of the total GrIS-wide lake area. In contrast, the lowest magnitude (4.2 %) was observed in the South-East basin, despite similarly strong ablation in this region. Among all the generated SGL occurrence grids, peak SGL areas in certain grids (∼14 % of the total) were observed in May or September, rather than exclusively during the typical high-ablation months of June to August, reflecting regional and elevation-dependent variations. Grids further from the ice sheet margin generally showed peak SGL areas later in the melt season, which is evident in the western part of the GrIS. Monthly SGL peak areas shift dramatically from 253.18 ± 123.94 km2 to 5084.90 ± 1043.26 km2, with the lowest in May 2018 and the highest in August 2021.

 Flash droughts cause serious damage to ecosystems and human societies due to their rapid onset and intensification. Their fast changes pose significant challenge to existing drought warning and monitoring systems. Although previous studies have focused on meteorological, ecological and soil moisture indicators for assessing flash droughts, an effective quantitative indicator capturing the direct manifestation of flash droughts—specifically, the rapid decline in terrestrial water storage (TWS)—remains unavailable. To address this gap, we propose a pentad-scale hydrological flash drought identification framework based on a daily-scale reconstructed TWS anomaly dataset derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations. We further analyze global flash drought hotspot regions, their spatiotemporal evolution, and key drivers from 1979 to 2018. Our findings reveal that, on a spatial scale, flash drought hotspots are primarily concentrated in humid and semi-humid climate zones. On a temporal scale, the impact of flash droughts has intensified in regions such as Northern Europe, Northern Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, whereas the Amazon, East Africa, and West Africa exhibit a decreasing trend. In other study regions, no significant changes in flash drought conditions are observed. At the global scale, energy-related factors (including temperature and solar radiation) contribute significantly more to flash drought development than water-related factors (such as precipitation). Additionally, approximately 48 % of flash droughts worldwide evolve into long-term droughts, with this transition occurring primarily during the vegetation growing season in humid regions. The hydrological flash drought identification framework proposed in this study effectively addresses gaps in existing monitoring systems, providing a crucial scientific basis for drought early warning and disaster mitigation."

 Heterogeneous environments and low Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR) pose a challenge for Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD). Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constrained by the global view. Transformer with quadratic computational complexity struggles for local feature refinement. Inspired by the quad-directional scanning State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity for long-range modeling, this research reconceptualizes the spatial and structural information of small targets in IR images. Multi-granularity features and long-range dependency of small targets are considered simultaneously. Specifically, we tailor a nested structure with cross-fertilization of global and local information. Each layer of the top-level pyramid network embeds a tiny well-configured contextual pyramid block to extract fine-grained features of small targets. The following Mamba module restructures the feature maps to derive coarse-grained features of “visual sentences”. The fusion of contextual information and local feature achieves precise localization of small targets. Furthermore, we propose the Asymmetric Convolution (AConv) for substituting the Depthwise Convolution (DWConv) in the Visual State Space (VSS) module and the regular convolution in each lateral connection of the nested pyramid network to alleviate the parameters and computation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms 12 recent baseline methods on two public datasets."

 Thermal infrared hyperspectral images (TIR-HSIs) provide unique spectral insights that are often unattainable with visible imagery, making them invaluable for applications such as land cover classification and geological mapping. However, the high spectral redundancy in TIR-HSIs often leads to increased computational complexity and potential performance degradation. To address this issue, this paper proposed an unsupervised temperature–emissivity–driven band selection method (TEBS) for TIR-HSIs classification, which integrated a structured state-space model (SSM) and a gated attention mechanism (GAM). Specifically, a feature extraction (FE) module is firstly designed to separate land surface temperature (LST) and land surface emissivity (LSE) information, incorporating superpixel segmentation to extract multi-scale LST features. Subsequently, a weight computation (WC) module, leveraging SSM and GAM, is developed to generate robust band weights by sequentially leveraging multi-scale LST features. Finally, a band evaluation (BE) module is employed to assess the band selection results and optimize the model parameters. Experimental comparisons conducted on two datasets using four classic classifiers show that TEBS framework outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in classification accuracy. These results underscore the potential of TEBS to advance land cover classification in thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging.

 The 31st Summer Edition of the FISU World University Games took place in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China from July 27nd to August 8th, 2023. To ensure optimal air quality during this event, a series of control measures were implemented, providing a unique opportunity to assess the impact of reduced anthropogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions on ozone (O3) mitigation. A comprehensive field campaign was conducted at an urban supersite in Chengdu, spanning both the pre-control period (July 1st −21st) and the control period (July 22nd-August 8th). To reflect the emission features of primary pollutants, the photochemical initial concentrations of VOCs (In-VOCs) were calculated and their sources were identified by applying receptor model. During the control period, the average mixing ratio of In-VOCs (comprising 57 species) was 22.7 ppbv, reflecting a 17 % reduction compared to the pre-control period. Source apportionment identified four key anthropogenic VOC sources: industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, gasoline evaporation, and solvent use. The largest reduction was observed in solvent utilization (48.9 %). The observation-based box model, configured with the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM-OBM), was used to quantify the impact of VOC reductions from each source on O3 concentrations. The most significant reduction in daily maximum 8-h O3 concentrations was achieved by controlling traffic sources (vehicle and gasoline evaporation emissions), resulting in a decrease of 11.9 μg/m3, followed by reductions from industrial emissions (8.9 μg/m3) and solvent utilization (2.4 μg/m3). Our results indicate that a modest, scientifically justified reduction in VOC levels can significantly contribute to O3 pollution mitigation, providing valuable insights for summer urban air quality management."

 A comprehensive field campaign was conducted during the wet season of 2019 in urban Dongguan, South China, to investigate the evolution of particle number concentrations during rainfall events. Size-resolved particle number concentrations (4.7–10,000 nm), classified into nucleation mode (NUC), Aitken mode (AIT), accumulation mode (ACC), and coarse mode (CM), were measured to estimate below-cloud scavenging (BCS) coefficients (estimated Λ) from 53 rainfall events by comparing particle number concentrations before and during rainfall for each event. Among these, 36 % (19 events) exhibited positive estimated Λ values across all modes, 19 % (10 events) showed negative values, and 45 % (24 events) displayed mixed positive/negative values. Estimated Λ values for CM particles were consistent with theoretical estimates, while those for NUC, AIT, and ACC particles were approximately an order of magnitude higher. During the 19 rainfall events with positive estimated Λ values, a weak positive correlation was observed between rainfall intensity (RI) and the average estimated Λ across all modes, while stronger correlations emerged during rainfall events coinciding with new particle formation (NPF), where RI and estimated Λ were highly correlated (R2 = 0.93, p < 0.05). In these cases, estimated Λ for NUC, AIT, and ACC particles were at least 1.7 times those in other rainfall events. This enhancement is largely attributed to rainfall interfering with concurrent NPF processes, which reduces the formation and growth of new particles and amplifies the decline in particle number concentrations. As a result, Λ values derived from observational data may be inflated, independent of actual wet scavenging. Additional non-rainfall factors, such as air mass transport and local emissions, also contributed to the variability. These findings underscore that non-rainfall influences, by altering ambient particle concentrations, can significantly bias Λ estimation and offer new insights into interpreting apparent BCS behavior."

 Bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogues (BPs) are widely used in the chemical industry and increasingly detected in various environmental media. However, their occurrence and behavior in airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) remain poorly understood, particularly in industrially intensive regions. This study investigates the concentrations, compositional profiles, seasonal variations, and potential sources of thirteen bisphenols in PM2.5 collected from a large chemical industrial park in Shanghai. Results revealed that BPA, bisphenol F (BPF) were the predominant congeners, accounting for over 90 % of thirteen bisphenols, with concentrations of Σ13BPs ranging from 15.705 to 6211.201 pg/m3 (mean: 957.781 pg/m3). Higher concentrations were observed during the cool season, coinciding with lower temperature, lower wind speed, and higher atmospheric pressure, which favored the accumulation of bisphenols on fine particles. Spearman correlation and principal component analysis indicated that BPA, BPF, bisphenol B (BPB), and bisphenol E (BPE) likely originate from shared industrial activities, primarily polycarbonate production, and were significantly associated with combustion-related pollutants (NOx, CO). The 24-h backward trajectory and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analyses indicate combined contributions from local emissions and regional transport. However, the influence of long-range transport remains uncertain and warrants further investigation. Human exposure assessment based on estimated daily intake (EDI) and hazard quotient (HQ) showed low risk through inhalation for both adults and children. Overall, this study highlights the need for attention to airborne bisphenols emissions from local sources and provides a scientific basis for environmental control and health risk management in chemical industrial zones."

 Precipitation spatial patterns significantly impact regional water resource management, agricultural production, and socioeconomic development. While conventional methods typically explain less than 80 % of total precipitation variability due to challenges in analyzing spatially heterogeneous rainfall data, this study introduces a novel dual-criterion framework integrating Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) with Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) to enhance pattern identification. Using meteorological station data (1951–2024) from the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB), we identified 11 homogeneous sub-regions and six dominant precipitation patterns explaining a notably high 85.1 % of total variance: basin-wide coherent (34.7 %), north-south dipole (18.6 %), western dominant (11.3 %), lower reaches dominant (8.0 %), and two tripole patterns (12.4 % combined). The basin-wide pattern, occurring most frequently (31 years), dominated historical catastrophic floods (1954, 1998, 2020). Circulation analysis revealed a distinctive tripole structure in the 500 hPa geopotential height field driving the basin-wide pattern, while anticyclonic circulation anomalies characterized the north-south dipole pattern. The positive phase of the basin-wide pattern features enhanced southwesterly moisture transport from tropical sources with peak convergence of −2.29 × 10−6 kg/(m 2·s) over the central Yangtze region, mechanistically explaining basin-wide precipitation increases. Wavelet coherence analysis uncovered a critical temporal shift in ENSO's influence on basin-wide precipitation from short (2–4 years) to long (8–12 years) periods since the 1960s, fundamentally transforming teleconnection impacts on major flood events. Concurrently, PDO maintains a robust decadal-scale relationship with lower Yangtze precipitation patterns throughout the entire study period, offering potential for reliable long-term predictability. These findings provide a scientific foundation for improving seasonal precipitation forecasting and regional water resource management under changing climate conditions."

 A warming climate is driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events are increasingly occurring in rapid succession or simultaneously, creating compound effects that amplify their overall impact. Among these, Drought-Wet Abrupt Alternation events (DWAA) - rapid transitions between drought conditions and extreme wet periods (characterized by heavy precipitation) - are becoming more frequent. Northern China, spanning multiple climate subregions and strongly influenced by various monsoon systems, serves as a typical example of such events. Using 40 years of historical meteorological data (1980–2020), we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of DWAA across Northern China and identified the North China Plain and the Loess Plateau as primary hotspots. In comparison, drought-to-wet transitions (DTW) posed a higher risk level to Northern China than wet-to-drought transitions (WTD), characterized by generally more intense transition magnitudes and a more pronounced increasing trend in frequency over the past 40 years. Crucially, the Loess Plateau and northern North China Plain emerged as areas most severely affected, identified as high-frequency zones (recording eight or more events per decade) and high-risk areas for both DTW and WTD. Over 50 % of DTW occurred in summer, while nearly 80 % of WTD took place in summer and autumn—periods crucial for both agricultural productivity and ecosystem health. This seasonal concentration is driven by climate warming, which has intensified the concentration of precipitation and, in turn, heightened the severity of dry-wet transitions. Our research underscores the urgent need for improved disaster risk management, water resource planning, and climate adaptation strategies in these vulnerable regions."

 Characterizing vertical profiles of in-situ particle properties is relevant because being only based on the surface or column-integrated measurements cannot unambiguously conclude the radiative impact on aerosol. Vertical profiles of in-situ aerosol properties on-board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were measured above El Arenosillo (37.1 N, −6.7 W) in the southwest of Spain during four flight missions. Measured properties included particle number size distribution, total particle concentration and multiwavelength absorption coefficient up to 3100 m during cold season (February 4, 2022 and December 11, 2023) and warm season (September 20, 2023 and April 2, 2024). The heterogeneity of particle properties has been shown around two types of events: a mineral particle event of desert origin during cold season and a new particle formation event during warm season. During cold season, a comparison between the flight missions with and without desert dust episodes shows that mineral particles decrease the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height. This behavior is probably related to absorber particles aloft atmosphere, which traps solar radiation and heat up the upper layer of the atmosphere and deteriorates the vertical dispersion. In the literature, this effect is called as ‘dome effect’. During warm season, new particle formation was observed above PBL. This event could be related to the presence of precursor gases in the residual layer, and enhanced by a low concentration of pre-existing particles. The characteristic parameter during the observed event was the fine-to-total particle volume concentration ratio close to zero. These observations highlight the necessity to establish a long-term multi-temporal monitoring of vertical profiles for atmospheric parameters onboard UAV systems and to integrate in Earth observations networks. For example, radiative forcing is usually estimated from surface data, but the heterogeneity in the vertical profiles of atmospheric particles properties, which are used to the forcing quantification, is a result of inaccuracies."

We show here that the elasmobranch immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) isotypes—IgM, IgW, and IgNAR—are linked near the αδ T cell receptor (TCRαδ) locus. This linkage presages the emergence of the osteichthyan IgH translocon arrangement and clarifies the relationship between IgH and TCRδs. Recently, we reportedUrIg, a nonrearranging, elasmobranch major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked AgR gene. Here, we describe a nonrearrangingUrIgparalogue,UrIg2, linked to this IgM/IgNAR/IgW/TCRαδ gene cluster in an AgR complex (AgRC). UrIg2 amino-terminal domains make homodimers where the C2-C3 structure resembles IgGFc. A relative of the UrIg2 V domain exon was invaded by the RAG transposon, revealing the genesis of the adaptive immune system. Our data indicate that an ancestral chromosome encoded an AgR precursor, undergoing RAG-mediated rearrangement after genome-wide duplication on one chromosome and retaining nonrearranging relics in the MHC and AgRC."
