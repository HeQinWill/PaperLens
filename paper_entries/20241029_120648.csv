10.1088/1748-9326/ad8245,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文主要关注东亚地区近几十年来暖季陆地和海洋的干燥趋势。文章利用1980年至2022年的降水-蒸发(P-E)数据，结合水分收支分解和数值实验，分析了东亚地区特别是中国东南部和黄海区域的干旱化现象。研究结果表明，中国东南部地区的干旱化主要由动力过程驱动，特别是与风变化相关的湿度辐散，这与印度-太平洋暖池变暖引起的异常下沉运动有关；而黄海及邻近海域的干旱化则受热力学湿度平流的影响，全球变暖导致的西北太平洋边缘海SST升高和中国内陆地区SST降低，驱动着干空气通过背景西南风从中国内陆输送至黄海。该研究使用了遥感技术和卫星观测数据，对大气成分（湿度、温度等）和环流变化进行分析，揭示了东亚地区陆地和海洋干旱化趋势的成因及其差异，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['precipitation', 'evaporation', 'moisture budget', 'sea surface temperature (SST)', 'wind changes', 'atmospheric circulation', 'satellite observations', 'remote sensing', 'drying trend', 'climate change']",Go-Un Kim;Hyoeun Oh;Jin-Yong Jeong,Drying trend in land and sea in East Asia during the warm season over the past four decades,"The East Asian region is typically characterized by warm and humid conditions from late spring to summer. However, in recent decades, this region has experienced an increase in severe drying conditions, deviating from historical climatological patterns. This study investigated the precipitation − evaporation (P − E) trends across land and sea regions in East Asia (EA) during the extended summer season (April–September) from 1980 to 2022, and the key physical processes driving these trends through moisture budget decomposition and numerical experiments. The results reveal pronounced drying trends in southeastern China and the Yellow Sea and parts of the Korea Strait and Korean Peninsula over the past 43 years. The underlying physical processes driving these drying conditions differ between land and sea in EA. In southeastern China, the drying is driven by dynamic processes, particularly moisture divergence related to wind changes. This is linked to anomalous strengthening of descending motion due to the Indo-Pacific warm pool warming induced by both anthropogenic global warming and natural Pacific Decadal Oscillation-like sea surface temperature (SST) patterns. Conversely, drying in the Yellow Sea and adjacent areas is influenced by thermodynamic moisture advection. The altered humidity distribution due to global warming-induced SST patterns, which are higher over the Northwest Pacific marginal sea and lower in inland China, drives dry air transport from inland China to the Yellow Sea via background southwesterly wind. These findings enhance our understanding of the drying trend and their distinct processes in EA’s land and sea areas during the extended summer."

Given the emphasis of the Sustainable Development Goals on the importance of affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy, we critically assess how local innovations can address the unique challenges of regions characterized by informality and low purchasing power and where existing grid-based electricity supply is weak. Through case studies, we highlight successful initiatives in expanding energy services access, including product bundling, pay-as-you-go financial models, leveraging existing supply chains, and securing strong funding support. Our findings underscore the importance of local ownership, contextual knowledge, and the adaptation of innovations to specific socio-economic and cultural conditions. By comparing the case studies, we identify common strategies that can contribute to the effectiveness of local innovations in improving energy access and sustainability that can inform efforts to replicate and scale up such initiatives. We conclude by identifying common elements contributing to the success of these cases and their significance, focusing on those crucial for achieving speed, scale, and impact."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8506,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是如何利用遥感技术和神经网络模型估算全球尺度的蒸腾量。蒸腾量是陆地生态系统水分循环的重要组成部分，准确估算它对气候变化研究和水资源管理至关重要。该研究提出了一种结合Priestley-Taylor模型和人工神经网络的新方法，利用全球可获取的遥感数据（如土壤湿度、水汽压差、风速等）和来自SAPFLUXNET的全球树液流动测量网络数据，避免了对气孔导度的参数化，提高了蒸腾量估算的精度。该方法减少了对地面观测数据的依赖，并通过将实测数据放大到更大尺度，解决了蒸腾量产品稀缺的问题。研究结果表明，该模型在不同森林生态系统中具有较高的估算精度，并且蒸腾量在全球ET中的平均贡献率为55.2%。总的来说，这项研究利用了遥感技术，并结合机器学习方法，在全球尺度上对蒸腾量进行了更准确的估算，这对于理解陆气相互作用和气候变化具有重要意义。,"['Evapotranspiration', 'Transpiration', 'Remote sensing', 'Satellite observations', 'Land surface temperature', 'Soil moisture', 'Vapor pressure deficit', 'Wind speed', 'Global scale']",Marco Hannemann;Almudena García-García;Rafael Poyatos;Miguel D Mahecha;Jian Peng,Estimating transpiration globally by integrating the Priestley-Taylor model with neural networks,"Transpiration (T), the component of evapotranspiration (ET) controlled by the vegetation, dominates terrestrial ET in many ecosystems; however, estimating it accurately, especially at the global scale, remains a considerable challenge. Existing approaches mostly rely on the relationship between T and photosynthesis, but untangling this relationship is difficult and leads to diverging T estimates. Limited in-situ measurements and the inability to directly measure transpiration from space further complicate the reliable assessment of this crucial process in the terrestrial water cycle. Here, we developed a new hybrid Priestley–Taylor (PT) model combined with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using globally available remote sensing and reanalysis data of soil moisture, vapor pressure deficit and windspeed. We also take advantage of the newly released global sap flow measurement network SAPFLUXNET. In the proposed approach, we avoid the parameterization of stomatal conductance by training the ANN on the PT-Coefficient α, obtained by inverting the PT equation. The results showed that our model framework can estimate T in different forest ecosystems based on few predictors. By utilizing forcings from independent datasets, we eliminate the reliance on in-situ measurements for predicting T. Through upscaling actual observations to a larger scale, this model framework helps alleviate the scarcity of T products. Intercomparison of T with ET partitioning methods based on eddy covariance data, shows high performances (KGE of 0.69 in Europe and 0.60 in North America), slightly improving estimates compared to other models. Analysis of contribution of T to ET across 100 FLUXNET sites result in a global mean of 55.2%. We believe that modelling T independent from the carbon cycle can support our understanding of land-atmosphere feedbacks and climate extremes in future research."

Meanwhile, many populations remain malnourished due to insufficient or unhealthy diets. Increasingly, dietary shifts are proposed as a means to address both environmental and health concerns. We have a limited understanding of how dietary shifts could alter where food is produced and consumed and how these changes would affect the distribution of environmental pressures both globally and across different groups of people. Here we combine new food flow data linking producing to consuming country with environmental pressures to estimate how a global shift to each of four diets (Indian, EAT-Lancet, Mediterranean, and mean Food Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs)) could affect environmental pressures at the global, country income group, and country level. Globally, cumulative pressures decrease under the Indian, EAT-Lancet, and Mediterranean scenarios and increase under FBDGs. On average, low income countries increase their cumulative consumption and production pressures while high income countries decrease their consumption pressures, and typically decrease their production pressures. Increases in low income countries are likely due to the nutritional inadequacy of current diets and the corresponding increases in consumption quantities with a shift to our diet scenarios. Despite these increases, we believe that three out four of our simulated dietary shifts can be seen as a net benefit by decreasing global pressures while low income countries increase pressures to adequately feed their populations. Additionally, considering principles of fairness applied, some nations are more responsible for causing historical environmental pressures and should shoulder more of the change. To facilitate more equitable shifts in global diets, resources, capacity, and knowledge sharing of sustainable agricultural practices are critical to minimize the increases in pressures that low income countries would incur to adequately feed their populations."

We use Bayesian multi-level modeling to meta-analyse 831 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity in sites subject to land-use driven deforestation (for example, plantations or logged forest) versus undisturbed sites (control sites). After controlling for hierarchical dependencies, we show that biodiversity is a fifth lower in sites with these land-use driven deforestation (95% credible interval = 16%–28%, mean = 22%). This reduction was greater when forest losses were of high-intensity (34% reduction in biodiversity) compared to low-intensity (18% reduction), and effects were consistent across biogeographic regions and taxa. Oil-palm plantations led to the greatest reduction in biodiversity (39%, CI 27%–48%), and agroforests the least (24%, CI 10%–37%). We also find that biodiversity was reduced by 26% (CI 4%–42%) in secondary forest sites compared to undisturbed control sites, but biodiversity was the same in intermediate or mature-aged secondary forest compared to control sites (although species composition was potentially altered). Overall, our study provides a new line of evidence of the substantial detrimental impacts of land-use driven deforestation and particular types of land-use on the biodiversity of Southeast Asia."

Tree planting, commonly advocated for carbon offset, threatens grassland biodiversity and may induce positive radiative forcing (warming) by lowering albedo. Before making decisions about land-use changes in grasslands, an understanding of the fine-scale albedo of grassy versus woody vegetation is needed. Existing satellite-based albedo products offer global coverage with temporally fine, but spatially coarse, resolution, whereas fine-scale in situ grassland albedo data are sparse. We examined the hypotheses that albedo varies seasonally between grass type patches, between shrub and grass patches, and with grazing at the patch scale. Using a tripod-mounted albedometer, we quantified albedo of seven distinct grassland patches in South Africa’s eastern Karoo during early and late dormancy and growing seasons. Patches included intensely-grazed grazing lawn (Cynodon dactylon), grazed and less-grazed red tussock grass (Themeda triandra), grazed and less-grazed white tussock grass (Eragrostis lehmanniana), shrub (Pentzia incana) encroached grass, and bare ground. Season influenced albedo in all patches and, additionally, we found strong differences for the same period between years due to varying rainfall and temperature patterns. For grass-dominated patches, albedo differences were most pronounced during early dormancy, likely due to an effect of grass inflorescences. Albedo of intensely-grazed grazing lawns was consistently higher than other patches, except during early dormancy when white tussock grass albedo was equally high. We found no albedo difference between grazed and less-grazed tussock patches of either red or white grass. Shrub-encroached patches exhibited consistently lower albedo than other patches. Our findings underscore the nuanced relationship between grassland patches and albedo, with shrub encroachment, proposed afforestation, and certain grasses possibly increasing warming potential through reduced albedo. As climate initiatives extend into grasslands, understanding these patterns is essential for climate change mitigation and grassland conservation."

Daellenbach;Robin Modini;Jay G. Slowik;Abhishek Upadhyay;Petros N. Vasilakos;David Bell;Kees de Hoogh;Andre S. H. Prevot,Opinion: How will advances in aerosol science inform our understanding of the health impacts of outdoor particulate pollution?,"This opinion paper explores how advances in aerosol science inform our understanding of the health impacts of outdoor particulate pollution. We advocate for a shift in the way we target PM pollution, focusing on the most harmful anthropogenic emissions. We highlight key observations, modelling developments, and emission measurements needed to achieve this shift. 
 Air pollution, characterized by high levels of particulate matter (PM), poses the greatest environmental threat to human health, causing an estimated 7 million deaths annually and accounting for 5 % of the global gross domestic product (GDP). While the health impacts of PM are influenced by the toxicity of its individual chemical constituents, the mortality burden of PM is solely based on its total mass concentration. This is because of a lack of large-scale, high-resolution data on PM chemical composition, needed for epidemiological assessments. Identifying which PM constituents are harmful to health has been the “holy grail” of atmospheric science since the landmark 1993 study on six US cities established a definitive link between PM and mortality. Ever since, atmospheric scientists have focused on understanding aerosol composition, emission sources, and formation pathways, while longitudinal epidemiological studies have required individual-level exposure data, employing land use regression models for the prediction of exposures at fine resolutions. In this opinion article, we argue that the time has come to shift the focus towards incorporating PM chemical composition into epidemiological health assessments, laying the foundation for the development of new regulatory metrics. This shift will enable the creation of targeted guidelines and subsequent regulations, prioritizing mitigation efforts against the most harmful anthropogenic emissions. Central to this shift is the availability of global, long-term, high-resolution data on PM chemical composition that are obtained through field observations and modelling outputs. In the article, we underscore key milestones within aerosol science that have been integral for advancing this foundational shift. Specifically, we examine emerging modelling tools for estimating exposure to individual PM components, present the type of ambient observations needed for model developments, identify key gaps in our fundamental understanding of emissions and their atmospheric transformation, and propose advancing cross-disciplinary collaboration between aerosol scientists and epidemiologists to understand the health impacts of individual PM components. We contend that aerosol science has now reached a pivotal moment in elucidating the differential health impacts of PM components, representing a first step towards their incorporation into air quality guidelines."

Furthermore, the study examines different physical mechanisms of forming three distinct types of LLJs. 
 In this study, we utilized a high-resolution (4 km) convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulation spanning a 13-year period (2000–2013) to investigate the climatological features of low-level jets (LLJs) over North America. The 4 km simulation enabled us to represent the effects of orography and the underlying surface on the boundary layer winds better. Focusing on the continental US and the adjacent border regions of Canada and Mexico, this study not only identified several well-known large-scale LLJs, such as the southerly Great Plains LLJ and the summer northerly California coastal LLJ, but also the winter Quebec northerly LLJ which received less focus before. All these LLJs reach their peak in the nighttime in the diurnal cycle. Thus, the different thermal and dynamic mechanisms forming these three significant LLJs are investigated in this paper. Inertial oscillation theory dominates in the Great Plain LLJ, and the California coastal LLJ is formed by the baroclinic theory, whereas the Quebec LLJ is associated with both theories. Moreover, the high-resolution simulation revealed climatic characteristics of weaker and smaller-scale LLJs or low-level wind maxima in regions with complex terrains, such as the northerly LLJs in the foothill regions of the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians during the winter. This study provides valuable insights into the climatological features of LLJs in North America, and the high-resolution simulation offers a more detailed understanding of LLJ behavior near complex terrains and other smaller-scale features."

We apply the particle size distribution from Parsivel to a T-matrix backscattering simulation and compare with ZHH from MRR. Bulk density and bulk water fractions are derived from comparing simulated and calculated ZHH. Retrieved bulk density is validated by comparing snowfall rate measurements from Pluvio and the Precipitation Imaging Package. Snowfall rate consistency confirms the algorithm. 
 A new method is developed to derive the bulk density and bulk water fraction of a population of particles from collocated measurements from the Micro-Rain Radar (MRR) and Particle Size and Velocity disdrometer (Parsivel). A rigorous particle-scattering simulation, namely the T-matrix method, is applied to Parsivel's particle size distribution data to calculate the reflectivity (ZHH). The possible combinations of the particle's ice, air, and water are derived to compare them with the MRR-measured ZHH. The combination of the minimum water fraction and maximum ice fraction subsequently determines the bulk density (ρbulk). The proposed method is applied to the data collected from the International Collaborative Experiments for Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic winter games (ICE-POP 2018) projects and its pre-campaign. The estimated ρbulk was examined independently by a comparison of the liquid-equivalent snowfall rate (SR) of collocated Pluvio devices. The bias values are adequately low (SR: −0.25–0.06 mm h−1). The retrieved bulk density also shows good consistency with collocated Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) retrievals. The results indicate the capability of the proposed algorithm to derive reliable ρbulk, leveraging the compact and easily deployable designs of MRR and Parsivel. The derived bulk density of the two warm–low cases (28 February and 7 March 2018) shares a similar transition as the systems were decaying. The higher bulk density and bulk water fraction were found in the coastal sites (BKC and GWU have a median value of ρbulk and are 0.05 to 0.12 g cm−3), typically accompanied by higher liquid-water constituents (mean values of the top 5 % bulk water fraction are 0.07 to 0.45) than the inland sites (YPO and MHS have a median value of ρbulk and are 0.06 to 0.10, and mean values of the top 5 % bulk water fraction are 0.001 to 0.008) during such synoptic conditions."

These episodes are caused by low-to-high dipole meteorology during hemispheric anomalies characterized by subtropical anticyclones shifting to higher latitudes, anomalous low pressures beyond the tropics and amplified Rossby waves. Extreme dust events occur in a paradoxical context of a multidecadal decrease in dust emissions, a topic that requires further investigation. 
 Unprecedented extreme Saharan dust (duxt) events have recently expanded northward from subtropical NW Africa to the Atlantic and Europe, with severe impacts on the Canary Islands, mainland Spain and continental Portugal. These six historic duxt episodes occurred on 3–5 and 22–29 February 2020, 15–21 February 2021, 14–17 January 2022, 29 January–1 February 2022, and 14–20 March 2022. We analyzed data of 341 governmental air quality monitoring stations (AQMSs) in Spain (330) and Portugal (11), where PM10 and PM2.5 are measured with European norm (EN) standards, and found that during duxt events PM10 concentrations are underestimated due to technical limitations of some PM10 monitors meaning that they can not properly measure extremely high concentrations. We assessed the consistency of PM10 and PM2.5 data and reconstructed 1690 PM10 (1 h average) data points of 48 and 7 AQMSs in Spain and Portugal, respectively, by using our novel “duxt-r” method. During duxt events, 1 h average PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were within the range 1000–6000 µg m−3 and 400–1200 µg m−3, respectively. The intense winds leading to massive dust plumes occurred within meteorological dipoles formed by a blocking anticyclone over western Europe and a cutoff low located to the southwest, near the Canary Islands and Cape Verde, or into the Sahara. These cyclones reached this region via two main paths: by deviating southward from the Atlantic mid-latitude westerly circulation or northward from the tropical belt. The analysis of the 2000–2022 PM10 and PM2.5 time series shows that these events have no precedent in this region. The 22–29 February 2020 event led to (24 h average) PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations within the range 600–1840 and 200–404 µg m−3, respectively, being the most intense dust episode ever recorded on the Canary Islands. The 14–20 March 2022 event led to (24 h average) PM10 and PM2.5 values within the range 500–3070 and 100–690 µg m−3 in southeastern Spain, 200–1000 and 60–260 µg m−3 in central Spain, 150–500 and 75–130 µg m−3 in the northern regions of mainland Spain, and within the ranges 200–650 and 30–70 µg m−3 in continental Portugal, respectively, being the most intense dust episode ever recorded in these regions. All duxt events occurred during meteorological anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere characterized by subtropical anticyclones shifting to higher latitudes, anomalous low pressure  expanding beyond the tropical belt and amplified mid-latitude Rossby waves. New studies have reported on recent record-breaking PM10 and PM2.5 episodes linked to dipole-induced extreme dust events from North Africa and Asia in a paradoxical context of a multidecadal decrease in dust emissions, a topic that requires further investigation."

Two methods of source apportionment of absorption were tested and compared showing traffic as the main contributor to absorption in the urban area, in addition to biomass and open waste burning. 
 Black carbon (BC) is a major component of submicron particulate matter (PM), with significant health and climate impacts. Many cities in emerging countries lack comprehensive knowledge about BC emissions and exposure levels. This study investigates BC concentration levels, identifies its emission sources, and characterizes the optical properties of BC at urban background sites of the two largest high-altitude Bolivian cities: La Paz (LP) (3600 m above sea level) and El Alto (EA) (4050 m a.s.l.), where atmospheric oxygen levels and intense radiation may affect BC production. The study relies on concurrent measurements of equivalent black carbon (eBC), elemental carbon (EC), and refractory black carbon (rBC) and their comparison with analogous data collected at the nearby Chacaltaya Global Atmosphere Watch Station (5240 m a.s.l). The performance of two independent source apportionment techniques was compared: a bilinear model and a least-squares multilinear regression (MLR). Maximum eBC concentrations were observed during the local dry season (LP: eBC = 1.5 ± 1.6 µg m−3; EA: 1.9±2.0 µg m−3). While eBC concentrations are lower at the mountain station, daily transport from urban areas is evident. Average mass absorption cross sections of 6.6–8.2 m2 g−1 were found in the urban area at 637 nm.

This novel previously overlooked source of atmospheric HONO and NOx may be an important contribution to the global nitrogen cycle and affects atmospheric oxidizing capacity and climate change. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2) are important atmospheric pollutants and key intermediates in the global nitrogen cycle, but their sources and formation mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of soluble iron (Fe3+) on the photochemical behavior of a widely used neonicotinoid (NN) insecticide, nitenpyram (NPM), in the aqueous phase. The yields of HONO and NOx increased significantly when NPM solution was irradiated in the presence of iron ions (Fe3+). We propose that the enhanced HONO and NO2 emissions from the photodegradation of NPM in the presence of iron ions result from the redox cycle between Fe3+ and Fe2+ and the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) by electron transfer between the excited triplet state of NPM and molecular oxygen (O2). Using the laboratory-derived parameterization based on kinetic data and gridded downward solar radiation, we estimate that the photochemistry of NPM induced by Fe3+ releases 0.50 and 0.77 Tg N yr−1 of NOx and HONO, respectively, into the atmosphere.This study suggests a novel source of HONO and NOx during daytime and potentially helps to narrow the gap between field observations and model outcomes of HONO in the atmosphere. The suggested photochemistry of NPM can be an important contribution to the global nitrogen cycle affecting the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and climate change."

We demonstrate and quantify the benefit of combining low- and high-frequency microwave radiometers to improve humidity profiling and IWV estimates by comparing the retrieved quantities to single-instrument retrievals and reference datasets (radiosondes). 
 In the central Arctic, high-quality water vapour observations are sparse due to the low density of meteorological stations and uncertainties in satellite remote sensing. Different reanalyses also disagree on the amount of water vapour in the central Arctic. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of the Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition provides comprehensive observations that are suitable for evaluating satellite products and reanalyses. Radiosonde observations provide high-quality water vapour estimates with a high vertical but a low temporal resolution. Observations from the microwave radiometers (MWRs) on board the research vessel Polarstern complement these observations through high temporal resolution. In this study, we demonstrate the high accuracy of the combination of the two MWRs HATPRO (Humidity and Temperature Profiler) and MiRAC-P (Microwave Radiometer for Arctic Clouds – Passive). For this purpose, we developed new retrievals of integrated water vapour (IWV) and profiles of specific humidity and temperature using a neural network approach, including observations from both HATPRO and MiRAC-P to utilize their different water vapour sensitivity. The retrievals were trained with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) and synthetic MWR observations simulated with the Passive and Active Microwave radiative TRAnsfer tool (PAMTRA). We applied the retrievals to synthetic and real observations and evaluated them with ERA5 and radiosondes launched during MOSAiC, respectively. To assess the benefit of the combination of HATPRO and MiRAC-P compared to single MWR retrievals, we compared the errors with respect to MOSAiC radiosondes and computed the vertical information content of the specific humidity profiles. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of IWV was reduced by up to 15 %. Specific humidity biases and RMSE were reduced by up to 75 % and 50 %, respectively. The vertical information content of specific humidity could be increased from 1.7 to 2.4 degrees of freedom. We also computed relative humidity from the retrieved temperature and specific humidity profiles and found that RMSE was reduced from 45 % to 15 %. Finally, we show a case study demonstrating the enhanced humidity profiling capabilities compared to the standard HATPRO-based retrievals. The vertical resolution of the retrieved specific humidity profiles is still low compared to radiosondes, but the case study revealed the potential to resolve major humidity inversions. To what degree the MWR combination detects humidity inversions, also compared to satellites and reanalyses, will be part of future work."

Results show that nocturnal low-level jets occur most frequently in spring and intensify in summer, significantly increasing turbulence and shear intensity near the ground level, especially during the night. Cloud cover raises the MLH by around 100 m during the night due to the greenhouse effect and decreases it by up to 200 m in the afternoon by obstructing solar radiation. 
 Understanding the dynamics of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is crucial for comprehending land-atmosphere interactions. This study utilizes three years of Doppler wind lidar measurements from June 2019 to June 2022 to investigate PBL dynamics over Hefei, a city in the Western Yangtze River Delta, China. We focus on the seasonal and diurnal variations in key characteristics, such as wind profiles, shear intensity, turbulent mixing, low-level jets (LLJs), and mixing layer heights (MLH). Results show that horizontal wind speeds accelerated more rapidly above 3 km, with the predominant westerly winds (270°±15°) in all seasons. The vertical depth of high wind zone (> 8 m s-1) during the day is found generally deeper than at night, particularly in winter. In Hefei, LLJs primarily form at sunset and dissipate by noon, typically at altitudes between 0.5 and 0.6 km throughout the year, except in July. LLJ occurrences are most frequent in spring (31.7 %), followed by summer (24.7 %), autumn (22.3 %), and winter (21.3 %). Summer LLJs are most intensified, extending up to 1.5 km. The larger wind gradient below the jets significantly enhances turbulence and shear intensity near the ground at night. The seasonal average MLH peaks between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., reaching approximately 1.2 km in spring and summer. Cloud cover raises MLH by about 100 m at night but decreases it by 200 m at the afternoon peak.

However, the XCO2 retrieved from satellite sensors is spatially discontinuous and has long time intervals. In this study, we generated a spatiotemporal continuous XCO2 dataset based on machine learning models, which has high temporal and spatial resolution. This dataset can be used for in-depth research on carbon sources and sinks. 
 Carbon dioxide (CO2), as a major greenhouse gas, is one of the important causes of global warming. In recent years, the atmospheric CO2 concentration in China has been increasing year by year. Satellite observation is the main means of obtaining atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, the current onboard sensors used for measuring atmospheric CO2 have a narrow observation range and cannot obtain spatiotemporal continuous atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Therefore, this paper proposes a daily full-coverage XCO2 dataset generation method based on the DSC-DF-LGB (Deep Separable Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Forest concatenated with LightGBM) model to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of atmospheric CO2 in China. The DSC-DF-LGB model was established to train the mapping relationship between OCO-2 XCO2 retrieval and related variables (reanalysis XCO2, vegetation parameters, human factors, elevation, and meteorological parameters). The model was used to generate a daily 0.1° full-coverage XCO2 dataset for China from 2015 to 2020. The cross validation (CV) result indicates that the model has strong performance in estimating XCO2, with R2 and RMSE of 0.9633 and 0.9761 ppm. The TCCON independent site validation result indicates that the estimated XCO2 has high consistency with in-situ measurements, with R2 and RMSE of 0.8786 and 1.5452 ppm. The full-coverage and high-resolution XCO2 dataset can provide data support for research on carbon sources and sinks.

To address this gap, we develop a global 1 km spatially continuous UCP dataset (GloUCP), which provides superior spatial coverage and higher accuracy in capturing urban morphology across diverse regions. It has great potential to support further advancements in urban climate modeling and related applications. 
 The complexities of urban climate and environmental challenges have garnered significant attention in the 21st century. Numerical simulations, offering high spatiotemporal resolution meteorological data, are essential tools in meteorological research and atmospheric science. Accurate representation of urban morphology parameters is crucial for enhancing the precision of these simulations in urban areas. Despite the availability of urban canopy parameter (UCP) data for 44 major cities in the United States and 60 in China for the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, a comprehensive global dataset representing urban morphology remains absent. This study addresses this gap by leveraging existing global three-dimensional vector data of buildings, including footprints and heights, to compile a global 1 km spatially continuous UCP (GloUCP) dataset for the WRF model. Our findings indicate that GloUCP not only surpasses existing datasets in accuracy but also provides superior spatial coverage. In key urban agglomerations such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in China, GloUCP offers detailed and reliable urban morphological information that closely aligns with reference datasets, outperforming other available sources. Similarly, in U.S. cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, GloUCP consistently achieves lower RMSE values and higher correlation coefficients, demonstrating its robustness in modeling diverse urban environments. Furthermore, GloUCP’s capability to effectively capture the vertical distribution of buildings, particularly in high-rise areas, highlights its utility in urban climate modeling and related applications. As UCPs are pivotal in regulating atmospheric responses to urbanization, the availability of this globally consistent urban description is a crucial prerequisite for advancing model development and informing climate-sensitive urban planning policies.

This dataset improves our understanding of fCO2 in the under-sampled Brazilian coastal region, and provides a unique insight into the complex biogeochemistry of the Amazon River-Ocean continuum. 
 The air-sea CO2 flux in the coastal ocean is a key component of the global carbon budget. However, due to the scarcity of data, the many sources and sinks of carbon and their complex interactions in these waters remain poorly understood. In 2021, the Tara schooner collected 14,000 km of CO2 fugacity (fCO2) measurements along the coast of South America, including in the Amazon River-Ocean continuum (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13790065, Olivier et al., 2024a). The interactions between the Amazon River and its oceanic plume are complex, and under a combined influence of many processes such as tides and bathymetry. Downstream of the Amazon River plume, the fCO2 is low compared with that of the atmosphere, reaching a minimum of 42 μatm. In the river, fCO2 reaches up to 3000 μatm. South of the estuary, the waters of the North Brazil Current have a fCO2 exceeding 400 μatm. Along the Brazil Current, fCO2 is around 400 μatm and decreases, as does temperature, as the schooner sails away from the equator. Nevertheless, in all the data collected in this coastal environment, salinity varies greatly, and therefore describes best the variability of fCO2. Despite the strong variability and uncertainties in the data, comparison with discrete samples of other carbonate parameters shows that the mean differences (2 µatm) are within the range of uncertainties related to the chemical formula used for the comparison. This data set helps to fill the gap in our knowledge of the behavior of fCO2 in the under-sampled region of the Brazilian coast."

 A multiscale modeling ensemble chain has been assembled as a first step towards an air quality analysis and forecasting (AQF) system for Latin America. Two global and three regional models were tested and compared in retrospective mode over a shared domain (120–28° W, 60° S–30° N) for the months of January and July 2015. The objective of this experiment was to understand their performance and characterize their errors. Observations from local air quality monitoring networks in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador and Peru were used for model evaluation. The models generally agreed with observations in large cities such as Mexico City and São Paulo, whereas representing smaller urban areas, such as Bogotá and Santiago, was more challenging. For instance, in Santiago during wintertime, the simulations showed large discrepancies with observations. No single model demonstrated superior performance over others or among pollutants and sites available. In general, ozone and NO2 exhibited the lowest bias and errors, especially in São Paulo and Mexico City. For SO2, the bias and error were close to 200 %, except for Bogotá. The ensemble, created from the median value of all models, was evaluated as well. In some cases, the ensemble outperformed the individual models and mitigated extreme over- or underestimation. However, more research is needed before concluding that the ensemble is the path for an AQF system in Latin America.

Herein, we investigated the electron transfer and pollutant oxidation mechanisms of atomic-level exposed Ag atom clusters (AgAC) loaded on specifically crafted nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC). The AgAC triggered a direct electron transfer (DET) between the terminal oxygen (Oα) of surface-activated peroxodisulfate and the electron-donating substituents-containing contaminants (EDTO–DET), rendering it 11–38 times higher degradation rate than the reported carbon-supported metal catalysts system with various single-atom active centers. Heterocyclic substituents and electron-donating groups were more conducive to degradation via the EDTO–DET system, while contaminants with high electron-absorbing capacity preferred the radical pathway.

Direct monitoring in sewers can be expensive or biased due to access limitations and internal heterogeneity of sewer networks. Fortunately, since methane is almost exclusively biogenic in sewers, we demonstrate in this study that the methanogenic potential can be estimated using known sewer microbiome data. By combining data mining techniques and bioinformatics databases, we developed the first data-driven method to analyze methanogenic potentials using a data set containing 633 observations of 53 variables obtained from literature mining. The methanogenic potential in the sewer sediment was around 250–870% higher than that in the wet biofilm on the pipe and sewage water. Additionally, k-means clustering and principal component analysis linked higher methane emission rates (9.72 ± 51.3 kgCO2 eq m–3 d–1) with smaller pipe size, higher water level, and higher potentials of sulfate reduction in the wetted pipe biofilm. These findings exhibit the possibility of connecting microbiome data with biogenic greenhouse gases, further offering insights into new approaches for understanding greenhouse gas emissions from understudied sources."

Recently, elevated levels of reactive chlorine species during bleach cleaning and disinfection have been reported to increase indoor oxidative capacity. However, incomplete knowledge of the indoor transformation of limonene, especially the missing chlorine chemistry, poses a barrier to evaluating the environmental implications associated with the concurrent use of cleaning agents and disinfectants. Here, we investigated the reaction mechanisms of chlorinated limonene peroxy radicals (Cl-lim-RO2•), key intermediates in determining the chlorine chemistry of limonene, and toxicity of transformation products (TPs) using quantum chemical calculations and toxicology modeling. The results indicate that Cl-lim-RO2• undergoes a concerted autoxidation process modulated by RO2• and alkoxy radicals (RO•), particularly emphasizing the importance of RO• isomerization. Following this generalized autoxidation mechanism, Cl-lim-RO2• can produce low-volatility precursors of secondary organic aerosols. Toxicological findings further indicate that the majority of TPs exhibit increased respiratory toxicity, mutagenicity, and eye/skin irritation compared to limonene, presenting an occupational hazard for indoor occupants. The proposed near-explicit reaction mechanism of chlorine-initiated limonene significantly enhances our current understanding of both RO2• and RO• chemistry while also highlighting the health risks associated with the concurrent use of cleaning agents and disinfectants."

Functional gene-targeted sequencing revealed the dominance (>70%) of group-6 soluble di-iron monooxygenases (SDIMOs) in both consortia, crucial for concurrent propane consumption and co-oxidation of dioxane and CAHs.

We observed patchy-distributed Zn and Cd hotspots in all soils, including at a native concentration in the nonspiked soil. With increasing Zn and Cd spikes, these metals preferentially colocated with Fe-dominated mineral phases, whereas with the highest spike, Zn and Cd increasingly colocated with clay minerals and soil organic matter. Soil extracts suggested that large proportions of spiked Zn and Cd were tightly bound to the colocated phases.

However, when candidate ILs fall into the extrapolation zone of ML models, predictions may become unreliable, leading to poor decision-making. In this study, we introduce a “representation uncertainty” (RU) approach to quantify prediction uncertainty by employing four IL representations: molecular fingerprint, molecular descriptor, molecular image, and molecular graph. We develop four types of ML models based on these representations and calculate RU as the standard deviation of predictions across these models. Compared to traditional model uncertainty (MU), which is based on hyperparameter variations within a single representation, RU outperforms MU in identifying unreliable predictions across four IL property data sets: viscosity, toxicity, refractive index, and CO2 absorption capacity. Furthermore, we develop ensemble models from the four types of models, which show superior predictive performance compared with that of individual models. Using the RU approach, we screened 1420 ILs and identified 37 promising candidates with low viscosity, low toxicity, and high CO2 absorption capacity. The predictive performance of our ensemble model, along with the effectiveness of the RU-based approach, was experimentally validated by testing the CO2 absorption capacity of 14 ILs.

Millet;Paul B. Shepson;Allison L. Steiner,Vertical Variations in Biogenic Organic Nitrates at Two Temperate Forest Sites,"Forest canopies emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), which contribute to the formation of regional ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. In the presence of NOx, atmospheric oxidation of BVOC can produce organic nitrates that are an important component of SOA and act as a reservoir for NOx, regulating local and regional atmospheric chemistry. Prior field observations of organic nitrates have focused on the above-canopy observations, yet there is little understanding of the vertical profiles of SOA and organic nitrates relative to the forest canopy emission sources. Here we contrast organic nitrate formation at two mixed deciduous forested ecosystems (the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) and the Southern Aerosol Oxidant Study (SOAS) site in Alabama) with distinct differences in BVOC and NOx to understand the formation of organic nitrates in and above a forest canopy. Gas-phase BVOC and NOx concentrations are higher at SOAS than at UMBS, but the isoprene/monoterpene ratio is similar. We use a one-dimensional canopy model (Forest Canopy-Atmosphere Transfer Model version 2.0) to investigate the vertical profiles of isoprene- and monoterpene-derived secondary organic aerosol formation (iSOA and MT-SOA, respectively), with a focus on the aerosol organic nitrate. Simulated total iSOA shows similar temporal patterns as above-canopy observations at both sites, with the dominant fraction (50–80%) formed by isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX). Within the canopy, the organic nitrate component of iSOA (iNIT-SOA) remains relatively small (10–20%) with slightly higher concentrations simulated at SOAS. The simulated iSOA composition at the two sites is similar, with four carbon (C4) nitrates dominating in the canopy and tetrafunctional nitrates dominating in the boundary layer. MT-SOA has different diurnal cycles at the two sites and is about 2–4 times greater at SOAS than UMBS, although the model underpredicts the observed top-of-canopy MT-SOA at both sites. The simulated organic nitrate component of the total MT-SOA (mNIT-SOA) is about 40% of the MT-SOA at SOAS and 20% at UMBS. Sensitivity analyses suggest that iNIT-SOA is highly sensitive to NO levels, while mNIT-SOA is more sensitive to dry deposition of preexisting organic particles. Overall, the 1D modeling suggests that organic nitrate aerosols are greater in and above the canopy near BVOC sources with a decrease in fractional contribution to total biogenic SOA with height in the boundary layer. Finally, organic nitrate aerosol composition can vary between similar ecosystems depending on the regional speciated BVOC emissions."

There were no significant differences in positive, in-room ion concentrations between any weeks; however, negative, in-room ion concentrations were significantly lower when the ionizer was on with constant fan speed. To account for day-to-day variability in total bacteria concentrations, related to occupancy and other factors, we examined the ratio of CFUs to 16S rRNA gene copies (CFU gc–1) and found no significant differences whether the ionizer was on or off.

The results revealed the highest bacterial diversity in sandstorm air and the lowest bacterial diversity in haze air, with markedly different community structures. Moreover,  substantial dissimilarity was detected between the communities of total bacteria and active bacteria within the sandstorm air, with less abundant bacteria dominating the active bacterial population. Selective pressure played a pivotal role in shaping the composition of active bacteria during sandstorms and the total bacterial community in hazy air, thereby enabling potential interactions between airborne microorganisms and chemical components.

This study investigated the long-term effects of continuous cattle grazing, stocking rates, and fertilization regimens on methane (CH4) emissions, soil microbial communities, and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in Bermudagrass pastures in East Texas, USA. Pastures were subjected to high or low stocking rates for over 50 years, with further subdivision based on fertilization: nitrogen-based fertilizer application or no fertilizer but with the growth of annual clover. Seasonal soil cores (0–60 cm) were collected, and laboratory microcosm incubation studies revealed unexpectedly high in vitro CH4 emissions in surface soils, particularly in the top 0–5 cm soil layer, reaching up to 300 nmol of CH4 mL–1. Higher CH4 emissions and methanogen abundance, along with lower SOC stocks, were observed in pastures subjected to high stocking rates compared to those with low stocking rates and in clover pastures compared to those with N-fertilized ryegrass. On the contrary, in low-stocked, N-fertilized annual ryegrass pastures, methanogen abundance was lowest, CH4 emissions were negligible, and SOC stocks were highest. Furthermore, animal excreta deposition significantly contributed to increased CH4 emissions. Prokaryotic and potential methanotrophic taxa, as compared to fungi, exhibited greater responsiveness to N-fertilization than to cattle stocking treatments with higher levels of methanotrophs observed in pastures subjected to high stocking rates and clover growth.

Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored the mechanisms underlying BHPF activation using a CYP450 compound I (Cpd I) model, identifying several plausible products. Compared with the higher energy barriers associated with phenyl ring addition reactions, the formation of a phenoxyl-type radical through phenolic hydrogen atom abstraction, followed by OH rebound or radical coupling, represents an energetically favorable pathway.

Meanwhile, as an essential element, Cu has been implicated in key processes associated with aging, raising questions about its role in age-related health issues. This study delves into the mechanisms behind the copper imbalance during aging. By analyzing blood copper concentrations of healthy individuals (including data from healthy subjects (26 ≤ age ≤ 90, n = 62) and publicly available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (18 ≤ age < 80, n = 1624)) and employing C57BL/6N male mice models (n = 22), we reveal a consistent age-related increase in copper levels, particularly in plasma. Utilizing stable copper isotopic analysis, copper-associated protein analysis, and metabolomic analysis, we trace the sources of Cu imbalance associated with aging. Our findings reveal that aged mice had a higher copper concentrations and an enrichment of light copper isotope (63Cu) in plasma compared to controls. Additionally, copper reductases and copper transporters are upregulated in the intestine tract, associated with the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways. We suggest that aged mice have an abnormally high copper intake requirement, probably due to deregulated nutrient sensing, leading to increased expression levels of copper reductases and copper transporters for extra copper absorption in the intestines. This research provides a copper-centric perspective on the connection between deregulated nutrient sensing and aging, thus shedding light on the aspect of aging and copper overexposure."

Therefore, it is highly desired to distinguish between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules for the early prevention and treatment of lung cancer. Currently, histopathological examination is the gold standard for classifying pulmonary nodules, which is invasive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. This study proposes a metallomics approach through synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) with a simplified one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) to distinguish pulmonary nodules by using serum samples. SRXRF spectra of serum samples were obtained and preliminarily analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequently, machine learning algorithms (MLs) and 1DCNN were applied to develop classification models. Both MLs and 1DCNN based on full-channel spectra could distinguish patients with benign and malignant pulmonary nodules, but the highest accuracy rate of 96.7% was achieved when using 1DCNN. In addition, it was found that characteristic elements in serum from patients with malignant nodules were different from those in benign nodules, which can serve as the fingerprint metallome profile. The simplified model based on characteristic elements resulted in good performance of sensitivity and F1-score > 91.30%, G-mean, MCC and Kappa > 85.59%, and accuracy = 94.34%. In summary, metallomic classification of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using serum samples can be achieved through 1DCNN-boosted SRXRF, which is easy to handle and much less invasive compared to histopathological examination."

NOR degradation did not significantly affect cytotoxicity of NOR against BV2, A549, HepG2, and Vero E6 cells. Compared with that of NOR, mutagenicity and median lethal concentration of P1–P8 in fathead minnow were increased, and bioaccumulation factor and oral median lethal dose of P1–P8 in rats were decreased. Molecular docking was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of DNA gyrase A (gyrA) on NOR-DPs to determine the molecular-level mechanism and establish the structure–activity relationship. Results indicated that the most common amino acid residues were Ile13, Ser27, Val28, Gly31, Asp36, Arg46, Arg47, Asp157, and Gly340; hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions played key roles in the inhibitory effect.

Recent research has demonstrated that prenatal exposure to F-53B results in synaptic damage in weaning mice. However, the mechanism underpinning F-53B-triggered synaptic damage during fetal development remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of the protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway, a crucial signaling mechanism known as “synaptic switch”, in the early neurotoxicity of F-53B exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Here, C57BL/6 fetal mice were subjected to exposure to F-53B (0, 4, and 40 μg/L) from gestation days (GD) 0 to 14 to evaluate nerve injury prior to delivery. HT22 neurons exposed to F-53B (0, 0.016, 0.08, 0.4, 2, and 10 μmol/L) for 24 h were utilized to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that F-53B significantly increased the fluorescence intensity of Nestin (a neural stem cell marker) in the fetal brain hippocampus (GD14). Subsequently, we found that F-53B downregulated the expression of synaptic plasticity markers (SYP, GAP43, and BDNF) in the fetal brain and HT22 neurons. Further molecular docking analysis revealed that F-53B fits into the ligand-binding pockets of PKA and CREB1. Results showed that F-53B inhibited the translocation of PKA protein from the cytoplasm to the neuronal nuclei and reduced the levels of PKA, CREB1, p-PKA(α/β/γ)-Thr197, and p-CREB1-S133 in the nucleus. Furthermore, the expression of synaptic plasticity markers altered by F-53B could be reversed by a PKA agonist and was intensified by a PKA antagonist. In summary, our findings suggest that intrauterine exposure to F-53B can weaken the expression of synaptic plasticity markers in the fetal brain, with this neurotoxicity being mediated by the cytoplasmic retention of PKA."

These infections are highly prevalent and are often linked to waterborne diseases. Due to the absence of regulations for monitoring these protozoa at the discharge points of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the effluents reaching surface waters contribute to waterborne transmission. This underscores the significance of the removal capacities of WWTPs in reducing the spread of these infectious parasites. Therefore, this study examined five different types of WWTPs in Ankara, Turkey, over a year to assess their capacities to remove E. histolytica and B. hominis. The seasonal abundances of genes specific to these protozoa in both the influents and effluents of each WWTP were measured using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The reduction in the number of protozoan rDNA copies between the influent and effluent samples was evaluated as the removal capacity, expressed in log10 reduction (LRV) values. The results elucidated that the removal of E. histolytica and B. hominis was highly affected by the process used. Membrane bioreactor systems displayed the highest removal capacity with LRV > 3. Therefore, discharges of WWTPs with other processes could need further monitoring to minimize the potential risk for public health."

Compared with conventional birth cohorts, the inclusion of a maternity cohort allows greater scope for research and places an emphasis on maternal health. In particular, it allows us to focus on pregnant women with a history of pregnancy-related illnesses and those planning to have a second or third child. There are currently many pressing issues in perinatal health, including the risk associations between exogenous together with endogenous factors and the occurrence of perinatal abnormalities, pregnancy complications, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is crucial to explore the interaction between environmental exposures and genetic factors affecting perinatal health if we are to improve it.

We searched three databases up to January 31, 2024, for eligible original studies to ultimately include 37 studies from eight countries with a total of 28 911 participants. DEHP exposure was evaluated with urinary metabolites. Since the main types, production sites, blood concentrations, and functions of reproductive hormones differ between men and women, we reported the combined effect values by gender. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, subfertility status, and the national sociodemographic index (SDI) level. Furthermore, the effect of maternal exposure during pregnancy on children’s reproductive hormone levels was analyzed separately. Overall, in general, in men, DEHP was positively correlated with sex hormone binding-globulin (SHBG) and adversely correlated with total testosterone (TT), free androgen index (FAI), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Results indicated that among men of reproductive age, DEHP exposure was associated with more significant hormonal suppression in infertile men compared with fertile men. Notably, age subgroup analysis among women revealed that postmenopausal women were more vulnerable to DEHP, which was related to lower TT and estradiol (E2). However, this study did not observe a significant association between prenatal DEHP metabolites and reproductive hormone levels in children.

Significant lethal and sublethal effects (e.g., neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and metabolic and oxidative stress) were observed in fish and clams irrespective of economic gradients. Notably, ecological effects differed significantly between water and sediment phases within the same region. Target (98 contaminants) and suspect screening (942 contaminants) revealed regional-specific characteristics. Ecological risk assessments using a weight of evidence approach demonstrated that both water and sediment in the PRB were at moderate to high risk, as was the sediment in the less developed PYB.

The BKMR model revealed an inverted U-shaped association of PAEs with TT3 and FT3 and a nonlinear association with TSH, TT4, and FT4. Structural equation modeling revealed that MMP, MIBP, MBP, MEHP, MOP, MBZP, and MEOHP contributed to a net reduction in neonatal birth weight of 32 g through the TT3, FT3, TT4, and FT4 pathways. The findings suggest that exposure to PAEs during pregnancy leads to a reduction in neonatal birth weight, possibly due to the involvement of maternal thyroid hormones as mediators.

We revealed that SiNPs caused pulmonary interstitial injury in rats by histopathological examination and pulmonary hydroxyproline determination. Further, a single-cell RNA-Seq via screening 10 457 cells in the rat lungs disclosed cell-specific responses to SiNPs and cell-to-cell interactions within the alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts from rat lungs. These disturbed responses were principally related to the dysregulation of protein homeostasis (proteostasis), accompanied by an inflammatory response in macrophages, cell death in epithelial, proliferation, and extracellular matrix deposition in fibroblast. These cell-specific responses may serve a synergistic role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary interstitial disease triggered by SiNPs. In particular, the analyses of gene interaction networks and gene–disease associations filtered out heat shock proteins (Hsps) family genes crucial to the observed pulmonary lesions caused by SiNPs. Of note, both GEO database analysis and our experiments’ validation indicated that Hsps, especially Hspd1, may be a key contributor to pulmonary interstitial injury, possibly through triggering oxidative stress, immune response, and disrupting protein homeostasis. Taken together, our study provides insights into pulmonary toxic effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of SiNPs from a single-cell perspective."

The electron energy spectrogram of these arcs exhibited “inverted‐V” structures, indicating the existence of quasi‐static parallel electric fields. Concurrently, long‐period ULF signals were detected on the ground, suggesting the arrival of Alfvén waves. These observations are represented by a kinetic simulation using realistic observational inputs, showing consistency with the theory regarding the generation of the “inverted‐V” structure by long‐period Alfvén waves. This study builds a previously unestablished connection among HSJ, ULF wave, and aurora, and provides a mechanism for generation of discrete auroral arcs near local noon, which may reveal the underlying mechanism behind a specific auroral activity commonly observed near local noon as shown in the paper."

Edmonds,Topographic Roughness as an Emergent Property of Geomorphic Processes and Events,"Earth's terrestrial surfaces commonly exhibit topographic roughness at the scale of meters to tens of meters. In soil‐ and sediment‐mantled settings topographic roughness may be framed as a competition between roughening and smoothing processes. In many cases, roughening processes may be specific eco‐hydro‐geomorphic events like shrub deaths, tree uprooting, river avulsions, or impact craters. The smoothing processes are all geomorphic processes that operate at smaller scales and tend to drive a diffusive evolution of the surface. In this article, we present a generalized theory that explains topographic roughness as an emergent property of geomorphic systems (semi‐arid plains, forests, alluvial fans, heavily bombarded surfaces) that are periodically shocked by an addition of roughness which subsequently decays due to the action of all small scale, creep‐like processes. We demonstrate theory for the examples listed above, but also illustrate that there is a continuum of topographic forms that the roughening process may take on so that the theory is broadly applicable. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our theory applies to any geomorphic feature that can be described as a pit or mound, pit‐mound couplet, or mound‐pit‐mound complex."

Complex relations between topographic and environmental attributes characterizing landslide susceptibility at local scales are not transferrable across areas without landslide data. Existing maps with multiple susceptibility classifications under‐represent landslide potential in moderate and gently sloping terrain. We leverage an extensive landslide database (N = 613,724), a high‐resolution digital elevation model (10‐m), and high‐performance computing resources, to develop a new nationwide susceptibility map for the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. We calculate four alternative linear and nonlinear thresholds of topographic slope and relief using an objective split‐sample calibration. We down‐sample our results to a 90‐m grid to account for uncertainty in the digital elevation model and landslide position, and evaluate these thresholds' ability to differentiate areas of greater susceptibility. The less conservative nonlinear model optimally balances our priorities of capturing observed landslides (99%) while minimizing area covered by susceptible terrain (43%). Independent evaluation with four statewide landslide inventories (N = 172,367) reinforces our model selection but highlights spatially variable performance. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to susceptibility classification using the concentration of landslide‐prone terrain within each down‐sampled grid. While landslides are possible within any cells containing susceptible terrain, those with the highest concentration capture the majority of observed landslides. Our new map characterizes landside susceptibility more consistently than prior models; our transparent classification approach also provides flexibility for accommodating different tolerances in risk reduction measures."

This study demonstrates that a spectral analysis of the resolved high‐resolution sub‐cloud flow features allows for a robust identification of dominant length scales and the quantification of their growth rates during the transition. Furthermore, it is shown that temperature, moisture, and horizontal winds develop multiple length scales with the largest ones growing up to several kilometers in magnitude.

10.1029/2024EF004430,True,Earth's Future,这篇论文研究了1901年到2020年全球热浪的频率、强度及其驱动因素。研究发现，热浪的频率和强度都急剧增加，其空间分布不均，强度波动性增强，并且由于干旱加剧，四个关键热浪指标的基尼系数增大。虽然干旱地区热浪发生频率更高，但潮湿地区的累积热量更大，导致这些地区的热浪风险更高。过去三十年（1991-2020年）的全球热浪风险比20世纪初（1901-1930年）增加了近五倍。GeoDetector分析表明，在干旱和潮湿地区，帕尔默干旱严重性指数（PDSI）和向下地表短波辐射（Srad）的贡献最大。相对湿度（RH）、风速（WS）、土壤湿度（SM）和归一化植被指数（NDVI）在潮湿地区的贡献也很显著，但在干旱地区则小得多。复合分析表明，热浪风险异常高的年份对应于500百帕位势高度和地表气压的正异常。下沉气流抑制云的形成，导致大气温度升高，这可能增加了热浪发生的风险。该研究强调了迫切需要解决气候变化日益恶化的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星观测数据（例如地表温度、辐射、植被指数等）来分析热浪，并利用这些数据研究气候变化的影响。,"['Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Surface shortwave radiation', 'Geopotential height', 'Surface pressure', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Climate change', 'Heatwave risk assessment', 'Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)', 'Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)', 'Air temperature', 'Soil moisture']",Chuan Wang;Zhi Li;Yaning Chen;Yupeng Li;Lin Ouyang;Jianyu Zhu;Fan Sun;Shiran Song;Hongwei Li,Changes in Global Heatwave Risk and Its Drivers Over One Century,"
Heatwaves represent a significant and growing threat to natural ecosystems and socio‐economic structures, making heatwave risk mitigation and prevention an important area of research. In exploring heatwave frequency and intensity from 1901 to 2020, the present study finds a sharp increase in both. The study also finds that the spatial distribution of heatwaves is unequal, the volatility of intensity characteristics has become more prominent over time, and the Gini coefficients of four key heatwave indictors have become larger due to increasing dryness. Although heatwaves occur more frequently in drylands, there is greater cumulative heat in humid areas, resulting in a higher heatwave risk in those areas. The global heatwave risk over the past three decades (1991–2020) has increased nearly five‐fold compared to the early 20th century (1901–1930). Furthermore, GeoDetector analysis indicates that the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and downward surface shortwave radiation (Srad) contributing the most in drylands and humid areas (0.29 and 0.41, respectively). The contribution of relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), soil moisture (SM), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is also significant in humid areas, but is much smaller in drylands. Composite analysis shows that the years with anomalously high heatwave risk correspond to positive anomalies of 500hPa geopotential height and surface pressure. The inhibition of cloud formation due to sinking air and the resulting increase in temperature in the atmosphere may be increasing the risk of heatwave occurrence. This study emphasizes the urgent need to address worsening climate change impacts."

It connects the surface water balance with surface energy fluxes, making its accurate representation vital for climate projections. However, global climate models (GCMs) struggle with ET representation due to resolution limitations and simplified depictions of soil, plant, and atmosphere interactions. Simulated future changes in ET are uncertain, and the role of driving processes remain unclear. Here, we explore the utility of a simple and interpretable method to disentangle these varying drivers. We investigate the sensitivity of JJA ET to different atmospheric variables through simple linear models predicting ET from atmospheric variables only. The model consistently yields good results across GCMs or forcing scenarios. We find that GCMs have shown strong decreases and subsequent increases in ET over the historical period, related to changes in net surface radiation. For future climate projections, decreases in water availability compete with higher available surface radiation, making future projections uncertain. Single forcing GCM realizations show that historical ET trends in densely populated regions have been more influenced by aerosol emissions than greenhouse gases. Finally, we investigate which atmospheric variables explain most short‐term (year‐to‐year) and long‐term (decadal) changes. While water availability may be the most important driver of short‐term variability, for certain regions, radiation trends dominate long‐term forcing. This paper leverages a simple approach to provide a comprehensive and understandable view into recent and future changes in ET, reconciling the evidence provided by more complex case studies."

 Since 2020, there has been unprecedented global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in wild bird populations with spillover into a variety of mammalian species and sporadically humans1. In March 2024, clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) virus was first detected in dairy cattle in the U.S., with subsequent detection in numerous states2, leading to over a dozen confirmed human cases3,4. In this study, we employed the ferret model, a well-characterized species that permits concurrent investigation of viral pathogenicity and transmissibility5 in the evaluation of A/Texas/37/2024 (TX/37) A(H5N1) virus isolated from a dairy farm worker in Texas6. Here, we show that the virus has a remarkable ability for robust systemic infection in ferrets, leading to high levels of virus shedding and spread to naïve contacts. Ferrets inoculated with TX/37 rapidly exhibited a severe and fatal infection, characterized by viremia and extrapulmonary spread. The virus efficiently transmitted in a direct contact setting and was capable of indirect transmission via fomites. Airborne transmission was corroborated by the detection of infectious virus shed into the air by infected animals, albeit at lower levels compared to the highly transmissible human seasonal and swine-origin H1 subtype strains. Our results show that despite maintaining an avian-like receptor binding specificity, TX/37 displays heightened virulence, transmissibility, and airborne shedding relative to other clade 2.3.4.4b virus isolated prior to the 2024 cattle outbreaks7, underscoring the need for continued public health vigilance."

 The outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype (HPAI H5N1) in dairy cows in the US has so far resulted in spillover infections of at least thirteen farm workers1-3, who presented with mild respiratory symptoms or conjunctivitis, and one individual with no known animal exposure who was hospitalized but recovered3,4. Here, we characterized A/Texas/37/2024 (huTX37-H5N1), a virus isolated from the eyes of an infected farm worker who developed conjunctivitis5. huTX37-H5N1 replicated efficiently in primary human alveolar epithelial cells, but less efficiently in corneal epithelial cells. Despite causing mild disease in the infected worker, huTX37-H5N1 was lethal in mice and ferrets and spread systemically with high titres in respiratory and non-respiratory organs. Importantly, in four independent experiments in ferrets, huTX37-H5N1 transmitted via respiratory droplets in 17%–33% of transmission pairs and five of six exposed ferrets that became infected died. PB2-631L (encoded by bovine isolates), promoted influenza polymerase activity in human cells, suggesting a role in mammalian adaptation like that of PB2-627K (encoded by huTX37-H5N1). Additionally, bovine HPAI H5N1 viruses were found to be susceptible to polymerase inhibitors both in vitro and in mice. Thus, HPAI H5N1 virus derived from dairy cattle transmits by respiratory droplets in mammals without prior adaptation and causes lethal disease in animal models."

 Geomorphological and mineralogical evidence is consistent with aqueous activity on ancient Mars, yet explaining the presence of substantial liquid water on early Mars remains challenging. Another fluid, liquid CO2, was probably present during Martian history, at least in the subsurface, and could even have been stable at the surface under a sufficiently dense CO2-rich early atmosphere. Liquid CO2 flows have been proposed as an alternative to water to explain morphological features, but it is widely accepted that water is the fluid responsible for mineral alteration. Interestingly, however, experimental research on geologic sequestration on Earth has revealed a surprising degree of chemical reactivity between CO2 fluid and minerals if the fluid is water-saturated, as it would probably have been on Mars. The resulting alteration products — carbonates, phyllosilicates and possibly sulfates — are consistent with minerals found on Mars today. We therefore propose that the formation of some of the aqueous mineral alteration observed on the Martian surface may have been mediated by liquid CO2.

 Bottom trawling represents the most widespread anthropogenic physical disturbance to seafloor sediments on continental shelves. While trawling-induced changes to benthic ecology have been widely recognized, the impacts on long-term organic carbon storage in marine sediments remains uncertain. Here we combined datasets of sediment and bottom trawling for a heavily trawled region, the North Sea, to explore their potential mutual dependency. A pattern emerges when comparing the surface sediment organic carbon-to-mud ratio with the trawling intensity represented by the multi-year averaged swept area ratio. The organic carbon-to-mud ratio exhibits a systematic response to trawling where the swept area ratio is larger than 1 yr−1. Three-dimensional physical–biogeochemical simulation results suggest that the observed pattern is attributed to the correlated dynamics of mud and organic carbon during transport and redeposition in response to trawling. Both gain and loss of sedimentary organic carbon may occur in weakly trawled areas, whereas a net reduction of sedimentary organic carbon is found in intensely trawled grounds. Cessation of trawling allows restoration of sedimentary carbon stock and benthic biomass, but their recovery occurs at different timescales. Our results point out a need for management of intensely trawled grounds to enhance the CO2 sequestration capacity in shelf seas. Intensive bottom trawling causes a long-term reduction of organic carbon stored in seafloor sediments, suggesting a need for more effective management, according to observations and biogeochemical modelling."

 Transition metal-catalyzed addition of organometallics to aryl(alkyl)alkynes has been well known to proceed with the regioselectivity in forming a carbon–carbon bond at the alkyl-substituted carbon (β-addition). Herein, the reverse regiochemistry with high selectivity in giving 1,1-diarylalkenes (α-addition) was realized in the reaction of arylboronic acids with aryl(alkyl)alkynes by use of a rhodium catalyst coordinated with a chiral diene ligand, whereas the arylation of the same alkynes proceeded with the usual regioselectivity (β-addition) in the presence of a rhodium/DM-BINAP catalyst. The regioselectivity can be switched by the choice of ligands on the rhodium catalysts. This reverse regioselectivity also enabled the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of phoenix-like axially chiral alkylidene dihydroanthracenes with high enantioselectivity through an α-addition/1,4-migration/cyclization sequence.

 Non-Abelian Thouless pumps are periodically driven systems designed by the non-Abelian holonomy principle, in which quantized transport of degenerate eigenstates emerges, exhibiting noncommutative features such that the outcome depends on the pumping sequence. The study of non-Abelian Thouless pump is currently restricted to 1D systems, while extending it to higher-dimensional systems will not only provide effective means to probe non-Abelian physics in high-dimensional topological systems, but also expand the dimension and type of associated non-Abelian geometric phase matrix for potential applications.

 In eukaryotes, topologically associating domains (TADs) organize the genome into functional compartments. While TAD-like structures are common in mammals and many plants, they are challenging to detect in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis PDS5 proteins play a negative role in TAD-like domain formation. Through Hi-C analysis, we show that mutations in PDS5 genes lead to the widespread emergence of enhanced TAD-like domains throughout the Arabidopsis genome, excluding pericentromeric regions. These domains exhibit increased chromatin insulation and enhanced chromatin interactions, without significant changes in gene expression or histone modifications. Our results suggest that PDS5 proteins are key regulators of genome architecture, influencing 3D chromatin organization independently of transcriptional activity.

 Mass spectrometry-based methods can provide a global expression profile and structural readout of proteins in complex systems. Preserving the in vivo conformation of proteins in their innate state is challenging during proteomic experiments. Here, we introduce a whole animal in vivo protein footprinting method using perfusion of reagents to add dimethyl labels to exposed lysine residues on intact proteins which provides information about protein conformation.

We identify structural changes of co-expressed proteins and link the communities of these proteins to their biological functions. Our findings show that structural alterations of proteins precede changes in expression, thereby demonstrating the value of in vivo protein conformation measurement. Our method represents a strategy for untangling mechanisms of proteostasis dysfunction caused by protein misfolding.

 Engineering proteins with desired functions and biochemical properties is pivotal for biotechnology and drug discovery. While computational methods based on evolutionary information are reducing the experimental burden by designing targeted libraries of functional variants, they still have a low success rate when the desired protein has few or very remote homologous sequences. Here we propose an autoregressive model, called Temporal Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (TDVAE), which exploits the mathematical properties of the Dirichlet distribution and temporal convolution to efficiently learn high-order information from a functionally related, possibly remotely similar, set of sequences. TDVAE is highly accurate in predicting the effects of amino acid mutations, while being significantly 90% smaller than the other state-of-the-art models. We then use TDVAE to design variants of the human alpha galactosidase enzymes as potential treatment for Fabry disease. Our model builds a library of diverse variants which retain sequence, biochemical and structural properties of the wildtype protein, suggesting they could be suitable for enzyme replacement therapy. Taken together, our results show the importance of accurate sequence modelling and the potential of autoregressive models as protein engineering and analysis tools.

 Although cropland expansion continues in many regions, substantial areas of cropland have been abandoned in recent decades as a result of demographic, socioeconomic and technological changes. Variation among species and habitats and limited information on the nature and duration of abandonment have resulted in controversy over how abandonment affects biodiversity. Here, we use annual land-cover maps to estimate habitat changes for 1,322 bird and mammal species at 11 sites across four continents for 1987–2017. We find that most bird (62.7%) and mammal species (77.7%) gain habitat because of cropland abandonment, yet even more would have benefited (74.2% and 86.3%, respectively) if recultivation had not occurred. Furthermore, many birds (32.2%) and mammals (27.8%) experienced net habitat loss after accounting for agricultural conversion that occurred before or alongside abandonment. While cropland abandonment represents an important conservation opportunity, limiting recultivation and reducing additional habitat loss are essential if abandonment is to contribute to biodiversity conservation.

 Climatic change is dramatically altering phenology but generalities regarding tempo and mode of response remain limited. Here we present a general model framework incorporating spring temperature, velocity of spring warming, and species’ thermal requirements for predicting phenological response to warming. A key prediction of this framework is that species active earlier in the season and located in warmer regions where spring temperature velocity is lowest show strongest sensitivity to climatic change and greatest advancement in response to warming. We test this prediction using plant phenology datasets collected in the 1850s and 2010s. Our results strikingly confirm model predictions, showing that while temperature sensitivity is higher in regions with low temperature velocity, the greatest realized change in phenological onset is northern areas where warming rates have been fastest. Our framework offers enhanced utility for predicting phenological sensitivity and responsiveness in temperate regions and across multiple plant species and potentially other groups.

 The rapid increase in Urban Construction Sites (UCSs) due to urbanization has become a global trend. UCSs are crucial for timely tracking of urban expansion and renewal progress, understanding settlement environments and human activities, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 11. However, distinguishing UCSs from other land covers remains challenging, whether using spatial texture and spectral features or time-series characteristics. There is an urgent need for a universally applicable UCS mapping method at the national scale, a gap that current research has yet to fill. In this study, we proposed a method combining geospatial data with remote sensing data for national UCS mapping under medium spatial resolution. Additionally, we combine the UCS mapping results with SDGSAT-1 GLI data to evaluate the utilization status of new construction areas, thereby supporting SDG 11.3. The results showed that, for six representative cities, the F1-Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC) for exposed UCS mapping results ranged from 98.83 % to 99.49 % and from 0.64 to 0.77, respectively. Variable importance detected in the Random Forest (RF) model highlighted that the key to identifying UCSs lay in geospatial information describing UCS spatial distribution, including distance to roads, city boundaries, and dust-proof nets. The assessment of the utilization status for new construction areas highlights the differences in the utilization status with which cities at various stages of development utilize these new areas. We then compared the ability of UCS distribution with existing impervious surface products in reflecting the dynamics of urban construction. The results showed that UCS spatial distribution could reflect urban construction patterns more timely and accurately, providing key insights for urban planners. Overall, this study provides a universal methodology that can be referenced for mapping land covers that have low separability in spectral and textural features in complex urban environments.

Although the simulation of the oceanic vortex street phenomenon is crucial for understanding not only the mechanisms of vortex formation in fluid dynamics but also their impact on the surrounding environment, the traditional simulation relies on the strong theoretical hypothesis of Navier–Stokes equations. Here, we propose a self-supervised neural network with high generalization ability to implement Navier–Stokes equations, simulating realistic oceanic vortex streets. Specifically, the physical informed convolutional neural network is first employed to determine the corresponding pressure and velocity fields, achieving accurate simulation of oceanic vortex streets with lower computational cost; Then, the observational islands in SDGSAT-1 imagery are embedded as obstacles, meanwhile, the marine background field including wind and terrain is synchronously incorporated to achieve more realistic simulation results compared with traditional methods; Finally, the morphological parameters of oceanic vortex streets are calculated and associated analysis are carried out to deepen our understanding of small scale vortex street phenomena. In addition, the experimental results demonstrated our proposed method can obtain promising time efficiency. With this partial differential equation deep learning solver framework combining observation and theory, there will be potential to expedite the cognitive process of oceanic phenomena."

 Launched by China in 2021, the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) is the world's first science satellite dedicated to serving the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. In keeping with international aims of this 2030 agenda, the SDGSAT-1 data will be made available for open accee without any restrictions. The Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) onboard SDGSAT-1 has three thermal infrared channels with a high spatial resolution of 30 m. This enables precise monitoring of land surface temperature (LST), which is one of the most important variables measured by satellite remote sensing. This paper presents the development and validation of three split-window (SW) algorithms and the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm for SDGSAT-1 TIS data. These algorithms were rigorously tested through simulation, application, and validation to assess their retrieval accuracy and sensitivity. Simulation results indicate that the theoretical accuracy of the SW algorithms exceeds 1.0 K in most cases, and the TES algorithm shows higher retrieval accuracy with an average LST Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.60 K. With consideration of the comprehensive effects of instrument noise, land surface emissivity, and atmospheric parameter error, the LST retrieval accuracy of SW algorithms remains better than 1.7 K, and that of the TES algorithm is better than 1.5 K under most conditions. The ground validation utilized site data from the Heihe Integrated Observatory Network and the Surface Radiation budget network. The SW and TES algorithms achieved an accuracy of approximately 1.75 and 1.9 K, respectively. Additionally, a cross-validation based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data indicated average RMSDs of approximately 2.25 K for SW algorithms and 3.84 K for TES algorithm. Among the algorithms, the three-channel SW algorithm SW-2 has the best overall performance and is recommended as the LST retrieval method for SDGSAT-1 data. The TES algorithm is also suitable for SDGSAT-1 images because of its ability to retrieve LST and emissivity during both daytime and nighttime."

 The Tibetan Plateau and surroundings, commonly referred to as the Third Pole region, has the largest ice store outside the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Glacial lakes in the Third Pole region are expanding rapidly as glaciers thin and retreat. The Landsat satellite series is the most popular for mapping glacial lakes, benefiting from long-term archived data and suitable spatial resolution (30 m since ∼1990). However, the homogeneous mapping of high-quality, large-scale, and multi-temporal glacial lake inventories using Landsat imagery relies heavily on visual inspection and manual editing due to mountain shadows, wet ice, frozen lakes, and snow cover on lake boundaries, which is time consuming and labour-intensive. Deep learning methods have been applied to glacial lake extraction in the Third Pole and other regions, yet these methods are either concentrated on small test sites without large-scale applications or in polar regions. In this study, several classical deep convolutional neural networks were evaluated, and the DeepLabv3+ with Mobilenetv3 backbone performed best, with a high accuracy of mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 94.8 % and a low loss error of 0.4 %. The proposed method demonstrated robustness in challenging conditions such as mountain shadows, frozen or partially frozen lakes, wet ice and river contact, all without requiring extensive manual correction. Compared with manual delineation, the model's prediction has a precision rate of 86 %, recall rate of 85 %, and F1-score of 85 %. The area extracted by the model shows a strong correlation with the manual delineation (r2 = 0.97, slope = 0.94) and a high intersection over union (IoU > 0.8) of the predicted areas. A test of large-scale glacial lake mapping based on the developed automated model in 2020 across the Third Pole region shows the robust performance with 29,429 glacial lakes larger than 0.0054 km2 with a total area of ∼1779.9 km2 (including non-glacier-fed lakes). The model trained in this study can be fine-tuned for large-scale mapping of glacial lakes in other mountain regions worldwide."

 Azimuth or along-track (approximately north-south) motion is critical in constructing three-dimensional ground motion with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites orbiting the Earth in sun-synchronous polar orbit. The main problem of measuring azimuth motion with short-wavelength SAR data is decorrelation. A fleet of newly launched and upcoming long-wavelength L-band SAR satellites bring new opportunities for measuring azimuth motion. However, azimuth motion measured with L-band SAR data often contains large azimuth shifts caused by the Earth's ionosphere. We outline the framework of separating the azimuth motion and ionospheric azimuth shift from an analysis of the ionospheric effects on SAR images and SAR measurement precisions. We demonstrate three methods, among which one is newly proposed, can separate the azimuth motion and ionospheric azimuth shift with higher precisions. We evaluate the performances of the three methods by simulations using parameters of several selected L-band SAR satellites. The results show that, at kilometer resolutions, the azimuth motion measured by multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) can achieve centimeter precision, while the ionospheric azimuth shifts can be estimated with decimeter precision. Based on these results, a strategy for obtaining corrected azimuth motion is subsequently suggested, which achieves at least a first-order ionospheric correction of the original higher resolution MAI result. The three methods were also compared by real data processing examples. Furthermore, using real and simulated data of selected L-band SAR satellites, we present the first L-band MAI time series analysis result that measures subtle ground motion, as illustrated by the example of the postseismic deformation after the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes in Japan. The performance is expected to be further improved with future L-band SAR missions that have much higher duty cycles. Some geophysical applications, in particular, those associated with the Earth's tectonic processes, can thus benefit from the azimuth motion measured by L-band SAR data."

 In situ samples are essential for crop mapping, but the collection of samples is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the samples are usually only valid for the current year, due to the crop rotation across years. In this paper, we discuss an alternative solution, i.e., whether using transfer learning to mine useful information from historical products can achieve cross-year crop mapping without the need for in situ samples. However, there are two main challenges that limit the application of historical products: 1) the label mismatch problem, which is caused by the limited accuracy of the historical products and the cross-year changes in crop planting; and 2) the cross-year phenological mismatch problem, where the number and the date of the satellite imagery time series (SITS) are inconsistent across years, hindering the transferability of deep learning models. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end CRoss-year crOp maP UPdating (CROPUP) framework for crop mapping without the need for any in situ samples. Specifically, to solve the cross-year phenological mismatch problem, an UNequal tIme-series feaTure Extraction (UNITE) network is first introduced to unify the feature dimensions of the SITS of different years, which is then followed by a feature alignment module to align the key cross-year phenological features. In addition, to solve the label mismatch problem, the CROPUP framework introduces a noise-free label estimation loss to reduce the noisy labels in the historical products dynamically during training, which promotes the accuracy of cross-year crop mapping in an iterative manner. The CROPUP framework was verified in the Corn Belt in the U.S. for a long-term and multi-scene analysis and in Jianghan Plain in China for a large-area analysis, using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 SITS. The CROPUP framework is highly efficient, and still robust in the case of historical products with a high noisy label ratio. It also shows strength in early-season crop mapping. In addition, the experiments undertaken in this study indicated that the validity period for historical products is within about 5 years, and the accuracy decreases with an increase in time interval. We believe that the CROPUP framework will be a promising and efficient tool to support large-scale crop map updating without the need for in situ samples."

 Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are pivotal in scientific research and engineering because they provide essential topographic and geomorphological information. Voids in DEM data result in the loss of terrain information, significantly impacting its broad applicability. Although spatial interpolation methods are frequently employed to address these voids, they suffer from accuracy degradation and struggle to reconstruct intricate terrain features. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approaches have emerged as promising solutions to enhance elevation accuracy and facilitate the reconstruction of partial terrain features. Nonetheless, GAN-based methods exhibit limitations with specific void shapes, and their performance is susceptible to artifacts and elevation jumps around the void boundaries. To address shortcomings mentioned above, we propose a terrain feature-guided diffusion model (TFDM) to fill the DEM data voids. The training and inference processes of the diffusion model were constrained by terrain feature lines to ensure the stability of the generated DEM surface. The TFDM is distinguished by its ability to generate seamless DEM surfaces and maintain stable terrain contours in response to varying terrain conditions. Experiments were conducted to validate the applicability of TFDM using different DEMs, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Models (ASTER GDEMv3) and the TanDEM-X global DEM. The proposed TFDM algorithm and comparison methods such as DDPM, GAN, and Kriging were applied to a full test set of 271 DEM images covering different terrain environments. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the DEM restored by TFDM were 28.91 ± 9.45 m and 38.16 ± 13.00 m, respectively, while the MAE and RMSE of the comparison algorithms were no less than 60.87 ± 26.24 m and 82.80 ± 36.51 m or even higher, validating the effectiveness of the TFDM algorithm in filling DEM voids. Profile analysis in partial details indicates that the TFDM outperforms alternative methods in reconstructing terrain features, as confirmed through visual inspection and quantitative comparison. TFDM exhibits versatility when applied to DEM data with diverse resolutions and produced using various measurement techniques."

 The grounding line marks the transition between a glacier's floating and grounded parts and serves as a crucial parameter for monitoring sea level changes and assessing glacier retreat. The Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique for grounding line mapping currently requires the involvement of human experts, which becomes challenging with the continuously growing volume of grounding line data available for every Antarctic glacier. While a deep learning approach has been recently proposed for mapping grounding lines over C-band Sentinel-1 DInSAR data, its effectiveness has not been assessed over X-Band COSMO-SkyMed DInSAR data. Similarly, the applicability of an analytical algorithm developed for X-band TerraSAR-X DInSAR data has not been evaluated over a large diverse dataset. Here we apply both techniques to map grounding lines over a large X-band COSMO-SkyMed DInSAR dataset from 2020 to 2022, covering Stancomb-Wills, Veststraumen, Jutulstraumen, Moscow University, and Rennick Antarctic glaciers. We determine strengths and limitations of each algorithm, compare their performance with manual mapping and provide recommendations for choosing appropriate data processing methods for effective grounding line mapping. We also note that since 1996, Moscow University glacier's main trunk was retreating at a rate of 340 ± 80 m/year, while the other four glaciers experienced no retreat. Considering the grounding zone widths, which represent the difference between the high and low tide grounding line positions during a tidal cycle, we detect a grounding zone of 9.7 km over Veststraumen Glacier, which is almost six times larger than the average grounding zone of the other four glaciers."

 Ecosystem dynamics and ecological disturbances manifest as breakpoints in long-term multispectral remote sensing time series. Typically, these breakpoints are captured using univariate methods applied individually to each band, with subsequent integration of the results. However, multivariate analysis provides a promising way to fully incorporate the multispectral bands into breakpoints detection methods, but it has been rarely applied in monitoring ecosystem dynamics and detecting ecological disturbances. In this research, we developed a multivariate algorithm, named breakpoints-Detection algoRithm using MultivAriate Time series (DRMAT). DRMAT can fully use multispectral bands simultaneously with the consideration of the inter-correlation among bands. It decomposes a multivariate time series into trend, seasonality, and noise, iteratively segmenting the detrended/de-seasonalized signals. We quantitatively evaluated DRMAT using both simulated multivariate data and randomly sampled real-world data, including subtle land cover changes caused by forest disturbances (depletions) and recovery (return of vegetation), as well as subtle changes over a broad range of land cover types. We also qualitatively assessed DRMAT in mapping real-world disturbances. For simulated data with prescribed breakpoints in both trend and seasonality, DRMAT detected breakpoints in trend with an F1 score of 85.5 % and in seasonality with an F1 score of 91.7 %. For real-world data in forested land cover, DRMAT unveiled both disturbances and subsequent recovery with an F1 score of 95.1 % for disturbances and 77.1 % for recovery. It detected disturbances in broader land cover types with an F1 score of 84.0 %. We demonstrated that using all-band data was more accurate than using selected bands in breakpoint detection. The inclusion of vegetation indices as model inputs did not improve accuracy unless the original input bands lacked the specific band information in the vegetation indices. As a multivariate approach, DRMAT leverages the full information in the multispectral data and avoids the necessity of integrating results derived from individual bands."

 The acquisition of high-quality reference data is essential for effectively modelling forest attributes. Incorporating close-range Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems into the reference data collection stage of remote sensing-based forest inventories can not only increase data collection efficiency but also increase the number of attributes measured with high quality. Therefore, we propose a model-based forest inventory method that uses reference data collected by a car-mounted mobile laser scanning (MLS) system along boreal forest roads. This approach is used for the estimation of diameter at breast height (DBH) and stem volume at the individual tree-level from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. In addition, we compare the estimates obtained using the proposed method with the ones derived from reference data collected by traditional field inventory of 265 field plots systematically distributed over the study area.

In general, biases were below 1 cm for most species classes, with the exception of deciduous trees. The accuracy of stem volume also had RMSEs varying across different tree species.

 Sea surface currents are of significant importance in various scientific and maritime applications. There are several measurement techniques available to study surface currents, however, they have limitations in spatial coverage and resolution. This study presents a proof-of-concept for a new measurement principle that relies on the difference between a ship’s speed relative to water and land. The approach involves estimating the ship speed vector relative to water from optical satellite imagery of Kelvin wakes. This ship speed vector is subtracted from the ship speed over ground, which is determined from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, to estimate the surface current. A case study in the Strait of Gibraltar was performed using two months of Sentinel-2 imagery, which yielded 81 visible Kelvin wakes over 25 images. Surface currents were estimated in directions parallel and perpendicular to the ship’s sailing line for each Kelvin wake. The estimated currents were validated with respect to surface currents derived from High-Frequency Radars (HFRs) and modelled currents from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The uncertainty in the two surface current components was estimated using triple collocation. After removing 12 data points with large ship course variability, standard deviations of 0.14 and 0.16 m s−1 were estimated for the surface currents along and across the sailing line, respectively. Despite limitations in measurement frequency due to satellite revisit times, cloud cover and Kelvin wake visibility, this new method can provide accurate estimates of sea surface currents in regions with high vessel density."

 Accurate nearshore bathymetry estimation remains a critical challenge, impacting coastal forecasting evolution assessments through the inaccuracies in both in-situ and remote sensing surveys. This article introduces the Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) temporal correlation method, showcasing its ability in deriving accurate nearshore bathymetry from one minute spaceborne videos. The approach utilises correlation of pixel intensity time series, shifted in time and space, extracted from a frame stack within a defined correlation window. The resulting correlation is then projected using the Radon Transform to infer wave characteristics (celerity and wavelength) for the estimation of depth through wave linear dispersion. Moreover, the adaptation of the correlation window based on a first wavelength estimation provided a more focused assessment of the wavefield that reveals morphological features such as sandbars in the bathymetric estimation. The method’s capabilities using adapted correlation window is illustrated through its application to a metric resolution Jilin satellite video (57 s at 5 Hz) along the Saint-Louis coast in Senegal. Through this demonstration, the temporal correlation method is among the first SDB methods to successfully capture the submerged sandbar along a beach. Comparison against in-situ measurements conducted three years prior to the video acquisition shows a good agreement with a bias of 0.97 m within the initial 2 km of the cross-shore profile.

 The vegetation dynamics in highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g., riparian vegetation surrounding waterholes and oases) are difficult to detect from large (e.g., MODIS) and moderate (e.g., Landsat) spatial resolution remote sensing products. Within a “classify-to-monitor” approach, a method to monitor spatially heterogeneous riparian vegetation dynamics is developed by integrating high spatial resolution discrete return airborne LiDAR data (1 m pixels) with moderate resolution Landsat fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (fPAR) data (30 m). LiDAR was used to identify and classify vegetation surrounding permanent waterholes within the Cooper Creek floodplain, in dryland Australia. These waterholes are important areas for ecological conservation given their highly spatially heterogeneous vegetation structure. Landsat fPAR was temporally decomposed into persistent and recurrent components and then integrated with the LiDAR-derived vegetation classes. The LiDAR data were used as a mask to separate the fPAR signal of each vegetation class, capturing their specific dynamics and which fPAR component they are associated with. The newly developed method provides the means to improve the interpretation of Landsat fPAR by monitoring distinct vegetation functional groups within each Landsat pixel. Results showed that LiDAR data provided good estimates of vegetation cover compared to field measurements (R2=0.952). LiDAR data identified different vegetation structural classes within the riparian zone. The integration of LiDAR and Landsat data permitted the distinction of temporal patterns of each vegetation structural class, uncovering the specific temporal and spatial variability of fPAR that would otherwise be undetected. Landsat fPAR provided information on which vegetation component contributed to the fPAR variability in each class, thus providing the means for enhanced ecological interpretation of the temporally decomposed fPAR components. The method can be applied to other similar highly spatially heterogeneous ecosystems to monitor structurally specific vegetation dynamics more accurately than if only using moderate spatial resolution time-series optical satellite imagery."

 Branch architecture provides crucial information for the understanding of plant trait variability and the adaptive strategies employed by trees in response to their environment. High-fidelity terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data provide an accurate, efficient, and non-destructive means for constructing three-dimensional (3D) tree models and estimating architectural traits. However, the complex canopy structure of trees in natural forests and the presence of occlusion in TLS data pose significant challenges to achieving this goal. In this study, we present a novel algorithm, L1-Tree, for the construction of 3D tree models and the estimation of architectural traits from TLS data. This algorithm is grounded in the L1-Median algorithm and integrates a tree skeleton optimization procedure that considers the structural characteristics of tree branches. By comparing modeling results and manually derived branch traits for 24 trees of 24 species, we found that the L1-Tree algorithm achieved precision, recall, and F-score values of 0.94 for branch identification, coefficient of determination, root-mean-squared error, and normalized root-mean-squared error of 0.998, 0.068 m, and 0.3 % for branch length estimation, and a respective value of 0.958, 0.257 cm and 0.9 % for branch radius estimation. Additionally, the branch identification accuracy and accuracy in branch architectural trait estimation remained satisfactory across branch orders. Compared to established 3D tree model construction algorithms (e.g., TreeQSM), our L1-Tree algorithm demonstrated a superior capability in handling noisy environments and data gaps, making it a robust tool for TLS data-based tree architecture studies. Leaf-wood separation emerged as a crucial step influencing the performance of the L1-Tree algorithm. We observed significant drop in branch identification accuracy when using an automatic leaf-wood separation algorithm as input, highlighting the urgent need to develop effective leaf-wood separation algorithms to generate high-quality wood point clouds for tree architecture studies."

 Satellite altimetry data has become essential for studying the dynamics of water bodies, especially in regions with limited or inaccessible data. Traditional low-resolution mode (LRM) satellites' accuracy cannot be guaranteed when it comes to assessing water levels in small- (< 200 m in width) and medium-sized (200–800 m in width) rivers. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeters, exemplified by Sentinel-3 A, have shown great potential for inland water altimetry. Nevertheless, developing algorithms to retrack the raw data remains an essential requirement in this context. This is attributed to the width of small-sized rivers, which is often narrower than the along-track resolution of both LRM and SAR altimeters. In addition, new altimeters may have long revisit cycles and different spatial coverage and cannot yield historical data necessary in some situations.To address these challenges, this study proposed a conditional threshold retracker (CTR). The CTR algorithm is well-designed and facilitates accurate water level monitoring. Moreover, we proposed an enhanced footprint filter (EFF), thus significantly bolstering the number of available cycles. Our findings demonstrate that the developed method substantially enhances the temporal and spatial resolution of both LRM and SAR altimetry satellites during water level monitoring in rivers of different climate types. The width of the thirteen selected rivers is on the order of 85–630 m. The CTR significantly improved the water level monitoring accuracy by 68 %–78 %. Furthermore, the EFF increased the number of water level cycles by approximately 49 %–68 %. These findings have practical implications for obtaining accurate water level data, estimating river discharge and improving hydraulic model calibration."

 Flood emergency mapping is essential for flood management, often requiring near real-time extraction of large-scale flood extents by combining pre- and post-event multi-source remote sensing images. Pre-event optical imagery delineates the normal water extent, providing a benchmark for estimation of post-flood changes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery provides rapid and accurate interpretation of flood inundation extent during the rainy period. Post-classification comparison is one of the fundamental methods for flood mapping of multi-source imagery, as the image characteristics of SAR and optical imagery are inherently different. However, the accuracy of flood mapping depends on the accuracy of water body delineation from single temporal imagery, which can lead to error propagation in flood extent determination. Change detection methods can extract flood extent directly from pre- and post-event imagery, but the models need to learn a consistent flood feature description between optical and SAR imagery from a limited flood dataset. Here, we propose an automatic method for flood inundation extent extraction using pre- and post-event multi-source imagery that requires only a small number of pseudo-change labels. The methodology adopts a pseudo-Siamese network framework as a Heterogeneous - Flood Inundation Extraction Network (H-FIENet), to detect flood extent between the pre‐ and post-event heterogeneous images. Spatially inconsistent multi-source pre- and post-event imagery was used to create a pseudo flood dataset, and this dataset was used to transfer water body feature knowledge from the pre-trained model to the flood extraction model using a cross-task knowledge transfer strategy. Pre- and post-event images from different satellite sources and different flood scenarios were used to evaluate the performance of H-FIENet. We found that: (1) The methodology produced an overall accuracy of over 0.94 for flood inundation extraction from multi-source heterogeneous pre- and post-event imagery. (2) H-FIENet can detect both expansion and recession of the flood extent using any dual-temporal imagery.

 The fraction of green vegetation is a widely-used indicator of vegetation abundance at regional and/or global scales. The pixel mixture model, especially the dimidiate pixel model (DPM, also referred to as two-endmember model) based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plays an important role in the accurate estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) via remote sensing. The two components in the traditional DPM are vegetation and soil (both sunlit and shaded). However, to date, the influence of shaded vegetation and shaded soil has not been fully considered in the NDVI-based DPM. Herein we analyze the necessity and feasibility of processing shaded components separately. The shaded soil was found to largely affect the canopy NDVI and can be combined with the vegetation (both sunlit and shaded) as one of the two components in DPM due to the high NDVI of shaded soil under a small percentage of diffuse sky radiation (< 10 % of the total hemispherical radiation in red band in this study). This finding partially explains why the canopy NDVI is oversensitive to background. The DPM was then improved with the solar and view angles to account for the fraction of shaded soil. We performed simulation and field measurements to validate the proposed models to varying factors including the vegetation structure, soil background, solar and view geometry, and slope gradient. The improved DPMs outperformed the traditional DPM (i.e., where no effect of shaded soil is considered) when estimating the NDVI and FVC of the mixed pixel. The FVC estimated with traditional DPM results in the RMSE from 0.14 to 0.31, and that with the improved DPMs range from 0.04 to 0.13. The decrease of uncertainty by using the improved DPMs was generally over 50 % when compared to the output from a traditional DPM. The proposed DPM maintains the advantage of an easy-of-use two-component mixture model yet is more accurate than traditional ones and thus expected to improve the FVC estimation from satellite data."

 Although wetlands are widely recognized for thier important role in providing ecosystem services, their abundance, spatial extent, and condition remain poorly constrained and at-risk of decline. Accurate mapping and monitoring are therefore essential for their protection. However, distinguishing swamps from upland forests and shrublands is especially challenging because optical sensors cannot detect water and/or saturated soil under dense canopies. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers distinct advantages in this regard: (1) under certain conditions, microwaves can penetrate vegetation and provide a strong backscattered signal from double bounce when surface water or very wet soil are present, and (2) microwaves can penetrate clouds, providing an opportunity to monitor changes in moisture or the extent of flooding through time. In spite of these advantages, users may still find it difficult to know which wavelengths, incidence angles, polarization states, and times of year can be used to detect swamps because of the complexity of choices, and some confusing and conflicting results presented in the literature. The goal of this research was therefore to better elucidate the impacts of sensor and environmental characteristics on the seasonal backscattering behaviour observed in and separability between swamps and dry, upland forests and shrublands, as well as determine the need for additional ancillary data like digital elevation models and derivatives to improve mapping accuracy. Using SAR data from three sensors with two different wavelengths, various polarization states, and a range of incidence angles we: (1) investigate the drivers of variations in seasonal trends and the frequency and timing of changes among different SAR time series, and assess their impact on separability, (2) quantify the importance of acquisition timing, type, number of derivatives on the accuracy of Random Forest models. Our results show that a common pre-conception that longer wavelengths are preferred for distinguishing flooded versus upland forests and shrublands has proven overly general, that data acquired before leaf flush in the spring provides superior results, and that DEM data only provides an advantage when using sub-optimal SAR data."

 Precise and timely information about crop types plays a crucial role in various agriculture-related applications. However, crop type mapping methods often face significant challenges in cross-regional and cross-time scenarios with high discrepancies between temporal-spectral characteristics of crops from different regions and years. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been employed to mitigate the problem of domain shift between the source and target domains. Since these methods require source domain data during the adaptation phase, they demand significant computational resources and data storage, especially when large labeled crop mapping source datasets are available. This leads to increased energy consumption and financial costs. To address this limitation, we developed a source-free UDA method for cross-regional and cross-time crop mapping, capable of adapting the source-pretrained models to the target datasets without requiring the source datasets. The method mitigates the domain shift problem by leveraging mutual information loss. The diversity and discriminability terms in the loss function are balanced through a novel unsupervised weighting strategy based on mean confidence scores of the predicted categories. Our experiments on mapping corn, soybean, and the class Other from Landsat image time series in the U.S. demonstrated that the adapted models using different backbone networks outperformed their non-adapted counterparts. With CNN, Transformer, and LSTM backbone networks, our adaptation method increased the macro F1 scores by 12.9%, 7.1%, and 5.8% on average in cross-time tests and by 20.1%, 12.5%, and 8.8% on average in cross-regional tests, respectively. Additionally, in an experiment covering a large study area of 450 km × 300 km, the adapted model with the CNN backbone network obtained a macro F1 score of 92.6%, outperforming its non-adapted counterpart with a macro F1 score of 89.2%. Our experiments on mapping the same classes using Sentinel-2 image times series in France demonstrated the effectiveness of our method across different countries and sensors. We also tested our method in more diverse agricultural areas in Denmark and France containing six classes. The results showed that the adapted models outperformed the non-adapted models. Moreover, in within-season experiments, the adapted models performed better than the non-adapted models in the vast majority of weeks. These results and their comparison to those obtained by the other investigated UDA methods demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed method for both end-of-season and within-season crop mapping tasks. Additionally, our study showed that the method is modular and flexible in employing various backbone networks. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Sina-Mohammadi/SFUDA-CropMapping."

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a subtle but informative probe of plant photosynthesis. Quantifying the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of SIF benefits a better understanding of photosynthesis variations over heterogeneous canopies. Although radiative transfer models (RTMs) provide a solid theoretical basis for simulating the 3D SIF distribution, most RTMs use virtual scenes with complex reconstruction processes. This study aims to develop a 3D SIF simulation model (FluorLiDAR) directly driven by terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data using leaf and canopy RTMs, including a 3D PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) simulation model, the Fluspect model, the atmosphere radiative transfer module in SCOPE, and the multiple scattering coefficients of sunlit and shaded leaves from the 4-scale model. The results show that (1) the simulated and measured SIF patterns were consistent, with R2 (RMSE) values of 0.73 (0.17 mW/nm/m2/sr) and 0.76 (0.12 mW/nm/m2/sr) for 1-min sampling and 10-min averages, respectively. Moreover, the R2 between FluorLiDAR and the DART simulation reached 0.94. The R2 of FluorLiDAR and DART were both higher than 1D mSCOPE using every 10-min sampling data. (2) Point density, denoted by average NPD (nearest point distance), influenced the performance of our model mainly when it was smaller than 0.1 m. Chlorophyll content had less influence on the model accuracy (R2 and rRMSE), and the bias between simulation and measurement decreased as chlorophyll content increased. (3) The simulated 3D SIF distribution pattern closely resembled PAR within the canopy. Besides, FluorLiDAR can simulate the hot spot effect like DART and mSCOPE though the effect was not as obvious as the other two models. This study highlights the potential of a LiDAR-driven SIF model for 3D SIF simulation over a heterogeneous canopy, which may benefit the understanding of the structural impacts on forest photosynthesis in real forest scenes."

 We developed the SCARF (Spatial Mismatch and Systematic Prediction Error Corrected cAscade Random Forests) algorithm for continuous prediction of biomass dynamics using machine learning and Landsat Time Series (LTS). Our approach addresses the challenges posed by the cloudy subtropical forests in southern China, where monitoring biomass dynamics is notoriously difficult. To derive spectral-temporal features from the LTS, we applied the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014). Subsequently, we employed the cascade random forests machine learning algorithm for biomass prediction. This new approach corrects the spatial mismatch effects between plots and Landsat pixels as well as the systematic prediction errors in the machine learning model. As a result, it substantially enhances biomass prediction accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.83 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.27 Mg ha-1. In comparison, the commonly used random forests approach yields an R2 of 0.47 and RMSE of 8.52 Mg ha-1. Additionally, it provides reliable spatial prediction beyond the model-training area, achieving an R2 of 0.79 and an RMSE of 6.62 Mg ha-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modeling five different forest age groups separately further improves prediction accuracies, resulting in an increased R2 of 0.87 and a reduced RMSE of 3.65 Mg ha-1. A comparison of the allometric model prediction from the field plots and those from the SCARF model revealed a strong agreement, indicating that this approach can provide a temporally continuous prediction of biomass dynamics.

 Phase unwrapping is the process of retrieving the true phase values from observed wrapped phases by adding the correct multiples of 2π. This process is crucial in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry, and numerous studies have aimed to enhance its performance. This study explored phase unwrapping using a modified U-Net regression model by optimizing both the network structure and training data. For network structure optimization, the study first compared model performance based on the size ratio of the lowest feature maps, determined by the number of pooling layers, to the size of convolutional kernels. A multi-kernel U-Net structure was developed to ensure robustness against variations in phase noise and gradient, compared to a standard single-kernel U-Net. Regarding the training data, data augmentation was implemented to address imbalances and better represent the local noise characteristics found in actual SAR interferograms. The training data was simulated to include local noise effects based on coherence measurements from real SAR data, as well as simple noise used for benchmarking the unwrapping performance with different training datasets. The results indicated that when the convolutional kernel size is smaller than the feature map size at the lowest layer, increasing the number of pooling layers leads to improvements in unwrapping performance. Conversely, performance decreased when the feature map size at the lowest layers was smaller than the convolutional kernel size. Specifically, the single-kernel U-Net with six pooling layers and the multi-kernel U-Net with five pooling layers exhibited the best unwrapping performance. Considering both simulated and real synthetic aperture radar interferogram data, the mean absolute errors for the single- and multi-kernel U-Net trained with simple noise were approximately 0.235 and 0.254, respectively. In contrast, for models trained with locally variable noise simulation data, the MAEs dropped to about 0.033 and 0.032, showing an improvement by approximately eightfold over models trained with simple noise. For real synthetic aperture radar interferograms, the mean absolute errors were 0.542 (single-kernel U-Net trained using simple noise), 0.592 (multi-kernel U-Net trained using simple noise), 0.542 (single-kernel U-Net trained using local noise), and 0.445 (proposed), respectively, underscoring the significant impact of training data on unwrapping performance. The study also evaluated the performance of the statistical-cost, network-flow algorithm for phase unwrapping (SNAPHU), obtaining mean absolute errors of about 0.043 for simulation data and 0.861 for real SAR data. Consequently, the multi-kernel model trained with locally different noise simulation data demonstrated roughly twice the performance compared to the traditional phase unwrapping method."

 Detailed population maps play an important role in diverse fields ranging from humanitarian action to urban planning. Generating such maps in a timely and scalable manner presents a challenge, especially in data-scarce regions. To address it we have developed Popcorn, a population mapping method whose only inputs are free, globally available satellite images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2; and a small number of aggregate population counts over coarse census districts for calibration. Despite the minimal data requirements our approach surpasses the mapping accuracy of existing schemes, including several that rely on building footprints derived from high-resolution imagery. E.g., we were able to produce population maps for Rwanda with 100m GSD based on less than 400 regional census counts. In Kigali, those maps reach an R2 score of 66% w.r.t. a ground truth reference map, with an average error of only ±10 inhabitants/ha. Conveniently, Popcorn retrieves explicit maps of built-up areas and local building occupancy rates, making the mapping process interpretable and offering additional insights, for instance about the distribution of built-up, but unpopulated areas, e.g., industrial warehouses. With our work we aim to democratize access to up-to-date and high-resolution population maps, recognizing that some regions faced with particularly strong population dynamics may lack the resources for costly micro-census campaigns.

 For over four decades, spaceborne multispectral data have played a crucial role in supporting mineral exploration and geologic mapping. The spaceborne multispectral datasets, however, have a restricted number of bands with coarse spectral resolution and, thus are very limited in mineral mapping. The advent of high-quality spaceborne imaging spectroscopic data like the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), has bridged this gap initiating a new era in global hyperspectral mineral mapping. The EnMAP satellite, operational since November 2022, covers the spectral range of 420 and 2450 nm in 224 bands, offering a spatial resolution of 30 m and a mean spectral sampling distance of 8.1 and 12.5 nm in the visible-near infrared and shortwave infrared regions, respectively. In this paper, we demonstrate the enhanced mapping capabilities of EnMAP using datasets acquired over the Reko Diq mining district, a cluster of Miocene porphyries located in Pakistan's Chagai Belt hosting an undeveloped world-class porphyry Cu-Au ± Mo deposit. The EnMAP's Level 2A data product was processed using the polynomial fitting technique to characterize the diagnostic absorption features of the alteration minerals in the Reko Diq porphyry system. This involved retrieving the minimum wavelength, depth, width, and asymmetry parameters for key absorption features and employing them interactively for mineral characterization. A diverse array of minerals were successfully mapped over the study area and validated by ground spectroscopy. This includes abundance/composition maps for white micas, chlorite, epidote, calcite, kaolinite, gypsum, jarosite, and ferric and ferrous iron minerals. The minimum wavelength of white mica was found to vary between 2195 and 2210 nm, with the shorter wavelengths (Al-rich) white mica occurring proximal to the known mineralized zones. The potassic alteration cores and the outer propylitic zones were identified by the ferrous iron and chlorite-epidote-calcite mineral maps, respectively. This study demonstrated the superiority of EnMAP hyperspectral data in delineating the alteration mineralogy and zonation pattern of porphyry copper systems.

 Accurate spatio-temporal information on rice cropping patterns is vital for predicting grain production, managing water resource and assessing greenhouse gas emissions. However, current automated mapping of rice cropping patterns at regional scale is heavily constrained by insufficient training samples and frequent cloudy weathers in major rice-producing areas. To tackle this challenge, we proposed a Phenology domain Optical-SAR feature inTegration method to Automatically generate single (SC-Rice) and double cropping Rice (DC-Rice) sample (POSTAR) for efficient and refined rice mapping. POSTAR includes three major steps: (1) generating a potential rice map using a phenology- and object-based classification method with optical data (Sentinel-2 MSI) to select candidate rice samples; (2) employing K-means to identify SC- and DC-Rice candidate samples according to unique SAR-based (Sentinel-1 SAR) phenological features; (3) implementing a two-step refinement strategy to filter high-confidence SC- and DC-Rice samples, maintaining a balance between intraclass phenological variance and sample purity. Test areas selected for validation include the Dongting Lake plain and Poyang Lake plain in South China, as well as Fujin county located in the Sanjiang plain of North China. POSTAR proved effective in producing reliable SC- and DC-Rice samples, achieving a high spectral correlation similarity (>0.85) and low dynamic time wrapping distance (<8.5) with field samples. Applying POSTAR-derived samples to random forest classifier yielded an overall accuracy of 89.6%, with F1 score of 0.899 for SC-Rice and 0.938 for DC-Rice in the Dongting Lake plain. Owing to the incorporation of knowledge-based optical and SAR phenological features, POSTAR exhibited strong spatial transferability, achieving an overall accuracy of 96.0% in the Poyang Lake plain and 97.8% in the Fujin county. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the POSTAR method in accurately mapping rice cropping patterns without extensive field visits, providing valuable insights for crop monitoring in large, diverse, and cloudy regions through the integration of optical and SAR data."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a unique remote sensing instrument imaging ocean surface waves in two dimensions with high spatial resolution regardless of sunlight and weather conditions. However, due to the nonlinear imaging process, the ocean wave spectra cannot be retrieved directly from SAR data. The emergence of deep learning (DL) techniques provides a new paradigm for addressing this challenge. In this paper, a deep-learning-based model, called Wave-Spec-CNN, is proposed for retrieving omni-directional ocean wave spectra from SAR data. This model is constructed using approximately 21,000 collocations of Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide swath mode images matched with global in-situ buoy data. The model adapts the convolution neural network (CNN) to accommodate the multi-valued nature of omni-directional ocean wave spectra, enhances performance by integrating a calibration branch and further incorporates physical characteristics into the training process. The results demonstrate consistency with buoy measurements for significant wave height (SWH) in the range of 0.5 m to 6 m, yielding a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.51 m on the validation dataset, comparable to traditional physical-based methods. In terms of mean wave period (MWP) and peak frequency (PF), the achieved RMSEs are of 1.24 s and 0.03 Hz, respectively. The retrieved omni-directional ocean wave spectra also allow to separate swell and windsea components for respective comparisons with those derived by in-situ buoy data. The RMSEs of respective SWH comparisons are of 0.46 m and 0.42 m. This research represents an initial endeavor into utilizing DL for the long-standing challenge of SAR inversion for ocean wave spectra, as well as providing valuable insights for employing DL in multi-parameter inversion tasks in remote sensing."

 Information on the sowing areas and yields of crops is important for ensuring food security and reforming the agricultural modernization process, while crop classification and identification are core issues when attempting to acquire information on crop planting areas and yields. Obtaining information on crop planting areas and yields in a timely and accurate manner is highly important for optimizing crop planting structures, formulating agricultural policies, and ensuring national economic development. In this paper, a fine crop classification model based on multitemporal Sentinel-2 images, CTANet, is proposed. It comprises a convolutional attention architecture (CAA) and a temporal attention architecture (TAA), incorporating spatial attention modules, channel attention modules and temporal attention modules. These modules adaptively weight each pixel, channel and temporal phase of the given feature map to mitigate the intraclass spatial heterogeneity, spectral variability and temporal variability of crops. Additionally, the auxiliary features of significant importance for each crop category are identified using the random forest-SHAP algorithm, enabling the construction of classification datasets containing spectral bands, spectral bands with auxiliary features, and spectral bands with optimized auxiliary features. Evaluations conducted on three crop classification datasets revealed that the proposed CTANet approach and its key CANet component demonstrated superior crop classification performance on the classification dataset consisting of spectral bands and optimized auxiliary features in comparisons with the other tested models. Based on this dataset, CTANet achieved higher validation accuracy and lower validation loss than those of the other methods, and during testing, it attained the highest overall accuracy (93.9 %) and MIoU (87.5 %).

 As the network structures continue to innovate and evolve, significant achievements have been achieved in hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, how to further explore the spectral domain potential from prior knowledge and channel-enhanced structures to achieve better performance has inspired the following two works: Firstly, to systematically compare prior knowledge of spectral with spatial domain for HSI-SR tasks, four transfer learning strategies are proposed. The superior performance of the Relevant Channel/Random Space (RCRS) strategy reveals the importance of spectral feature reconstruction in HSI-SR tasks. Meanwhile, an interesting phenomenon has been observed that even without training on real datasets, the model can already exhibit a core or even decent super-resolution capability based solely on prior knowledge of above four strategies. Secondly, a dual-branch channel network with complementary channel feature extraction (CCFE) and adjacent channel feature extraction (ACFE) module is designed for spectral feature enhancement, which demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on six datasets. To conclude, the effectiveness of RCRS strategy with pseudo prior channel knowledge on seven dual-input and eight single-input networks, as well as superiority of the proposed channel-enhanced network indicate the importance of spectral properties for HSI-SR tasks."

 Improving the accuracy of nearshore bathymetric measurements is essential for understanding coastal environments, resource management, and navigation.

The ICESat-2 is equipped with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), which enables higher-accuracy measurements of water, ice, and land elevation on Earth. Two-media photogrammetric bathymetry is a type of nearshore bathymetric technology that uses the geometrical characteristics of light rays. With this technique, the accuracy and reliability mainly depend on eliminating systematic errors and ensuring accurate spatial photogrammetric positioning relative to the object being measured. To improve the bathymetric accuracy of two-media photogrammetry, we integrated high-accuracy elevation data from photon datasets as constraining and control parameters.

 Urban green spaces (UGS) provide ecological and habitat benefits such as carbon sequestration, oxygen production, humidity increase, noise reduction, and pollution absorption. UGS maps derived from remote sensing images serve as the fundamental data for urban planning and carbon sequestration assessments. However, the spatial resolution of remote sensing image and the pattern of urban structures significantly influence UGS mapping, making it challenging to obtain accurate UGS maps. To investigate the impact of spatial resolution on UGS mapping, this study utilized five different spatial resolution datasets: Gaofen2 (1 m, 4 m), Sentinel2 (10 m), and Landsat8 (15 m, 30 m). Random forest, LightGBM, and support vector machine were employed to map UGS, and the accuracies of UGS maps at different spatial resolutions were compared. Subsequently, the spatial distribution patterns of uncertainties in UGS maps were analyzed from both overall and urban functional zone perspectives. Furthermore, the uncertainty analysis of UGS mapping was conducted considering different landscape patterns in urban functional zones. The results indicate: (1) UGS map varies at different spatial resolution. Higher uncertainties associated with coarser spatial resolutions. Medium and coarse spatial resolution images inadequately capture the fine-grained distribution of urban green spaces. (2) Uncertainty in UGS mapping at different spatial resolutions is generally consistent in spatial distribution. From a functional zoning perspective, the accuracy of green space mapping over non-natural zones is sensitive to spatial resolution. (3) The distribution pattern of UGS patches affects the accuracy of UGS mapping. Uncertainty can be reduced in UGS mapping at medium and coarse spatial resolutions based on UGS landscape pattern indices by multiple linear regression, random forest and LightGBM model. This study comprehensively reveals that uncertainties in mapping UGS from multi-spatial resolution remote sensing images vary across urban functional zones and landscape pattern indices, and it is the first attempt to propose methods for UGS area correction based on landscape pattern indices. The results of this study will facilitate the application of remote sensing data at different spatial resolutions in urban areas."

This paper introduces a Progressive CNN-Transformer Alternating Reconstruction Network (PCTARN) to alternately utilize robust convolutional attention and transpose Transformer self-attention. A Dual-Path CNN-Transformer Alternating Reconstruction Module (DPCTARM) is proposed to dynamically introduce global–local dynamic priors at various levels to facilitate extracting high- and low-frequency features. This enhancement effectively strengthens PCTARN’s capability to discern valuable signals. To verify the proposed method, a spectral dataset based on seven selected red tide algae is collected. And a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metric of 34.58 dB is achieved, which is at least 0.44 dB higher than the methods such as MAUN and MST++. While the Params and FLOPS are reduced by over 41.9 % and 38.4 %, respectively. Since the performance of the proposed PCTARN depends not only on image quality but also on spectral fidelity, an application of spectral detection on red tide are conducted for this purpose. Four feature bands are selected from multispectral images and reconstructed into 20-band hyperspectral images by using PCTARN. Species identification and cell concentration detection are conducted based on the reconstructed images. The results demonstrate that PCTARN can enhance the spatial signal and spectral peak differences of red tide samples, achieving an identification accuracy of 94.21 % and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9660 in species identification and cell concentration detection, which are respectively improved by 11.55 % and 11.59 % compared to those of 4-band multispectral detection."

 The process of crop type mapping generates land use maps, which serve as critical tools for efficient evaluation of production factors and impacts of agricultural practice. Yet, despite the necessity for comprehensive solutions in space and time, the state of research still exhibits significant limitations in these two dimensions: (1) From a temporal perspective, the primary focus of past research in crop type mapping has been on the economically most meaningful, main-season crops, thereby largely neglecting the explicit study of off-season vegetation despite its pivotal roles in year-round management cycles. (2) Viewed spatially, study areas in crop type mapping show distinct limitations from a multi- and transnational standpoint, despite intense cross-regional and international interrelations of agricultural production and an increasing number of countries publishing crop reference data. With a focus on Europe, this research aims to tackle the two described shortcomings (a) by investigating to what extent a selection of major off-season, winter vegetation types in continental Europe can be classified and (b) by analyzing the transnational applicability of the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) for remote sensing-based crop type mapping across the European Union (EU). This study uses ESA’s Sentinel-2 satellite data, EU’s administrative farming declarations, and HCAT labels to analyze off-season farming measures, based on a study period from late summer to spring, in Austria, France, Germany, and Slovenia. We demonstrate that deep learning models effectively identify major productive and agroecogically significant winter vegetation in continental Europe. HCAT proves thereby valuable for transnational crop classification, excelling in mixed-country experiments and showing potential for transfer learning. This study’s findings provide a solid foundation for advancing transnational as well as winter and all-year crop type mapping, thereby serving as contribution towards temporally and spatially holistic research on agricultural practices’ sociocultural, economic, and environmental impacts."

 To attain sustainable development goals and understand urban growth patterns, continuous and precise monitoring of built-up area heights is essential. This helps reveal how urban form evolution impacts the thermal environment. Previous research often used isolated images, ignoring the temporal dimension of thermal infrared and reflectance data from Landsat sensors. Additionally, cost-effective and efficient methods for reconstructing time-series built height are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized Landsat time-series data to reconstruct the yearly trends in urban form in Beijing, China, spanning from 1990 to 2020. Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time series analysis method was used to identify urban growth and renewal years. Employing a reference height for 2020 and logical reasoning method, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights, pinpointing years of significant change. Finally, we analyzed the alterations in urban form over the past three decades and their impact on surface temperature changes. Our change detection method achieved an overall accuracy of 86 %, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining the year of change. When compared with data from Lianjia and LiDAR point cloud, our height reconstruction method showed impressive accuracy, with R2 values of 0.9773 and 0.9526, respectively. Analysis of summer and winter LST values revealed distinct temperature patterns across different building heights, with mid-rise buildings exhibiting the highest LST in summer and low-rise buildings registering the highest LST in winter. During periods of urban growth, both mean and amplitude values of LST increased, while during urban renewal (demolition), they decreased. The date of annual temperature peaks advanced during urban growth but delayed during urban renewal (demolition). Our time series analysis framework offers a new method for understanding the yearly dynamics of urban form and its influence on surface temperature, with potential applications in carbon emission and urban climate modeling studies."

 Well-facilitated farmland (WFF) construction is greatly responsible for agricultural sustainable development. How to quantitatively plan the WFF construction distribution and schedule is still challenging. This study thus introduced a simple but robust method, and took the typical dryland Yulin city to spatially identify its potential WFF construction areas and temporally determine construction priorities based on public data. By integrating satellite-observed croplands with survey-based statistical data, this study firstly obtained density maps of constant croplands. We found that constant cropland densities decreased from west to east in Yulin city. Jingbian and Dingbian counties of the west gave relatively dense distributions. Secondly, by overlaying evaluation indictors of WFF construction, we found over 96% of constant croplands had WFF construction potentials. Slope and fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) showed evidently spatial differences, which comprehensively reflected the potentials and difficulties of WFF construction. Therefore, an index SF, by considering normalized slope and FVC, was subsequently introduced to rank potential WFF construction priorities. According to the completion ratio and the assumption that giving priorities to develop better basic condition regions, batches of WFF construction areas were identified under the equal proportion planning scenario for each county (S1). Besides, a scenario of city-wide unified planning (S2) was also discussed. WFF construction areas in S2 were further concentrated in northwestern counties compared to those in S1. Both scenarios recommended that construction priorities were given to northwestern counties. This study could provide valuable references for arranging distributions and schedules of WFF construction."

 Understanding spatial interactions in urban environments has become critical in the context of spatio-temporal big data. However, Spatial–temporal big data often exhibit non-uniformity, necessitating the imputation of spatial interaction relationships derived from the analysis of such data. Previous studies often used simplified grid-based or TAZ approaches that ignore the complex interactions for spatial interaction imputation, leading to limitations in accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a two-layer spatial interaction imputation framework (SIF) for accurate multi-scale spatial interaction imputation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that we impute spatial interactions in multi-scale urban areas. In the first layer, it utilised a hierarchical spatial units division algorithm inspired by Shannon’s information entropy to hierarchically classify study area using point of interest (POI) data; In the second layer, it integrates the classified areas and travel flow data into a spatial interaction graph convolutional network (SI-GCN) for spatial interaction imputation. Two case studies were conducted in Beijing, China and New York City, USA, using over eight million taxi data and one million bike-sharing data.

 Automatic 3D reconstruction from spaceborne charge-coupled device (CCD) optical imagery is still a challenge as the rational functional model (RFM) based reconstruction pipeline failed to amount to the advances of pinhole based approaches in computer vision and photogrammetry. As a consequence, the accuracy and completeness of the reconstructed surface by RFM based pipeline improved slightly recent years. Though the perspective camera approximation model was explored to convert the RFM to pinhole model, it could hardly guarantee the reconstruction accuracy due to the re-projection error introduced when approximating the linear push broom camera to perspective camera. Hence, we present a refined equivalent pinhole model (REPM) for 3D reconstruction from spaceborne CCD imagery. We initially investigated the aspects that influence the re-projection error thru mathematical induction and discovered that the image size and height range of the captured area are the two key factors. To ensure the performance of the 3D reconstruction while minimizing the re-projection error, we explored the optimal image size to crop large-scale image with, while alleviated the height range effect on the image space by re-projecting the cropped images to be closed to the pseudo-image that is captured by the approximated perspective camera. The above-mentioned improvements are implemented in an image partition module and an image geometric correction module respectively, and are encompassed in the proposed REPM-based 3D reconstruction pipeline. We conducted extensive experiments on different images covering various areas from different linear-array CCD sensors to verify the proposed approach. The results indicate that our pipeline can achieve higher accuracy and completeness and exhibits great potential. The implementation of the pipeline is available at here."

 Mapping water bodies from remotely sensed imagery is crucial for understanding hydrological and biogeochemical processes. The identification of water extent is mainly dependent on optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, the use of remote sensing for water body mapping is often undermined by the mixed pixel dilemma inherent to traditional hard classification approaches. At the same time, the presence of clouds in optical imagery and speckle noise in SAR imagery, coupled with the difficulty in differentiating between water-like surfaces and actual water bodies, significantly compromise the accuracy of water body identification. This paper proposes a DEEP feature collaborative convolutional neural network (CNN) for Water Super-Resolution Mapping based on Optical and SAR images (DeepOSWSRM), which collaboratively leverages Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery to address the challenges of missing data and mixed pixels. The Sentinel-1 image provides complementary water distribution information for the cloudy areas of the Sentinel-2 image, while the Sentinel-2 image enhances the perception capabilities for small water bodies in the Sentinel-1 image. Using PlanetScope imagery as the true reference data, the effectiveness of the proposed method was assessed through two experimental scenarios: one utilizing synthetic coarse-resolution imagery degraded from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and another using actual Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, encompassing both simulated and real cloud conditions. A comparative analysis was conducted against three state-of-the-art CNN-based water mapping methods and two CNN SRM methods. The findings demonstrate that the proposed DeepOSWSRM method successfully produces accurate, fine-resolution water body maps, with its performance mainly benefiting from the fusion of SAR and optical images."

 Land surface emissivity (LSE) is a crucial variable in thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, providing unique information about the land surface across different channels. It is essential for applications such as surface energy budget estimation, resource exploration, and land cover change monitoring. However, current methods for retrieving LSE have certain limitations in terms of applicability or accuracy levels. Furthermore, the relative importance of various parameters in LSE retrieval studies remains unclear. To address these challenges, a practical and transferrable method has been proposed to retrieve LSE of different TIR channels using machine-learning technique. The proposed method uses visible and near-infrared (VNIR) as well as short-wave infrared (SWIR) data at the pixel scale to analyze key parameters for LSE retrieval and to estimate LSE for channels centered around 8.6 μm, 11.0 μm and 12.0 μm. Importance analysis identified crucial variables for LSE retrieval, including reflectivity in channels of SWIR3 (∼2.13 μm), RED (∼0.66 μm) and BLUE (∼0.47 μm), as well as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and the view zenith angle (VZ). Compared to the data used in existing methods, the core variables offer a more comprehensive representation of surface information, potentially enhancing both the accuracy and usability of the proposed method. Using these core variables, LSE was retrieved across eleven study areas through a machine learning method. Cross-validation with MODIS products showed that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the estimated LSE is 0.02 for the channel around 8.6 μm, and 0.01 for the channels around 11.0 μm and 12.0 μm, respectively. Direct-validation with in-situ measurements also demonstrated impressive retrieval accuracies in sandy areas. Furthermore, the model trained using 2019 data exhibited high retrieval accuracy when applied to data from 2017, highlighting its transferability across different time periods. Additionally, the proposed method produced promising results for LSE estimation using Landsat 8 imageries, indicating its potential for generating emissivity products from satellites with high spatial resolution but limited TIR channels."

 Detecting soil arsenic (As) contamination is crucial for designing efficient soil remediation strategies; however, traditional laboratory-based As detection techniques are time- and labour-intensive and are unsuitable for large-scale spatial analyses. To address this issue, we combined machine learning (ML) with visible-near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy to develop an efficient framework for As detection in soil. The optimal spectral preprocessing method was determined, and eight ML models were compared. The support vector classifier achieved optimal performance after subsequent hyperparameter tuning, with area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy values of 0.89 and 0.83, respectively. Important spectral bands at 471 and 2422 nm were identified by permutation importance and correspond to Fe-oxide and carbonate, respectively. These two wavelengths were included in the partial dependence plot (PDP), revealing that the likelihood of soil As contamination decreased with increasing reflectance at wavelengths of 471 and 2422 nm due to a decrease in Fe-oxide and carbonate content. Consistent with this finding, two-way PDP analysis revealed that the As content of soil increased with increasing Fe-oxide and carbonate content. The model’s classification performance was further improved using an ensemble technique based on three optimal ML models, resulting in increased AUC and accuracy values of 0.9 and 0.83, respectively.

 High-quality land-use/land-cover mapping with optical remote sensing images yet presents significant work. Even though fully convolutional semantic segmentation models have recently contributed to popular solutions, the lack of annotation data may lead to severe degradations in their inference performance.

It is formulated with a consistency self-training procedure where a dynamic class-balanced threshold selection scheme is proposed to provide high-confident pseudo supervisions for each category. In addition, we introduce pixel-wise contrastive learning on the common embedding space from both labeled and unlabeled data domains to further facilitate the semantic dependencies among category features, in which the reliable labels are leveraged as guidance for pixel sample selection.

The polarimetric orientation angles (POAs) of built-up areas exhibit diversity, and built-up areas with POA close to 45° are often misclassified as vegetation. To address this problem, a polarimetric feature suitable for the extraction of built-up areas with large POAs is first designed, and a mixed real-complex-valued polarimetric feature combination is constructed.

 Agricultural drought threatens food security and agricultural sustainable development. There have been numerous spectral indices from remote sensing images developed for monitoring crop drought. However, most present spectral indices are focusing on crop growth and Land Surface Temperature (LST), and the crop canopy water content are in less consideration simultaneously. Additionally, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used for characterizing crop growth in almost all spectral drought indices, with the spectral saturation problem of NDVI for closed crop canopy. When vegetation cover is high, NDVI values tend to saturate, which makes them insensitive to further changes in crop health. Therefore, the NDVI saturation phenomenon may lead to an underestimation of the extent of crop drought, as it is not effective in identifying subtle changes in crops under high-density vegetation conditions. Hence, we propose three novel triangular spectral indices for characterizing winter wheat drought using three features including LAI, Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and LST. For validating the proposed spectral indices, we compared the agreement between these indices with measured Relative Soil Moisture (RSM) and Volumetric Water Content (VWC) of soil in agricultural meteorological station and present popular indices including Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Temperature-Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). The results revealed that our proposed indices including Euclidean distance Crop Health Index (ECHI), Difference Crop Health Index (DCHI) and Perpendicular Water Stress Index (PWSI) outperformed the popular CWSI, TVDI and VHI, with stronger correlations with measured RSM and VWC in agricultural meteorological station. Secondly, there are spatial consistencies for characterizing winter wheat drought between proposed ECHI, DCHI and PWSI with popular CWSI, TVDI and VHI. In addition, our proposed ECHI, DCHI and PWSI have achieved good performance of drought monitoring both in irrigated and rainfed croplands. All these results suggest that our proposed indices have great potential in crop drought monitoring."

 Satellite-based field delineation has entered a quasi-operational stage due to recent advances in machine learning for computer vision. Transfer learning allows for the resource-efficient transfer of pre-trained field delineation models across heterogeneous geographies. However, the scarcity of labeled data for complex and dynamic smallholder landscapes remains a major bottleneck. The key innovation of this study is to overcome this challenge by using pre-trained models to generate sparse (i.e., not fully annotated) field delineation pseudo-labels for fine-tuning models across geographies and sensor characteristics. We build on a FracTAL ResUNet trained for crop field delineation in India (median field size of 0.24 ha) based on multi-spectral imagery at 1.5 m spatial resolution. We use this model to generate pseudo-labels for the use in Northern Mozambique (median field size of 0.06 ha) based on sub-meter resolution true-color satellite imagery. We designed multiple pseudo-label selection strategies based on field-level probability scores and compared the quantities, area properties, seasonal distribution, and spatial agreement of the pseudo-labels against human-annotated training labels (n = 1,512). We then used the human-annotated labels and the pseudo-labels for model fine-tuning and compared predictions against human field annotations (n = 2,199). We evaluated performance with regards to object-level spatial agreement and site-level field size estimation. Our results indicate i) a good baseline performance of the pre-trained model in both field delineation (mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.634) and field size estimation (mean root mean squared error (mRMSE) of 0.071 ha), and ii) the added value of regional fine-tuning with performance improvements in nearly all experiments (mIoU increases of up to 0.060, mRMSE decreases of up to 0.034 ha). Moreover, we found iii) substantial performance increases when using only pseudo-labels (up to 77 % of the mIoU increases and 68 % of the mRMSE decreases obtained by human-annotated labels), and iv) additional performance increases (mIoU+0.008, mRMSE: −0.003 ha) when complementing human annotations with pseudo-labels. Pseudo-labels are architecture-agnostic, can be efficiently generated at scale, and thus facilitate domain adaptation in label-scarce settings. The workflow presented here is a stepping stone for overcoming the persisting challenges in mapping heterogeneous smallholder agriculture."

 The dynamics of surface water in the Yangtze Plain is complex, influenced by the coupled impacts of climate change and intensifying human activities. However, remote sensing observations often encounter challenges in this region due to persistent cloud cover, impeding comprehensive studies of water dynamics. This study introduces a novel Monthly Surface Water Mapping (MSWM) approach combining time series Sentinel-1&2 images, resulting in the generation of a Monthly Surface Water Extent (MSWE) dataset. This dataset boasts a spatial resolution of 10 m and a temporal resolution of one month. Validation results indicate the MSWE exhibits a significant improvement of 19.6 % and 8.9 % in F1 score compared to the temporally-aligned Global Surface Water dataset and thresholding results, respectively. The MSWE demonstrates robust spatial precision and temporal tracking capabilities, even in complex scenes and cloudy conditions. The seasonal fluctuation of surface water bodies in the Yangtze Plain was computed using the monthly dataset and a harmonic analysis model. The results characterized distinct monthly change patterns for surface water extent, allowing for the identification and quantification of four lake classes: 6 seasonal lakes, 11 weak seasonal lakes, 21 generally stable lakes, and 46 stable lakes. The MSWM stands out for its capacity to estimate surface water extent regardless of weather conditions, showcasing promising potential for extension to other regions characterized by constant cloud cover. Furthermore, the availability of a monthly water dataset contributes significantly to enhancing our spatiotemporal understanding of surface water dynamics, offering substantial benefits for sustainable water resources management."

 The determination of river velocity is important for hydromorphological analyses and river monitoring systems. Indirect measurements of river velocity using videos recorded by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) allow fast and cost-effective processing of information about the river stretch. This paper presents a method for computing flow velocity of the river surface using deep supervised model RAFT to determine the optical flow in combination with image pre-processing by convolutional operations. Moreover, the windiness coefficients and variance score were proposed to evaluate reliability of the collected data and the obtained results of optical flow detection. Various image pre-processing techniques were applied, namely the selection of the analysed area and the number of convolutional operations to select the one with the lowest variance score. This score represents the consistency of the river flow velocity during the video and can be used to filter out unreliable results. The numerical experiments were performed using the videos and directly measured velocity values of 4 shallow rivers in Lithuania collected during the field surveys. The optical velocity estimation method showed good correspondence to the directly measured values for the velocity range from 0 m/s to 0.8 m/s in the points with low variance score up to 0.192 that represents the first quartile of the variance. The optical flow method tends to underestimate the velocity up to 0.5 m/s for the quartiles with the higher variance scores. It was shown that in most cases the lowest variance score value was obtained using pre-processing techniques without convolutional operations. However, the need to analyse various pre-processing techniques arises from the different origin of the objects moving on the river surface."

 The launch of GEDI opens a new era of forest structure monitoring using full-waveform LiDAR from space. Simulation of GEDI waveform is of great importance for the algorithm design and forest structure metric estimation. DART is a universal 3D radiative transfer model for simulating remote sensing signals by modeling light propagation in 3D landscape, with DART-RC adopting forward ray tracing and DART-Lux adopting bidirectional path tracing to model multi-mode multi-platform LiDAR signals. GEDI simulator is a semi-empirical model for simulating GEDI waveform with point clouds. In view of their different solutions, this study aims to evaluate and inter-compare the accuracy of DART-RC, DART-Lux, and GEDI simulator for simulating GEDI waveforms in forests. Because there are possible geolocation errors and 3D modeling uncertainty in real forests, we propose to adopt virtual forests (turbid medium, RAMI scenes) for consistency evaluation and real forests for accuracy evaluation. Metrics including R2 (coefficient of determination), RMSD (root mean square deviation), RMSE (root mean square error), and bias were calculated from the normalized waveform intensities from different simulation methods.According to the results, it is demonstrated that DART-RC/Lux, when only considering first order scattering, can simulate waveforms that are highly consistent compared to GEDI simulator in virtual forests. In real forests, DART-RC/Lux which considers first order and multiple scattering can simulate more accurate waveforms than GEDI simulator in sparse canopies (ePAI < 1.2). The median R2 were 0.935, 0.928, 0.898 and the median RMSE were 0.035, 0.037, 0.044, for DART-RC, DART-Lux and GEDI simulator respectively. However, GEDI simulator slightly outperforms DART-RC/Lux in dense canopies (ePAI > 1.2). The challenge in accurate forest 3D modeling is the most likely reason causing decreasing accuracy of DART-RC/Lux in dense forests. We recommend the use of GEDI simulator when airborne point cloud is available, while the use of DART-RC and DART-Lux for mechanism studies or theoretical analysis. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of LiDAR waveform simulation methodologies in forests."

 Accurately estimating fractional cover of vegetated ecosystems over large areas is essential for many scientific studies, including climate change, land cover and land use, etc. Taking both accuracy and large spatial coverage into account, different methods have been proposed, such as upscaling from high to low spatial resolution remote sensing images, and harmonized data from varied sources. In this work, a new method, called centroid-based endmember optimization (CEO), is proposed to assist endmember selection for fractional cover estimation using the triangular space method. The basic idea is to retrieve endmembers from a triangular space built on a fine spatial resolution image, then correct and apply them to a coarse spatial resolution image. The method is discussed and tested using Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI images to estimate non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), photosynthetic vegetation (PV), and bare soil (BS) fractional cover. With CEO, the fractional cover of an OLCI image can be estimated more accurately, reducing the work of mosaicking MSI images to acquire fractional cover of the same large area. The premises that CEO can be applied effectively are: (1) the acquisition dates of the MSI and OLCI images are close, ensuring a similar land cover; and (2) the spatial overlap between the MSI and OLCI images covers enough NPV, PV, and BS endmembers. When taken the average fractional cover retrieved from an MSI image as truth value, the CEO method reduced the estimation difference to 0.7%, compared to the differences of 8.1% and 6.6% retrieved using uncorrected or incompletely corrected triangular space method of an OLCI image, respectively. In addition to the average fractional cover estimation, the histogram of fractional cover distribution also improved obviously. When applying CEO to a full OLCI image, two full MSI images covering different locations were used for fractional cover validation, which supported a robust estimation result."

 The Jamuna is a major braided river of Bangladesh and poses enormous challenges related to flooding, erosion, and sedimentation. Effective river management requires an understanding of the Jamuna’s sediment transport dynamics and channel morphology. Yet, developing that understanding is hindered by a lack of topographic data for the river corridor. In this study, the waterline method was applied to a 65 km reach of the Jamuna to derive river channel and floodplain topography above the low water level. The analysis relies on surface water detection from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, along with in-situ water level observations, to generate river-floodplain DEMs for the years 2016–2019. Morphologic change was assessed through DEMs of difference for sequential years and for the overall study period. A quantitative uncertainty analysis was conducted to characterize errors in the waterline DEMs, vertical change detection, and gross and net volumetric changes. The results indicate that gross annual erosion and accretion volumes have a similar order of magnitude to contemporary estimates of the river’s sediment influx. The study highlights that localized and reach-scale lateral exchange is a key component of the overall sediment budget.

 The molybdenum (Mo) isotope budget of the surface environment has been well characterized in recent decades, facilitating accurate mass balance modeling of the ancient redox-driven Mo cycle. One yet unresolved component is the range of possible processes and sources that result in isotopically heavy river waters relative to continental sources. Following a recent hypothesis that isotopically heavy δ98Mo of precipitation may control the final δ98Mo of river water relative to its continental source bedrock, we investigated the δ98Mo composition of 19 snow samples from three locations in Central Europe: the Swiss Alps (“Alpine” samples) from the Hochalpine Forschungsstation Jungfraujoch (HFSJ) in both summer and winter, the Swiss Jura Mountains in winter and the French Vosges Mountains in winter. Stream waters from two snowmelt-fed streams were additionally collected from the Alpine site. Snow sample δ98Mo compositions were highly variable, ranging from −0.03 to +1.93 ‰, with no clear mixing trends indicating complex sources, source pathways, or post-depositional processing. Only the winter snow samples from the high-altitude HFSJ site had δ98Mo values consistently heavier than typical continental crust. The δ98Mo results were coupled with radiogenic Sr isotopic, major ion, and trace element compositions as tracers for three major sources of airborne ion inputs: sea salt, mineral dust, and anthropogenic aerosols. We found that the most likely source of Mo to precipitation in the lower elevation Vosges and Jura Mountains samples was isotopically light soil mineral dust, which reflected the underlying bedrock sources, with a likely additional anthropogenic component. The isotopically heavy winter snow samples at the elevated HFSJ site were attributed to a higher input of carbonate mineral dust from long-distance transport of carbonate-rich Saharan dust, which was overwritten in the summer by an influx of low elevation sources transported upwards during higher vertical thermal mixing. Finally, we concluded that precipitation has a negligible direct effect on the overall Mo content and isotopic composition of inner continental European streams and rivers relative to other sources, such as bedrock weathering. Future time-series studies may augment these conclusions to show possible heterogeneity of precipitation as well as the addition of sample sites closer to marine sources, where a larger flux of isotopically heavy marine aerosols to streams might be expected."

 The coal chemical industry produces a large amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the emission characteristics and associated impact on the environment and health of the residents are still unclear. This study determined the VOC concentrations and compositions in the Jinjie Coal Chemical Industry Park which is located in northern China. The average concentrations of total measured VOCs (TVOCs) in the industrial areas in summer and winter were 231.5 and 103.2 μg/m3, which were higher than those in the residential areas (123.7 and 70.3 μg/m3), respectively. Aromatics, Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), and alkanes were the dominant VOC classes in the industrial areas, while halocarbons, OVOCs, and alkenes had higher compositions in the residential areas where were not only affected by industrial emissions and also other anthropogenic sources. OVOCs contributed over 43% of ozone formation potential (OFP), while aromatics contributed over 61% of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in the Park in both seasons. Using the source apportionment method, biogenic emission and anthropogenic source (gasoline production, coking emission, fuel combustion, solvent coating, and vehicle exhaust) were major contributors to VOCs in residential areas. The industrial-related emissions were the main components of anthropogenic source, accounting for 53.5%–58.7% of the overall VOCs. With reliable estimations of the health aspects, exposures to acrolein (HQ: 7.4–126.6) and formaldehyde (ILCR: 5.5 × 10−3-5.7 × 10−2) posed the highest non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, accounting for 94.3%–98.6% and 55.8%–93.8% of the total HQ and ILCR, respectively. The results demonstrated that substantial environmental and health co-benefits to the residents could be achieved by reducing the industrial emissions from gasoline production, coking process, and diesel-fueled vehicles in the Jinjie Coal Chemical Industry Park. Prioritizing the establishment of efficient air pollution measures and tightening industrial emission standards, especially for hazardous VOCs, are recommended according to the findings of the valuable work."

 Arising from the Chemical Assessment of Surfaces and Air (CASA) 2022 study at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF), this paper presents the first evaluation of indoor surface emissions to a house measured with a surface flux chamber coupled to an online, non-targeted volatile organic compound (VOC) mass spectrometric detection. These surface emissions are compared to those assessed using ambient, whole house indoor VOC measurements and the outdoor air change rate. Chamber emission rates varied by almost four orders of magnitude across 35 quantified VOCs. The whole house emissions measured by campaign-long ambient measurements and the flux chamber emissions (when scaled to the painted surface area of the house) are similar, with an average ratio between the two of 1.3 ± 1.0. The general agreement between these two approaches indicates that the flux chamber was not solely measuring primary emissions from building materials located below the chamber. Rather, the results suggest that over the 12-year house lifetime, VOCs have been widely distributed around the house, migrating from their primary sources to secondary surface reservoirs. With the house in a quasi-steady state, the thermodynamic activities (i.e., the vapor pressures) of the VOCs within the different reservoirs become similar. Emissions of aromatics and monoterpenes have declined since the house was built, whereas aldehyde emissions have remained relatively constant."

 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions from the vehicle refueling process is an increasingly significant issue. However, the gasoline formulation showed seasonal variation, potentially leading to the alterations of VOC components during the refueling process. Refueling VOCs of different gasoline and diesel were collected at some typical gas stations during both summer and winter to analyze their seasonal emissions characteristics, environmental impacts, and associated health risks. The refueling VOC profiles in summer consisted of a notably higher proportion of small oxygenated VOCs (C3) and a significantly lower content of halocarbons compared to those in winter, which indicated that the refueling VOC profiles in just a single season failed to capture characteristics of the entire year. The OFP values of gasoline vapor in two test seasons were consistent (around 2.9 g O3/g VOCs), with the dominant species of acrolein (15.7 ± 2.5%) in summer and i-pentane (23.2 ± 2.1%) in winter. Aromatics contributed the most to secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP), with toluene (65.4%, summer; 48.5%, winter) being the overwhelmingly dominant species. The assessment of inhalation health risks indicated that exposure to adverse VOCs resulted in definite non-cancer risk (HQ = 5.9) and cancer risk (ICR = 4.6 × 10−4) to the gas station attendant, which exceeded the acceptable level, with 1,3-butadiene exhibiting the highest toxicity and a dual toxicity risk. The impact of VOCs on health was more severe during winter compared to summer. It is recommended that seasonal influences should be considered when controlling VOC pollution at gas stations."

 The short-, medium- and long-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs) were measured in outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and gas-phases in Xi'an in spring, autumn and winter of 2021, which containing two special events during this time, the sandstorms happened in spring and the COVID-19 epidemic in winter. The CPs concentrations in PM2.5 were seasonal variated, with spring (mean: 17.5 ng/m3) > autumn (mean: 8.6 ng/m3) > winter (mean: 5.8 ng/m3). The CPs concentrations in gas phases (mean:12.6 ng/m3) were lower than in PM2.5 in spring, and it showed shorter carbon chain and lower chlorinated CPs dominated in SCCPs in gas phase (C10, Cl5,6) compared with in PM2.5 (C11, Cl6,7). The absorption was the main mechanism for the partitioning of CP in particle and gaseous phase. The shorter carbon chain CPs (C10,11, C14) with lower chlorinated (Cl6,7) CPs dominated in SCCPs and MCCPs, while the longer carbon chain (C25 or C29) with Cl6,12 dominated in the LCCPs. So, more researches about the LCCPs should be concerned. Additionally, the CPs concentrations of all samples during the sandstorms in spring were increased 30.4%–136.5% and the proportion of SCCPs was obviously elevated. CPs concentrations obviously decreased during the COVID-19 epidemic in winter, while SCCPs, MCCPs attributed comparable in autumn and winter. Potential source analysis showed that during the sandstorms in spring, atmospheric pollutants were mainly transported over a long distance from northern and northeast of Shaanxi Province, while it was mainly from local emission during the COVID-19 epidemic in winter. The health risk assessment of CPs displayed that there had no or very low inhalation exposure risks of CPs for all age groups, but the younger age groups (younger than 6 years old) should be played more attention for their not fully development of their immune and respiratory systems."

 PM2.5 can cause lung cell injury. Due to the complexity and variation of the physical and chemical properties of PM2.5, the risk of lung cell injury may depend significantly on the type of atmospheric environment. With a population of 120 million, the Chengdu-Chongqing region in China is the most populated region in the world that experiences both high humidity and low solar radiation (HHLR). However, PM2.5-related lung cell injury and treatment strategies in this type of environment are still unclear. Thus, our study focuses on the relationships between the chemical components, lung cell injury effects, and pathogenic mechanisms of PM2.5 in HHLR (HHLR-PM2.5). In terms of mass, organic carbon (OC), NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+ are found to be the most significant components of HHLR-PM2.5. Extracts of HHLR-PM2.5 significantly inhibit cell viability, stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and trigger inflammation. Utilizing a combination of multi-omics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology, it is found that HHLR-PM2.5 extracts inhibit E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (UHRF1) to suppress DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and hamper DNA methylation, culminating in lung cell injury. Additionally, integrating transcriptomic data with human disease databases highlights chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a potential lung cell injury-related respiratory affliction induced by HHLR-PM2.5.

 The concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the atmospheres above major cities in Northeast China are relatively high. Dew is an effective way to settle and remove particulate and gaseous matter in the formation process. Notably, 16-PAH concentration dew analysis was conducted in four major cities (Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian) from April to November 2023. In the study area, 2–3-ring PAHs dominated in dew in both the dissolved and particle phases, followed by 4-ring and 5–6-ring PAHs. Phe was the most common individual PAH in dew. Because PAHs in wet deposition are closely related to those in the atmosphere, the concentration of PAHs in dew was much lower than that in snow. The proportions of the gaseous-phase scavenging ratio (Wg) to the total scavenging ratio (Wt) in Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian increased with increasing temperature, reaching 22.98%, 29.02%, 30.71% and 33.22%, respectively, which indicated that the ability of dew to remove PAHs in the particle phase was greater than that to remove PAHs in the gas phase. The concentration of dissolved-phase PAHs in dew was lower than that of particle-phase PAHs. The total PAH fluxes were 43.25, 33.35, 32.16, and 25.63 ng/m2·d in Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian, respectively, decreasing from north to south. The dew amount was much smaller than the rainfall and snow amount (by two orders of magnitude), and the PAH flux in dew was much lower than that in rain and snow. Isomeric ratio assessment coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the source of PAHs in dew was a combination of vehicle emissions and biomass and coal combustion. PAHs in dew mainly originated from local sources rather than from long-range atmospheric transport. This study revealed the effects of PAHs in dew on the air quality and the removal of PAHs by dew."

 Advanced machine learning models have recently achieved high predictive accuracy for weather and climate prediction. However, these complex models often lack inherent transparency and interpretability, acting as “black boxes” that impede user trust and hinder further model improvements. As such, interpretable machine learning techniques have become crucial in enhancing the credibility and utility of weather and climate modeling. In this paper, we review current interpretable machine learning approaches applied to meteorological predictions. We categorize methods into two major paradigms: (1) Post-hoc interpretability techniques that explain pre-trained models, such as perturbation-based, game theory based, and gradient-based attribution methods. (2) Designing inherently interpretable models from scratch using architectures like tree ensembles and explainable neural networks. We summarize how each technique provides insights into the predictions, uncovering novel meteorological relationships captured by machine learning.

10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107733,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了气温、气湿对PM2.5和PM10浓度的影响，以及不同空气质量指数(AQI)区域这种影响的差异。研究选取了三个不同AQI等级(极差、中等和良好)的九个地点，进行了多次测量，并使用Spearman相关系数分析了气象条件与PM2.5和PM10浓度之间的关系。结果表明，气象条件与PM2.5和PM10浓度之间的关系取决于AQI等级，不同等级区域的相关性强度和方向有所不同。例如，在中等AQI区域，温度与PM2.5和PM10浓度呈负相关，湿度呈正相关；而在极差AQI区域，湿度与PM2.5和PM10浓度之间没有观察到关系。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它关注的是地面空气质量监测，并分析了气象因素对PM2.5和PM10浓度的影响，这与利用遥感技术进行大气成分分析和空气质量监测的目标一致。虽然论文中没有直接提及卫星观测或特定传感器，但其研究结果可以为改进空气质量模型和预测提供数据支持，并为环境遥感技术的应用提供参考。,"['Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10)', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Air Quality Index (AQI)', 'Meteorological Conditions (Temperature, Humidity)', 'Ground-based Sensors', 'Correlation Analysis']",E.

Starzomska,The effect of temperature and humidity of air on the concentration of particulate matter - PM2.5 and PM10,"•The concentration of PM2.5, PM10 is more strongly dependent on the air humidity than on the temperature. •The correlation between PM2.5, PM10 concentration, and temperature is different for location with respect to AQI. •The correlation between PM2.5, PM10 concentration, and humidity is different for location with respect to AQI. 
 Particulate matters accepted as air quality markers are also indicators of the health risk of the population, especially children, because of their increased susceptibility to the quality of the air they breathe. Understanding the correlations between the concentration of particulate matter in the outdoor air and meteorological conditions will help to take steps to reduce pollution and reduce the risk of threats to health and life. For many years, scientists from all over the world have been looking for relationship between the impact of meteorological conditions on the concentration of particulate matter. Despite this, it is still not known whether the relationships will be similar in all locations. Furthermore, there is no agreement among scientists on the direction and strength of the correlation between temperature, humidity, and particulate matter concentrations. The article presents an attempt to link the impact of meteorological conditions on particulate matter concentrations depending on the classification of the area into air quality index in the particulate matter (AQIPM) category. Three locations with a specific air quality index were included: extremely poor, moderate & fair and good. The research was carried out at nine locations near educational facilities. Four measurement series were carried out for each location. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship with an assumed significance level of 0.05. A research hypothesis was adopted: The correlation between particulate matter and meteorological conditions is different in locations with different AQIPM. The results obtained clearly show that the relationships between meteorological conditions and the concentration of particulate matter depend on the classification of the area into a specific category of the air quality index. The strongest correlation occurs in the fair & moderate AQIPM area. In relation to temperature, there is a negative correlation, and in relation to humidity, positive. In the extremely poor AQIPM area, no relationship was observed between humidity and particulate matter concentration. In the good AQIPM area, the correlation in relation to temperature was very weak, in relation to humidity, weak."

 This study analyzes the performance of the Climate–Weather Research and Forecasting (CWRF) model in predicting the summer temperature and precipitation in northwestern China (NWC) for the 1991–2021 period. It also examines the improvements in prediction resulting from the implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) downscaling methods. The results indicate that the CWRF model demonstrates reasonable ability in capturing the characteristics of climatological temperature and precipitation in NWC. Both the climatological temperature and precipitation predictions consistently demonstrate a systematic underestimation, revealing evident biases in regions characterized by complex terrain. In terms of interannual variation, the temperature prediction outperforms the precipitation prediction, whereas there is no significant difference in the temperature predictions for lead Months 1–3. However, uncertainties increase as the lead time is extended in precipitation prediction. Therefore, the combination of dynamical and statistical downscaling is employed to the summer temperature and precipitation prediction over NWC. It is shown both the CNN and LSTM downscaling methods can improve the prediction ability of the CWRF model for summer climatological temperature and precipitation. The LSTM method significantly reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of precipitation and temperature predictions, indicating an improvement in predicting the spatial structure. At the interannual scale, the CNN method is less dependent on the lead time of prediction than the LSTM method is, and the interannual correlation coefficient of precipitation and temperature is greater than 0.1 compared with that of the raw CWRF model. These results provide valuable insights into understanding the prediction capabilities of the CWRF model in NWC and highlight the necessity of applying downscaling methods to the CWRF model to increase its prediction ability."

 The study explores Hurricane Michael's impact on Hurricane Leslie's trajectory predictability using ECMWF and NCEP ensemble systems. A clustering method focused on tropical cyclones is used to identify potential paths for Leslie: Cluster 1 accurately predicted Leslie's direction towards the Iberian Peninsula, whereas Clusters 2 and 3 indicated a southern recurve near the Canary Islands. Analysis of potential vorticity and irrotational wind at upper levels showed a significant interaction between Michael, ridge, and trough across the jet stream from +12 h after initialization. Cluster 1 showed a stronger Michael promoting upper-level wind divergence greatest, modifying the jet stream configuration around the ridge and downstream. Alterations in the jet stream's configuration, functioning as a waveguide, propagated downstream, guiding Leslie towards the Iberian Peninsula. Clusters 2 and 3 indicated the trough's failure to incorporate Leslie, resulting in a recurve of the trajectory around the Azores anticyclone. This research enhances comprehension of the interaction between two tropical cyclones via synoptic Rossby wave flow. Moreover, the conceptual framework can aid operational meteorologists in identifying the sources of uncertainty, particularly in track forecasts under synoptic conditions analogous to those examined in this study."

 This study addresses snow depth overestimation and temperature underestimation in the WRF/Noah-MP regional climate model by producing eight sensitivity simulations at a 10 km grid spacing for the 2001–2006 period, driven by the ERA5 reanalysis. The experiments differ either in the parameterization of snow-related processes within the Noah-MP land surface model, the physical parameterization schemes of the atmospheric model (planetary boundary layer, surface layer, microphysics), or the WRF model version (v4.2 or v4.3, with the latter incorporating snow-related code enhancements). The best-performing configuration is further tested by conducting a hindcast simulation spanning an extended climatological period (1985–2010). The study area includes parts of Western, Central, and Eastern Europe, focusing on the Carpathian Basin. Snow depth is evaluated using in situ observations from low-elevation stations and ERA5 reanalysis data. Temperature and precipitation biases are assessed using the CARPATCLIM dataset, consisting of gridded surface meteorological observations. With the appropriate choice of physical parameterizations in the WRF/Noah-MP model, the median snow depth bias is reduced from 3.4 cm/day to 0.7 cm/day across all stations during the 2001–2006 period (November to March), with a corresponding decrease in RMSE from 8.4 to 3.9 cm/day and an increase in the correlation coefficient from 0.68 to 0.82. Concurrently, the underestimation of average daily minimum temperatures decreases from 2.5 °C to 1.6 °C over a plain subregion within the Carpathian Basin. Further efforts are required to eliminate the cold bias above snow cover in the WRF/Noah-MP model. The results suggest that exploring sensitivities to physical processes within the land surface scheme is equally important as testing different physical parameterizations in the atmospheric model itself."

 The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration(BTH) has successively witnessed the extraordinary precipitation extremes (PEs) with huge economic losses and death-toll in the recent decade. To timely and comprehensively understand the PEs in the urban agglomeration, we investigate the characteristic and mechanism of PEs variation based on six extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) including maximum daily precipitation(Rx1day), maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation(Rx5day), total precipitation with daily precipitation more than the 95th percentile (R95P), average daily precipitation on wet days (SDII), heavy precipitation days(R25) and very heavy precipitation days(R50).

 Snowfall is a critical component of the Earth system and an important indicator and amplifier of climate change. Climate warming is reducing the seasonal snowpack globally, which could have catastrophic consequences for the regions in high dependence on snow for water recharge. However, the climate influences on extreme snowfall events, which significantly impact humans, are still poorly understood. This study uses the Tibetan Plateau snowpack observation dataset combined with NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6) climate data to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of snowfall, and to explore its response mechanism to climate change and future change trends across the Lower Yarlung Zangbo River (LYZR) in Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP). Annual snowfall decreased at a rate of 1.05 mm per decade (P < 0.05) during the historical period (1960–2014). Relative to 1960–2014, annual snowfall would decline of ∼38 % and ∼ 73 % by the end of the 21st century under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. At the same time, a general decrease in extreme snowfall averaged the LYZR is expected for historical and future periods, but it showed notable spatial variations. The regional increase in extreme snowfall is mainly distributed along the valley of Brahmaputra-Yarlung Zangbo. In addition, precipitation accounted for 66.5 % of the snowfall variations during the historical period. Meanwhile, according to future warming, temperature would dominate snowfall variations, contributing 56.66 % to 72.92 % during 2015–2100. The projected response of mean and extreme snowfall to climate change indicates that it is a double-edged sword. To scientifically address the risks and challenges posed by snowfall changes in alpine regions, it is imperative to limit future climate warming."

 In this study, spatial and temporal variations of spring compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) over northern Asia (NA) during 1950–2020 and the related possible mechanisms are investigated on the interannual timescale. The standardized compound event indicator (SCEI) is used to represent compound dry and hot conditions over NA, which is validated by the observed summer case of CDHEs over western Russia in 2010. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF1) mode of the SCEI over NA presents a monopole pattern, while the EOF2 mode shows an east-west dipole pattern. Possible mechanism analysis indicates that the CDHEs tend to be modulated by local high-pressure anomalies, accompanied by reduced cloud cover and more solar radiation. The high-pressure anomalies can lead to warm temperature and water vapor divergence, which synergistically contributes to the occurrence of CDHEs. Further analysis shows that the EOF1 mode is jointly affected by the Scandinavian (SCAND) pattern and the Arctic Oscillation (AO); while the EOF2 mode is influenced by the Atlantic-Eurasian (AEA) teleconnection. Moreover, the North Atlantic tripolar pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) can influence the EOF1 mode through changing the AO. And the diagonal tripolar SST pattern over the North Atlantic affects the EOF2 mode via altering the AEA pattern.

 The climatic disparities between urban cores and surrounding rural areas have become increasingly pronounced due to rapid urbanization. The vapor pressure deficit (VPD) serves as a critical meteorological indicator reflecting atmospheric aridity, and identifying the contributions of urban and rural climate factors on the urban-rural VPD disparities plays an important role in understanding urban climate and ecosystem development patterns. This study introduces a quantitative method, utilizing partial differential equations, to assess the relative contributions of two crucial meteorological factors—air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH)—toward urban-rural differences in VPD. Analyzing daily scale data from 116 pairs of urban and rural stations across mainland China for the period 2000–2017, we derived several key findings: Urban areas generally exhibit higher VPD than surrounding rural areas, with a relative difference in annual VPD of about 21.6 %, and the disparity increases over time. Furthermore, the influence of urbanization on VPD responds differently across seasons and geographical conditions. The simulated trends in VPD urban-rural differences using the partial differential method align closely with the actual observed trends, validating the effectiveness of our quantitative analysis approach. The VPD urban-rural disparity shows greater sensitivity to shifts in RH, with sensitivity coefficients exceeding 1.5 times to changes in T in most cases. RH is the primary factor causing VPD urban-rural differences in mainland China, and the relative contribution of RH is about 2.5 times of T. The patterns of sensitivity and the contribution of factors exhibit notable variation among subregions. This study enhances the understanding of how urbanization affects regional climate and provides insights for assessing the environmental impacts of future urban expansion."

 This study explores the uncertainty of future summer warming over Iberia using storylines constructed from climate model simulations of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Unlike prior storyline approaches focusing on remote drivers and global teleconnections of atmospheric circulation, we use regional factors that directly influence summer temperatures: ridging activity, soil moisture and Mediterranean sea surface temperature. These drivers explain a substantial portion of the observed variability across climate models, with ridging activity and soil moisture showing the strongest influence on Iberian warming. Under a high radiative forcing scenario (SSP5–8.5), the storylines of Iberian warming based on these two drivers range between 7 and 9 °C for the end of the 21st century. The storyline leading to the largest warming is characterised by a drying out of the soil conditions and an increase in the anticyclonic activity over Iberia. We find similar conclusions for simple extreme heat indicators, though the approach struggles with more complex heatwave metrics. We also propose a novel modification of the storyline approach to increase the data sample of climate responses by using different time intervals throughout the 21st century. This modification would allow the application of more complex statistical models, the exploration of non-linear relationships and the identification of other drivers shaping the regional climate projections."

 Tropical cyclone (TC) Khanun in 2017 was simulated in this study by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The observation-validated simulation data were used to examine how asymmetric rotational and environmental flows played the roles in determining the contraction of the radius of maximum kinetic energy of symmetric rotational flow (Kψs). The radius of maximum Kψs was contracted rapidly before rapid intensification (RI) and moved inward slowly, then barely moved, and moved inward slowly again during RI.The conversion from kinetic energy of asymmetric rotational flow (Kψa) to Kψs was induced by advection of asymmetric rotational tangential wind by asymmetric divergent radial wind. The conversion and convergence of inward flux of Kψs led to the rapid contraction before RI. During RI, in additional to horizontal and vertical flux convergence of Kψs, the conversion from environmental kinetic energy (Ke) to Kψs through the interaction between Kψs and symmetric radial environmental flow was important for the second slow contraction."

 To improve forecast skill of extreme weather events, it is of primary importance to construct accurate initial conditions for a convective-scale ensemble prediction system (EPS). The traditional initial perturbation schemes, e.g., dynamic downscaling, fail to capture the amplitude or structure of convective-scale forecast errors accurately, especially near steep terrain or meso- and small-scale systems during weather system's rapid change. In this study, we developed a new initial perturbation optimizing technique, namely the cosine analysis constraint method. This method is then used to improve the downscaled initial perturbations by introducing smaller-scale information from the analysis increments, generated from data assimilation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the cosine analysis constraint method in the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) convective-scale EPS. Using the control experiment (CTRL) without any modification to the initial perturbation scheme as a reference, we designed the cosine analysis constraint experiment (CONS) and compared it with CTRL. We selected a case study of convective precipitation and two groups of one-month experiments were initialized to verify the feasibility of the new method and exclude case dependence. The results of the one-month test show that adopting the cosine analysis constraint method to optimize the initial perturbations can effectively enhance the consistency between the ensemble mean and the corresponding reanalysis field (regarded as observations). In the case study, the larger horizontal distribution of precipitation spread in CONS indicated the location of convective precipitation more effectively, which is important for operational weather forecasting. The significant effect of the moisture process was confirmed, especially in CONS. The verification results of the entire study domain were significantly improved after the initial perturbations were rescaled. Overall, the forecast skill of meteorological fields at different pressure levels and the extreme precipitation of smaller-scale convective systems were enhanced, which illustrated the potential of the cosine analysis constraint method to improve the quality of initial perturbations in CMA convective-scale EPS."

 On June 25, 2020, an atypical bow echo (ATBE) accompanied by a meso-γ-scale vortex (MV) incurred the strongest gust (41.4 m s−1) recorded since 1957 in the North China Plain. In this article, we investigate the evolution characteristics of MV and its mechanism for the extreme wind by using the observation data of Doppler weather radar and automatic weather stations as well as the four-dimensional Variational Doppler Radar Analysis System (VDRAS). The results show that the MV in this process was initially born at a height of 0.9–2.4 km, and the contracting and stretching vertical vortex rapidly descended to surface from the 2.0 km height with the rotation speed increasing rapidly. Six minutes later, the extreme wind occurred. The generation mechanism of the MV is that, under the strong vertical wind shear and downdraft in the lower troposphere, the vertical vortex tube of MV was transformed from the horizontal vortex tube generated in the zone of perturbation temperature gradient. The influence mechanism of MV on the extreme wind is that, as the MV continued to intensify and extend downward, a negative perturbation low-pressure center formed in the lower troposphere near the MV. Meanwhile, the descending rear-inflow jet (RIJ) was blocked by the prefrontal upward motion and a positive perturbation high-pressure center formed at around 1 km height. The violent positive-negative couplets of perturbation pressure gradient produced a downward nonhydrostatic perturbation pressure gradient force (NPPGF) that further intensified the vertical downward velocity. In addition to the strong downdraft velocity, the Coriolis force also enhanced the formation of the extreme wind through the action of ageostrophic winds. Besides, this paper also compares the mechanism of this process with that of a typical bow echo MV and the extreme wind it affected."
