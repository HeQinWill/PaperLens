However, LWP increases for non-precipitating thick clouds, opposite to satellite-based decreases, due to excessive precipitation, moist bias in cloud-top humidity, and cloud droplet number–LWP relations from internal cloud processes, rather than aerosol-cloud interaction. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI) remain the largest source of uncertainty in model estimates of anthropogenic radiative forcing, primarily because of deficiencies in representing aerosol–cloud microphysical processes that lead to inconsistent cloud liquid water path (LWP) responses to aerosol perturbations between observations and models. To investigate this discrepancy, we conducted a series of large-eddy-scale simulations driven by realistic meteorology over the eastern North Atlantic, and evaluated LWP susceptibility, precipitation processes, and boundary layer thermodynamics using satellite and ground-based observations.Simulated LWP responses show a strong dependence on cloud state. Non-precipitating thin clouds exhibit a modest LWP decrease with increasing cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), consistent in sign but weaker in magnitude than satellite estimates, reflecting enhanced turbulent mixing and evaporation. The largest model-observation discrepancy occurs in non-precipitating thick clouds, where simulated LWP susceptibilities are strongly positive (+0.32) while observations indicate large negative values (−0.69). This discrepancy stems from excessive precipitation driven by underestimated entrainment, overly active accretion, and overly broad drop-size distributions in polluted conditions. While our high-resolution setup mitigates the excessive drizzling common in coarser models and captures key regime transitions, these biases persist – highlighting that improved parameterizations of cloud-top processes, precipitation, and aerosol effects are needed beyond simply increasing model resolution.Additionally, misrepresented moisture inversions in reanalysis introduce a moist bias in cloud-top relative humidity, further amplifying positive LWP susceptibility. Our results also suggest that large negative Nd–LWP relationships in observations may reflect internal cloud processes rather than true ACI effects."

Here we show different thermodynamic models differed in the NH4NO3 non-ideality representations, resulting in discrepancies in nitrate gas–particle partitioning predictions. The driving factors of chemical profiles and meteorological conditions are also investigated. This discrepancy can be an important source of uncertainty in air quality predictions. 
 Semi-volatile NH4NO3 is a major component of atmospheric aerosols, and its environmental and climate effects are largely regulated by the gas-particle partitioning. The activity coefficient of NH4NO3, γAN, is one key parameter controlling the gas-particle partitioning of nitrate, with lower γAN typically favouring particle-phase partitioning of nitrate. However, the γAN dependence on meteorological condition and chemical profile remains uncertain. Here we investigated into this issue with comprehensive simulations and ambient observations, based on results of three widely-used thermodynamic models, i.e. ISORROPIA, E-AIM, and AIOMFAC. Correspondingly, AIOMFAC estimate higher particle phase nitrate fp,NO3- values. Across all models, γAN2 ranges between 10−2 and 10−1, with AIOMFAC results ∼ 33 % lower than E-AIM and ISORROPIA. Correspondingly, AIOMFAC estimate higher particle phase nitrate fp,NO3- values. For all three models and all chemical profiles tested, the γAN2 correlates positively with relative humidity (RH) and temperature, and RH generally contributes larger variations. In comparison, the effect of chemical composition on γAN2 is more complex and is strongly modulated by RH, with differed dependence pattern observed at varying RH levels. Furthermore, γAN2 responds more strongly to changes of particle chemical profile in E-AIM, whereas in ISORROPIA and AIOMFAC γAN2 is more sensitive to meteorological variations. As E-AIM is typically considered as the benchmark thermodynamic model, these results suggest the potential under-representation of chemical profiles in predicting γAN2 for ISORROPIA and AIOMFAC. The corresponding influence on 3-D chemical-transport model predictions of NH4NO3 are encouraged in future studies."

N. Sansom;Jill S. Johnson;Leighton A. Regayre;Lindsay A. Lee;Ken S. Carslaw,Strong control of the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition time by aerosol: analysis of the joint roles of several cloud-controlling factors using Gaussian process emulation,"The cloud transition from stratocumulus to cumulus features a distinct decrease in cloud cover. We used a high-resolution model to simulate many instances of the transition with different environmental conditions. In low aerosol conditions, the transition occurred faster due to drizzle depleting the cloud of moisture and aerosol, whereas in high aerosol conditions, other factors were more important. Understanding different regimes is important for accurately simulating clouds in global models. 
 Stratocumulus-to-cumulus transitions are driven primarily by increasing sea-surface temperatures, with additional contributions from numerous interacting cloud-controlling factors. Understanding these interactions is important for improving the accuracy of cloud responses to changes in climate and other environmental factors in global climate models. Many studies have found lower-tropospheric stability dictates the transition time, while aerosol-focused studies found that aerosol concentration plays a key role via the drizzle-depletion mechanism. We consider the role of aerosol together with several other cloud-controlling factors representing a selection of the wider environmental conditions that affect drizzle in a clean to moderately polluted environment. A 34-member perturbed parameter ensemble of idealised large-eddy simulations with 2-moment cloud microphysics is used to train Gaussian process emulators (statistical representations) of the relationships between the factors and two properties of the transition: transition temporal length and average rain water path. We base the ensemble around a composite of trajectories in the Northeastern Pacific during summer. Using these emulators, parameter space can be densely sampled to visualise the joint and individual effects of the factors on the transition properties. We find that in the low-aerosol regime (< 200 cm−3) the transition time is most strongly affected by the aerosol concentration out of the factors considered here. Fast transitions, under 40 h, occur in this regime with high mean rain water path, which is consistent with a drizzle-depletion effect. In the high-aerosol regime, the inversion strength becomes more important than the aerosol concentration through the inversion's effect on entrainment and the deepening-warming decoupling mechanism."
10.5194/essd-18-903-2026,True,Earth System Science Data,该论文研究利用微波和光学遥感技术（如SAR和MSI传感器）估算湖泊盐度，这与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关，因此高度相关。,"['microwave', 'optical', 'salinity', 'SAR', 'MSI']",Mingming Deng;Ronghua Ma;Lixin Wang;Minqi Hu;Kun Xue;Junfeng Xiong,A lake salinity dataset produced via microwave and optical imageries,"Lake salinity is an important parameter to characterize physical and biogeochemical processes. We proposed a microwave-optical integrated framework for high-precision salinity estimation, producing a 10 m resolution Inner Mongolia Xinjiang Lake zone lake salinity dataset (2016–2024). Salinity increased significantly in Lake Daihai and Lake Dalinor. The dataset can contribute to research on salinization prevention and salinity budget research. 
 Lake salinity is an important parameter to characterize physical and biogeochemical processes and a fundamental indicator to evaluate lake water quality. However, its estimation in inland waters has been challenging because passive microwave salinity satellites lack sufficient spatial resolution, and optical satellites cannot directly measure it. To address it, we constructed a framework for estimating lake salinity by combining Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. It can be summarized in step 1: construct a salinity mechanism model based on SAR data using the Elfouhaily spectrum, dielectric constant, and small perturbation method (SPM) models; step 2: develop four machine learning (ML) salinity algorithms using quasi-synchronous salinity and MSI with SAR imagery; and step 3: build an ensemble model to estimate salinity by coupling the mechanism and ML models via a generalized additive model. The proposed integrated algorithm (N= 84, RMSE = 0.60 ppt, and MAPE = 2.3 %) outperformed single-satellite microwave mechanistic or ML models across all eleven lakes in the Inner Mongolia Xinjiang Lake zone. On this basis, we reconstructed the lake salinity dataset for 2016–2024 and conducted independent validation (N= 65, R2= 0.97, and RMSE = 0.89 ppt) and pixel-level histogram validation confirmed dataset quality, with no significant systematic bias across lake types. The reconstruction revealed a spatial pattern of smooth transition from the nearshore to the center and trends with significant increases in Lake Daihai and Lake Dalinor. The dataset and its development framework will facilitate exploration of salinity status and trends in inland lakes, providing scientific evidence and methodological support for salinization prevention and global lake salinity budget research. The dataset (10 m spatial resolution, TIF format) is publicly available via Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18371515, Deng et al., 2026) and includes annual/seasonal salinity rasters and statistical files."

Using satellite images from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions, we identified over 5,000 platforms in six major offshore basins between 2017 and 2023 and recorded their locations and statuses. This open dataset extends existing records and supports environmental monitoring, offshore infrastructure management, and planning of mitigation strategies. 
 Accurate information on the location and operational status of offshore oil and gas platforms (OOGPs) is important to inform decision-making by various stakeholders and to evaluate the environmental impacts of OOGPs. However, existing OOGP databases are often incomplete or outdated data. In this work, we use satellite data and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to construct a new database of OOGPs for six major offshore oil and gas basins in the world between 2017 and 2023. We use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission to detect OOGP candidates due to its high sensitivity to OOGPs, dense spatio-temporal sampling, and global coverage. Our main processing steps comprise the detection of OOGP candidates using monthly averages of SAR images and the removal of noise and false positive objects from annual image composites. With the resulting dataset of OOGPs, we map the spatiotemporal distribution of OOGPs in the study regions and analyze platform status after the post-processing of the platform targets. Using these methods, we identified a total of 5,358 OOGPs distributed in six offshore basins: the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) (1,593), Persian Gulf (PG) (1,437), North Sea (440), Caspian Sea (CS) (794), Gulf of Guinea (460), and Gulf of Thailand (634). An independent validation dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the detection algorithm, which achieved an extraction accuracy of 98 %. This OOGPs dataset substantially enhances and complements the existing offshore platform database in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. From our analysis of this OOGP dataset, we observed that offshore platform activity has declined in regions like the GoM due to infrastructure aging and policy shifts, while it has expanded in the PG and CS, reflecting ongoing offshore development. These different regional trends highlight the need for targeted environmental oversight and region-specific mitigation strategies."

We release an open global dataset of temperature-driven vertical thermoelastic displacement for ~15,000 stations (2000–2023), computed from hourly temperature fields and site-specific soil and rock properties. The dataset helps improve the consistency of GNSS height time series for long-term land-motion studies. 
 The nonlinear signals in global GNSS station height time series reflects both non-tidal mass loading (atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological) and temperature-driven thermoelastic deformation (TED). However, a globally consistent and reproducible TED data product has long been lacking. Here we present a global dataset of vertical TED for ~15,000 GNSS stations spanning 2000–2023, generated using a full-spectrum, layered finite-element model. The model is driven by hourly ERA5 soil-temperature profiles and parameterized with depth-dependent thermophysical properties from the SoilGrids dataset, enabling consistent quantification of TED from semi-diurnal/diurnal variability through seasonal to interannual timescales. Compared with an identical homogeneous-medium benchmark, subsurface stratification typically changes annual amplitudes by ~0.3 mm and shifts the timing of the annual maximum by ~1 month, yielding regionally coherent and smoothly varying spatial patterns. At stations with independent site characterization, the site-constrained solutions agree closely with SoilGrids-based solutions, with annual-amplitude differences of 0.01–0.03 mm and annual-phase differences mostly within 1–3°. Sensitivity tests using ±10% perturbations in thermal expansion, thermal diffusivity, and Young’s modulus indicate that annual-cycle amplitude and phase are robust. Globally, annual TED amplitudes are typically 1–2 mm, exceed 2–3 mm at some stations, and reach peak-to-peak values up to ~5 mm, with the largest signals concentrated in arid inland and continental climate regions. When TED corrections are applied together with non-tidal mass-loading corrections, the residual vertical dispersion decreases at most stations, with vertical scatter reduced by up to ~70 % at selected sites. The dataset is publicly available for direct use in GNSS coordinate time series correction and related geophysical applications: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18256342 (Lu et al., 2026)."

Madakumbura,The Western United States Large Forest-Fire Stochastic  Simulator (WULFFSS) 1.0: a monthly gridded  forest-fire model using interpretable statistics,"The new Western United States Large Forest Fire Stochastic Simulator (WULFFSS) is a monthly gridded model to simulate forest fires across the western United States in response to vegetation, topographic, anthropogenic, and climate factors. The model is highly skillful, accounting for over 80 % of the observed variability in annual forest-fire area and capturing observed spatial, intra-annual variations, and trends. 
 We developed the WULFFSS, a stochastic monthly gridded forest-fire model for the western United States (US). Operating at 12 km resolution, WULFFSS calculates monthly probabilities of fires that burn at least 100 ha of forest area as well as the forest area burned per fire. The model is forced by variables related to vegetation, topographic, anthropogenic, and climate factors, organized into three indices representing spatial, annual-cycle, and lower frequency temporal domains. These indices can interact, so variables promoting fire in one domain amplify fire-promoting effects in another. Fire probability and size models use multiple logistic and linear regression, respectively, and can be easily updated as new data or ideas emerge. During its training period of 1985–2024, WULFFSS captures 71 % and 86 % of observed interannual variability in western US forest-fire frequency and area, respectively. It reproduces regional differences in seasonal timing, frequencies, and sizes of fires, and performs well in cross-validation exercises that test the model's accuracy in years or regions not considered during model training. While lacking fine-scale fire dynamics, use of classic statistics promotes interpretability and efficient ensemble generation. Designed to run within a vegetation ecosystem model, bidirectional feedbacks between vegetation and fire can identify how ecosystem changes have altered or will alter fire-climate relationships across the western US. The model's predictive power should improve with increasingly accurate and extensive observational data, and its approach can be extended to other regions. Here we provide a thorough description of the WULFFSS model, including the motivation underlying its development, caveats to our approach, and areas for future improvement."

However, existing global data largely focus on secondary effluents, providing little actionable evidence for reuse-oriented systems. Here, we present the first integrated framework combining targeted antibiotic residue analysis with shotgun metagenomics of the resistome, mobilome, and microbiome across full-scale reuse-oriented wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Southern Europe to identify sentinel antibiotic resistance families for monitoring. Reclaimed effluents exhibited lower AMR exposure levels than those typically reported for secondary effluents (<0.5 ARGs/cell), while mobile genetic element (MGE) abundances were comparable to secondary effluents (1–2 MGEs/cell). Effluent communities differed by WWTP configuration: membrane bioreactor combined with ultrafiltration favored nutrient-removal/oxidative-stress taxa and reduced transferable MGEs, whereas plants relying on physical separation (sand filtration or reverse osmosis) retained fecal-associated taxa and MGEs. Specific clinically relevant ARGs persisted after treatments, including aadA and aph(3′’)-Ibs (resistance to aminoglycosides), ermB and mphA (resistance to macrolides), and blaOXA-129 (resistance to beta-lactams), which we identify as sentinel markers for monitoring reclaimed water and sludge. We advance a generalizable two-step framework, metagenomic discovery to identify sentinel markers, followed by targeted assays for streamlined surveillance, that provides the first operational blueprint for integrating AMR into water reuse management under the EU regulation."

This study presents a wet ball milling-surface engineering strategy for synthesizing low-molecular-weight organic acid (LMWOA)-modified ZVI, which enables a novel dual redox activation mechanism for Fe(II)─a functionality that cannot be achieved by conventional wet ball milling or external LMWOA addition. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that α-hydroxy carboxylic acids (e.g., citric, tartaric, and malic acids) form five-membered chelate rings via hydrogen bonding, thereby significantly enhancing electron transfer kinetics from Fe(0) to Fe(II). Meanwhile, non-α-hydroxy carboxylic acids (e.g., succinic/acetic/formic acids) promote Fe(III) adsorption–reduction cycles, thus sustaining Fe(II) regeneration. Notably, ZVI modified with oxalic acid or ascorbic acid exhibited a synergistic effect of both pathways, resulting in the highest Cr(VI) removal capacities, with 19.7- and 22.6-fold increases in Cr(VI) removal and Fe(III) recovery rates of 81.7% and 108.9% relative to unmodified ZVI, respectively. This enhanced performance can be attributed to the improved dissolution of Fe(II) and the elevated levels of structurally bound Fe(II), which collectively promote sustained electron generation and effective transfer to Cr(VI). These findings indicate that LMWOA-modified ZVI establishes a tunable Fe(II) activation system, thereby positioning LMWOA as a promising strategic platform for groundwater remediation."

To address critical knowledge gaps regarding the temporal dynamics of FPW composition and toxicity, we conducted one-year intermittent sampling at an active shale gas site. By integrating whole-effluent toxicity testing with zebrafish embryos, toxicity identification evaluation, and compositional analysis, we identified temporal-specific toxicity transitions driven by temporal chemical variation. During flowback, embryo toxicity (96h-LC50: 3–45% dilution) showed a nonmonotonic decline, characterized by distinct toxicological stages: organic pollutants dominated the early-stage toxicity (>70% contribution), while joint effects of metals and oxidants governed midflowback toxicity. Principal component analysis resolved divergent chemical trajectories, demonstrating progressive organic contaminant decline alongside cumulative inorganic accumulation. Leveraging these insights, we developed a rapid risk classification system using an optimized LightGBM model with SHAP interpretability. This framework employs three routine monitoring parameters (TDS, TOC, pH) to stratify FPW risk levels with 81.3% accuracy, enabling field-deployable risk management strategies. By elucidating mechanistic shifts in FPW toxicity during continuous flowback, our work established stage-specific treatment priorities while bridging dynamic toxicity mechanisms with practical monitoring parameters to advance sustainable practices for shale gas operations."

This study elucidates the impact of alternating aerobic–anoxic conditions on metabolism of the two phylogenetically distinct groups of methanotrophs: Methylomonas koyamae (type I, γ-proteobacteria) and Methylocystis bryophila (type II, α-proteobacteria). Using batch cultivations with single and repeated oxygen pulses, we demonstrated that cyclic aerobic–anoxic alternation significantly increased the secretion of organic compounds. Notably, acetate secretion by the type II methanotroph M. bryophila was observed for the first time. Genome-scale metabolic modeling and flux balance analysis revealed that acetate secretion serves as an auxiliary ATP-generating pathway for M. bryophila under oxygen limitation. We further uncovered a dynamic mechanism: aerobic phases trigger methane uptake and build up intracellular organic carbon pools, while anoxic phases redirect these pools toward acetate and/or hydrogen release to sustain survival under oxygen limitation. This cyclic regimen effectively channels more methane-derived carbon into extracellular acetate. Our findings underscore that redox conditions critically shape methanotrophic metabolism, influencing both the biological methane cycle and the global climate."

However, the aridity threshold at which the transition occurs and how the controls over different soil C fractions shift remain unclear. Here, we conducted a 2400 km transect survey across 45 sites spanning a broad aridity gradient in temperate grasslands of China. We identified a pronounced shift in the dominant drivers of soil C storage at an aridity threshold of 0.749. Below this threshold, complex vegetation structures enhanced soil C by promoting microbial activity and mineral abundance, which stimulated the accumulation of both POM and MAOM, with a stronger effect on POM. Above the threshold, fine roots dominated soil biochemical processes, sustaining microbial activity and mineral formation that indirectly stabilized SOC, particularly via MAOM. Across the entire aridity gradient, vegetation structure mediated surface soil susceptibility to wind erosion with complex structures providing effective protection, while simpler structures offered limited buffering. These findings highlight the dual role of vegetation-mediated C input and wind erosion protection in sustaining soil stocks in drylands, underscoring the need to account for canopy and root structure when species are selected for dryland restoration."

Here, we combine field investigations in the Taipu River with laboratory experiments to elucidate the distribution and biogeochemical transformation of Sb at the SWI. Pore waters exhibit Sb concentrations substantially higher than those in overlying waters, while sediment cores show maximum Sb accumulation at depths of 5–10 cm and lower concentrations in surface sediments. Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGTs) reveal decreasing labile Sb with depth, indicating upward diffusion of reduced Sb from anoxic zones; however, flux calculations demonstrate a dominant net downward transport driven by oxidative scavenging in oxic sediments. Laboratory simulations show complete oxidation of dissolved Sb(III) to Sb(V) within 42 days. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms that Fe/Mn (oxyhydr)oxides mediate this oxidation and immobilize Sb(V) through strong surface binding. Sediment incubations further reveal a transient increase in Sb bioavailability during Fe/Mn oxide dissolution, followed by long-term stabilization in residual phases. These results highlight the dual role of Fe/Mn minerals in regulating Sb redox cycling and sequestration, providing mechanistic insights into Sb mobility, ecological risk, and remediation strategies in riverine environments."

Plata,Rapid Identification and Quantification of the Octanol–Water Partitioning Coefficients of Polymer Degradation Products,"The extensive global use of synthetic polymers has raised concern about their environmental fate, particularly regarding the generation and ecological impact of polymer degradation products. Effective environmental risk assessment requires an understanding of degradation product identity and environmental behavior, yet polymer metabolomics libraries are not well-populated. In this work, mass remainder analysis was used to systematically characterize oligomeric degradation products of polyamide-6 (PA6), polycaprolactone (PCL), and polylactic acid (PLA) using nontarget liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. Distinct homologous series were identified, revealing oligomers of up to seven repeating units for PA6, four for PCL, and 12 for PLA. Among the features detected, up to 70% formed remainder-based clusters (i.e., related by Kendrick mass defects of whole integers and a constant remainder) indicative of plastic-derived oligomerization patterns. To overcome limitations in molecular formula annotations for larger oligomers generated by SIRIUS, this work leveraged retention time variations, MS2 fragmentation, and spectral matching for reliable characterization and structural elucidation. Retention time changes across varying mobile-phase pHs (2.7, 5.0, and 9.0) revealed substantial shifts for oligomers with ionizable functional groups, allowing quantitative insights into their acid–base properties (pKa). These experimentally determined hydrophobicity values (i.e., log Kow) deviated from computational estimations from a suite of available tools across polymer chemistries, highlighting inadequacies in existing estimation models and the opportunity for the rapid measurement of these important physicochemical properties using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry workflows. This work demonstrates the necessity of experimentally derived oligomer-specific data to improve computational modeling for assessing the environmental fate of polymer degradation products."

While studies have examined either chemical composition or toxicity, comprehensive investigations combining both remain limited. Here, we conducted an in-depth physicochemical characterization of airborne, size-separated BWP from two brake pad types and comprehensively assessed their in vitro toxicity using human lung epithelial cells (A549). Iron, primarily in the form of iron oxide, was the most abundant element in the wear particles (33–50% by mass), with evidence pointing to the brake disc as the main source. A surprisingly high resemblance in elemental composition at the nano- and microscale was observed. This, along with an absence of clear differences in metal profiles or toxicological responses between size fractions, suggests that brake wear microparticles may form through compaction of vapor-condensed nanoparticles on the friction surfaces, followed by their release through mechanical shearing. Acellular and cellular assays showed the concentration-dependent ability of all studied particles to induce reactive oxygen species production, antioxidant depletion, and oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage. The nonasbestos organic pad, with more than 50-fold higher copper levels than the low-metallic pad, induced stronger DNA damage and acellular antioxidant depletion, suggesting copper as a potential source for the enhanced toxicity."

Hornbuckle,Widespread Emissions of Polychlorinated Biphenyls from Building Materials in Vermont Schools,"In collaboration with Vermont state and school officials, we conducted a research study to measure emissions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from room surfaces in Vermont schools. Our study, the largest of its kind, investigated the sources of airborne PCBs in indoor school environments. Using simultaneous deployment of air samplers and emission samplers, we measured airborne PCBs in 16 schools and 98 school rooms constructed prior to 1980. There was a wide range in PCB air concentrations (1.7–5700 ng m–3, n = 159) and surface emissions (33–830,000 ng m–2 d–1, n = 182) across different schools as well as between rooms in the same school. We found that emissions of PCB congeners from walls, floors, ceiling and wall expansion joint caulking, and spray insulation explain the airborne PCB congener concentrations in many rooms. Our emission samplers identified three distinct types of building materials with emissions exceeding 30,000 ng m–2 d–1 including expansion joint sealant (up to 480,000 ng m–2 d–1), glass block windows (up to 30,000 ng m–2 d–1), and fireproof coating on steel columns (up to 830,000 ng m–2 d–1). Consequently, school staff have an estimated excess lifetime cancer risk from both dioxin-like and nondioxin-like PCBs that ranges from 1.3 × 10–8 to 1.7 × 10–4 for central tendency exposure, and 2.8 × 10–8 to 3.8 × 10–4 for reasonable maximum exposure (State of Vermont’s target cancer risk = 1 × 10–6). Although production has been banned for decades, our study illustrates that PCBs continue to pose an exposure risk to occupants due to their long history of use in building materials. Our findings underscore the risks associated with the historic presence of PCB-containing building materials, offering critical insights for community efforts aimed at reducing exposure among children and school staff in thousands of schools across the country."

This study investigated temporal variations of 26 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in four alpine lake sediment cores across the TP spanning 1952–2020. Total PFAS concentrations ranged from 43.7 to 1428 pg g–1 of dw. Linear regression of log-transformed PFAS concentration revealed a significant elevation-dependent trend across the studied lakes (R2 = 0.58, p < 0.01) after excluding the lower-altitude, more human-impacted Qinghai Lake (3190 m), supporting mountain cold-trapping of these pollutants in high-altitude environments. Ranwu Lake demonstrated a unique PFAS profile dominated by perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), which contributed 48% of total PFASs on average, reflecting the predominant influence of glacier meltwater input pathways. The deposition flux exhibited an overall increasing trend, with fluctuations between 7.62 and 258 pg cm–2 a–1 during the studied period. Following a phase of relative stability or slight decline in the 1980s–1990s, all lakes showed a pronounced and sustained rise after 2000. Notably, the doubling time of short-chain PFBA (C4) flux in these lakes was estimated to be 7.4–15.6 years since the post-2000 period. Compositional analysis revealed a global shift from long-chain to short-chain PFASs in TP lake sediments, as reflected by declining PFOS (C8) and rapidly increasing levels of PFBA. The sedimentary record reveals temporal PFAS trends that closely track the historical evolution of global and regional PFAS emissions. Our findings provide crucial insights into the long-term trends of PFAS pollution in high-altitude ecosystems, contributing to global PFAS management efforts by assessing the effectiveness of regulations and the environmental impacts of industrial relocations."

And neurotoxicity of the fungicide DMM through integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and metabolomic profiling in pregnant mice brain tissue. Our results demonstrate that DMM exposure induces significant alterations in both the proportions and functions of multiple neural cell populations, including microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, accompanied by metabolic reprogramming and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Single-cell analysis revealed cell subtype-specific transcriptional changes and aberrant activation of metabolic pathways (e.g., PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling), while metabolomic profiling further identified substantial disturbances in amino acid, lipid, and energy metabolism. Furthermore, cell–cell communication analysis indicated enhanced pathological signaling network interactions under DMM exposure. These findings not only elucidate the mechanisms underlying DMM-induced neurotoxicity but also highlight the potential risks of pesticide exposure during pregnancy to maternal and fetal health, providing critical insights for pesticide safety assessment and the development of neuroprotective strategies."

Recent studies have demonstrated that sunscreen chemicals can undergo sea-to-air transport via sea spray aerosols (SSA). However, their transformation behavior and environmental fate in the aerosol phase remain poorly understood. This study reports the heterogeneous oxidation kinetics and mechanisms of three typical sunscreen chemicals (4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), benzophenone-4 (BP-4), and propylparaben (PrPB)) initiated by hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the aerosol phase composed of sea salt and organic matter. The measured heterogeneous rate constants for reactions with OH ranged from 2.07 × 10–12 to 4.52 × 10–12 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, corresponding to an average atmospheric lifetime of approximately 41–89 h, indicating their potential for long-distance transport before degradation. Through the characterization of the components of aged aerosols, it was found that the functionalization reactions play a key role in the oxidation process, and the unexpected decrease in the O/C ratio of BP-4 products was attributed to sulfonic group loss. In addition, the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay indicated that the aged aerosols exhibit an overall low oxidative potential. These findings enhance our understanding of the environmental behavior and potential atmospheric impact of sunscreen chemicals in SSA."

Herein, an analysis of data from US Air Force bases was conducted to demonstrate that high levels of soil and groundwater PFAS contamination at such sites are common, particularly in testing and training areas, suggesting that prevention of PFAS leaching from such soils is a critical priority. Nonsaturated soil column experiments were conducted to optimize the use of soil-applied biochars as a low-cost strategy for adsorbing C8 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and C4 perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) and preventing their downward leaching. A wood-based biochar produced at >900 °C and added to the soil at 1% (m/m) was found to exhibit physio-chemical properties that facilitated excellent (>99%) retention of PFOS in a sandy loam soil. Moreover, postproduction thermal treatment (400 °C in air) of the biochar led to excellent retention of short-chain PFBS, essentially yielding nondetectable PFBS levels in the column leachate. The application of carefully selected biochars to areas with high levels of PFAS contamination at military facilities is likely a useful and low-cost approach for protecting groundwater from PFOS and PFBS (and perhaps other PFAS) contamination."

Effective defluorination methods are crucial, especially in clarifying reactive species’ roles in carbon-skeleton disruption versus C–F bond cleavage. We present a novel UV/Fe(NO3)3 system that integrates ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and singlet oxygen (1O2) to achieve 90% GenX degradation in 1 h and 99% defluorination in 6 h. Mechanistic studies under controlled atmospheres reveal a hierarchical pathway: Fe3+-triggered LMCT initiates C–C bond disruption, decarboxylation, and ether-oxygen bond cleavage, while nitrate-photolysis-derived RNS accelerates this process via electron transfer (ET). Fe2+-mediated conversion of O2 to 1O2 drives C–F bond scission, revealing an oxygen-dependent cascade defluorination involving Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycling and RNS. Oxygen availability raises defluorination from 8 to 99%. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the Fe2+ activation of triplet O2 to 1O2 lowers the defluorination barrier by 118.8 kcal/mol. This approach works across diverse water matrices, achieving >88% defluorination of eight per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) within 12 h and remains robust in treating fluorochemical effluents.

In a recent proof-of-principle in vitro study, we showed that personalized mixtures (PMs), reconstructed from 24 persistent organic pollutant (POPs) concentrations measured in individual blood samples from Swedish adults, induced unique interindividual effects on H295R cell viability and steroidogenesis. Here, we followed up by testing submixtures of four PMs (PM#3, PM#4, PC1-OC-Mix, and PC2-PFAS-Mix), separated by the chemical classes perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Submixtures of PFAS and OCPs induced significant effects on testosterone synthesis at low (1×) and medium (10×) concentrations, consistent with effects observed in the corresponding whole PMs, and were therefore likely the primary drivers of the whole-mixture effects on testosterone. Notably, some submixtures altered estradiol and testosterone levels in ways not observed in full PMs, suggesting antagonistic interactions across chemical classes when combined. Potential antagonistic interaction in more complex mixtures, independent of concentration, was also observed within OCP submixtures, as only the less complex OCP mixtures lacking DDE or DDT induced testosterone synthesis. For additional mechanistic insight, we expanded the H295R assay to include oxidative stress analyses, which revealed no effects from the PMs. RT-qPCR analysis showed downregulation of CYP11A1 after exposure to PM#3 and PM#4 at high concentrations (100×), suggesting a feedback mechanism contributing to suppressed testosterone synthesis."

Previous estimates have relied on the emission factor (EF) approach, which carries substantial uncertainties due to its inherent limitations. Here, we developed a mass-balance model to re-estimate global Hg emissions from OBB during 2010–2019, enabling quantification of emissions from individual vegetation tissues. Our results indicate that global annual Hg emissions average 280 Mg yr–1 (ranging 93–803 Mg yr–1), including 129 Mg yr–1 from vegetation-derived combustion, 81 Mg yr–1 from litterfall combustion, and 70 Mg yr–1 from peatland fires. Emissions exhibit strong latitudinal and longitudinal variability, with hotspots in central Africa, the Indo-China Peninsula, and boreal Asia. By category, the largest contributors are Africa (49%) among continents, savannas (29%) among biomes, and leaves (58%) among vegetation-derived emissions. Seasonal peaks occur in January, March, and August, while total annual emissions remain relatively stable over the decade, despite extreme anomalies such as the 2015 Indonesian fires.

This work describes the occurrence of micropollutants in Goreangab Reservoir water and assesses the removal of a target steroid hormone micropollutant, 17β-estradiol (E2), with various emerging membrane processes. Results show that a variety of micropollutants exist in water, and many of them exceed the European guideline concentration values for surface water. While nanofiltration provides only moderate E2 removal (50 ± 9% for loose and 81 ± 4% for dense NF) from an initial concentration of 100 ng L–1, reactive photocatalytic membranes and a combination of ultrafiltration (UF) and adsorption by polymer-based spherical activated carbon (PBSAC) can remove 85–98% of E2, bringing the water quality closer to the target guideline (0.4 ng L–1). Water components such as organic matter, ions, and other micropollutants interfered with E2 removal to varying degrees, highlighting the requirement for pretreatment and process validation with real water. UF-PBSAC achieves good E2 removal at a comparatively low pressure, resulting in low energy consumption. The amount of energy required to apply light irradiation and voltage in photo- and electrocatalytic membrane systems is significant based on theoretical estimation."

Electroactive biosensors (e-biosensors) hold significant potential in detecting toxic pollutants through bioelectrical signal responses but are constrained by inefficient electron and mass transport within conventional biofilm-based architectures. Here, we address both limitations by developing a 3D-engineered e-biosensor with a synergistically optimized material composition and geometric architecture. A novel electroactive living material was fabricated by incorporating Ca2+-doped PEDOT:PSS to enhance microbial extracellular electron transport. The living material was then engineered into a grid-structure e-biosensor by extrusion-based 3D bioprinting, significantly improving analyte mass transport to the sensing cells. This dual optimization resulted in the 3D-engineered e-biosensor exhibiting a 6.3-fold increase in baseline current, a 1.9-fold improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, and an extended operational stability (>140 h) relative to conventional biofilm-based counterparts. Moreover, the 3D-engineered e-biosensors demonstrated a rapid response (<20 min) to various toxic pollutants, including Cr(VI) and nitrobenzene.

Due to their growing global demand and limited primary sources, there is an urgent need to explore alternative sources for REEs recovery. Oil sand tailings, a major byproduct of bitumen extraction processes, represent an underexplored source of REEs and other valuable metals. In this study, we investigated the mineralogical and biogeochemical characteristics of three distinct oil sands tailing streams to assess their potential as a secondary source of REEs and to better understand their speciation and distribution mechanisms. Chemical analyses of these tailings indicated elevated concentrations of several metals, such as aluminum (≈94,490 mg/kg), titanium (≈10,210 mg/kg), magnesium (≈5891 mg/kg), and manganese (≈1060 mg/kg). REEs concentrations ranged from 442.72 to 797.79 mg/kg, highlighting the tailings’ potential for resource recovery. The extraction of REEs from such waste streams aligns with the “waste-to-resource” concept, offering an environmentally sustainable route to strategic material supply diversification. This study provides critical insights into the complex interplay among mineralogy, geochemistry, and microbiology of REEs and other valuable elements in oil sands tailings.

Many new mechanistic insights have been reported recently, diversifying potential α-pinene ozonolysis SOA formation pathways. However, our ability to integrate these mechanisms and kinetically simulate α-pinene ozonolysis SOA formation has not been fully evaluated. In this work, we updated the detailed α-pinene ozonolysis mechanism in the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) with processes including peroxy radical (RO2) unimolecular autoxidation and bimolecular reactions with HO2 and RO2, the fates of alkoxy radicals (RO), gas-particle partitioning, and condensed-phase dimer ester formation. A kinetic model was built to evaluate the new mechanism along with existing mechanisms in simulations of SOA mass concentrations and chemical composition. Uncertainties of key parameters such as reaction rate constants, product yields and volatilities, and gas-particle partitioning coefficients are tested to demonstrate the gaps in current understandings of the α-pinene ozonolysis mechanism. Our results suggest that uncertainties in MCM reactions, RO2 autoxidation, RO2 + RO2 dimerization kinetics, as well as the gas-particle partitioning parameters, all significantly impact α-pinene ozonolysis SOA simulations. Although the SOA mass concentrations can be well predicted by tuning the parameters within reasonable ranges, all models overestimate the SOA oxygen-to-carbon ratios and peroxide fractions, indicating unrecognized pathways. By comprehensively analyzing these uncertainties and gaps, this work provides new insights for future α-pinene ozonolysis mechanistic studies."

Here, we explore the capacity of α-cyclodextrin to absorb molecules representing odorants. The semivolatile sugar erythritol (C4H10O4) is soluble in α-cyclodextrin. It evaporates from pure seed particles in an aerosol suspension in roughly 3 h at room temperature and more slowly when mixed with α-cyclodextrin, consistent with an ideal solution (Raoult’s law). However, when erythritol evaporates from particles in the presence of other particles containing α-cyclodextrin at low relative humidity, the erythritol does not appear to be taken up into the α-cyclodextrin (unlike other sugars such as glucose, sucrose, and raffinose). This suggests that the dry α-cyclodextrin is sufficiently glassy to resist the uptake of the semivolatile polyol. In contrast, α-cyclodextrin will sorb the much more volatile sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene, showing evidence for a substantially low (favorable) activity coefficient toward this species, illustrating the capacity of α-cyclodextrin to capture and retain highly volatile compounds."

However, a clear and quantifiable signature of tectonic uplift on decadal to centennial shoreline retreat rates is outstanding. We isolate the contribution of tectonic uplift to setting shoreline retreat and shore platform morphology from other marine and geologic drivers across the West Coast of the USA. Specifically, we find that decadal‐scale tectonic uplift, derived from tide gauge records, exerts a significant and measurable control on shoreline retreat rates. Additional influences from wave action, shore platform morphology, and tidal range further contribute to the regional patterns in coastal erosion, and together these factors enable accurate prediction of retreat rates using a multivariate model. Our analysis also reveals robust, time‐scale dependent relationships between uplift rate, shore platform morphology, and shoreline retreat. On decadal time scales, rapid tectonic uplift acts as a buffer, shielding the shore from wave action, slowing retreat, and corresponding with narrow shore platforms. On millennial time scales, higher uplift rates relate to wider shore platforms, reflecting greater cumulative shoreline retreat. These observations likely reflect the effects of episodic, seismically driven subsidence, which shifts wave action landward, enhancing wave‐driven erosion. Through repeated cycles of uplift and subsidence, the seismic cycle amplifies both shore platform development and long‐term retreat. Together, these findings highlight the critical role of tectonics in shaping shoreline retreat and driving landscape evolution timescales on active margins."

Specifically, the loss mechanisms (export, melt, deformation) and gain mechanism (replenishment) associated with MYI area variations are examined. On average, there was an annual (October‐September) MYI area loss of 1,080.3 × 103 km2 due to export, melt, and deformation of 749.2 × 103 km2, 222.5 × 103 km2, and 108.6 × 103 km2, respectively. The substantial MYI depletion was largely offset by replenishment from the aging of first‐year ice (FYI) at the end of the melt season, which on average amounted to 993.8 × 103 km2 in the Arctic Ocean. Therefore, a net annual MYI area loss of −86.5 × 103 km2 emerged in the Arctic. The consecutive occurrence of the anomalously low MYI replenishment from 2005 to 2007 was responsible for the dramatic decadal decline of MYI area between the QuikSCAT (P1:2000‐2008) and ASCAT (P2: 2009–2018) periods from 3.29 × 106 km2 during P1 dropping a half to 1.61 × 106 km2 during P2. Moreover, the recently enhanced melt and deformation processes were favorable in maintaining the Arctic MYI at the low‐level coverage during P2 relative to P1. The thermodynamic (melt and replenishment) and dynamic mechanisms (export) related to MYI variations are linked to Dipole Anomaly (DA), whereas North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) acts to influence the thermodynamic mechanism (melt and replenishment). On the other hand, no significant connection is identified for Arctic Oscillation (AO) or Barents‐Beaufort Oscillation (BBO)."

The FMJO typically occurs in November, whereas the FBSISO mainly occurs in early May. The FMJO onset exhibits substantially larger interannual variability. The timing of both phenomena is strongly influenced by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which modulates large scale atmospheric conditions, particularly through column moisture anomalies. The leading Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) mode of April column moisture anomalies displays a meridional dipolar pattern over the Indian Ocean. Its associated principal component (PC) time series shows a statistically significant correlation with the FBSISO onset date, indicating that a strong meridional moisture contrast with positive anomalies over the northern Indian Ocean favors an earlier FBSISO onset. The leading EOF mode of November column moisture anomalies exhibits a zonal dipolar pattern extending from the western equatorial Indian Ocean to the Maritime Continent, with a pronounced meridional contrast over the Maritime Continent. The corresponding PC is significantly correlated with the FMJO onset date, suggesting that a zonal moisture contrast with higher moisture over the western Pacific favors an earlier FMJO onset. These moisture anomalies are closely linked to ENSO conditions. Consequently, ENSO also modulates the onset timing of these events, although the onset dates show weaker correlations with ENSO than with monthly moisture anomalies. The physical mechanisms underlying the distinct responses of the FMJO and FBSISO to ENSO remain to be elucidated."

Wolff,Structural Accommodation as a Coastal Adaptation Response to Sea‐Level Rise: Lessons From Europe,"Global sea‐level rise is intensifying pressures on coastal regions, increasing the need for adaptation strategies (e.g., protect, retreat, accommodate). At the same time, decision makers require a better understanding of the available responses to address the widening adaptation implementation gap. Structural measures aimed at reducing the impacts of coastal hazards as part of the accommodation strategy have received limited attention in the coastal adaptation literature with few studies looking at how it is currently considered to address sea‐level rise. We first advance a conceptual framework that separates structural from non‐structural accommodation, recognizing that this distinction is essential to accurately define the adaptation “solution space.” Building on this framework, we synthesize scientific and gray literature, conduct a multilevel review of policy and technical documents, and draw on expert input to not only evaluate the current state of structural accommodation in Europe but also to highlight generic lessons for its potential implementation. This includes consideration of its advantages and disadvantages. Uptake remains fragmented and highly localized, embedded mainly in municipal spatial planning rather than national adaptation agendas, and is hampered by financial, institutional, and technical constraints. We argue that stronger policy integration and dedicated financial incentives could overcome these barriers and harness accommodation's value as a flexible option capable of reducing risk and avoiding long‐term lock‐in. This study improves our understanding of how this strategy can contribute to coastal resilience in Europe and beyond."

 Deep mantle melting marks the onset of Earth differentiation1, yet a unifying framework for how buoyancy-driven mantle upwellings initiate melting and how such incipient melts evolve within the asthenosphere has remained elusive. Here we show that the first melts generated in any solid-state mantle upwelling are kimberlitic CO2-rich silicate melts that form at about 250 km depth through oxidation of elemental carbon to CO2 (refs. 2,3). Our experiments force a range of surface melts, derived from mantle plumes4 or broad upwellings5 (kimberlites, ocean island basalts and mid-ocean ridge basalts), into equilibrium with fertile mantle at adiabatic and super-adiabatic conditions at 7 GPa. The results define a framework in which redox melting at depth universally yields kimberlitic melts, which, while ascending through the asthenosphere by reactive porous flow6,7, evolve to higher degrees of melting, lesser volatiles and incompatible elements, but higher SiO2. Channelized flow7 in the lithosphere may then enable direct extraction of these melts, leading to kimberlites, where the lithosphere commences just above the C → CO2 redox front, to alkaline Si-undersaturated intraplate magmas where lithospheric thicknesses are 150–100 km, and to tholeiitic basalts below mid-ocean ridges where voluminous ‘dry’ melting becomes overwhelming. This framework is consistent with the widespread seismic low-velocity zone at about 250 km beneath mid-ocean ridges8,9 and aligns with ocean island and mid-ocean ridge basalts sampling the various geochemical mantle components at different degrees of melting in different proportions10,11.

 CD8+ T cells differentiate into diverse states that shape immune outcomes in cancer and chronic infection1–4. To define systematically the transcription factors (TFs) driving these states, we built a comprehensive atlas integrating transcriptional and epigenetic data across nine CD8+ T cell states and inferred TF activity profiles. Our analysis catalogued TF activity fingerprints, uncovering regulatory mechanisms governing selective cell state differentiation. Leveraging this platform, we focused on two transcriptionally similar but functionally opposing states that are critical in tumour and viral contexts: terminally exhausted T (TEXterm) cells, which are dysfunctional5–8, and tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells, which are protective9–13. Global TF community analysis revealed distinct biological pathways and TF-driven networks underlying protective versus dysfunctional states. Through in vivo CRISPR screening integrated with single-cell RNA sequencing (in vivo Perturb-seq) we delineated several TFs that selectively govern TEXterm cell differentiation. We also identified HIC1 and GFI1 as shared regulators of TEXterm and TRM cell differentiation and KLF6 as a unique regulator of TRM cells. We discovered new TEXterm-selective TFs, including ZSCAN20 and JDP2, with no previous known function in T cells. Targeted deletion of these TFs enhanced tumour control and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade but did not interfere with TRM cell formation. Consistently, their depletion in human T cells reduces the expression of inhibitory receptors and improves effector function. By decoupling exhaustion TEX-selective from protective TRM cell programmes, our platform enables more precise engineering of T cell states, accelerating the rational design of more effective cellular immunotherapies.

 Promoters are the core regulatory elements of all genes. Their activity ensures the correct transcription level of each individual gene, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and responses to a wide range of signals. One of the major challenges in genomics is to build computational models that accurately predict genome-wide gene expression from the sequences of regulatory elements1. Here we present promoter activity regulatory model (PARM), a cell-type-specific deep-learning model trained on specially designed massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) that query human promoter sequences. PARM is experimentally and computationally lightweight so that cell-type-specific and condition-specific models can be generated that reliably predict autonomous promoter activity across the genome from the DNA sequence alone. PARM can also design purely synthetic strong promoters. We leveraged PARM to systematically identify binding sites of transcription factors that probably contribute to the activity of each natural human promoter and to detect the rewiring of these regulatory interactions after various stimuli to the cells. We also uncovered and experimentally confirmed substantial positional preferences of transcription factors that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions and a complex grammar of motif–motif interactions. Our approach provides a highly economic strategy towards a deeper understanding of the dynamic regulation of human promoters by transcription factors. PARM is a deep-learning model trained on data from massively parallel reporter assays to help predict promoter activity in different human cell types, design synthetic promoters and identify key features of regulatory promoter grammar."

This Review provides an update on recent developments in biofluid-based biomarkers for amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, tau pathology, neurodegeneration, glial reactivity, α-synuclein pathology, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, synaptic pathophysiology and cerebrovascular disease—pathologies and processes that are all relevant to neurodegenerative dementias.

This promises to complement the clinical evaluation of suspected neurodegenerative disease in healthcare with molecular phenotyping biomarkers that will help to link the clinical symptoms to ongoing pathophysiological processes in the brain and improve how patients are referred to specialty clinics for initiation and monitoring of molecularly targeted treatments. Clinically relevant breakthroughs such as the use of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies to address Aβ pathology in AD serve as important proof-of-concept examples of how the field is advancing toward molecularly informed prevention and treatment.

 Exposure to cytosolic DNA triggers innate immune responses through cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)1,2,3. After binding to DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP as a second messenger that binds to stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a signalling adaptor protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)3–5. STING then traffics from the ER through the Golgi to perinuclear vesicle clusters, which leads to activation of the kinases TBK1 and IKK and subsequent induction of interferons and other cytokines6–9. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2; also known as PI(3,5)P2) is an endogenous ligand of STING that functions together with cGAMP to induce STING activation. Proteomic analyses identified a constitutive interaction between STING and PIKFYVE, an enzyme that produces PtdIns(3,5)P2 in mammalian cells. Deletion of PIKFYVE blocked STING trafficking from the ER and TBK1 activation. In vitro reconstitution uncovered a strong and selective effect of PtdIns(3,5)P2 on STING activation by cGAMP. PtdIns(3,5)P2 bound directly to STING in fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays. Consistently, cryo-electron microscopy revealed that PtdIns(3,5)P2 promotes cGAMP-induced STING oligomerization10, functioning as a molecular glue. Similar to PIKFYVE depletion, mutation of the PtdIns(3,5)P2-binding residues in STING largely blocked its trafficking and downstream signalling. These findings reveal that PtdIns(3,5)P2 is a lipid ligand of STING with essential roles in innate immunity.

 Anthropogenic emissions of hydrogen (H2) are expected to rise if H2 energy technology is widely implemented as part of the green energy transition1,2. Although atmospheric H2 is not radiatively active, it warms the Earth’s climate through chemical effects on methane, ozone and water vapour1–6. Predicting the atmospheric response to anthropogenic perturbations is challenging, in part because of the limited duration of the modern instrumental record7. Ice core measurements of H2 can extend the observational record, providing information about anthropogenic and natural perturbations and the biogeochemical controls on H2 levels over long timescales. However, ice core measurements of H2 are challenging because of the high permeability of H2 in ice8,9. Here we present an ice core record of atmospheric H2 recovered from a Greenland ice core, spanning the past millennium. The record shows a 70–111% (2σ) rise in atmospheric H2 from the pre-industrial to the modern era, consistent with increasing direct emissions from fossil fuel burning and increased atmospheric concentrations of H2 precursors. The pre-industrial record also shows a 4–25% (2σ) decrease in H2 levels during the Little Ice Age (LIA), indicating that H2 biogeochemistry may be sensitive to climate change. The findings suggest that the sensitivity of H2 sources and sinks to climate warming should be considered in estimates of the radiative consequences of rising anthropogenic H2 emissions.

 In pursuit of a practical quantum advantage1, analogue quantum systems provide an invaluable way to simulate the physics of quantum materials2–4, quantum systems out of equilibrium5,6 or interaction-induced localization7. Notable recent progress to realize such systems has been achieved in ultracold atoms8–12, superconducting circuits13–15 and twisted van der Waals materials16–19. However, so far, these platforms have struggled to simulate large-scale strongly interacting fermionic systems at low temperatures, at which electronic correlations dominate materials properties and numerical simulations remain restricted in accuracy and scope20,21.

By observing a metal–insulator (MI) transition on a 2D square lattice of atom-based quantum dots, we demonstrate independent and precise control of the on-site interaction U and tunnelling t. Magneto-transport measurements further indicate the formation of an insulating state driven by Mott–Hubbard/Anderson physics and promising signatures of correlated electron physics. These precision-engineered analogue quantum simulators provide a unique platform to simulate quantum materials on arbitrary 2D lattices and to explore many unanswered questions in the formation of quantum magnetism, interacting topological quantum matter and unconventional superconductivity.

 Fast and reliable validation of new designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery development remains bottlenecked by the high time and energy costs required to evaluate the lifetime of new designs1,2. Notably, existing lifetime forecasting approaches require datasets containing battery lifetime labels for target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions before prototyping, thus limiting rapid feedback3,4. Here we introduce Discovery Learning, a scientific machine learning approach that integrates active learning5, physics-guided learning6 and zero-shot learning7 into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from educational psychology. Discovery Learning can learn from historical battery designs and reduce the need for prototyping, thereby predicting the lifetime of new designs from minimal experiments. To test Discovery Learning, we present industrial-grade battery data comprising 123 large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, including diverse material–design combinations and cycling protocols. Trained on public datasets of cell designs different from ours, Discovery Learning achieves 7.2% test error in predicting cycle life using physical features from the first 50 cycles of 51% of cell prototypes. Under conservative assumptions, this results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared with conventional practices.

 Bacteria use diverse mechanisms to protect themselves against phages1–6. Many antiphage systems form large oligomeric complexes, but how oligomerization is regulated during phage infection remains mostly unknown7–12. Here we demonstrate that the bacterial immunity protein ring-activated zinc-finger RNase (RAZR) assembles into an active, 24-meric ring around the circumference of large ring structures formed by two unrelated phage proteins: a putative recombinase and a portal protein. Each multi-layered, megadalton-scale complex enables RAZR to cleave RNA nonspecifically to inhibit translation and restrict phage propagation. The recognition of unrelated phage proteins that form rings with similar diameters indicates that these proteins not only bind to RAZR but also enforce a geometry crucial to activation. The lack of large ring structures in the host probably prevents auto-immunity and RAZR activation before infection. The infection-triggered oligomerization of RAZR mirrors pathogen-induced oligomerization in eukaryotic innate immune complexes13, underscoring a common principle of immunity across biology.

 Fractionalization of the electron charge e is one of the most striking phenomena arising from strong electron–electron interactions. A celebrated example is the emergence of anyons with fractional charges in fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states1–13. Recently, zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCIs)14–19, lattice analogues of the FQHE states that form without Landau levels, have been realized20,21. FCIs provide a unique platform to investigate anyons, yet their detection remains a challenge. Here we report the observation of anyon–trions, a new type of excitonic complex formed by binding a trion with a fractional charge in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Photoluminescence spectroscopy of quantum-confined excitons reveals emergent peaks that appear only within slightly doped FCI states. The new spectral features are red-shifted relative to the trions in undoped FCIs, but share the same electric field, temperature and magnetic field dependence. These observations suggest their origin as trions binding with elementary quasi-particles, that is, anyon–trions. Crucially, the ratio of binding energies between the anyon–trions in the −2/3 and −3/5 FCI states matches the expected fractional charge ratio of e/3 to e/5. This provides strong evidence for fractional charges in FCI—an essential property of anyons. Our results address a fundamental question in FCI physics and establish trion spectroscopy as a powerful probe of fractionally charged excitations, complementary to transport- and tunnelling-based approaches.

 Bacteria have evolved a wide array of defence systems to combat phage infection, many of which rely on complex signalling systems and large protein complexes to function1. Here we describe a 164-residue prophage-encoded protein that defends bacteria by sensing conserved oligomeric components of phage assembly. This protein, called ring interacting pore 1 (Rip1), is activated by the portal or small terminase proteins of infecting phages—oligomeric ring-shaped complexes that are essential for virion maturation. Rip1 uses these phage protein ring complexes as a template to assemble into membrane-disrupting pores that inhibit phage virion assembly and cause premature death of the host cell. Rip1 homologues are widely distributed across bacteria and provide robust defence against diverse phages. This study reveals a strategy by which a small defence protein integrates both sensing and effector activity by exploiting a conserved feature of viral assembly. The mechanism mirrors eukaryotic pore-forming immunity but is executed by a single protein, offering an evolutionarily streamlined solution to viral detection and defence. Bacteria use diverse defence systems against phages, including a 164-residue prophage-encoded protein, Rip1, which senses conserved phage assembly rings to form membrane pores that block virion maturation and trigger premature host cell death."

 The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor1–3. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, in which the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional (2D) copper–oxygen (CuO2) planes4,5, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at subgap millielectronvolt (meV) energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers6–9. However, within the CuO2 planes, the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation2,6,9,10. Here we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, 2D superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply subdiffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance—absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase—and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum-dependent and frequency-dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions.

 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an incurable neurological disorder that often begins insidiously with sleep disturbances and somatic symptoms, progressing to whole-body motor and cognitive symptoms1–5. Dysfunction of the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN)—which is thought to control action execution6,7 by coordinating arousal, organ physiology and whole-body motor plans with behavioural motivation—is a potential contributor to the diverse clinical manifestations of PD. To investigate the role of the SCAN in PD pathophysiology and treatments (medications, deep-brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and MRI-guided focused ultrasound stimulation (MRgFUS)), we built a large (n = 863), multimodal, multi-intervention clinical imaging dataset. Resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the substantia nigra and all PD DBS targets (subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral intermediate thalamus) are selectively connected to the SCAN rather than to effector-specific motor regions. Importantly, PD was characterized by specific hyperconnectivity between the SCAN and the subcortex. We therefore followed six PD cohorts undergoing DBS, TMS, MRgFUS and levodopa therapy using precision resting-state functional connectivity and electrocorticography recording. Efficacious treatments reduced SCAN-to-subcortex hyperconnectivity. Targeting the SCAN instead of effector regions doubled the efficacy of TMS treatments. Focused ultrasound treatment benefits increased when the target was closer to the thalamic SCAN sweet spot. Thus, SCAN hyperconnectivity is central to PD pathophysiology and its alleviation is a hallmark of successful neuromodulation. Targeting functionally defined subcortical SCAN nodes may improve existing therapies (DBS, MRgFUS), whereas cortical SCAN targets offer effective non-invasive or minimally invasive neuromodulation for PD. The substantia nigra and all Parkinson’s disease deep-brain stimulation targets are selectively connected to the somato-cognitive action network rather than to effector-specific motor regions."

 Copy number variants (CNVs) are key drivers of human diversity and disease risk1. Here we evaluate the role of CNVs across a broad range of human phenotypes and diseases by analysing CNVs from 470,727 UK Biobank whole-genome sequences and conducting a variant- and gene-level phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with 2,941 plasma protein abundance measurements, 13,336 binary clinical phenotypes and 1,911 quantitative traits. Proteomic analyses validated functional associations of CNVs with nearby genes (cis-protein quantitative trait loci; cis-pQTLs)—with deletions and duplications typically associated with reduced and increased protein levels, respectively—and uncovered previously unknown protein–protein interactions (trans-pQTLs). Our PheWAS recapitulated known associations and uncovered associations in both coding and non-coding regions. Notably, we identified a rare deletion in ZNF451 associated with increased leukocyte telomere length and a non-coding deletion of a SLC2A9 enhancer associated with reduced gout risk. In addition, by combining CNVs with protein-coding single nucleotide variants and indels, we enhanced the power of our study to detect gene–disease associations. Finally, we leveraged this multiomics dataset to identify several pQTLs that constitute candidate biomarkers, including TMPRSS5 for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 1A. This multiancestry whole-genome-sequence CNV PheWAS offers insights into the roles of CNVs in human health outcomes and could serve as a valuable resource for therapeutic development.

 Body–brain communication has emerged as a key regulator of tissue homeostasis1–5. Solid tumours are innervated by different branches of the peripheral nervous system and increased tumour innervation is associated with poor cancer outcomes6–8. However, it remains unclear how the brain senses and responds to tumours in peripheral organs, and how tumour–brain communication influences cancer immunity. Here we identify a tumour–brain axis that promotes oncogenesis by establishing an immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment. Combining genetically engineered mouse models with neural tracing, tissue imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we demonstrate that lung adenocarcinoma induces innervation and functional engagement of vagal sensory neurons, a major interoceptive system connecting visceral organs to the brain. Mechanistically, Npy2r-expressing vagal sensory nerves transmit signals from lung tumours to brainstem nuclei, driving elevated sympathetic efferent activity in the tumour microenvironment. This, in turn, suppresses anti-tumour immunity via β2 adrenergic signalling in alveolar macrophages. Disruption of this sensory-to-sympathetic pathway through genetic, pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches significantly inhibited lung tumour growth by enhancing immune responses against cancer. Collectively, these results reveal a bidirectional tumour–brain communication involving vagal sensory input and sympathetic output that cooperatively regulate anti-cancer immunity; targeting this tumour–brain circuit may provide new treatments for visceral organ cancers. Mouse models demonstrate that vagal sensory neurons transmit signals from lung adenocarcinoma to the brain, increasing sympathetic efferent activity in the tumour microenvironment and thereby creating a immunologically permissive environment for tumour growth."

 The first billion years of Earth history witnessed the emergence of continental magmatism, oceans and life. Yet, the details of how continents formed remain unknown because of the absence of preserved rocks1–8. Two conflicting Hadean models predominate: early onset of subduction and plate tectonics2–4, compared with early stagnant-lid and plume processes with delayed (post-Hadean) plate tectonics5–7. Here we report trace-element ratios (including Nb–Sc–U–Yb) correlated with age and hafnium and oxygen isotope ratios for Hadean detrital zircons from the Jack Hills (JH), Western Australia, which record unprecedented insights into the timing and setting of early magmatism. More than 70% of Hadean JH detrital zircons have Sc/Yb > 0.1, and 47% have U/Nb > 20, fingerprints for continental-arc and subduction settings. The remainder are ocean-island-like with little evidence for ocean-ridge settings. Hadean JH zircons probably originated from distinct terranes with separate tectonic histories. Subduction-related magmatism in the Hadean, as documented by JH zircons, alternated with periods of magmatic quiescence. This contrasts with dominantly stagnant-lid-like signatures for most Barberton Hadean zircons. The diverse settings for Jack Hills and Barberton detrital zircons imply contemporaneous operation of different tectonic styles during the Hadean, as well as a broader diversity of early crustal origins than previously known.

 The essential chaperonin T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC) (also known as chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT)) mediates protein folding in cooperation with the co-chaperone prefoldin (PFD)1–5. In vitro experiments have shown that the cylindrical TRiC complex facilitates folding through ATP-regulated client protein encapsulation6–9. However, the functional dynamics of the chaperonin system in vivo remain unexplored. Here we developed single-particle tracking in human cells to monitor the interactions of TRiC–PFD with newly synthesized proteins. Both chaperones engaged nascent polypeptides repeatedly in brief probing events typically lasting around one second, with PFD recruiting TRiC. As shown with the chaperonin client actin8, the co-translational interactions of PFD and TRiC increased in frequency and lifetime during chain elongation. Close to translation termination, PFD bound for several seconds, facilitating TRiC recruitment for post-translational folding involving multiple reaction cycles of around 2.5 s. Notably, the lifetimes of TRiC interactions with a folding-defective actin mutant were markedly prolonged, indicating that client conformational properties modulate TRiC function. Mutant actin continued cycling on TRiC until it was targeted for degradation. TRiC often remained confined near its client protein between successive binding cycles, suggesting that the chaperonin machinery operates within a localized ‘protective zone’ in which free diffusion is restricted. Together, these findings offer detailed insight into the single-molecule dynamics and supramolecular organization of the chaperonin system in the cellular environment. Single-particle tracking experiments in intact cells reveal dynamic co- and post-translational interactions of the TRiC–PFD chaperonin complex with client proteins during in vivo protein folding."

 ZFTA–RELA+ ependymomas are malignant brain tumours defined by fusions formed between the putative chromatin remodeller ZFTA and the NF-κB mediator RELA1. Here we show that ZFTA–RELA+ cells produce itaconate, a key macrophage-associated immunomodulatory metabolite2. Itaconate is generated by cis-aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1; also known as IRG1). However, the production of itaconate by tumour cells and its tumour-intrinsic role are not well established. ACOD1 is upregulated in a ZFTA–RELA-dependent manner. Functionally, itaconate enables a feed-forward system that is crucial for the maintenance of pathogenic ZFTA–RELA levels. Itaconate epigenetically activates ZFTA–RELA transcription by enriching for activating H3K4me3 via inhibition of the H3K4 demethylase KDM5. ZFTA–RELA+ tumours enhance glutamine metabolism to supply carbons for itaconate synthesis. Antagonism of ACOD1 or glutamine metabolism reduces pathogenic ZFTA–RELA levels and is potently therapeutic in multiple in vivo models. Mechanistically, ZFTA–RELA epigenetically suppresses PTEN expression to upregulate PI3K–mTOR signalling, a known driver of glutaminolysis. Finally, suppression of ACOD1 or a combination of glutamine antagonism with PI3K–mTOR inhibition abrogates spinal metastasis. Our data demonstrate that ZFTA–RELA+ ependymomas subvert a macrophage-like itaconate metabolic pathway to maintain expression of the ZFTA–RELA driver, which implicates itaconate as a candidate oncometabolite. Taken together, our results position itaconate upregulation as a previously unappreciated driver of ZFTA–RELA+ ependymomas. Our work has implications for future drug development to reduce pathogenic ZFTA–RELA expression for this brain tumour, and will advance our understanding of oncometabolites as a new class of therapeutic dependencies in cancers. The ZFTA–RELA fusion, an oncogene for ependymomas, promotes the production of itaconate, and its dependence on this metabolite represents a new therapeutic target for this cancer."

 Electrons in solids owe their properties to the periodic potential landscapes they experience. The advent of moiré lattices has revolutionized our ability to engineer such landscapes on nanometre scales, leading to numerous ground-breaking discoveries. Despite this progress, direct imaging of these electrostatic potential landscapes remains elusive. Here we introduce the atomic single electron transistor (SET), a new scanning probe that uses a single atomic defect in a van der Waals material as an ultrasensitive, high-resolution potential sensor. Built on the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) platform1, this probe leverages the capability of the QTM to form a pristine, scannable two-dimensional interface between vdW heterostructures. Using the atomic SET, we present the first direct images of the electrostatic potential in a canonical moiré interface: graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride2–10. The measured potential exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, minimal dependence on carrier density and a substantial amplitude of approximately 60 mV, even in the absence of carriers. Theory indicates that this symmetry arises from a delicate interplay of physical mechanisms with competing symmetries. The measured amplitude significantly exceeds theoretical predictions, suggesting that current understanding may be incomplete. With 1 nm spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect the potential of even a few millionths of an electron charge, the atomic SET enables ultrasensitive imaging of charge order and thermodynamic properties across a wide range of quantum phenomena, including symmetry-broken phases, quantum crystals, vortex charges and fractionalized quasiparticles.

 Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an essential adaptor in the cytosolic DNA-sensing innate immune pathway1. STING is activated by cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) produced by the DNA sensor cGAMP synthase (cGAS)2–5. cGAMP-induced high-order oligomerization and translocation of STING from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles are critical for STING activation6–11. Other studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsPs) and cholesterol also have important roles in STING activation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear12–17. Here we demonstrate that cGAMP-induced high-order oligomerization of STING is enhanced strongly by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2, and by PtdIns4P to a lesser extent. Our cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal that PtdInsPs together with cholesterol bind at the interface between STING dimers, directly promoting the high-order oligomerization. The structures also provide an explanation for the preference of the STING oligomer to different PtdInsPs. Mutational and biochemical analyses confirm the binding modes of PtdInsPs and cholesterol and their roles in STING activation. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanisms of STING mediated by specific lipids, which may underlie the role of intracellular trafficking in dictating STING signalling.

 Animals use 18–33-nucleotide PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to silence transposons in germ cells1–3. In addition to transposon-silencing piRNAs, placental mammals make pachytene piRNAs4,5, an abundant class of testis-specific small RNAs derived from long noncoding RNA precursors. Although the sites of pachytene piRNA precursor transcription are often conserved among placental mammals, the sequences of the piRNAs themselves are rapidly diverging, even in the human population6. Consequently, the biological function and mechanism of action of pachytene piRNAs remain debated. Here we report that most mouse pachytene piRNAs have no biological function but instead ‘selfishly’ promote their own production. Our data suggest that pachytene piRNAs direct endonucleolytic cleavage of partially complementary targets and neither activate nor repress mRNA translation. Although many pachytene piRNAs guide cleavage of specific mRNAs, few alter the steady-state abundance of their targets. The minority of pachytene piRNAs that reduce target mRNA abundance enhance sperm fitness, thereby ensuring production of the entire pachytene piRNA repertoire. Together, our findings explain the lack of conservation of most pachytene piRNA sequences and suggest that these ‘selfish’ small RNAs persist in mammalian evolution because target cleavage by a tiny minority of piRNAs supports male fertility. Most pachytene PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have no biological function; however, a small population enhances sperm fitness, which has led to their persistence in mammalian evolution."

 Magic-angle twisted multilayer graphene stands out as a highly tunable class of moiré materials that exhibit strong electronic correlations and robust superconductivity1–4. However, understanding the relationships between the low-temperature superconducting phase and the preceding correlated parent states remains a challenge. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy to track the formation sequence of correlated phases established by the interplay of dynamic correlations, intervalley coherence and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG). We discover the existence of two well-resolved gaps pinned at the Fermi level within the superconducting doping range. Although the outer gap, previously associated with the pseudogap phase5,6, persists at high temperatures and magnetic fields, the newly revealed inner gap is more fragile, in line with previous transport experiments1,2,4. Andreev reflection spectroscopy taken at the same location confirms a clear trend that closely follows the doping behaviour of the inner gap and not the outer one. Moreover, spectroscopy taken at nanoscale domain boundaries further corroborates the contrasting behaviour of the two gaps, with the inner gap remaining resilient to structural variations. By comparing our results with recent topological heavy fermion (THF) models that include dynamical correlations7,8, we find that the outer gap probably arises from a splitting of the Abrikosov–Suhl–Kondo resonance9,10 owing to the breaking of the valley symmetry. Our results indicate an intricate yet tractable hierarchy of correlated phases in twisted multilayer graphene. This study of magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene moiré superconductors using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy identifies two energy gaps that develop from many-body resonance in this highly tunable class of materials."

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related mortality and there are limited therapies1. Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are implicated in HCC, the involvement of the UPR transducer ATF6α remains unclear2. Here we demonstrate the function of ATF6α as an ER-stress-inducing tumour driver and metabolic master regulator restricting cancer immunosurveillance for HCC, in contrast to its well-characterized role as an adaptive response to ER stress3. ATF6α activation in human HCC is significantly correlated with an aggressive tumour phenotype, characterized by reduced patient survival, enhanced tumour progression and local immunosuppression. Hepatocyte-specific ATF6α activation in mice induced progressive hepatitis with ER stress, immunosuppression and hepatocyte proliferation. Concomitantly, activated ATF6α increased glycolysis and directly repressed the gluconeogenic enzyme FBP1 by binding to gene regulatory elements. Restoring FBP1 expression limited ATF6α-activation-related pathologies. Prolonged ATF6α activation in hepatocytes triggered hepatocarcinogenesis, intratumoural T cell infiltration and nutrient-deprived immune exhaustion. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)4 restored immunosurveillance and reduced HCC. Consistently, patients with HCC who achieved a complete response to immunotherapy displayed significantly increased ATF6α activation compared with those with a weaker response. Targeting Atf6 through germline ablation, hepatocyte-specific ablation or therapeutic hepatocyte delivery of antisense oligonucleotides dampened HCC in preclinical liver cancer models. Thus, prolonged ATF6α activation drives ER stress, leading to glycolysis-dependent immunosuppression in liver cancer and sensitizing to ICB. Our findings suggest that persistently activated ATF6α is a tumour driver, a potential stratification marker for ICB response and a therapeutic target for HCC. ATF6α activation in human and preclinical models of hepatocellular carcinoma is significantly associated with an aggressive tumour phenotype characterized by reduced survival, glycolytic reprogramming and local immunosuppression."

 The loss of fur during human evolution has long mystified scientists and the public1–5. Reduced hair density coincides with acquisition of epidermal rete ridges, the developmental timing and molecular mechanisms of which are poorly understood despite their prominence in humans1,6–9. Examination of human and pig skin development has shown that rete ridges form through a mechanism independent from those of hair follicles10,11 and sweat glands3,4,12–15 by establishing interconnected epidermal invaginations. Here we document the occurrence of rete ridges across Mammalia, including in grizzly bears and dolphins, and show that neonatal pig wounds can regenerate them de novo. Multispecies spatiotemporal transcriptomics identifies significant signalling interactions between epidermal and dermal cells during rete ridge morphogenesis, particularly through bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP). We also demonstrate that mouse fingerpad skin forms rete ridges and functionally requires epidermal BMP signalling. We propose that evolution of rete ridges in mammalian skin involved replacement of the molecular program for formation of discrete microscopic appendages, including hair follicles and sweat glands, with a distinct program for the interconnected appendage network. Broad epidermal activation of BMP is required for the development of rete ridge networks organized around underlying dermal pockets. Understanding rete ridge mechanisms may enable development of therapeutic approaches to regenerate epidermal appendages lost during wounding or disease in humans. A spatial and single-cell transcriptomics study across multiple mammalian species identifies epidermal BMP signalling as a functional requirement for rete ridge formation, providing insight into mechanisms underlying hair density loss and wound healing."

 Multiple mosquito species serve as competent vectors to carry and transmit numerous flaviviruses1,2. Several long-standing scientific questions remain to be answered, including identification of the fundamental factors that facilitate flavivirus infectivity in mosquitoes and the genetic basis that contributes to the naturally occurring interspecies specificity of mosquitoes to flaviviruses3–8, such as Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to dengue virus (DENV). Here we report that circulating mature virions are inactivated by the acidity of mosquito haemolymph; thus, extracellular vesicles carrying replication-competent viral nucleocapsids serve as the predominant means of intercellular viral dissemination. Mechanistically, mosquito valosin-containing protein (VCP) binds to the viral capsid, thereby allowing the incorporation of nucleocapsids into extracellular vesicles. The capsid of a flavivirus (such as DENV) selectively binds to the VCP of its natural vector (Ae. aegypti), but not to that of an incompetent vector (for example, Culex quinquefasciatus). Replacing the DENV capsid with that of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) renders DENV infectious in the haemolymph of the natural JEV vector, Cx. quinquefasciatus. Furthermore, two amino residues in Aedes (D723/N728) and Culex (E723/E728) VCP determine its binding specificity for viral capsid, thus contributing to interspecies specificity of mosquitoes to flaviviruses. In vivo ectopic expression of the Cx. quinquefasciatus VCP mutant E723D/E728N renders Cx. quinquefasciatus susceptible to DENV2 via intrathoracic microinjection. Our study provides a major molecular mechanism contributing to the selectivity and compatibility between mosquito vectors and flavivirus species, enabling systemic virus dissemination after the virus reaches the haemocoel. Upstream mechanisms that determine specificity at the midgut level remain to be determined. Systemic flavivirus dissemination in mosquitoes following initial infection requires protein–protein interactions within extracellular vesicles, which enable infectious particles to be transported through haemolymph and confer species specificity."

 Photoreceptor proteins regulate fundamental biological processes such as vision, photosynthesis and circadian rhythms1. A large photoreceptor subfamily uses vitamin B12 derivatives for light sensing2, contrasting with the well-established mode of action of these organometallic derivatives in thermally activated enzymatic reactions3. The exact molecular mechanism of B12 photoreception and how this differs from the thermal pathways remains unknown. Here we provide a detailed description of photoactivation in the prototypical B12 photoreceptor CarH4,5 from nanoseconds to seconds, combining time-resolved and temperature-resolved structural and spectroscopic methods with quantum chemical calculations. Building on the crystal structures of the initial tetrameric dark and final monomeric light-activated states5, our structural snapshots of key intermediates in the truncated B12-binding domain illustrate how photocleavage of a cobalt–carbon (Co–C) bond within the B12 chromophore adenosylcobalamin triggers a series of structural changes that propagate throughout CarH. Breakage of the photolabile Co–C5′ bond leads to the formation of a previously unknown adduct that links the C4′ position of the adenosyl moiety to the Co ion and can subsequently be cleaved thermally over longer timescales to allow release of the adenosyl group, ultimately causing tetramer dissociation4,5. This adduct, which differentiates CarH from thermally activated B12 enzymes, steers the photoactivation pathway and acts as the molecular bridge between photochemical and photobiological timescales. The biological relevance of our study is corroborated by kinetic data on full-length CarH in the presence of DNA. Our results offer a spatiotemporal understanding of CarH photoactivation and pave the way for designing B12-dependent photoreceptors for optogenetic applications. Spatiotemporal insight into photoactivation of the prototypical B12 photoreceptor CarH is revealed across nine orders of magnitude in time, identifying a transient adduct that distinguishes it from thermally activated B12 enzymes."

 Telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assembly is the ultimate goal for de novo genome assembly. Existing algorithms1,2 capable of near-T2T assembly all require Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) ultra-long reads, which are costly and experimentally challenging to obtain and are thus often unavailable for samples without established cell lines3. Here we introduce hifiasm (ONT), an algorithm that can produce near-T2T assemblies from standard ONT simplex reads, eliminating the need for ultra-long sequencing. Compared with existing methods, hifiasm (ONT) reduces computational demands by an order of magnitude and reconstructs more chromosomes from telomere to telomere on the same datasets. This advance substantially broadens the feasibility of T2T assembly for applications previously limited by the high cost and experimental requirement of ultra-long reads.

The precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement4 remains a profound open question in quantum chromodynamics (QCD)—the fundamental theory of strong interaction. High-energy proton–proton collisions could liberate virtual quark–antiquark pairs from the vacuum that subsequently undergo confinement to form hadrons, whose properties could serve as probes into QCD confinement and the quark condensate.

Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental model for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement.

 Chemically reactive microbial natural products have enabled therapeutic development1 via their well-established anticancer, antibiotic and antioxidant activities. However, discovery of reactive metabolites is particularly challenging because they may not tolerate traditional bioactivity-guided isolation workflows2. Diazo-containing natural products are a subset of highly reactive microbial metabolites that display potent bioactivity3 and enable powerful biosynthetic transformations4,5; however, instability of the diazo group to light6, heat7, mild acid8 and mechanical shock9 has precluded their efficient discovery and application. Here we develop a reactivity-based screening approach to capture diazo-containing metabolites and facilitate their discovery by mass spectrometry. This workflow revealed two novel diazo-containing natural products, 4-diazo-3-oxobutanoic acid (1) and diazoacetone (2), from the human lung pathogen Nocardia ninae. Biosynthetic investigations revealed a distinct enzymatic logic for diazo formation involving hydrazone oxidation catalysed by the metalloenzyme Dob3, and its biochemical characterization suggests promising future applications in biocatalysis. Overall, our work highlights the power of reactivity-guided strategies for identifying reactive metabolites and facilitating the discovery of unique enzymatic transformations.

Here, authors use electrophysiological, optical and computational methods to investigate the structural changes that drive Kv7.4-channel opening, and how these are impaired by a deafness-causing mutation 
 KCNQ4-encoded KV7.4 voltage-gated potassium channels are expressed in hair-cells of the inner ear. Loss-of-function variants in KCNQ4 cause non-syndromic progressive hearing loss (DFNA2). KV7.4 pore opening requires voltage-dependent conformational changes (activation) of the voltage-sensor domains (VSDs); however, how fast charge displacement during VSD activation is coupled to slow channel opening is currently unclear. Here, we optically tracked KV7.4 VSD activation with voltage-clamp fluorometry, leveraging two fluorophores and pulsed excitation, and found that VSD activation comprises several voltage-dependent transitions, some with kinetics and voltage-dependence matching those of channel opening and closing. The DFNA2-causing R216H mutation impairs VSD movement and channel opening by destabilizing the active VSD configuration, a result confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. We propose that the KV7.4 VSD activates in two steps: a fast movement representing a first transition to an intermediate activation state, followed by slower component(s) that fully activate the VSD and drive channel opening. Kv7.4 channels regulate auditory function.

This study shows that residual sex in apomictic hickories causes recombination-driven loss of heterozygosity that exposes harmful mutations to selection and helps maintain clonality. 
 Apomixis, a form of clonal asexual reproduction in plants, is often accompanied by residual sex, yet its genomic consequences remain poorly understood. Here, we assembled a haplotype-resolved genome of Carya hunanensis and analyzed whole-genome resequencing data from 195 adults and 180 mature embryos across four hickory species, representing a hybrid apomictic complex with both sexual and asexual lineages. We find apomictic species exhibited genomic signatures of clonality, notably loss of heterozygosity (LOH), suggesting recombination induced by rare sexual events. Despite harboring more heterozygous deleterious variants, apomictic adults showed lower realized mutation loads, particularly in hybrid C. hunanensis, whose apomictic haplotype disproportionately carried deleterious alleles. Remarkably, rare embryos from apomicts underwent recombination-mediated LOH, exposing deleterious mutations to selection. These findings reveal the genetic cost of residual sex, while also indicating its role in generating novel genotypes, supported by close relatedness among adult apomicts. Our study provides a unique genomic snapshot of how residual sex and recombination mitigate mutation accumulation and potentially facilitate clonal maintenance in natural asexual systems. Apomixis allows plants to reproduce clonally, yet it is unclear how rare sexual events shape their genomes. This study shows that residual sex in apomictic hickories causes recombination-driven loss of heterozygosity that exposes harmful mutations to selection and helps maintain clonality."

 Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are crucial for cancer immunosurveillance. While mouse type 1 ILCs (ILC1s) control acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by targeting leukemia stem cells (LSCs), the role of human ILC1s in AML remains largely undefined. Here, we find that ILC1s in AML patients are impaired, with reduced total ILC1 numbers and diminished function. In contrast, healthy donor (HD) ILC1s-derived TNFα inhibits the leukemic transition from CD34+CD38+ to CD34−CD38+ cells and blocks the differentiation of LSCs (CD34+CD38−) into immunosuppressive, macrophage-like leukemia-supporting cells. HD ILC1-derived IFNγ partially suppresses the differentiation of CD34−CD38+ to CD34−CD38− cells. These combined effects limit human leukemogenesis in vivo. We also identify a human ILC1 subset as Lin−CD127+CD161−CRTH2−CD117− (CD161− ILC1s) that can be generated from umbilical cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. This method could provide a reliable source of ILC1s for potential adoptive transfer therapies in AML, offering a therapeutic approach to prolong disease-free survival in AML.

 The practical implementation of lithium metal batteries is hindered by unstable electrode-electrolyte interfaces and sluggish ion transport kinetics. Here, we report a molecular design strategy that remodels electrolyte solvation structures via the formation of hydrogen-bonded domains, thereby enhancing both the thermodynamics and interfacial dynamics of Li+ transport. Specifically, we introduce 2-cyano-N-methylacetamide, an electrochemically stable hydrogen bond donor, as a cosolvent to construct stable nanoscale hydrogen-bonded domains ( < 3.5 Å). 2-Cyano-N-methylacetamide generates both classical (H-bond, Hδ⁺–Oδ⁻) and nonclassical (Z-bond, Nδ⁻–Hδ⁺) hydrogen bonding, which disrupts loosely bound solvated clusters and induces tightly coordinated Li+ solvation structures. The hydrogen-bonded domains facilitate the formation of oriented fast Li+ transport channels. Accordingly, in Li | |LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells cycled under demanding conditions of 4.7 V with a high areal capacity of ~3.0 mAh cm−2, the electrolyte enables a capacity retention of 78.8% after 400 cycles.

 Excessive crop nitrogen (N) fertilization has negative environmental and social consequences. Using maize grain yield response to nitrogen field trials, we consider the uncertainty surrounding N rate recommendations to demonstrate that fertilizer N rates can be reduced by 12─16% in the US Corn Belt, with negligible risk of maize yield losses. This reduction in N fertilizer applications decrease N2O–N emissions by 10% and N leaching by 13%, leading to a social benefit of 230─$530 M, due to enhanced air and water quality. Additional N reductions could benefit ecosystems and human health. However, the high risk of yield loss associated with additional N reductions makes this practice unacceptable for farmers. This emphasizes the need for incentive programs that consider the responsibilities and limitations of all actors along the food supply chain.

 Previous studies have noted that cities enhance cloud cover, but the mechanisms of urban morphological types on cloud formation remain elusive. Observations of cloud climatology from 44 major U.S. cities show that cloud enhancement increases with the street-canyon aspect ratio and decreases with building density. Here, to explain these observations, we conducted numerical experiments using urban morphology-resolving large-eddy simulations. In these simulations, urban and rural surfaces retain their respective heat-flux differences, while the moisture sources and background atmospheric water vapor are prescribed to be identical, allowing us to isolate the morphological controls on moist convection. Results show that urban morphology influences cloud formation through two mechanisms: taller buildings intensify urban-breeze circulations at the urban-rural interface, while denser buildings, acting as momentum sinks, reduce vertical turbulent transport at the urban core. These vertical motions modify the transport of moisture in the urban atmospheric boundary layer, causing different cloud amounts across different urban morphology. This study highlights the mechanistic link between urban form, vertical motions, and cloud enhancement, thus providing a basis for city-specific boundary-layer convective parameterizations in large-scale weather and climate models. Using cloud observations from 44 US cities and large-eddy simulations, this study shows that taller buildings strengthen urban-breeze updrafts, while denser buildings suppress vertical turbulence, together reshaping moisture transport and cloud formation in urban environments."

It captures long range gene context in single Cell transcriptomics. 
 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity by providing gene expression data at single-cell resolution, uncovering insights into rare cell populations, cell-cell interactions, and gene regulation. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale scRNA-seq datasets have shown great promise in analyzing such data, but existing approaches are often limited to modeling a small subset of highly expressed genes and lack the integration of external gene-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we present scLong, a billion-parameter foundation model pretrained on 48 million cells. scLong performs self-attention across the entire set of 28,000 genes in the human genome. This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies between all genes, including lowly expressed ones (containing unexpressed genes with zero expressions), which often play critical roles in cellular processes but are typically excluded by existing foundation models. Additionally, scLong integrates gene knowledge from the Gene Ontology using a graph convolutional network, enriching its contextual understanding of gene functions and relationships. In extensive evaluations, scLong surpasses both state-of-the-art scRNA-seq foundation models and task-specific models across diverse tasks, including predicting transcriptional responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, forecasting cancer drug responses, and inferring gene regulatory networks.

 Most tropical cyclones (TCs) originate from tropical disturbances over the western North Pacific (WNP). This study examines the tropical disturbances that developed into TCs and their relationship with maximum attained intensity. Using data from 1981 to 2020, we reveal that 29.1% of developing disturbances originated from Mixed Rossby–Gravity (MRG) waves. Compared with other origins, MRG-originated TCs intensify faster, produce more super typhoons, and reach higher lifetime maximum intensity (LMI). These developing systems typically form farther southeast and follow prolonged northwestward tracks, benefiting from a longer pre-LMI oceanic trajectory and greater exposure to favorable large-scale conditions, including warmer sea surface temperature, greater mid-level moisture, stronger convection and weaker vertical wind shear. Following their formation, the disturbances co-propagate westward with the MRG wave packet, which itself does not dissipate. 81.8% of these disturbances remain within the MRG wave packet until reaching their LMI, for an average duration of 3.7 days. The MRG wave packet provides favorable conditions for disturbance development, including warmer sea surface temperatures, enhanced moisture supply, reduced vertical wind shear, and stronger upper-level divergence—features that collectively promote intensification. Furthermore, the proportion of TCs statistically associated with MRG-related disturbances shows a significant increasing trend, underscoring an increasingly important role of MRG wave environments in modulating TC intensity."

Anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) in the extra-polar oceans is recognized as one of the principal drivers of Arctic sea ice variability. However, the relative importance of SST anomalies across different ocean basins remains uncertain. Here, we employ a deep neural network (DNN) model to reconstruct Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) variability independently using the observational daily SST anomaly fields in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. We find that the Atlantic SST-based DNN produces the best and most stable reconstruction of Arctic SIE, a result that cannot be achieved by a linear regression model. In particular, based on explainable AI techniques, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf Stream are identified as key regions where SST variability has the most pronounced influence on Arctic SIE. The superiority of DNN over the regression model in SIE reconstruction elucidates the integral role of Atlantic SST interannual variability in modulating Arctic sea ice, likely through the SST-driven latent heat flux anomalies in those key regions. These findings highlight the importance of interannual Atlantic SST variations to Arctic sea ice variability, underpinned by the ability of DNN to capture their complex teleconnections."

 Glaciers in Alaska contribute greatly to sea-level rise and are losing mass at a faster rate than any other region. Yet, our understanding of ongoing changes and ability to model them are hindered by a lack of observations, particularly at high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we leverage Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to produce temporally-varying glacier melt extents and snowlines from mid-2016 to 2024 for 99% of glaciers in Alaska greater than 2 km2. The melt extents are strongly correlated with temperatures, revealing that each 1°C increase in summer temperature causes up to 3 additional weeks of glacier melt. The high spatiotemporal resolution also captures subseasonal changes such as the 2019 heat wave, which caused subregional snowlines to retreat up to 105 m higher and exposed up to 28% more of the underlying glacier compared to typical years. Our snowlines agree well with optical datasets (r2 up to 0.94), thus providing unprecedented reliable data unencumbered by clouds or lighting conditions. Moving forward, our automated, open-source workflow can easily be applied to other regions. These data also present unique opportunities to calibrate and validate large-scale glacier evolution models, a critical step for improving projections of glacier changes and their impacts."

 Invasive species affect freshwater ecosystems and economies worldwide, with their dispersal facilitated by human activities such as shipping and large water transfer projects. Here, we use the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) as a model species and develop an integrated framework that combines a dispersal model for introduction risk with a species distribution model for establishment risk, using global shipping routes and water diversion projects as the main pathways. Our simulations reveal an expansion of high-risk basins over time, particularly after the 1990s, with coastal basins acting as invasion bridgeheads from which populations can spread inland. Several basins in North America, Europe, Australia, the Indochina Peninsula and the Amazon basin, although not yet invaded, emerge as environmentally suitable and increasingly connected, indicating elevated future invasion risk. Our study highlights the importance of implementing management strategies for invasive species, such as ballast water treatment and installing prevention measures in water diversion/transfer schemes.

 Over the past few decades, China’s cropland configuration has changed markedly, with important implications for food security and agricultural sustainability. Here we examine how cropland spatial-temporal concentration relates to agricultural intensification across China from 2000 to 2020. We mapped cropland distribution for five benchmark years using Google Earth Engine platform and 234,804 Landsat images and quantified cropland landscape configuration. These data were combined with provincial statistics on crop yield, fertilizer application, irrigation water use, and agricultural machinery power. We find that cropland experienced a contraction phase from 2000 to 2015 followed by a recovery phase after 2015. During contraction, increases in crop production commonly coincided with rising fertilizer and machinery inputs, whereas during recovery these inputs declined in most regions, alongside increased cropland contiguity. Overall, agricultural intensification in China became more sustainable by reducing reliance on fertilizer and machinery inputs and placing greater emphasis on cropland-use efficiency and environmental protection.

 African savannas are experiencing a rapid decline in burned area, often entailing a simplification of landscape pyrodiversity. We used virtual landscapes generated from data collected in a multi-decadal fire experiment to test how pyrodiversity (measured as spatial variation in fire frequency) shapes multiple dimensions of three savannas spanning a rainfall gradient in South Africa. Results provide empirical evidence that pyrodiversity begets diversity across structural, functional, and taxonomic dimensions, especially at precipitation ≥650 mm yr⁻1. The positive effects of pyrodiversity arise because patches with different fire frequencies form a diverse landscape mosaic. Critically, the highest woody encroachment, carbon storage, soil nitrogen and woody species diversity was found in low fire frequency patches. On the contrary, the most diverse ground vegetation communities were detected in frequently burned patches. Our findings emphasize the importance of pyrodiversity-based management for maintaining ecosystem diversity and associated services in the face of ongoing environmental changes.

 Rapid urbanization exacerbates conflicts between land expansion and ecosystem preservation, particularly in urban agglomerations, posing challenges to sustainable urban development. Nevertheless, existing research often overlooks the three-dimensional urbanization process. Here we established a framework for coupling coordination degree analysis based on meta-coupling theory to explore relationships between three-dimensional urbanization (both horizontal and vertical dimensions) and multiple ecosystem services, using 19 major urban agglomerations in China from 2005 to 2020 as case studies. The results reveal that, although the coupling coordination degree has generally improved, some urban agglomerations (e.g., Chengdu-Chongqing and Qianzhong) have experienced degradation, and several western and inland regions show persistent or worsening imbalances. Differences between regions are the main contributors to overall variation, yet cross-regional coupling coordination is strengthening. These findings underscore the importance of strengthening inter-regional cooperation by leveraging the spillover influence of advanced cities to support resource sharing—such as ecological data, technology, and restoration funding—and policy alignment in land-use planning and ecological compensation, thereby supporting more balanced and sustainable development.

 Time-series analysis is a crucial component of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) pixel offset tracking (POT), directly impacting the accuracy of deformation monitoring. However, most existing time-series approaches struggle with precise long-term monitoring, particularly for landslide experiencing long-term large deformation. The widely used Pixel Offset–Small Baseline Subset (PO-SBAS) method supports long-term analysis but often underestimates deformation in high-gradient regions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Robust Sequential Pixel Offset Tracking (RS-POT) method. RS-POT initially derives short-term deformations using a single-reference POT approach, then sequentially integrates them into a complete deformation time series through a robust fusion strategy. This ensures both long-term continuity and high accuracy in capturing large deformations. Simulation results show that RS-POT provides accurate deformation estimates in 94.42% of the study area. In a case study of the Qiantaishan landslide, RS-POT outperforms PO-SBAS through reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) with reference to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements by 51.51% in the azimuth direction and 43.61% in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction. Additionally, due to fewer image pairs being required, RS-POT improves computational efficiency by 122% compared to PO-SBAS. Further simulations confirm that RS-POT performs reliably under large-gradient deformation conditions, and it is applicable to various landslide types, including traction, thrust, and homogeneous landslides. These results demonstrate that RS-POT offers a more accurate and efficient solution for long-term landslide deformation monitoring."

 Reliable mapping of windthrow, a common abiotic disturbance in Canadian forests, is crucial for effective forest management and conservation, and remote sensing is becoming a useful tool for this purpose. Due to the spectral similarity of disturbances like windthrow, logging, and insect outbreaks, pixel-based approaches show limitations for accurate windthrow detection at large scales, underscoring the need for a method to distinguish windthrow events across the Canadian boreal forest. In this study, we developed and evaluated a new approach to detect windthrow-affected forest areas, primarily in the boreal forests of Eastern Canada, covering over 90 million hectares from 2019 to 2024. The method integrates deep learning (DL) models with 10 m Sentinel-2 annual composites and incorporates the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm to improve timestamp estimation. We trained and evaluated the performance of machine and DL approaches, namely, LinkNet, CResU-Net, ResU-Net, DeepLabv3+, and Random Forest. Among them, CResU-Net, an enhanced variant of ResU-Net with a convolutional block attention module, demonstrated the best performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.79%, a producer’s accuracy of 75.31%, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 58.7% using reference data from a major windthrow event in Canada, the May 2022 Canadian derecho. Including CCDC improved our yearly timestamp to monthly timestamp for 63% of the windthrow affected area with a delay of 1–2 months relative to the event. A historical windthrow map from 2019 to 2024 was generated, highlighting the potential of combining DL and Sentinel-2 imagery for accurate and scalable windthrow detection and characterization."

 Frequent and severe wildfires driven by climate change intensify the need for accurate burned area (BA) mapping, which can be effectively addressed using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) due to its cloud-penetration capability and sensitivity to vegetation and moisture changes. However, BA mapping based on SAR-only approaches relies on U-Net with ResNet50 backbone or fully convolutional neural network, while the potential of advanced architectural components remains underexplored. Moreover, prior research primarily emphasizes log-ratio features, with limited focus on standalone capacity of dual polarized vegetation indices (VIs). This study addresses these gaps by evaluating the performance of five U-Net variants (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Residual Attention U-Net, U-Net++, and U-Net 3 +) using four input schemes: log-ratio, log-ratio without cross-ratio, VIs, and a combined feature set of all. Three combinations of loss function such as binary cross entropy (BCE), dice, and focal are also applied to the best model of all scheme. Experimental results show that U-Net++ with log-ratio inputs under BCE loss function achieves the highest performance, yielding an F1 score of 0.8218 and an Intersection of Union (IoU) of 0.6795. Further analysis reveals that VIs alone can effectively delineate burned areas (F1: 0.8244; IoU: 0.7013) with focal loss, and combining them with log-ratio features delivers the best performance (F1: 0.8364; IoU: 0.7188), when dice and focal loss functions are applied. Overall, this study offers a quantitative evaluation of how dual-polarized VIs and deep learning architectures affect SAR-based BA mapping performance and suggests promising directions for future enhancement through advanced feature extraction techniques."

 Seasonal climate forecasts are inherently uncertain due to the chaotic nature of the climate system and the limitations of predictive models. Quantifying and decomposing this uncertainty are essential for reliable forecasts.

Training is conducted with ERA5 reanalysis and historical simulations from 18 CMIP6 models, followed by validation and testing with ERA5 data over South America. We decompose predictive uncertainty into ML-aleatoric (data-related) and ML-epistemic (model-related) components. Results show that ML-aleatoric uncertainty dominates, being on average two orders of magnitude larger than ML-epistemic uncertainty. ERA5-trained models exhibit lower aleatoric uncertainty but are often overconfident and not well-calibrated, whereas CMIP6-trained models show higher aleatoric uncertainty but improved calibration. Models trained with continuous targets achieve lower uncertainty than categorical models, which lose information through discretization. Probabilistic accuracy, evaluated via Ranked Probability Score (RPS), indicates that CMIP6-based models trained with continuous targets and Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) loss perform best overall. Seasonal analysis reveals better calibration in austral summer (DJF) compared to winter (JJA), consistent with stronger teleconnection signals during summer. Finally, case studies of El Niño, La Niña, and neutral years demonstrate that forecast confidence and uncertainty strongly depend on the training dataset and target representation."

 Reliable characterization of nighttime cloud cover (CC) remains challenging due to the limited availability of long-term ground-based observations and the lack of coordinated multi-instrument measurements. This study presents a coordinated nighttime cloud observation framework that integrates standardized ground-based camera systems with collocated meteorological measurements, lidar-derived cloud base height (CBH), pyrgeometer-based net longwave radiation, and Himawari satellite’s CC across four sites in East Asia — Chiba, Toyama, Shiga (Japan), and Taoyuan (Taiwan). A continuous six-year nighttime CC record is available at the Chiba site that can be used to assess of seasonal variability and cloud-environment relationships. Unlike previous studies that rely on single instruments or isolated locations, this work systematically analyzes nighttime CC in relation to near-surface temperature, relative humidity (RH), cloud base height, and longwave radiation using a unified methodology. In persistently humid conditions such as Taoyuan, enhanced atmospheric water vapor suppresses the increase of CC with near-ground temperature. At the same site, net longwave radiation increases by 1.778 W m−2 per 1% increase in CC. In Chiba, a pronounced decrease in CC with increasing CBH (approximately −4.931% km−1). These results exhibit the value of coordinated multi-site nighttime observations using standardized ground-based instrumentation. The study provides a methodological foundation for expanding nighttime cloud monitoring networks and offers observational constraints useful for validating satellite-based nighttime CC and improving the representation of nighttime clouds in atmospheric models."

To counteract NKG2A inhibitory signaling, we identified two specific fully human monoclonal anti-NKG2A antibodies that block HLA-E ligand binding. These antibodies activated NK cells and enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumor-targeting IgG1s both in vitro and in vivo. Bispecific engagers (BiNKs), generated by fusing NKG2A antibodies with tumor targeting binders, promoted immune synapse formation and directed cytotoxicity of NK and CD8+T cells toward cancer cells. In a human PBMC-engrafted NSG mouse xenograft lung cancer model, an anti-HER2 × anti-NKG2A BiNK markedly inhibited tumor growth as a monotherapy or in combination with pertuzumab.

However, understanding the ultrafast spin-electron-lattice coupled dynamics remains challenging, especially when the system is driven far from equilibrium. Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast light-induced spin-flip within 300 fs in Fe3GeTe2, a prototypical two-dimensional itinerant ferromagnet. Notably, by varying the laser fluence, we identify three distinct regimes that emerge assisted by a photoinduced single linear phonon mode, namely demagnetization, spin-flip, and spin-melting. We resolve the dominant role of displacively excited A1gphonons, while nonequilibrium electron occupation is essential to break the degeneracy of the spin up and down states and lower the spin-flip energy barrier. Accompanying the spin-flip, we also observe a sign change of the Berry curvature, implying involvement of nontrivial band topology. Our results provide a general guidance for optical manipulation of spin orders, holding promises for advancing future spintronics and information technology."

In this ecological study, we used a doubly robust method, incorporating flexible generalized propensity score estimation that captured potential nonlinearity and interactions among confounders and relaxed the distribution form assumption for exposure, to estimate the effects of annual exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the contiguous United States from 2006 to 2020. We found that wildfire smoke PM2.5was associated with increased mortality rate for all studied outcomes, except for deaths from transport accidents or falls, which served as negative outcome controls. Wildfire smoke PM2.5was responsible for ~24,100 all-cause deaths per year in the contiguous United States. The exposure-response curve for all-cause mortality increased monotonically, with no evidence of a “safe” threshold. Among the six cause-specific outcomes, mortality from neurological disease showed the greatest increase per 0.1 μg/m3increase in smoke PM2.5exposure.

Here we incorporate realistic volcanic forcing into a large ensemble of glacial era–coupled atmosphere-ocean model simulations. These simulations are constrained by sulfate records from ice cores, which help estimate the timing of past major eruptions. We investigate how volcanic eruptions may have occasionally triggered abrupt climate change during the last glacial period. Our results show that very large equatorial eruptions can induce large changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation via atmospheric and ocean circulation changes and air-sea buoyancy fluxes, potentially pushing the climate system between persistent warm and cold states lasting millennia. A simplified perspective of the dynamics shows how unforced natural climate variability may exert a stabilizing influence decades after an eruption, especially as the system nears a tipping point."

The cell biological basis underlying hybrid incompatibility remains largely unknown, especially in mammals. Here, we found that female hybrids betweenMus musculus domesticusandMus spicilegusmice are sterile due to the failure of homologous-chromosome separation in oocyte meiosis, producing aneuploid eggs. This nondisjunction phenotype was driven by the mislocalization of the cohesin protector, SGO2, along the chromosome arms instead of its typical centromeric enrichment, resulting in cohesin overprotection. The upstream kinase, BUB1, showed a higher activity in hybrid oocytes, explaining SGO2 mistargeting. Higher BUB1 activity was not observed in mitosis, consistent with viable hybrid mice. Cohesion defects were also evident in hybrid mice from another genus,Peromyscus, wherein cohesin protection is weakened. Defective cohesion in oocytes is a leading cause of reduced fertility. Our work provides evidence that a major cause of human infertility may play a positive role in mammalian speciation."

We find that racial disparities in suspensions increased, particularly in neighborhoods experiencing substantial shifts in Black populations. These increases were especially pronounced in suburban and rural areas with shifting Black populations and all predominantly White neighborhoods. Although school discipline reforms aimed to reduce racial disparities, they only declined in certain types of neighborhoods, most notably in urban areas.

The samples included local basalts with an age of 2807 ± 3 million years and the norites with an age of 4247 ± 5 million years likely corresponding to the age of the South Pole–Aitken basin. With these radiometric ages, we refined the lunar chronology function (CF) and verified that it is still consistent with a combination of an exponential decrease and a linear rate. We further derived the impacting rate and found it supports a smooth decay instead of abrupt changes of the impactor flux at early times. The refined lunar CF can be used to obtain more reliable ages for unsampled lunar areas and provide critical constraint for the lunar early impact history."

Here, we identify a dual-functional ensemble within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that modulates both anxiety-like behaviors and insomnia through distinct neural circuits. Specifically, a subset of BNST neurons exhibits enhanced activity in response to anxiety-related cues and during wakefulness. Activation of these ensemble neurons exacerbates anxiety-like behaviors and reduces non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in chronic restraint stress (CRS) mice. Conversely, inactivation of these neurons alleviates anxiety-like behaviors and promotes NREM sleep. In addition, anxiolytic-hypnotic medication attenuates BNST stress ensemble hyperactivity, mitigating both phenotypes. Furthermore, BNST stress ensembles project divergently to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the preoptic area (POA): DRN-projecting neurons selectively modulated anxiety, whereas POA-projecting neurons specifically regulated sleep-wake states. These findings suggest that hyperactive BNST stress ensembles are responsible for inducing anxiety-like behaviors and disrupting sleep in CRS mice and achieve the modality specificity through their divergent downstream targets."

The ~250-micrometer flexible guidewire incorporates a 460-nanometer luminescent core with an enhanced optoacoustic signature and a FePt magnetic tip for precise, steerable control. Proof-of-concept studies show that OptoMaG can be actively navigated with external magnetic fields to traverse a 3D human-scale cerebrovascular phantom and accurately reach target brain sites. Beyond navigation, the FePt tip enables localized thermal ablation under remote radiofrequency stimulation, highlighting its theranostic potential for tumor treatment. In addition, OptoMaG functions as a light source for photodynamic therapy, selectively activating photosensitizers to destroy tumor cells while preserving healthy tissue. Collectively, OptoMaG provides a safe, radiation-free platform merging real-time navigation with targeted therapeutic capabilities."

However, whether and howC. albicanscauses remodeling of oral epithelial cell (OEC) metabolism is unclear. Here, we use in vitro experiments and patient biopsies to demonstrate that OECs undergo metabolic reprogramming when infected byC. albicansindependently of candidalysin secretion, increasing glycolysis and decreasing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. Glycolysis and glucose transport inhibition show that these pathways support OEC cytokine release, highlighting the partial control of antifungal epithelial immunity by cellular metabolism. However, glucose supplementation disrupts OEC responses both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the fungus benefits from these metabolic shifts and that increased aerobic glycolysis in OECs is detrimental. Genome-scale metabolic modeling predicted a shutdown of the TCA cycle and a previously unidentified role for glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1) in response toC. albicans, which was subsequently shown to be important for OEC survival during infection. This study reveals a fundamental role for hexose metabolism and identifies a GOT1-mediated TCA cycle shunt in regulating OEC survival and immune responses during mucosal fungal infections."

We uncover 483 polymorphic NUMTs across globally diverse human populations and 10 in archaic genomes. By combining overlap with Neanderthal-derived and Denisovan-derived haplotypes, phylogenetic analyses, insertion time estimates, and haplotype colocalization, we identify five NUMTs introduced into modern humans via archaic hominin introgression. Functional analyses reveal that introgressed NUMTs can modulate gene expression, including allele-specific up-regulation of the immune-related geneRASGRP3, and reshape three-dimensional chromatin structure at loci such asSCD5andHNRNPD. These findings highlight an underappreciated mechanism by which archaic mitochondrial fragments shape nuclear genome function and evolution.

Here, we resolve this paradox by shifting from trait-level to state-level analysis. Leveraging a microtask design to measure daily fluctuations in cognitive function, goal setting and goal progress, mood, sleep, and motivation over a 12-week intensive longitudinal study of university students (N= 184, time points = 9248), we show that within-person upswings in domain-general cognitive processing precision precede and predict same-day self-reported goal setting and achievement across both academic and nonacademic domains, even controlling for other factors.

This result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a nonzero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on nonzero initial velocities. These results are a step toward the unraveling of nonequilibrium dynamics of fluids."

However, the immunological consequences of ultrasmall bioparticle–induced nanocollision remain largely an unexplored realm despite its ubiquitous and incessant occurrence within the in vivo milieu. Herein, we disclose that nanocollisions caused by endogenous bioparticles, such as extracellular vesicles, can induce localized membrane deformations. This spatially confined mechanical input activates Piezo1 at collision sites and promotes myosin IIA phosphorylation–mediated F-actin stabilization, enhancing DC intrinsic motility. Subsequent diffusion of Ca2+up-regulates chemotaxis machinery, improving their capacity of tumor microenvironment patrolling and lymph node homing for antitumor immunity. This finding reveals a previously unidentified mechanoimmunological mechanism of immune surveillance. To accelerate the translation of this mechanism into clinical therapeutics, we developed an ultrasound-responsive nanocollision generator using gas-liquid-solid triphase conversion. This system achieves precise nanocollision to augment DC locomotion, promoting antitumor immunity in vivo."

Arrenberg;Frank Jülicher;Rita Mateus,Injury-induced electrochemical coupling triggers organ growth,"Organ injury triggers nonneuronal electric currents essential for regeneration. However, the mechanisms by which electrical signals are generated, sensed, and transmitted upon damage to promote organ growth remain unclear. Here, we uncover that organ repair relies on dynamic electrochemical coupling between membrane potential depolarization and intracellular signaling, essential to activate cell proliferation. By subsecond live imaging of locally injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across time and space: a millisecond, long-range, membrane depolarization gradient, followed by second-persistent intracellular calcium responses. In the subsequent hour, voltage sensing phosphatase senses the injury-driven membrane potential change and autonomously translates the electric signal intracellularly, promoting tissue-wide cell proliferation. Connecting these dynamics with an electrodiffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fin’s interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading. Our work reveals the coupling between fast electrical signals and slower intracellular signaling, ensuring complete organ recovery."

The sparse material record of those myriad technologies limits our ability to formulate nuanced models about this critical period in human history. We present radiocarbon, Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry, and other taxonomic identification data from two of the largest Late Pleistocene perishable assemblages in the world, Cougar Mountain Cave and Paisley Caves, Oregon, US. These data include 66 radiocarbon dates on 55 items made from 15 different plant and animal taxa, including the oldest known physical remains of sewn hide. We provide data on eyed bone needles from four regional sites, showing that they are among the finest bone needles made in the Pleistocene. Our study illuminates the complex interplay of culture, climate, and technology in the Pleistocene."

Glud,Hydrostatic pressure induces strong leakage of dissolved organic matter from “marine snow” particles,"Marine snow forms at the ocean surface, sinks to depth, and ultimately enables carbon sequestration in the seabed. Fast-sinking marine snow particles, such as diatom aggregates, encounter a rapid increase in hydrostatic pressure during their descent. Using incubations in rotating pressure tanks, we found that pressure levels corresponding to 2- to 6-kilometer water depth induce leakage of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from diatom aggregates equivalent to ~50% of their initial carbon contents. The leaked DOM proved to be diatom-derived and changed the amount and composition of DOM in the surrounding seawater substantially. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, high protein-like fluorescence, and low carbon:nitrogen ratios classified the leaked DOM as labile. The bioavailability of leaked DOM was demonstrated by its rapid utilization by a pelagic microbial community, leaving mainly recalcitrant DOM behind. Pressure-induced DOM leakage likely weakens the gravitational “biological carbon pump” and supplies labile DOM to the pelagic microbiome of the deep ocean."

To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying SCRE2 virulence function, we identify that SCRE2 interacts withOryza sativaS-like ribonuclease family member OsRNS4. As a catalytically inactive RNase, OsRNS4 positively regulates rice immunity, depending on its RNA binding ability. OsRNS4 is unconventionally secreted through tetraspanin-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs). OsRNS4 binds to certain groups of rice miRNAs, whereas SCRE2 prevents the binding of OsRNS4 to miRNAs. Especially, OsRNS4-bound miR528-5p in rice is detected in false smut balls and silences the geneUvSfk1essential forU. virensvirulence. Thus, OsRNS4 might act as a carrier to transport miRNAs from rice into fungi, which target the virulence genes inU. virensand thereby contributes to rice resistance against fungal pathogens. As an unidentified counter-defense mechanism, SCRE2 suppresses cross-kingdom RNA interference to promote infection through inhibiting OsRNS4 binding to miRNAs."

While basally dividing progenitors are implicated in neocortical growth, their developmental origins and relevance beyond the cortex remain unclear. We show here that double inactivation of spindle orientation regulators GPSM2 and SAPCD2 in mice completely reorients progenitor divisions in both the neocortex and retina. This shift increases basal progenitors over sixfold in the neocortex and induces their ectopic emergence in the retina, resulting in extra cell layers and ~30% tissue enlargement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the induced basal progenitors in the cortex resemble human outer radial glia, and both cortical and retinal progenitors show altered Hippo signaling. Last, macaque and human retinas display twice as many reoriented divisions as the mouse and naturally contain basal progenitors. These findings show that division orientation is critical for regulating neural progenitor output and scaling tissue growth."

Taher A. Saif,Self-modifying percolation governs detachment in soft suction wet adhesion,"Aquatic animals such as octopuses use soft suction cups to solve the persistent challenge of wet attachment on rough surfaces. Detachment has long been described as smooth drainage governed by a Reynolds-type pressure gradient. Combining spatiotemporal pressure mapping with confocal imaging of the fluid layer between a suction cup-substrate interface, we reveal a two-stage, nonequilibrium pathway for pressure equalization that challenges this conventional view. Suction-induced elastic deformation dynamically remodels the interfacial fluid, producing a self-coupled pressure channel system. Stage I is governed by an outward-moving invasion-percolation suction front with diffusion-like scaling. When internal suction falls below a critical value, the network opens globally, and stage II follows classical Poiseuille drainage. This mechanism defines a self-modifying percolation in which the flow remodels its own pathways, which advances our understanding of biological suction and viscous adhesion and suggests design principles for long-lived wet adhesives and hydrogel microfluidics."

However, severe optical scattering and high-frequency acoustic attenuation within the brain degrade the performance of photoacoustic brain imaging. To address such limitation, we propose a line scanning–based photoacoustic computed mesoscopic (PACMes) approach for noninvasive, high-resolution, and longitudinal visualization of cerebral vasculature inside the intact mouse brain. This technique uses converging near-infrared (NIR) lines scanned at multiple angles for tight optical excitation; a low-frequency, full-ring ultrasound transducer array for high-sensitivity detection; and a compound reconstruction algorithm integrating filtered back-projection and optical localization of photoacoustic signals to recover the image. We perform long-term (>5 months), noninvasive imaging of the entire cortex of mice through the intact scalp and skull with a field of view of 13 millimeters and a spatial resolution of 33 micrometers. The results demonstrate the potential of PACMes for investigating brain function and disease."
