10.1088/1748-9326/ad8245,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文主要关注东亚地区近几十年来暖季陆地和海洋的干燥趋势。文章利用1980年至2022年的降水-蒸发(P-E)数据，结合水分收支分解和数值实验，分析了东亚地区特别是中国东南部和黄海区域的干旱化现象。研究结果表明，中国东南部地区的干旱化主要由动力过程驱动，特别是与风变化相关的湿度辐散，这与印度-太平洋暖池变暖引起的异常下沉运动有关；而黄海及邻近海域的干旱化则受热力学湿度平流的影响，全球变暖导致的西北太平洋边缘海SST升高和中国内陆地区SST降低，驱动着干空气通过背景西南风从中国内陆输送至黄海。该研究使用了遥感技术和卫星观测数据，对大气成分（湿度、温度等）和环流变化进行分析，揭示了东亚地区陆地和海洋干旱化趋势的成因及其差异，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['precipitation', 'evaporation', 'moisture budget', 'sea surface temperature (SST)', 'wind changes', 'atmospheric circulation', 'satellite observations', 'remote sensing', 'drying trend', 'climate change']",Go-Un Kim;Hyoeun Oh;Jin-Yong Jeong,Drying trend in land and sea in East Asia during the warm season over the past four decades,"The East Asian region is typically characterized by warm and humid conditions from late spring to summer. However, in recent decades, this region has experienced an increase in severe drying conditions, deviating from historical climatological patterns. This study investigated the precipitation − evaporation (P − E) trends across land and sea regions in East Asia (EA) during the extended summer season (April–September) from 1980 to 2022, and the key physical processes driving these trends through moisture budget decomposition and numerical experiments. The results reveal pronounced drying trends in southeastern China and the Yellow Sea and parts of the Korea Strait and Korean Peninsula over the past 43 years. The underlying physical processes driving these drying conditions differ between land and sea in EA. In southeastern China, the drying is driven by dynamic processes, particularly moisture divergence related to wind changes. This is linked to anomalous strengthening of descending motion due to the Indo-Pacific warm pool warming induced by both anthropogenic global warming and natural Pacific Decadal Oscillation-like sea surface temperature (SST) patterns. Conversely, drying in the Yellow Sea and adjacent areas is influenced by thermodynamic moisture advection. The altered humidity distribution due to global warming-induced SST patterns, which are higher over the Northwest Pacific marginal sea and lower in inland China, drives dry air transport from inland China to the Yellow Sea via background southwesterly wind. These findings enhance our understanding of the drying trend and their distinct processes in EA’s land and sea areas during the extended summer."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8506,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是如何利用遥感技术和神经网络模型估算全球尺度的蒸腾量。蒸腾量是陆地生态系统水分循环的重要组成部分，准确估算它对气候变化研究和水资源管理至关重要。该研究提出了一种结合Priestley-Taylor模型和人工神经网络的新方法，利用全球可获取的遥感数据（如土壤湿度、水汽压差、风速等）和来自SAPFLUXNET的全球树液流动测量网络数据，避免了对气孔导度的参数化，提高了蒸腾量估算的精度。该方法减少了对地面观测数据的依赖，并通过将实测数据放大到更大尺度，解决了蒸腾量产品稀缺的问题。研究结果表明，该模型在不同森林生态系统中具有较高的估算精度，并且蒸腾量在全球ET中的平均贡献率为55.2%。总的来说，这项研究利用了遥感技术，并结合机器学习方法，在全球尺度上对蒸腾量进行了更准确的估算，这对于理解陆气相互作用和气候变化具有重要意义。,"['Evapotranspiration', 'Transpiration', 'Remote sensing', 'Satellite observations', 'Land surface temperature', 'Soil moisture', 'Vapor pressure deficit', 'Wind speed', 'Global scale']",Marco Hannemann;Almudena García-García;Rafael Poyatos;Miguel D Mahecha;Jian Peng,Estimating transpiration globally by integrating the Priestley-Taylor model with neural networks,"Transpiration (T), the component of evapotranspiration (ET) controlled by the vegetation, dominates terrestrial ET in many ecosystems; however, estimating it accurately, especially at the global scale, remains a considerable challenge. Existing approaches mostly rely on the relationship between T and photosynthesis, but untangling this relationship is difficult and leads to diverging T estimates. Limited in-situ measurements and the inability to directly measure transpiration from space further complicate the reliable assessment of this crucial process in the terrestrial water cycle. Here, we developed a new hybrid Priestley–Taylor (PT) model combined with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using globally available remote sensing and reanalysis data of soil moisture, vapor pressure deficit and windspeed. We also take advantage of the newly released global sap flow measurement network SAPFLUXNET. In the proposed approach, we avoid the parameterization of stomatal conductance by training the ANN on the PT-Coefficient α, obtained by inverting the PT equation. The results showed that our model framework can estimate T in different forest ecosystems based on few predictors. By utilizing forcings from independent datasets, we eliminate the reliance on in-situ measurements for predicting T. Through upscaling actual observations to a larger scale, this model framework helps alleviate the scarcity of T products. Intercomparison of T with ET partitioning methods based on eddy covariance data, shows high performances (KGE of 0.69 in Europe and 0.60 in North America), slightly improving estimates compared to other models. Analysis of contribution of T to ET across 100 FLUXNET sites result in a global mean of 55.2%. We believe that modelling T independent from the carbon cycle can support our understanding of land-atmosphere feedbacks and climate extremes in future research."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8765,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了南非东部卡鲁地区不同草地类型的地表反照率（albedo）及其季节变化，以及放牧对反照率的影响。研究发现，不同草地类型、放牧强度和季节都会影响地表反照率，灌木入侵会降低反照率，从而可能增加地表温度，加剧气候变暖。该研究使用了地面测量仪器进行观测，并结合了卫星反照率产品。虽然没有直接使用大气成分分析技术，但研究结果与卫星遥感技术密切相关，因为卫星遥感可以用来大范围监测地表反照率，为气候变化研究提供数据支持。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术，特别是利用卫星观测地表参数从而进行气候变化研究，具有很强的关联性。,"['albedo', 'radiative forcing', 'satellite-based albedo products', 'remote sensing', 'land surface temperature']",S McGregor;J P G M Cromsigt;M te Beest;J Chen;D P Roy;H-J Hawkins;G I H Kerley,Grassland albedo as a nature-based climate prospect: the role of growth form and grazing,"Nature-based solutions for mitigating climate change focus largely on land management to reduce carbon emissions and enhance carbon sequestration. Tree planting, commonly advocated for carbon offset, threatens grassland biodiversity and may induce positive radiative forcing (warming) by lowering albedo. Before making decisions about land-use changes in grasslands, an understanding of the fine-scale albedo of grassy versus woody vegetation is needed. Existing satellite-based albedo products offer global coverage with temporally fine, but spatially coarse, resolution, whereas fine-scale in situ grassland albedo data are sparse. We examined the hypotheses that albedo varies seasonally between grass type patches, between shrub and grass patches, and with grazing at the patch scale. Using a tripod-mounted albedometer, we quantified albedo of seven distinct grassland patches in South Africa’s eastern Karoo during early and late dormancy and growing seasons. Patches included intensely-grazed grazing lawn (Cynodon dactylon), grazed and less-grazed red tussock grass (Themeda triandra), grazed and less-grazed white tussock grass (Eragrostis lehmanniana), shrub (Pentzia incana) encroached grass, and bare ground. Season influenced albedo in all patches and, additionally, we found strong differences for the same period between years due to varying rainfall and temperature patterns. For grass-dominated patches, albedo differences were most pronounced during early dormancy, likely due to an effect of grass inflorescences. Albedo of intensely-grazed grazing lawns was consistently higher than other patches, except during early dormancy when white tussock grass albedo was equally high. We found no albedo difference between grazed and less-grazed tussock patches of either red or white grass. Shrub-encroached patches exhibited consistently lower albedo than other patches. Our findings underscore the nuanced relationship between grassland patches and albedo, with shrub encroachment, proposed afforestation, and certain grasses possibly increasing warming potential through reduced albedo. As climate initiatives extend into grasslands, understanding these patterns is essential for climate change mitigation and grassland conservation."
10.5194/acp-24-11981-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文探讨了气溶胶科学的进步如何帮助我们更好地理解室外颗粒物污染对健康的影响。文章指出，尽管PM2.5的总质量浓度与健康影响之间存在关联，但目前缺乏关于PM化学成分的大规模高分辨率数据，这阻碍了更精准的健康风险评估。作者主张将PM的化学成分纳入流行病学健康评估，制定更有针对性的污染物减排策略。为了实现这一目标，文章强调需要全球范围、长期、高分辨率的PM化学成分数据，这需要结合实地观测和模型输出。此外，文章还讨论了用于估算个体PM成分暴露量的模型工具、环境观测需求、排放及其大气转化过程中的关键差距，以及加强气溶胶科学家和流行病学家之间跨学科合作的重要性。总而言之，文章认为气溶胶科学已发展到一个关键时刻，可以阐明不同PM成分对健康的不同影响，为将PM化学成分纳入空气质量指导方针奠定基础。这与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关，因为这些技术能够提供所需的大规模、高分辨率的PM化学成分数据。,"['Particulate matter (PM) chemical composition', 'Aerosol science', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Epidemiological studies', 'Emission sources', 'Health impacts']",Imad El Haddad;Danielle Vienneau;Kaspar R. Daellenbach;Robin Modini;Jay G. Slowik;Abhishek Upadhyay;Petros N. Vasilakos;David Bell;Kees de Hoogh;Andre S. H. Prevot,Opinion: How will advances in aerosol science inform our understanding of the health impacts of outdoor particulate pollution?,"This opinion paper explores how advances in aerosol science inform our understanding of the health impacts of outdoor particulate pollution. We advocate for a shift in the way we target PM pollution, focusing on the most harmful anthropogenic emissions. We highlight key observations, modelling developments, and emission measurements needed to achieve this shift. 
 Air pollution, characterized by high levels of particulate matter (PM), poses the greatest environmental threat to human health, causing an estimated 7 million deaths annually and accounting for 5 % of the global gross domestic product (GDP). While the health impacts of PM are influenced by the toxicity of its individual chemical constituents, the mortality burden of PM is solely based on its total mass concentration. This is because of a lack of large-scale, high-resolution data on PM chemical composition, needed for epidemiological assessments. Identifying which PM constituents are harmful to health has been the “holy grail” of atmospheric science since the landmark 1993 study on six US cities established a definitive link between PM and mortality. Ever since, atmospheric scientists have focused on understanding aerosol composition, emission sources, and formation pathways, while longitudinal epidemiological studies have required individual-level exposure data, employing land use regression models for the prediction of exposures at fine resolutions. In this opinion article, we argue that the time has come to shift the focus towards incorporating PM chemical composition into epidemiological health assessments, laying the foundation for the development of new regulatory metrics. This shift will enable the creation of targeted guidelines and subsequent regulations, prioritizing mitigation efforts against the most harmful anthropogenic emissions. Central to this shift is the availability of global, long-term, high-resolution data on PM chemical composition that are obtained through field observations and modelling outputs. In the article, we underscore key milestones within aerosol science that have been integral for advancing this foundational shift. Specifically, we examine emerging modelling tools for estimating exposure to individual PM components, present the type of ambient observations needed for model developments, identify key gaps in our fundamental understanding of emissions and their atmospheric transformation, and propose advancing cross-disciplinary collaboration between aerosol scientists and epidemiologists to understand the health impacts of individual PM components. We contend that aerosol science has now reached a pivotal moment in elucidating the differential health impacts of PM components, representing a first step towards their incorporation into air quality guidelines."
10.5194/acp-24-12031-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了近年来发生在撒哈拉沙漠地区极端沙尘暴事件，这些事件导致大量沙尘向北蔓延至大西洋和欧洲，引发了创纪录的PM10和PM2.5污染事件。文章分析了导致这些事件的气象条件，指出异常的亚热带反气旋和低压系统是关键因素。研究使用了西班牙和葡萄牙341个地面空气质量监测站的数据，并提出了一种新的数据重建方法“duxt-r”，用于处理极端沙尘事件中PM10监测数据不足的问题。结果显示，在极端沙尘事件期间，PM10和PM2.5浓度达到了前所未有的高水平。文章还指出，这些事件发生在一个沙尘排放量持续减少的背景下，这需要进一步研究。虽然文章主要基于地面观测数据，但其研究主题与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如，卫星观测可以用来监测沙尘暴的发生、发展和输送过程，而大气成分分析技术则可以用来研究沙尘暴对大气化学成分的影响。因此，该研究可以为改进大气环境遥感技术和应用提供参考。,"['PM10', 'PM2.5', 'Saharan dust', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'satellite observation', 'air pollution']",Sergio Rodríguez;Jessica López-Darias,"Extreme Saharan dust events expand northward over the Atlantic and Europe, prompting record-breaking PM10 and PM2.5 episodes","Extreme Saharan dust events expanded northward to the Atlantic and Europe, prompting record-breaking PM10 and PM2.5 events. These episodes are caused by low-to-high dipole meteorology during hemispheric anomalies characterized by subtropical anticyclones shifting to higher latitudes, anomalous low pressures beyond the tropics and amplified Rossby waves. Extreme dust events occur in a paradoxical context of a multidecadal decrease in dust emissions, a topic that requires further investigation. 
 Unprecedented extreme Saharan dust (duxt) events have recently expanded northward from subtropical NW Africa to the Atlantic and Europe, with severe impacts on the Canary Islands, mainland Spain and continental Portugal. These six historic duxt episodes occurred on 3–5 and 22–29 February 2020, 15–21 February 2021, 14–17 January 2022, 29 January–1 February 2022, and 14–20 March 2022. We analyzed data of 341 governmental air quality monitoring stations (AQMSs) in Spain (330) and Portugal (11), where PM10 and PM2.5 are measured with European norm (EN) standards, and found that during duxt events PM10 concentrations are underestimated due to technical limitations of some PM10 monitors meaning that they can not properly measure extremely high concentrations. We assessed the consistency of PM10 and PM2.5 data and reconstructed 1690 PM10 (1 h average) data points of 48 and 7 AQMSs in Spain and Portugal, respectively, by using our novel “duxt-r” method. During duxt events, 1 h average PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were within the range 1000–6000 µg m−3 and 400–1200 µg m−3, respectively. The intense winds leading to massive dust plumes occurred within meteorological dipoles formed by a blocking anticyclone over western Europe and a cutoff low located to the southwest, near the Canary Islands and Cape Verde, or into the Sahara. These cyclones reached this region via two main paths: by deviating southward from the Atlantic mid-latitude westerly circulation or northward from the tropical belt. The analysis of the 2000–2022 PM10 and PM2.5 time series shows that these events have no precedent in this region. The 22–29 February 2020 event led to (24 h average) PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations within the range 600–1840 and 200–404 µg m−3, respectively, being the most intense dust episode ever recorded on the Canary Islands. The 14–20 March 2022 event led to (24 h average) PM10 and PM2.5 values within the range 500–3070 and 100–690 µg m−3 in southeastern Spain, 200–1000 and 60–260 µg m−3 in central Spain, 150–500 and 75–130 µg m−3 in the northern regions of mainland Spain, and within the ranges 200–650 and 30–70 µg m−3 in continental Portugal, respectively, being the most intense dust episode ever recorded in these regions. All duxt events occurred during meteorological anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere characterized by subtropical anticyclones shifting to higher latitudes, anomalous low pressure  expanding beyond the tropical belt and amplified mid-latitude Rossby waves. New studies have reported on recent record-breaking PM10 and PM2.5 episodes linked to dipole-induced extreme dust events from North Africa and Asia in a paradoxical context of a multidecadal decrease in dust emissions, a topic that requires further investigation."

This novel previously overlooked source of atmospheric HONO and NOx may be an important contribution to the global nitrogen cycle and affects atmospheric oxidizing capacity and climate change. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2) are important atmospheric pollutants and key intermediates in the global nitrogen cycle, but their sources and formation mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of soluble iron (Fe3+) on the photochemical behavior of a widely used neonicotinoid (NN) insecticide, nitenpyram (NPM), in the aqueous phase. The yields of HONO and NOx increased significantly when NPM solution was irradiated in the presence of iron ions (Fe3+). We propose that the enhanced HONO and NO2 emissions from the photodegradation of NPM in the presence of iron ions result from the redox cycle between Fe3+ and Fe2+ and the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) by electron transfer between the excited triplet state of NPM and molecular oxygen (O2). Using the laboratory-derived parameterization based on kinetic data and gridded downward solar radiation, we estimate that the photochemistry of NPM induced by Fe3+ releases 0.50 and 0.77 Tg N yr−1 of NOx and HONO, respectively, into the atmosphere.This study suggests a novel source of HONO and NOx during daytime and potentially helps to narrow the gap between field observations and model outcomes of HONO in the atmosphere. The suggested photochemistry of NPM can be an important contribution to the global nitrogen cycle affecting the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and climate change."

Griesche;Mario Mech;Susanne Crewell;Kerstin Ebell,Combining low- and high-frequency microwave radiometer measurements from the MOSAiC expedition for enhanced water vapour products,"We developed retrievals of integrated water vapour (IWV), temperature profiles, and humidity profiles from ground-based passive microwave remote sensing measurements gathered during the MOSAiC expedition. We demonstrate and quantify the benefit of combining low- and high-frequency microwave radiometers to improve humidity profiling and IWV estimates by comparing the retrieved quantities to single-instrument retrievals and reference datasets (radiosondes). 
 In the central Arctic, high-quality water vapour observations are sparse due to the low density of meteorological stations and uncertainties in satellite remote sensing. Different reanalyses also disagree on the amount of water vapour in the central Arctic. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of the Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition provides comprehensive observations that are suitable for evaluating satellite products and reanalyses. Radiosonde observations provide high-quality water vapour estimates with a high vertical but a low temporal resolution. Observations from the microwave radiometers (MWRs) on board the research vessel Polarstern complement these observations through high temporal resolution. In this study, we demonstrate the high accuracy of the combination of the two MWRs HATPRO (Humidity and Temperature Profiler) and MiRAC-P (Microwave Radiometer for Arctic Clouds – Passive). For this purpose, we developed new retrievals of integrated water vapour (IWV) and profiles of specific humidity and temperature using a neural network approach, including observations from both HATPRO and MiRAC-P to utilize their different water vapour sensitivity. The retrievals were trained with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) and synthetic MWR observations simulated with the Passive and Active Microwave radiative TRAnsfer tool (PAMTRA). We applied the retrievals to synthetic and real observations and evaluated them with ERA5 and radiosondes launched during MOSAiC, respectively. To assess the benefit of the combination of HATPRO and MiRAC-P compared to single MWR retrievals, we compared the errors with respect to MOSAiC radiosondes and computed the vertical information content of the specific humidity profiles. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of IWV was reduced by up to 15 %. Specific humidity biases and RMSE were reduced by up to 75 % and 50 %, respectively. The vertical information content of specific humidity could be increased from 1.7 to 2.4 degrees of freedom. We also computed relative humidity from the retrieved temperature and specific humidity profiles and found that RMSE was reduced from 45 % to 15 %. Finally, we show a case study demonstrating the enhanced humidity profiling capabilities compared to the standard HATPRO-based retrievals. The vertical resolution of the retrieved specific humidity profiles is still low compared to radiosondes, but the case study revealed the potential to resolve major humidity inversions. To what degree the MWR combination detects humidity inversions, also compared to satellites and reanalyses, will be part of future work."

However, the XCO2 retrieved from satellite sensors is spatially discontinuous and has long time intervals. In this study, we generated a spatiotemporal continuous XCO2 dataset based on machine learning models, which has high temporal and spatial resolution. This dataset can be used for in-depth research on carbon sources and sinks. 
 Carbon dioxide (CO2), as a major greenhouse gas, is one of the important causes of global warming. In recent years, the atmospheric CO2 concentration in China has been increasing year by year. Satellite observation is the main means of obtaining atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, the current onboard sensors used for measuring atmospheric CO2 have a narrow observation range and cannot obtain spatiotemporal continuous atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Therefore, this paper proposes a daily full-coverage XCO2 dataset generation method based on the DSC-DF-LGB (Deep Separable Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Forest concatenated with LightGBM) model to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of atmospheric CO2 in China. The DSC-DF-LGB model was established to train the mapping relationship between OCO-2 XCO2 retrieval and related variables (reanalysis XCO2, vegetation parameters, human factors, elevation, and meteorological parameters). The model was used to generate a daily 0.1° full-coverage XCO2 dataset for China from 2015 to 2020. The cross validation (CV) result indicates that the model has strong performance in estimating XCO2, with R2 and RMSE of 0.9633 and 0.9761 ppm. The TCCON independent site validation result indicates that the estimated XCO2 has high consistency with in-situ measurements, with R2 and RMSE of 0.8786 and 1.5452 ppm. The full-coverage and high-resolution XCO2 dataset can provide data support for research on carbon sources and sinks.

A multiscale modeling ensemble chain was assembled as a first step towards an air quality forecasting system. 
 A multiscale modeling ensemble chain has been assembled as a first step towards an air quality analysis and forecasting (AQF) system for Latin America. Two global and three regional models were tested and compared in retrospective mode over a shared domain (120–28° W, 60° S–30° N) for the months of January and July 2015. The objective of this experiment was to understand their performance and characterize their errors. Observations from local air quality monitoring networks in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador and Peru were used for model evaluation. The models generally agreed with observations in large cities such as Mexico City and São Paulo, whereas representing smaller urban areas, such as Bogotá and Santiago, was more challenging. For instance, in Santiago during wintertime, the simulations showed large discrepancies with observations. No single model demonstrated superior performance over others or among pollutants and sites available. In general, ozone and NO2 exhibited the lowest bias and errors, especially in São Paulo and Mexico City. For SO2, the bias and error were close to 200 %, except for Bogotá. The ensemble, created from the median value of all models, was evaluated as well. In some cases, the ensemble outperformed the individual models and mitigated extreme over- or underestimation. However, more research is needed before concluding that the ensemble is the path for an AQF system in Latin America. This study identified certain limitations in the models and global emission inventories, which should be addressed with the involvement and experience of local researchers."

To realize the elimination of VOCs, Ru/CeO2 catalysts have been intensively investigated and applied. Although it has been widely acknowledged that the catalytic performance of platinum group metal catalysts was highly determined by their dispersion and coordination environment, the most reactive structures on Ru/CeO2 catalysts for VOCs oxidation are still ambiguous. In this work, starting from Ce-BTC (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) materials, atomically dispersed Ru catalysts and agglomerated Ru catalysts were successfully created via one-step hydrothermal method (Ru-CeO2-BTC) and conventional incipient wetness impregnation method (Ru/CeO2-BTC), respectively. In a typical model reaction of C3H6 oxidation, atomically dispersed Ruδ+ species with the formation of abundant Ru–O–Ce linkages on Ru-CeO2-BTC were found to perform much better than agglomerated RuOx species on Ru/CeO2-BTC. Further characterizations and mechanism study disclosed that Ru-CeO2-BTC catalyst with atomically dispersed Ru ions and more superior low temperature redox performance compared to Ru/CeO2-BTC could better facilitate the adsorption/activation of C3H6 and the decomposition/desorption of intermediates, thus exhibiting superior C3H6 oxidation activity. This work elucidated the reactive sites on Ru/CeO2 catalysts in the C3H6 oxidation reaction and provided insightful guidance for designing efficient Ru/CeO2 catalysts to eliminate VOCs."
10.1029/2024GL111911,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了大气CO2增长率和气候变化对海洋碳汇的影响。它使用ECCO-Darwin海洋生物地球化学模型进行了一系列数值实验，以区分自然变率和外部强迫引起的变化。研究发现，在全球尺度上，大气CO2增长率和气候变化对海洋碳吸收的影响幅度相似；但在局部尺度上，海气CO2通量的年际变化主要受气候影响。该研究强调，为了检测未来大气CO2增长率下降对海洋碳汇的影响，需要改进海洋观测系统，并更好地约束气候驱动的海洋变率。 这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为研究依赖于对大气CO2浓度和海洋碳汇的观测，而这些观测可以由卫星遥感等技术提供。,"['Atmospheric CO2', 'Air-sea CO2 flux', 'Ocean carbon sink', 'Climate variability', 'Satellite observations of ocean CO2', 'Numerical modeling']",Amanda R.

Here we use a suite of numerical experiments based on the ECCO‐Darwin ocean biogeochemistry model to separate the impact of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) growth rate and climate on the ocean carbon sink — with a goal of disentangling the space‐time variability of the dominant drivers. When globally integrated, the variable atmospheric growth rate and climate exhibit similar magnitude impacts on ocean carbon uptake. At local scales, interannual variability in air‐sea CO2 flux is dominated by climate. The implications of our study for real‐world ocean observing systems are clear: in order to detect future changes in the ocean sink due to slowing atmospheric CO2 growth rates, better observing systems and constraints on climate‐driven ocean variability are required."
10.1029/2024EF004430,True,Earth's Future,这篇论文研究了1901年到2020年全球热浪的频率、强度及其驱动因素。研究发现，热浪的频率和强度都急剧增加，其空间分布不均，强度波动性增强，并且由于干旱加剧，四个关键热浪指标的基尼系数增大。虽然干旱地区热浪发生频率更高，但潮湿地区的累积热量更大，导致这些地区的热浪风险更高。过去三十年（1991-2020年）的全球热浪风险比20世纪初（1901-1930年）增加了近五倍。GeoDetector分析表明，在干旱和潮湿地区，帕尔默干旱严重性指数（PDSI）和向下地表短波辐射（Srad）的贡献最大。相对湿度（RH）、风速（WS）、土壤湿度（SM）和归一化植被指数（NDVI）在潮湿地区的贡献也很显著，但在干旱地区则小得多。复合分析表明，热浪风险异常高的年份对应于500百帕位势高度和地表气压的正异常。下沉气流抑制云的形成，导致大气温度升高，这可能增加了热浪发生的风险。该研究强调了迫切需要解决气候变化日益恶化的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星观测数据（例如地表温度、辐射、植被指数等）来分析热浪，并利用这些数据研究气候变化的影响。,"['Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Surface shortwave radiation', 'Geopotential height', 'Surface pressure', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Climate change', 'Heatwave risk assessment', 'Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)', 'Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)', 'Air temperature', 'Soil moisture']",Chuan Wang;Zhi Li;Yaning Chen;Yupeng Li;Lin Ouyang;Jianyu Zhu;Fan Sun;Shiran Song;Hongwei Li,Changes in Global Heatwave Risk and Its Drivers Over One Century,"
Heatwaves represent a significant and growing threat to natural ecosystems and socio‐economic structures, making heatwave risk mitigation and prevention an important area of research. In exploring heatwave frequency and intensity from 1901 to 2020, the present study finds a sharp increase in both. The study also finds that the spatial distribution of heatwaves is unequal, the volatility of intensity characteristics has become more prominent over time, and the Gini coefficients of four key heatwave indictors have become larger due to increasing dryness. Although heatwaves occur more frequently in drylands, there is greater cumulative heat in humid areas, resulting in a higher heatwave risk in those areas. The global heatwave risk over the past three decades (1991–2020) has increased nearly five‐fold compared to the early 20th century (1901–1930). Furthermore, GeoDetector analysis indicates that the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and downward surface shortwave radiation (Srad) contributing the most in drylands and humid areas (0.29 and 0.41, respectively). The contribution of relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), soil moisture (SM), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is also significant in humid areas, but is much smaller in drylands. Composite analysis shows that the years with anomalously high heatwave risk correspond to positive anomalies of 500hPa geopotential height and surface pressure. The inhibition of cloud formation due to sinking air and the resulting increase in temperature in the atmosphere may be increasing the risk of heatwave occurrence. This study emphasizes the urgent need to address worsening climate change impacts."
10.1029/2024EF004973,True,Earth's Future,这篇论文研究了历史时期和未来气候情景下，蒸散发(ET)的变化趋势及其驱动因素。研究者使用简单的线性模型，分析了不同大气变量（例如净辐射、水汽）对ET的影响，发现气溶胶和温室气体在不同地区对历史时期ET趋势的影响不同，尤其在人口稠密地区，气溶胶的影响更为显著。该研究使用了全球气候模式(GCM)数据，这与卫星遥感观测和大气成分分析密切相关，因为GCMs需要依赖于这些数据来模拟大气过程和气候变化。虽然文中没有明确提到具体的卫星传感器或空气质量监测技术，但其研究结果对改进气候模型，提高对未来水资源和生态系统变化的预测能力具有重要意义，这与大气环境遥感技术的发展和应用息息相关。,"['Aerosol', 'Greenhouse gases', 'Evapotranspiration', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Climate modeling', 'Surface radiation', 'Water availability', 'Air quality']",Marius Egli;Vincent Humphrey;Sebastian Sippel;Reto Knutti,A Distinct Role for Aerosol and GHG Forcing in Historical CMIP6 Evapotranspiration Trends,"Evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for the global water balance, plant growth, and freshwater availability. It connects the surface water balance with surface energy fluxes, making its accurate representation vital for climate projections. However, global climate models (GCMs) struggle with ET representation due to resolution limitations and simplified depictions of soil, plant, and atmosphere interactions. Simulated future changes in ET are uncertain, and the role of driving processes remain unclear. Here, we explore the utility of a simple and interpretable method to disentangle these varying drivers. We investigate the sensitivity of JJA ET to different atmospheric variables through simple linear models predicting ET from atmospheric variables only. The model consistently yields good results across GCMs or forcing scenarios. We find that GCMs have shown strong decreases and subsequent increases in ET over the historical period, related to changes in net surface radiation. For future climate projections, decreases in water availability compete with higher available surface radiation, making future projections uncertain. Single forcing GCM realizations show that historical ET trends in densely populated regions have been more influenced by aerosol emissions than greenhouse gases. Finally, we investigate which atmospheric variables explain most short‐term (year‐to‐year) and long‐term (decadal) changes. While water availability may be the most important driver of short‐term variability, for certain regions, radiation trends dominate long‐term forcing. This paper leverages a simple approach to provide a comprehensive and understandable view into recent and future changes in ET, reconciling the evidence provided by more complex case studies."

 The vertical variations and key drivers of ozone and its precursors, namely NOx and VOCs, in the atmospheric boundary layer, have vital impacts on surface ozone budgets but are poorly understood so far. Using online gradient measurements from a 356 m tower, we obtained continuous vertical profiles of ozone and its precursors, which exhibited strong gradients throughout the day. In the daytime, the vertical gradients of ozone precursors are significantly regulated by reactions with OH radicals. At night, our observations confirmed more intense VOC reactions with NO3 radicals in the residual layer than in the boundary layer. Additionally, we found that residual layer entrainment could contribute to over half of the boundary-layer ozone enhancements in the morning periods. Our results underscore the importance of considering vertical changes of ozone and its precursors in the atmospheric boundary layer when developing future ozone mitigation strategies."

 The process of crop type mapping generates land use maps, which serve as critical tools for efficient evaluation of production factors and impacts of agricultural practice. Yet, despite the necessity for comprehensive solutions in space and time, the state of research still exhibits significant limitations in these two dimensions: (1) From a temporal perspective, the primary focus of past research in crop type mapping has been on the economically most meaningful, main-season crops, thereby largely neglecting the explicit study of off-season vegetation despite its pivotal roles in year-round management cycles. (2) Viewed spatially, study areas in crop type mapping show distinct limitations from a multi- and transnational standpoint, despite intense cross-regional and international interrelations of agricultural production and an increasing number of countries publishing crop reference data. With a focus on Europe, this research aims to tackle the two described shortcomings (a) by investigating to what extent a selection of major off-season, winter vegetation types in continental Europe can be classified and (b) by analyzing the transnational applicability of the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) for remote sensing-based crop type mapping across the European Union (EU). This study uses ESA’s Sentinel-2 satellite data, EU’s administrative farming declarations, and HCAT labels to analyze off-season farming measures, based on a study period from late summer to spring, in Austria, France, Germany, and Slovenia. We demonstrate that deep learning models effectively identify major productive and agroecogically significant winter vegetation in continental Europe. HCAT proves thereby valuable for transnational crop classification, excelling in mixed-country experiments and showing potential for transfer learning. This study’s findings provide a solid foundation for advancing transnational as well as winter and all-year crop type mapping, thereby serving as contribution towards temporally and spatially holistic research on agricultural practices’ sociocultural, economic, and environmental impacts."

 PM2.5 can cause lung cell injury. Due to the complexity and variation of the physical and chemical properties of PM2.5, the risk of lung cell injury may depend significantly on the type of atmospheric environment. With a population of 120 million, the Chengdu-Chongqing region in China is the most populated region in the world that experiences both high humidity and low solar radiation (HHLR). However, PM2.5-related lung cell injury and treatment strategies in this type of environment are still unclear. Thus, our study focuses on the relationships between the chemical components, lung cell injury effects, and pathogenic mechanisms of PM2.5 in HHLR (HHLR-PM2.5). In terms of mass, organic carbon (OC), NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+ are found to be the most significant components of HHLR-PM2.5. Extracts of HHLR-PM2.5 significantly inhibit cell viability, stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and trigger inflammation. Utilizing a combination of multi-omics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology, it is found that HHLR-PM2.5 extracts inhibit E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (UHRF1) to suppress DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and hamper DNA methylation, culminating in lung cell injury. Additionally, integrating transcriptomic data with human disease databases highlights chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a potential lung cell injury-related respiratory affliction induced by HHLR-PM2.5. This study expands the scientific comprehension of the health risks associated with HHLR-PM2.5, deciphers the molecular mechanism of lung cell injury, and provides precise treatment strategies for HHLR-PM2.5-induced lung cell injury."

 Particulate matters accepted as air quality markers are also indicators of the health risk of the population, especially children, because of their increased susceptibility to the quality of the air they breathe. Understanding the correlations between the concentration of particulate matter in the outdoor air and meteorological conditions will help to take steps to reduce pollution and reduce the risk of threats to health and life. For many years, scientists from all over the world have been looking for relationship between the impact of meteorological conditions on the concentration of particulate matter. Despite this, it is still not known whether the relationships will be similar in all locations. Furthermore, there is no agreement among scientists on the direction and strength of the correlation between temperature, humidity, and particulate matter concentrations. The article presents an attempt to link the impact of meteorological conditions on particulate matter concentrations depending on the classification of the area into air quality index in the particulate matter (AQIPM) category. Three locations with a specific air quality index were included: extremely poor, moderate & fair and good. The research was carried out at nine locations near educational facilities. Four measurement series were carried out for each location. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship with an assumed significance level of 0.05. A research hypothesis was adopted: The correlation between particulate matter and meteorological conditions is different in locations with different AQIPM. The results obtained clearly show that the relationships between meteorological conditions and the concentration of particulate matter depend on the classification of the area into a specific category of the air quality index. The strongest correlation occurs in the fair & moderate AQIPM area. In relation to temperature, there is a negative correlation, and in relation to humidity, positive. In the extremely poor AQIPM area, no relationship was observed between humidity and particulate matter concentration. In the good AQIPM area, the correlation in relation to temperature was very weak, in relation to humidity, weak."

 Snowfall is a critical component of the Earth system and an important indicator and amplifier of climate change. Climate warming is reducing the seasonal snowpack globally, which could have catastrophic consequences for the regions in high dependence on snow for water recharge. However, the climate influences on extreme snowfall events, which significantly impact humans, are still poorly understood. This study uses the Tibetan Plateau snowpack observation dataset combined with NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6) climate data to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of snowfall, and to explore its response mechanism to climate change and future change trends across the Lower Yarlung Zangbo River (LYZR) in Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP). Annual snowfall decreased at a rate of 1.05 mm per decade (P < 0.05) during the historical period (1960–2014). Relative to 1960–2014, annual snowfall would decline of ∼38 % and ∼ 73 % by the end of the 21st century under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. At the same time, a general decrease in extreme snowfall averaged the LYZR is expected for historical and future periods, but it showed notable spatial variations. The regional increase in extreme snowfall is mainly distributed along the valley of Brahmaputra-Yarlung Zangbo. In addition, precipitation accounted for 66.5 % of the snowfall variations during the historical period. Meanwhile, according to future warming, temperature would dominate snowfall variations, contributing 56.66 % to 72.92 % during 2015–2100. The projected response of mean and extreme snowfall to climate change indicates that it is a double-edged sword. To scientifically address the risks and challenges posed by snowfall changes in alpine regions, it is imperative to limit future climate warming."

10.5194/amt-17-6247-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这项研究探讨了利用遥感技术改善景观火灾烟雾排放量和成分估算的可行性。研究人员测试了两种通过实验室火灾确定燃烧阶段的方法，并将其与排放的烟雾进行了比较。其中一种方法——检测钾发射线（K线）——与火辐射功率（FRP）数据结合，显著提高了对烟雾排放量的估算精度，特别是二氧化碳（CO2）的排放量提高了17%-42%。该方法还改善了对一氧化碳（CO）、甲烷（CH4）和改进燃烧效率（MCE）的估算。MCE与许多烟雾成分的排放因子相关，因此远程获取MCE可以改进烟雾排放计算。研究人员还利用机载遥感数据验证了该方法在实际野火中的有效性。研究结果表明，结合使用K线和FRP数据的卫星遥感方法可以显著改进景观火灾燃烧阶段、燃料消耗以及烟雾排放量和成分的测绘，这对于大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析具有重要意义。,"['smoke emission', 'fire combustion phase', 'atmospheric composition', 'satellite remote sensing', 'air quality monitoring', 'CO2', 'CO', 'CH4', 'Potassium emission line', 'Fire radiative power', 'Modified combustion efficiency', 'Airborne EO data']",Farrer Owsley-Brown;Martin J. Wooster;Mark J. Grosvenor;Yanan Liu,Can the remote sensing of combustion phase improve estimates of landscape fire smoke emission rate and composition?,"Landscape fires produce vast amounts of smoke, affecting the atmosphere locally and globally. Whether a fire is flaming or smouldering strongly impacts the rate at which smoke is produced as well as its composition. This study tested two methods to determine these combustion phases in laboratory fires and compared them to the smoke emitted. One of these methods improved estimates of smoke emission significantly. This suggests potential for improvement in global emission estimates. 
 The proportion of flaming and smouldering (or smoldering) activity occurring in landscape fires varies with fuel type and fuel characteristics, which themselves are influenced by ecology, meteorology, time since the last fire, etc. The proportion of these combustion phases greatly influences the rate of fuel consumption and smoke emission, along with the chemical composition of the smoke, which influences the effects on the atmosphere. Earth observation (EO) has long been suggested as a way to remotely map combustion phase, and here we provide the first known attempt at evaluating whether such approaches can lead to the desired improvements in smoke emissions estimation. We use intensively measured laboratory burns to evaluate two EO approaches hypothesized to enable remote determination of combustion phase and concurrent measurements of the smoke to determine how well each is able to improve estimation of smoke emission rates, smoke composition, and the overall rate of fuel consumption. The first approach aims to estimate the sub-pixel “effective fire temperature”, which has been suggested to differ between flaming and smouldering combustion, and the second detects the potassium emission line (K-line) believed only to be present during flaming combustion. We find while the fire effective temperature approach can be suited to estimating fire radiative power (FRP), it does not significantly improve on current approaches to estimate smoke chemical makeup and smoke emission. The K-line approach does however provide these improvements when combined with the FRP data, improving the accuracy of the estimated CO2 emission rate by an average of 17±4 % and 42±15 %, respectively, depending on whether the K-line detection is used to simply classify the presence of flaming combustion or whether its magnitude is also used to estimate its relative proportion. Estimates of CO and CH4 emission rates were improved to a lesser extent than that of CO2, but the accuracy of the smoke modified combustion efficiency (MCE) estimates increased by 30±15 % and 46±10 %, respectively. MCE is correlated to the emissions factors (EFs) of many smoke constituents, so remotely deriving MCE provides a way to tailor these during smoke emissions calculations. Whilst we derived and tested our approaches on laboratory burns, we demonstrate their wider efficacy using airborne EO data of a boreal forest wildfire where we find that combined use of K-line and FRP data significantly changed estimated smoke MCE and CO2 and CO emission rates compared to the standard approach. Our findings suggest that satellite EO methods that jointly provide K-line and FRP data could enable marked improvements in the mapping of landscape fire combustion phase, fuel consumption, and smoke emissions rate and composition."

Part I: Nighttime 532 nm Polarization and High-Spectral-Resolution Channel,"This paper presents a comprehensive calibration procedure for the first spaceborne high-spectral-resolution lidar with an iodine vapor absorption filter ACDL on board DQ-1 by utilizing nighttime 532 nm multi-channel data. And analyzed the error sources of the multi-channel calibration coefficients and assessed the results. The results shows that the ACDL polarization and HSRL channel calibration is reliable and operates within the expected error range of approximately 5 %. 
 The Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (DQ-1) was successfully launched in April 2022, with the capability of providing continuous multi-sensor spatial and optical simultaneous observations of carbon dioxide, aerosols and clouds. The primary payload carried on DQ-1 is an Aerosol and Carbon dioxide Detection Lidar (ACDL). The instrument comprises a high-spectral-resolution channel at 532 nm, polarization channels at 532 nm, elastic scattering channel at 1064 nm, and integrated-path differential absorption (IPDA) channel at 1572 nm. The optical properties of aerosols and clouds measured by the ACDL promote a quantitative characterization of the uncertainties in the global climate system, hence the precise calibrations for the ACDL are necessary. This paper outlines the algorithms employed for calibrating the nighttime 532 nm measurements for the first spaceborne high-spectral-resolution lidar with an iodine vapor absorption filter. The nighttime calibrations of the 532 nm data are fundamental to the ACDL measurement procedure, as they are utilized to derive the calibrations over daytime orbits and the calibrations of the 1064 nm channel relative to the 532 nm channel. This paper provides a review of the theoretical foundations for molecular normalization techniques as applied to spaceborne lidar measurements, includes a detailed discussion of auxiliary data and theoretical parameters used in ACDL calibrations, as well as a comprehensive description of the calibration algorithm procedure. To mitigate large errors stemming from high-energy events during calibration, a data filter is designed to obtain valid calibration signals. The paper also assesses the results of the calibration procedure, by analyzing the errors of calibration coefficients and validating the attenuated backscatter coefficient results. The results indicate that the relative error of the calibrated attenuated backscatter coefficients is lower than 1 % in the calibration area, and the uncertainty of the clear-air scattering ratio was within anticipated range of 6 %."

Both satellites provide high precision and accuracy, making them suitable for emission flux estimates. Simulations using a Lagrangian dispersion model showed that background mixing ratio variations play a larger role than local source changes. 
 The OCO-2 and GOSAT series of satellites provide near-global coverage of CO2 and CH4 mixing ratios. To accurately derive emission fluxes from the observed mixing ratios, it is crucial that these data meet specific precision and systematic error requirements. In this study, we report validation results for GOSAT and OCO-2 over South Asia, obtained using a portable Fourier Transform infrared Spectrometer (FTS) at a tropical rural site (Gadanki; Latitude: 13.45° N, Longitude: 79.18° E) in Southern India, from November 2015 to July 2016. Biases in CH4 mixing ratios from GOSAT ranged from -9 to -18.5 ppb, depending on the collocation criteria, while CO2 data from OCO-2 demonstrated better accuracy and precision, meeting the requirements of ESA’s Climate Change Initiative (CCI). Using the FLEXPART model, we also show that CH4 emissions from regional sources accounted for only 35 % of the day-to-day observed variability. Both model-derived and observed mixing ratios exhibited the same seasonal variation, with higher values in October–November and lower values in June–July. However, the observed mixing ratios decreased by approximately 100 ppb, while the model-derived values decreased by only 20 ppb, suggesting that atmospheric chemistry and variations in background concentrations play a significant role over South India."

 The initial release of near-real-time (NRT) atmospheric and oceanic science products from Japanese Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 (H8/9) geostationary (GEO) satellites over the South China Sea (SCS) was unveiled in 2024. The primary objective behind crafting these NRT H8/9 satellite products is to facilitate weather and marine environment monitoring, enhance maritime security, and aid ocean navigation, among other purposes. As part of this investigation, a novel NRT data processing system was devised to generate a variety of regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products within a resolution of 10 min and a gridded resolution of 0.05° × 0.05° from 3 November 2022 to the present. This algorithm system was built upon the preceding Fengyun (FY) geostationary satellite algorithm test bed (FYGAT), which was the prototype of the FY-4 GEO meteorological satellite science product operational processing system. These regional H8/9 GEO satellite science products encompass a range of crucial data such as cloud mask, fraction, height, phase, optical, and microphysical properties; layered precipitable water; and sea surface temperature. We subjected these products to rigorous evaluations against high-quality analogous satellite products and reanalysis data spanning 1 year in 2023. The validations underscore a strong consistency between the H8/9 GEO satellite atmospheric and oceanic science products over the SCS and the referenced products. Nevertheless, slight discrepancies in these satellite science products were identified, primarily stemming from variations in sensor/dataset characteristics, retrieval algorithms, and geometric conditions. These outcomes demonstrate the suitability of the first edition of NRT atmospheric and oceanic science products of H8/9 satellites over the SCS in supporting the intended quantitative applications.

 The frequency and severity of fire weather have increased under climate change, particularly in high-latitude boreal forests. Lightning, a key ignition source globally, is also expected to become more frequent with climate change and could significantly increase burn area. Current research on lightning-ignited wildfires (LIW) has a long history in boreal ecosystems but has typically focused on North America due to better data availability, while the lack of publicly available data for Eurasia has hindered our comprehensive understanding of important characteristics of LIW, such as holdover time, lightning-ignition efficiency, frequency, and spatial distribution of lightning-ignited wildfires in boreal forests. This study introduces the Temporal Minimum Distance (TMin) method, a novel approach to matching lightning strikes with wildfires without requiring ignition location, that outperformed current methodologies. As a result, we developed a comprehensive dataset of lightning-ignited wildfires across the entire boreal forest from 2012 to 2022, encompassing 6,228 fires — 4,186 in Eurasia and 2,042 in North America — each over 200 hectares in size.

Using long‐term GEOS‐Chem simulations, we found distinct changes in planetary boundary layer ozone throughout China during positive and negative phases of IOD. In summer, ozone shows synchronized increases except in southern China during positive IOD; the ozone increases are dominated by chemical production and transport in northern and western China, respectively. The increased precursor from biogenic emissions contributed to ozone chemical formation in the northern region, and the increased precipitation and decreased solar radiation hindered ozone production in southern China. Ozone changes show good symmetry over most regions during negative IOD.

 The Southeastern Siberia (SES) region has recently experienced increasingly extensive wildfires in spring, which have threatened its large carbon sequestration capacity from vast forests and peatlands. However, the underlying mechanisms propelling the increased fires and their potential responses to future climate change remain unclear. Here, by using reanalysis data and climate model output together with a deep learning model, we explore the relationship between positive-phase North Atlantic Tripole (NAT) sea-surface temperature anomalies and SES wildfire increases and project the future trend in SES wildfire intensities under climate change. We found that the positive-phase April NAT enhances the Siberian anticyclone, causing increased temperatures and snowmelt via strengthened transport of warm-air advection into the SES region. The latter process heightens the exposure of local high-density peatlands to favorable conditions for fire ignition and leads to more intensive wildfire incidents. We further demonstrate that the projected NAT variations can drive interdecadal changes in future April SES wildfires. With future phase shifting of NAT modes under global warming, the regionally averaged burned area in SES could be increased by 47–62% under different warming scenarios from 1982–2014 to 2015–2100. Our findings reveal the climate-driven escalation of future wildfires in SES in the context of global warming and call for active and urgent fire management strategies to mitigate the fire risk."

 Observed North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures are modulated by a recurrent alternation of anomalously warm and cold interdecadal phases known as Atlantic Multidecadal Variability. Here we use observations and a multi-model ensemble of climate simulations to demonstrate an ongoing acceleration of North Atlantic surface warming, which implies a smaller contribution of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability to 21st century North Atlantic sea-surface temperature anomalies than previously thought. Future projections of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability from realistic climate simulations are poorly constrained, yet a relaxation to a neutral phase by the mid-21st century emerges as the most probable evolution of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability. In the simulations, the mitigating effects of a less likely upcoming cold phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability are overwhelmed by fast North Atlantic surface warming, which is robustly projected to persist in upcoming decades independent of emission scenarios. Sustained North Atlantic surface warming is therefore expected to continue in the near future. Warming of North Atlantic sea surface temperatures is accelerating, and projected to be stronger than natural variability associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, according to an analysis of climate model simulations."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120873,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了意大利五个大都市地区长期暴露于空气污染与特定死因之间的关联。它是一项多中心纵向研究，使用了来自人口普查和健康登记处的数据，并结合了参与者居住地址的空气污染物浓度数据（PM10、PM2.5、NO2和O3）。研究结果表明，长期暴露于PM10、PM2.5和NO2与非意外死亡率、心血管死亡率和呼吸系统死亡率的风险增加相关，即使在控制了其他污染物后，这种关联仍然存在。该研究使用了地面监测数据，关注的是空气污染物对人体健康的影响，特别是死亡率，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为遥感技术可以提供大范围、长时间序列的空气污染物浓度数据，为这类流行病学研究提供重要的数据支持。,"['Air quality monitoring', 'Particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5)', 'Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)', 'Ground-based monitoring', 'Mortality risk assessment', 'Epidemiological study']",Federica Nobile;Nicola Caranci;Elena Strippoli;Valentina Adorno;Alessandra Allotta;Lucia Bisceglia;Ida Galise;Claudio Gariazzo;Sara Maio;Paola Michelozzi;Walter Pollina Addario;Andrea Ranzi;Claudio Rubino;Maria Serinelli;Giovanni Viegi;Nicolás Zengarini;Petter Ljungman;Massimo Stafoggia;Sandra Baldacci;Sara Maio,Association between long-term exposure to air pollution and cause-specific mortality within five Italian longitudinal metropolitan studies,"•First Italian multicenter longitudinal metropolitan study on air pollution and mortality. •Standardized protocols and fine-scale air pollution exposures. •PM and NO2were associated with higher risks of cause-specific mortality outcomes. •Air pollutant adverse effects did not change when adjusted for co-pollutants. •Despite declining air pollution levels, mortality effects remain consistently high. 
 BackgroundExtensive epidemiological literature has documented adverse effects of ambient air pollution on human health. However, in Italy, no multicenter longitudinal studies on chronic exposure to air pollution and mortality have been conducted. Within the BIGEPI project, we aimed to investigate the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and cause-specific mortality in large Italian population-based cohorts.MethodsFive administrative cohorts from Turin, Bologna, Rome, Taranto, and Brindisi (Italy) were included. Subjects aged 30+ were enrolled from the 2011 Census, followed-up until 2018 (2019 for Bologna), and linked with population and health registries. Annual mean concentrations of particulate matter ≤10 and 2.5 μm (PM10 and PM2.5), dioxide nitrogen (NO2), and warm-season ozone (O3w) were assigned to each participant's geocoded residential address at baseline. Long-term associations between pollutants and non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality were investigated through single- and two-pollutant Cox proportional hazard models. Effect modification by sex and age was tested. Cohort-specific estimates were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis.Results2,709,903 subjects (contributing over 18 million person-years) generated 266,821 non-accidental deaths. Each increment of 5 μg/m3 of PM10, 1 μg/m3 of PM2.5 and 10 μg/m3 of NO2 was associated with an increased risk of non-accidental mortality, with pooled Hazard Ratios (HR) of 1.018 (95% CI: 1.005–1.030), 1.004 (95% CI: 1.001–1.007) and 1.010 (95% CI: 1.002–1.018), respectively. HRs for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality were higher, the latter with CIs including the null. The associations remained quite stable after adjustment for the other pollutants. O3w was negatively associated with mortality but estimates were not statistically significant and reduced to unity upon adjustment for NO2. No consistent statistically significant effect modifications by sex and age emerged.ConclusionsUpdated evidence implicates a continued risk of mortality in Italy due to long-term air pollution exposure, despite declining levels of exposure during the last years."

Measurements were made in Helsinki at a street canyon and urban background sites between February 2015 and June 2019. Five different aerosol sources were identified. These sources underline the significance of traffic-related emissions in urban environments despite recent improvements in emission reduction technologies. 
 Particle size is one of the key factors influencing how aerosol particles affect their climate and health effects. Therefore, a better understanding of particle size distributions from various sources is crucial. In urban environments, aerosols are produced in a large number of varying processes and conditions. This study intended to develop the source apportionment of urban aerosols by utilising a novel approach to positive matrix factorisation (PMF). The particle source profiles were detected in particle number size distribution data measured simultaneously in a street canyon and at a nearby urban background station between February 2015 and June 2019 in Helsinki, southern Finland. The novelty of the method is combining the data from both sites and finding profiles for the unified data. Five aerosol sources were found. Four of them were detected at both of the stations: slightly aged traffic (TRA2), secondary combustion aerosol (SCA), secondary aerosol (SecA), and long-range-transported aerosol (LRT). One of the sources, fresh traffic (TRA1) was only detected at a street canyon. The factors were identified based on available auxiliary data. Additionally, the trends of the found factors were studied, and statistically significant decreasing trends were found for TRA1 and SecA. A statistically significant increasing trend was found for TRA2. This work implies that traffic-related aerosols remain important in urban environments and that aerosol sources can be detected using only particle number size distribution data as input in the PMF method."

Rieger;Mattia Righi;Robin N. Thor,The contribution of transport emissions to ozone mixing ratios and methane lifetime in 2015 and 2050 in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs),"We quantified the contributions of land transport, shipping, and aviation emissions to tropospheric ozone; its radiative forcing; and the reductions of the methane lifetime using chemistry-climate model simulations. The contributions were analysed for the conditions of 2015 and for three projections for the year 2050. The results highlight the challenges of mitigating ozone formed by emissions of the transport sector, caused by the non-linearitiy of the ozone chemistry and the long lifetime. 
 We quantify the contributions of emissions from the transport sector to tropospheric ozone and the hydroxyl radical (OH)  by means of model simulations with a global chemistry-climate model equipped with a source attribution method.  For the first time we applied a method which also allows for quantifying contributions to OH which is invariant upon disaggregation or recombination and additive. Based on these quantified contributions, we analyse the ozone radiative forcing (RF) and methane lifetime reductions attributable to emissions from the transport sectors. The contributions were analysed for each transport sector separately and for 2015 as well as for 2050 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0. In line with previous publications using the source attribution approach, we quantify ozone RF attributable to emissions from land transport, shipping, and aviation for the year 2015 of 121, 60, and 31 mW m−2, respectively.  At the same time, we diagnose a relative reduction in methane lifetime due to transport emissions of 14.3 % (land transport), 8.5 % (shipping), and 3.8 % (aviation). These reductions are significantly larger than reported by previous studies due to the application of the source attribution method. Compared to 2015, only SSP1-1.9 shows a strong decrease in ozone RF and methane lifetime reduction attributable to the entire transport sector in 2050. For the projections of SSP2-4.5, we find similar effects of the total transport sector as for 2015, while the effects in SSP3-7.0 increase compared to 2015. This small change in the effects for the two projections compared to 2015 is caused by two main factors. Firstly, aviation emissions are projected to increase in SSP2-4.5  (increase of 107 %) and SSP3-7.0 (+86 %) compared to 2015, resulting in projected ozone RF of 55 mW m−2 (+78 %) and 50 mW m−2 (+61 %)  for the year 2050 from aviation emissions. Secondly, the non-linear effects of atmospheric chemistry in polluted regions such as Europe and North America lead to rather small reductions in ozone and OH in response to emission reductions, especially from land transport emissions. In addition, the increase in emissions from land transport in other parts of the world, particularly in South Asia, leads to an increased contribution of ozone and OH. In particular, ozone formed by land transport emissions from South Asia causes strong RF that partially offsets the reductions in Europe and North America. Moreover, our results show that besides the non-linear response, lack of international cooperation, as in the SSP3-7.0 projection, hinders mitigation of ground-level ozone."

We use aircraft measurements to assess a climate model representation of large-dust transport. We find that the model underestimates the amount of large dust at all stages of transport and that fast removal of the large particles increases this underestimation with distance from the Sahara. 
 Coarse mineral dust particles have been observed much further from the Sahara than expected based on theory. They have impacts different to finer particles on Earth's radiative budget, as well as carbon and hydrological cycles, though they tend to be under-represented in climate models. We use measurements of the full dust size distribution from aircraft campaigns over the Sahara, Canaries, Cabo Verde and Caribbean. We assess the observed and modelled dust size distribution over long-range transport at high vertical resolution using the Met Office Unified Model, which represents dust up to 63.2 µm diameter, greater than most climate models. We show that the model generally replicates the vertical distribution of the total dust mass but transports larger dust particles too low in the atmosphere. Importantly, coarse particles in the model are deposited too quickly, resulting in an underestimation of dust mass that is exacerbated with westwards transport; the 20–63 µm dust mass contribution between 2 and 3.7 km altitude is underestimated by factors of up to 11 in the Sahara, 140 in the Canaries and 240 in Cabo Verde. In the Caribbean, there is negligible modelled contribution of d > 20 µm particles to total mass, compared to 10 % in the observations. This work adds to the growing body of research that demonstrates the need for a process-based evaluation of climate model dust simulations to identify where improvements could be implemented."

In the Arctic, this source of atmospheric particles could play an important role for climate. However, the amount, seasonality and spatial distribution of such emissions are all mostly unknown. Here, we propose a first parameterization for sea spray aerosols emitted through leads in sea ice and quantify their impact on aerosol populations in the high Arctic. 
 Elongated open-water areas in sea ice (leads) release sea spray particles to the atmosphere. However, there is limited knowledge on the amount, properties and drivers of sea spray emitted from leads, and no existing parameterization of this process is available for use in models. In this work, we use measurements of aerosol fluxes from Nilsson et al. (2001) to produce an estimate of the location, timing and amount of sea spray emissions from leads at the scale of the Arctic Ocean for 1 year. Lead fractions are derived using sea ice data sets from numerical models and satellite detection. The proposed parameterization estimates that leads account for 0.3 %–9.8 % of the annual sea salt aerosol number emissions in the Arctic Ocean regions where sea ice concentration is greater than 80 %. Assuming similar size distributions to those from emissions from the open ocean, leads account for 30 %–85 % of mass emissions in sea ice regions. The total annual mass of sea salt emitted from leads, 0.1–2.1 Tg yr−1, is comparable to the mass of sea salt aerosol transported above sea ice from the open ocean, according to the MERRA-2 reanalysis. In addition to providing the first estimates of possible upper and lower bounds of sea spray emissions from leads, the conceptual model developed in this work is implemented and tested in the regional atmospheric chemistry model WRF-Chem. Given the estimates obtained in this work, the impact of sea spray from leads on Arctic clouds and radiative budget needs to be further explored."

Our investigations show the observed diurnal evolution of NO2 at different measurement sites. 
 Instruments for air quality observations on geostationary satellites provide multiple observations per day and allow for the analysis of the diurnal variation in important air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The South Korean instrument GEMS (Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer), launched in February 2020, is the first geostationary instrument that is able to observe the diurnal variation in NO2. The measurements have a spatial resolution of 3.5 km × 8 km and cover a large part of Asia.This study compares 1 year of tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) observations from the operational GEMS L2 product, the scientific GEMS IUP-UB (Institute of Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen) product, the operational TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) product, and ground-based differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements in South Korea. The GEMS L2 tropospheric NO2 VCDs overestimate the ground-based tropospheric NO2 VCDs with a median relative difference of +61 % and a correlation coefficient of 0.76. The median relative difference is −2 % for the GEMS IUP-UB product and −16 % for the TROPOMI product, with correlation coefficients of 0.83 and 0.89, respectively. The scatter in the GEMS products can be reduced when observations are limited to the TROPOMI overpass time.Diurnal variations in tropospheric NO2 VCDs differ by the pollution level of the analyzed site but with good agreement between the GEMS IUP-UB and ground-based observations. Low-pollution sites show weak or almost no diurnal variation. In summer, the polluted sites show a minimum around noon, indicating the large influence of photochemical loss. Most variation is seen in spring and autumn, with increasing NO2 in the morning, a maximum close to noon, and a decrease towards the afternoon. Winter observations show rather flat or slightly decreasing NO2 throughout the day. Winter observations under low-wind-speed conditions at high-pollution sites show enhancements of NO2 throughout the day. This indicates that under calm conditions, dilution and the less effective chemical loss in winter do not balance the accumulating emissions. Diurnal variation observed at a low-pollution site follows seasonal wind patterns.A weekday–weekend effect analysis shows good agreement between the different products. However, the GEMS L2 product, while agreeing with the other data sets on weekdays, shows significantly less reduction on weekends.The influence of the stratospheric contribution and the surface reflectivity product on the satellite tropospheric NO2 VCD products is investigated. While the TM5 model's stratospheric VCDs, used in the TROPOMI product, are too high, resulting in tropospheric NO2 VCDs that are too low and even negative, when used in the GEMS IUP-UB retrieval, the GEMS L2 stratospheric VCD is too low. Surface reflectivity comparisons indicate that the GEMS L2 reflectivity makes a large contribution to the observed overestimation and scatter."

The methodology exploits synergies between spectrometers and imagers, like TROPOMI and VIIRS. The largest improvements have been identified for heterogeneous scenes at cloud edges. This approach is generic and can also be applied to future Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 instruments. 
 The retrieval of cloud parameters from the atmospheric Sentinel missions requires Earth reflectance measurements from a set of spectral bands. The ground pixels of the involved spectral bands should be fully aligned, but when they are not, special treatment is required within the operational algorithms. This so-called inter-band spatial misregistration of passive spectrometers is present when the Earth reflectance measurements in different spectral bands are captured by different spectrometers. The cloud retrieval algorithm requires reflectance measurements in the UV(ultraviolet)–VIS (visible) band, where the first cloud parameter (i.e., radiometric cloud fraction) is retrieved from OCRA (Optical Cloud Recognition Algorithm). In addition, Earth reflectances in the NIR (near-infrared) band are needed for the retrieval of two additional cloud parameters (i.e., cloud height and cloud albedo or cloud-top height and optical thickness) from the ROCINN (Retrieval of Cloud Information using Neural Networks) algorithm. In the former TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument)/S5P (Sentinel-5 Precursor) retrieval, a coregistration scheme of the derived cloud parameters from the source band to the target band based on pre-calculated mapping weights from UV–VIS to NIR and vice versa is applied. In this paper we present a new scheme for the coregistration of the TROPOMI cloud parameters using collocated VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite)/SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) information. The new coregistration scheme based on the VIIRS data improves the TROPOMI cloud product quality and allows the addition of cloud information for the first (westernmost) TROPOMI UVIS ground pixel. In practice, the latter means that a significant number of valid data points are included in the TROPOMI cloud, total ozone, SO2 and HCHO product since 26 November 2023 (orbit 31705), when the new coregistration scheme became operational. From a comparison analysis between the two techniques, we found that the largest differences mainly appear for inhomogeneous scenes. From a validation exercise of TROPOMI against VIIRS in the across-track direction, we found that the old coregistration scheme tends to smooth out cloud structures along the scan line, whereas such structures can be maintained with the new scheme. The need to implement a similar inter-band spatial coregistration scheme is foreseen for the Sentinel-4/MTG-S (Meteosat Third Generation – Sounder) and Sentinel-5/MetOp-SG (Meteorological Operational Satellite – Second Generation) missions. In the case of the Sentinel-4 instrument, the external cloud information will originate from collocated data captured by the FCI (Flexible Combined Imager) on board the MTG-I (Meteosat Third Generation – Imager) satellite."

In this paper we collect and make a synthesis of a body of these observations since 1972 in order to provide researchers modeling Earth's climate and developing satellite observations from space with a simple way of confronting their results and understanding their validity. 
 Mineral dust aerosol is important in the Earth system, and the correct representation of its size distribution is fundamental for shaping the current state and evolution of the climate. Despite many observational dust size data that are available in the literature, using this body of information to properly guide the development and validation of climate models and remote sensing retrievals remains challenging. In this study we collect, evaluate, harmonize, and synthesize 58 size distribution data from the past 50 years of in situ field observations with the aim of providing a consistent dataset to the community for use in constraining the representation of dust size across its life cycle. Four levels (LEVs) of data treatment are defined, going from original data (LEV0), data interpolated and normalized on a standardized diameter grid (LEV1), and data in which original particle diameters are converted to a common geometrical definition under both spherical (LEV2a) and aspherical (LEV2b) assumptions. Size distributions are classified as emission or source (SOURCE, <1 d from emission; number of datasets in this category N=12), mid-range transport (MRT, 1–4 d of transport; N=36), and long-range transport (LRT, >4 d of transport; N=10). The harmonized dataset shows consistent features suggesting the conservation of airborne particles with time and a decrease in the main coarse-mode diameter from a value on the order of 10 µm (in volume) for SOURCE dust to a value on the order of 1–2 µm for LRT conditions. An additional mode becomes evident below 0.4 µm for MRT and LRT dust. Data for the three levels (LEV1, LEV2a, and LEV2b) and the three categories (SOURCE, MRT, and LRT), together with statistical metrics (mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and standard deviation), are available as follows:

 We present top-down global gridded emissions of NOx for the year 2022. This dataset is constructed from retrievals of tropospheric vertical column densities of NO2 by the TROPOMI spaceborne instrument associated with winds and atmospheric composition data from ECMWF reanalyses, using an improved version of a mass-balance atmospheric inversion. The emissions are provided with a spatial resolution of 0.0625°×0.0625° and deliver a detailed overview of the distribution of emissions. They allow the identification of intense area sources and isolated emitters, and the quantification of their associated emissions. At global level, the emissions obtained are consistent with the EDGARv6.1 bottom-up inventory, although there are differences at regional level, particularly in emerging countries and countries with low observation densities. The three largest emitting countries, China, the United States and India, are 11, 16 and 6 % lower than EDGAR estimates. Uncertainties remain high, and a quantitative analysis of emissions over several averaging periods indicates that averaging emissions uniformly across the year may be sufficient to obtain estimates consistent with annual averages, in regions of the world with high retrieval densities.

The new aerosol and precipitation acidity diagnostics showed good agreement against observational datasets. 
 The atmospheric composition forecasting system used to produce the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) forecasts of global aerosol and trace gas distributions, the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS-COMPO), undergoes periodic upgrades. In this study we describe the development of the future operational cycle 49R1 and focus on the implementation of the thermodynamical model EQSAM4Clim version 12, which represents gas–aerosol partitioning processes for the nitric acid–nitrate and  ammonia–ammonium couples and computes diagnostic aerosol, cloud, and precipitation pH values at the global scale. This information on aerosol acidity influences the simulated tropospheric chemistry processes associated with aqueous-phase chemistry and wet deposition. The other updates of cycle 49R1 concern wet deposition, sea-salt aerosol emissions, dust optics, and size distribution used for the calculation of sulfate aerosol optics. The implementation of EQSAM4Clim significantly improves the partitioning of reactive nitrogen compounds, decreasing surface concentrations of both nitrate and ammonium in the particulate phase, which reduces PM2.5 biases for Europe, the US, and China, especially during summertime. For aerosol optical depth there is generally a decrease in the simulated wintertime biases and for some regions an increase in the summertime bias. Improvements in the simulated Ångström exponent are noted for almost all regions, resulting in generally good agreement with observations. The diagnostic aerosol and precipitation pH calculated by EQSAM4Clim have been compared to ground observations and published simulation results. For precipitation pH, the annual mean values show  relatively good agreement with the regional observational datasets, while for aerosol pH the simulated values over continents are quite close to those simulated by ISORROPIA II. The use of aerosol acidity has a relatively smaller impact on the aqueous-phase production of sulfate compared to the changes in gas-to-particle partitioning induced by the use of EQSAM4Clim."

We present an update of the atmospheric transport model FLEXPART. FLEXPART 11 is more accurate due to a reduced number of interpolations and a new scheme for wet deposition. It can simulate non-spherical aerosols and includes linear chemical reactions. It is parallelised using OpenMP and includes new user options. A new user manual details how to use FLEXPART 11. 
 Numerical methods and simulation codes are essential for the advancement of our understanding of complex atmospheric processes. As technology and computer hardware continue to evolve, the development of sophisticated code is vital for accurate and efficient simulations. In this paper, we present the recent advancements made in the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART), a Lagrangian particle dispersion model, which has been used in a wide range of atmospheric transport studies over the past 3 decades, extending from tracing radionuclides from the Fukushima nuclear disaster, to inverse modelling of greenhouse gases, and to the study of atmospheric moisture cycles.This version of FLEXPART includes notable improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency. (1) By leveraging the native vertical coordinates of European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) instead of interpolating to terrain-following coordinates, we achieved an improvement in trajectory accuracy, leading to a ∼8 %–10 % reduction in conservation errors for quasi-conservative quantities like potential vorticity. (2) The shape of aerosol particles is now accounted for in the gravitational settling and dry-deposition calculation, increasing the simulation accuracy for non-spherical aerosol particles such as microplastic fibres. (3) Wet deposition has been improved by the introduction of a new below-cloud scheme, by a new cloud identification scheme, and by improving the interpolation of precipitation. (4) Functionality from a separate version of FLEXPART, the FLEXPART CTM (chemical transport model), is implemented, which includes linear chemical reactions. Additionally, the incorporation of Open Multi-Processing parallelisation makes the model better suited for handling large input data. Furthermore, we introduced novel methods for the input and output of particle properties and distributions. Users now have the option to run FLEXPART with more flexible particle input data, providing greater adaptability for specific research scenarios (e.g. effective backward simulations corresponding to satellite retrievals). Finally, a new user manual (https://flexpart.img.univie.ac.at/docs/, last access: 11 September 2024) and restructuring of the source code into modules will serve as a basis for further development."

In this study, Ru- and Nb-co-modified CeO2 catalysts were designed to achieve excellent activity, stability, and CO2 selectivity in the catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC). The formation of Nb–O–Ce bonds was observed to enhance the surface acidic sites, thereby improving HCl selectivity and reducing the production of chlorinated byproducts. Meanwhile, it inhibits the formation of Ru–O–Ce and promotes the generation of highly dispersed RuO2 particles on the surface, enhancing the redox properties and mobility of the surface oxygen, thus increasing CO2 selectivity. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results revealed that chlorine species preferentially attach to Nb species rather than to oxygen vacancies on the Ru/Nb/CeO2 catalyst. This allows more alkane groups to oxidize to formate on the oxygen vacancies, reducing byproduct concentration. Additionally, the oxidation of alkane groups to carboxylic acids is initiated on the Nb species, completing a comprehensive oxidation process under the synergistic effect of RuO2."

Composting will likely be the primary alternative to landfilling, and 75–100 new large-scale composting facilities must be sited in the state to meet its diversion goal. We developed a strategy for evaluating site suitability for commercial composting by incorporating land-use, economic, and environmental justice criteria. In our Baseline scenario, we identified 899 candidate sites, and nearly all are within a cost-effective hauling distance of cropland and rangelands for compost application. About half of  sites, mostly in rural areas, are not within a cost-effective collection distance of enough municipal organics to supply an average-sized facility. Conversely, sites near cities have greater access to organics but cause greater health damages from ammonia and volatile organic compounds emitted during the composting process. The additional required composting capacity corresponds to $266–355 million in annual damages from air pollution. However, this excludes avoided emissions from landfilling, and damages could be reduced by 56% if aerated static piles are used instead of windrows. Siting a higher number of smaller decentralized facilities could also help equally distribute air pollution to avoid concentrating burdens in certain communities."

Prior research, primarily case‐based, did not fully grasp the nature of TRCs. Utilizing an objective TRC identification method, we categorized 65 TRC tracks in East Asia into five types and examined their traits and precipitation links. The findings indicate that the moisture transport height of TRCs varies due to multiple factors, with higher transport linked to the warm conveyor belt and lower transport attributed to Taiwan’s mountain range influencing low‐level moisture. The precipitation peak altitudes of TRCs at higher latitudes are greater, and their precipitation intensity is positively correlated with terrain type, especially coastlines. This study underscores the diversity in TRC characteristics and related precipitation, suggesting that future research should consider the directionality of TRC tracks."

The Canadian Earth System Model CanESM5, part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), reasonably reproduces this pattern and its formation mechanisms. Future projections under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 8.5 (SSP5‐8.5) suggest a significant weakening of WACNA with global warming. Notable changes in pattern intensity and spatial structure are anticipated, particularly a decrease in intensity over the CBS.

Our results show a forest cover increase of 6.2% (59.2 Mha) over this period and a woody biomass carbon sink of 208.6 ± 51.8 TgC yr−1, consistent with the national inventories. The conservation of forest and woodland areas made an unexpectedly large contribution (59.2%) to the observed sink, with an additional 29.4% from anthropogenic expansion. Of these management-driven sinks, 53.7% (99.2 TgC yr−1) is attributed to a direct management effect and the remaining 46.3% to the effects of environmental changes. China’s ecological restoration projects contributed 73.5% of the direct management effect. Our study provides satellite-based evidence to support China’s inventories and underscores the crucial role of human management in the nation’s woody carbon balance. Growing biomass carbon stock in China between 2001 and 2020 is driven by conservation and anthropogenic expansion of woodland."

 The impacts of Arctic sea ice loss on summertime weather in the Northern Hemisphere have garnered considerable attention. Despite the extensive focus on this relationship, the influence of tropical systems on Arctic regions has been relatively underexplored, with only a limited number of existing studies concentrating exclusively on either dynamic or thermodynamic effects. This study aims to address this gap by examining a barotropic anomalous circulation over the Arctic region associated with Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) rainfall. The observed anomalous circulation exhibits a distinct zonally dipole pattern, characterized by anomalous high pressure over Northern Canada and Asia, coupled with anomalous low pressure located east of Greenland. Verification through model experiments demonstrates that the diabatic heating of ISM rainfall contribute to the formation of the observed ISM-related circulation. The modulation of surface clear sky downwelling longwave radiation (

               increases, leading to a decline in sea ice thickness, and vice versa. Additionally, from a dynamic standpoint, low-level wind-driven sea ice drift helps shape the spatial distribution and extent of sea ice cover. Besides, the impacts of ISM on Arctic sea ice are largely independent of contemporary ENSO. These findings present fresh perspectives on the role of extrapolar phenomena, such as the ISM, in driving variability in Arctic sea ice during the summer months. This enhanced comprehension holds promise for enhancing predictions of changes in summertime Arctic sea ice extent."

 Atmospheric aerosol radiative effects regulate surface air pollution (O3 and PM2.5) via both the aerosol–photolysis effect (APE) and the aerosol–radiation feedback (ARF) on meteorology. Here, we elucidate the roles of APE and ARF on surface O3 and PM2.5 in the heavily polluted megacity, Delhi, India by using a regional model (WRF-Chem) with constraints from limited surface observations. While APE reduces surface O3 (by 6.1%) and PM2.5 concentrations (by 2.4% via impeding the secondary aerosol formations), ARF contributes to a 2.5% and 17.5% increase in surface O3 and PM2.5, respectively. The ARF from smoke enhances PM2.5 (by 8%), black carbon (by 10%), and primary organic aerosol (by 18%) during late autumn when crop residue burning is significant. The synergistic APE and ARF have a negligible impact on the total concentrations of O3 and PM2.5. Hence, the reduction of PM2.5 may lead to O3 escalation due to weakened APE. Sensitivity experiments indicate the need and effectiveness of reducing VOC emission for the co-benefits of mitigating both O3 and PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi."

 This study investigates interactions between methylglyoxal (MGL) and 29 different samples, such as clays, proxies and natural dusts from the arid regions of the planet. Initial and quasi steady state uptake coefficients (ɣ0 and ɣqss) of MGL are determined using a Knudsen cell at concentration of 70 ppb, under dry conditions. Remarkably high ɣ0 values for MGL, ranging from 0.05 to 0.67, are determined, close to those of radical species, suggesting a high affinity for dusts. ɣ0 is evidenced to be linearly correlated with the Al/Si ratio of dust samples, indicating a specific initial affinity of MGL with aluminum surface sites. Ɣqss, determined after 40 min of exposure, ranges from 2.9 × 10−7 to 5.9 × 10−6. Ɣqss is linearly correlated with Ti/Si ratio, highlighting specific affinity of MGL with titanium. The impact of concentration on ɣqss is investigated on Gobi dust with MGL concentrations ranging from 0.1 ppt to 2.2 ppm. Ɣqss increases when MGL concentration decreases. Under typical dust storm conditions, MGL uptake competes with gas phase removal by OH radicals or photolysis. In addition, the maximum storage capacity of MGL by samples is determined at 2 ppm with Knudsen cell. MGL uptake does not exceed a compact monolayer on natural dust samples, whereas on some surrogates multilayer uptake is reached. Comparison of ɣ0 and ɣqss of glyoxal and MGL shows that MGL generally exhibits higher affinity with samples. The maximum number of molecules taken up by Gobi dust (Nmax) of MGL is compared with those for isoprene, isopropanol and acetic acid retrieved from literature. It points at the dependance of Nmax on chemical functionality of VOCs: oxygenated compounds exhibit higher interactions with dust. Data are available to increase the representativeness of modeling."

To understand and explain contributions to global temperature changes, many emission-based metrics have been employed, such as CO2-equivalent or -forcing equivalent. None of these metrics, however, include dynamic responses from Earth system feedbacks in terms of carbon and heat redistribution, known to play an increasingly important role in ambitious mitigation scenarios. Here we introduce a framework that allows for an assessment of such feedbacks in addition to CO2, non-CO2 anthropogenic forcing and natural external variability contributions. FROT (Framework for Radiative cOntributions to Temperature response) allows for an assessment of components of direct radiative impact to the system (climate forcing), as well as Earth system feedbacks concerning heat and carbon. The framework is versatile in terms of applications and allows for exploring individual components contributions to, for example, temperature stabilisation simulations, or comparisons in different models and scenarios, as it can reasonably explain their simulated temperature variability. Here, we apply FROT to both an intermediate complexity and a fully coupled Earth system model, as we simulate highly ambitious mitigation scenarios. Comparing temperature stabilisation scenarios, we can show that both net-zero CO2 emissions and small amounts of positive CO2 emissions could lead to a stable global temperature trajectory. Our assessment reveals that the effects of non-CO2 climate forcings, especially the development of sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere, and the dynamics of the carbon cycle, play a pivotal role in the final level of warming and in enabling a temperature stabilisation. Under highly ambitious climate mitigation scenarios it becomes crucial to include Earth system feedbacks, specifically ocean heat uptake, to understand interannual to decadal temperature development, since previously secondary processes now become increasingly dominant. Our framework offers the opportunity to do so."

Despite accelerated technological efforts to radically reduce global carbon dioxide emissions, rapid reductions in methane emissions are needed to limit near-term warming. Being primarily emitted as a byproduct from agricultural activities and energy extraction, methane is currently monitored via bottom–up (i.e. activity level) or top–down (via airborne or satellite retrievals) approaches. However, significant methane leaks remain undetected and emission rates are challenging to characterize with current monitoring frameworks. In this paper, we study the design of a layered monitoring approach that combines bottom–up and top–down approaches as an integrated sensing network. By recognizing that varying meteorological conditions and emission rates impact the efficacy of bottom–up monitoring, we develop a probabilistic approach to optimal sensor placement in its bottom–up network. Subsequently, we derive an inverse Bayesian framework to quantify the improvement that a design-optimized integrated framework has on emission-rate quantifications and their uncertainties. We find that under realistic meteorological conditions, the overall error in estimating the true emission rates is approximately 1.3 times higher, with their uncertainties being approximately 2.4 times higher, when using a randomized network over an optimized network, highlighting the importance of optimizing the design of integrated methane sensing networks. Further, we find that optimized networks can improve scenario coverage fractions by more than a factor of 2 over experimentally-studied networks, and identify a budget threshold beyond which the rate of optimized-network coverage improvement exhibits diminishing returns, suggesting that strategic sensor placement is also crucial for maximizing network efficiency."

However, the effect of changing particulate deposition onto solar panel surfaces on solar power production efficiency (i.e., soiling) has not been studied. We therefore characterize probabilistic outcomes across multiple climate models and scenarios. We find large current regional losses (up to 40% without manual cleaning, up to 20% with monthly cleaning and rain removal) in generation that grow slightly under a high-emission scenario, largely due to regional increases in windblown dust. In contrast, under a low-emissions scenario, potential production increases significantly (2–8% interquartile range with only rain removal) due to reduced soiling, especially in regions of Asia and Africa where anthropogenic aerosols are major contributors to soiling. Projected changes vary widely across models in many dusty areas outside of the Sahara and Arabia. Differences can also be large in regions dominated by anthropogenic aerosols, such as Nigeria, eastern China, and northern India, where the full range across modeled potential power production changes extends from −1 to +11% for the end of the century (without manual cleaning), underscoring the need to consider multiple climate models. With large increases in projected solar power deployment, the relatively small potential production increases reported here could nevertheless represent a large dividend in additional energy production. Hence, reductions in air pollution attributable to decarbonization could provide positive feedback under which a greater deployment of solar power (or other renewables) increases the production of solar power, facilitating the transition to renewable energy."

This study extends this work by examining how spatial gradients in free tropospheric moisture influence TC development through their impact on environmental radiative heating. We conduct a series of idealized model experiments in which only the longwave radiative heating due to water vapor is modified in the environmental region outside of the TC area. These experiments demonstrate that a vortex in a drier environmental free troposphere experiences faster development. Moreover, weaker vortices actually require a dry environmental free troposphere to develop. The accelerated genesis mainly results from a stronger spatial gradient in moisture‐induced radiative heating, which enhances energy convergence through a stronger transverse circulation.

This moisture is rapidly overprinted by low‐latitude moisture advected poleward during WAI. In summer under low SIC, moisture is supplied through evaporation from land and ocean, with moisture removal via liquid‐cloud and dew formation. The isotopic composition reflects the influence of higher relative humidity at the evaporation sites.

Ruby Leung",Unveiling the Urban Impact on Mesoscale Convective System Rainfall in the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration Under Typical Synoptic Backgrounds,"Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), the primary drivers of extreme rainfall over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) urban agglomeration, are strongly influenced by synoptic circulations and local geographical environments, including water bodies and topography. However, the urban impact on MCS rainfall under various synoptic backgrounds remain inadequately understood. Using a 20‐year high‐resolution MCS tracking database and self‐organizing map clustering, three typical backgrounds for MCSs, namely weak monsoon‐like, strong monsoon‐like, and low‐pressure system (Types‐1 to 3), impacting the PRD are identified. These backgrounds exhibit pronounced disparities in MCS tracks and temporal variations as well as rainfall distributions. Urban heat island (UHI) significantly alters the spatial patterns under Types‐1 and 2. Specifically, under weak UHI condition, MCS rainfall typically occurs offshore in the morning and shifts inland in the afternoon driven by the land‐sea breeze. However, UHI modifies the low‐level thermal structure, leading to anomalous convergence and instability, which causes morning rainfall to concentrate near coastal cities, while afternoon rainfall expands further inland to the northern rural region. Additionally, the strong southwesterly winds associated with Type‐2 enhance the interaction between topography and urban impact, resulting in even higher rainfall anomalies (+28.9%) over the northeastern region. The findings highlight the crucial role of urban impact and their synergistic effect with synoptic backgrounds and other land surface processes on MCSs."

Faber;A. Rocha‐Lima;P. Colarco;B. Baker,Evaluation of 10‐m Wind Speed From ISD Meteorological Stations and the MERRA‐2 Reanalysis: Impacts on Dust Emission in the Arabian Peninsula,"
Mineral dust is one of the most important aerosols when studying the radiative balance and climate of the planet. There are different dust emission schemes utilized by the atmospheric modeling communities, many of which disagree on basic output quantities such as mass of dust emitted and distribution of mass among size bins. In this work, we examined mineral dust emission from a leading model scheme, the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART), as utilized in the Modern‐Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA‐2) Reanalysis and compared it to dust emissions calculated using wind measurements from ground based weather stations located in the Arabian Peninsula that are included in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) integrated surface database (ISD). An intercomparison of 10‐m wind speed is shown for the Arabian Peninsula region, differences of the observed and modeled wind field are quantified, and impacts of differences on dust emissions are calculated. This analysis shows 10‐m winds in the ISD were generally lower than MERRA‐2 winds, which propagated to dust emissions errors. Our estimate of one of the most significant mass impacts in dust emission is 0.178 Tg/year/grid box with a percent change of over 200% to the recalculated dust emissions from MERRA‐2. These differences in wind speed propagated to a difference in dust mass emitted by the use of a static source function which aids in scaling the mass emitted by the availability of dust in each grid. Additionally, the magnitude of these differences varies seasonally."

We revisit such a temperature (T‐) dependency globally, leveraging TROPOMI HCHO column data. We find substantial variations in the T‐dependency of biogenic HCHO across plant functional types (PFTs), with the highest over Broadleaf Evergreen Tropical Trees (doubling every 6.0 K ± 4.1 K) and lowest over Arctic C3 Grass (doubling every 30.8 K ± 9.6 K). The GEOS‐Chem model interprets HCHO columns' T‐dependency at the PFT level (r = 0.87), with a 16% discrepancy on average. The discrepancy can be explained by BVOC emissions T‐dependency for Broadleaf Evergreen Tropical Trees and Warm C4 Grass and can be attributed to the insensitivity of HCHO columns to BVOC emissions for other PFTs. Our findings underscore a potentially magnified variation of BVOC emissions by GEOS‐Chem and MEGAN therein, particularly in regions experiencing greater temperature variations."

Rimbu;T. Spiegl;M. Ionita;S. Doshi;G. Lohmann,A Synoptic Scale Perspective of Solar Forcing on Extreme Precipitation and Floods Over Europe During Summer,"
The relationship between total solar irradiance (TSI) forcing and summer extreme precipitation and flood frequency over western Europe is investigated from a synoptic‐scale perspective, with a focus on the role of Rossby wave packets (RWPs). Utilizing observational, model, and proxy data, we reveal a significant increase in RWP frequency along a zonal band centered around 50°N, extending from North America to western Europe, during periods of low TSI. This anomaly in RWP frequency is consistent with a significant increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events recorded over western Europe. Sensitivity experiments conducted with a state‐of‐the‐art chemistry‐climate model corroborate our findings based on observational data. Additionally, a flood record from western Europe demonstrates a significant increase in flood frequency during low TSI years, a relationship that persists across timescales. We argue that the frequency patterns associated with TSI forcing presented in this study are robust and, therefore, valuable for estimating the frequency of extreme precipitation events over western Europe under various solar irradiance scenarios. Moreover, our findings indicate that the North Atlantic sector is more responsive to changes in solar forcing during the boreal summer than previously thought, with this effect manifesting primarily on synoptic timescales rather than the long‐term climatological mean."

The growth of these clusters from ∼2 to >10 nm diameters is often driven by the availability of extremely low volatility organic vapors (ELVOCs). Although the pathways to ELVOC formation from the oxidation of biogenic terpenes are better understood, the mechanistic pathways for ELVOC formation from oxidation of anthropogenic organics are less well understood. We integrate measurements and detailed regional model simulations to understand the processes governing NPF and secondary organic aerosol formation at the Southern Great Plain (SGP) observatory in Oklahoma and compare these with a site within the Bankhead National Forest (BNF) in Alabama, southeast USA. During our two simulated NPF event days, nucleation rates are predicted to be at least an order of magnitude higher at SGP compared to BNF largely due to lower sulfuric acid (H2SO4) concentrations at BNF. Among the different nucleation mechanisms in WRF‐Chem, we find that the dimethylamine (DMA) + H2SO4 nucleation mechanism dominates at SGP. We find that anthropogenic ELVOCs are critical for explaining the growth of particles observed at SGP. Treating organic particles as semisolid, with strong diffusion limitations for organic vapor uptake in the particle phase, brings model predictions into closer agreement with observations. We also simulate two non‐NPF event days observed at the SGP site and show that low‐level clouds reduce photochemical activity with corresponding reductions in H2SO4 and anthropogenic ELVOC concentrations, thereby explaining the lack of NPF."

 Over the past two decades, climate change has led to the intensification of the hydrologic cycle and greatly altered global land evapotranspiration (ET). Existing low-resolution evapotranspiration datasets, though valuable for global estimates, does not fully capture spatial heterogeneity and local-scale effects, necessitating the need for higher-resolution assessment of field-scale ET for enhanced accuracy. Here, we examine trends in global land ET over the past three decades using more than four million thermal Landsat satellite images. We employ the validated and scalable Hybrid Single-source Energy Balance model (HSEB) to generate the first monthly 100-m resolution ET dataset from 1990 to 2021, allowing us to examine the inter and intra-annual variability in global land ET trends. Our analysis unveils a significant global increase in ET over the last two decades at an annual rate of 1.33 (±0.84) mm yr−1 (0.2 %), despite regional disparities. This rate intensifies to 0.47 % and 1.97–2.15 % in the recent twelve and seven years of the study, mainly due to summer ET increases over North America, African tropics, and Indochina. We show that 21 % of the land area experiences a notable increase in evapotranspiration, notably in regions like Amazonia, Congo, Southeast and Midwest North America, Mediterranean Europe, and central China, while 11.6 % shows a significant decrease, particularly in southwestern North America, Southern South America, western Russia, and parts of West Asia. Tropical and subtropical regions exhibit the most pronounced increases. In recent years, the increase in vapor pressure deficit and greening, fueled by rising temperatures, align with the positive global ET trend. Our study signifies the profound influence of climate change on evapotranspiration.

Crawford,"Grounding-line retreat of Milne Glacier, Ellesmere Island, Canada over 1966–2023 from satellite, airborne, and ground radar data","•The Milne Glacier grounding line retreated ∼3 km over the last 57 years. •The grounding line retreat was more pronounced on the western side of the glacier. •RCM provided the most detailed spatiotemporal information on hinge line variability. •Ground radar transects delineated grounded and floating glacier sections. •Satellite, airborne, and ground radar-derived grounding line positions agreed well. 
 Milne Glacier is a marine-terminating glacier located on the northern coast of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic, a region that has experienced extensive ice-mass loss over the last two decades. Milne Glacier flows into Milne Fiord where it transitions from grounded to floating at its grounding line. The glacier rests on a retrograde slope and is therefore potentially vulnerable to marine ice-sheet instability where enhanced basal melt and grounding-line retreat can trigger further deterioration of the glacier. Glacier changes that occur in the ice flexure zone, which spans from the hinge line, the inland limit of tidal flexure, past the grounding line to the landward limit of hydrostatic equilibrium, are critical for glacier dynamics. In this study, we quantify changes in the Milne Glacier grounding-line position from 1966 to 2023 using satellite, airborne, and ground radar observations. Double difference interferometric analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (DDInSAR) images acquired between 1992 and 2023 from European Remote Sensing (ERS-1/2) satellites, Sentinel-1 A/B, and RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) was performed to delineate a timeseries of the hinge line. We used these hinge lines to quantify changes in the grounding-line position as their migration rates are directly correlated. RCM-derived results had the highest spatial resolution (10 m) and the best coherence between 4-day repeat acquisitions, which provided the most continuous and detailed hinge-line delineation across the glacier. We also used airborne and ground-based ice penetrating radar (IPR) data collected between 2014 and 2023 to calculate the normalized bed reflection (NBRP) and internal reflection power (NIRP) coefficients to distinguish between basal returns associated with water versus bed and assess signal attenuation within the ice column. Spatial patterns in NBRP and NIRP coefficients allowed us to reliably separate the floating and grounded parts of Milne Glacier. This alternate way of delineating the grounding line was in good agreement with our satellite-based DDInSAR results. Analysis of historical airborne radar surveys in 1966 and 1981 in conjunction with our more recent NBRP/NIRP analysis revealed a ∼3.1 km retreat (or ∼55 m yr−1) of the grounding line along the glacier centerline over the past 57 years. DDInSAR analysis provided additional details on this shift across the Milne Glacier. ERS and RCM images acquired in 3 and 4-day repeat cycles, respectively, revealed variability in hinge-line positions. This information allowed us to estimate the landward and seaward bounds, associated with the short-term hinge-line migration, that were used to quantify the grounding-line retreat over years. The grounding line retreat was highly asymmetric with the grounding-line retreating at over twice the average rate near the western margin (124 m yr−1) than at the center (53 m yr−1) of the glacier between 2011 and 2023. The calculated average retreat rates of grounding line showed a close association with changes in the ocean temperatures and subglacial discharge. Our study demonstrated that satellite-based monitoring of the hinge line at high spatiotemporal resolution is crucial to better assess the grounding line short-term positional variability and reliably quantify its long-term retreat. Airborne and ground-based radar observations can provide additional in-situ information to explain changes in the grounding line that affect glacier dynamics and viability."

 A profound comprehension of the key determinants behind the fluctuations in surface solar radiation (SSR) over decadal timescales is essential for advancing the fields of energy meteorology, climatology, and solar resources. While there is a general agreement among prior research on the significant impact of aerosols on SSR, a granular understanding of the specific influence that varying aerosol types exert on SSR remains elusive. This investigation delves into the respective impacts of aerosols and cloud radiative effects across China, utilizing data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). It further dissects the distinct impacts of different aerosol types on the decadal-scale variations in SSR, employing spectral aerosol optical depths derived from the MODIS aerosol products. The findings reveal a predominantly positive trend in SSR, ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 W/m2/yr between the years 2011 and 2022 for the majority of China's regions. However, certain areas within Northeast and Western China exhibit a decline in SSR exceeding −1 W/m2/yr. Notably, in Eastern China, a downward trend in aerosol radiative effect is observed, with a pronounced reduction of approximately −2 W/m2/yr noted specifically during the summer in Northern China. The study infers that the reduction in urban industrial emissions and biomass burning aerosols is linked to the acceleration of the brightening phenomenon in China. Our results underscore that stringent regulation of anthropogenic emissions could yield dual benefits: environmental amelioration and an upsurge in solar resource. These insights merit serious contemplation in the formulation of future policy and decision-making frameworks."

 Clouds are one of the most significant and uncertain components in weather forecasting and climate prediction. The 20-year detailed liquid water cloud effective radius (CER) over China from 2001 to 2020 are systematically studied based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud products. The spatial distributions of CER show slight alterations of seasonal patterns of changes over China during 2001–2020. The monthly mean CER values over China vary from 12.7 μm in November to nearly 14.4 μm in July. The summer season has the largest average CER, followed by spring and winter, while autumn exhibits relatively lower CER levels over China. The mean CER values during 2001–2020 are found to be 14.7, 11.8 and 13.0 μm over the Tibetan Plateau, inland and coastal regions of China, respectively. High CERs in spring and winter are seen in the Tibet Plateau, whereas the reverse is true over the inland and coastal regions. The impacts of precipitable water vapor (PWV) and aerosol optical depth on the CER over China are complex, whereas the correlations between CER and PWV can be generally expressed by a two-stage linear fitting, showing distinct turning points in different seasons and regions.

10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107735,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了气溶胶辐射效应对塔里木盆地沙尘暴演变的影响。研究发现，气溶胶的累积辐射效应（Legacy radiative effect）在沙尘暴演变中起主导作用，它导致盆地中心地区沙尘负荷增加，边缘地区沙尘负荷减少。这种差异是由于气溶胶辐射导致盆地中心和边缘地区行星边界层（PBL）结构和环流的差异造成的。在边缘地区，气溶胶导致冷却效应，抑制了PBL发展，加速了沙尘沉降；而在中心地区，气溶胶导致增温效应，抑制了沙尘沉降，导致沙尘累积。该研究强调了在量化先前辐射效应对后续沙尘演变的影响时，考虑PBL动力学和地转平衡的重要性。  这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如利用卫星观测数据监测沙尘暴，分析大气成分（气溶胶）的时空分布，以及进行空气质量监测等。,"['Aerosol', 'Dust storm', 'Radiative effect', 'Planetary boundary layer (PBL)', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Dust loading', 'Numerical modeling']",Xiaoyan Zhang;Haishan Chen;Xiyan Xu;Xiao-Ming Hu;Lan Gao;Gensuo Jia,Legacy of aerosol radiative effect predominates daytime dust loading evolution,"•Legacy radiative effect (LRE) predominates over the asymmetric pattern of dust processes. •LRE amplifies the dust loading in central regions but has an opposite impact on marginal regions. •Reversed dust deposition flux determines the asymmetries of dust loading and concentration. •PBL dynamics and geostrophic balance are important in estimating dust evolution. 
 Dust radiative effect imposes pronounced perturbations on planetary boundary layer (PBL) development. In turn, the modified PBL characteristics and circulation fields regulate subsequent dust processes, which have not been explored sufficiently. In this study, parallel experiments are designed to isolate the instant, legacy and nonlinear impacts of aerosol radiative effect on daytime dust storm evolution over the Tarim Basin. During a typical dust storm event, legacy radiative effect is found to dominate dust loading dynamics and modulates mean dust burden by more than 16 % in the central basin and − 41 % in the marginal basin. Specifically, the dust column concentration increases in central regions but decreases in marginal regions. Dust aerosols cause opposite heating rate distributions and PBL structure between the central and marginal regions through altering radiative balance. Dust-induced cooling effect in the marginal regions leads to PBL suppression and attenuates entrainment mixing. Negative net heating also results in lowered potential temperature, elevated air pressure and thus increases their horizontal gradients. Accordingly, wind speeds are amplified through geostrophic and thermal wind effects, which further accelerate deposition rates, and eventually weaken dust suspension. In the central basin, dust plumes stimulate a warm mixing layer and unstable entrainment zone, which inhibit dry deposition removal and favor dust accumulation in the atmosphere. Our study highlights the importance of accounting PBL dynamics and geostrophic balance in quantifying the impacts of preceding radiative effect on subsequent dust evolution."

 This study thoroughly examines the impact of aerosols on atmospheric heating rates over the North Atlantic Ocean, with a specific focus on developing African easterly waves (AEWs). The analysis leverages data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) DC-8 aircraft, dropsonde profiles, lidar observations, and satellite-based precipitation data obtained during NASA's Convective Processes Experiment – Cabo Verde (CPEX-CV) field campaign, as well as the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalyses.  Using a four-stream radiative transfer model, the research specifically focuses  on days characterized by Saharan dust coinciding with a developing AEW and contrasts its findings with a notable dust-only event in June 2020. The findings reveal notable differences in shortwave (SW) heating rates of over 1.5 K d−1 between reanalysis and observations, underlining the persistent challenges in accurately representing aerosol effects in the atmosphere, even after assimilating observational data. These discrepancies were present on days with both background and high dust concentrations, emphasizing the challenges in accurately representing aerosol radiative effects in models and highlighting the urgent need for improved aerosol representation in reanalysis datasets.

Recent simulations with CNRM-AROME have shown difficulties when representing snow in the European Alps. Using remote sensing data and in situ observations, we evaluate modifications of the land surface configuration in order to improve it. We propose a new surface configuration, enabling a more realistic simulation of snow cover, relevant for climate and weather forecasting applications. 
 Snow cover modeling remains a major challenge in climate and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models even in recent versions of high-resolution coupled surface–atmosphere (i.e., at kilometer scale) regional models. Evaluation of recent climate simulations, carried out as part of the WCRP-CORDEX Flagship Pilot Study on Convection (FPSCONV) with the CNRM-AROME convection-permitting regional climate model at 2.5 km horizontal resolution, has highlighted significant snow cover biases, severely limiting its potential in mountain regions. These biases, which are also found in AROME numerical weather prediction (NWP) model results, have multiple causes, involving atmospheric processes and their influence on input data to the land surface models in addition to deficiencies of the land surface model itself. Here we present improved configurations of the SURFEX-ISBA land surface model used in CNRM-AROME. We thoroughly evaluated these configurations on their ability to represent seasonal snow cover across the European Alps. Our evaluation was based on coupled simulations spanning the winters of 2018–2019 and 2019–2020, which were compared against remote sensing data and in situ observations. More specifically, the study tests the influence of various changes in the land surface configuration, such as the use of multi-layer soil and snow schemes, the division of the energy balance calculation by surface type within a grid cell (multiple patches), and new physiographic databases and parameter adjustments. Our findings indicate that using only more detailed individual components in the surface model did not improve the representation of snow cover due to limitations in the approach used to account for partial snow cover within a grid cell.  These limitations are addressed in further configurations that highlight the importance, even at kilometer resolution, of taking into account the main subgrid surface heterogeneities and improving representations of interactions between fractional snow cover and vegetation. Ultimately, we introduce a land surface configuration, which substantially improves the representation of seasonal snow cover in the European Alps in coupled CNRM-AROME simulations. This holds promising potential for the use of such model configurations in climate simulations and numerical weather prediction both for AROME and other high-resolution climate models."

Aromatic ketone intermediate volatile organic compounds (IVOCs), as a subclass of oxygenated aromatics, were found in anthropogenic source emissions and may contribute to SOA formation. However, the SOA yields and formation pathways of aromatic ketone IVOCs remain unknown. In this study, the photooxidations of aromatic ketone IVOCs in the absence and presence of NOx were studied in an oxidation flow reactor, and the particle- and gas-phase oxidation products were measured. The maximum SOA yields of benzophenone and 1,2-diphenylethanone are 0.24 and 0.33–0.35, respectively, relatively high among oxygenated aromatics. The SOA yields in the presence of NOx are 2–3 times higher than those in the absence of NOx in the late stage of oxidation. As the photooxidation proceeds, H/C of SOA slightly increases with O/C, and a greater amount of more-oxidized ring-retaining products exists in the particle phase in the presence of NOx. Based on gas-phase products and possible reaction pathways, functionalization of benzoic acid via the phenolic pathway is favored in the presence of NOx. Thus, our study highlights the significant SOA formation from aromatic ketone IVOCs, especially in the presence of NOx during long-time photooxidation."

Over 33 individual years, we detected 3179 large windthrows. Windthrow density was greatest in the central and western Amazon regions, with ∼33% of all events occurring in ∼3% of the monitored area. Return intervals for large windthrows in the same location of these “hotspot” regions are centuries to millennia, while over the rest of the Amazon they are >10,000 years. Our data demonstrate a nearly 4‐fold increase in windthrow number and affected area between 1985 (78 windthrows and 6,900 ha) and 2020 (264 events and 32,170 ha), with more events of >500 ha size since 1990.

 Ice nucleating particles (INPs) affect the cloud radiative budget in the rapidly warming Arctic by changing the cloud liquid/ice phase balance. Dust emitted in the Arctic (Arctic dust) has been suggested to be a major contributor to INPs in the Arctic lower troposphere. However, how Arctic dust and its impacts on ice nucleation change with Arctic warming has not been explored. Here we find that the simulated dust emission flux in the Arctic (>60°N) in global model simulations increases by 20% from 1981–1990 to 2011–2020. This increase weakens the sensitivity of ice nucleation in Arctic lower tropospheric clouds to warming by 40% compared to the case without considering Arctic dust emission increases. Our results demonstrate a better understanding of the counterbalancing feedbacks of Arctic dust (i.e., increasing emissions and decreasing ice nucleation efficiency) is needed for more accurate estimates of changes in ice nucleation in the rapidly changing Arctic climate."

 The observed global mean surface temperature increase from 1998 to 2012 was slower than that since 1951. The relative contributions of all relevant factors including climate forcers, however, have not been comprehensively analyzed. Using a reduced-complexity climate model and an observationally constrained statistical model, here we find that La Niña cooling and a descending solar cycle contributed approximately 50% and 26% of the total warming slowdown during 1998-2012 compared to 1951-2012. Furthermore, reduced ozone-depleting substances and methane accounted for roughly a quarter of the total warming slowdown, which can be explained by changes in atmospheric concentrations. We identify that non-CO2 greenhouse gases played an important role in slowing global warming during 1998-2012. Together, La Niña cooling and a descending solar cycle can explain about three quarters of the warming slowdown between 1998 and 2012, whereas changes in the atmospheric levels of methane and ozone depleting substances explain the remaining quarter, according to analyses with a reduced-complexity climate model."

 Surface ozone (O3) is a critical ambient pollutant that poses significant risks to both human health and ecosystems. However, there is a scarcity of high-spatial-resolution hourly surface O3 data, which is crucial for understanding its diurnal variations. In this study, we employed a best-performing spatiotemporal artificial intelligence (AI) model to estimate 24-hourly 1-km-resolution surface O3 concentrations across China, incorporating key photochemical processes responsible for O3 formation. Our model effectively captured diurnal O3 patterns, achieving average sample-based cross-validated coefficients of determination (root-mean-square errors) of 0.89 (16.35 μg/m3) for the full day (00:00–23:00 LT), 0.92 (15.72 μg/m3) during daytime (08:00–20:00 LT), and 0.82 (16.97 μg/m3) at nighttime (20:00–08:00 LT). Typically, surface O3 levels increase after sunrise, peak around 15:00 LT, and decrease overnight, with a diurnal variation magnitude of 62 % relative to the mean level. During the daytime, we found that solar radiation (in the ultraviolet and shortwave spectra) and surface temperature explained over 42 % of the diurnal variation, while nighttime O3 levels were mainly influenced by tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (16 %), temperature (13 %), and relative humidity (12 %). In 2019, approximately 61 %, 98 %, and 100 % of populated areas in China experienced O3 exposure risks for at least one day, with maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 levels exceeding 160, 120, and 100 μg/m3, respectively. Additionally, around 70 %, 82 %, and 100 % of vegetated areas exceeded the three minimum critical thresholds for cumulative hourly O₃ exposure, as indicated by the SUM06, W126, and AOT40 indices, respectively. Notably, gross primary productivity (GPP) was the most sensitive indicator of O3 pollution across various vegetation types, showing a strong negative correlation with AOT0 (R = −0.43 to −0.59, p < 0.001)."

 Accurately identifying and classifying aerosols is a key to understanding their sources, assessing their chemical and physical changes, and comprehending their feedback mechanisms within climate system. However, existing aerosol classification methods have two limitations: First, ground remote sensing products have limited spatial coverage, and polar orbit satellite data suffer from low temporal resolution. Second, satellite-based aerosol classification methods are affected by cloud interference, resulting in data gaps. To overcome these challenges, this study utilized the extreme tree algorithm (ET) and integrated the FY-4A TOAR dataset with meteorological and geographical information, using a sequential forward selection method for optimal input feature selection. Focusing on the Asian region (70–140°E, 15–55°N), three models were used to generate hourly aerosol classification products: the Clear air-Cloud-Aerosol-Mixed cloud and aerosol (CCAM-ET) model, the Dust-Polluted dust-Other aerosols-Mixed aerosols (DPOM-ET) model under clear sky conditions, and the DPOM-ET model under non-clear sky conditions. The evaluated accuracy of the CCAM-ET model was 85%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying cloud and aerosol under various conditions. The CCAM model can achieve an accuracy of 78% when aerosols are located above clouds and 59% when they are below clouds. The DPOM-ET model achieved an evaluation accuracy of 89% for clear sky areas and 87% for non-clear sky areas, respectively, and was superior to traditional methods. Long-term data indicated a significant correlation between the distributions of different types of aerosols and human activity. Polluted dust is common in southwest China during spring and in northern China during winter. Additionally, from 2018 to 2020, dust occurrences decreased on the Indian Peninsula, while non-dust aerosols increased significantly in India and Southeast Asia."

At a background site in South China, the ozone formation potential of six nonformaldehyde OVOCs studied was equivalent to that of 3.56 ppbv of formaldehyde, more than half of which was contributed by acetaldehyde. Source apportionment incorporating photochemical age revealed that considerable fractions (52.7%–62.6%) of the OVOCs were of biogenic origin, except for ethanol, which was primarily derived from anthropogenic emissions. The oxidation of cis-/trans-2-butene explained 71.1% of the in situ acetaldehyde formation. In contrast, α/β-pinenes and isoprene contributed 73.8% and 28.4% to acetone and methylglyoxal formation, respectively. An average of 12.4% of net in situ ozone (O3) production rate was attributed to the OVOCs studied, where the biogenic fractions accounted for 59%. The changes in the O3 production rate and hydroxyl radical (OH) concentration caused by OVOCs were mainly affected by ozone formation sensitivity. The effects of primary acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde-led O3 on secondary acetaldehyde formation were weak at this background site; however, they cannot be ignored in polluted areas. This study provides a scientific basis for mitigating O3 pollution driven by biogenic emissions and OVOCs."

Large differences in the composition of inorganic aerosols from China are found between the fall and winter seasons due to differences in the long-range transport mechanism. In December, ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) from China can be efficiently transported across the ocean to Korea by the northwesterly wind, and on average, 60–80% of the nitrate comes from China. The monthly average of sulfate reaches ∼8 μg/m3, contributed equally by China and Korea. In September, long-range transport is enhanced during typhoon periods. However, NH4NO3 is largely evaporated during transport due to the higher temperature and rapid removal of NH3 and HNO3 by dry deposition in the surface layer. Meanwhile, nonvolatile (NH4)2SO4 undergoes long-range transport, resulting in high ammonium and sulfate and low nitrate concentrations. Domestic NH3 emissions dominate total ammonium concentrations due to large emissions from the agricultural sector. Sensitivity simulations indicate that while further emission reductions in China are necessary to fully reduce particulate air pollution in South Korea, reducing NH3 from domestic agricultural activities is an effective approach to improve air quality while emission control in China continues."

A community science approach was adopted for data collection and interpretation, and a partnership was formed between a local neighborhood association, university researchers, the municipal government, and the local airport authority. Community scientists placed low-cost sensors on outdoor balconies and inside homes for 28 weeks between 2020 and 2022, measuring particle number (PN) concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with diameters between 0.5 and 2.5 μm. Indoors, the PN concentrations increased during cooking and other activities. During periods with minimal indoor activities, indoor levels closely followed the outdoor signal. Median indoor/outdoor (IO) ratios varied between 0.4 and 0.87 across sampling months. Median outdoor PN concentrations varied from 1 to 4 #/cm3 and were influenced by local and regional sources. Outdoor PN concentrations were significantly correlated to PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide at a downtown reference station; the latter suggests that traffic emissions from the nearby expressway contribute to PN concentrations in the neighborhood. An analysis of outdoor ultrafine particle (UFP) data collected at a single location suggests that the airport is a source of UFP in the neighborhood.

Recent findings of NO near Gale Crater on Mars have been explained by two pathways: formation of nitric acid (HNO3) in a warm climate or formation of peroxynitric acid (HO2NO2) in a cool climate. Here, we put forth two hitherto unexplored pathways: (a) deposition of nitric/peroxynitric acid onto ice particles in a cold atmosphere, which settle quickly onto Mars' surface and (b) solar energetic particle‐induced production of nitric/peroxynitric acid. The deposition rates are enhanced and NO production is more efficient under the higher atmospheric pressures typical of Mars' ancient atmosphere. Depending on the unknown rate at which nitric/peroxynitric acid is lost from the surface, the new pathways could result in larger NO‐levels than those detected by the Mars Science Laboratory. We predict a 2:1 ratio of nitrite:nitrate would have deposited in cool surface climates with an icy atmosphere, whereas orders of magnitude more nitrate than nitrite is expected from warm surface climates."

However, the detailed effect of subregional aerosol variations remained unclear. Using idealized simulations with a dynamical climate model, this study reveals that reduced aerosol emissions from Europe and the U.S. since 1980 may have equally contributed to increased TCF over the North Atlantic, with Europe playing a major role in the decreased TCF in the South Indian Ocean and the U.S. contributing to the decrease in TCF in the South Pacific. Additionally, increased aerosol emissions from India since 1980 may have played a major role in decreasing TCF over the western North Pacific compared to increased emissions from China. TCFs are projected to decrease for most global tropics toward the end of this century due to the dominant effect of increasing greenhouse gases."

More upward planetary wave propagation in December is shown to precede the deceleration of the stratospheric polar vortex in January. This deceleration prevents the waves from continuing to propagate upward in February and favors an acceleration of the stratospheric polar vortex in March. This is associated with an increased Northern Hemisphere annular mode in March in the stratosphere and the troposphere. Trends show a moderate significance level because of strong interannual variability. Recent seasons whose anomalies project onto the trends are those for which wave‐1 anomaly constructively interferes with wave‐1 climatology in December, which occurs when there is warming in an area extending from Eastern Canada to Greenland and slight cooling over Eurasia.

For the historical period, more than half (11 out of 17) of the models underestimate ∼40% of the observed annual mean fire carbon emissions in the Arctic‐boreal region (0.20 PgC/yr) due to a wetter bias in the Arctic‐boreal regions. Spatially, there is common underestimation of the fire centers in the eastern part of Eurasian Continent and overestimation of that in Europe. With respect to the model spread, it mainly shows large spread for fire carbon emissions (surface air temperature) in Europe (high‐latitudes). For the future projection, the fire carbon emissions in the Arctic‐boreal region is projected to exceed 100% (0.5 PgC/yr until the end of the 21st century compared with ∼0.2 PgC/yr at present).

A time‐series study using a distributed lag non‐linear model to analyze the data, considering lag days. Stratified analysis was performed based on sex, seasons, and the COVID‐19 pandemic period. The burden was quantified using attributable fraction (AF) and number (AN). The study included 31,577 UGIB emergency records. Exposure to high levels of PM2.5 significantly increased the risk of UGIB emergency attendance from lag day 3 (RR: 1.012) to day 6 (RR: 1.008). High NO2 exposure also posed a significant risk from lag day 0 (RR: 1.026) to day 2 (RR: 1.014), and from lag day 5 (RR: 1.013) to day 7 (RR: 1.024). However, there was no association between UGIB and high O3 levels. The attributable burden of high‐concentration NO2 exposure was higher compared to those of PM2.5. Males and elderly individuals (≥65 years) faced a higher risk of UGIB emergencies, particularly during cold seasons. Our study suggests that both PM2.5 and NO2 exposure are associated with an increased risk of emergency attendance for UGIB. Ambient pollutant exposure has a stronger effect on UGIB in males and the elderly, particularly during cold seasons."

 Low-cost particulate matter sensors (LCS) are vital for improving the spatial and temporal resolution of air quality data, supplementing sparsely placed official monitoring stations. Despite their benefits, LCS readings can be biased due to the physical properties of aerosol particles and device limitations. An optimization model is essential to enhance LCS data accuracy. This paper presents a calibration study of the LCS network of Timișoara, Romania. The calibration began by selecting LCS devices near National Air Quality Monitoring Network (NAQMN) stations and developing parametric models, choosing the best for broader application. Plantower, Sensirion, and Honeywell sensors showed comparable accuracy. Calibration involved clusters within a 750 m radius around NAQMN stations. Models incorporating RH corrections and multiple linear regression (MLR) were fitted. The best model was validated against data from unseen sensors, leading to mean bias errors (MBE) within 9-17% and RMSEs of 33-35%, within sensor uncertainty margins. Applied to the city-wide LCS network, the model identified several stations regularly exceeding the EU daily PM10 threshold, unnoticed by NAQMN stations due to their limited coverage.

 Tropical peatland fires generate substantial quantities of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and in Indonesia are intensified during El Niño-related drought leading to severe air quality impacts affecting local and distant populations. Limited in-situ data often necessitates reliance on air quality models, like that of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, whose accuracy in extreme conditions is not fully understood. Here we demonstrate how a network of low-cost sensors around Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan during the 2019 fire season, quantified extreme air quality and city-scale variability. The data indicates relatively strong model performance. Health impacts are substantial with estimates of over 1200 excess deaths in the Palangka Raya region, over 3200 across Central Kalimantan and more than 87,000 nationwide in 2019 due to fire-induced PM2.5 exposure. These findings highlight the need for urgent action to mitigate extreme fire events, including reducing fire use and landscape remediation to prevent peat fire ignition.

Despite their importance, our understanding of their future change remains limited, largely due to inadequate representation in current climate models. Here, using a global storm‐resolving model that accurately simulates MCSs, we conclude contrasting responses to increased SST in their occurrence, that is, notable decreases over land but increases over ocean. This land‐ocean contrast is attributed to the changes in convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN). Over land, notable rises in CIN alongside moderate increases in CAPE effectively suppress (favor) weak to moderate (intense) MCSs, resulting in an overall reduction in MCS occurrences. In contrast, substantial increases in CAPE with minimal changes in CIN over ocean contribute to a significant rise in MCS occurrences. The divergent response in MCS occurrence has profound impacts on both mean and extreme precipitation."

In response to anthropogenic emissions, the summer North Atlantic storm track has weakened in recent decades and is projected to continue weakening by the end of this century. In light of growing efforts to mitigate climate change, it is crucial to assess how reversible the CO2‐induced storm track weakening is. Here, I show that under CO2 removal scenarios, the recovery timescale of the storm track is more than double its weakening period. It is found that due to a prolonged high‐latitude warming, postponing the execution of mitigation policies beyond doubling of CO2 concentrations would lead to a centennial‐scale recovery of the storms. Given the impacts of weakening summer storms on weather and extreme events, the delayed recovery of the storms might have broader regional consequences for Western Europe."
10.1029/2024JD041811,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了21世纪初东亚夏季风（EASM）撤退期降水增加的现象，以及气候变化特别是亚洲干旱地区变暖的可能成因。文章指出，华北地区秋季早期降水增加与EASM撤退延迟以及北移有关。通过分析中亚干旱区和中国-蒙古干旱区变暖对大气环流的影响，研究发现干旱区变暖增强了中高纬度高压带和东北亚异常反气旋，抑制了西风槽和冷空气活动，从而导致西风急流北移，日本海高压和西太平洋副热带高压西北伸展，维持了EASM环流的北向分量，并促进了来自西北太平洋的水汽输送，最终导致华北地区水汽辐合和降水增加。同时，中国-蒙古干旱区变暖也增加了陆海热力差异，导致东亚地区出现偶极子型环流异常，并驱动来自南海的水汽北上。因此，干旱区快速变暖抑制了西风活动和EASM的撤退，最终导致降水增加。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为对降水、温度、水汽等大气成分的观测分析以及对大气环流变化的研究，都依赖于卫星观测和地面观测等遥感技术。,"['precipitation', 'temperature', 'water vapor', 'air pressure', 'atmospheric circulation', 'satellite observations', 'climate change', 'East Asian Summer Monsoon', 'dryland warming']",Jie Zhang;Sidra Syed;Yuyang Wu;Jiang Liu,Warming Asian Drylands Inducing the Delayed Retreat of East Asian Summer Monsoon and Intensifying Autumn Precipitation in Northern China,"In the early 21st century, there was an increase in precipitation during the retreat period of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). This study aims to explore the precipitation changes and their possible causes in the context of climate change. The findings indicate that the increased precipitation primarily occurred in the Yellow—Huai River valley during the early autumn. This corresponds to a delayed retreat of the EASM with a northward shift of 0.9°N after 2002. Notably, this anomalous changes in the EASM are associated with the significant warming in two Asian dryland regions. The warming of the central Asian dryland strengthens the midlatitude high‐pressure belt and the anomaly anticyclone over northeast Asia, which restrains the development of wave troughs and westerly cold air activity. Similarly, the warming China‐Mongolia dryland enhances the anomaly anticyclone over northeast Asia through the dry soil moisture feedback and reduced latitudinal temperature gradient. These two Asian drylands thereby hold the northward shift of the westerly jet stream and the northwest extension of the Japan Sea high and the western Pacific subtropical high. These changes result in maintaining the northward EASM circulation and driving the northwest water vapor flux from the northwest Pacific, leading to moisture convergence in northern China. The China‐Mongolia dryland warming also increases the land‐sea thermal contrast, which induces a dipole pattern over East Asia and drives the northward water vapor flux from the South Sea. As a result, the rapidly warming drylands restrict westerly activity and EASM retreat, ultimately leading to increased precipitation."
10.1029/2024JD041645,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了中国东北地区春季高温事件(SHTE)的年际变化及其与大气环流的联系。研究发现，自1992/93年以来，SHTE的年际变化增强，这与北大西洋四极型海表温度异常(NAQSSTA)和春季西伯利亚积雪深度(SSSD)密切相关。NAQSSTA可以通过增加低层大气斜压性激发罗斯比波，进而影响中国东北地区的大气环流，导致高温事件的发生。西伯利亚积雪深度增加也起到了促进作用。该研究使用了相关分析和模型模拟等方法，揭示了SHTE年际变化增强的机制。虽然文中没有直接提到具体的空气质量监测或大气成分分析技术，但其研究内容与利用卫星观测数据分析大气温度、云量、辐射通量等要素密切相关，这些数据是许多大气环境遥感技术的基础。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有很强的关联性。,"['temperature', 'radiation flux', 'cloud cover', 'snow depth', 'sea surface temperature', 'geopotential height', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric circulation', 'Rossby waves']",Qixin Wen;Huopo Chen,Enhanced Interannual Variability of the Spring High‐Temperature Events Over Northeast China and the Associated Mechanisms,"The spring‐high temperature events (SHTE) over northeast China (NEC) and the related local atmospheric factors including cloud cover, radiation flux, and soil moisture exhibited an increased interannual variability after 1992/93. Correlation analyses reveal that both the North Atlantic quadrupole sea surface temperature anomalies (NAQSSTA) and the spring Siberian snow depth (SSSD) had a stronger linkage with SHTE since the early 1990s. Additionally, the interannual variability of SSSD also showed an interdecadal increase, which is a key factor in the changes of interannual variability of SHTE. Further analyses showed that the NAQSSTA could excite Rossby wave via increasing low‐level atmospheric baroclinicity during 1993–2017. One branch of the wave trains propagated eastward and the other branch propagated northeastward through the Siberian high latitudes, which eventually reached NEC together and resulted in local anomalous anticyclonic circulation and sinking motion. The latter branch could contribute to the low geopotential height and cyclonic anomalies over the Siberian high latitudes, which further favored the increase of snow depth there. Subsequently, the positive snow anomalies facilitate the more occurrences of SHTE by exacerbating the meridional thickness gradient between the polar region and mid‐latitudes and then limiting the Arctic cold air to invade into the south. Meanwhile, the positive polar‐Eurasian pattern (POL) associated with higher SSSD could guide the Rossby wave train originating from the North Atlantic to propagate northeastward, which is consistent with the SHTE‐related wave train path after 1992/93. Model results further reproduce the physical processes that linking the NAQSSTA with SHTE."

 Earth’s upper-level jet streams primarily flow in the eastward direction. They often exhibit a north-south component or waviness connected to extreme weather at the surface. Recently the upper-level eastward jet stream was found to exhibit a fast-get-faster response under climate change explained by the impact of the nonlinear Clausius-Clapeyron relation on the latitudinal density contrast. Here we show the fast-get-faster mechanism also applies to the upper-level north-south jet stream wind and the longitudinal density contrast, implying increased waviness under climate change. Arctic Sea ice loss, which has been proposed as a driver of increased waviness, cannot explain the response. It leads to a fast-get-slower waviness response at all vertical levels. We demonstrate the fast-get-faster waviness signal has emerged in reanalysis data in the Southern Hemisphere but not yet in the Northern Hemisphere. The results show the fast-get-faster mechanism explains upper-level waviness changes and highlights a tug of war between upper- and mid-level waviness under climate change. Climate change causes upper-level jet stream waviness to increase in both hemispheres, with extreme southward and northward excursions increasing faster than the mean, according to results from a fast-get-faster mechanism connecting waviness to density contrast changes."

 Fireworks are banned in many Chinese cities but never eliminated, reflecting strong public demand on this traditional activity for festival celebrations. On the other hand, the assessment of firework contributions to air pollution remains vague, raising concerns on the necessity of the mandatory bans. Here we investigated the characteristics of firework episodes in a megacity in Northeast China, based on field campaigns conducted in four successive winters during 2018–2022. Although prohibited, the firework influences remained evident during the Chinese New Year periods, as suggested by the enhancements of water-soluble potassium (K+). In addition, significant annual variations were identified for the firework episodes, with the following features observed. First, the firework-induced enrichment ratios of K+ and chloride exhibited increasing trends across years, climbing from 4.4 to 8.6 and from 1.7 to 2.9, respectively. Second, the enrichment ratio of sulfate dropped from 2.8 to 1.6, indicating that the firework contributions to sulfate decreased but remained considerable. Third, fireworks turned into an unimportant source for organic carbon and nitrate in the most recent winter of 2021–2022, with enrichment ratios of ∼1 for both species. Fourth, the firework-driven increases in fine particle concentration were as high as ∼100% for the two winters during 2019–2021, whereas the increase dropped sharply to ∼30% for 2021–2022. These variations were in line with the promotion of environmentally friendly fireworks. Our results indicated that the air pollution caused by fireworks could be reduced substantially by advanced manufacturing technologies and thus it is time to rethink the firework bans."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120896,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了2021年韩国GMAP/SIJAQ国际空气质量观测活动中使用的五个化学传输模型（CTM）的性能。该活动旨在改进地球静止环境监测光谱仪（GEMS）产品的算法，并更好地了解朝鲜半岛目前的空气污染状况。研究评估了这些CTM在模拟空气质量方面的预测性能、优势和局限性，并利用密集的测量数据和比对结果解释了观测结果和模拟结果之间的差异。结果表明，与之前的KORUS-AQ 2016活动相比，模型性能有所提高，尤其是在PM2.5的模拟方面。然而，模型仍然低估了一氧化碳（CO）浓度，并且在某些气态污染物和气溶胶成分（如NO3−、NH4+和EC）的模拟中存在偏差，这与气象输入（降水、相对湿度、夜间行星边界层高度）的准确性和排放清单的准确性有关。该研究强调了改进排放清单和气象输入数据对提高空气质量模型预测准确性的重要性，并与利用卫星观测数据（如GEMS）进行空气质量监测密切相关。,"['Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'PM2.5', 'Gaseous pollutants', 'Chemical transport models', 'Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS)', 'Emission inventory', 'Meteorological inputs']",Yesol Cha;Jong-Jae Lee;Chul Han Song;Soontae Kim;Rokjin J.

 The international field campaign, GMAP/SIJAQ 2021, was conducted in Korea from October 18th to November 25th to enhance the performance and validation of the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) products algorithm and obtain a better understanding of the current air pollution status of the Korean Peninsula. Five chemical transport models (CTMs), including CMAQ, CMAQ-GIST, CAMx, WRF-Chem, and WRF GEOS-Chem, were utilized during the campaign to assist in organizing the observation plan and identifying changes in pollutant concentrations and their spatiotemporal distribution in Korea following the Korea–United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) 2016. In this study, we evaluated the forecasting performance, strengths, and limitations of these five CTMs and their ensemble in simulating air quality. Intensive measurement data and intercomparisons were employed to explain discrepancies between observed and simulated results. A comparison of the CTM ensemble results for PM2.5 and various gaseous pollutants between the current GMAP/SIJAQ 2021 and previous KORUS-AQ 2016 campaigns showed the R-value for the total mass PM2.5 concentration increased from 0.88 to 0.94. This improvement is related to CTM updates, including the emission inventory and better reproductions of the concentrations of gaseous species. However, the models consistently underestimated carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, similar to the results from KORUS-AQ. This finding still suggests a further challenge that requires consideration of missing anthropogenic sources. The results of the ensemble model agreed well with the chemical composition of PM2.5 observed at the intensive monitoring station. However, for NO3− and NH4+, discrepancies were primarily due to inaccuracies in the meteorological inputs, such as precipitation, relative humidity (RH), and nighttime planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) in the CTMs. Hence, all models overestimated the concentration of elemental carbon (EC), therefore, it is necessary to revise EC emissions in the SIJAQv2 inventory, as these apply to unusual levels recorded in Seoul during the reference year of 2018."

 Most aqueous oxidation studies focus on single model precursors, while the photochemical aging of actual water soluble organic matter (WSOM) in particles emitted from biomass burning remains poorly understood. In this study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was first used to analyze the WSOM in smoke particles emitted from three crop straws burning. The results show that the dominant WSOM in three crop straws (CS) smoke are phenolic substances with small differences. Aqueous photochemical aging of WSOM in CS smoke was investigated under simulated sunlight exposure. High-resolution aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-AMS) analyzed aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) and it was found that the oxidation degree of aqSOA increased with prolonged aging. No obvious increase in the abundance of N-containing organic ions was observed over the course of aqueous aging. As aqueous aging progresses, the pH of the solution gradually decreases, accompanied by the continuous generation of organic acids. Studies on dithiothreitol (DTT) activity indicate that the impact of aqueous photochemical aging on health is not significant.The solution after photoaging shows relatively lower light absorption ability than the initial solution. The aqueous photochemical aging also led to a gradual reduction of fluorescence at excitation/emission = 250–260 nm/350 nm (protein-like substances) for CS smoke WSOM, suggesting the significant degradation of chromophores. However, three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) revealed that aqueous aged CS smoke WSOM contains compounds with high humification index, confirming that the fluorophore composition is altered by aqueous aging. The humic-like substance (HULIS) concentration increased for the first 3 h and then decreased, closely matching the pattern of a new fluorescence peak. Finally, GC/MS analysis of the products indicated that there was obvious decline in proportion of methoxyphenol. The results of this study are important for understanding the aqueous-phase oxidation reactions of CS smoke WSOM in the atmosphere and their light-absorption characteristics and health impacts."

Romanias,Nighttime chemistry of furanoids and terpenes: Temperature dependent kinetics with NO<sub>3</sub> radicals and insights into the reaction mechanism,"•The degree of methylation of furanoids increase the rate coefficient with NO3radicals. •NO₃ radicals dominate methylated furanoids' reaction pathway in the atmosphere, with lifetimes of only a few minutes. •The H-atom abstraction pathway, forming furanaldehydes, increases with higher methylation levels. •The study provides new insights into the kinetics and mechanism of furanoids oxidation in BB plumes. •NO₃ temperature-dependent kinetics of terpenes clarify literature discrepancies, providing reliable reference molecules. 
 In this study, the gas phase reaction of NO3 radical with three furanoids, furan (F), 2-methylfuran (2-MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (2,5-DMF) were investigated using a relative rate method in a temperature regulated atmospheric simulation chamber (THALAMOS). As part of this study, the temperature dependence of two monoterpenes, α-pinene (α-P) and 2-carene (2-C), that were used as reference molecules, is also reported. The kinetic measurements were performed in the range of 263–373 K, atmospheric pressure using zero air as bath gas. The reaction was followed using Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) to monitor in real time the mixing ratios of the investigated species.

In the case of furanoids, the negative temperature-dependence of the rate coefficients shows that the reaction mechanism is complex, indicating that the reaction involves the formation of an adduct that could lead either to NO3 addition to the double bond, as well as, in the case of 2-MF and 2,5-DMF, the H-abstraction from the methyl group attached to the ring. In addition to the kinetics measurements, the major products formed from the reaction of furan and 2,5-DMF with NO3 were studied. The two identified products from the reaction of furan with NO3, were 3H-furan-2-one (C4H4O2) and 2-butenedial (C4H4O2), formed by NO3 addition to the double bond of the furan ring. 3-Hexene-2,5-dione (C6H8O2) and 5-methylfurfural (C6H6O2) are the two major products of 2,5-DMF reaction with NO3, linked to the addition and abstraction pathways, respectively. Considering that 5-methylfurfural is the only primary product of the H elimination pathway of 2,5-DMF, the determination of its formation yields as a function of temperature, allowed us to extract the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients of the abstraction and addition pathways.Overall, the NO3 oxidation of the studied furanoids, is expected to be the dominant tropospheric loss process, in the studied temperature range."

This model accurately reconstructs the initial isotopic composition of the vapor samples. When applied to upper troposphere samples, the corrected data aligned closely with IASI satellite observations, enhancing the accuracy of drone-based measurements. 
 Traditional methodologies, such as mass spectrometry and laser spectroscopy, have been widely employed for precise water vapor isotope measurements. Nevertheless, these techniques are limited by logistical challenges in fieldwork, consequently constraining the temporal and spatial resolution of measurements. Specifically, water vapor isotope measurements are primarily limited to near-surface levels, while measurements associated with processes aloft connecting tropospheric water vapor to surface precipitation are notably scarce. Portable sampling devices, such as air bags and glass bottles, have therefore become necessary alternatives for collecting, storing, and transporting gaseous samples in diverse environments prior to analysis with less portable instruments. In drone-based high-altitude vapor sampling, air bags are preferred for their lighter weight and greater flexibility compared to glass bottles. Nevertheless, they present specific challenges, such as potential sample contamination and isotopic fractionation during storage, primarily due to the inherent permeability of air bags. Here, we developed a theoretical model for water vapor diffusion through the sampling bag surface, with parameters calibrated through laboratory experiments. This model enables the reconstruction of the initial isotopic composition of sampled vapor based on measurements obtained within the bag and from the surrounding environment. We applied this correction method to air samples collected at various pressures up to the upper troposphere using an air bag-mounted drone that we developed, thereby estimating the initial isotopic composition and uncertainty based on our observations. The corrected observations closely match the IASI satellite data.

Combining precise lab measurements with advanced simulations, we accurately determined ACSs for various gases, including reactive ones, without costly reference materials. This approach lowers uncertainty, ensures traceability to standard units, and enhances measurement reliability, making it ideal for field applications. 
 A low-cost differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) spectrometer has been calibrated using a hybrid approach in which multiple absorption cross sections (ACSs) are measured and compared with previously obtained ACSs. The ACSs obtained from the measurement in this study are referred to as precise measurement (PM) ACSs, while those obtained from the simulation are referred to as hybrid simulation (HS) ACSs. The compact UV grating spectrometer was used to measure PM ACSs at different pressures and temperatures ranging from 295.75 K to 298.15 K. The spectral range was 230–320 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.28–0.39 nm. Uncertainties were evaluated and traceable to SI units. The relative standard measurement uncertainty of the PM ACS for o-xylene, p-xylene, SO2, benzene, styrene and toluene were 3.1 %, 3.1 %, 3.1 %, 3.0 %, 3.0 % and 2.9 %. respectively. This combined relative standard uncertainty includes contributions from optical path length (1.4 %), CRM concentration (≤0.74 %), absorbance repeatability (≤1.5 %), pressure (0.78 %) and temperature (2.1 %). ACSs for reactive trace gases without CRMs were derived using the HS method. This involved convolving literature spectra with measured instrumental functions (IFs) and subsequently applying spectral fitting to achieve ACSs that are well-aligned with those that would be obtained if measured with this spectrometer. The uncertainty of the HS ACSs results from the referenced ACSs, the determination of the IFs and the fitting procedures. The uncertainty of the referenced ACSs is taken directly from the literature and ranges from 0.05 % for benzaldehyde and formaldehyde to 5 % for oxygen. The uncertainty of the IFs is 0.67 %, 0.74 % and 0.65 % in regions I, II and III respectively. The total uncertainty for HS ACS is estimated to be 0.25 % for benzaldehyde, 1.01 % for NO2, 0.95 % for formaldehyde, 0.75 % for p-cresol, 0.74 % for m-xylene, 4.13 % for phenol, 4.19 % for ethylbenzene, 2.83 % for ozone in region I, 3.51 % for ozone in region II, 5.24 % for oxygen in region I and 5.31 % for oxygen in region II, taking into account the above uncertainty components. In a laboratory measurement of a gas mixture (benzene, toluene and ortho-xylene), the difference between the measurement values of the certified reference material (CRM) produced by the gravimetric method and the DOAS measurement is 8.5 % for benzene, 1.6 % for toluene and 4.9 % for ortho-xylene. Therefore, the uncertainty of the DOAS system was estimated to be 15.2 % for benzene, 8.2 % for toluene and 11.6 % for o-xylene, taking into account the uncertainties of the ACS (≤3.1 %), the fitting procedure (≤0.6 %), the difference with the CRM value (≤8.5 %) and the path length (1.4 %). In general, the system is ready for use in field measurements using the long-path DOAS technique."
10.5194/essd-2024-493,True,Earth System Science Data Discussions,这篇论文研究了中国1961年至2022年逐日日照时数的均质化处理。研究人员发现，2019年仪器升级导致日照时数数据中出现零值频率骤降的问题，这是一种非气候因素导致的不连续性。他们开发了一种均质化方法，系统地校正了这种不连续性，并对其他非气候因素引起的不连续性进行了调整，从而得到了一个更连续、更准确的日照时数数据集。该数据集可用于更准确地评估中国区域的“变暗”和“变亮”现象，并支持其他应用，例如太阳能规划和农业管理。研究结果表明，均质化后的日照时数数据更能反映出中国大气污染防治行动计划实施后日照时数趋势的变化，以及云量和气溶胶光学厚度与日照时数之间的关系。总的来说，这项研究通过改进数据质量，提高了对中国地区气候变化和空气质量研究的精度。,"['Aerosol optical depth', 'Cloud cover fraction', 'Sunshine duration', 'Dimming and brightening', 'Air pollution', 'Surface solar radiation', 'Ground-based observation']",Yanyi He;Kaicun Wang;Kun Yang;Chunlüe Zhou;Changkun Shao;Changjian Yin,Homogenized daily sunshine duration over China from 1961 to 2022,"To address key gaps in data availability and homogeneity of sunshine duration, we compiled raw data and made a homogenization protocol to produce a homogenized daily observational dataset of sunshine duration from 1961 to 2022 in China. The dataset avoids a sharp drop in zero-value frequency after 2019, caused by the instrument upgrade, but also is more continuous for various periods. This dataset is crucial for accurately assessing the dimming and brightening, and supporting other applications. 
 Inhomogeneities in the sunshine duration (SSD) observational series, caused by non-climatic factors like China’s widespread transition from manual to automatic SSD recorders in 2019 or station relocations, have hindered accurate estimate of near-surface solar radiation for the analysis of global dimming and brightening as well as related applications, such as solar energy planning and agriculture management. This study compiled raw SSD observational data from 1961 to 2022 at more than 2,200 stations in China and clearly found that the improved precision from 0.1 hour to 1 minute following the instrument update in 2019 led to a sudden reduction in the frequency of zero SSD from 2019 onwards, referred to as the day0-type discontinuity. For the first time, we systematically corrected this known day0-type discontinuity at 378 stations (17 %) in China, resulting in an SSD series with comparable frequencies of zero value before and after 2019. On this base, we constructed a homogenization procedure to detect and adjust discontinuities in both the variance and mean of daily SSD from 1961 to 2022. Results show that a total of 1,363 (60 %) stations experienced breakpoints in SSD, of which ~65 % were confirmed by station relocations and instrument replacements. Compared to the raw SSD, the homogenized SSD is more continuous to the naked eye for various periods, and presents weakened dimming across China from 1961 to 1990 but a non-significant positive trend by a reduction of 60 % in the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that the homogenized SSD tends to better capture the dimming phenomenon. The northern regions continue dimming from 1991 to 2022 but the southern regions of China brighten slightly. The implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control since 2013 has contributed to a reversal of SSD trend thereafter, which is better reflected in the homogenized SSD with a trend shift from -0.02 to 0.07 hours·day-1/decade from 2013 to 2022 in China, especially in heavily polluted regions. Besides, the relationships of cloud cover fraction and aerosol optical depth with SSD are intensified in the homogenized dataset. These results highlight the importance of the homogenized SSD in accurately understanding the dimming and brightening phenomena. The homogenized SSD dataset is publicly available for community use at https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301478 (He et al., 2024)."

(2011) version 1.0,"The Next-generation Emissions InVentory expansion of Akagi (NEIVA) v.1.0 is a comprehensive biomass burning emissions database that allows integration of new data and flexible querying. Data are stored in connected datasets, including recommended averages of ~1500 constituents for 14 globally relevant fire types. Individual compounds were mapped to common model species to allow better attribution of emissions in modeling studies that predict the effects of fires on air quality and climate. 
 Accurate representation of fire emissions is critical for modeling the in-plume, near-source, and remote effects of biomass burning (BB) on atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate. In recent years application of advanced instrumentation has significantly improved knowledge of the compounds emitted from fires, which, coupled with a large number of recent laboratory and field campaigns, has facilitated the emergence of new emission factor (EF) compilations. The Next-generation Emissions InVentory expansion of Akagi (NEIVA) version 1.0 is one such compilation in which the EFs for 14 globally relevant fuel and fire types have been updated to include data from recent studies, with a focus on gaseous non-methane organic compounds (NMOC_g). The data are stored in a series of connected tables that facilitate flexible querying from the individual study level to recommended averages of all laboratory and field data by fire type. The querying features are enabled by assignment of unique identifiers to all compounds and constituents, including thousands of NMOC_g. NEIVA also includes chemical and physical property data and model surrogate assignments for three widely used chemical mechanisms for each NMOC_g. NEIVA EF datasets are compared with recent publications and other EF compilations at the individual compound level and in the context of overall volatility distributions and hydroxyl (OH) reactivity (OHR) estimates. The NMOC_g in NEIVA include ∼4–8 times more compounds with improved representation of intermediate volatility organic compounds, resulting in much lower overall volatility (lowest-volatility bin shifted by as much as 3 orders of magnitude) and significantly higher OHR (up to 90 %) than other compilations. These updates can strongly impact model predictions of the effects of BB on atmospheric composition and chemistry."

The approach is used to generate highly disaggregated vehicle emissions information by vehicle type, which compares well with traditional vehicle emission remote sensing.

The technique is flexible enough to consider a wide range of air pollutants and be deployed at roadside ambient monitoring locations. The new approach is used to quantify emissions and concentration source apportionment for ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). We find that emissions of NH3 are generally very well controlled from diesel vehicles including those with selective catalytic reduction systems that use NH3 to reduce emissions of NOx. By contrast, gasoline passenger cars are shown to be the dominant contributor to NH3 emissions, which increase with vehicle mileage. Average fuel-specific NH3 emission factors for gasoline vehicles range from 0.3 to 1.2 g kg–1, while diesel vehicle emission factors remain below 0.06 g kg–1, with the exception of Euro VI buses with the latest regulatory provisions (0.5 g kg–1)."

Bell,Estimation of the Volatility and Apparent Activity Coefficient of Levoglucosan in Wood-Burning Organic Aerosols,"Biomass burning (BB) is a major source of aerosols and black carbon, thereby exerting an important impact on climate and air quality. Levoglucosan is the most well-recognized organic marker compound of BB and has been used to quantitatively assess BB’s contribution to ambient aerosols. However, little is known about levoglucosan’s evaporation under atmospheric conditions, primarily due to the uncertainty of its effective saturation vapor concentration (C*) and its unknown activity coefficient (γ), in the complex BB emission matrix. Here, we utilized a thermodenuder to investigate the evaporation of levoglucosan from mixtures with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or BB primary organic aerosol (BBPOA) matrices, respectively. We estimate a pure component log10(C*/[μg m–3]) of levoglucosan of 1.1 ± 0.1 at 298 K. We reveal that levoglucosan mixed with PEG or BBPOA becomes more volatile than when treated as a single component due to nonideal molecular interactions. Considering that phase separation might occur in such systems, we term γ apparent activity coefficient (γa). We estimate  log10C* and γa of levoglucosan in BBPOA of 1.8 ± 0.1 and 3.8 ± 0.3, assuming a liquid phase state. Consequently, γa must be considered to avoid significant underestimation of levoglucosan evaporation via gas–particle partitioning during transport."

Peripheral subsidence associated with cyclones can warm an area to varying degrees, depending on the cyclone's strength and position. Meanwhile, the peripheral airflow also overwhelmed the land‐sea breeze circulation system in coastal cities and favored downwind urbanized heat advection on the Southern China coastline. Here, we systematically applied ERA5 global reanalysis data, local surface‐level observations, MODIS‐based land‐cover data and HYSPLIT backward trajectories to evaluate how the position of distant TCs may divert the monsoon system and foster the surface heat advection from upwind urban agglomerate amplifying air temperature in downwind coastline. The analysis suggests when a distant TC is situated in a favorable area (the vicinity of Taiwan and Luzon Strait) at roughly 500–1,250 km to the east of Hong Kong, it forms a unique meteorological condition which allows the surface heat transport from the Greater Bay Area to Hong Kong, reflecting that regional build‐up of heat could be an important mechanism for producing local heat extremes."

Much of the peatland in Indonesia has been deforested and drained, meaning it is more susceptible to fires, especially during drought and El Niño events. Fires are most common in Riau (Sumatra) and Central Kalimantan (Borneo) and lead to poor regional air quality. Measurements of air pollutant concentrations are sparse in both regions contributing to large uncertainties in both fire emissions and air quality degradation. We deployed a network of 13 low‐cost PM2.5 sensors across urban and rural locations in Central Kalimantan and measured indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations during the onset of an El Niño dry season in 2023. During the dry season (September 1st to October 31st), mean outdoor PM2.5 concentrations were 136 μg m−3, with fires contributing 90 μg m−3 to concentrations. Median indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios were 1.01 in rural areas, considerably higher than those reported during wildfires in other regions of the world (e.g., USA), indicating housing stock in the region provides little protection from outdoor PM2.5. We combined WRF‐Chem simulated PM2.5 concentrations with the median fire‐derived I/O ratio and questionnaire results pertaining to participants' time spent I/O to estimate 1.62 million people in Central Kalimantan were exposed to unhealthy, very unhealthy and dangerous air quality (>55.4 μg m−3) during the dry season.

 Poleward water vapor transport in the midlatitudes mainly occurs in meandering filaments of intense water vapor transport, spanning thousands of kilometers long and hundreds of kilometers wide and moving eastward. The water vapor filaments are known as atmospheric rivers (ARs). They can cause extreme wind gusts, intense precipitation, and flooding along densely populated coastal regions. Many recent studies about ARs focused on the statistical analyses of ARs, but a process-level understanding of ARs remains elusive. Here we show that ARs are streams of air with enhanced vapor kinetic energy (VKE) and derive a governing equation for Integrated VKE to understand what contributes to the evolution of ARs. We find that ARs grow mainly because of potential energy conversion to kinetic energy, decay largely owing to condensation and turbulence, and the eastward movement is primarily due to horizontal advection of VKE. Our VKE framework complements the integrated vapor transport framework, which is popular for identifying ARs but lacks a prognostic equation for understanding the physical processes. A vapor kinetic energy analysis shows that atmospheric rivers’ strong winds result from the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy, and their eastward movement is primarily driven by the horizontal transport of water vapor and kinetic energy."

We compare the Kherson region, a battlefield occupied by the Russian army in 2022 with the Poltava region which was not invaded. We also compare the wheat biomass in both regions in 2022 with the two previous years before the war. We find that the wheat biomass sharply declined in the Kherson region in 2022 only. We interpret this result as a consequence of the abandonment of invaded land by farmers. The lack of agricultural management, in particular the lack of fertilization and irrigation could explain the reduced crop growth in summer, thereby contributing to shortages in the wheat production chain."

We used column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2), methane (XCH4), and carbon monoxide (XCO) from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite-2 (GOSAT-2), a unique satellite that observes them simultaneously with the same field of view, to derive the enhancement ratios (ΔXCO/ΔXCO2, ΔXCO/ΔXCH4, and ΔXCH4/ΔXCO2) for the 40 most populous cities in the world. These enhancement ratios were used to evaluate the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). For cities where the difference in the 2015 EDGAR CO emissions between the latest versions (v6.1 and v5.0) was 30% or less, the GOSAT-2 ΔXCO/ΔXCO2 ratios and EDGAR (v6.1/v7.0) CO/CO2 emission ratios were in good agreement (correlation coefficient of 0.65). For ∼70% of the cities where the difference of CO emissions exceeded 30%, the EDGAR CO/CO2 emission ratios using v6.1 CO emissions were in better agreement with the GOSAT-2 ΔXCO/ΔXCO2 ratios than those using v5.0 CO emissions, indicating that v6.1 CO emissions were improved over v5.0 emissions. However, for the remaining cities, the version upgrade may have reduced the CO emissions too much. The CH4 and CO emissions for each city were then estimated from the ΔXCH4/ΔXCO2 and ΔXCO/ΔXCO2 ratios, respectively, by reference to the CO2 emissions from the Open-data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC) or EDGAR. Compared to our estimates using the ODIAC (EDGAR) CO2 emissions, the EDGAR v7.0 CH4 and v6.1 CO emissions were underestimated for 74% (57%) and 76% (53%), respectively, of all cities where results were available. For several cities where emissions were estimated using in situ observations and ground-based remote sensing observations, our results were in reasonable agreement with these results. The implication is that satellite-derived enhancement ratios can provide informative constraints on anthropogenic emissions in megacities."

We also investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the ozone formation regime in relation to ozone chemical sources and sinks. Our analysis is based on remote sensing products of the tropospheric column of ozone and its precursors, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and total column CO, as well as ozonesonde data and model simulations. 
 Tropospheric ozone results from in situ chemical formation and stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE), with the latter being more important in the middle and upper troposphere than in the lower troposphere. Ozone photochemical formation is nonlinear and results from the oxidation of methane and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) in the presence of nitrogen oxide (NOx=NO+NO2). Previous studies showed that O3 short- and long-term trends are nonlinearly controlled by near-surface anthropogenic emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and nitrogen oxides, which may also be impacted by the long-range transport (LRT) of O3 and its precursors. In addition, several studies have demonstrated the important role of STE in enhancing ozone levels, especially in the midlatitudes. In this article, we investigate tropospheric ozone spatial variability and trends from 2005 to 2019 and relate those to ozone precursors on global and regional scales. We also investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the ozone formation regime in relation to ozone chemical sources and sinks. Our analysis is based on remote sensing products of the tropospheric column of ozone (TrC-O3) and its precursors, nitrogen dioxide (TrC-NO2), formaldehyde (TrC-HCHO), and total column  CO (TC-CO), as well as ozonesonde data and model simulations. Our results indicate a complex relationship between tropospheric ozone column levels, surface ozone levels, and ozone precursors. While the increasing trends of near-surface ozone concentrations can largely be explained by variations in VOC and NOx concentration under different regimes, TrC-O3 may also be affected by other variables such as tropopause height and STE as well as LRT. Decreasing or increasing trends in TrC-NO2 have varying effects on  TrC-O3, which is related to the different local chemistry in each region. We also shed light on the contribution of NOx lightning and soil NO and nitrous acid (HONO) emissions to trends of tropospheric ozone on regional and global scales."
10.5194/amt-17-6369-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文评估了地球静止环境监测光谱仪(GEMS)反演的乙二醛(glyoxal)产品。GEMS是搭载在GEO-KOMPSAT-2B卫星上的首个地球静止环境监测卫星，具有独特的小时级观测能力。研究通过将GEMS的乙二醛垂直柱浓度(VCD)产品与TROPOMI卫星数据和地面MAX-DOAS观测数据进行比较，评估了其精度和可靠性。结果表明，GEMS和TROPOMI的乙二醛空间分布总体相似，但在月变化上存在差异，尤其是在东亚地区。研究认为，污染的参考光谱和高浓度的二氧化氮(NO2)是造成这种差异的主要原因。通过对NO2进行校正，可以提高GEMS乙二醛VCD数据的精度。此外，GEMS与MAX-DOAS的地面观测结果在小时尺度上显示出相似的日变化趋势，尤其是在日本的一些站点。总的来说，这项研究验证了GEMS在监测大气乙二醛，进而研究挥发性有机物(VOCs)排放和日变化方面的潜力。,"['glyoxal', 'air quality', 'satellite remote sensing', 'GEMS', 'TROPOMI', 'MAX-DOAS', 'NO2', 'VOCs', 'atmospheric composition', 'geostationary satellite', 'vertical column density (VCD)', 'diurnal variation']",Eunjo S.

GEMS and TROPOMI VCDs present similar spatial distributions. Monthly variations in GEMS VCDs and TROPOMI and MAX-DOAS VCDs differ in northeastern Asia, which we attributed to a polluted reference spectrum and high NO2 concentrations. GEMS glyoxal products with unparalleled temporal resolution would enrich our understanding of VOC emissions and diurnal variation. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) on board the GEO-KOMPSAT-2B satellite is the first geostationary satellite launched to monitor the environment. GEMS conducts hourly measurements during the day over eastern and southeastern Asia. This work presents glyoxal (CHOCHO) vertical column densities (VCDs) retrieved from GEMS, with optimal settings for glyoxal retrieval based on sensitivity tests involving reference spectrum sampling and fitting window selection. We evaluated GEMS glyoxal VCDs by comparing them to the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) ground-based observations. On average, GEMS and TROPOMI VCDs show a spatial correlation coefficient of 0.63, increasing to 0.87 for northeastern Asia. While GEMS and TROPOMI demonstrate similar monthly variations in the Indochinese Peninsula regions (R > 0.67), variations differ in other areas. Specifically, GEMS VCDs are higher in the winter and either lower or comparable to TROPOMI and MAX-DOAS VCDs in the summer across northeastern Asia. We attributed the discrepancies in the monthly variation to a polluted reference spectrum and high NO2 concentrations. When we correct GEMS glyoxal VCDs as a function of NO2 SCDs, the monthly correlation coefficients substantially increase from 0.16–0.40 to 0.45–0.72 in high NO2 regions. When averaged hourly, GEMS and MAX-DOAS VCDs exhibit similar diurnal variations, especially at stations in Japan (Chiba, Kasuga, and Fukue)."
10.5194/essd-16-5089-2024,True,Earth System Science Data,这篇论文研究了2015年至2021年间法国13个城市地区的亚微米气溶胶的化学成分。使用了气溶胶化学形态监测仪（ACSM）和多波长烟尘仪（AE33）进行长期、准连续的测量，获得了亚微米颗粒物（PM1）主要化学成分（有机气溶胶、硝酸盐、铵盐、硫酸盐、非海盐氯化物和等效黑碳）的质量浓度数据。研究分析了不同地区、季节和昼夜的气溶胶化学成分差异，发现有机气溶胶是PM1的主要成分，其次是硝酸盐，硫酸盐和黑碳的贡献相对较小。论文还将测量结果与CHIMERE化学传输模型进行了比较，发现模型对有机气溶胶的浓度存在低估。这项研究对于改进空气质量模型、制定空气污染减排策略以及进行流行病学分析具有重要意义。它属于地面观测，利用仪器直接测量气溶胶的化学成分，与卫星遥感技术没有直接关系，但数据可以用于验证和改进大气化学模型，这些模型可以结合卫星遥感数据进行更广泛的应用。,"['Air quality monitoring', 'Aerosol chemical composition', 'PM1', 'Organic aerosols', 'Nitrate', 'Sulfate', 'Black carbon', 'Ground-based measurements', 'Chemical transport model']",Hasna Chebaicheb;Joel F. de Brito;Tanguy Amodeo;Florian Couvidat;Jean-Eudes Petit;Emmanuel Tison;Gregory Abbou;Alexia Baudic;Mélodie Chatain;Benjamin Chazeau;Nicolas Marchand;Raphaële Falhun;Florie Francony;Cyril Ratier;Didier Grenier;Romain Vidaud;Shouwen Zhang;Gregory Gille;Laurent Meunier;Caroline Marchand;Véronique Riffault;Olivier Favez,Multiyear high-temporal-resolution measurements of submicron aerosols at 13 French urban sites: data processing and chemical composition,"Long-term (2015–2021) quasi-continuous measurements have been obtained at 13 French urban sites using online mass spectrometry, to acquire the comprehensive chemical composition of submicron particulate matter. The results show their spatial and temporal differences and confirm the predominance of organics in France (40–60 %). These measurements can be used for many future studies, such as trend and epidemiological analyses, or comparisons with chemical transport models. 
 This paper presents a first comprehensive analysis of long-term measurements of atmospheric aerosol components from aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and multiwavelength Aethalometer (AE33) instruments collected between 2015 and 2021 at 13 (sub)urban sites as part of the French CARA (Chemical Characterization of Particles) program. The datasets contain the mass concentrations of major chemical species within submicron aerosols (PM1), namely organic aerosols (OAs), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), sulfate (SO42-), non-sea-salt chloride (Cl−), and equivalent black carbon (eBC). Rigorous quality control, technical validation, and environmental evaluation processes were applied, adhering to both guidance from the French Reference Laboratory for Air Quality Monitoring (LCSQA) and the Aerosol, Clouds, and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS) standard operating procedures. Key findings include geographical differences in the aerosol chemical composition, seasonal variations, and diel patterns, which are influenced by meteorological conditions, anthropogenic activities, and proximity to emission sources. Overall, OA dominates PM1 at each site (43 %–60 % of total mass), showing distinct seasonality with higher concentrations (i) in winter, due to enhanced residential heating emissions, and (ii) in summer, due to increased photochemistry favoring secondary aerosol formation. NO3 is the second most important contributor to PM1 (15 %–30 %), peaking in late winter and early spring, especially in northern France, and playing a significant role during pollution episodes. SO4 (8 %–14 %) and eBC (5 %–11 %) complement the major fine-aerosol species, with their relative contributions strongly influenced by the origin of air masses and the stability of meteorological conditions, respectively.A comparison with the 3D chemical transport model (CTM) CHIMERE shows high correlations between simulations and measurements, albeit with an OA concentration underestimation of 46 %–76 %. Regional discrepancies in NO3 concentration levels emphasize the importance of these datasets with respect to validating air quality models and tailoring air pollution mitigation strategies.

10.5194/gmd-17-7713-2024,True,Geoscientific Model Development,这篇论文介绍了全球森林火灾排放预测系统（GFFEPS）模型。该模型使用自下而上的方法，结合遥感热点数据、全球数据库以及加拿大森林火灾危险等级系统，动态估计燃料消耗、火灾行为和火灾增长，从而预测碳排放和烟雾排放。与其他全球模型不同，GFFEPS 使用每日天气条件来捕捉每日变化的燃烧条件，这使得其碳排放量预测结果低于其他模型。论文中将GFFEPS与GFAS、GFED4.1s和FINN等其他全球野火排放模型进行了比较，并评估了其在2015-2020年期间的性能。GFFEPS利用VIIRS卫星探测到的热点数据，进行大气成分分析，特别是碳排放和烟雾排放的分析，对空气质量预测具有重要意义。研究结果表明，GFFEPS能够区分不同植被类型（如草原和森林）的燃料消耗，并能体现厄尔尼诺现象和森林砍伐的影响。总的来说，这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测数据（VIIRS）来预测火灾排放，并为空气质量监测和大气成分分析提供信息。,"['carbon emissions', 'smoke emissions', 'air quality forecasting', 'satellite observations', 'VIIRS', 'wildland fires', 'atmospheric composition', 'fire detection', 'emission prediction']",Kerry Anderson;Jack Chen;Peter Englefield;Debora Griffin;Paul A. Makar;Dan Thompson,The Global Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System version 1.0,"The Global Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (GFFEPS) is a model that predicts smoke and carbon emissions from wildland fires. The model calculates emissions from the ground up based on satellite-detected fires, modelled weather and fire characteristics. Unlike other global models, GFFEPS uses daily weather conditions to capture changing burning conditions on a day-to-day basis. GFFEPS produced lower carbon emissions due to the changing weather not captured by the other models. 
 The Global Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (GFFEPS) is a model that estimates biomass burning in near-real time for global air quality forecasting. The model uses a bottom-up approach, based on remotely sensed hotspot locations, and global databases linking burned area per hotspot to ecosystem-type classification at a 1 km resolution. Unlike other global fire emissions models, GFFEPS provides dynamic estimates of fuel consumption, fire behaviour and fire growth based on the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, plant phenology as calculated from daily global weather and burned-area estimates using near-real-time Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite-detected hotspots and historical burned-area statistics. Combining forecasts of daily fire weather and hourly meteorological conditions with a global land classification, GFFEPS produces fuel consumption and emission predictions in 3 h time steps (in contrast to non-dynamic models that use fixed consumption rates and require a collection of burned area to make post-burn estimates of emissions). GFFEPS has been designed for use in operational forecasting applications as well as historical simulations for which data are available. A study was conducted showing GFFEPS predictions through a 6-year period (2015–2020). Regional annual total smoke emissions, burned area and total fuel consumption per unit area as predicted by GFFEPS were generated to assess model performance over multiple years and regions. The model's fuel consumption per unit area results clearly distinguished regions dominated by grassland (Africa) from those dominated by forests (boreal regions) and showed high variability in regions affected by El Niño and deforestation. GFFEPS carbon emissions and burned area were then compared to other global wildfire emissions models, including the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS), the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4.1s) and the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN 1.5 and 2.5). GFFEPS estimated values lower than GFAS and GFED (80 % and 74 %) and had values similar to FINN 1.5 (97 %). This was largely due to the impact of fuel moisture on consumption rates as captured by the dynamic weather modelling. Model evaluation efforts to date are described – an ongoing effort is underway to further validate the model, with further developments and improvements expected in the future."

As wildfire activity increases with climate change, its growing continental influence necessitates multidisciplinary research to examine smoke’s evolving chemical composition far downwind and connect chemical composition-based source apportionment to potential health effects. Leveraging advanced real-time speciated PM2.5 measurements, including an aerosol chemical speciation monitor in conjunction with source apportionment and health risk assessments, we quantified the stark pollution enhancements during peak Canadian wildfire smoke transport to New York City over June 6–9, 2023. Interestingly, we also observed lower-intensity, but frequent, multiday wildfire smoke episodes during May–June 2023, which risk exposure misclassification as generic aged organic PM2.5 via aerosol mass spectrometry given its extensive chemical transformations during 1 to 6+ days of transport. Total smoke-related organic PM2.5 showed significant associations with asthma exacerbations, and estimates of in-lung oxidative stress were enhanced with chemical aging, collectively demonstrating elevated health risks with increasingly frequent smoke episodes. These results show that avoiding underestimated aged biomass burning PM2.5 contributions, especially outside of peak episodes, necessitates real-time chemically resolved PM2.5 monitoring to enable next-generation health studies, models, and policy under far-reaching wildfire impacts in the 21st century."

However, there is an absence of measurement-based assessment of methane emissions from NG consumption, including those from the urban distribution network. Here, we conducted a mobile survey with concurrent measurements of ambient methane concentrations, carbon dioxide concentrations, and 13CH4 isotopic signatures in the center and suburban areas of Hangzhou, a megacity in East China, from November 2021 to June 2022. We detected 176 leak indications in the 1408 km road covered with 32% attributed to NG leaks based on the source isotopic signature and the methane-to-carbon dioxide ratio derived from the Keeling plot and measured concentrations. We quantified the flux using Weller’s empirical equation, which yielded an emission factor of 115 L·d–1·km–1 in Hangzhou. The value ranges from 16 to 314 L·d–1·km–1 by accounting for various uncertainty sources. This emission factor falls on the lower end compared to previous studies conducted in North American and European cities. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of mobile surveys in detecting methane emission sources in urban China."

The re‐constructed results were able to delineate diverse vegetation conditions undetectable from the original 25‐km VOD record, and showed overall favorable correspondence with in situ plant water potential measurements (R from 0.60 to 0.78). The VOD water potential estimates effectively tracked plant water storage changes from hydro‐climate variability over diverse sub‐regions.

Previous projections have suggested a delay, but the extent of this delay remains uncertain, undermining the reliability of the projections. Here, we show a significant correlation between the projected shift in Bay of Bengal/South China Sea monsoon onset and present‐day sea surface temperature (SST) simulation over the western Pacific (WP). This emergent relationship arises from the spread of the precipitation response over the western‐central Pacific to WP SST, as more precipitation induces stronger tropical upper‐tropospheric warming, increasing westerly vertical shear near South Asia, and facilitating the onset delay. The rectified projections indicate that the delayed shift is almost halved compared to raw projections, and the intermodel uncertainty is reduced by 30%."

The cooling patterns follow the upward propagating water vapor (H2O) anomalies from Hunga, and similar behavior is found between observations and model simulations. While the stratospheric cooling is mainly due to radiative cooling from enhanced H2O, the mesospheric temperature changes result from ozone losses in the mesosphere, which are in‐turn driven by HOx radicals from Hunga H2O. Comparisons with the multi‐decade climate record show that Hunga impacts on stratospheric temperatures have similar magnitude, but opposite sign, to temperature effects from the large El Chichón (1982) and Pinatubo (1991) volcanic eruptions."

Previous studies have indicated that forest greening can impact the local climate by modifying the seasonal surface energy budget. However, the understanding of tree phenological responses to forest greening at large spatial scales remains limited. Utilizing satellite‐derived phenological and leaf area index data spanning from 2001 to 2021, herein we show that forest greening led to earlier spring and autumn phenology in both temperate and boreal forests. Our findings demonstrated that forest greening during winter and spring contributed to a reduction in surface albedo, resulting in biophysical warming and consequently advancing spring leaf phenology. Conversely, forest greening in summer and autumn induced biophysical cooling through increased evapotranspiration, leading to an earlier onset of autumn leaf phenology. Our findings highlight the significant impact of forest greening‐induced local seasonal climate changes on shaping tree phenology in temperate and boreal forests. It is crucial to consider these greening‐induced alterations in microclimate conditions when modeling changes in tree phenology under future climate warming scenarios."

 Tropical convection plays a critical role in modulating the global climate by influencing climate variability. However, its future projection under climate mitigation scenarios remains uncertain. Here, we found that while the relationship between precipitation intensity and upward motion remains constant regardless of changing CO2 concentrations, the sea surface temperature threshold for tropical convection and the convective zone exhibit hysteretic and irreversible behavior. As the CO2 concentration decreases from its peak (ramp-down), higher tropical ocean temperature leads to higher sea surface temperature thresholds for convection than during the period of increasing CO2 concentration (ramp-up), while convective instability remains the same during both ramp-up and ramp-down. El Niño-like warming during the ramp-down leads to a weakening of the Walker circulation and an expansion of the convective zone in the central to eastern tropical Pacific by a warmer-get-wetter mechanism. Our results suggest that CO2 removal does not guarantee the recovery of tropical convection. The sea surface temperature threshold for tropical convection and convective zones shows irreversible behavior, suggesting that mitigation efforts may not fully offset tropical convective activities, according to results from different climate mitigation scenarios to analyze tropical convection and its physical mechanisms."

 Frequent occurrences of widespread winter haze over Northern India largely appear to originate from exceedingly high concentrations of fine particulate matter from anthropogenic emissions. However, the underlying mechanisms driving winter haze in Northern India are not well understood. This study employed a synergy of satellite and reanalysis data from 2006 to 2021 to assess the role of hygroscopic growth of aerosol optical depth in winter haze over the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain. A method has been developed to extract dry aerosol optical depth from ambient aerosol optical depth to elucidate the origin of winter haze. About 31% of severe haze episodes (aerosol optical depth > 0.85) occurring under ambient humidity conditions decrease to below 5% for dry conditions, indicating the critical role of particle hygroscopic growth. The change in radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere due to hygroscopic growth is relatively small compared to that at the surface and in the atmosphere, indicating enhanced atmospheric warming. The ubiquitous winter haze over the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain is exacerbated by hygroscopic growth under high anthropogenic aerosol emissions, further aggravated through aerosol-radiation feedback. These results will be valuable in devising haze forecasts, implementing effective mitigation policies, and representing aerosol hygroscopicity in climate models.

 Ozone (O3) pollution, which not only depends on emissions but is also closely related to prevailing meteorological conditions, is a major concern in China. In the context of China's emission controls imposed during the 13th Five-Year Plan, the variations of synoptic circulations and associated summertime O3 variations were investigated during 2016–2020. Different from the common use in previous studies of observations and numerical models, a regional atmospheric composition reanalysis dataset at a refined spatial (45 km) and temporal (1 h) resolution was applied here, in which O3 and its major precursors, emissions, and meteorology were jointly assimilated to reduce the impacts of uncertainty. With this continuous and optimal dataset, the impacts of regional synoptic variations on O3 interannual variability were explored through an objective circulation classification approach during 2016–2020 over China. On the one hand, from the perspective of O3 variability, increasing trends of O3 levels were detected. Compared to the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), and Sichuan Basin (SCB) with less summer pollution, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) and Fenwei Plain (FWP) regions had more severe summer O3 pollution with the frequency of days exceeding Grade 3 tends to be around 50%. On the other hand, from the perspective of O3 variability driven by meteorological conditions, obvious interannual variations of synoptic circulation patterns occurred, and about half of type C occurrences were accompanied by O3 pollution episodes in BTH and FWP (i.e., 52.73% and 45.65%), while far fewer pollution episodes occurred with type C in YRD and PRD (i.e., 2.78% and 0.59%). In addition, according to the quantitative assessment of the meteorological contribution, the contribution of interannual variations of synoptic circulations to changing the O3 variability amounted to 13%–31% in BTH, YRD, PRD, FWP, and SCB. Therefore, the interannual variability of O3 from 2016 to 2020 over China was closely linked with the regulations of O3 precursors. This work provides an understanding of O3 variation under the impacts of emission regulations and meteorological conditions over China."

Wong;Jianmin Chen,Ground ozone rise during the 2022 shanghai lockdown caused by the unfavorable emission reduction ratio of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds,"•Ineffective VOC and NOx reduction ratios play an important role in elevating O3. •Enhanced focus on active VOCs emission control is essential for mitigating O3pollution. •Collaborative regional prevention is imperative for reducing O3pollution. 
 Ground-level ozone (O3) pollution has shifted from a scientific issue to a key focus of governmental action in China. In recent years, the concentration of NO2 in Shanghai has shown a decreasing trend of 3.7% annually, but ozone concentrations have exhibited significant interannual variability, particularly with a noticeable increase in 2022. This study focuses on investigating the mechanisms behind the increase in ozone concentration during the COVID-19 pandemic control period in 2022 in Shanghai, utilizing a combination of ground observation data, observation-based models, and chemical transport models for analysis. The results indicate that during the lockdown period, the mean values of daily maximum 8-h average O3 concentrations (MDA8 O3) in Shanghai increased by 17 μg/m³, with emission-related factors contributing 65.3%, primarily due to a blanket reduction in VOCs and NOx emissions during the lockdown, with a reduction ratio close to 1:1. However, this reduction ratio and intensity are not sufficiently reasonable to alleviate ozone pollution. Meanwhile, adverse meteorological conditions further exacerbated this effect, contributing 34.7%, with temperature rise having the greatest impact. Results from the chemical transport model show that with the total reduction in NOx and VOCs emissions unchanged, the greater the reduction in VOC emissions and the better the reduction effect on ozone pollution, reducing MDA8 O3 by approximately 10 μg/m³, especially for the control of reactive compounds such as alkenes, aromatics, and OVOCs. However, if the reduction ratio of NOx is greater than that of VOCs, ozone concentrations may not decrease but instead increase. This indicates that ozone concentration is influenced not only by the intensity of emissions reduction but also by the ratio of emissions reduction between NOx and VOCs. Our study emphasizes the critical role of carefully designed strategies, focusing on controlling the ratio of VOCs to NOx and increasing the intensity of VOCs reduction, to effectively alleviate ozone pollution in urban areas."

 Fog is a widespread phenomenon in the coastal Atacama Desert. Within this region, three types of fog have been described: advective, orographic, and radiative. However, there remains a lack of quantification regarding their frequencies, the physical mechanisms responsible for their formation, and their contribution to fog water collection. Our research quantifies for the first time in the Atacama Desert the frequency of each fog type, the physical conditions conducive to their formation, and their potential for water collection. Using high temporal resolution (10 min) GOES satellite imagery, we define geographical criteria related to the regular area of presence of different types of fogs that allowed us to analyze their frequencies at multiple time scales. Our results reveal that advective fog accounts for ∼76 % of total fog events, with orographic fog ∼22 % and radiative fog ∼2 %. The main physical mechanisms driving advective and orographic fog formation are the sea surface temperature and the thermal inversion layer, whereas for radiative fog formation, it is mainly controlled by the marine boundary layer height. On a monthly scale, advective fog contributes to 60 % of water collection, while orographic fog accounts for 40 %. At the diurnal scale, orographic fog has a higher collection rate per hour. This inversion is influenced by local-scale variables such as wind speed, which plays a crucial role in water collection on a diurnal scale, enhancing orographic fog formation and its relative contribution during afternoon hours. Our research enhances the understanding of fog as a spatial-meteorological phenomenon and a potential water resource, offering a straightforward methodology for classifying fog types in coastal arid regions worldwide."

We performed a comprehensive study with laboratory measurements cooking 19 different dishes and ambient measurements at two Christmas markets measuring various particle properties and trace gases of emissions in real time. Similar emission characteristics were observed for dishes with the same preparation method, mainly due to similar cooking temperature and use of oil, with barbecuing as an especially strong source. 
 Since most people, especially in developed countries, spend most of their time indoors, they are heavily exposed to indoor aerosols, which can potentially lead to adverse health effects. A major source of indoor aerosols are cooking activities, which release large quantities of particulate emissions (in terms of both number and mass), often with complex compositions. To investigate the characteristics of cooking emissions and what influences these emissions, we conducted a comprehensive study by cooking 19 dishes with different ingredients and cooking methods. The emissions were monitored in real time with several online instruments that measured both physical and chemical particle properties as well as trace gas concentrations. The same instrumentation was used to study the influence of cooking emissions on the ambient aerosol load at two German Christmas markets. In contrast to previous studies, which often focus on individual aspects or emission variables, this broad and coherent approach allows a comparison of the influence of different parameters (e.g., ingredients, cooking method, cooking temperature, cooking activities) on the emissions.We found an influence of cooking emissions on six variables: number concentration of smaller (particle diameter dp > 5 nm) and larger (dp > 250 nm) particles, particulate matter (PM: PM1, PM2.5, PM10), black carbon (BC), PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), and organic aerosol mass concentration. In general, similar emission characteristics were observed for dishes with the same cooking method, mainly due to similar cooking temperature and use of oil. The temporal dynamics in the emissions of the aforementioned variables, as well as the sizes of the emitted particles, were mainly influenced by the cooking temperature and the activities during cooking. Emissions were quantified using emission factors, with the highest values for grilled dishes, 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower for oil-based cooking (baking, stir-frying, deep-frying), and the lowest for boiled dishes.For the identification of cooking emissions with the Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), and more generally for the identification of new AMS markers for individual organic aerosol types, we propose a new plot type that takes into account the mass spectral variability for individual aerosol types. Combining our results and those of previous studies for the quantification of cooking-related organic aerosols with the AMS, we recommend the use of relative ionization efficiency values higher than the default value for organics (RIEOrg = 1.4): 2.17 ± 0.48 for rapeseed-oil-based cooking and 5.16 ± 0.77 for soybean-oil-based cooking."

Results show that using CRIs obtained by advanced realistic techniques can improve the accuracy of these measurements, emphasizing the importance of choosing the suitable CRI in atmospheric models. This improvement is crucial for better predicting the dust radiative effect and impact on the climate. 
 Mineral dust significantly influences the Earth's climate system by affecting the radiative balance through the emission, absorption and scattering of solar and terrestrial radiation. Estimating the dust radiative effect remains challenging due to the lack of detailed information on the physical and chemical properties of dust. High-spectral-resolution instruments in the infrared (IR) spectrum, such as the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Instrument (IASI), have demonstrated the ability to quantify these aerosol properties. A crucial parameter for characterizing mineral dust from space is the complex refractive index (CRI), as it links the dust's physical and chemical properties to its optical properties.This paper examines the impact of six prior laboratory CRI datasets to improve the characterization of dust microphysical properties using IASI. The CRIs include older measurements obtained through the classical pellet method, commonly employed in mineral dust applications, as well as newer datasets that incorporate the latest advancements in laboratory measurement techniques for aerosol generation. These datasets are tested on IASI measurements during a dust storm event over the Gobi Desert in May 2017. We evaluate the sensitivity of IASI to different CRI datasets using the Atmospheric Radiation Algorithm for High-Spectral Resolution Measurements from Infrared Spectrometer (ARAHMIS) radiative transfer algorithm and explore the datasets' impact on retrieving size distribution parameters by mapping their spatial distributions. The results indicate that the laboratory CRI datasets decrease the total error in the covariance matrix by 30 %. In addition, we assess the ability to accurately reconstruct IASI detections and the extent to which we can retrieve the microphysical properties of dust particles. The choice of CRI significantly impacts the accuracy of dust detection and characterization from satellite observations. Notably, datasets that incorporate recent aerosol generation techniques with higher spectral resolution and samples from the case study region show improved compatibility with IASI observations. The outcomes of this research emphasize two key points: the crucial link between chemical composition of dust and its optical properties and the importance of considering the specific composition of the CRI dataset for improved retrieval of the microphysical parameters. Furthermore, this study highlights the critical role of ongoing enhancements in CRI measurement approaches, as well as the potential of high-spectral-resolution infrared sounders for aerosol atmospheric investigation and for understanding the radiative impacts of sounders."

 Methodologies for identifying atmospheric oxidized mercury (HgII) compounds, including particulate-bound HgII (HgII(p)) and gaseous oxidized mercury (HgII(g)), by mass spectrometry  are currently under development. This method requires preconcentration of HgII for analysis due to high instrument detection limits relative to ambient HgII concentrations. The objective of this work was to identify and test materials for quantitative capture of HgII from the gas phase and to suggest potential surfaces onto which HgII can be collected, thermally desorbed, and characterized using mass spectrometry methods. From the literature, several compounds were identified as potential sorbent materials and tested in the laboratory for uptake of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) and HgII(g) (permeated from a HgBr2 salt source). Chitosan, α-Al2O3, and γ-Al2O3 demonstrated HgII(g) capture in ambient air laboratory tests, without sorbing Hg0 under the same conditions. When compared to cation exchange membranes (CEMs), chitosan captured a comparable quantity of HgII(g), while ≤90 % of loaded HgII(g) was recovered from α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3. When deployed in the field, the capture efficiency of chitosan decreased compared to CEMs, indicating that environmental conditions impacted the sorption efficiency of this material. The poor recovery of HgII from the tested materials compared to CEMs in the field indicates that further identification and exploration of alternative sorbent materials are required to advance atmospheric mercury chemistry analysis by mass spectrometry methods."

A two-stage quality control (QC) method is proposed. In stage 1, gross errors are screened out. In stage 2, some random errors, systematic errors, and micro meteorological errors are filtered out. After QC, errors are reduced. The percentile profiles of 3 variables are more reasonable. The overlap ratio between automatic and manual QC results reaches 86 %. The method reduces the human resource cost, helps unify the QC standards. 
 The balloon-borne radiosonde observations provide high-resolution profile observations of pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and winds from the surface to the middle stratosphere. These observations help validate space-based data and are used in climate research, weather forecasting. For the large amount of second-level radiosonde data, it is tedious and time-consuming for the manual quality control (QC). Furthermore, varying experiences and different judgment standards may lead to inconsistent judgments for abnormal data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage QC method for second-level radiosonde data based on the Bezier curve fitting. In the stage QC1, the gross errors are filtered out according to the measurement range of the sensors, the change rates and extreme temperature values based on pressure segmentations. Also, the algorithm of the longest descending sequence(LDS) is used to identify the moment of sounding termination and eliminate items after that moment. In the stage QC2, we score each item with deviations calculated using Bezier curve fitting, and then use a decision tree model ,CART, to identify anomalies in second-level radiosonde data. The experiment results first demonstrate the efficacy of QC at each step, and finally validate the rationality of our method by comparing the statistical characteristics before and after QC. After QC, the error items are greatly reduced, and the percentile profile distribution of temperature, pressure and relative humidity becomes more reasonable. The overlap of items identified by manual QC and automatic QC reaches 86 %, verifying the effectiveness of our method. This research significantly boosts QC efficiency and unifies the QC standards, providing quality assurance for various applications."

Stubenrauch,Assessment of object-based indices to identify convective organization,"In recent years, several studies focused their attention on the disposition of convection. Lots of methods, called indices, have been developed to quantify the amount of convection clustering. These indices are evaluated in this study by defining criteria that must be satisfied and then evaluating the indices against these standards. None of the indices meet all criteria, with some only partially meeting them. 
 The emerging field of convective organization has attracted significant attention due to its potential implications for weather and climate. Numerous indices have been developed to identify organization of convection, serving as essential tools for advancing our understanding in this area. Because of the large number of these indices, many results on convective organization are still uncertain, and different studies have shown diverging results. The present analysis studies and compares nine object-based indices in order to evaluate their ability to quantify organization. The analysis begins by establishing a set of criteria expected for convective organization and subsequently subjecting the indices to assessment against these benchmarks. The criteria are grouped into three categories. The first category tests the robustness of the indices against noise. The second category evaluates their sensitivity to the size and position of the convective objects. The third category assesses their dependency on the specific characteristics of the dataset in use. Among the indices scrutinized, none fulfill all the desired conditions, and some conditions are only marginally satisfied. Therefore, we developed a new index, called the Organization Index based on Distance and Relative Area (OIDRA), as an example of a well-behaving index. The unmet conditions and differences between indices can explain the discord between different organization studies. The results come down to a guideline that will help to advance our description of deep convective organization."

Dykema;Beiping Luo;Georgios A. Kelesidis;Christian A. Bruun;Timofei Sukhodolov;Frank N. Keutsch;Thomas Peter;Gabriel Chiodo,A fully coupled solid-particle microphysics scheme for stratospheric aerosol injections within the aerosol–chemistry–climate model SOCOL-AERv2,"We quantified impacts and efficiency of stratospheric solar climate intervention via solid particle injection. Microphysical interactions of solid particles with the sulfur cycle were interactively coupled to the heterogeneous chemistry scheme and the radiative transfer code of an aerosol–chemistry–climate model. Compared to injection of SO2 we only find a stronger cooling efficiency for solid particles when normalizing to the aerosol load but not when normalizing to the injection rate. 
 Recent studies have suggested that injection of solid particles such as alumina and calcite particles for stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) instead of sulfur-based injections could reduce some of the adverse side effects of SAI such as ozone depletion and stratospheric heating. Here, we present a version of the global aerosol–chemistry–climate model SOCOL-AERv2 and the Earth system model (ESM) SOCOLv4 which incorporate a solid-particle microphysics scheme for assessment of SAI of solid particles. Microphysical interactions of the solid particle with the stratospheric sulfur cycle were interactively coupled to the heterogeneous chemistry scheme and the radiative transfer code (RTC) for the first time within an ESM. Therefore, the model allows simulation of heterogeneous chemistry at the particle surface as well as feedbacks between microphysics, chemistry, radiation and climate. We show that sulfur-based SAI results in a doubling of the stratospheric aerosol burden compared to the same mass injection rate of calcite and alumina particles with a radius of 240 nm. Most of the sulfuric acid aerosol mass resulting from SO2 injection does not need to be lifted to the stratosphere but is formed after in situ oxidation and subsequent water uptake in the stratosphere. Therefore, to achieve the same radiative forcing, larger injection rates are needed for calcite and alumina particle injection than for sulfur-based SAI. The stratospheric sulfur cycle would be significantly perturbed, with a reduction in stratospheric sulfuric acid burden by 53 %, when injecting 5 Mt yr−1 (megatons per year) of alumina or calcite particles of 240 nm radius. We show that alumina particles will acquire a sulfuric acid coating equivalent to about 10 nm thickness if the sulfuric acid is equally distributed over the whole available particle surface area in the lower stratosphere. However, due to the steep contact angle of sulfuric acid on alumina particles, the sulfuric acid coating would likely not cover the entire alumina surface, which would result in available surface for heterogeneous reactions other than the ones on sulfuric acid. When applying realistic uptake coefficients of 1.0, 10−5 and 10−4 for H2SO4, HCl and HNO3, respectively, the same scenario with injections of calcite particles results in 94 % of the particle mass remaining in the form of CaCO3. This likely keeps the optical properties of the calcite particles intact but could significantly alter the heterogeneous reactions occurring on the particle surfaces. The major process uncertainties of solid-particle SAI are (1) the solid-particle microphysics in the injection plume and degree of agglomeration of solid particles on the sub-ESM grid scale, (2) the scattering properties of the resulting agglomerates, (3) heterogeneous chemistry on the particle surface, and (4) aerosol–cloud interactions. These uncertainties can only be addressed with extensive, coordinated experimental and modelling research efforts. The model presented in this work offers a useful tool for sensitivity studies and incorporating new experimental results on SAI of solid particles."

Are these climate phenomena of the two regions physically connected? If yes, what are the responsible dynamical mechanisms involved? Utilizing the ERA5 reanalysis data and model simulations, this study reveals a significant seesaw variation in the convection and temperature trends between WP and ME. When convective heating intensifies over the WP, the ME tends to be drier and hotter during the spring, and vice versa. A further investigation indicates that the enhanced WP convective heating can induce anticyclonic circulation anomalies in the upper and middle troposphere over the Iranian and Tibetan plateaus. These anomalous high pressures extend westward, exhibiting a barotropic structure, which leads to stronger sinking motions, reduced cloud cover, and increased surface solar radiation over the ME. Consequently, these conditions result in drier and hotter soils and an increase in heatwave days in the ME. This study provides useful information for enhancing our understanding of the role of tropical WP climate change in influencing the upstream climate conditions with a focus on the ME."

We used negative and positive ion electrospray ionization Fourier‐transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT‐ICR MS) to identify differences in the molecular compositions of gas and particle phase samples from urban atmosphere. We aimed to identify intrinsic chemical parameters that determine and predict the organic aerosol volatility. We found higher average molecular weights, carbon mass percentages, and double bond equivalents (DBE) but lower average O/C ratios and oxygen mass percentages in the particle phase than the gas phase. We identified DBE, which display a significant negative correlation with volatility, as a key parameter.

Latitude‐altitude dependent spectra are derived from correlations of interannual H2O anomalies with respect to the tropical tropopause source region, fitted with an inverse Gaussian distribution function. The reconstructions accurately capture interannual H2O variability in the “tropical pipe” and near‐global lower stratosphere, regions of relatively fast transport (∼1–2 years) in the Brewer‐Dobson circulation. The calculations provide novel observational estimates of the corresponding “short transit‐time” part of the age spectrum in these regions, including the mode. However, the H2O results do not constrain the longer transit‐time “tail” of the age spectra, and the mean age of air and spectral widths are systematically underestimated compared to other data. We compare observational results with parallel calculations applied to the WACCM chemistry‐climate model and the CLaMS chemistry‐transport model, and additionally evaluate the method in CLaMS by comparing with spectra from idealized pulse tracers. Because the age spectra accurately capture H2O interannual variations originating from the tropical tropopause, they can be used to identify “other” sources of variability in the lower stratosphere, and we use these calculations to quantify H2O anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere linked to the Australian New Years fires in early 2020 and the Hunga volcanic eruption in 2022."

Rainville,Seasonal and Local Time Variation in the Observed Peak of the Meteor Altitude Distributions by Meteor Radars,"Meteoroids of sub‐milligram sizes burn up high in the Earth's atmosphere and cause streaks of plasma trails detectable by meteor radars. The altitude at which these trails, or meteors, form depends on a number of factors including atmospheric density and the astronomical source populations from which these meteoroids originate. A previous study has shown that the altitude of these meteors is affected by long‐term linear trends and the 11‐year solar cycle related to changes in our atmosphere. In this work, we examine how shorter diurnal and seasonal variations in the altitude distribution of meteors are dependent on the geographical location at which the measurements are performed. We use meteoroid altitude data from 18 independent meteor radar stations at a broad range of latitudes and investigate whether there are local time (LT) and seasonal variations in the altitude of the peak meteor height, defined as the majority detection altitude of all meteors within a certain period, which differ from those expected purely from the variation in the visibility of their astronomical source. We find a consistent LT and seasonal response for the Northern Hemisphere locations regardless of latitude. However, the Southern Hemisphere locations exhibit much greater LT and seasonal variation. In particular, we find a complex response in the four stations located within the Southern Andes region, which indicates that the strong dynamical atmospheric activity, such as the gravity waves prevalent here, disrupts, and masks the seasonality and dependence on the astronomical sources."

Our analysis shows that the distribution of daily Arctic SAT changes substantially, with Arctic mean temperatures being distinguishable from pre‐industrial levels on 84% and 97% of days at 1.5 and 2°C of global warming, respectively, and on virtually every day at 3°C of global warming. This shift is primarily due to the rapid rise in average temperature resulting from Arctic amplification and is exacerbated by a decrease in the variability of daily Arctic SAT of approximately 8.5% per degree of global warming. The changes in mean temperature and variability are more pronounced in the cold seasons than in summer, resulting in a weakened and shifted seasonal cycle of Arctic SAT. Moreover, the intensity and frequency of warm and cold extreme events change to varying degrees. The hottest days warm slightly more, while the coldest days warm 4–5 times more than the global average temperature, making extreme cold events rare. Changes in local SAT vary regionally across the Arctic and are most significant in areas of sea‐ice loss. Our findings underscore the Arctic's amplified sensitivity to global warming and emphasize the urgent need to limit global warming to mitigate impacts on human and natural systems."

These models have been applied to estimate exposure from sources such as on‐road vehicles, power plants, industrial sources, and wildfires. We categorize these models based on their approaches for assessing emissions and atmospheric processes (e.g., statistical or first principles), their exposure units (direct physical measures or indirect measures/scaled indices), and their temporal and spatial scales. While most of the studies we discuss are from the United States, the methodologies and models are applicable to other countries and regions. We recommend identifying the key physical processes that determine exposure from a given source and using a model that sufficiently accounts for these processes. For instance, PGMs use first principles parameterizations of atmospheric processes and provide source impacts exposure variability in concentration units, although approaches within PGMs for source attribution introduce uncertainties relative to the base model and are difficult to evaluate. Evaluation is important but difficult—since source‐specific exposure is difficult to observe, the most direct evaluation methods involve comparisons with alternative models."

 The uncertainty regarding the correlation between sea spray aerosol (SSA) formation and sea surface temperature (SST) hinders the accurate estimation of SSA’s impact on global climate. Here, we developed a temperature-controlled plunging SSA simulation tank to investigate the impact of SST on SSA formation from two perspectives: SSA particle size distribution and organic enrichment. Our findings show that SSA particle size decreases with decreasing SST, as exhibited by an increase in SSA within Aitken mode and a decrease in SSA within accumulation and coarse modes. SST can significantly enhance organic enrichment in SSA particles, while the multiplicative increases vary from 2 to 10 times depending on the organic matter species and the SSA particle size. Based on our experimental results, it is predicted that SST reduction may lead to a significantly higher contribution of Aitken modal SSA-derived CCN in cold waters (0 °C) than in warm waters (30 °C). Additionally, we incorporate SST for the first time in estimating the global flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) emitted via SSA, yielding a value ranging from 23.45 to 55.78 Tg C yr−1. Compared to previous works, our study reveals the crucial role of SST in influencing both cloud formation and the atmospheric organic burden of SSA."

To address this, we developed a remote sensing-based process model by integrating high-resolution vegetation indices and multi-layer soil hydrological module, to simulate monthly GPP at a 30 m resolution across Hainan Island from 2000 to 2020. The finer GPP can capture more spatial details and show higher accuracy at site scales (R = 0.79 and NRMSE = 14.79 %). Trend analysis and Hurst exponent were used to reveal spatiotemporal dynamics and sustainability of GPP. Meanwhile, nonlinear Granger causality tests quantified both concurrent and lagged correlations between various environmental factors and GPP. The results indicated significant GPP increases across 98.5 % of vegetated areas, with an annual rise of 437.02 g C/m2, and a marked improvement in trends around 2011. Future projections suggest sustained high GPP sustainability (Hurst = 0.53), and reducing “positive-inconsistent” areas in the northeast and southwest is crucial for enhancing local carbon sinks. Furthermore, water availability, temperature, and radiation were primary drivers of GPP changes, affecting 53.55 %, 27.77 %, and 14.43 % of vegetated areas, respectively, with their compounded effects enhancing explanatory power by 35.84 %. Relative humidity dominated water availability impacts on GPP (10.02 % to 79.98 % variation), surpassing precipitation and soil moisture impacts. Lag effects were observed in 68.83 % of vegetated areas, with 1 to 4-month delays in responses to net solar radiation and surface temperature, especially in forest and shrubland ecosystems. This study provides deeper insights into fine-scale GPP simulations and analysis of climate interactions, which are crucial for effective carbon cycle management in tropical ecosystems."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107763,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了北极海冰减少对北印度洋海温的影响。文章指出，北极海冰减少可以通过三种途径影响北印度洋海温：大气环流、西太平洋海温以及青藏高原陆地。首先，北极海冰减少会引发从北大西洋到北印度洋的大气遥相关波列和环流异常；其次，北极海冰减少会诱导从北极经欧亚大陆到西太平洋的波列传播，导致南海反气旋异常和海温上升；第三，北极海冰减少会增强跨赤道气流。 这项研究利用了卫星观测数据和气候模式数据，揭示了北极和热带印度洋之间联系，加深了我们对气候变化的理解。研究中涉及到的卫星观测数据很可能包括用于监测海温、海冰和大气环流的卫星数据，例如NOAA卫星、Aqua/Terra卫星等。,"['Sea surface temperature', 'Atmospheric circulation', 'Satellite observations', 'Climate change', 'Arctic sea ice']",Xiaojing Li;Jie Zhang;Xinyu Fang;Xizi Rao,Reduction in Arctic sea ice amplifies the warming of the northern Indian Ocean,"•We found the transfer station where the Arctic affects the IO SST, expanding the study of Arctic-tropical links; •There are three ways to influence the Arctic sea ice on the NIO SST: the atmosphere, the western Pacific SST and the TP; •The future changes of these three approaches are predicted under the SSP245 scenario of CMIP6 from 2015 to 2045. 
 The sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Indian Ocean(IO) has experienced rapid warming over the past 40 years. The reason for this phenomenon is still debated. Our study suggests that the decrease in Arctic sea ice during winter can influence the warming of SST in the Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) through three main pathway including atmospheric circulation, western Pacific SST and Tibet Plateau land. Firstly, the reduction of Arctic sea ice can trigger atmospheric teleconnection wave trains and circulation anomalies from the North Atlantic to the NIO, leading to anticyclone anomaly in the Bay of Bengal(BOB) that increases thermal contribution by radiation warming, as well as cyclonic anomalies in the Arabian Sea(AS) that increases dynamic contribution by warm current transport. Secondly, the reduction of Arctic sea ice can induce a wave train propagating from the Arctic through Eurasia to the western Pacific, resulting in anticyclone anomalies and SST rise in the South China Sea, thus enhancing the dynamic contribution of heat transfer through the Indonesian through flow(ITF). Thirdly,Arctic sea ice can enhances cross-equatorial flow by inducing warm surface temperature of the Tibetan Plateau.These three pathways will still exist until 2045 in future SSP245 emission scenarios.This study establishes a connection between the Arctic and the tropical IO, expanding our understanding of the relationship between these regions."

Sheffield;Britt A. Parker;Genoveva Deheza,Anthropogenic warming has ushered in an era of temperature-dominated droughts in the western United States,"Historically, meteorological drought in the western United States (WUS) has been driven primarily by precipitation deficits. However, our observational analysis shows that, since around 2000, rising surface temperature and the resulting high evaporative demand have contributed more to drought severity (62%) and coverage (66%) over the WUS than precipitation deficit. This increase in evaporative demand during droughts, mostly attributable to anthropogenic warming according to analyses of both observations and climate model simulations, is the main cause of the increased drought severity and coverage. The unprecedented 2020–2022 WUS drought exemplifies this shift in drought drivers, with high evaporative demand accounting for 61% of its severity, compared to 39% from precipitation deficit. Climate model simulations corroborate this shift and project that, under the fossil-fueled development scenario (SSP5-8.5), droughts like the 2020–2022 event will transition from a one-in-more-than-a-thousand-year event in the pre-2022 period to a 1-in-60-year event by the mid-21st century and to a 1-in-6-year event by the late-21st century."

Their relationship will help to better understand the regional carbon cycle and assess climate forcing effects. In this study, mixing ratios of CO2 and CO were continuously measured using a Picarro gas concentration analyzer at the Atmospheric Boundary Layer Eco-Environmental Shanghuang Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ABLECAS) throughout 2022–2023. The variability of the mixing ratio of CO to CO2 (ΔCO/ΔCO2) in a 1 h time interval was calculated based on linear slope analysis after background values were determined and subtracted. The results showed that the mixing ratio of CO had a clear seasonal variability with a moderate increase in the spring (249.1 ± 59.6 part per billion (ppb)) and winter (257.8 ± 90.3 ppb), mostly due to more frequent transport from north of the Yangtze River. ΔCO/ΔCO2 at the ABLECAS varied with air mass origin, with a linear slope 0%–1% on a 1 h basis. Relatively high ΔCO/ΔCO2 values for an air mass from the north in the winter indicate that the emission sources had lower combustion efficiency. In summer, the ΔCO/ΔCO2 ratio mostly reflected the background conditions for air masses from marine areas. The potential source regions and contribution assignments were evaluatedat the ABLECAS according to source–receptor relationship analysis using the FLEXPART model with CO as a pollutant tracer from 2015 to 2023. We found that the footprint of an air mass had a clear transition period between 2018 and 2019, and a synoptic anomaly, related to Arctic Oscillation strength and west Pacific subtropical high position, plays a key role in influencing the pollutant transport patterns. This study provides a scientific basis for the formulation of air quality regulation policy, and helps to implement the national carbon neutralization strategy."

Nonmigrating diurnal tides are persistent global oscillations. We investigate nonmigrating diurnal tidal variations in metal layers using satellite observations and global climate model simulations; these have not been studied previously due to the limitations of measurements. The nonmigrating diurnal tides in temperature are strongly linked to the corresponding change in metal layers. 
 The influence of nonmigrating diurnal tides on Na layer variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere regions is investigated for the first time using data from the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS) on the Odin satellite and Specified Dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM) with metal chemistry. The Na density from OSIRIS exhibits a clear longitudinal variation indicative of the presence of tidal components. Similar variability is seen in the SD-WACCM result. Analysis shows a significant relationship between the nonmigrating diurnal tides in Na density and the corresponding temperature tidal signal. Below 90 km, the three nonmigrating diurnal tidal components in Na density show a significant positive correlation with the temperature tides. Conversely, the phase mainly indicates a negative correlation above 95 km. Around the metal layer peak, the response of the Na density to a 1 K change in tidal temperature is estimated to be 120 cm−3."

The SIT dataset is compared with observations from upward-looking sonars and airborne laser altimetry from Operation IceBridge, as well as seven publicly released Arctic SIT products. Generally, the newly developed SIT product shows good performance in terms of time series, spatial resolution, and accuracy compared with existing products. 
 Arctic sea ice plays a crucial role in studies of regional and global climate change. Satellite observations have shown that the extent of Arctic sea ice has been declining over the last four decades. However, long-term variations in Arctic sea ice thickness (SIT) have received less attention because SIT cannot be measured directly by satellite-based instruments. Here, we present a monthly Arctic SIT product based on multiple radar altimetry observations from ERS-2, Envisat, and CryoSat-2. To ensure the accuracy of the SIT retrievals, a novel data processing method is proposed, including leads detection, freeboard conversion to thickness, and inter-mission bias correction. Finally, the monthly SIT estimates for the Arctic Ocean from October 1995 to December 2023 are generated. The thickness estimates are posted on a 5 km resolution polar stereographic grid. The variations in Arctic SIT are analyzed in terms of spatial and temporal distributions. Furthermore, the SIT estimates are compared with observations from upward-looking sonars and airborne laser altimetry from Operation IceBridge, as well as seven publicly released Arctic SIT products. The validation results demonstrate that our SIT product has accuracy equivalent to existing products. The accuracy of our products varies from 0.2 m to 0.4 m according to the input satellite altimetry data.

McMichael;Michael J. Schmidt;Robert Wood;Peter N. Blossey;Lekha Patel,Exploring ship track spreading rates with a physics-informed Langevin particle parameterization,"Marine cloud brightening (MCB) is a climate intervention technique to potentially cool the climate. Climate models used to gauge regional climate impacts associated with MCB often assume large areas of the ocean are uniformly perturbed. However, a more realistic representation of MCB application would require information about how an injected particle plume spreads. This work aims to develop such a plume-spreading model. 
 The rate at which aerosols spread from a point source injection, such as from a ship or other stationary pollution source, is critical for accurately representing subgrid plume spreading in a climate model. Such climate model results will guide future decisions regarding the feasibility and application of large-scale intentional marine cloud brightening (MCB). Prior modeling studies have shown that the rate at which ship plumes spread may be strongly dependent on meteorological conditions, such as precipitating versus non-precipitating boundary layers and shear. In this study, we apply a Lagrangian particle model (PM-ABL v1.0), governed by a Langevin stochastic differential equation, to create a simplified framework for predicting the rate of spreading from a ship-injected aerosol plume in sheared, precipitating, and non-precipitating boundary layers. The velocity and position of each stochastic particle is predicted with the acceleration of each particle being driven by the turbulent kinetic energy, dissipation rate, momentum variance, and mean wind. These inputs to the stochastic particle velocity equation are derived from high-fidelity large-eddy simulations (LES) equipped with a prognostic aerosol–cloud microphysics scheme (UW-SAM) to simulate an aerosol injection from a ship into a cloud-topped marine boundary layer. The resulting spreading rate from the reduced-order stochastic model is then compared to the spreading rate in the LES. The stochastic particle velocity representation is shown to reasonably reproduce spreading rates in sheared, precipitating, and non-precipitating cases using domain-averaged turbulent statistics from the LES."

This could be used to study air quality or climate and air quality interaction at a global scale. This new model scales well in high-performance computing environments and performs well with respect to ground surface networks in terms of ozone and PM2.5. 
 The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model has been used for regulatory purposes at the U.S. EPA and in the research community for decades. In 2012, we released the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-CMAQ coupled model that enables aerosol information from CMAQ to affect meteorological processes through direct effects on shortwave radiation. Both CMAQ and WRF-CMAQ are considered limited-area models. Recently, we have extended domain coverage to the global scale by linking the meteorological Model for Prediction Across Scales – Atmosphere (MPAS-A, hereafter referred simply to as MPAS) with CMAQ to form the MPAS-CMAQ global coupled model. To configure these three different models, i.e., CMAQ (offline), WRF-CMAQ, and MPAS-CMAQ, we have developed the Advanced Air Quality Modeling System (AAQMS) for constructing each of them effortlessly. We evaluate this newly built MPAS-CMAQ coupled model using two global configurations: a 120 km uniform mesh and a 92–25 km variable mesh with the finer area over North America. Preliminary computational tests show good scalability and model evaluation, when using a 3-year simulation (2014–2016) for the uniform mesh case and a monthly simulation of January and July 2016 for the variable mesh case, on ozone and PM2.5 and show reasonable performance with respect to observations. The 92–25 km configuration has a high bias in wintertime surface ozone across the United States, and this bias is consistent with the 120 km result. Summertime surface ozone in the 92–25 km configuration is less biased than the 120 km case. The MPAS-CMAQ system reasonably reproduces the daily variability of daily average PM from the Air Quality System (AQS) network."

Because of their atmospheric concentrations, there is the question of whether MP can act as ice nucleating particles in the atmosphere. This study investigates the immersion freezing activity of lab-prepared MP of four different compositions─low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)─using droplet freezing assays. The MP are also exposed to ultraviolet light, ozone, sulfuric acid, and ammonium sulfate to mimic environmental aging of the plastics to elucidate the role that these processes play in the ice nucleating activity of MP. Results show that all studied MP act as immersion nuclei, and aging processes can modify this ice nucleating activity, leading, primarily, to decreases in ice nucleating activity for LDPE, PP, and PET. The ice nucleating activity of PVC generally increased following aging, which we attribute to a cleaning of chemical defects present on the surface of the stock material. Chemical changes were monitored with infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and the growth of a peak at 1650–1800 cm–1 was associated with a decrease in ice nucleating activity while loss of an existing peak in that region was associated with an increase in ice nucleating activity. The studied MP have ice nucleating activities sufficient to be a non-negligible source of ice nucleating particles in the atmosphere if present in sufficiently high concentrations."

In many major urban centers of Africa, there is limited to nonexistent information on air quality. This is gradually changing in part due to the increasing use of micro air sensors, which have the potential to enable the generation of ground-based air quality data at fine scales for understanding local emission trends. Regional literature on the application of  high-resolution data for emission source identification in this region is limited. In this study a micro air sensor was colocated at the Physics Department, University of Ghana, with a reference grade instrument to evaluate its performance for estimating PM2.5 pollution accurately at fine scales and the value of these data in identification of local sources and their behavior over time. For this study, 15 weeks of data at hourly resolution with approximately 2500 data pairs were generated and analyzed (June 1, 2023, to September 15, 2023). For this time period a coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.83 was generated with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.44 μg m–3 between the pre local calibration micro air sensor (i.e., out of the box) and the reference-grade instrument. Following currently accepted best practice methods (see, e.g., PAS4023) a domain specific (i.e., local) calibration factor was generated using a multilinear regression model, and when this factor is applied to the micro air sensor data, a reduction, i.e. improvement, in MAE to 1.43 μg m–3 was found. Daily variation was calculated, a receptor model was applied, and time series plots as a function of wind direction were generated, including PM2.5/PM10 ratio scatter and count plots, to explore the utility of this observational approach for local source identification. The 3 data sets were compared (out of the box, domain calibrated, and reference-grade) and it was found that although there were variations in the data reported, source areas highlighted based on these data were similar, with input from local sources such as traffic emissions and biomass burning.

Especially when multiple TPAs appear simultaneously, they join at the auroral signature of the cusp. Here we investigate the dayside connection point of TPAs using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program measurements and identify three cases where the tip of the TPA ends in a localized brightening. One is a typical cusp spot with a TPA attached. The cusp appears just poleward of the oval with a near circular shape. In the second case, multiple cusp spots are observed over a 3 MLT wide region, each connected to a TPA. In the third case, the brightening at the tip of a TPA is identified as high‐latitude dayside aurora (HiLDA). Cusp aurora appears between the HiLDA and the duskside oval.

This study examined the relationship between long‐term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and the risk of arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, with the exposure period extending from recruitment until self‐reported outcomes, death, loss to follow‐up, or end of follow‐up. Additionally, the study assessed whether there was an interactive effect between PM2.5 and green space on these risks. We gathered cohort data on 18,649 individuals aged ≥45 years. We applied generalized linear mixed‐effects models to estimate the effects of PM2.5 constituents, NDVI, and their interaction on arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The quantile g‐computation and weighted quantile sum regression model were applied to estimate the combined effect of PM2.5 constituents. Our results showed that exposure to single and mixed PM2.5 constituents adversely affected arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and was mainly attributed to the black carbon component. We observed “U” or “J” shaped exposure‐response curves for the effects of PM2.5, OM, NO3− and NH4+ exposure on the development of arthritis/rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the odds ratio of arthritis for per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 was 1.209 (95% CI:1.198, 1.221), per 0.1‐unit decrease in NDVI was 1.091 (95% CI:1.033, 1.151), and the interaction term was 1.005 (95% CI:1.002, 1.007).

10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107760,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了印度夏季风期间低到高强度降雨事件的时空变化，以及气候变化的影响。研究使用了印度气象局（IMD）的观测数据和五个协调区域气候降尺度实验（CORDEX）区域气候模式（RCM）。结果表明，近几十年来，印度部分地区的降雨总量和事件频率有所下降，而其他地区则有所增加。CORDEX模式高估了历史时期强降雨区的降雨总量，为了提高模拟精度，研究采用了一种基于百分位数的偏差校正技术。未来预测表明，印度夏季风降雨总量可能不会发生显著变化，但极端和强降雨事件的频率可能会增加，而中等强度降雨事件的频率可能会下降。该研究与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据（IMD的降雨数据，虽然没有明确指出是哪种卫星，但这类数据通常来源于气象卫星）来分析降雨事件，并利用气候模式进行预测，这与大气成分分析和气候变化研究密切相关。,"['Rainfall', 'Precipitation', 'Extreme rainfall events', 'Summer monsoon', 'Climate change', 'CORDEX models', 'Satellite observations', 'Bias correction', 'IMD rainfall data']",Alugula Boyaj;Palash Sinha;U.C. Mohanty;V. Vinoj;Karumuri Ashok;Sahidul Islam;A. Kaginalkar;M. Khare,Projected frequency of low to high-intensity rainfall events over India using bias-corrected CORDEX models,"•Rainfall totals and event frequencies have decreased significantly in monsoon core zones, J&K, and parts of northeastern, while increasing in northwestern India, the Western Ghats, and southern regions in the recent era. •All CORDEX RCMs overestimate the total rainfall of ISM in heavy rainfall zones during the historical period by approximately 10–30 %. •Bias-corrected CORDEX RCMs underestimated (overestimated) ISM rainfall events in high (non-high) rainfall zones. Some corrected CORDEX models closely aligned with IMD observations for rainfall trends across regions. •Future projections indicate that there will be no significant changes in ISM total rainfall, but the frequency of total EREs will increase while moderate rainfall events decrease across India. 
 Heavy rainfall events and associated floods have emerged as one of the great threats to society that mainly manifested due the climate change. The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) contributes 80 % of annual rainfall and is characterized mainly by high-intensity rainfall events (HiREs) in the recent era. We investigated the spatiotemporal variability of HiREs from a climate change perspective by accessing the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) observed daily gridded rainfall dataset (0.25° × 0.25°) from 1961 to 2020 during the ISM season. Our observational analysis shows that the ISM total and the frequency of low- to high-intensity rainfall events have significantly decreased mostly over the central northeastern, Jammu and Kashmir, and some places in the northeastern and central parts of India. However, they have significantly increased over Gujarat, the northwestern, the Western Ghats, and the southern parts of India during the present climate period (1991–2020) compared to the past climate period (1961–1990). Furthermore, we explored the fidelity of five Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiments (CORDEX) Regional Climate Models (RCMs) in simulating the spatiotemporal variability of ISM total rainfall and the frequency of low- to high-intensity rainfall events over India during the historical (1976–2005) and future periods (2006–2100). All CORDEX RCMs overestimate the ISM total rainfall over India's heavy rainfall zones during the historical period by ∼10–30 % compared to IMD observations. To improve CORDEX RCM's skills in simulating the frequency of low- to high-intensity rainfall events, we employed a percentile-based bias correction technique. Compared to non-bias-corrected outputs from the RCMs, the quantile-bias-corrected method significantly enhanced the probability of detection rate (hit rate) in all studied models for extreme, heavy, and moderate rainfall events, excluding light rainfall events. Interestingly, the improvement is greater for extreme events, followed by heavy and moderate rainfall events. The composite hit rate of all the models shows 381 %, 146 %, and 44 % improvement for extreme, heavy, and moderate events, respectively. It is noticed that the CCCMA model performed better than the other four CORDEX models in capturing the spatial patterns of ISM total rainfall and the frequency of total extreme and heavy rainfall events over higher rainfall zones in India. Additionally, this study suggests that there will likely be no significant changes in ISM total rainfall over India in the future, but the frequency of total extreme and heavy rainfall events will most likely increase, while the frequency of moderate rainfall events will likely decrease mostly over southern parts of India in future projections."

However, climate change, already evident in the country, poses significant challenges to solar power generation. Therefore, assessing the impact of climate change on future photovoltaic potential in India is essential. This study evaluates the mid-century (2041–2050) solar photovoltaic potential across Indian power grids using CMIP6 models under two scenarios: SSP2-4.5 (moderate climate action with intermediate air pollution) and SSP5-8.5 (weak climate action with strong air pollution control). The results indicate that the nationally averaged photovoltaic potential is projected to decrease by −2.3 ± 0.6% (SSP5-8.5) to −3.3 ± 0.9% (SSP2-4.5) compared to the 1985–2014 baseline, primarily due to reduced radiation and increased temperatures. Additionally, cell temperatures are expected to rise by 1.5 ± 0.13 °C (SSP2-4.5) to 2 ± 0.11 °C (SSP5-8.5), leading to efficiency losses and additional 18 ± 5 d under SSP2-4.5 (26 ± 3 d under SSP5-8.5) of efficiency de-rating, particularly in solar-rich regions. This translates to a loss of 600 ± 160 GWh under SSP2-4.5 and 840 ± 100 GWh under SSP5-8.5, based on the solar generation status of 2023–24. Overall, SSP5-8.5 projects a smaller reduction in photovoltaic potential, it also predicts greater temperature-induced efficiency losses compared to SSP2-4.5, due to aerosol direct effect and weak climate action. Finally, this assessment highlights the need for combined climate and pollution mitigation efforts to boost India’s photovoltaic potential and secure a sustainable, resilient energy future."

This method is verified from a theoretical perspective, and it performs well for thickly coated BC at high RHs. 
 Water content in the coatings of aged black carbon (BC) aerosol can be reflected through the complex refractive index. In this study, the retrieval of the refractive index and water content for  non-absorbing coatings of BC aerosol during  hygroscopic growth (RH = 0 %–95 %) based on scattering and absorption properties is theoretically investigated. Optical properties of morphologically realistic fractal BC aerosols are simulated using the multiple-sphere T-matrix method (MSTM), the optical equivalent refractive index of coating material is retrieved based on the Mie theory, and the water content in coatings is further retrieved using effective medium theory. Results show that the scattering property performs best in retrieving the refractive index and water content. The retrieval errors of the refractive index of heavily aged BC aerosols are less than 10 % at high relative humidities (RHs), while partially coated BC and thinly coated BC have larger errors. The regularity of retrieved water content is similar to that of the refractive index retrieved, and the retrieved water content errors range from 2 % to 63 % for heavily coated BC. This study provides a helpful optical method to obtain the water content of BC coatings."

 We reviewed 60 sensor networks and 17 related efforts (sensor review papers and data accessibility projects) to better understand the landscape of stationary low-cost gas-phase sensor networks deployed in outdoor environments worldwide. This study is not exhaustive of every gas-phase sensor network on the globe but rather exists to categorize types of sensor networks by their key characteristics and explore general trends. This also exposes gaps in monitoring efforts to date, especially regarding the availability of gas-phase measurements compared to particulate matter (PM) and geographic coverage gaps (the Global South, rural areas). We categorize ground-based networks that measure gas-phase air pollutants into two main subsets based on their deployment type – quasi-permanent (long term) and campaign (short to medium term) – and explore commonplace practices, strengths, and weaknesses of stationary monitoring networks.

Dust emission modifications make deflation areas more continuous, improving results in North America and the sub-Arctic. Humidity correction to sea-salt emissions has a minor effect. Introducing marine organic aerosol emissions, coupled with ocean biogeochemical processes, and adding aqueous reactions for SOA formation advance the CESM's aerosol modelling results. 
 Aerosols constitute important substance components of the Earth's atmosphere and have a profound influence on climate dynamics, radiative properties, and biogeochemical processes. Here we introduce updated emission schemes for dust, sea-salt, and marine primary organic aerosols (MPOA), as well as augmented secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation pathways within the Community Earth System Model (CESM; version 2.1.3). The modified dust emission scheme shifts the original hotspot-like dust emission to a more continuous distribution, improving the dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD) simulations at stations in north Africa and central Asia. This update also reduces dust residence time from 4.1 to 1.6 d, enhancing concentration simulations downwind of dust source regions. For sea-salt emissions, we incorporate an updated sea surface temperature (SST) modulation and introduce a relative-humidity-dependent correction factor for sea-salt particle size, with SST having a significantly larger impact on sea-salt emissions (16.1 %) compared to the minor effect of humidity (−0.3 %). We then extend our modelling to incorporate emissions of marine primary organic aerosols (MPOA) as mixed externally with sea-salt aerosols, coupled offline with the ocean component Parallel Ocean Program (POP2). The results underscore the substantial influence of phytoplankton diversity on MPOA emissions, with 148 % variability simulated among different phytoplankton types, highlighting the role of biological variability in aerosol modelling. Furthermore, we refine the model's chemical mechanisms by including the irreversible aqueous uptake of dicarbonyl compounds as a new pathway for SOA formation, contributing an additional 37 % to surface SOA concentrations. These improvements enrich the ability of the CESM to use intricate linkages between different components of the Earth system, thereby enabling a more comprehensive description of natural aerosol emissions, chemical processes, and their impacts."

However, the contributions of temperature and O3, independently or in combination, to IHD mortality are not well understood. This study employs a two-stage analytical protocol (generalized additive model followed by meta-analysis) to explore the respective associations of temperature and O3 with IHD mortality, and determine their possible mediation and interaction effects. Our results suggest that increases of 10 μg/m3 in O3 and 1 °C in temperature at lag01 day are associated with increased IHD mortality risks of 0.789% and 0.686%, respectively. O3 can mediate the relationship between temperature and IHD mortality, with a pooled estimate of 0.140%, while temperature can mediate the association between O3 and IHD mortality, with a pooled estimate of 0.162%. The additive and multiplicative interaction effects of O3 and temperature were significantly associated with IHD mortality. The study findings demonstrate that higher temperature and O3 concentrations can increase human IHD mortality risk through interaction and mediation effects, providing a scientific basis for the synergistic management of temperature and O3 or associated interventions."

This study characterized 38 typical chromophores in aerosols collected in Xi’an, with light absorption contributions to BrC ranging from 1.6 ± 0.3 to 5.8 ± 2.6% at 365 nm. Based on these quantified chromophores, an interpretable machine learning model and the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) method were employed to explore the relationships between BrC optical properties and chemical composition. The model attained high accuracy with Pearson correlation coefficients (r) exceeding 0.93 for the absorption coefficient (Absλ) and surpassing 0.57 for mass absorption efficiency (MAEλ) of BrC. It explains more than 80% of the variance in Abs and over 50% in MAE, significantly improving the understanding of BrC light absorption. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) with four and five rings exhibit significant positive effects on Absλ, suggesting that similar unidentified chromophores may also notably impact BrC optical characteristics.

We examine the global atmospheric response to AIS meltwater in an ensemble of experiments performed using two fully coupled climate models under a pre‐industrial climate. In response to AIS meltwater, the experiments yield cooling from the surface to the tropopause over the subpolar Southern Ocean, warming in the Southern Hemisphere polar stratosphere, and cooling in the upper tropical troposphere. Positive feedbacks, initiated by disrupted ocean‐atmosphere heat exchange, result in a change in the top‐of‐atmosphere radiative balance caused primarily through surface and near‐surface albedo changes. Changes in the atmospheric thermal structure alter the jet streams aloft. The results highlight the global influence of AIS melting on the climate system and the potential for impacts on mid‐latitude climate patterns and delayed regional warming signals."

Based on observational analyses and model sensitivity experiments, this study reveals that longwave CRF at the quasi‐biweekly timescale is most closely linked to the intensity of persistent (≥3‐day) heavy rainfall events in southern China and northern India by efficiently maintaining the large‐scale convective perturbations. When CRF is disabled, the quasi‐biweekly convective anomalies supporting extreme precipitation are weakened. Additional assessments of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project historical simulations confirm that models with more accurate quasi‐biweekly longwave CRF exhibit smaller biases in capturing the amplitude of persistent heavy rainfall.

A physical explanation of this difference is related to the calibration process. In principle, for the calibration of polarimetric instruments of a total power radiometer, the radiation should be only half of the values derived from Planck function but in the actual calibration process, a full value is used. When this full value is converted to a TB it is approximately, but not exactly, twice the TB simulated by a vector radiative transfer model. This inconsistency is verified by simulations of three conically scanning microwave imagers (WindSat, AMSR2 and MWRI) and one cross‐track scanning microwave sounder (AMSU‐A). This difference cannot be compensated simply by dividing a factor of 2 to the processed TBs, especially at high frequencies or at low physical temperatures due to the nonlinear property of Planck function."

Both of these stratus cloud projects demonstrated that bimodal CCN spectra typically caused by cloud processing were associated with clouds that exhibited higher concentrations of smaller droplets with narrower distributions and less drizzle than clouds associated with unimodal CCN spectra. Resulting brighter clouds and increased cloudiness could enhance both indirect aerosol effects (IAE). These stratus findings are opposite of analogous measurements in two cumulus cloud projects, which showed bimodal CCN associated with fewer larger droplets more broadly distributed and with more drizzle than clouds associated with unimodal CCN. Resulting reduced cumulus brightness and cloudiness could reduce both IAE. Physics of Stratocumulus Tops (POST) flights in air masses with higher CCN concentrations, NCCN, showed more extremes of the stratus characteristics. However, POST flights with lower NCCN showed opposite droplet characteristics similar to the cumulus clouds, yet still showed less drizzle in clouds associated with bimodal CCN, but not as much less as the flights with higher NCCN. Since all MASE clouds were in polluted air masses, while the two cumulus projects were in clean air masses we deduce from these four projects that both the dynamic stratus/cumulus differences (vertical wind) and NCCN are responsible for the microphysics and drizzle differences among these projects. This is because the clean POST characteristics are a hybrid between MASE/POST high NCCN and the two cumulus projects."

 Atmospheric aerosol particles are essential for forming clouds and precipitation, thereby influencing Earth’s energy budget, water cycle and climate on regional and global scales. However, the origin of aerosol particles over the Amazon rainforest during the wet season is poorly understood. Earlier studies showed new particle formation in the outflow of deep convective clouds and suggested a downward flux of aerosol particles during precipitation events. Here we use comprehensive aerosol, trace gas and meteorological data from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory to show that rainfall regularly induces bursts of nanoparticles in the nucleation size range. This can be attributed to rain-related scavenging of larger particles and a corresponding reduction of the condensation sink, along with an ozone injection into the forest canopy, which could increase the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds, especially terpenes, and enhance new particle formation. During and after rainfall, the nucleation particle concentrations directly above the canopy are greater than those higher up. This gradient persists throughout the wet season for the nucleation size range, indicating continuous particle formation within the canopy, a net upward flux of newly formed particles and a paradigm shift in understanding aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions in the Amazon. Particle bursts provide a plausible explanation for the formation of cloud condensation nuclei, leading to the local formation of green-ocean clouds and precipitation. Our findings suggest that an interplay of a rain-related reduction in the condensation sink, primary emissions of gases, mainly terpenes, and particles from the forest canopy, and convective cloud processing determines the population of cloud condensation nuclei in pristine rainforest air. Rainfall induces nanoparticle bursts within the Amazon rainforest canopy by scavenging large particles and bringing down ozone-rich air, according to aerosol, trace gas and meteorology data from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory."

 Wildfire activity and the hydrological cycle are strongly interlinked. While it is well known that wildfire occurrence and intensity are controlled by water availability, less is known about the effects of wildfire on plant and soil water cycling, especially at large scales. Here we investigate this by analysing fire impacts on the coupling between plant and soil water content, at the global scale, using remote sensing of soil moisture, vegetation water content and burned area. We find a strong effect of fire on plant–soil water relations, accelerating soil moisture loss by 17% and leading to faster gains in vegetation water content by 62%, both of which are positively related to fire severity and largest in forests. This effect is spatially extensive, with accelerated soil moisture loss found in 67%, and increased vegetation water content gain found in 67% of all analysed burned areas. After fire, plants also tended to have less control on their water content (that is, were more anisohydric). In summary, fire changes ecosystem functioning by increasing ecosystem water losses and shifting the relationship between soil and vegetation water budgets. With climate change, wildfire is likely to play an increasingly important role in ecosystem water cycling and subsequent ecosystem recovery. Fire affects the hydrological interactions between soil and vegetation, leading to faster soil moisture loss and accelerated vegetation water uptake, according to a global analysis of satellite observations on soil moisture, vegetation water content and burned area."

Here, the authors show a map of the magnetic fields and ionospheric currents of Mars, revealing two ionospheric currents that are driven by the solar wind and atmospheric neutral winds. 
 When the solar wind interacts with the ionosphere of an unmagnetized planet, it induces currents that form an induced magnetosphere. These currents and their associated magnetic fields play a pivotal role in controlling the movement of charged particles, which is essential for understanding the escape of planetary ions. Unlike the well-documented magnetospheric current systems, the ionospheric current systems driven by solar wind and atmospheric neutral winds have not been quantitatively observed, which constrains the quantification of energy transfer from stars to these planets. Here, utilizing eight years of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, we investigate the global distribution of ionospheric currents on Mars. We identify two distinct current systems in the ionosphere: one aligns with the solar wind electric field but exhibits hemispheric asymmetry perpendicular to the solar wind electric field direction; the other corresponds to the flow pattern of annually averaged neutral winds. We propose that these two current systems are driven by the solar wind and atmospheric neutral winds, respectively. Our findings reveal that Martian ionospheric dynamics are influenced by the neutral winds from below and the solar wind from above, highlighting the complex and intriguing nature of current systems on unmagnetized planets.

 Antarctic sea ice exerts great influence on Earth’s climate by controlling the exchange of heat, momentum, freshwater, and gases between the atmosphere and ocean. Antarctic sea ice extent has undergone a multidecadal slight increase followed by a substantial decline since 2016. Here we utilize a 300-yr sea ice data assimilation reconstruction and two NOAA/GFDL and five CMIP6 model simulations to demonstrate a multidecadal variability of Antarctic sea ice extent. Stronger westerlies associated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) enhance the upwelling of warm and saline water from the subsurface ocean. The consequent salinity increase weakens the upper-ocean stratification, induces deep convection, and in turn brings more subsurface warm and saline water to the surface. This salinity-convection feedback triggered by the SAM provides favorable conditions for multidecadal sea ice decrease. Processes acting in reverse are found to cause sea ice increase, although it evolves slower than sea ice decrease.

Compare land cover type proportions in burned area with land cover type proportions in New Mexico.MethodsWe used remotely sensed data from NASA’s ECOsystem and Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) to collect ET, WUE, & ESI data. Data were analyzed for burned areas of 10 wildfires that occurred in New Mexico between 2020 and 2022, segmenting the following land cover types: evergreen needleleaf forests, closed shrublands, open shrublands, savannas, woody savannas, grasslands, and other.ResultsET & ESI increased throughout the duration of the wildfires, while WUE decreased. ET vs. WUE were more strongly correlated post-fire (R2 = 0.85) than pre-fire (R2 = 0.20), as was WUE vs. ESI (post-fire, R2 = 0.59; pre-fire, R2 = 0.04). Pre- and post-fire ET and ESI were positively correlated (R2 = 0.61 pre-fire, R2 = 0.53 post-fire), while post-fire WUE was negatively correlated with both post-fire ET (R2 = 0.85) and ESI (R2 = 0.59). We found that the land cover composition of the areas burned by the 10 studied wildfires differs from the land cover composition of New Mexico as a whole (p < 0.05).ConclusionsOur findings present increasing trends in ET and ESI, and decreasing trends in WUE before, during, and after a wildfire. By monitoring changes in those three variables, we can identify areas that are at high risk for wildfires. Savannas and woody savannas should be closely monitored because a disproportionately large proportion of acres burned in 2022 were savannas and woody savannas."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120909,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了地中海落叶林土壤中生物挥发性有机化合物（BVOCs）的排放，以及长期干旱对其排放的影响。研究发现，长期干旱导致土壤BVOCs排放量减少了43%，土壤呼吸作用是影响土壤BVOCs排放的重要因素。该研究使用了质子转移反应飞行时间质谱仪（PTR-ToF-MS）对土壤BVOCs进行了详细的昼夜变化观测，并分析了温度、湿度、土壤呼吸作用等因素的影响。虽然研究本身没有直接使用大气环境遥感技术，如卫星观测，但其结果对于改进区域和全球尺度下土壤BVOCs排放模型具有重要意义，这些模型可以与大气遥感数据结合，用于更准确地模拟和预测大气成分变化，以及评估气候变化的影响。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术间接相关。,"['Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)', 'Atmospheric chemistry', 'Climate change', 'Soil respiration', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations (indirectly)', 'Greenhouse gas emissions']",T.

Ormeño,Decline of soil volatile organic compounds from a Mediterranean deciduous forest under a future drier climate,"•BVOC forest soil emission rate decreased by 43% under long term amplified drought (after 10 years of summer rain exclusion). •Forest soil respiration was a strong driver of soil BVOC emissions. •Temperature was positively correlated to forest soil BVOC emissions following Tingey's model. •Forest soil BVOC followed a diurnal pattern with maximum emissions during central hours of the day. •Forest soil was mainly a source of BVOC but it was a sink of isoprene. 
 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are crucial for ecosystem functioning, atmospheric chemistry and climate. While modulation of BVOC emissions from living vegetation with biotic and abiotic factors is well documented, how these factors drive soil BVOC emissions remain less understood, particularly in Mediterranean forests. To fill this gap, this pioneer study investigates whether BVOC fluxes from natural soil covered by litter (referred to as forest soil) vary under natural and amplified long-term water stress (35% annual rain exclusion over the past 10 years) in a deciduous oak Mediterranean forest (Quercus pubescens Willd.) compared to natural climate conditions. This aim has only been tackled in a single evergreen Mediterranean forest so far. Using proton transfer reaction time of flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) we also provide, for the first time, a detailed diurnal cycle of soil BVOCs in relation to air temperature, air humidity, and biotic factors including soil respiration and litter content in lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. The main results revealed that forest soil represents a source of most BVOCs (e.g., acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, hexanol, monoterpenes) with maximum values at mid-day (42 μgC.m−2. h−1) in response to higher temperatures while it acts as a clear sink of isoprene. Total soil BVOC emission rates, together with soil respiration, decreased by 43% after a decade of partial rain restriction. These results will contribute to enhance further modeling of soil BVOC emissions under various climate scenarios both at regional and global scales."

Collins,Direct measurement of the growth of small particles in ambient air using captive aerosol chambers,"•Two identical Captive Aerosol Growth and Evolution (CAGE) chambers were operated at the DOE SGP site in 2021. •The sensitivity of particle growth to precursors was studied by adding them at a controlled rate to one of the chambers. •The influence of aerosol liquid water on secondary aerosol formation and particle growth was investigated. 
 Formation and growth of particles influence the solar radiation budget and the microphysics and properties of clouds. Quantifying the rate at which atmospheric particles grow and understanding the meteorological and chemical controls of that growth are challenging because observations at a fixed location represent a convolution of changes resulting from atmospheric processing and those reflecting the time-varying origin and history of the sampled air. The dual-chamber Captive Aerosol Growth and Evolution (CAGE) chamber system was developed to study particle growth in different environments. Inside the chambers, controlled populations of particles are exposed to an environment in which the air composition and solar intensity track those just outside. Here we present results from the use of the CAGE chamber system at the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program's Southern Great Plains (SGP) site over two months in the fall of 2021. Both chambers were operated continuously, with monodisperse seed particles injected every several hours and then intermittently measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer. The time dependence of the growth rate measured throughout the study is quantified. The sensitivity of particle growth to the liquid water content of injected seed particles and to the addition of precursor gases was studied by using one chamber as a reference or control and the other as a perturbation chamber."

 This study analyzes the interplay between tropical cyclones (TCs) and drought in Taiwan over the period from 1981 to 2022, leveraging data from CHIRPS, FLDAS, IBTrACS, and Sentinel and Landsat satellite imagery. Our findings reveal a significant decline in TC-induced rainfall over the last decade, with a turning point in 2017. We establish a low to moderate positive correlation between TC-induced rainfall and subsequent spring soil moisture levels, with April exhibiting the strongest connection. This relationship strengthens in transitions from agricultural to forested areas. Additionally, our research identifies a robust correlation (r = 0.77) between TC-induced rainfall and reservoir water levels, underscoring the consistent link between TCs and hydrological drought. However, intriguing disparities emerge in water availability patterns. In 2007 and 2020, reservoirs maintained normal levels despite reduced typhoon rainfall in prior years. Conversely, in 2019, water shortages occurred despite typical TC-induced rainfall. These cases suggest that water availability is influenced by factors beyond TCs, including water demand, infrastructure, monsoon and spring rainfall, air temperature, and water management strategies. Furthermore, we uncover a symmetrical relationship between TCs and monsoon-induced rainfall, indicating their potential to balance reservoir water supply. Nevertheless, both TCs and the monsoon exhibit declining trends in the past decade, heightening the risk of spring season water scarcity in Taiwan. Effective water resource management demands consideration of natural and anthropogenic factors, encompassing land use changes, deforestation, production activities, water pollution, and policy strategies. These measures are essential to mitigate water scarcity and promote sustainability in Taiwan."

 This study investigates the influence of early spring (March–April) soil moisture (SM) over the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) on the interannual variation of South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM) onset, using observational analyses and numerical experiments. It is found that when early spring SM over the GMS is wetter, westerly anomalies dominate the South China Sea, corresponding to an early onset of the SCSSM, and vice versa. The analyses of physical mechanism show that the positive anomalies of early spring SM decrease local surface air temperature by adjusting the surface latent heat flux and sensible heat flux. The persistence of anomalous ground cooling contributes to negative geopotential height anomalies in the middle troposphere, and further induces the eastward retreat of western North Pacific subtropical high in May. The anomalous cyclone over the South China Sea favors the early onset of SCSSM. The key physical processes linking the variability of early spring SM over the GMS and the following SCSSM onset are confirmed by the sensitivity experiments using a coupled atmosphere–land model (CAM6–CLM5). Specifically, the onset date of the SCSSM in the drier experiment is 11 days later than that in the wetter experiment. The present results have implications for the forecast of SCSSM onset."

 The unique terrain and complex atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) processes result in a distinctive spatiotemporal distribution of dust in the Tarim Basin; however, this distribution remains unclear under continuous clear-sky conditions. In this study, 382 cases were selected to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of dust and its potential mechanisms based on MERRA-2 and ERA5 reanalysis datasets combined with MODIS satellite observations during the warm seasons from 2000 to 2023. Taking the typical case of a completely cloudless on July 24–27, 2016, the dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD) at the margin of the Tarim Basin increased with time. The climatological characteristics showed a high DAOD in the northern, western, and southwestern regions and a relatively low DAOD in the central area. Nocturnal low-level jets dominated by northeasterly winds enhance the low-level westward airflow in weak anticyclonic systems, causing dust accumulation in the west and north of the basin. Vertical mixing within the ABL during the daytime increases dust loading in the residual layer, and these dust particles can ascend to high altitudes after breaking through the ABL by the vertical circulation. The dust loading at the lower level during the daytime was higher than that at night, whereas the opposite was true for the upper level. The downward airflow in the northwest slope of the Tibetan plateau weakens at night, leading to dust being uplifted to higher altitudes and transported outside the Tarim Basin by the westerlies. These results enhance our understanding of dust distribution and related mechanisms in Tarim Basin and support the development and utilization of climatic resources in this region."

Spectra-derived lists of formulas and their relative abundances are used to compare ambient OA from different sources or to monitor secondary OA formation under controlled laboratory conditions in smog chamber experiments. Various techniques are implemented to visualize common and unique features, series of precursors, and products. The disadvantage of this conventional approach is in associating elemental compositions to specific compounds, while due to several analytical limitations, the structural information remains hidden. We argue that some of the conclusions derived from this data analysis can be misleading. In this study, we applied in-ESI source H/D exchange (HDX), which facilitated enumeration of labile protons in molecules behind elemental compositions of OA. We applied this technique to compare OA from three different locations representing urban, forest, and marine environments and to examine tentative chemical information derived from Kendrick mass defect (KMD) series analysis. Significant discrepancies were found between numbers of labile protons in protogenic functional groups and the stoichiometry of chemical reactions, which are associated with KMD series. Only a portion of chemical pairs matched target stoichiometries, which highlights the existing limitations in environmental applications of conventional formula-based HRMS data interpretation strategies."

At other times and locations, the w $w$ profiles reveal Kelvin‐Helmholtz billows. Finally, the variability of w $w$ variance over the 4 month campaign period is investigated. Using brightness temperature from geostationary satellites as a convective proxy, it is found that w $w$ variance is highly correlated with fluctuations in convective activity."

This study investigates the impact of greenery (EVI2), canopy cover (CC), impervious cover (IC), and water bodies on heat index in Chicago using high‐resolution data from the Heat Watch campaign. We find that EVI2, CC and proximity to water body significantly reduce heat while IC increases heat, particularly in the afternoon when solar radiation is intense.

 Disentangling the impact of climate change on environmental extremes is of key importance for mitigation and adaptation. Here we present an automated system that unveils the climate change signal of the day in near-real-time, employing a set of innovative storyline simulations based on a coupled climate model. Its potential to complement probabilistic assessments is showcased for storm Boris, which brought record-breaking rainfall over Central and Eastern Europe in September 2024, leading to devastating floods. Our near-real-time storylines suggest that storm Boris deposited about 9% more rain due to human-induced warming. The area impacted by the same storm’s extreme rainfall (>100 mm) was 18% larger and would continue expanding in a future warmer climate. Results from our prototype storyline system are disseminated publicly via an online tool.

 Methoxyphenols are released in abundance from lignin pyrolysis during biomass burning. Apart from being atmospheric brown carbon components that absorb solar radiation and warm the climate, methoxyphenols also undergo photoreaction in the atmospheric aqueous phase and form secondary organic aerosols (aqSOA). While efforts have been devoted to understanding chemical evolutions and climate-related optical properties of aqSOA, their potential health impacts also require timely investigations. Herein, we used the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay to investigate oxidative potential of the aqSOA formed during the 8-h aqueous-phase photoreaction of two typical methoxyphenols, vanillin and vanillic acid, under pH 2 or 8, and with or without ammonia nitrate. The highest DTT consumption rates (RDTT) were observed for vanillin aqSOA formed in the presence of ammonia nitrate and at pH 8. At pH 2, although RDTT increased rapidly during early photoreaction, it reduced after prolonged illumination. High-resolution mass spectrometry and linear regression analyses were performed to correlate the photoreaction products with the observed RDTT. Results showed that three products that present quinone, lactone and dimer structures, respectively, should be the key drivers of elevated RDTT for aqSOA formed during photoreaction of vanillin and vanillic acid alone, whereas it shifted to the nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds during their photoreaction with ammonia nitrate. Our results have revealed the role of nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds in the oxidative potential and health effects of aqSOA from biomass burning, which was rarely recognized before and warrants immediate assessments."

 Chemical transport models (CTM) tend to perform poorly in simulating pollution processes under weak turbulent diffusion conditions. In this study, we address this issue from the perspectives of vertical grid resolution and vertical mixing schemes. Three vertical grid resolution configurations (L4, L12, L40) with the CHIMERE model are evaluated during a winter episode, which includes a heavy pollution episode (PE) in the Paris region. The results emphasize the significance of vertical grid resolution, particularly noticeable during nighttime, and consequently impacts CHIMERE simulations under nocturnal stable conditions. Consistent improvement in CTM modeling is observed with refined vertical resolutions and the first layer height based on a simple linear vertical diffusion scheme defined as the initial Kz diffusion (IKD) scheme. Compared to the other two configurations, the finest configuration (referred to as L4-IKD) demonstrates an average improvement in root mean square error of 23.26 % and 25.09 % on regular days (RD) and 62 % and 129 % during PE, respectively. However, simulations using the 1.5-order turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) based eddy diffusivity closure scheme, named the new eddy diffusion (NED), are more sensitive to the first layer height setup. Excessively fine first-layer heights can lead to inaccurate TKE calculations. Generally, models with low vertical grid resolution can reasonably predict air quality on RD or during light pollution events but struggle with heavy PEs. One straightforward enhancement strategy involves adding an extra fine first layer height in CTM simulations, resulting in an average 50.10 % improvement from L4-IKD to L12-IKD during PE. Another strategy is enhancing the model's vertical diffusion scheme, which improved the CTM modeling by 26.67 % compared with IKD during PE under identical vertical grid resolution."

We bridge that scale gap by introducing a novel fundamental-based temporal downscaling method (TDM) for translating national or regional energy scenarios to hourly emissions. Optimization-based generator dispatch is used to account for variations in emissions stemming from weather-sensitive power demands and wind and solar generation. The TDM is demonstrated by downscaling emissions from the electricity market module in the National Energy Model System. As a case study, we implement the TDM in the Virginia–Carolinas region and compare its results with traditional statistical downscaling used in the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) processing model. We find that the TDM emission profiles respond to weather and that nitrogen oxide emissions are positively correlated with conditions conducive to ozone formation. In contrast, SMOKE emission time series, which are rooted in historical operating patterns, exhibit insensitivity to weather conditions and potential biases, particularly with high renewable penetration and climate change. Relying on SMOKE profiles can also obscure variations in emission patterns across different policy scenarios, potentially downplaying their impacts on power system operations and emissions."

We also quantify contributions of different radiative feedback mechanisms to AA based on short‐term climate variability in reanalysis and model data using the Kernel‐Gregory approach. Albedo and lapse rate feedbacks are positive and comparable, with albedo feedback being the leading contributor for all AA metrics.

Cholera, an acute waterborne diarrheal disease, remains a major global health challenge. Despite being curable and preventable, it can be fatal if left untreated, especially for children. Bangladesh, a cholera‐endemic country with a high disease burden, experiences two peaks annually, during the dry pre‐monsoon spring and the wet post‐monsoon fall seasons. An early warning system for disseminating cholera risk, which has potential to reduce the disease burden, currently does not exist in Bangladesh. Such systems can raise timely awareness and allow households in rural, riverine areas like Matlab to make behavioral adjustments with water usage and around water resources to reduce contracting and transmitting cholera. Current dissemination approaches typically target local government and public health organizations; however, the vulnerable rural populations largely remain outside the information chain. Here, we develop and evaluate the accuracy of an early warning system—CholeraMap that uses high‐resolution earth observations to forecast cholera risk and disseminate geocoded risk maps directly to Matlab's population via a mobile smartphone application. Instead of relying on difficult to obtain station‐based environmental and hydroclimatological data, this study offers a new opportunity to use remote sensing data sets for designing and operating a disease early warning system. CholeraMap delivers monthly, color‐coded geospatial maps (1 km × 1 km spatial resolution) with household and community cholera risk information. Our results demonstrate that the satellite‐derived local‐scale risk model satisfactorily captured the seasonal cholera pattern for the Matlab region, and a detailed high‐resolution picture of the spatial progression of at‐risk areas during outbreak months."

 Cloud distribution significantly impacts global climate change, ecosystem health, urban environments, and satellite remote sensing observations. However, past research has primarily focused on the meteorological characteristics of clouds with limitations in scale and resolution, leading to an insufficient understanding of large-scale cloud distribution and its relationship with land surface cover and urbanization. This study investigates the cloud distribution characteristics of typical urban agglomerations in different climatic regions of China using high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and the Google Earth Engine platform. A cloud probability descriptor was constructed based on three years of high spatiotemporal resolution observations. The results revealed significant differences in cloud distribution among urban agglomerations, challenging the traditional understanding based on climate zoning. The Northeast urban agglomeration in the temperate zone exhibited high cloud coverage (37.54%), while the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration in the subtropical zone and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau urban agglomeration in the plateau climate zone had even higher average cloud probabilities (50.72% and 43.27%, respectively). The analysis suggests land surface cover, urbanization, and other surface factors may influence cloud distribution patterns. These findings emphasize the ubiquity of cloud cover and highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions among geographical factors when characterizing cloud cover diversity.

 Machine learning, especially deep learning, can outperform traditional atmospheric models in air quality assessment, offering enhanced efficiency and accuracy without relying on detailed emission inventories and atmospheric chemical mechanisms. Despite their predictive power, deep learning models often grapple with the perception of being “black boxes” due to their intricate architectures. Here, we develop an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN-attention) model that incorporates observational data, the parallelized large-eddy-simulation model (PALM), and urban morphology data for high-resolution spatial estimation of urban air quality. Our findings indicate that the CNN-attention model outperforms traditional CNN with higher accuracy and efficiency, achieving R2 = 0.987 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.15 mg/m3, while significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Compared to traditional machine learning models, the CNN exhibits higher R2 values and lower RMSE, showcasing its adeptness at capturing complex nonlinear patterns. The inclusion of attention layer further improves the model's performance by dynamically assigning attention scores to key features, enabling the model to focus on areas of critical emissions and distinctive urban features such as highways, arterial roads, intersections, and dense building clusters. This approach also reveals fluid dynamical principles, highlighting the significant disparities in pollutant concentration across roadways caused by atmospheric turbulence, and the distinct plume formations influenced by land use and topography. When applied to various urban settings, the CNN-attention model exhibits superior generalizability and transferability.

 In light of increasing climate hazards globally that pose risk to public health, the compounded effects of two major hazards, heatwaves and air pollution, have become a focal point for environmental and health research. This study explores the intricate relationship between extreme temperature events in North China (NC) and South China (SC) – two prominent areas of aerosol exposure in East Asia – and the associated changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD) across the region. The heatwave events and regional AOD distribution revealed distinct patterns in their respective regions from June to September. Both NC and SC showed reduced AOD during heatwave events, while downstream regions experienced increased AOD levels. From the perspective of heatwaves in NC and SC, we present a more holistic picture of how large-scale modulators contribute to inducing air pollution hazards across East Asia. The analysis revealed a link between blocking high-pressure system and heatwave occurrences in NC, while a dominant Rossby wave train, influenced by the South China Sea, was identified as a major modulator in SC. Additionally, other large-scale circulatory systems, such as the Western Pacific Subtropical High, the East Asian jet stream, and the South Asian High, also play crucial roles in shaping these events. This suggests the potential for predicting downstream AOD events.

To address the gaps in experimental research, phenol (Ph), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (4-HBA), and vanillin (VL) are chosen as model compounds to investigate their reaction mechanism and kinetics at the air–water (A–W) interface, on TiO2 mineral aerosols, in the gas phase, and in bulk water using a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and quantum chemical calculations. Of the compounds, Ph was the most reactive one. The occurrence percentages of Ph, 4-HBA, and VL staying at the A–W interface are ∼ 72 %, ∼ 68 %, and ∼ 73 %, respectively. As the size of (TiO2)n clusters increases, the adsorption capacity decreases until n > 4, and beyond this, the capacity remains stable. A–W interface and TiO2 clusters facilitate Ph and VL reactions initiated by the O3 and HO•, respectively. However, oxidation reactions of 4-HBA are little affected by environmental media because of its electron-withdrawing group. The O3- and HO•-initiated reaction rate constant (k) values follow the order of A–WPh > TiO2 VL > A–WVL > A–W4-HBA > TiO2 4-HBA > TiO2 Ph and TiO2 VL > A–WPh > A–WVL > TiO2 4-HBA > TiO2 Ph > A–W4-HBA, respectively. Some byproducts are more harmful than their parent compounds, so they should be given special attention. This work provides key evidence for the rapid oxidation observed in the O3/HO• + PhC experiments at the A–W interface. More importantly, differences in the oxidation of PhCs by different environmental media due to the impact of substituent groups were also identified."
10.5194/acp-24-12465-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了2005年至2021年间六氟化硫(SF6)的全球排放量及其在大气中的浓度。研究者使用反向建模的方法，结合地面、飞机和船舶观测到的SF6浓度数据，对全球SF6排放量进行了重新分析。结果表明，美国和欧盟的SF6排放量有所下降，而中国的排放量大幅增长，导致全球SF6排放量总体呈上升趋势。研究还发现，美国、欧盟和中国的国家报告都低估了各自的SF6排放量。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到大气成分分析（SF6是大气中的重要温室气体）、排放源的监测以及利用大气观测数据进行反演建模等方面。通过分析SF6在大气中的浓度分布，可以反推其排放源的强度和位置，从而为制定相应的减排政策提供科学依据。,"['sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)', 'greenhouse gas', 'atmospheric composition', 'emission', 'inverse modelling', 'atmospheric re-analysis', 'air quality monitoring']",Martin Vojta;Andreas Plach;Saurabh Annadate;Sunyoung Park;Gawon Lee;Pallav Purohit;Florian Lindl;Xin Lan;Jens Mühle;Rona L. Thompson;Andreas Stohl,A global re-analysis of regionally resolved  emissions and atmospheric mole fractions  of SF6 for the period 2005–2021,"We constrain the global emissions of the very potent greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) between 2005 and 2021. We show that SF6 emissions are decreasing in the USA and in the EU, while they are substantially growing in China, leading overall to an increasing global emission trend. The national reports for the USA, EU, and China all underestimated their SF6 emissions. However, stringent mitigation measures can successfully reduce SF6 emissions, as can be seen in the EU emission trend. 
 We determine the global emission distribution of the potent greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) for the period 2005–2021 using inverse modelling. The inversion is based on 50 d backward simulations with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM) FLEXPART and on a comprehensive observation data set of SF6 mole fractions in which we combine continuous with flask measurements sampled at fixed surface locations and observations from aircraft and ship campaigns. We use a global-distribution-based (GDB) approach to determine baseline mole fractions directly from global SF6 mole fraction fields at the termination points of the backward trajectories. We compute these fields by performing an atmospheric SF6 re-analysis, assimilating global SF6 observations into modelled global three-dimensional mole fraction fields. Our inversion results are in excellent agreement with several regional inversion studies in the USA, Europe, and China. We find that (1) annual US SF6 emissions strongly decreased from 1.25 Gg in 2005 to 0.48 Gg in 2021; however, they were on average twice as high as the reported emissions to the United Nations. (2) SF6 emissions from EU countries show an average decreasing trend of −0.006 Gg yr−1 during the period 2005 to 2021, including a substantial drop in 2018. This drop is likely a direct result of the EU's F-gas regulation 517/2014, which bans the use of SF6 for recycling magnesium die-casting alloys as of 2018 and requires leak detection systems for electrical switch gear. (3) Chinese annual emissions grew from 1.28 Gg in 2005 to 5.16 Gg in 2021, with a trend of 0.21 Gg yr−1, which is even higher than the average global total emission trend of 0.20 Gg yr−1. (4) National reports for the USA, Europe, and China all underestimated their SF6 emissions. (5) Our results indicate increasing emissions in poorly monitored areas (e.g. India, Africa, and South America); however, these results are uncertain due to weak observational constraints, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring in these areas. (6) Global total SF6 emissions are comparable to estimates in previous studies but are sensitive to a priori estimates due to the low network sensitivity in poorly monitored regions. (7) Monthly inversions indicate that SF6 emissions in the Northern Hemisphere were on average higher in summer than in winter throughout the study period."

Its multivariate analysis is applied to observed trends over 2010–2022. The recorded values show, in addition to the dominant effects of cloud occurrence, the variable effects of aerosol and geometry. Clear-sun-with-cloud situations are highlighted by SSI levels close to those of aerosol- and cloud-free situations. 
 Surface solar irradiance (SSI) is a fundamental parameter whose components (direct and diffuse) and variabilities are highly influenced by changes in atmospheric content and scene parameters. The respective importance of cloudy-sky conditions and atmospheric aerosols on SSI evolutions is region dependent and only partially quantified. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of SSI variabilities recorded in northern France, a region with extensive variability in sky conditions and aerosol loads. Through the application of automatic filtering methods to 1 min resolution SSI ground-based measurements over Lille, sky conditions are classified as clear-sky, 11 %; clear-sun-with-cloud, 22 %; and cloudy-sun situations, 67 % from 2010 to 2022, for which we analyze the statistics and variabilities in the global horizontal irradiance (GHI), beam horizontal irradiance (BHI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI). Coincident photometric measurements of aerosol properties and radiative-transfer simulations provide the means to conduct a multivariate analysis of the SSI observed trends and year-to-year evolutions and to estimate aerosol and cloud forcings under clear-sun conditions. The analysis of the record value of all-sky GHI in spring 2020 attributes 89 % of the changes to the exceptional sunlight conditions (57 % of clear-sun situations). It highlights also for that season the importance of solar zenith-angle changes, whose positive effects on clear-sun conditions surpass those due to aerosols. Our results show all-sky GHI and BHI positive trends of around +4.0 and +4.4 Wm-2yr-1, respectively, in both spring and summer, which are explained by more than 60 % by an increase in clear-sun occurrences of +1 % yr−1. Additional significant BHI increases under clear-sun conditions are mainly explained in spring by the negative trend in aerosol optical depth (−0.011 yr−1) and partly by angular effects in summer. Moreover, we find that clear-sun-with-cloud situations are frequently marked by irradiance enhancement due to clouds, with 13 % more GHI on a monthly average and 10 % additional diffuse proportion than in clear-sky situations. Under such conditions, clouds add on average 25 W m−2 of diffuse irradiance that sets the GHI at the remarkable level of pristine (aerosol-and-cloud-free) conditions or even higher, by more than +10 W m−2 in summer and for low aerosol loads. Overall, our results highlight the dominant and complex influence of cloudy conditions on SSI, which precedes or combines with that of aerosols and geometrical effects, and leads to a remarkable global level of SSI in clear-sun-with-cloud situations."

It is paramount to address and reduce the largest source of uncertainty, which stems from the representation of atmospheric transport in the models. In this study, we show that the use of a temporally varying flow-dependent atmospheric transport uncertainty can enhance the accuracy of emission estimation in an idealized experiment. 
 Atmospheric inverse modeling is the process of estimating emissions from atmospheric observations by minimizing a cost function, which includes a term describing the difference between simulated and observed concentrations. The minimization of this difference is typically limited by uncertainties in the atmospheric transport model rather than by uncertainties in the observations. In this study, we showcase how a temporally varying, flow-dependent atmospheric transport uncertainty can enhance the accuracy of emission estimation through idealized experiments using an ensemble Kalman smoother system. We use the estimation of European CH4 emissions from the in situ measurement network as an example, but we also demonstrate the additional benefits for trace gases with more localized sources, such as SF6. The uncertainty in flow-dependent transport is determined using meteorological ensemble simulations that are perturbed by physics and driven at the boundaries by an analysis ensemble from a global meteorology and a CH4 simulation. The impact of direct representation of temporally varying transport uncertainties in atmospheric inversions is then investigated in an observation system simulation experiment framework in various setups and for different flux signals. We show that the uncertainty in the transport model varies significantly in space and time and that it is generally highest during nighttime. We apply inversions using only afternoon observations, as is common practice, but also explore the option of assimilating hourly data irrespective of the hour of day using a filter based on transport uncertainty and taking into account the temporal covariances. Our findings indicate that incorporating flow-dependent uncertainties in inversion techniques leads to more accurate estimates of GHG emissions. Differences between estimated and true emissions could be reduced more effectively by 9 % to 82 %, with generally larger improvements for the SF6 inversion problem and for the more challenging setup with small flux signals."

 The age of air is an important transport diagnostic that can be derived from trace gas measurements and compared to global chemistry climate model output. We describe a new technique to calculate the age of air, measuring transport times from the Earth's surface to any location in the atmosphere based on simultaneous in situ measurements of multiple key long-lived trace gases. The primary benefits of this new technique include (1) optimized ages of air consistent with simultaneously measured SF6 and CO2; (2) age of air from the upper troposphere through the stratosphere; (3) estimates of the second moment of age spectra that have not been well constrained from measurements; and (4) flexibility to be used with measurements across multiple instruments, platforms, and decades.

Burrows;Mark Weber;Ryan Stauffer;Anne M. Thompson;Debra Kollonige,Improved convective cloud differential (CCD) tropospheric ozone from S5P-TROPOMI satellite data using local cloud fields,"CHORA, an advanced cloud convective differential technique, enhances the accuracy of tropospheric-ozone retrievals. Unlike the traditional Pacific cloud reference sector scheme, CHORA introduces a local-cloud reference sector and an alternative approach (CLCT) for precision. Analysing monthly averaged TROPOMI data from 2018 to 2022 and validating with SHADOZ ozonesonde data, CLCT outperforms other methods and so is the preferred choice, especially in future geostationary satellite missions. 
 We present the CHORA (Cloud Height Ozone Reference Algorithm) for retrieving tropospheric-ozone columns from S5P-TROPOMI (Sentinel-5 Precursor–TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument). The method uses a local-cloud reference sector (CLC – CHORA Local Cloud) to determine the stratospheric (above-cloud) column, which is subtracted from the total column in clear-sky scenes in the same zonal band to retrieve the tropospheric column. The standard CCD (convective cloud differential) approach uses cloud data from the Pacific region (CPC – CHORA Pacific Cloud) instead. An important assumption for the standard method is the zonal invariance of stratospheric ozone. The local-cloud approach is the first step to diminish this constraint in order to extend the CCD method to mid-latitudes, where stratospheric-ozone variability is larger. An iterative approach has been developed for the automatic selection of an optimal local-cloud reference sector around each retrieval grid box varying latitudinally by ± 1° and longitudinally between ± 5 and ± 50°. The optimised CLCT (CHORA Local Cloud Theil–Sen) algorithm, a follow-up from the CLC, employs a homogeneity criterion for total ozone from the cloud reference sector in order to overcome the inhomogeneities in stratospheric ozone. It directly estimates the above-cloud column ozone for a common reference altitude of 270 hPa using the Theil–Sen regression. The latter allows for the combination of the CCD method with the cloud-slicing algorithm that retrieves upper-tropospheric ozone volume mixing ratios. Monthly averaged tropospheric-column ozone (TCO) using the Pacific cloud reference sector (CPC) and the local-cloud reference sector (CLC, CLCT) has been determined over the tropics and subtropics (26° S–22° N) using TROPOMI for the time period from 2018 to 2022. The accuracy of the various methods was investigated by means of comparisons with spatially collocated NASA/GSFC SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes) measurements and the ESA TROPOMI level-2 tropospheric-ozone product. At eight out of nine tropical stations, tropospheric-ozone columns using the CLCT yield better agreement with ozonesondes than the CPC. In the tropical region (20° S–20° N), the CLCT shows a significantly lower overall mean bias and dispersion of 1 ± 7 %, outperforming both the CPC (12 ± 10 %) and CCD-ESA (22 ± 10 %). The CLCT surpasses the ESA operational product, providing more accurate tropospheric-ozone retrievals at eight out of nine stations in the tropics. For the Hilo station, with a larger stratospheric-ozone variability due to its proximity to the subtropics, the bias of +30 % (CPC) is effectively reduced to −5 % (CLCT). Similarly, in the subtropics (Reunion, Irene, Hanoi, and King's Park), the CLCT algorithm provides an overall bias and scatter of −11 ± 9 % with respect to sondes. The CLCT effectively reduces the impact of stratospheric-ozone inhomogeneity, typically at higher latitudes. These results demonstrate the advantage of the local-cloud reference sector in the subtropics. The algorithm is therefore an important basis for subsequent systematic applications in current and future missions of geostationary satellites, like GEMS (Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer, Korea), ESA Sentinel-4, and NASA TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of POllution), predominantly covering the middle latitudes."

 The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite launched in October 2017, is dedicated to monitoring the atmospheric composition associated with air quality and climate change.

The algorithm features explicit corrections for the surface reflectance anisotropy and aerosol optical effects, and uses daily high-resolution (0.25°×0.25°) a priori HCHO and NO2 profiles from the Global Earth Observing System Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) dataset. For cloud correction, a consistent approach is used for both HCHO and NO2 retrievals, where (1) the cloud fraction is re-calculated at 440 nm using the same ancillary parameters as those used in the NO2 AMF calculation, and (2) the cloud top pressure is taken from the operational FRESCO-S cloud product."

This method enhances global precipitation data and helps better understand extreme weather. 
 FengYun 3G satellite (FY-3G), China’s first precipitation measurement satellite, was launched on April 17, 2023. FY-3G carries an advanced multi-channel microwave radiance imager-rainfall measurement (MWRI-RM) system, which, compared to the previous GPM/GMI, includes more sounding channels. Additionally, a Ka/Ku-band dual-frequency precipitation measurement radar (PMR) onboard FY-3G provides 3D observations of severe precipitation systems.

Experiments showed that dual oxygen absorption sounding channels improved VPR accuracy, especially over land, reducing RMSE by 17.42 %. Including PD further enhanced accuracy, reducing RMSE by 23.54 %, while also demonstrating excellent capability in precipitation identification, achieving an F1 score of 0.904.

 Quantitative measurements of atmospheric total OH reactivity (kOH') provide crucial insights into atmospheric photochemistry. However, widespread application of total OH reactivity measurements is challenging due to insufficient equipment and the complexity of existing instrumentation. In this work, we report the development of a portable laser-flash photolysis Faraday rotation spectroscopy (LP-FRS) instrument for real-time and in-situ measurement of kOH'. To achieve efficient overlapping between the pump and probe laser and realize a long effective absorption path length, thus enabling high sensitivity measurement, a specific Herriott-type pump-probe optical multi-pass cell was designed with an overlapping factor of up to 75.4 %. The instrument’s optical box dimensions were 130 cm × 40 cm × 35 cm. The obtained efficient absorption path was ~ 28.5 m in a base length of 77.2 cm. The kOH' detection precisions of the LP-FRS instrument were 2.3 s-1 and 1.0 s-1 with averaging times of 60 s and 300 s, respectively. The kOH' measurement uncertainty was evaluated to be within 2 s-1. Field measurement was performed, and the difference between the measured kOH' and the model simulated from the measured reactive species was analysed.

In this study, we investigate the partitioning of five carbonyl compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal) during haze episodes in Beijing, China. On haze days, the values of field-derived effective Henry’s law coefficients (KHf) on aerosols for these carbonyl compounds are 106–108 M atm–1, which are significantly higher (102–104 times) than those in pure water. Sulfate is observed to have a pronounced “salting-in” effect on these carbonyl compounds, resulting in at least 1-order-of-magnitude increase in their particle-phase concentrations. Parameterization schemes for their partitioning in the ambient aerosols were provided and applied to the multiphase chemical box model (RACM2-CAPRAM). When incorporated into the field-derived parametrization, the model significantly increased hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) production by 50-fold compared to using the parameters obtained in pure water, increasing from 2.6 × 10–2 to 1.23 μg m–3 h–1. The formed HMS can facilitate sulfate formation in turn through further oxidation by OH radicals and enhance aerosol hygroscopicity. These findings indicate a positive feedback loop between the partitioning of carbonyl compounds and particulate sulfur formation during haze episodes, providing new insights for controlling particulate pollution and reducing SO2 levels in urban areas."
10.1029/2024GL111907,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了ERA5再分析资料在南极洲2米高度气温趋势方面的可靠性。文章发现，在1979年卫星观测资料稀疏之前，ERA5再分析数据与基于观测的温度重建结果相比，存在明显的南极洲增温偏差，并在三个地点发现了人为造成的温度趋势热点。这表明即使在今天，ERA5温度趋势数据也可能存在问题，但1979年以后ERA5再分析资料对气温变化的捕捉效果较好。总的来说，该研究关注的是利用卫星观测资料和再分析资料研究南极气候变化，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Air temperature', 'Satellite observations', 'Atmospheric reanalysis', 'ERA5', 'Antarctic climate change', 'Temperature trend analysis']",David H.

Global reanalyzes are widely used for investigations of Antarctic climate variability and change. The European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts 5th generation reanalysis (ERA5) is well regarded and spans 1940 to today. We investigate whether ERA5 reliably represents the 2‐m air temperature trends across the 1940–2022 (83 years) period at seasonal and annual time scales. We compare ERA5 temperatures with an observation‐based temperature reconstruction for Antarctica (RECON) that has monthly resolution for 1958–2022, the period of reliable observational availability. Results for individual stations are also examined. ERA5 anomalously warms Antarctica in relation RECON especially for the period prior to 1979 when satellite observations over the Southern Ocean were sparse. Trend hotspots that are shown to be artifacts are found at three locations and are present until today. The results demonstrate that ERA5 temperature trends can be questionable even today, but variability is well captured after 1979."

Here, the authors use simulations to show that a decline in Arctic sea ice can lead to a new multidecadal mode of surface temperatures in the Arctic Ocean. 
 Global warming is expected to be able to trigger abrupt transitions in various components of the climate system. Most studies focus on abrupt changes in the mean state of the system, while transitions in climate variability are less well understood. Here, we use multimodel simulations to show that sea-ice loss in the Arctic can trigger a critical transition in internal variability that leads to the emergence of a new climate oscillation in the Arctic Ocean. The intensified air–sea interaction due to sea-ice melt causes an oscillatory behaviour of surface temperatures on a multidecadal timescale. Our results suggest that a new mode of internal variability will emerge in the Arctic Ocean when sea ice declines below a critical threshold. Abrupt transitions in the climate system are discussed mostly in terms of mean state changes.

 The 2023–2024 El Niño has raised widespread concern in scientific and public communities. Here, using latest observational reanalysis, we show that this event matured with two distinct spatial peaks of sea surface temperature anomaly in the equatorial central and eastern Pacific, respectively. Like other double-peaked El Niños, the central Pacific sea surface temperature peaked in winter due to zonal advective and thermocline feedbacks. However, the eastern counterpart matured asynchronously in autumn and then stopped growing. This peculiar behavior results primarily from a cooling zonal advection by the anomalous westward current in the eastern Pacific during the autumn of 2023, which is associated with the local wind-driven sea surface height meridional concavity. We further propose that the relatively stronger and more eastward-displaced autumn precipitation in the Pacific intertropical convergence zone in 2023, compared to other double-peaked El Niños, is the primary cause of this distinct wind and sea surface height pattern. The 2023–2024 El Niño experienced two distinct spatial peaks of sea surface temperature anomaly in the equatorial central and eastern Pacific, with the central Pacific peak occurring in winter due to zonal advection and thermocline feedback, while the eastern counterpart matured in autumn, according to results from observational reanalysis data."

During the non-monsoon drier period, the climatologically estimated spatial mean of ET exceeds precipitation input, a phenomenon known as the soil–vegetation capacitor effect, which is pivotal in maintaining ecosystem productivity. Notably, our analysis reveals significant variations in the capacitor period between croplands and forests, with croplands exhibiting a ∼77 d longer due to dual crop seasons influenced by regional precipitation. The well-recognized hysteresis curves, observed in magnetization and soil–water characteristic curves, highlight phenomena where a system’s state is influenced by its historical inputs or states and are integral to our findings. We report a previously undocumented seasonal hysteresis in the relationship between the evaporative fraction (EVF) and SM for Indian croplands and forests. We further found that the croplands SM-EVF relation exhibits a reversal in hysteresis in the case of root-zone SM. The surface SM-EVF hysteresis is not present in forests with large root depths and reduced soil evaporation due to high canopy shading, and yet it is present for the root-zone SM. With its reversal for croplands, the newly found hysteresis must be addressed in redefining the critical SM threshold to demarcate the energy and water-limiting regimes. It should be incorporated in the land surface modeling parameterization. Additionally, we observed hysteresis in the SM-gross primary productivity relationship across both land covers and soil profiles (surface and root-zone), underscoring the need to investigate such processes to consider their dynamics in future ecological and hydrological models."

However, current land-surface models are limited in their representation of fire processes, including their ignition and spread. This study thus developed FireDL, a novel data-driven machine-learning model for the prediction of natural wildfires, and combined it with a land-surface model to better understand the impact of fire on carbon fluxes. FireDL has a two-stage deep learning structure that sequentially combines a long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm and an artificial neural network (ANN). Preliminary random forest analysis identified fire duration as an important factor in predicting the burned area. Thus, in FireDL, the LSTM algorithm was employed to predict fire occurrence and duration, utilizing lightning, vegetation, and climate datasets. Subsequently, the ANN predicted the total burned area using the LTSM-derived fire duration predictions and climate datasets as input. FireDL produced a robust performance in predicting large fires (>10 000 ha), achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.72. The daily-scaled burned area predictions derived from FireDL were integrated into the Community Land Model version 5—Biogeochemistry (CLM5-BGC) to produce CLM5-BGC-FireDL. This integration considerably improved carbon emission estimations. Notably, the total net ecosystem exchange (NEE) estimated using CLM5-BGC-FireDL in 2019, the year with the highest recorded burned area during our study, was twice that estimated using the standard CLM5-BGC. Discrepancies in the NEE can significantly influence atmospheric CO2 levels, highlighting the importance of our fire prediction model in forecasting the burned area and carbon emissions. The use of FireDL with future climate scenarios is thus anticipated to yield valuable insights into ecosystem management and climate change mitigation strategies."

 Climate change will bring about changes in meteorological and ecological factors that are currently used in global-scale models to calculate biogenic emissions. By comparing long-term datasets of biogenic compounds to modeled emissions, this work seeks to improve understanding of these models and their driving factors. We compare speciated biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) measurements at the Virginia Forest Research Laboratory located in Fluvanna County, VA, USA, for the year 2020 with emissions estimated by the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 3.2 (MEGANv3.2). The emissions were subjected to oxidation in a 0-D box model (F0AM v4.3) to generate time series of modeled concentrations. We find that default light-dependent fractions (LDFs) in the emissions model do not accurately represent observed temporal variability in regional observations. Some monoterpenes with a default light dependence are better represented using light-independent emissions throughout the year (LDFα-pinene=0, as opposed to 0.6), while others are best represented using a seasonally or temporally dependent light dependence. For example, limonene has the highest correlation between modeled and measured concentrations using an LDF =0 for January through April and roughly 0.74–0.97 in the summer months, in contrast to the default value of 0.4. The monoterpenes β-thujene, sabinene, and γ-terpinene similarly have an LDF that varies throughout the year, with light-dependent behavior in summer, while camphene and α-fenchene follow light-independent behavior throughout the year. Simulations of most compounds are consistently underpredicted in the winter months compared to observed concentrations. In contrast, day-to-day variability in the concentrations during summer months are relatively well captured using the coupled emissions–chemistry model constrained by regional concentrations of NOX and O3."

 Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesise datasets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC) are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2-products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements and Earth System Models. The sum of all sources and sinks results in the carbon budget imbalance (BIM), a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle.

After such homogenization, the data from individual satellite instruments are in good agreement. The merged aerosol extinction coefficient is computed as the median of the adjusted data from the individual instruments.The merged time series of vertically resolved monthly mean aerosol extinction coefficients at 750 nm is provided in 10° latitudinal bins from 90° S to 90° N, in the altitude range from 8.5 to 39.5 km. The time series of the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) is created via the integration of aerosol extinction profiles from the tropopause to 39.5 km; it is also provided as monthly mean data in 10° latitudinal bins. The created aerosol climate record covers the period from October 1984 until December 2023, and it is intended to be extended in the future.

 Supercooled liquid clouds are common at higher latitudes (especially over the Southern Ocean) and are critical for constraining climate projections. We take advantage of the Macquarie Island Cloud and Radiation Experiment (MICRE) to perform an analysis of observed and simulated cloud processes over the Southern Ocean in a region and season dominated by supercooled liquid clouds. Using a single-column version of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS), we compare two different cloud microphysical schemes to ground-based observations of cloud, precipitation, and radiation over a 2.5-month period (1 January–17 March 2017). Both schemes are able to reproduce aspects of the cloud and radiation observations during MICRE to within the uncertainty of the data when the thermodynamic profile is prescribed with relaxation.  There are differences in water mass and representation of reflectivity between the schemes. A sensitivity study of the cloud microphysics schemes, one a bulk one-moment scheme and the other a two-moment scheme with prediction of mass and number, indicates that several key processes create differences between the schemes. Surface radiative fluxes and total water path are highly sensitive to the formation and fall speed of precipitation. The prediction of hydrometeor number with the two-moment scheme yields a better comparison with observed reflectivity and radiative fluxes, despite predicting higher liquid water contents than observed. With the two-moment scheme, we are also able to test the sensitivity of the results to the input of liquid cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN). The cloud properties and resulting radiative effects are found to be sensitive to the CCN and IN concentrations. More CCN and IN increase liquid and ice water paths, respectively. Thus, both the dynamic environment and aerosols, integrated through the cloud microphysics, are important for properly representing Southern Ocean cloud radiative effects."

However, understanding implications for Hg cycling and ecosystems is hindered by sparse research on peatland wildfire Hg emissions. In this study, we used measurements of soil organic carbon (SOC) and Hg, burn depth, and environmental indices derived from satellite remote sensing to develop machine learning models for predicting Hg emissions from major wildfires in the permafrost peatland of the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) in southwestern Alaska. Wildfire Hg emissions during summer 2015─estimated as the product of Hg:SOC (0.38 ± 0.17 ng Hg g C1–), predicted SOC stores (mean [5th–95th] = 9.1 [5.3–11.2] kg C m–2), and burn depth (11.3 [8.2–13.9] cm)─were 556 [164–1138] kg Hg or approximately 6% of Hg emissions from wildfire activity >60°N. Modeling estimates suggest that wildfire nearly doubled summertime Hg deposition within 10 km, despite advection of more than 75% of total emissions beyond Alaska. YKD areal emissions combined with remote sensing estimates of burned area suggest that wildfire Hg emissions from northern peatlands (25.4 [14.9–33.6] Mg y–1) are an important component of the northern Hg budget.

Optimal heating for the first mode, characterized by a lower‐level anomalous anticyclone over northern Bay of Bengal (BOB), is distributed over the Arabian Sea and tropical eastern Indian Ocean (EIO)‐Maritime Continent, with cooling over the BOB‐western North Pacific. In contrast, heating over the tropical southwestern Indian Ocean and equatorial Atlantic, along with cooling over the tropical EIO‐western Pacific, optimally drives the second mode, featuring an anomalous anticyclone over central‐northern India. El Niño/Southern Oscillation indirectly influences SASM by triggering heat sources resembling these optimal patterns. Other sea surface temperatures (SSTs), like those over equatorial Atlantic, can also generate similar heating structures, causing corresponding SASM anomalies.

 Many phytoplankton produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. However, little is known about the relationship between their methane production and photosynthesis, which drives carbon sequestration in the oceans. Here, by ruling out the possibility of classical methanogenesis, we show that the bloom-forming marine microalga Emiliania huxleyi released methane during photosynthesis (did not generate it in darkness) while grown under different light levels, the amount of methane released correlated positively with photosynthetic electron transfer and carbon fixation. Under growth-saturating light, E. huxleyi produces methane at a maximal rate of about 6.6 ×10−11 μg cell−1 d−1 or 3.9 μg g−1 particulate organic carbon d−1. The microalga released up to 7 moles methane while fixing about 105 moles of carbon dioxide. Considering the higher global warming potential of methane than that of carbon dioxide and complicated processes involved in methane air-sea fluxes, the warming potential of phytoplankton methane production should be broadly evaluated.

 Runoff variability in glacierized transboundary river basins over High Mountain Asia (HMA) directly affects the stability of water supply for more than one billion people in Asia. However, limited by insufficient in-situ gauges and imprecise hydrological model output, it is still a challenge to accurately monitor and comprehensively analyze the HMA runoff change. In this paper, we construct a water budget closure test of water balance equation based on satellite gravimetry constraints to assess the accuracy of hydrological dataset outputs, and propose a multi-dataset merging method to evaluate runoff variability in ten HMA transboundary basins over the past two decades. Results show that the runoff quantified by the hydrological dataset has relatively maximum uncertainty compared to precipitation and evapotranspiration. The performance of the reconstructed terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) from hydrological dataset varies with basins, and the maximum Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) value ranges from 0.31 to 0.94. Nevertheless, the current hydrological dataset struggles to accurately reconstruct the interannual and annual variability of TWSC, with the maximum cyclostationary NSE (NSEc) value ranging from −1.07 to 0.24. Runoff change in HMA exhibits both overall stability and regional climatic condition-related spatial heterogeneity. A significant downstream change-driven increase trend of runoff occurs in Indus Basin (0.2 ± 0.1 mm/mon/yr), while Brahmaputra Basin (−0.5 ± 0.4 mm/mon/yr) and Salween Basin (−0.4 ± 0.2 mm/mon/yr) show significant runoff decrease trends driven by upstream and downstream changes, respectively. Climate change has exacerbated the instability of runoff in the arid basins over northern HMA, leading to evident increase in annual amplitude. Furthermore, negative correlation is found between temperature and runoff at the interannual scale, especially in Ganges Basin (−19.73 ± 12.53 Gt/month per °C) and Mekong Basin (−17.46 ± 9.43 Gt/month per °C). Our multi-dataset merging methodology can improve the reliability of using global hydrological datasets to quantify runoff variability in poorly in-situ gauged regions, and may also be applicable to the evaluation of precipitation and evapotranspiration."

The work shows that smoke plumes have a significant impact by increasing the low-cloud fraction, decreasing the ocean and continental surface temperature and reducing the precipitation of coastal western Africa. It also highlights the role of the ocean temperature response and its feedbacks for the September–November season. 
 The impact of biomass burning aerosols (BBA) emitted in central Africa on the tropical African climate is studied using the ocean–atmosphere global climate model CNRM-CM, including prognostic aerosols. The direct BBA forcing, cloud feedbacks (semi-direct effects), effects on surface solar radiation, atmospheric dynamics and precipitation are analysed for the 1990–2014 period. During the June–July–August (JJA) season, the CNRM-CM simulations reveal a BBA semi-direct effect exerted on low-level clouds with an increase in the cloud fraction of ∼5 %–10 % over a large part of the tropical ocean. The positive effect of BBA radiative effects on low-level clouds is found to be mainly due to the sea surface temperature response (decrease of ∼0.5 K) associated with solar heating at 700 hPa, which increases the lower-tropospheric stability. Over land, results also indicate a positive effect of BBA on the low-cloud fraction, especially for the coastal regions of Gabon and Angola, with a potentially enhanced impact in these coupled simulations that integrates the response (cooling) of the sea surface temperature (SST). In addition to the BBA radiative effect on SST, the ocean–atmosphere coupled simulations highlight that the oceanic temperature response is noticeable (about −0.2 to −0.4 K) down to ∼80 m depth in JJA between the African coast and 10° W. In parallel to low-level clouds, reductions of ∼5 %–10 % are obtained for mid-level clouds over central Africa, mainly due to BBA-induced surface cooling and lower-tropospheric heating inhibiting convection. In terms of cloud optical properties, the BBA radiative effects induced an increase in the optical depth of about ∼2–3 over the ocean south of the Equator. The result of the BBA direct effect and feedback on tropical clouds modulates the surface solar radiation over the whole of tropical Africa. The strongest surface dimming is over central Africa (∼-30 W m−2), leading to a large reduction in the continental surface temperature (by ∼1 to 2 K), but the solar radiation at the oceanic surface is also affected up to the Brazilian coast. With respect to the hydrological cycle, the CNRM-CM simulations show a negative effect on precipitation over the western African coast, with a decrease of ∼1 to 2 mm d−1. This study also highlights a persistent impact of BBA radiative effects on low-level clouds (increase in cloud fraction, liquid water content and optical depth) during the September–October–November (SON) period, mainly explained by a residual cooling of sea surface temperature over most of the tropical ocean. In SON, the effect on precipitation is mainly simulated over the Gulf of Guinea, with a reduction of ∼1 mm d−1. As for JJA, the analysis clearly highlights the important role of the slow response of the ocean in SON and confirms the need to use coupled modelling platforms to study the impact of BBA on the tropical African climate."

 Our understanding of how rapid Arctic warming and permafrost thaw affect global climate dynamics is restricted by limited spatio-temporal data coverage due to logistical challenges and the complex landscape of Arctic regions.

 The ionosphere is a layer of weakly ionized plasma bathed in Earth’s geomagnetic field extending about 50–1,500 kilometres above Earth1. The ionospheric total electron content varies in response to Earth’s space environment, interfering with Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) signals, resulting in one of the largest sources of error for position, navigation and timing services2. Networks of high-quality ground-based GNSS stations provide maps of ionospheric total electron content to correct these errors, but large spatiotemporal gaps in data from these stations mean that these maps may contain errors3. Here we demonstrate that a distributed network of noisy sensors—in the form of millions of Android phones—can fill in many of these gaps and double the measurement coverage, providing an accurate picture of the ionosphere in areas of the world underserved by conventional infrastructure. Using smartphone measurements, we resolve features such as plasma bubbles over India and South America, solar-storm-enhanced density over North America and a mid-latitude ionospheric trough over Europe. We also show that the resulting ionosphere maps can improve location accuracy, which is our primary aim.

 Terrestrial vegetation is a crucial component of Earth's biosphere, regulating global carbon and water cycles and contributing to human welfare. Despite an overall greening trend, terrestrial vegetation exhibits a significant inter-annual variability. The mechanisms driving this variability, particularly those related to climatic and anthropogenic factors, remain poorly understood, which hampers our ability to project the long-term sustainability of ecosystem services. Here, by leveraging diverse remote sensing measurements, we pinpointed 2020 as a historic landmark, registering as the greenest year in modern satellite records from 2001 to 2020. Using ensemble machine learning and Earth system models, we found this exceptional greening primarily stemmed from consistent growth in boreal and temperate vegetation, attributed to rising CO2 levels, climate warming, and reforestation efforts, alongside a transient tropical green-up linked to the enhanced rainfall. Contrary to expectations, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns had a limited impact on this global greening anomaly. Our findings highlight the resilience and dynamic nature of global vegetation in response to diverse climatic and anthropogenic influences, offering valuable insights for optimizing ecosystem management and informing climate mitigation strategies."

 The Mongolian Plateau hosts one of the world's most fragile ecosystems, characterized by high volatility and frequent natural disasters due to rapid climate change and human activities in recent decades. Frequent dust storms notably mark spring in this region. Through observational analysis and numerical modeling, this study investigates the impacts of comprehensive ocean and land processes—including sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as Eurasian land conditions—on the interannual fluctuations of spring precipitation in the Mongolian Plateau (SPMP) from 1979 to 2020. The ocean-land processes involve: a tripole pattern of North Atlantic SST anomalies triggers an eastward-propagating continental-scale wave train; Increased snow cover in Central Asia induces significant anomalous low pressure through the albedo effect; El Niño-Southern Oscillation initiate a teleconnection pattern over the upstream region of the Indian-western Pacific Ocean. These anomalous ocean and land conditions interact with large-scale atmospheric circulations, altering dynamical and hydrological conditions around the Mongolian Plateau, thereby contributing to SPMP variation. Further corroboration from numerical model experiments supports the observational analysis results. The combined effects of multiple ocean-land factors effectively explain precipitation variability across extensive areas of the Mongolian Plateau. A regression model constructed using these land-ocean factors captures the time evolution of the SPMP well."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107773,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了北美冬季气温和东北太平洋暖海温异常之间的近季节尺度关系。研究发现，暖海温事件发生的时间（早冬或隆冬）会影响北美气温的近季节尺度变化。早冬暖海温事件导致北美气温出现“冷-暖-冷”的两次反转，而隆冬暖海温事件则与北美持续的冷异常有关。这主要归因于大气环流异常，而大气环流异常部分源于东北太平洋暖海温对大气的反馈作用。研究使用了再分析数据和大气环流模式进行分析，证实了暖海温在近季节尺度气温变化中的作用，但并非主导因素。该研究与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为它利用了再分析数据（可视为卫星遥感等多种数据来源的综合结果），并通过数值模拟来研究大气环流和温度异常，这与大气环境遥感技术中的数据分析和模式模拟方法密切相关。,"['Sea surface temperature', 'Atmospheric circulation', 'Geopotential height', 'Temperature anomalies', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Reanalysis data', 'Atmospheric General Circulation Model']",Yujing Zhang;Jian Shi;Yuxin Chen;Fei Huang,Intraseasonal relationship of winter temperatures in North America and warm sea surface temperatures in the Northeast Pacific,"•For early-winter warm SSTA events in the NEP, there are two intraseasonal reversals of temperatures over North America. •For mid-winter warm SSTA events in the NEP, the North American temperatures display persistent and widespread cold anomalies. •The intraseasonal variation of temperature in North America is partly due to the feedback of warm SSTAs to the atmosphere. 
 Winter temperatures in the North America (NA) exhibit evident intraseasonal variation, which has become more pronounced under global climate change. In particular, the wintertime relationship between NA temperatures and long-lasting positive sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the Northeast Pacific (NEP), known as warm blobs, has been hotly debated in recent years. However, their relationship on intraseasonal timescales remains unclear. Using reanalysis data and an Atmospheric General Circulation Model, this study reveals that the intraseasonal variation of atmospheric circulation is the primary factor to induce intraseasonal temperature anomalies in NA after classifying warm SSTA events based on their different evolutions. Moreover, the atmospheric circulation anomalies over the mid-to-high-latitude regions are in part contributed by the feedback of NEP warm SSTAs to the atmosphere. Specifically, for early-winter warm SSTA events (peaking in November), there are two intraseasonal reversals in geopotential height anomalies over the NEP and NA, corresponding to a “cold-warm-cold” temperature change in NA. However, for mid-winter warm SSTA events (peaking in January), the atmospheric circulation pattern is relatively stable, mainly characterized by a “west high-east low” dipole, associated with persistent cold anomalies in NA. Then, the role of warm SSTAs over the NEP in the intraseasonal temperature variation is generally verified by the numerical simulations. Hence, although the NEP warm SSTAs may not be the dominant driver of the intraseasonal variations of winter NA temperatures, we emphasize the implication of their evolutionary differences in reflecting the NA temperature variations, which contributes to better predictability."

 The frequency and duration of heatwaves are rapidly increasing worldwide under the background of global warming. This trend is also observed in the mid–lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley (MLYRV), raising great public concern due to its significant impacts. This study identifies a wave train involving the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Ural blocking (UB), and an anticyclone over the MLYRV, which is closely linked to MLYRV heatwaves during 1970–2023. Our findings indicate that the development of the anticyclone over the MLYRV is associated with the energy dispersion of the UB under the regulation of the North Atlantic jet (NAJ). Further analyses reveal that the correlation of heatwave frequency with the NAO index and UB days is significantly stronger during 2001–2023 (P2) compared to 1970–2000 (P1). This strengthening may be attributable to the northeastward extension of the NAJ to northern Eurasia during P2, modulated by the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Such strong zonal winds over high latitudes of Eurasia are expected to favor low-latitude UB, and its robust downstream energy dispersion enhances the development of heatwaves during P2. In contrast, the weaker zonal winds over high latitudes of Eurasia during P1 favor high-latitude UB under the regulation of the negative phase of the AMO, and the correlation between the UB and heatwaves is less significant due to weak energy dispersion from the high-latitude UB to the MLYRV. Consequently, the UB acts as a crucial bridge within this wave train, facilitating the energy transfer necessary for heatwave formation."

Using reanalysis datasets and climate simulations, here, we show that changes in the relative amount of scattering and absorbing aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) high latitudes, manifested as long-term decreasing trends in aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA), have played an important role in driving the widening and weakening trends of the NH Hadley circulation (HC) since the early 1980s. Decreasing SSA in the NH middle and high latitudes can notably warm the troposphere there, thus reducing the equator-to-pole temperature gradient, increasing static stability in mid-latitude regions, and leading to the widening and weakening trends of NH HC. Further analysis of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) aerosol forcing–only simulations also supports the importance of SSA trends in perturbing NH HC through the above mechanism."

Twelve CMIP6 models with the most realistic atmospheric climatologies over the North Atlantic and Europe agree well with reanalyses on relationships between SIC and Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation. CMIP6 model data indicate that ESAC SIC influences the SNAO with a lead time of several weeks. However, AMIP simulations do not reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation when observed sea ice is prescribed. Rossby wave analyses do though support observed ESAC SIC influences on the SNAO. We conclude that ESAC Arctic SIC modestly influences the SNAO, and such investigations require the use of coupled models."

Since theses gases can form new particles, they can influence Arctic climate. We show that the sources of these gases are associated with changes in the Arctic environment during the year, especially with respect to sea ice. Therefore, the concentration of these gases will likely change in the future as the Arctic continues to warm. 
 In this study, we present and analyze the first continuous time series of relevant aerosol precursor vapors from the central Arctic (north of 80° N) during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. These precursor vapors include sulfuric acid (SA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), and iodic acid (IA). We use FLEXPART simulations, inverse modeling, sulfur dioxide (SO2) mixing ratios, and chlorophyll a (chl a) observations to interpret the seasonal variability in the vapor concentrations and identify dominant sources. Our results show that both natural and anthropogenic sources are relevant for the concentrations of SA in the Arctic, but anthropogenic sources associated with Arctic haze are the most prevalent. MSA concentrations are an order of magnitude higher during polar day than during polar night due to seasonal changes in biological activity. Peak MSA concentrations were observed in May, which corresponds with the timing of the annual peak in chl a concentrations north of 75° N. IA concentrations exhibit two distinct peaks during the year, namely a dominant peak in spring and a secondary peak in autumn, suggesting that seasonal IA concentrations depend on both solar radiation and sea ice conditions. In general, the seasonal cycles of SA, MSA, and IA in the central Arctic Ocean are related to sea ice conditions, and we expect that changes in the Arctic environment will affect the concentrations of these vapors in the future. The magnitude of these changes and the subsequent influence on aerosol processes remains uncertain, highlighting the need for continued observations of these precursor vapors in the Arctic."

These HCl null cycles are not affected by (1) using the most recent recommendations of chemical kinetics (compared to older recommendations), (2) accounting for dehydration in the Antarctic winter vortex, and (3) considering the observed (but unexplained) depletion of HCl in mid-winter in the Antarctic vortex throughout Antarctic winter. 
 Simulations of Antarctic chlorine and ozone chemistry in previous work show that in the core of the Antarctic vortex (16–18 km, 85–55 hPa, 390–430 K) HCl null cycles (initiated by reactions of Cl with CH4 and CH2O) are effective.  These HCl null cycles cause both HCl molar mixing ratios to remain very low throughout Antarctic winter and spring. They cause ozone-destroying chlorine (ClOx) to remain enhanced so that rapid ozone depletion proceeds.  Here we investigate the impact of the observed dehydration in Antarctica, which strongly reduces ice formation and the uptake of HNO3 from the gas phase; however the efficacy of HCl null cycles is not affected.  Moreover, also when using the observed very low HCl molar mixing ratios in Antarctic winter as an initial value, HCl null cycles are efficient in maintaining low HCl (and high ClOx) throughout winter and spring.  Further, the reaction CH3O2+ClO is important for the efficacy of the HCl null cycle initiated by the reaction CH4+Cl.  Using the current kinetic recommendations instead of earlier ones has very little impact on the simulations.  All simulations presented here for the core of the Antarctic vortex show extremely low minimum ozone values (below 50 ppb) in late September to early October in agreement with observations."

Here, we innovatively used the time-lagged ground-based aerosol size information with the fixed-lag ensemble Kalman smoother to optimize dust emission and reproduce the dust storm. This work is valuable for not only the quantification of health damage, aviation risks, and profound impacts on the Earth's system but also revealing the climatic driving force and the process of desertification. 
 A record-breaking east Asian dust storm over recent years occurred in March 2021. The Ångström exponent (AE), which measures the wavelength dependence of aerosol optical thickness (AOT), is significantly sensitive to large aerosols such as dust. Due to the lack of observations during dust storms and the accuracy of the satellite-retrieved AE depending on the instrument and retrieval algorithm, it is possible to estimate the dust storm emission using the time-lagged ground-based AE observations. In this study, the hourly AEs observed by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) are assimilated with the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) and Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to optimize simulated dust emissions from 14 to 23 March 2021. The results demonstrate that the additional inclusion of AE can optimize the size distribution of dust emissions and the associated total flux depending on the covariance between time-lagged AE observations and simulated dust emissions in each size bin. Compared to the experiment only assimilating AOT, validation by independent observations from the Skynet Observation NETwork (SONET) shows that assimilating additional AE information reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of simulated AOT and AE by approximately 17 % and 61 %, respectively. The temporal variation in both simulated AOT and AE is improved through assimilating additional AE information. The assimilation of AOT and AE also makes the magnitude and variations in aerosol vertical extinctions more comparable to the independent Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations in both westward and eastward pathways of dust transport. The optimized dust emissions in the Gobi Desert during this period is estimated to be 52.63 Tg and reached a peak value of 3837 kt h−1 at 07:00 UTC on 14 March."

These results expand our understanding of HONO photochemistry and identify crucial sources of HONO that impact the total HONO budget in Seoul, South Korea. Through this investigation, we contribute to resolving discrepancies in understanding chemical transport models, with implications for better air quality management and environmental protection in the region. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) is a main precursor of hydroxyl radicals (OH), which contribute to the formation of numerous secondary air pollutants in the troposphere. Despite its importance in atmospheric chemistry, HONO chemistry has not been fully incorporated into many chemical transport models (CTMs). Due to the lack of atmospheric HONO processes, CTM simulations often tend to underestimate atmospheric mixing ratios of HONO. This study was undertaken because simulations with the current Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model have a strong tendency to underestimate the HONO mixing ratio. In search of missing sources of atmospheric HONO, we attempted to sequentially incorporate the following potential HONO sources and processes into the CMAQ modeling framework: (i) gas-phase HONO reactions, (ii) traffic HONO emissions, (iii) soil HONO emissions, (iv) heterogeneous HONO production on the surfaces of aerosols, (v) heterogeneous HONO formation on tree leaf and building surfaces, and (vi) photolysis reactions of particulates and deposited HNO3/nitrates called “renoxification”. The simulation performances of the modified CMAQ models were then evaluated by comparing the modeled HONO mixing ratios with the HONO mixing ratios observed at the Olympic Park station in Seoul, South Korea. When HONO processes were fully added to the CMAQ model, average daily HONO mixing ratios increased from 0.06 to 1.18 ppb. The daytime HONO mixing ratios produced from the CMAQ model run with a full account of atmospheric HONO processes were found to be in better agreement with observations than those from the original CMAQ model (CMAQv5.2.1) runs with improved statistical metrics (e.g., the index of agreement (IOA) increased from 0.59 to 0.68, while the mean bias (MB) decreased dramatically from −0.57 to −0.34 ppb).

10.5194/acp-24-12623-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了2019年春季和夏季平流层入侵对中国中东部近地面臭氧的影响。研究者提出了一种可追溯性评估方法，利用环境空气质量观测、全球臭氧再分析数据和定制的拉格朗日模拟，识别出平流层入侵的关键源区。结果表明，间接入侵对对流层臭氧的影响在月尺度上更为显著，而直接入侵的影响在日尺度上更为明显。东部平原地区受平流层入侵影响最为严重，近地面臭氧超标事件频繁发生。研究还揭示了西伯利亚西部和蒙古是间接和直接平流层入侵最重要的源区，罗斯贝波和东北冷涡是重要的驱动环流系统。该研究对预测和减轻平流层入侵对中国臭氧污染的影响具有重要意义，也为应对气候变化带来的挑战做出了贡献。  研究中使用了多种大气环境遥感技术，例如地面空气质量监测数据、全球臭氧再分析数据（这部分数据可能来自卫星观测），以及拉格朗日模拟等数值模拟方法，对大气成分（臭氧）进行分析，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Tropospheric ozone', 'Stratospheric ozone', 'Ozone pollution', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'Lagrangian simulations', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Rossby waves', 'Source tracing', 'Critical source areas']",Kai Meng;Tianliang Zhao;Yongqing Bai;Ming Wu;Le Cao;Xuewei Hou;Yuehan Luo;Yongcheng Jiang,Tracing the origins of stratospheric ozone intrusions: direct vs. indirect pathways and their impacts on Central and Eastern China in spring–summer 2019,"We studied the impact of stratospheric intrusions (SIs) on tropospheric and near-surface ozone in Central and Eastern China from a stratospheric source tracing perspective. SIs contribute the most in the eastern plains, with a contribution exceeding 15 %, and have a small contribution to the west and south. Western Siberia and Mongolia are the most critical source areas for indirect and direct SIs, with the Rossby wave and northeast cold vortex being important driving circulation systems. 
 The impact of stratospheric intrusions (SIs) on Central and Eastern China (CEC) with severe ozone pollution presents a range of uncertainties, underscoring the imperative for sustained research endeavors. In this study, we propose a traceability assessment method that can derive high-resolution critical source areas (CSAs) of SIs by utilizing ambient air quality observations, global ozone (re)analysis data, and customized Lagrangian simulations. This approach enables us to facilitate a meticulous and systematic examination of the impact of direct and indirect SIs on tropospheric and near-surface ozone in six important sub-regions within the CEC during the spring and summer of 2019, as well as the unique circulations driving SIs, from a more refined and targeted tracing perspective. The findings reveal that impacts of indirect intrusions are more efficient at monthly scales, with contributions to tropospheric ozone reaching up to twice the magnitude of direct intrusions. The impacts of direct intrusions are more pronounced at daily scales, primarily occurring in May. In terms of contribution to near-surface ozone, the eastern plains frequently witness ozone exceedance events, with the most substantial impact from SIs observed (e.g., contributing 15.8 % and 16.7 % to near-surface ozone in North China and East China, respectively), showcasing a remarkable ability to capture descending lower-stratospheric air. In contrast, the Loess Plateau and Central China, situated in central and western high-altitude regions, receive more intrusive ozone into the troposphere but exhibit minimal contributions to near-surface ozone. The indirect intrusions that generate the above impact come from three to four CSAs located thousands of kilometers away, evenly distributed latitudinally within the westerlies between 40 and 70° N (spaced 70 longitudes apart). These CSAs are intricately linked to the evolution of synoptic-scale Rossby waves or subtropical westerly jets, with western Siberia or Europe and north Africa identified as the most significant CSAs. Conversely, the CSAs for direct intrusions are relatively concentrated, with those influencing the middle troposphere originating from the Tibetan Plateau and those influencing the lower troposphere predominantly located in Mongolia and central Russia, just a few hundred kilometers from the CEC. These sources are associated with typical atmospheric circulations such as the northeast cold vortex and the South Asian High, where the intensity of the intrusion system plays a more crucial role than its frequency of occurrence. This study provides valuable insights for forecasting and mitigating the impact of SIs on ozone pollution in China and contributes to addressing the broader challenges posed by climate change."
10.5194/amt-17-6517-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文介绍了一种名为ODCOD的新算法，该算法利用CALIPSO卫星搭载的CALIOP激光雷达的海洋表面反向散射数据来反演大气总柱光学厚度。与CALIOP标准反演算法不同，ODCOD能够估算包含所有颗粒物（包括云和气溶胶）的全柱光学厚度，即使在没有探测到颗粒物层的情况下也能进行估算。论文比较了ODCOD结果与其他已验证数据集（例如HSRL、MODIS和SODA）的差异，结果表明ODCOD在白天与其他数据集吻合较好，但在夜间估算值较高。ODCOD算法的提出为改进CALIPSO数据记录，验证CALIOP标准估算结果以及改进消光系数反演提供了新的可能性，这对于大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析具有重要意义。,"['Aerosol optical depth', 'CALIPSO', 'CALIOP lidar', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Ocean surface backscatter']",Robert A.

Getzewich,Total column optical depths retrieved from CALIPSO lidar ocean surface backscatter,"We introduce Ocean Derived Column Optical Depth (ODCOD), a new way to estimate column optical depths using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) measurements from the ocean surface. ODCOD estimates include contributions from particulates in the full column, which CALIOP estimates do not, making it a complement measurement to CALIOP’s standard estimates. We find that ODCOD compares well with other established data sets in the daytime but tends to estimate higher at night. 
 This paper introduces the Ocean Derived Column Optical Depth (ODCOD) algorithm. ODCOD is now being used to retrieve full-column optical depths from the 532 nm measurements acquired by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) spacecraft. ODCOD uses the lidar integrated attenuated backscatter from the ocean surface, together with collocated wind speed estimates from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), to estimate the full-column optical depths of particulates (i.e., clouds and aerosols) in the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike CALIOP's standard retrievals, which estimate optical depths only when particulate layers are detected, ODCOD retrievals deliver a comprehensive estimate that accounts for attenuation by all particulates present within the lidar profiles. This paper describes the ODCOD algorithm, develops random uncertainty estimates, and characterizes the systematic differences between ODCOD optical depths and those reported by previously validated data sets. This paper presents performance assessments of ODCOD cloud-free profiles to compare the ODCOD aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals to collocated measurements made by the airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) instruments flown by NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), to daytime estimates derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and to daytime and nighttime retrievals using the Synergized Optical Depth of Aerosols (SODA) algorithm. ODCOD AODs are biased high relative to LaRC HSRL AODs by 0.009 ± 0.043 (median ± median absolute deviation), with a correlation coefficient of 0.724, and biased low relative to MODIS by 0.009 ± 0.041, with a correlation coefficient of 0.834. Relative to SODA, which derives AOD from a combination of CALIOP and CloudSat ocean surface measurements, ODCOD is biased high in the daytime by 0.004 ± 0.035 and higher at night by 0.027 ± 0.034, with correlation coefficients of 0.887 and 0.891, respectively. Because ODCOD estimates are independent from the standard CALIOP optical depth retrievals, they offer potential for future advances in the CALIPSO data record, both in validating CALIOP's standard estimates and as a potential total column constraint to improve extinction coefficient retrievals."
10.5194/amt-17-6485-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文介绍了一种名为NitroNet的机器学习模型，该模型能够利用TROPOMI卫星观测数据预测对流层NO2浓度剖面。模型使用区域化学传输模式WRF-Chem生成的合成数据进行训练，这是首个能够预测完整对流层NO2剖面的模型。研究对模型进行了全面的验证，涵盖了全球不同地区和季节。结果表明，在夏季，NitroNet与TROPOMI卫星数据、地面观测数据和MAX-DOAS测量数据具有很高的相关性和较小的偏差；冬季表现虽然有所下降，但仍优于传统区域化学传输模型。NitroNet的独特之处在于它使用了合成模型数据进行训练，克服了以往基于实测数据模型在预测完整对流层NO2剖面方面的局限性，并避免了实测数据中存在的偏差问题。总而言之，这项研究为利用卫星遥感技术进行大气环境监测，特别是对流层NO2浓度分析提供了新的方法和工具。,"['Tropospheric NO2', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'TROPOMI', 'WRF-Chem', 'Deep learning', 'Neural network', 'NO2 profile prediction']",Leon Kuhn;Steffen Beirle;Sergey Osipov;Andrea Pozzer;Thomas Wagner,NitroNet – a machine learning model for the prediction of tropospheric NO2 profiles from TROPOMI observations,"This paper presents a new machine learning model that allows us to compute NO2 concentration profiles from satellite observations. A neural network was trained on synthetic data from the regional chemistry and transport model WRF-Chem. This is the first model of its kind. We present a thorough model validation study, covering various seasons and regions of the world. 
 We introduce NitroNet, a deep learning model for the prediction of tropospheric NO2 profiles from satellite column measurements. NitroNet is a neural network trained on synthetic NO2 profiles from the regional chemistry and transport model WRF-Chem, which was operated on a European domain for the month of May 2019. This WRF-Chem simulation was constrained by in situ and satellite measurements, which were used to optimize important simulation parameters (e.g. the boundary layer scheme). The NitroNet model receives NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and ancillary variables (meteorology, emissions, etc.) as input, from which it reproduces NO2 concentration profiles. Training of the neural network is conducted on a filtered dataset, meaning that NO2 profiles showing strong disagreement (>20 %) with colocated TROPOMI column measurements are discarded.We present a first evaluation of NitroNet over a variety of geographical and temporal domains (Europe, the US West Coast, India, and China) and different seasons. For this purpose, we validate the NO2 profiles predicted by NitroNet against satellite, in situ, and MAX-DOAS (Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) measurements. The training data were previously validated against the same datasets. During summertime, NitroNet shows small biases and strong correlations with all three datasets: a bias of +6.7 % and R=0.95 for TROPOMI NO2 VCDs, a bias of −10.5 % and R=0.75 for AirBase surface concentrations, and a bias of −34.3 % to +99.6 % with R=0.83–0.99 for MAX-DOAS measurements. In comparison to TROPOMI satellite data, NitroNet even shows significantly lower errors and stronger correlation than a direct comparison with WRF-Chem numerical results. During wintertime considerable low biases arise because the summertime/late-spring training data are not fully representative of all atmospheric wintertime characteristics (e.g. longer NO2 lifetimes). Nonetheless, the wintertime performance of NitroNet is surprisingly good and comparable to that of classic regional chemistry and transport models. NitroNet can demonstrably be used outside the geographic and temporal domain of the training data with only slight performance reductions. What makes NitroNet unique when compared to similar existing deep learning models is the inclusion of synthetic model data, which offers important benefits: due to the lack of NO2 profile measurements, models trained on empirical datasets are limited to the prediction of surface concentrations learned from in situ measurements. NitroNet, however, can predict full tropospheric NO2 profiles. Furthermore, in situ measurements of NO2 are known to suffer from biases, often larger than +20 %, due to cross-sensitivities to photooxidants, which other models trained on empirical data inevitably reproduce."

 The amount of energy reaching Earth's surface from the Sun is a quantity of high importance for the climate system and for renewable energy applications. SARAH-3 (SurfAce Radiation DAtaset Heliosat,  https://doi.org/10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/SARAH/V003, Pfeifroth et al., 2023) is a new version of a satellite-based climate data record of surface solar radiation parameters, generated and distributed by the European Organisation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF). SARAH-3 provides data from 1983 onwards, i.e. more than 4 decades of data, and has a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05°, a temporal resolution of 30 min and daily and monthly means for the region covered by the Meteosat field of view (65° W to 65° E and 65° S to 65° N). SARAH-3 consists of seven parameters: surface irradiance, direct irradiance, direct normal irradiance, sunshine duration, daylight, photosynthetically active radiation and effective cloud albedo. SARAH-3 data between 1983 and 2020 have been generated with stable input data (i.e. satellite and auxiliary data) to ensure a high temporal stability; these data are temporally extended by operational near-real-time processing – the so-called Interim Climate Data Record. The data record is suitable for various applications, from climate monitoring to renewable energy. The validation of SARAH-3 shows good accuracy (deviations of ∼ 5 W m−2 from surface reference measurements for monthly surface irradiance), stability of the data record and further improvements over its predecessor SARAH-2.1. One reason for this improved quality is the new treatment of snow-covered surfaces in the algorithm, reducing the misclassification of snow as clouds. The SARAH-3 data record reveals an increase in the surface irradiance (∼ +3 W m−2 per decade) during recent decades in Europe, in line with surface observations."

Ultrashort-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) have recently gained attention due to their prevalence in the environment and increasing environmental concerns. In this review, we established a literature database from 1990 to 2024, encompassing environmental and biological concentrations (>3,500 concentration records) of five historically overlooked ultrashort-chain PFAAs (perfluoroalkyl carboxylic and sulfonic acids with less than 4 carbons): trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), perfluoropropanoic acid (PFPrA), trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS), perfluoroethanesulfonate (PFEtS), and perfluoropropanesulfonate (PFPrS). Our data mining and analysis reveal that (1) ultrashort-chain PFAAs are globally distributed in various environments including water bodies, solid matrices, and air, with concentrations usually higher than those of longer-chain compounds; (2) TFA, the most extensively studied ultrashort-chain PFAA, shows a consistent upward trend in concentrations in surface water, rainwater, and air over the past three decades; and (3) ultrashort-chain PFAAs are present in various organisms, including plants, wildlife, and human blood, serum, and urine, with concentrations sometimes similar to those of longer-chain compounds. The current state of knowledge regarding the sources and fate of TFA and other ultrashort-chain PFAAs is also reviewed.

Mouat;Elena Spinei;Jennifer Kaiser,Informing Near-Airport Satellite NO2 Retrievals Using Pandora Sky-Scanning Observations,"Airports are a large and growing source of NOx. Tracking airport-related emissions is especially difficult, as a portion of emissions are elevated above the surface. While satellite-based NO2 observations show hot-spots near airports, near-source retrievals often have large biases related to uncertainties in the NO2 vertical distribution and resultant air mass factors (AMF). Here we use observations from UV–vis spectrometers (Pandora 1S, SciGlob) deployed near the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International airport from April 2020–May 2021 to assess the impact of aviation on NO2 vertical profiles. We show the first near-airport sky-scanning Pandora observations, which are used to distinguish the airport plume from the urban background. We find that increasing aviation leads to higher NO2 over the airport, and the enhancement is distributed across the mixed layer near-equally. We compare observed profiles with those modeled by the Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast (GEOS-CF) system. We find that modeled profiles attribute a larger portion of the column closer to the surface and underestimate the NO2 mixing height. Observed profiles typically exhibited greater NO2 concentrations up to 2.5 km above ground level. Air mass factors (AMF) calculated using observations (AMFFused) are similar over Hartsfield-Jackson to those calculated using GEOS-CF (AMFGEOS-CF). The unexpected similarity in alternative AMFs is attributed to the altitude-dependent sensitivity of AMFFused to changes in NO2 concentration. Using either AMFFused or AMFGEOS-CF to evaluate TROPOMI NO2 against independent direct-sun observations produces consistent normalized mean differences of −22% and −29%, respectively. Overall, these results demonstrate the benefits of a combined ground and satellite-based approach for probing a complex distribution of NOx emissions in an urban area."

Although total accumulated precipitation deficit during 1994–1996 drought was slightly less than in the 2013–2017 drought, 1994–1996 drought showed a record‐breaking negative SM anomalies, while the accumulated negative SM anomalies during 2013–2017 were less than half of those in 1994–1996. In 1994–1996 case, robust precipitation deficits occurred early in the event, leading to subsequent precipitation shortages under dry conditions. In addition, precipitation deficit was observed not only during wet seasons but also throughout dry seasons. This amplifies the SM response, as the runoff volume remains relatively constant despite reduced precipitation in arid soil conditions, which eventually reduces soil water retention led by the precipitation deficit. Conversely, in 2013–2017 case, precipitation deficit occurred during later period of the event and wet seasons, which leads a moderate SM drying signals."

By harnessing the multi‐spectral imagery from the FY‐4A and incorporating an attention mechanism, it significantly boosts the deep learning convolutional neural network's ability to identify typhoon cloud features and their centers, even during their initial and weakest stages, which is laudable because these are the most difficult for center fixing even for human analysts. Remarkably, it requires just a single moment satellite imagery to locate the center of typhoon, enabling automated updates of the typhoon centers in near real‐time applications."

This study concurrently measured typical biogenic and anthropogenic SOA tracers during day and night at the summit (1,690 m a.s.l.) and foot (200 m a.s.l.) of the Nanling mountains, a large subtropical forest adjacent to the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in southern China. Results revealed unexpectedly high concentrations of BSOA tracers (149.9 ± 70.5 ng m−3 at the summit and 109.7 ± 51.2 ng m−3 at the foot), surpassing those at most other background sites worldwide. Daytime BSOA tracer levels at the foot were consistent with nighttime levels, whereas the summit showed significantly higher concentrations at night. Nighttime correlations between O₃ and BSOA tracers at the summit suggest that high O₃ levels stimulate BSOA formation. Conversely, a negative correlation between O₃ and isoprene derived SOA (SOAI) tracers at the foot indicates that other oxidants may also influence SOAI formation. BSOA tracer concentrations rose significantly with the arrival of anthropogenic pollutants (e.g., SO₂ and NO₂), indicating that anthropogenic pollution amplifies BSOA formation by enhancing aerosol acidity (pH < 3). This amplification effect could be mitigated by the reduction of aerosol acidity due to increased NH₃ and relative humidity (RH). Our findings provide valuable insights into the interactions between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions on SOA formation and vertical distribution in forests surrounding megacities."

Here the authors show that this increase in boreal fire aerosols results in a positive radiative forcing, leading to additional Arctic warming. 
 The Northern Hemisphere boreal region is undergoing rapid warming, leading to an upsurge in biomass burning. Previous studies have primarily focused on greenhouse gas emissions from these fires, whereas the associated biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) have received less attention. Here we use satellite-constrained modelling to assess the radiative effect of aerosols from boreal fires on the climate in the Arctic region. We find a substantial increase in boreal BBA emissions associated with warming over the past two decades, causing pronounced positive radiative effects during Arctic summer mostly due to increased solar absorption. At a global warming level of 1 °C above current temperatures, boreal BBA emissions are projected to increase 6-fold, further warming the Arctic and potentially negating the benefits of ambitious anthropogenic black carbon mitigation. Given the high sensitivity of boreal and Arctic fires to climate change, our results underscore the increasingly relevant role of BBAs in Arctic climate. Boreal fires are expected to increase with warming, but how the aerosols emitted in these fires affect the climate is not well understood.

 Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is affected by many factors, such as source emissions, meteorological conditions, and chemical reactions. Revealing the effects of these factors on PM2.5 is essential to understand the causes of PM2.5 pollution. The machine learning method can establish the non-linear relationship between influencing factors and PM2.5. Here, a coupling model of machine learning and interpretation method was constructed to comprehensively quantify the importance of influencing factors to PM2.5 from multiple dimensions and analyze the sensitivity of influencing factors. Among the primary indicators of influencing factors, the importance of emission, meteorological conditions, and atmospheric chemical reaction to PM2.5 is 49%, 29%, and 22%, respectively. In the secondary indicator of influencing factors, the transmission effect is the most important meteorological condition, with an important degree of 15%. The liquid phase reaction is the most important atmospheric chemical reaction, with an importance of 7%.

 Over the past two decades, significant advancements in shale gas extraction technologies have led to a vast increase in oil and gas production in the Barnett Shale region of North Texas. This study provides a detailed analysis of the trends in air pollutants, such as total nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), linked to oil and gas production changes in the Barnett shale region from 2000 to 2022. The analysis spans urban (Dallas - DAL), semi-urban (Fort Worth - FWNW), and non-urban (Denton - DEN) ambient air quality monitoring sites operated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), highlighting how varying levels of urbanization and industrial activities influence air quality. DEN recorded the highest NMHC concentrations at an average of 210.27 ppb-C, significantly exceeding those at FWNW (83.14 ppb-C) and DAL (62.50 ppb-C). Alkanes were the predominant NMHCs across all sites, forming 96% at DEN, 89% at FWNW, and 67% at DAL. The i/n-pentane ratio at DEN suggests oil and gas activities as the main NMHC source, whereas DAL, and FWNW indicate substantial influences from urban traffic alongside industrial emissions.

 This study explores the impact of assimilating diverse observational data on forecasting extreme rainfall events (EREs) using a three dimensional variational (3D-Var) assimilation approach. It focuses on 38 EREs across three meteorological divisions in Karnataka, India, using a high-resolution (03-km) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with three nested domains. Five distinct experiments were conducted, including a Control experiment without assimilation, and subsequent experiments integrating observations from various sources like atmospheric profiles from Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites and radiosondes, ocean surface wind observations from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), and WindSAT satellites and buoys, ground observations from Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), as well as a combined assimilation experiment with all available observations. The accuracy of rainfall forecasts is evaluated by comparing model outputs with high-resolution telemetric rain-gauge (TRG; 6480 stations) data and other meteorological parameters against telemetric weather station (TWS; 860 stations) data from KSNDMC. Assimilation experiments show positive improvements over control experiment in predicting rainfall. Results consistently indicate underprediction of rainfall in the intricate topographical region of the Western Ghats (WG) across all experiments, contrasting with overprediction along the coastal areas of Karnataka. The experiment involving Ocean Winds showcased a substantial 40 % reduction in rainfall overprediction (above 2 mm threshold). Both Ocean Winds and Station Data assimilation notably enhanced rainfall prediction accuracy over most of the regions in Karnataka, with Ocean Winds exhibiting the highest improvement (53 %), closely followed by Station Data (50 %). Importantly, assimilating Ocean Winds and Station Data aided in reducing overprediction, while assimilating Satellite Profiles reduced underprediction in the interior part of Karnataka but increased overprediction over the coastal region compared to the control experiment. Frequency of occurrence of rainfall is considerably enhanced along the coastline in all 3D-Var experiments. Bias score indicates maximum improvement in assimilation using Ocean Winds and Station Data. Simulation of basic meteorological parameters also improved with assimilation particularly during the day hours. The results underscore the crucial role of assimilation of satellite and in-situ observations in improving forecast accuracy of EREs during the monsoon season."

America, West Africa, and the Amazon— 7%, 61 13%, 58 7%, and 61 10% of the warming observed over 1991–2020 can be attributed to global anthropogenic warming, primarily the direct effects of CO2. The remaining portion, which represents 22 8%, 21 16%, 27 9%, 23 14% of the observed warming, is attributable to regional drivers. The Mediterranean showcases high sensitivity, with regional drivers contributing 31 13% of the observed 1.2 C warming, amplifying the warming attributed to global anthropogenic drivers, estimated at 55 ± 10%. The Arctic Ocean along with the Russian-Arctic region exhibits a substantial contribution from regional drivers and local feedback mechanisms (the indirect effects of CO2) to the observed warming amplification, quantified at 43 ± 15% of the 3 ∘C warming over 1991–2020. Regional cooling drivers, however, are significant in East Asia and the Tibetan Plateau, with the latter experiencing a cooling contribution of 17%. By breaking down the contributions of climate drivers into global and regional-scale components, we gain valuable insights into the local climate mechanisms responsible for the observed regional warming, which is a crucial factor that affects agriculture, ecosystems and societies."
10.5194/acp-24-12707-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了深对流云中冰晶的单散射特性。研究人员开发了两种理想化的冰晶形状模型（高斯随机球体和droxtal），并通过组合这两种模型创建了混合模型。他们利用几何光学方法计算了这些模型的单散射特性（相函数和不对称因子），并与实测数据进行了比较。结果表明，混合模型比单一模型更能准确地模拟实测数据，这对于改进深对流云中冰晶单散射特性的计算具有重要意义。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它可以提高对云辐射特性和气候模型的模拟精度，而这些模型通常依赖于卫星观测数据来反演云的微物理特性。,"['cloud microphysics', 'ice crystals', 'deep convective clouds', 'radiative properties', 'scattering properties', 'satellite remote sensing', 'cloud properties retrieval']",Jeonggyu Kim;Sungmin Park;Greg M.

Baran;Joo Wan Cha;Kyoungmi Lee;Seoung Soo Lee;Chang Hoon Jung;Kyo-Sun Sunny Lim;Junshik Um,Improved calculation of single-scattering properties of frozen droplets and frozen-droplet aggregates observed in deep convective clouds,"We developed idealized models to represent the shapes of ice particles found in deep convective clouds and calculated their single-scattering properties. By comparing these results with in situ measurements, we discovered that a mixture of shape models matches in situ measurements more closely than single-form models or aggregate models. This finding has important implications for enhancing the simulation of single-scattering properties of ice crystals in deep convective clouds. 
 During multiple field campaigns, small quasi-spherical ice crystals, commonly referred to as frozen droplets (FDs), and their aggregates (frozen-droplet aggregates, FDAs) have been identified as the predominant habits in the upper regions of deep convective clouds (DCCs) and their associated anvils. These findings highlight the significance of FDs and FDAs for understanding the microphysics and radiative properties of DCCs. Despite the prevalence of FDs and FDAs at the tops of DCCs where they directly contribute to cloud radiative effect, the detailed single-scattering properties (e.g., scattering-phase function P11 and asymmetry parameter g) of FDs and FDAs remain highly uncertain. This uncertainty is mainly due to insufficient in situ measurements and the resolution of cloud probes, which hinder the development of idealized shape models for FDs and FDAs. In this study, two shape models, the Gaussian random sphere (GS) and droxtal (DX), are proposed as possible representations for the shapes of FDs and FDAs measured in situ. A total of 120 individual models of GSs and 129 models of DXs were generated by varying their shapes. Furthermore, by attaching these individual models in both a homogeneous and heterogeneous manner, three different types and a total of 404 models of FDAs were created: (1) aggregates of GSs; (2) aggregates of DXs; and (3) combinations of GSs and DXs, which are called habit mixtures (HMs). The P11 and g values of the developed models were calculated using a geometric optics method at a wavelength of 0.80 µm and then compared with those obtained using a polar nephelometer (PN) during the CIRCLE-2 field campaign to assess the models. Both individual-component ice crystals (i.e., either GS or DX) and homogeneous-component aggregates (i.e., either aggregates of GSs or aggregates of DXs) showed substantial differences compared with the PN measurements, whereas the P11 of the HMs was found to most accurately match the P11 measured in situ, reducing the differences to +0.87 %, +0.88 %, and −5.37 % in the forward-, lateral-, and backward-scattering regions, respectively. The g value of the HMs was found to be 0.80, which falls within the range of the PN measurement (0.78 ± 0.04). The root-mean-square error for the HM was minimized to a value of 0.0427. It was shown that the novel HMs developed in this study demonstrated better performance than in previous research where HMs were developed indirectly by weighting the calculated P11 of shape models to interpret in situ measurement. The results of this study suggest potential implications for enhancing the calculation of single-scattering properties of ice crystals in DCCs."

Beer;Ulrike Burkhardt;Anja Schmidt,Revealing dominant patterns of aerosol regimes in the lower troposphere and their evolution from preindustrial times to the future in global climate model simulations,"Aiming to understand underlying patterns and trends in aerosols, we characterize the spatial patterns and long-term evolution of lower tropospheric aerosols by clustering multiple aerosol properties from preindustrial times to the year 2050 under three SharedSocioeconomic Pathway scenarios. The results provide a clear and condensed picture of the spatial extent and distribution of aerosols for different time periods and emission scenarios. 
 Aerosols play an important role in the Earth system, but their impact on cloud properties and the resulting radiative forcing of climate remains highly uncertain. The large temporal and spatial variability of a number of aerosol properties and the choice of different “preindustrial” reference years prevent a concise understanding of their impacts on clouds and radiation. In this study, we characterize the spatial patterns and long-term evolution of lower tropospheric aerosols (in terms of regimes) by clustering multiple instead of single aerosol properties from preindustrial times to the year 2050 under three different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. The clustering is based on a combination of statistic-based machine learning algorithms and output from emissions-driven global aerosol model simulations, which do not consider the effects of climate change. Our analysis suggests that in comparison with the present-day case, lower tropospheric aerosol regimes during preindustrial times are mostly represented by regimes of comparatively clean conditions, where marked differences between the years 1750 and 1850 emerge due to the growing influence of agriculture and other anthropogenic activities in 1850. Key aspects of the spatial distribution and extent of the aerosol regimes identified in year 2050 differ compared to preindustrial and present-day conditions, with significant variations resulting from the emission scenario investigated. In 2050, the low-emission SSP1-1.9 scenario is the only scenario where the spatial distribution and extent of the aerosol regimes very closely resemble preindustrial conditions, where the similarity is greater compared to 1850 than 1750. The aerosol regimes for 2050 under SSP3-7.0 closely resemble present-day conditions, but there are some notable regional differences: developed countries tend to shift towards cleaner conditions in future, while the opposite is the case for developing countries. The aerosol regimes for 2050 under SSP2-4.5 represent an intermediate stage between preindustrial times and present-day conditions. Further analysis indicates a north–south difference in the clean background regime during preindustrial times and close resemblance of preindustrial aerosol conditions in the marine regime to present-day conditions in the Southern Hemispheric ocean. Not considering the effects of climate change is expected to cause uncertainties in the size and extent of the identified aerosol regimes but not the general regime patterns. This is due to a dominating influence of emissions rather than climate change in most cases. The approach and findings of this study can be used for designing targeted measurements of different preindustrial-like conditions and for tailored air pollution mitigation measures in specific regions."

Cede,Interpreting summertime hourly variation  of NO2 columns with implications for  geostationary satellite applications,"We investigate the hourly variation of NO2 columns and surface concentrations by applying the GEOS-Chem model to interpret aircraft and ground-based measurements over the US and Pandora sun photometer measurements over the US, Europe, and Asia. Corrections to the Pandora columns and finer model resolution improve the modeled representation of the summertime hourly variation of total NO2 columns to explain the weaker hourly variation in NO2 columns than at the surface. 
 Accurate representation of the hourly variation in the NO2-column-to-surface relationship is essential for interpreting geostationary observations of NO2 columns. Previous research indicated inconsistencies in this hourly variation. This study employs the high-performance configuration of the GEOS-Chem model (GCHP) to analyze daytime hourly NO2 total columns and surface concentrations during summer. We use measurements from globally distributed Pandora sun photometers and aircraft observations over the United States. We correct Pandora total NO2 vertical columns for (1) hourly variations in effective temperature driven by vertically resolved contributions to the total column and (2) changes in local solar time along the Pandora line of sight. These corrections increase the total NO2 columns by 5–6 × 1014 molec. cm−2 at 09:00 and 18:00  across all sites. Fine-scale simulations from GHCP (∼12 km) reduce the normalized bias (NB) against Pandora total NO2 columns from 19 % to 10 % and against aircraft measurements from 25 % to 13 % in Maryland, Texas, and Colorado. Similar reductions are observed in NO2 columns over the eastern US (17 % to 9 %), the western US (22 % to 14 %), Europe (24 % to 15 %), and Asia (29 % to 21 %) when compared to 55 km simulations. Our analysis attributes the weaker hourly variability in the total NO2 column to (1) hourly variations in column effective temperature, (2) local solar time changes along the Pandora line of sight, and (3) differences in hourly NO2 variability from different atmospheric layers, with the lowest 500 m exhibiting greater variability, while the dominant residual column above 500 m exhibits weaker variability."

 Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important greenhouse gas modified by human activities after carbon dioxide and methane. This study examines the feasibility of airborne differential absorption lidar to measure N2O concentration enhancements over agricultural, fossil fuel combustion, industrial,  and biomass burning sources. The mid-infrared spectral region, where suitably strong N2O absorption lines exist, challenges passive remote sensing by means of spectroscopy due to both low solar radiation and thermal emission. Lidar remote sensing is principally possible thanks to the laser as an independent radiation source but has not yet been realized due to technological challenges. Mid-infrared N2O absorption bands suitable for remote sensing are investigated. Simulations show that a spectral trough position between two strong N2O lines in the 4.5 µm band is the favored option. A second option exists in the 3.9 µm band at the cost of higher laser frequency stability constraints and less measurement sensitivity. Both options fulfill the N2O measurement requirements for agricultural areal or point-source emission quantification (0.5 % measurement precision, 500 m spatial resolution) with technically realizable and affordable transmitter (100 mW average laser power) and receiver (20 cm telescope) characteristics for integrated-path differential absorption lidar that measures the column concentration beneath the aircraft. The development of an airborne N2O lidar is feasible yet would benefit from progress in infrared laser transmitter and low-noise-detection technology. It will also serve as a precursor to space versions,  which are still out of reach due to the lack of space technology."

This work proposes a new process to obtain reliable data products with high coverage by reconstructing the raw data from multiple satellites. The results are validated in terms of traditional methods as well as variance maximization and demonstrate a good ability to reproduce known polluted and clean areas around the world. 
 Remote sensing based on satellites can provide long-term, consistent, and global coverage of NO2 (an important atmospheric air pollutant) as well as other trace gases. However, satellites often miss data due to factors including but not limited to clouds, surface features, and aerosols. Moreover, as one of the longest continuous observational platforms of NO2, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has suffered from missing data over certain rows since 2007, significantly reducing its spatial coverage. This work uses the OMI-based tropospheric NO2 (OMNO2) product as well as a NO2 product from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) in combination with machine learning (eXtreme Gradient Boosting – XGBoost) and spatial interpolation (data-interpolating empirical orthogonal function – DINEOF) methods to produce the 16-year global daily High Spatial–Temporal Coverage Merged tropospheric NO2 dataset (HSTCM-NO2; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10968462; Qin et al., 2024), which increases the average global spatial coverage of NO2 from 39.5 % to 99.1 %. The HSTCM-NO2 dataset is validated using upward-looking observations of NO2 (multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy – MAX-DOAS), other satellites (the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument – TROPOMI), and reanalysis products. The comparisons show that HSTCM-NO2 maintains a good correlation with the magnitudes of other observational datasets, except for under heavily polluted conditions (> 6 × 1015 molec.cm-2). This work also introduces a new validation technique to validate coherent spatial and temporal signals (empirical orthogonal function – EOF) and confirms that HSTCM-NO2 is not only consistent with the original OMNO2 data but in some parts of the world also effectively fills in missing gaps and yields a superior result when analyzing long-range atmospheric transport of NO2. The few differences are also reported to be related to areas in which the original OMNO2 signal was very low, which has been shown elsewhere but not from this perspective, further confirming that applying a minimum cutoff to retrieved NO2 data is essential. The reconstructed data product can effectively extend the utilization value of the original OMNO2 data, and the data quality of HSTCM-NO2 can meet the needs of scientific research."

This study leverages satellite data and chemistry‐transport models to analyze the impact of wildfires on trace gases in California during the August‐October periods of 2018, 2019, and 2020. During these months, Southern California experiences minimal precipitation, leading to a high Vapor Pressure Deficit, which results in decreased photosynthetic activities. This reduction, combined with increased biomass burning, causes a rise in CO2 concentrations. Increased CO and CH4 levels are also seen in TROPOMI retrievals tied to the increase in biomass burning. The CarbonTracker model captures these elevated CO2 concentrations, though with a reduced amplitude of increased CO2. Similarly, the GEOS‐Chem model successfully simulates high CO levels but underestimates the observed enhancements. These findings will improve the understanding of fire's influence on trace gases and refine future numerical models on surface emissions and transport."

We explain this cooling as due to the concurrent decline in the power of the solar wind incident on Uranus' magnetic field, which has dropped by ∼50% over the same period due to solar activity trends longer than the 11‐year solar cycle. Uranus' thermosphere appears to be more strongly governed by the solar wind than any other planet where we have assessed this coupling so far. Uranus' total auroral power may also have declined, in contrast with the power of the radio aurora that we expect has been predominantly modulated by the solar cycle. In the absence of strong local driving, planets with sufficiently large magnetospheres may also have thermospheres predominantly governed by the stellar wind, rather than stellar radiation."

These moisture advection layers were commonly observed during all seasons over our subtropical site, whereas thin supercooled liquid stratiform clouds occurred mainly in winter when the 0°C isotherm level occurred at lower altitudes. It was determined that these clouds mostly formed on the top of moisture advection layers capped by strong temperature inversions. The temperature‐moisture structure collocation (the layer's upper edge with modest/low water vapor mixing ratio of ∼2–5 g kg−1 occurred at the base of the temperature inversion) therein produced a narrow cool‐moist water saturation layer. This collocation with a temperature inversion but no moisture inversion was peculiar to the upper boundary of the moisture advection layers. A relative minority (∼33%) of thin supercooled liquid stratiform clouds formed on the bottom or middle part of the moisture advection layers, where a moisture inversion coincided with a temperature inversion. Within the corresponding water saturation layer, the relative humidity peaked at the top of the coincided moisture inversion and temperature inversion, indicating warm‐moist air mass advection.

Focusing on large‐amplitude events with large absolute momentum flux (AMF), hodograph analysis was applied to both data to estimate the wave parameters. It showed that the inertia GWs with a downward phase velocity becomes dominant in the stratosphere. Although their vertical wavelengths got shorter with altitude, their intrinsic periods and horizontal wavelengths got longer with altitude. In addition, their southward propagation was predominant in the stratosphere. Although height dependence of the estimated wave parameters is consistent with previous studies investigating inertia GWs over Syowa Station, some features specific to large‐amplitude inertia GWs were also observed. The GW features obtained from PANSY were mostly consistent with those from ERA5 except for their amplitudes. Comparison of AMF between PANSY and ERA5 indicated that ERA5 significantly underestimated the AMF by a factor of 5 between 5 and 12.5 km altitudes and more above 12.5 km. Difference of horizontal and vertical wind power spectra between PANSY and ERA5 is quantitatively consistent with the difference of AMF and its height dependence. It was found that underestimation of vertical wind spectra primarily contributed to the underestimation of AMF in ERA5. The greater underestimation of AMF in the stratosphere might be due to larger vertical grid spacing in ERA5 and the shorter vertical wavelengths of the dominant GWs in the stratosphere."
10.1038/s41561-024-01586-z,True,Nature Geoscience,这篇论文定量评估了中国清洁空气行动计划（2014-2020年）对生态系统生产力（NPP）的影响。研究发现，空气污染物（气溶胶和臭氧）的减少，通过减弱气溶胶的气候效应、减轻臭氧对植被的损害以及增强光照有效性，显著提高了中国的NPP。该研究使用了多种测量方法、过程模型和机器学习算法，量化了气溶胶减少（主要通过减少黑碳浓度增加光照和增加降水）和臭氧改善对NPP增长的贡献。结果表明，气溶胶减少和臭氧改善对NPP的提升效果显著，对中国实现碳中和具有重要意义。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为其依赖于对气溶胶和臭氧等大气成分的监测数据，这些数据很可能来自卫星观测和地面空气质量监测等遥感技术。,"['Aerosol', 'Ozone', 'Net Primary Productivity (NPP)', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observation', 'Remote sensing', 'Climate effects', 'Black carbon', 'Vegetation damage', 'Machine learning']",Hao Zhou;Xu Yue;Huibin Dai;Guannan Geng;Wenping Yuan;Jiquan Chen;Guofeng Shen;Tianyi Zhang;Jun Zhu;Hong Liao,Recovery of ecosystem productivity in China due to the Clean Air Action plan,"A quantitative assessment suggests that the reductions in aerosol and ozone levels from 2014 to 2020 due to the clean air action in China led to a substantial increase in the national net primary productivity due to the weakened aerosol climatic effects, alleviated ozone vegetation damage and enhanced light availability. 
 Severe air pollution reduces ecosystem carbon assimilation through the vegetation damaging effects of ozone and by altering the climate through aerosol effects, exacerbating global warming. In response, China implemented the Clean Air Action plan in 2013 to reduce anthropogenic emissions. Here we assess the impact of air pollution reductions due to the Clean Air Action plan on net primary productivity (NPP) in China during the period 2014–2020 using multiple measurements, process-based models and machine learning algorithms. The Clean Air Action plan led to a national NPP increase of 26.3 ± 27.9 TgC yr−1, of which 20.1 ± 10.9 TgC yr−1 is attributed to aerosol reductions, driven by both the enhanced light availability as a result of decreased black carbon concentrations and the increased precipitation caused by weakened aerosol climatic effects. The impact of ozone amelioration became more important over time, surpassing the effects of aerosol reduction by 2020, and is expected to drive future NPP recovery. Two machine learning models simulated similar NPP recoveries of 42.8 ± 26.8 TgC yr−1 and 43.4 ± 30.1 TgC yr−1. Our study highlights substantial carbon gains from controlling aerosols and surface ozone, underscoring the co-benefits of regulating air pollution for public health and carbon neutrality in China. A quantitative assessment suggests that the reductions in aerosol and ozone levels from 2014 to 2020 due to the clean air action in China led to a substantial increase in the national net primary productivity due to the weakened aerosol climatic effects, alleviated ozone vegetation damage and enhanced light availability."

 Global warming has led to a notable increase in heatwaves globally and regionally. In spring 2022, South Asia witnessed an unprecedented heatwave with temperatures breaking historical records and exceeding 5° C from climatological mean at several locations in the northern Indian subcontinent. Here, using 3D tracking, this heatwave ranked the most severe in the past 64 years, characterized by its protracted duration and wide spatial extent. The excess atmospheric heat, represented by temperature anomalies, during the mega-heatwave triggered rapid snowmelt across the snow-covered areas in the region, leading to an average loss of 42% in snow cover and 57% in snow depth of the regional snowpack. This rapid melting resulted in the complete disappearance of low-level snowpack in the western Himalayas, Pir Panjal, and Afghanistan highlands, leading to the lowest snowpack observed in the last six decades. Moreover, during the heatwave, the amount of snowfall received was only 29% of the long-term average. This combination of excessive melting and reduced snowfall culminated in a severe regional snow drought in spring 2022. The heatwave genesis lay a persistent high-pressure system over Northwest South Asia, reinforced by a quasi-stationary Rossby wave packet over Europe during the initial spell. Continuous heat from high-pressure ridges associated with circumglobal Rossby waves combined with the physical barrier of the Himalayas, lent staying power to this system during the second phase. An unprecedented heatwave in South Asia driven by a persistent high-pressure system coupled with a Rossby wave packet during spring 2022 led to an average loss of 42% in snow cover and 57% in snow depth of the regional snowpack, according to analysis of satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data."

 The conversion of tropical forests in the Amazon region for agriculture and other land uses is associated with health risks linked, for example, to air and water pollution from forest fires and agrochemical use. Several conservation policies introduced in the 2000s aimed at reducing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Here we exploit variations in the regional targeting of these policies to measure human health externalities of conservation policy enforcement using a double-difference approach at close distance to the Amazon biome border. We find that the change in deforestation pressure reduces forest fire incidence. As a consequence, fine particulate matter concentrations in the air—a main vector for adverse health effects of fire smoke—also decrease. This leads to a reduction in the hospitalization and death prevalence rate due to respiratory health problems and other health benefits for the local population.

 Northern forests are an important carbon sink, but our understanding of the driving factors is limited due to discrepancies between dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and atmospheric inversions. We show that DGVMs simulate a 50% lower sink (1.1 ± 0.5 PgC yr−1 over 2001–2021) across North America, Europe, Russia, and China compared to atmospheric inversions (2.2 ± 0.6 PgC yr−1). We explain why DGVMs underestimate the carbon sink by considering how they represent disturbance processes, specifically the overestimation of fire emissions, and the lack of robust forest demography resulting in lower forest regrowth rates than observed. We reconcile net sink estimates by using alternative disturbance-related fluxes. We estimate carbon uptake through forest regrowth by combining satellite-derived forest age and biomass maps. We calculate a regrowth flux of 1.1 ± 0.1 PgC yr−1, and combine this with satellite-derived estimates of fire emissions (0.4 ± 0.1 PgC yr−1), land-use change emissions from bookkeeping models (0.9 ± 0.2 PgC yr−1), and the DGVM-estimated sink from CO2 fertilisation, nitrogen deposition, and climate change (2.2 ± 0.9 PgC yr−1). The resulting ‘bottom-up’ net flux of 2.1 ± 0.9 PgC yr−1 agrees with atmospheric inversions. The reconciliation holds at regional scales, increasing confidence in our results.

 Aerosols from South Asia directly enhance glacier melt over the Tibetan Plateau. While the transboundary transport of aerosols from South Asia towards the Tibetan Plateau has been extensively investigated from a tropospheric perspective, less focus has been given to the stratospheric dimension. Here we examined the impact of the sudden stratospheric warming in January 2021 on aerosol transport from South Asia towards the Tibetan Plateau via numerical simulation. The results revealed that the aerosol transport from South Asia to the Tibetan Plateau reduced by 30%–40% following the January 2021 sudden stratospheric warming event. The eastward-propagating wave train stimulated by the stratospheric sudden warming induced an anticyclonic anomaly from the Persian Gulf to northern China, south of which easterly anomalies hindered the aerosol transport from South Asia to the Plateau. This study provides valuable insights for predicting air quality over the Tibetan Plateau.

Daily average PM2.5 levels ranged from 8.43 to 193.08 μg m−3, with an annual mean of 54.13 μg m−3, exceeding China's annual secondary standard of 35 μg m−3. Seasonal mean concentrations peaked in winter and were lowest in summer. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) had annual means of 4.89 μg m−3 and 0.94 μg m−3, respectively. Water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) accounted for 52.17% of PM2.5, with NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+ being the major components. The NO3−/SO42− ratio averaged 1.65, indicating a transition from coal combustion to vehicle emissions as the primary pollution source. Chemical mass reconstruction revealed that NH4NO3, (NH4)2SO4, and organic matter (OM) accounted for 65.3% of PM2.5 mass. Seasonal variations in light extinction (bext) highlighted the impact of secondary inorganic salts on visibility, with an annual average bext of 346.30 ± 246.98 Mm−1.

 Accurate precipitation estimates are quintessential for hydrologic modeling and climate studies. Different gridded precipitation products are available in any region, and selecting the best one is essential for hydroclimatic modeling and analysis. In the current study, observation- (APHRODITE), reanalysis- (IMDAA, ERA5-Land, PGF), satellite-based (IMERG, CHIRPS, PERSIANN-CDR), and hybrid (MSWEP) gridded precipitation products with different spatial and temporal resolutions are evaluated using several continuous, categorical, graphical, and interval-based performance measures towards detecting Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) events and estimating their magnitudes for the subcontinent of India, considering IMD gauge-based gridded data as reference product. We confine our analysis to the monsoon season (i.e., June to September), the principal rainy season in the Indian sub-continent. The dearth of data and limited rain gauge-based observations from non-uniform sparse monitoring networks across India necessitated grid-to-grid comparative evaluations instead of point-to-grid assessments. We propose a new ranking framework to determine the suitability of precipitation datasets for twenty-seven hydroclimatic regions comprising homogeneous rainfall zones, Köppen-Geiger climate zones, and major river basins. Results from the comprehensive evaluation suggest that (1) APHRODITE, MSWEP, and ERA5-Land best approximate precipitation event occurrences across India, (2) MSWEP and ERA5-Land are most suitable (highest rank) alternatives at the regional level, while APHRODITE is found to be next suitable dataset owing to its persistent dry bias, (3) CHIRPS and IMERG have reasonably lower rank score across India, (4) close agreement of examined datasets is noted over semi-arid and sub-humid regions (e.g., peninsular and central India), whereas ERA5-Land, IMDAA, and APHRODITE fail to detect and reproduce the intensity of the events along the west coast and northeastern India, (5) PGF and PERSIANN-CDR are the least situated datasets.

Köhler’s theory explains initial droplet growth but struggles with large particle groups. Here, we present a stochastic, analytical framework building on Köhler’s theory to account for (monodisperse) aerosols and cloud droplet interaction through competitive growth in a limited water vapor field. These interactions are modeled by sink terms, while fluctuations in supersaturation affecting droplet growth are modeled by nonlinear white noise terms. Our results identify hysteresis mechanisms in the droplet activation and deactivation processes. Our approach allows for multimodal cloud’s droplet size distributions supported by laboratory experiments, offering a different perspective on haze-to-cloud transition and small cloud formation."

Real-time indoor PM levels and nocturnal sleep parameters were monitored, followed by quantification of serum neurotransmitter metabolites and cognitive assessments in the mornings. We found that PM exposure during sleep, particularly PM1 and PM2.5, affected immediate and delayed memory, executive function, and global cognition. Reducing PM exposure during sleep resulted in improvements in multiple cognitive domains, with a 0.21 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.36) increase in global cognitive z-score, in which increased sleep oxygen saturation (SpO2) and alterations in dopamine metabolism and histidine metabolism played important roles. Notably, even when indoor PM2.5 levels were below the WHO air quality guidelines, further reducing PM exposure could still improve sleep SpO2 and neurotransmitter metabolism.

However, most of these sites are located in or near cities, leading to uncertainties in NO2 trends beyond urban regions due to limited observations. Here, we used satellite measurements to examine the differences in NO2 trends between urban and rural China. In urban areas, NO2 columns decreased by 4.0% per annum (a–1) during summer 2011–2023, consistent with bottom-up anthropogenic emission inventory and in situ measurements. In contrast, rural NO2 columns showed a slower than expected reduction (−2.6 to −0.0% a–1) during the same period. Model simulations with updates in the soil reactive oxidized nitrogen (Nr) scheme indicated that increasing soil Nr emissions can be an important factor contributing to the observed slow NO2 decrease in rural areas. This unregulated source increased summertime pollutant levels, partially offsetting the national efforts to mitigate NO2, ozone (O3), and particulate nitrate (NO3–) levels by 20.9%, 15.4%, and 4.7%, respectively, from 2011 to 2020.

 Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation multiplied by incoming sunlight (NIRvP) is important for gross primary production (GPP) estimation. While NIRvP is a useful indicator of canopy structure and solar radiation, its association with heat or moisture stress is not fully understood. Thus, this research aimed to explore the impact of air temperature (Ta) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on the NIRvP-GPP relationship. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, eddy-covariance measurements, and the Parameter–Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data, we found that NIRvP cannot fully explain the response of plant photosynthesis to Ta and VPD at both seasonal and daily scales. Therefore, we incorporated a polynomial function of Ta and an exponential function of VPD to correct its seasonal response to stress and calibrated the GPP residual via a linear function of Ta and VPD time-varying derivatives to account for its daily response to stress. Leave-one-site-out cross-validation suggested that the improvements relative to its original version were especially noteworthy under stress conditions while less significant when there was no water or heat stress across grasslands and croplands. When compared to six other GPP models, the enhanced NIRvP model consistently outperformed them or performed comparably with the best model in terms of bias, RSME, and coefficient of determinant against measurements in grasslands and croplands. Moreover, we found that parameterizing the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation term using NIRv notably improved the performance of the classic MOD17 and vegetation photosynthesis model, with an average RMSE reduction of 13 % across grasslands and croplands. Overall, this study highlights the need to consider environmental stressors for improved NIRvP-based GPP and shed light on future improvements of LUE models."

 Satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is inevitably contaminated by clouds and aerosols, causing large uncertainties in depicting the seasonal and interannual variations of terrestrial ecosystems, and potentially misrepresents their responses to climate change and climate extremes. Although various methods have been developed to reconstruct NDVI time series using the similarity in time, space or their combination, they typically require known and accurate data quality information. It is still challenging to effectively reconstruct high-quality NDVI from Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies-3rd Generation V1.2 (GIMMS-3g+), which is one of the longest observation records but lacks reliable data quality information. This study introduces an adaptive spatiotemporal tensor reconstruction algorithm that leverages the spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation to produce high-quality long-term NDVI datasets without the need of data quality information. The reconstruction process employs two different tensor completion models to satisfy the low-rank constraints. These two models can effectively remove the high-frequency noises originating from atmospheric contamination, while preserving the abrupt or low-frequency changes attributable to disturbances such as drought, even in the absence of data quality information. The resultant NDVI shows good consistency with observations from geostationary satellites. Regions that show a strong correlation (r > 0.7) with geostationary satellite NDVI increased from 46.7 % (original GIMMS-3g+) to 62.2 % and 62.3 % (two reconstructions results) for East Asia, and from 41.4 % to 58.0 % and 59.0 % for Amazon. Our method also demonstrates superior performance to traditional methods such as Whittaker, HANTS, SG-filter, and comparable performance with the state-of-the-art ST-Tensor method when the fraction of contaminated observations is low. The proposed method can also be applied to other datasets such as EVI, LAI, etc., without additional data quality inputs. The resultant vegetation index dataset has the potential to improve plant phenology retrievals and evaluation of ecosystem responses to extremes."

 The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) significantly influences global climate patterns, with one of the strongest warm phases (El Niño) occurring in 2023, altering precipitation and temperature regimes. In this study, the spatiotemporal variability in snow cover across Canadian provinces from December 2023 to February 2024 relative to long-term averages is explored. The NOAA-OISST, NOAA-CSFV2, and MODIS MOD10A1 remote sensing datasets were selected to assess the impacts of El Niño on snow cover changes and the subsequent effects on water availability, agricultural productivity, the municipal water supply, natural ecosystems, and wildfire risk in Canada. An analysis of sea surface temperature anomalies in the equatorial Pacific revealed that El Niño intensity and progression are linked to regional snow cover deviations. Compared with the long-term average, Canada’s snow cover area experienced significant declines in December 2023, January 2024, and February 2024, with decreases of 135,938 km2 (−7.43 %), 309,928 km2 (−15.26 %), and 136,406 km2 (−4.57 %), respectively. The findings indicate significant disparities among provinces, with Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba experiencing marked decreases in snow cover, whereas in Saskatchewan and Alberta, initial increases were followed by subsequent variability. In British Columbia, a late-season increase in snow was observed, whereas minor changes were noted in the Maritime provinces and Northern territories.

 This study investigates the reconstruction of climatological patterns and vegetation dynamics in the Horn of Africa region using high temporal resolution (i.e. daily) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets. The analysis compares a straight-forward processing approach to derive a daily vegetation index from a geostationary (SEVIRI) satellite with existing NDVI series from geostationary or polar-orbiting (MODIS, MetOp-AVHRR) satellites, highlighting the impact of cloud contamination on data quality in high temporal resolution datasets. Using a smoothing process designed to reconstruct the upper envelope of the vegetation status series, we obtained a daily vegetation dataset that effectively mitigated cloud-induced fluctuations, outperforming polar-orbiting (e.g. MODIS) satellite-derived dataset in capturing regional climatology. We demonstrated this through statistical analysis, including autocorrelation and mean absolute difference between consecutive observations. We showed that cloud contamination significantly affects high temporal resolution NDVI series, particularly in forest areas, which makes it difficult to identify a suitable dataset to validate our approach. Therefore, we mitigated this problem using a Maximum Value Compositing technique, designed to remove cloud-induced biases and further compared our results with another independent vegetation index at coarser temporal resolution derived from AVHRR. We found that our vegetation index closely relates with MODIS 10-day composites after removing cloud-contaminated pixels. Furthermore, the study evaluates the sensitivity of the selected NDVI datasets to drought events, demonstrating the strength of the proposed SEVIRI dataset in capturing the intensity and persistence of vegetation anomalies. In conclusion, the study presents an innovative strategy for deriving daily-resolution NDVI datasets in cloud-prone regions, validating it with independent datasets at different sub-monthly temporal scales."

 This study presents a comprehensive 5-year period assessment of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Å ngströn Exponent (AE) data from a hand-held Calitoo sun photometer on board the Ángeles Alvariño research vessel. Observations spanned March 2018 to September 2023, focusing on key maritime regions such as the Canary Islands, coasts of North Africa, the Mediterranean, Portugal, the Cantabrian, and the Bay of Biscay. The Calitoo device measures solar irradiance at three wavelengths (465, 540, and 619 nm). Uncertainty analysis for Calitoo AOD retrievals was performed using the Monte Carlo method, yielding an expanded uncertainty (UAOD) ranging between 0.008 and 0.050 with a mean and standard deviation of 0.032 ± 0.008 for the three wavelengths. Our results also highlight the remarkable calibration stability of the Calitoo (< 2.6%) over this 5-year period. Calitoo AOD values were assessed using reference AOD data from Santa Cruz de Tenerife (the Canary Islands), El Arenosillo (Huelva), and Palma de Mallorca (the Balearic Islands) AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) stations. The comparison revealed a good agreement with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.727 to 0.917 and mean bias ranging from -0.030 to -0.001. Additionally, the Calitoo AOD data were compared with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and CAMS-ECMWF (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service-European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) aerosol products obtaining that Calitoo AOD values were generally lower, showing negative mean bias of -0.063 and -0.024, respectively.The aerosol characterizations using AE vs. AOD plots in the three maritime study regions using 5-years of non-routine Calitoo data are similar to the corresponding aerosol characterizations performed with simultaneous AERONET-Cimel data.These findings underscore Calitoo’s reliability for aerosol studies in regions where AERONET instruments or other aerosol networks are unavailable. Likewise, given the low cost of Calitoo photometers, they could be deployed onboard a large number of merchant and passenger ships or in other remote or under-monitored areas, providing near real-time AOD/AE data to enhance our understanding of aerosols processes or for model or satellite assimilation/validation."

However, smoke from prescribed fires can have a significant impact on air quality. Here, using a network of fixed sites and sampling throughout an extended prescribed burning period in 2 different years, we characterize emissions and evolutions of up to 8 h of PM2.5 mass, black carbon (BC), and brown carbon (BrC) in smoke from burning of forested lands in the southeastern USA. 
 We conducted a 2-year study utilizing a network of fixed sites with sampling throughout an extended prescribed burning period to characterize the emissions and evolution of smoke from silvicultural prescribed burning at a military base in the southeastern USA. The measurement approach and an assessment of the instrument performance are described. Smoke sources, including those within and off the base, are identified, and plume ages are determined to quantify emissions and study the evolution of smoke PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters 2.5 µm or smaller) mass, black carbon (BC), and brown carbon (BrC). Over the 2021 and 2022 prescribed burning seasons (nominally January to May), we identified 64 smoke events based on high levels of PM2.5 mass, BC, BrC, and carbon monoxide (CO), of which 61 were linked to a specific burning area. Smoke transport times were estimated in two ways: using the mean wind speed and the distance between the fire and the measurement site, and from Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) back-trajectories. PM2.5 emission ratios based on ΔPM2.5 mass / ΔCO for fresh smoke (age ≤ 1 h) ranged between 0.04 and 0.18 µg m−3 ppb−1 with a mean of 0.117 µg m−3 ppb−1 (median of 0.121 µg m−3 ppb−1). Both the mean emission ratio and the variability were similar to findings from other prescribed fire studies but were lower than those from wildfires. The mean emission ratios of BC and BrC were 0.014 µg m−3 ppb−1 and 0.442 Mm−1 ppb−1, respectively. Ozone enhancements (ΔO3) were always observed in plumes detected in the afternoon. ΔPM2.5 mass / ΔCO was observed to increase with plume age in all of the ozone-enhanced plumes, suggesting photochemical secondary aerosol formation. In contrast, ΔBrC/ΔCO was not found to vary with plume ages less than 8 h during photochemically active periods."

We run sensitivity experiments with CESM2‐CAM6 (CESM2) global climate model with FIREs on (SON) and off (NOS). The model exhibits more in‐cloud liquid water content (CLWC) and droplet above the PBL in NOS, leading to larger shortwave (SW) reflectivity at the top of the atmosphere than in SON over the trade wind regions.

Meanwhile, the mean TC genesis location in the WNP exhibited a La Niña‐like northwestward shift, rarely observed in an El Niño developing year. An observational diagnosis on TC‐genesis‐related large‐scale dynamics and thermodynamics revealed that the lower/higher TC numbers in the WNP/NA were primarily attributed to an anticyclonic/cyclonic anomaly linked to trans‐basin sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropics and extratropics. Additionally, weaker intraseasonal oscillation activity compared to previous El Niños also partially contributed to fewer TCs in the WNP."

The dynamical characteristics of this event is explored by using a high‐resolution mesonet comprised of eight radar wind profilers (RWPs), surface observations, radar and satellite data. Observational analyses show the development of several cloud clusters ahead of the axis of a midlevel trough with pronounced baroclinicity, and the subsequent organization into a comma‐shaped squall system with a leading convective line over land and a trailing stratiform region moved offshore. The latter is embedded by a mesovortex with intense northerly rear inflows descending to the surface, accounting for the generation of the gusty winds. Results indicate the different roles of multi‐scale processes in accelerating the surface winds to extreme intensity. Specifically, the large‐scale baroclinic trough provides intense background rear inflows that are enhanced by the formation of the mesovortex, while moist downdrafts in the rear inflows account for the downward transport of horizontal momentum, leading to the generation of intense cold outflows and gusty winds close to the leading convective line. Despite the lack of sufficient observations for quantitative analysis, this study provides a qualitative analysis that offers valuable insights into the dynamics of extreme gusty winds.

10.1029/2024JD042002,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了北美地区极端水汽输送（IVT）与极端降水事件（EPEs）之间的传播关系。它利用1948年至2021年的NCEP/NCAR再分析数据，通过事件同步和复杂网络方法，追踪了极端IVT到EPEs的传播路径，并识别了极端IVT的主要源区。研究发现，北美不同区域的EPEs来源不同，例如美国西海岸的EPEs主要来自太平洋，而美国东南部的EPEs则来自墨西哥。研究还揭示了极端IVT传播与大气河流之间的密切关系，尤其是在秋季和冬季。总的来说，这项研究有助于深入理解大气水分输送机制和降水可预测性，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为遥感技术，特别是气象卫星观测，可以提供大范围、长时间序列的水汽和降水数据，为这类研究提供重要的观测资料。,"['atmospheric water vapor', 'precipitation', 'atmospheric rivers', 'reanalysis data', 'meteorological satellites', 'numerical weather prediction', 'extreme weather events']",Xiaodong Li;Tongtiegang Zhao,Propagations From Extreme Integrated Vapor Transport to Extreme Precipitation Events in North America,"Extreme integrated vapor transport (IVT) is a crucial driving factor of extreme precipitation events (EPEs). This paper presents a complex network‐based characterization of propagations from extreme IVT to EPEs. Specifically, the propagations are tracked from extreme IVT to EPEs by event synchronization; and then the source zones of extreme IVT contributing to EPEs are identified by two‐layer complex network. A case study is devised for North America based on the daily NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 from 1948 to 2021. Overall, eight communities of EPEs are identified: the west coast of United States (US) tend to receive substantial EPEs from the Pacific Ocean; the Gulf of Alaska tends to receive oceanic EPEs propagating inland; western Canada typically experiences large amount of out tendencies and the EPEs tend to accumulate in the Baffin Island and Labrador Peninsula; the southeastern US and the northern Great Plains tend to experience northward propagations from Mexico. Along the west coast of North America, the propagations from extreme IVT to EPEs typically originate from the eastern North Pacific between 160°W and 110°W, and make landfalls in 4 days. These propagations are influenced by anomalous cyclonic circulations developing over the Gulf of Alaska forced by eastward Rossby waves. The coincidence rate of these propagations with atmospheric rivers is, respectively, 85.31% in autumn, 91.35% in winter, 73.94% in spring, and 64.52% in summer. Overall, the observed propagations from extreme IVT to EPEs yield insights into the mechanism of atmospheric moisture transport and the predictability of precipitation."

The rich forests in the Himalayas also suffer from high incidents of forest fires in the pre‐monsoon summer months, March to June. Research studies are limited in identifying the meteorological factors governing the spatiotemporal distribution of forest fires. Using three satellite‐based data sets of monthly burned area (BA) for March to June, we found higher BA in the Eastern Himalayas (EH) compared to the Central (CH) and Western Himalayas (WH). Using statistical methods, we found Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) to be the most dominating variable controlling BA in the Himalayas. Precipitation, soil moisture and temperature, with their relative variability, control VPD that governs the interannual and intraseasonal variations of BA. Our results imply that a good forecast of VPD will facilitate alert generation for the Himalayan forest fires."

The western United States (US) is one hotspot that has experienced dramatic influences from autumn wildfires especially after 2000, but what has caused its year‐to‐year variations remains poorly understood. By analyzing observational and atmospheric reanalysis datasets, we found that the West Pacific (WP) pattern centered in the western North Pacific acted as a major climatic factor to the post‐2000 autumn wildfire activity by inducing anomalous high pressure over the western US via teleconnections with increased surface temperature, decreased precipitation, and reduced relative humidity. The WP pattern explains about one‐third of the post‐2000 years‐to‐year variance of the western US autumn wildfires. These effects were found to be much weaker in the 1980–1990s, as the active region of WP‐associated high pressure was confined to the eastern North Pacific. Such eastward shift of the WP teleconnection pattern and its resultant, enhanced influence on the weather conditions of western US autumn wildfire after 2000 are also captured by the sea surface temperature (SST)‐forced atmospheric model simulations with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6). The CAM6 ensemble‐mean changes in the WP teleconnection pattern at 2000 is about half of the observed changes, which implies that external radiative forcing and/or SST changes have played an important role in the WP pattern shift. Our results highlight a pressing need to consider the joint impacts of atmospheric internal variability and externally forced climate changes when studying the interannual variations of wildfire activity."

The decrease in European sulfate aerosols has substantial effects on the Sahel summer precipitation increase, but the corresponding effect of increased Asian sulfate is unknown. Multi‐model simulations in the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) show, compared to decreased European aerosols, that increased Asian aerosols similarly enhance the Sahel summer precipitation but with different large‐scale atmospheric circulation changes. Further analysis of the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) simulations under historical attribution and various emission scenarios reinforces the results about the climate impacts of anthropogenic aerosols and suggests that in future scenarios with strong international cooperation and rapid climate mitigations (SSP2‐45), the Sahel drought will be intensified likely due to the decline in Asian aerosol emissions. Our results suggest that Asian anthropogenic aerosols are likely a non‐negligible driver of the recent recovery in Sahel precipitation amounts."

 Different tropospheric precursor anomalies leading to sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) may result in different circulation evolution. This study finds that there are distinct differences in tropospheric circulation evolutions during SSWs following anomalously strong- (SUR-SSWs) and weak- (WUR-SSWs) Ural ridge. SUR-SSWs exhibit enhanced East Asian trough in the following week, while enhanced Greenland ridge and negative tropospheric annular mode anomalies can persist for 1 month. In contrast, WUR-SSWs exhibit surface cooling over northern Eurasia without notable tropospheric annular mode anomalies. During SUR-SSWs, waves induced by the enhanced Ural wave source tend to propagate below the tropopause, amplifying the East Asian trough. Additionally, due to decreased wave phase speed, the preexisting Ural ridge anomalies migrate westward and amplify the Greenland ridge. Before WUR-SSWs, preexisting cooling over Northeast Asia migrates westward and amplifies northern Eurasia cooling. Thus, the Ural ridge anomalies prior to SSWs significantly influence post-SSW tropospheric circulation."

 Recently, extreme heatwaves have frequently concurrently swept across Europe and East Asia, causing severe cascading socioeconomic consequences. However, the nonlinear synchronization relationship between these heatwaves and their underlying physical mechanisms remains poorly understood. Utilizing the event synchronization climate network method, atmospheric dynamic diagnostics, and numerical experiments, we revealed robust synchronization between heatwaves over Europe and East Asia, strongly associated with dry soil moisture conditions over the Tibetan Plateau from the preceding winter to summer. Dry soil moisture triggers an equivalent barotropic anticyclone north of the Tibetan Plateau, coinciding with the subtropical westerly jet waveguide and initiating circumglobal atmospheric Rossby waves propagating westward and eastward. Consequently, an equivalent barotropic anticyclone develops over Europe. These anticyclones induce simultaneous heatwaves across Europe and East Asia by increasing downward solar radiation and adiabatic sinking, amplified by positive land-atmosphere feedback. Our findings significantly enhance the understanding and predictive capabilities of these synchronous heatwaves across Eurasia."

This work was done to improve future observations of these variables at the top of the boundary layer. 
 Ground-based lidar data have proven extremely useful for profiling the convective boundary layer (CBL). Many groups have derived higher-order moments (e.g., variance, skewness, fluxes) from high-temporal-resolution lidar data using an autocovariance approach. However, these analyses are highly uncertain near the CBL top when the depth of the CBL (zi) is changing during the analysis period.  This is because the autocovariance approach is usually applied to constant height levels and the character of the eddies is changing on either side of the changing CBL top. Here, a new approach is presented wherein the autocovariance analysis is performed on a normalized height grid, with a temporally smoothed zi. Output from a large eddy simulation model demonstrates that deriving higher-order moments from time series on a normalized height grid has better agreement with the slab-averaged quantities than the moments derived from the original height grid."

 Peracetic acid (PAA, CH3C(O)OOH) is one of the most abundant organic peroxyacid in the atmosphere. PAA is often assumed to be removed by hydroxyl radical in the gas phase of troposphere, but its reaction rate is quite low. Here, we investigated the new reaction between PAA and carbonyl oxide (CH2OO) by using quantum chemical methods, reaction kinetics in combination with atmospheric modeling. We first performed W3X-L calculations close to CCSDT(Q)/CBS accuracy with the reaction systems containing eight carbon and oxygen atoms. The present findings show that the post-CCSD(T) contribution is about 0.50 kcal/mol, which is important for obtaining quantitative relative enthalpy of activation at 0 K. We find that the recrossing effect reduces the rate constant by an order of magnitude for the mechanism of the hydrogen-shift coupled carbon-oxygen addition at low temperature. The calculated results reveal that the anharmonicity increases the rate constants of CH2OO + CH3C(O)OOH by a factor of 6.27 at 298 K. The present findings uncover that the PAA + CH2OO reaction is a dominant pathway for PAA sinks in the gas phase of troposphere at the lower nighttime OH concentrations at 298 K, since the rate of PAA + CH2OO is even an order of magnitude higher than the rate of the PAA + OH reaction. Moreover, atmospheric modeling simulations unveil that CH2OO can make certain contribution to the reduction of PAA in the Amazon."

In dimictic lakes, climate change has extended the duration of summer thermal stratification and reduced the length of the ice season. These changes are relatively straightforward to evaluate in smaller, inland lakes. However, in large lakes, such as the North American Great Lakes, temporally intermittent and spatially heterogeneous ice cover, and spatial thermal heterogeneity limit the utility of simple ice on–off or mixing classifications; therefore, assessing how climate change is impacting winter conditions in large lakes is challenging. Here, we use in-situ and satellite-derived surface water temperature observations from the North American Great Lakes to overcome these limitations and show that warming air temperatures are driving reductions in the number of winter days, collectively those with either ice cover or inverse thermal stratification, in favor of increases in isothermal conditions for the period 1995–2023. We find that on average the Great Lakes are experiencing a loss of 14 winter days per decade. Our results demonstrate how climate change has yielded disproportionate changes in the annual thermal cycle and mixing conditions of Earth’s largest freshwater system and signals the potential for fundamental ecosystem shifts due to a loss of winter."

These initiatives are generally limited by a lack of relevant data on forest carbon stocks and fluxes past-to-future. Previously, we developed a new forest carbon modeling system that combined high-resolution remote sensing, field data, and ecological modeling to estimate contemporary above-ground forest carbon stocks, and projected future forest carbon sequestration potential for the state of Maryland. Here we extended this work to provide a consistent geospatial approach for monitoring changes in forest carbon stocks over time. Utilizing the same data and modeling system developed previously for planning, we integrated historical input data on weather and disturbance to reconstruct the history of vegetation dynamics and forest above-ground carbon stocks annually over the period 1984–2016 at 30 m resolution and provided an extension to 2023. Statewide, forested land had an average annual net above ground carbon sink of 1.37 TgC yr−1, comparable to prior estimates. However, unlike the prior estimates, there was considerable variation around this mean. The statewide net above ground flux ranged interannually from −0.65 to 2.77 Tg C yr−1. At the county scale, the average annual net above ground flux ranged spatially from 0.01 to 0.13 Tg C yr−1 and spatiotemporally from −0.43 to 0.24 Tg C yr−1. Attribution analyses indicate the primary importance of persistent and regrowing forests, vegetation structure, local disturbance, and rising CO2 to the mean flux, and the primary importance of weather to the large-scale interannual variability. These results have important implications for state climate mitigation planning, reporting and assessment. With this approach, it is now possible to monitor changes in forest carbon stocks spatiotemporally over policy relevant domains with a consistent framework that is also enabled for future planning."

 Marine cold-air outbreaks (MCAOs) strongly affect the Arctic water cycle and, thus, climate through large-scale air mass transformations. The description of air mass transformations is still challenging, partly because previous observations do not resolve fine scales, particularly for the initial development of an MCAO, and due to a lack of information about the thermodynamical evolution starting over sea ice and continuing over open ocean and associated cloud microphysical properties. Therefore, we focus on the crucial initial development within the first 200 km over open water for two case studies in April 2022 during the HALO-(AC)3 campaign (named after the High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft and Transregional Collaborative Research Centre ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3). The two events, just 3 d apart, belong to a particularly long-lasting MCAO and occurred under relatively similar thermodynamic conditions. Even though both events were stronger than the climatological 75th percentile of that period, the first event was characterized by colder air masses from the central Arctic which led to an MCAO index twice as high compared to that of the second event.The evolution and structure were assessed by flight legs crossing the Fram Strait multiple times at the same location, sampling perpendicularly to the cloud streets. Airborne remote sensing and in situ measurements were used to build statistical descriptions of the boundary layer, dynamics, clouds, and precipitation. For this purpose, we established a novel approach based solely on radar reflectivity measurements to detect roll circulation that forms cloud streets. The two cases exhibit different properties of clouds, riming, and roll circulations, though the width of the roll circulation is similar. For the stronger event, cloud tops are higher; more liquid-topped clouds exist; the liquid water path, mean radar reflectivity, precipitation rate, and precipitation occurrence have increased; and riming is active. The variability in rime mass has the same horizontal scale as the roll circulation, implying the importance of roll circulation on cloud microphysics and precipitation.Boundary layer and cloud properties evolve with distance over open water, as seen by, e.g., cloud top height rising. In general, cloud streets form after traveling 15 km over open water. After 20 km, this formation enhances cloud cover to just below 100 %. After around 30 km, precipitation forms, though for the weaker event, the development of precipitation is shifted to larger distances. Within our analysis, we developed statistical descriptions of various parameters (i) within the roll circulation and (ii) as a function of distance over open water. These detailed cloud metrics are particularly well suited for the evaluation of cloud-resolving models close to the sea ice edge to evaluate their representation of dynamics and microphysics."

However, knowledge of the interactions of different indoor pollutants is limited. We investigated physicochemical properties of SOA generated from typical indoor chemistry of the O3/α-pinene reaction with and without the presence of particles and gases from a burning candle. Ozonolysis of α-pinene in the presence of candle gaseous emissions yielded a considerably lower particle number, larger particle sizes, and lower particle oxygen-to-carbon ratio compared with experiments without candle emissions. More nitrogen-containing organic compounds were observed in the aerosol phase with candle emissions. Furthermore, concentrations of some typical particle-phase products from the O3/α-pinene reaction (i.e., terebic acid, cis-pinic acid, and 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid) were less abundant in the presence of candle emissions. The predicted volatility of particulate organic compounds was higher in experiments with candle emissions. The study demonstrates that candle burning can affect the chemical and physical properties of particles formed from other sources (e.g., α-pinene ozonolysis) by affecting gas-phase chemistry and gas-particle partitioning."

Previously detected SOA-markers in northern hemisphere ice cores from Alaska, Greenland, Russia, and Switzerland indicate the transportation of isoprene and monoterpene oxidation products from their forestry sources to these glacial regions. Antarctica is geographically further removed from the BVOC’s source, indicating significantly lower SOA-marker concentrations are likely in southern hemisphere ice cores. The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive mass-spectrometric method to detect and quantify low-abundance SOA-markers of isoprene and monoterpenes in ice core samples. Employment of a triple quadrupole HPLC–MS method enabled limit of detections in the range of 0.4–10 ppt for nine terrestrial SOA-markers and a marker of biomass burning, levoglucosan. Quantification was conducted in the multiple reaction monitoring mode with two specific transitions monitored for each target compound. Application of the developed method onto a section of a Jurassic ice core from Antarctica revealed the presence of seven of the target compounds: 2-methylerythritol, 2-methylglyceric acid, cis-pinonic acid, 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid, pinolic acid, cis-norpinonic acid, and pinic acid.

The infrared window region (780–1,250 cm−1, 12.8 to 8.0 μm) is of great importance to Earth's climate due to its high transparency and thermal energy. We present here a new investigation of the transparency of this spectral region based on observations by interferometers of downwelling surface radiance at two DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program sites. We focus on the dominant source of absorption in this region, the water vapor continuum, and derive updated values of spectral absorption coefficients for both the self and foreign continua. Our results show that the self continuum is too strong in the previous version of Mlawer‐Tobin_Clough‐Kneizys‐Davies (MT_CKD) water vapor continuum model, a result that is consistent with other recent analyses, while the foreign continuum is too weak in MT_CKD. In general, the weaker self continuum derived in this study results in an overall increase in atmospheric transparency in the window, although in atmospheres with low amounts of water vapor the transparency may slightly decrease due to the increase in foreign continuum absorption. These continuum changes lead to a significant decrease in downwelling longwave flux at the surface for moist atmospheres and a modest increase in outgoing longwave radiation. The increased fraction of surface‐leaving radiation that escapes to space leads to a notable increase (∼5–10%) in climate feedback, implying that climate simulations that use the new infrared window continuum will show somewhat less warming than before. This study also points out the possibly important role that aerosol absorption may play in the longwave radiative budget."
10.1029/2024JD041833,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了全球范围内极端对流有效位能 (CAPE) 的起源。CAPE 是衡量大气不稳定程度的重要指标，与强对流天气（如龙卷风、暴雨和冰雹）的发生密切相关。研究使用了拉格朗日方法，分析了2012年至2013年期间不同地区极端CAPE值的形成过程。结果表明，虽然几乎所有极端CAPE值都源于对流抑制层 (CIN) 下的表面通量在多个昼夜循环中的积累，但CIN层的起源和表面通量的昼夜变化在全球各地存在差异。例如，在北美和欧洲，需要比通常情况下更高的上层大气温度才能形成CIN层；而在中东和非洲中部，CIN层则较为常见。此外，陆地上的高CAPE事件（美洲、欧洲、非洲和东南亚）往往在CAPE达到最大值之前由于明显的感热加热而失去CIN层，而发生在沿海地区（中东、澳大利亚北部、南亚和地中海）的高CAPE事件通常会保留相当大的对流抑制。东南澳大利亚的CAPE积累则独特地源于高空冷却而非边界层增温。这项研究强调了理解和预测CAPE模式需要考虑不同地区多种机制的必要性。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为对CAPE的观测和分析需要依赖于气象卫星、探空仪等遥感手段获取的大气数据，例如温度、湿度、风场等信息，从而进行大气不稳定性分析和强对流天气预报。,"['Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)', 'Atmospheric Instability', 'Severe Convection', 'Satellite Meteorology', 'Remote Sensing', 'Weather Forecasting', 'Diurnal Cycle', 'Boundary Layer Meteorology']",P. J. Tuckman;Kerry Emanuel,Origins of Extreme CAPE Around the World,"Severe convection, responsible for hazards such as tornadoes, flash floods, and hail, is usually preceded by abundant convective available potential energy (CAPE). In this work, we use a Lagrangian approach to study the buildup of anomalously large values of CAPE from 2012 to 2013 in various regions. Nearly all extreme values of CAPE arise from surface fluxes underneath a layer of convective inhibition (the CIN layer) over several diurnal cycles, but the origin of the CIN layer and the diurnal cycle of surface fluxes differ around the world. In some regions, such as North America and Europe, the air above the boundary layer must be much warmer than usual to form this CIN layer, whereas in other regions, especially the Middle East and central Africa, a CIN layer is common. Additionally, high CAPE occurrences that are over land (those in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia) tend to lose their CIN layers before the time of maximum CAPE due to large diurnal cycles of sensible heating, whereas those that occur over coastal waters (in the Middle East, Northern Australia, South Asia, and the Mediterranean) usually retain substantial convective inhibition. Uniquely, CAPE in Southeast Australia often builds up due to cooling aloft rather than to boundary layer warming. These results show that one hoping to understand or predict CAPE patterns must understand a variety of mechanisms acting in different regions."

Bowman;Anita D. Rapp,Environmental Controls on Deep and Overshooting Convection Over the Contiguous U.S.,"During the summer season, deep convection over the central United States has a significant impact on the dynamics and composition of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). These storms transport tropospheric air containing trace gases, ice particles, and aerosols into the UTLS, which can affect chemical and radiative processes over a large region. Because overshooting storms necessarily have strong updrafts, there is a marked correlation between overshooting and the occurrence of severe weather at the surface. Heat released by these storms also helps to drive the North American Monsoon Anticyclone (NAMA) in the UTLS, which partially confines air injected into the stratosphere by overshooting storms. In support of the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) project, this study is a climatological analysis of the environmental factors that affect the occurrence of deep and overshooting storms. Using hourly analyses of overshooting storms based on GridRad radar data and ERA5 reanalyzes, we focus on the roles of convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), jet location, and other relevant dynamical and thermodynamic variables. The results show that northward intrusion of airmasses containing moist high CAPE air from the Gulf of Mexico into the central plains plays a major role in producing the conditions necessary for overshooting storms with other factors playing secondary roles."

 Over the last four decades (1980–2020), the summer westerlies that prevail in South Asia along the monsoon trough region have weakened by about 25% based on multiple reanalysis datasets. Trends in a range of climate model simulations suggest that the weakening is driven by multiple anthropogenic forcings. Over the period, sea-level pressure has increased by 0.6–1.0 hPa over South Asia’s northwestern regions, induced by cooling due to aerosol emission and changes in land use and land cover, and has decreased over the Arabian Peninsula mainly due to warming by greenhouse gases. These changes in temperature and pressure act to weaken the regional pressure gradient, deflecting the subtropical westerlies from South Asia toward the Arabian Peninsula and weakening the winds in the monsoon trough and its adjacent region. The slowing down of winds appears to result in an anomalous moisture loading and increase in rainfall over the semi-arid northwestern South Asia. This weakening and its associated changes in regional climate are highly relevant to policymaking across South Asia."

 Satellite-based measurements have emerged as an effective method for the top-down estimates of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Changes in the column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) in the atmosphere reflect contributions from both human activities and natural processes, posing challenges in accurately extracting anthropogenic XCO2 signals and quantifying urban CO2 emissions. Here, we introduce a novel method based on spatial autocorrelation to directly identify anthropogenic XCO2 signals from satellite measurements of Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). These signals serve as constraints for atmospheric transport model simulations, enabling the verification of emission inventory over urban areas. Utilizing 35 OCO-2 overpasses over the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, we demonstrate the effectiveness of local Moran's I statistics in detecting localized anthropogenic XCO2 enhancements. The results show an average XCO2 increase of 1.36–4.41 ppm in proximity to major cities and areas with intensive industrial activity. A case study near Nanjing, based on eight overpasses, reveals XCO2 enhancements with peaks ranging from 2.26 to 4.72 ppm. To establish the relationship between these XCO2 enhancements and CO2 emissions, we conducted WRF-Chem simulations driven by emissions from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). Discrepancies between observed and simulated XCO2 enhancements were primarily attributed to uncertainties in the prior emissions, the calculation of urban XCO2 enhancements from OCO-2 data, and complex atmospheric transport dynamics. From our estimates, the daily CO2 emissions in Nanjing is 0.65 ± 0.15 MtCO2/day, which is different from the EDGAR inventory by −10.5 % to 77.3 % (i.e., 0.17 ± 0.14 MtCO2 /day). Error analysis suggests an uncertainty in CO2 emission estimates associated with XCO2 enhancement and wind speed ranging from 16 % to 32 % (i.e., 0.08–0.15 MtCO2/day). This study proposes an objective approach to assess urban CO2 emissions, leveraging satellite XCO2 observations to improve accuracy and reliability in emission inventories."

 This paper analyzes the four severe cooling events in Changchun, Northeast China, in January for selected years. The events in the absence of sudden stratospheric warmings were chosen. This excludes the possible effects of warm stratospheric anomalies in the polar vortex region, which may affect midlatitudes. The meridional profiles and maps for the coldest and warmest days of January are compared using the temperature and ozone data from observations and reanalysis. Based on the vertical temperature structure compared to the coldest–warmest days, the lower stratosphere–surface thermal coupling was analyzed, which has not been studied previously. It has been shown that (i) temperature increase by 5–10 °C in the lower stratosphere, (ii) lowering the tropopause by about 2–3 km, (iii) pushing the cold midtropospheric layer from climatological about 3 km to the surface with formation of the midlatitude temperature minimum, and (iv) a decrease in surface temperature in Changchun by 15–24 °C, concurrently occurred on the coldest days compared to the warmest days. Cold air in the region of the midlatitude minimum temperature, merging with the cold air of higher latitudes, contributes to the formation of the cold air outbreak pattern. The main elements of stratospheric and tropospheric dynamics (quasi-stationary and traveling planetary waves, zonally asymmetric Brewer–Dobson circulation, deformation of the tropopause and tropospheric isotherms) involved in extreme cooling events are analyzed. Because of the positive correlation between total ozone and temperature in the lower stratosphere, extremely high total ozone over the midlatitude region may serve as an indicator of warm stratospheric anomaly and possible downward thermal forcing."

 Bromine radicals released from sea ice, snow, and marine sources play a critical role in the atmospheric chemistry of polar regions. The Chemical and Mesoscale Mechanisms of Polar Cell Aerosol Nucleation (CAMMPCAN) ship campaign conducted in coastal East Antarctica over two 6-month periods in 2017–18 and 2018–19 provides a unique dataset to identify the environmental drivers of bromine variability in Antarctic spring and summer. In this study, we used CAMMPCAN chemical and meteorological observations combined with reanalysis data from the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and satellite-based sea ice data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center to select variables that showed statistically significant correlation with bromine monoxide (BrO) partial columns measured during CAMMPCAN. We then used those variables in principal component analysis and subsequent principal component regression to identify dominant modes of Antarctic environmental variability and their impacts on lower tropospheric BrO. Comparing our three dominant Antarctic principal components to those from a similar analysis conducted previously for the Arctic (Swanson et al., 2020), we found only one mode with clear overlap, representing a vertical mixing mode in which low-pressure systems mix BrO and its precursors into the lower troposphere. We also identified an Antarctic mode describing conditions favourable for blowing snow, similar to the combined effect of two modes from the Arctic analysis but more clearly disambiguated here due to the inclusion of sea ice data in our analysis. The third Antarctic mode, attributed to an ocean source (biological activity and/or sea salt aerosol), was particularly important in summer. The principal component regression model developed from these modes showed moderate skill in predicting BrO partial columns in the lowest 2 km of the troposphere (R = 0.51), a significant improvement over the Arctic-based regression model (R = 0.08). Neither model could reproduce the observed variability in BrO in the lowest 200 m. Finally, we applied the same analysis to coincident CAMMPCAN observations of gaseous elemental mercury and found regression of our three dominant modes could explain nearly 50% of observed mercury variability (R = 0.69). Our results reinforce the importance of sea ice and ocean processes in bromine cycling in coastal East Antarctica and highlight the need to consider Antarctic-specific processes in mechanistic models of atmospheric bromine chemistry."

 Tropospheric ozone is a secondary air pollutant with a photochemical origin, commonly resulting from nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the presence of short-wave radiation. Portugal has high solar radiation exposure and, consequently, near-surface ozone levels tend to reach, or even exceed, the threshold defined by the European Union air quality warning system during summer. Furthermore, episodes with high radiation, temperature, and ozone concentration values are expected to increase owing to more recurrent and persistent heatwaves and wildfires driven by climate change. Exposure to high ozone concentrations has negative effects on human health and vegetation. The present study aims to understand the atmospheric patterns associated with high ozone levels and identify the main ozone precursors on mainland Portugal. The analysis was carried out for daily ozone concentrations averaged between 0900 and 2100 UTC, from 2004 to 2022. A stepwise regression analysis was applied to the potential predictors: fire radiative power, thermal amplitude, maximum temperature, boundary layer height, NO2 concentration, radiation, and time of the year. The obtained model shows high accuracy and robustness, even when tested with the Monte Carlo method, and indicates that the predictors have a joint and different contribution to ozone formation across the Portuguese regions. The variables that have greater coefficients as a response from the stepwise regression model were temperature and fire radiative power, with fire radiative power being more significant for Norte and Centro regions, which are the most affected by wildfires. Radiation and temperature are more relevant in the Alentejo and Sul regions, where radiation and temperatures are climatologically higher."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107779,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文探讨了利用气溶胶干预热带气旋生成的可能性。其核心观点是，热带气旋的形成依赖于深对流的持续发展，而气溶胶可以通过影响云微物理过程来干扰对流的发生，从而减缓甚至阻止热带气旋的形成。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为理解气溶胶的类型、浓度及其时空分布对于评估这种干预策略的有效性至关重要。卫星观测可以提供大范围的气溶胶和云特性数据，而空气质量监测网络则可以提供地面气溶胶浓度信息，两者结合可以帮助我们更好地理解气溶胶对热带气旋形成的影响。此外，对大气成分的分析，特别是气溶胶的组成和大小分布，对于设计有效的干预策略也至关重要。因此，论文的研究内容与大气环境遥感技术，特别是气溶胶遥感和云遥感，有着紧密的联系。,"['Aerosols', 'Satellite observations', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Tropical cyclone formation', 'Convection', 'Cloud microphysics']",Thao Linh Tran;Roslyn Prinsley;Daniel Rosenfeld;Helen Cleugh;Jiwen Fan,Can we mitigate tropical cyclone formation using aerosols? A review of cyclogenesis and aerosol effects as a theoretical basis,"•All genesis theories agree deep convection outbreak causes intensifying circulation. •Interrupting convective development by aerosols is likely to affect cyclogenesis. •Coarse and fine aerosols affect cyclogenesis through unique microphysic effects. 
 Tropical cyclogenesis is a complex phenomenon, involving processes across multiple scales, with various theories proposed to explain its mechanisms. This paper provides an up-to-date summary of the established physical mechanisms and controlling factors of cyclogenesis. Understanding the nature of tropical cyclone formation is necessary to improve tropical cyclone forecasts and inform tropical cyclone mitigation strategies targeting early-stage intervention. Despite the disparities among theories, the critical role of persistent, intensified convection in tropical cyclone initiation is universally acknowledged. Therefore, our hypothesis is that interrupting convective development using aerosol injection is a potential strategy for mitigating tropical cyclone formation. Targetted injection of coarse and fine aerosols at the formation stage are two proposed potential approaches for mitigating tropical cyclones. These methods have completely different microphysical effects but each may ultimately interfere with the formation of the nascent cyclone. These potential interventions open new areas of further research, which are important and necessary to establish a solid scientific foundation for cyclogenesis mitigation."

The CH4 concentrations were mapped against the emissions in the agro-climatic zones, and a statistically high correlation was found in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region. 
 Atmospheric methane (CH4) is a potent climate change agent responsible for a fraction of global warming. The present study investigated the spatiotemporal variability of atmospheric-column-averaged CH4  (XCH4)  concentrations using data from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P/TROPOMI) from 2009 to 2022 over the south Asian region. During the study period, the long-term trends in XCH4 increased from 1700 to 1950 ppb, with an annual growth rate of 8.76 ppb yr−1. Among all natural and anthropogenic sources of CH4, the rate of increase in XCH4 was higher over the coal site at about 10.15 ± 0.55 ppb yr−1 (Paschim Bardhaman) followed by Mundra Ultra Mega Power Project at about 9.72 ± 0.41 ppb yr−1. Most of the wetlands exhibit an annual trend of XCH4 of more than 9.50 ppb yr−1, with a minimum rate of 8.72 ± 0.3 ppb yr−1 over Wular Lake. The WetCHARTs-based emissions of CH4 from the wetlands were minimal during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons. Maximum CH4 emissions were reported during the monsoon, with a maximum value of 23.62 ± 3.66 mg m−2 per month over the Sundarbans Wetland. For the 15 Indian agroclimatic zones, significant high emissions of CH4 were observed over the Middle Gangetic Plain, Trans-Gangetic Plain, Upper Gangetic Plain, Eastern Coastal Plains, Lower Gangetic Plain, and East Gangetic Plain. Further, the bottom-up anthropogenic CH4 emissions data are mapped against the XCH4 concentrations, and a high correlation was found in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region, indicating the hotspots of anthropogenic CH4."

Hopke,"Review of source analyses of ambient volatile organic compounds considering reactive losses: methods of reducing loss effects, impacts of losses, and sources","Reactive loss of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a long-term issue yet to be resolved in VOC source analyses. We assess common methods of, and existing issues in, reducing losses, impacts of losses, and sources in current source analyses. We offer a potential supporting role for solving issues of VOC conversion. Source analyses of consumed VOCs that reacted to produce ozone and secondary organic aerosols can play an important role in the effective control of secondary pollution in air. 
 Chemical losses of ambient reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a long-term issue yet to be resolved in VOC source apportionments. These losses substantially reduce the concentrations of highly reactive species in the apportioned factor profiles and result in the underestimation of source contributions. This review assesses the common methods and existing issues in ways to reduce losses and loss impacts in source analyses and suggests research directions for improved VOC source apportionments. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) is now the main VOC source analysis method compared to other mathematical models. The issue in using any apportionment tool is the processing of the data to be analyzed to reduce the impacts of reactive losses. Estimating the initial concentrations of ambient VOCs based on photochemical age has become the primary approach to reduce reactive loss effects in PMF, except for selecting low-reactivity species or nighttime data into the analysis. Currently, the initial concentration method only considers daytime reactions with hydroxyl (•OH) radicals. However, the •OH rate constants vary with temperature, and that has not been considered. Losses from reactions with O3 and NO3 radicals, especially for alkene species, remain to be included. Thus, the accuracy of the photochemical age estimation is uncertain. Beyond developing accurate quantitative approaches for reactive losses, source analyses methods for the consumed VOCs and the accurate quantification of different source contributions to O3 and secondary organic aerosols are important additional directions for future research."

The results underscore the good agreement with isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements and the ability of the instrument to monitor biological processes. 
 Atmospheric dioxygen (O2) concentration and isotopic composition are closely linked to the carbon cycle through anthropic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. The measurement of the isotopic ratio of O2, trapped in ice core bubbles, brings information about past variation in the hydrological cycle at low latitudes, as well as past productivity. Currently, the interpretation of those variations could be drastically improved with a better (i.e., quantitative) knowledge of the oxygen isotopic fractionation that occurs during photosynthesis and respiration processes. This could be achieved, for example, during experiments using closed biological chambers. In order to estimate the isotopic fractionation coefficient with good precision, one of the principal limitations is the need for high-frequency online measurements of isotopic composition of O2, expressed as δ18O of O2 (δ18O(O2)) and O2 concentration. To address this issue, we developed a new instrument, based on the optical-feedback cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (OF-CEAS) technique, enabling high-temporal-resolution and continuous measurements of O2 concentration as well as δ18O(O2), both simultaneously. The minimum Allan deviation occurred between 10 and 20 min,  while precision reached 0.002 % for the O2 concentration and 0.06 ‰ for δ18O(O2), which correspond to the optimal integration time and analytical precision before instrumental drift started degrading the measurements. Instrument accuracy was in good agreement with dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Measured values were slightly affected by humidity, and we decided to measure δ18O(O2) and O2 concentration after drying the gas. On the other hand, a 1 % increase in O2 concentration increased the δ18O(O2) by 0.53 ‰. To ensure the good quality of O2 concentration and δ18O(O2) measurements we eventually proposed to measure the calibration standard every 20 min."

 Thermodynamic profiles in the atmospheric boundary layer can be retrieved from ground-based passive remote sensing instruments like infrared spectrometers and microwave radiometers with optimal-estimation physical retrievals. With a high temporal resolution on the order of minutes, these thermodynamic profiles are a powerful tool to study the evolution of the boundary layer and to evaluate numerical models. In this study, we describe three recent modifications to the Tropospheric Remotely Observed Profiling via Optimal Estimation (TROPoe) retrieval framework, which improve the availability of valid solutions for different atmospheric conditions and increase the temporal consistency of the retrieved profiles. We present methods to enhance the availability of valid solutions retrieved from infrared spectrometers by preventing overfitting and by adding information from an additional spectral band in high-moisture environments. We show that the characterization of the uncertainty of the input and the choice of spectral infrared bands are crucial for retrieval performance. Since each profile is retrieved independently from the previous one, the time series of the thermodynamic variables contain random uncorrelated noise, which may hinder the study of diurnal cycles and temporal tendencies. By including a previous retrieved profile as input to the retrieval, we increase the temporal consistency between subsequent profiles without suppressing real mesoscale atmospheric variability. We demonstrate that these modifications work well at midlatitudes, polar and tropical sites, and for retrievals based on infrared spectrometer and microwave radiometer measurements."

Adams,Tomographic reconstruction algorithms for retrieving two-dimensional ice cloud microphysical parameters using along-track (sub)millimeter-wave radiometer observations,"This paper presents our latest development in tomographic cloud reconstruction algorithms that use multi-angle TB observations to reconstruct the spatial distribution of ice clouds. Compared to nadir-only retrievals, the tomographic technique provides a detailed reconstruction of ice clouds’ inner structure with high spatial resolution and significantly improves retrieval accuracy. Also, the tomography technique effectively increases detection sensitivity for small ice cloud particles. 
 The submillimeter-wave radiometer operating in the along-track scanning mode continuously collects brightness temperature (TB) data over a two-dimensional (2D) cloud cross-section as the platform moves forward. TB observations from multiple positions and viewing angles show great promise in better constraining the 2D cloud microphysical properties compared to single-angle observations. In this study, we develop two types of tomographic reconstruction algorithms to retrieve 2D ice water content (IWC) profiles using multi-angle TB observations. The one-dimensional (1D) tomographic algorithm performs 1D retrievals beam by beam using each TB observation at a specific position and angle to derive cloud properties along the propagation path. It then integrates the 1D retrieval results to construct 2D cloud distributions. The 2D tomographic algorithm directly constrains the 2D cloud microphysical properties using multi-angle scanning TB observations. Starting with an initial assumption, the algorithm iteratively refines the 2D cloud microphysical quantities by minimizing discrepancies between TB simulations and observations under prior constraints. Both tomographic algorithms are developed based on a hybrid of Bayesian Monte Carlo Integration (MCI) and Optimal Estimation Method (OEM). A simulation experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of two tomographic reconstruction algorithms. The experiment demonstrates stable convergence of both tomographic methods, with the 2D tomographic algorithm exhibiting superior performance. The experiment results highlight the significant advantage of using multi-angle observations to constrain 2D cloud structure. Compared to nadir-only retrievals, the tomographic technique provides a detailed reconstruction of ice clouds’ inner structure with high spatial resolution. Also, the technique significantly improves retrieval accuracy by correcting systematic biases and reducing the derivation of retrieval errors. Furthermore, the tomography technique effectively increases detection sensitivity for small ice cloud particles."

This methodology considers the interference of atmospheric temperature, humidity, and surface temperature on SO2 detection and retrieval, laying the groundwork for developing a more accurate and flexible volcanic SO2 retrieval algorithm under different atmospheric conditions. 
 The Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Type II (HIRAS-II) aboard the Fengyun 3E (FY-3E) satellite provides valuable data on the vertical distribution of atmospheric states. However, effectively extracting quantitative atmospheric information from the observations is challenging due to the large number of hyperspectral sensor channels, inter-channel correlations, associated observational errors, and susceptibility of the results to influence by trace gases. This study explores the potential of FY-3E/HIRAS-II to atmospheric loadings of SO2 from volcanic eruption. A methodology for selecting SO2 sensitive channels from the large number of hyperspectral channels recorded by FY-3E/HIRAS-II is presented. The methodology allows for the selection of SO2-sensitive channels that contain similar information on variations in atmospheric temperature and water vapor for minimizing the influence of atmospheric water vapor and temperature to SO2. A sensitivity study shows that the difference in brightness temperature between the experimentally selected SO2 sensitive channels and the background channels effectively removes interference signals from surface temperature, atmospheric temperature, and water vapor during SO2 detection and inversion. A positive difference between near-surface atmospheric temperature and surface temperature enables the infrared band to capture more SO2 information in the lower and middle layers. The efficacy of FY-3E/HIRAS-II SO2 sensitive channels in quantitively monitor volcanic SO2 is demonstrated using data from the 29 April 2024 eruption of Mount Ruang in Indonesia. Using FY-3E/HIRAS-II measurements, the spatial distribution and quantitatively information of volcanic SO2 are easily observed. The channel selection can significantly enhance the computation efficiency while maintain the accuracy of SO2 detection and retrieval, despite the large volume of data."

 The surface elevation of the Greenland Ice Sheet is constantly changing due to the interplay between surface mass balance processes and ice dynamics, each exhibiting distinct spatiotemporal patterns.

We produce continuous monthly ice surface elevation changes from January 2003 to August 2023 on a 1 km grid covering the entire GIS. We estimate cumulative ice loss of 4,352 Gt ± 315 Gt (12.1 ± 0.9 mm sea level equivalent) during this period, excluding peripheral glaciers.

The valid time shifting EnKF (VTS-EnKF) addresses this by adjusting for position errors, enhancing accuracy in forecasting dust storms, as proven in tests on 2021 events, even with smaller ensembles and time intervals. 
 Dust storms pose significant risks to health and property, necessitating accurate forecasting for preventive measures. Despite advancements, dust models grapple with uncertainties arising from emission and transport processes. Data assimilation addresses these by integrating observations to rectify model error, enhancing forecast precision. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a widely used assimilation algorithm that effectively optimize model states, particularly in terms of intensity adjustment. However, the EnKF's efficacy is challenged by position errors between modeled and observed dust features, especially under substantial position errors. This study introduces the valid time shifting ensemble Kalman filter (VTS-EnKF), which combines stochastic EnKF with a valid time shifting mechanism. By recruiting additional ensemble members from neighboring valid times, this method not only accommodates variations in dust load but also explicitly accounts for positional uncertainties. Consequently, the enlarged ensemble better represents both the intensity and positional errors, thereby optimizing the utilization of observational data. The proposed VTS-EnKF was evaluated against two severe dust storm cases from spring 2021, demonstrating that position errors notably deteriorated forecast performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized mean bias (NMB), impeding the EnKF's effective assimilation. Conversely, the VTS-EnKF improved both the analysis and forecast accuracy compared to the conventional EnKF. Additionally, to provide a more rigorous assessment of its performance, experiments were conducted using fewer ensemble members and different time intervals."

Its structure is informed by the physical and chemical principles of the atmosphere, allowing it to learn and replicate complex atmospheric processes. FastCTM demonstrated matching accuracy to traditional models with less computational demand. It also provides analysis of how different atmospheric processes contribute to air quality changes. 
 Chemical transport models (CTM) have wide and profound applications in air quality simulations and managements. However, its applications are often constrained by high computational burdens. In this study, we developed a neural network based CTM model (FastCTM) to efficiently simulate ten air pollutant composition variables, including major PM2.5 species of SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, organic matters and other inorganic components, coarse part of PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3. The FastCTM has a principle-informed structure by explicitly encoding atmospheric physical and chemical processes in a basic simulator. Specifically, in the simulator, five neural network modules are proposed to respectively represent five major atmospheric processes of primary emissions, transport, diffusion, chemical reactions and depositions. Given 1-hour initial condition data, the FastCTM is able to simulate future 24-hour concentrations of the ten air pollutants with corresponding meteorology fields and emissions as input. The FastCTM is trained with operational forecast data from a numerical CTM model named Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) in 2018–2022. The well-trained FastCTM is evaluated comparing to the long-term CMAQ forecast in an independent year 2023, and achieves high agreements with mean RMSE values of 9.1, 11.9, 4.4, 4.0, 48.9 and 10.9 μg/m3 and R2 values of 0.8, 0.81, 0.8, 0.83, 0.9 and 0.7 for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. Besides, assessed against hourly site observations of six criteria pollutants, the RMSE values of FastCTM have small relative differences of 4.3 %, 4.2 %, -2.8 %, -1.7 %, -0.3 % and -3.2 % compared to that of CMAQ. The FastCTM model also exhibited reasonable responses of air quality to meteorological variables of air temperature, wind speed and planetary boundary layer height, as well as to input pollutant emissions. Furthermore, due to the principles-oriented structure, internal process analysis could be performed by FastCTM to quantify the specific contribution from each of the five processes for hourly air pollutant concentration changes. In a nutshell, FastCTM has multi-functional advantages in air pollutant concentration simulations, sensitivity analysis and internal process analysis with high computation efficiencies on GPU and accuracy.

Silva,A Nudge to the Truth: Atom Conservation as a Hard Constraint in Models of Atmospheric Composition Using a Species-Weighted Correction,"Computational models of atmospheric composition are not always physically consistent. For example, not all models respect fundamental conservation laws such as conservation of atoms in an interconnected chemical system. In well performing models, these unphysical deviations are often ignored because they are frequently minor, and thus only need a small nudge to perfectly conserve mass. Here we introduce a method that anchors a prediction from any numerical model to physically consistent hard constraints, nudging concentrations to the nearest solution that respects the conservation laws. This closed-form model-agnostic correction uses a single matrix operation to minimally perturb the predicted concentrations to ensure that atoms are conserved to machine precision. To demonstrate this approach, we train a gradient boosting decision tree ensemble to emulate a small reference model of ozone photochemistry and test the effect of the correction on accurate but nonconservative predictions. The nudging approach minimally perturbs the already well-predicted results for most species, but decreases the accuracy of important oxidants, including radicals. We develop a weighted extension of this nudging approach that considers the uncertainty and magnitude of each species in the correction. This species-level weighting approach is essential to accurately predict important low concentration species such as radicals. We find that applying the species-weighted correction slightly improves overall accuracy by nudging unphysical predictions to a more likely mass-conserving solution."

McColl,Unexpected Warming From Land Radiative Management,"“Land radiative management” (LRM)—deliberately increasing surface albedo to decrease temperatures—has been proposed as a form of geoengineering to mitigate the effects of regional warming. Here, we show that, contrary to expectations, LRM causes temperatures to increase in surrounding regions. The basic reason for the increase is unintended impacts on precipitation. Precipitation is suppressed over the LRM region, but this effect also extends to nearby areas unprotected by LRM. The reduction in precipitation and soil moisture in these regions leads to higher temperatures than would be expected in the absence of LRM. The resulting warming outside the LRM region is comparable to the cooling achieved inside it. This implies that, if wealthy regions unilaterally adopt LRM to cool, their neighbors may experience warming, worsening heat inequality."

However, the quantitative estimation and numerical description in current models are still limited. Here, a comprehensive study utilizing multiple observations and modeling methods to assess the influence of vegetation and snow on dust was conducted. We found that Gobi deserts exhibit substantial monthly and interannual variability in dust storms, which shows a close connection with vegetation and snow. To quantitatively understand the impact of vegetation and snow cover on dust emissions and also to better characterize such effects in numerical models, we introduced a high‐resolution dynamic dust source function that incorporates the effects of vegetation and snow on erodibility. The new parameterization noticeably improved dust‐related simulations, including aerosol optical thickness and PM10 concentrations, and provided insights into the distinct effects of vegetation and snow on dust emissions. This study sheds light on the effects of vegetation and snow on dust storms over the Gobi Desert, highlighting the importance of dynamic representation of time‐varying surface properties in dust simulation."

 The change of groundwater storage (GWS) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is vital for water resources management and regional sustainability, but its estimation has large uncertainty due to insufficient hydrological measurements and diverse future climate scenarios. Here, we employ high-resolution land surface modeling, advanced satellite observations, global climate model data, and deep learning to estimate GWS changes in the past and future. We find a 3.51 ± 2.40 Gt yr−1 increase in GWS from 2002–2018, especially in exorheic basins, attributed to glacier melting. The GWS will persistently increase in the future, but the growth rate is slowing down (0.14 Gt yr−1 for 2079–2100 under a high emission scenario). Increasing GWS is projected over most endorheic basins, which is associated with increasing precipitation and decreasing shortwave radiation. In contrast, decreasing GWS is projected over the headwaters of Amu Darya, Yangtze, and Yellow river basins.

 The formation of water ice clouds or hazes on Mars imposes substantial limitations on the vertical transport of water into the middle-upper atmosphere, impacting the planet’s hydrogen loss. Recent observations made by the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer instrument onboard Mars 2020 Perseverance rover have shown a marked decline in water ice abundance within the mesosphere (above 35-40 km) when Mars is near its aphelion (near the northern summer solstice), notably occurring during solar longitudes (Ls) between Ls 70∘ and 80∘. Orbital observations around the same latitudes indicate that temperatures between  ~ 30-40 km reach a minimum during the same period. Using cloud microphysics simulations, we demonstrate that this decrease in temperature effectively increases the amount of water cold-trapped at those altitudes, confining water ice condensation to lower altitudes. Similarly, the reinforcement of the cold trap induced by the lower temperatures results in significant reductions in the water vapor mixing ratio above 35–40 km, explaining the confinement of water vapor observed around aphelion from orbiters.

 The 2015–2016 El Niño-induced drought caused biomass loss in global tropical forests, yet the recovery duration of different vegetation components (woody components, upper canopies, and leaves) remains unknown. Here, we use satellite remote sensing data of vegetation optical depth and leaf area index, with varying sensitivity to different vegetation components, to examine vegetation recovery during the drought event. We find that the woody component had the slowest recovery compared to the upper canopy and leaves, and displayed greater spatial variability between continents. Key factors influencing woody recovery include drought severity, moisture-related climatic conditions (i.e., vapor pressure deficit, precipitation, and soil moisture), and seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation. Our study highlights the importance of different vegetation components for maintaining ecosystem balance under drought disturbances and indicates the need for further research to explore recovery mechanisms and the long-term impacts of drought on forest dynamics.

 The reduced economic and social activities during the Chinese New Year offer a unique opportunity to assess declines in anthropogenic emissions. However, limited research quantifies changes in PM2.5, NO2, and O3 concentrations during this period while accounting for meteorological conditions. This study utilized machine learning and the Time Warping-based K-Means method to evaluate the effectiveness of firework bans, the impact of emission reductions on pollutants during the Chinese New Year holiday, and the influence of meteorological conditions on pollutant concentrations during this period. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in emissions, with PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations decreasing by up to 24.76% and 33.39%, respectively, while O3 concentrations increased by up to 45%. Regions without firework bans saw peak PM2.5 levels on New Year's Eve. The ban has been effective, though signs of relaxation appeared in 2023. It is worth noting that pollution during the 2018 Chinese New Year holiday was more severe than before the holiday because the meteorological conditions before the holiday were favorable for pollutant dispersion, while unfavorable meteorological conditions during the holiday masked the emission reductions that occurred due to the holiday period. These results emphasize the significant role of meteorological conditions and the need for stricter emission controls beyond traffic restrictions or factory shutdowns to mitigate haze pollution during adverse weather."

Murphy,Understanding the mechanism and importance of brown carbon bleaching across the visible spectrum in biomass burning plumes from the WE-CAN campaign,"The magnitude and evolution of brown carbon (BrC) absorption remain unclear, with uncertainty in climate models. Data from the WE-CAN airborne experiment show that model parameterizations overestimate the mass absorption cross section (MAC) of BrC. Observed decreases in BrC absorption with chemical markers are due to decreasing organic aerosol (OA) mass rather than a decreasing BrC MAC, which is currently implemented in models. Water-soluble BrC contributes 23 % of total absorption at 660 nm. 
 Aerosol absorption of visible light has an important impact on global radiative forcing. Wildfires are one of the major sources of light-absorbing aerosol, but there remains significant uncertainty about the magnitude, wavelength dependence, and bleaching of absorption from biomass burning aerosol. We collected and analyzed data from 21 western US wildfire smoke plumes during the 2018 Western Wildfire Experiment for Cloud Chemistry, Aerosol Absorption and Nitrogen (WE-CAN) airborne measurement campaign to determine the contribution of black carbon (BC), brown carbon (BrC), and lensing to the aerosol mass absorption cross section (MAC). Comparison to commonly used parameterizations and modeling studies suggests that model overestimation of absorption is likely due to incorrect BrC refractive indices. Modelers (Wang et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2021) invoke a bleaching process that decreases the MAC of organic aerosol (OA) to offset the overestimation of absorption in models. However, no evidence of a decreasing MAC is observed in individual WE-CAN fire plumes or in aged plumes from multiple fires. A decrease in OA mass and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), both normalized by carbon monoxide (CO) to correct for dilution, is observed with an increasing oxygen-to-carbon (O : C) ratio and a decreasing gas-phase toluene : benzene ratio, when data from all fires are combined in half of the individual fire plumes. This results in a strong decrease in total absorption at 405 nm and a slight decrease at 660 nm with these chemical markers. These results demonstrate that changes in absorption with chemical markers of plume age are the result of decreasing OA rather than changes in the MAC of the organic material itself. While decreasing MAC or OA mass with aging could both be called bleaching and can both correct overestimation of absorption in models, it is important to distinguish between these two effects because decreasing OA mass will also decrease scattering, which will cause a significantly different net radiative effect. We also find that an average of 54 % of non-BC absorption (23 % total absorption) at 660 nm is from water-soluble BrC, confirming that BrC absorption is important across the visible spectrum. Quantification of significant BrC at red wavelengths and observation of bleaching being caused by changes in OA with O : C and toluene : benzene markers of plume age provide important improvements to our understanding of BrC and critical constraints on aerosol absorption in regional and global climate models."
10.5194/acp-24-12943-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文利用区域化学传输模型，定量分析了中国主要污染物减排对空气污染物和光化学参数的敏感性，重点关注冬季和夏季的典型条件。研究结果表明，氮氧化物（NOx）减排虽然降低了颗粒物硝酸盐的浓度，但同时也导致臭氧（O3）浓度增加，这与NOx滴定效应的降低和OH自由基水平的升高有关。此外，氧化有机挥发物（OVOCs）的光解和OH相关的反应增强了大气氧化能力，也促进了臭氧的形成。论文认为，要有效缓解臭氧污染，需要同时减少NOx和特定VOCs（特别是烯烃、芳烃和不饱和OVOCs，包括甲醇和乙醇）的排放。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它关注的是大气成分（臭氧、氮氧化物、挥发性有机物）的分析以及通过模型模拟来研究减排措施对空气质量的影响，这与利用卫星观测和地面监测数据进行空气质量监测和大气成分分析的研究方向一致。,"['tropospheric ozone', 'nitrogen oxides', 'volatile organic compounds', 'air quality monitoring', 'chemical transport model', 'emission reduction']",Jianing Dai;Guy P.

The study provides insights into further air quality control in China with reduced primary emissions. 
 Despite substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions, ozone (O3) pollution remains a severe environmental problem in urban China. These reductions affect ozone formation by altering levels of O3 precursors, intermediates, and the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. However, the underlying mechanisms driving O3 changes are still not fully understood. Here, we employ a regional chemical transport model to quantify ozone changes due to a specified emission reduction (50 %) for winter and summer conditions in 2018. Our results indicate that reductions in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions increase surface O3 concentrations by 15 %–33 % on average across China in winter and by up to 17 % in volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited areas during summer. These ozone increases are associated with a reduced NOx titration effect and higher levels of OH radicals. Reducing NOx emissions significantly decreases the concentration of particulate nitrate, which enhances ozone formation through increased HO2 radical levels due to reduced aerosol uptake and diminished aerosol extinction. Additionally, an enhanced atmospheric oxidative capacity, driven by larger contributions from the photolysis of oxidized VOCs (OVOCs) and OH-related reactions, also favors urban ozone formation. With additional reductions in anthropogenic VOC emissions, increases in summertime ozone (VOC-limited areas) can be offset by reduced production of radicals from VOC oxidations. To effectively mitigate ozone pollution, a simultaneous reduction in the emission of NOx and specific VOC species should be applied, especially regarding alkenes, aromatics, and unsaturated OVOCs, including methanol and ethanol."

The cooling rate is difficult to quantify above 35 km due to a deficit of long-term observational data with high vertical resolution in this region. We use satellite observations from several instruments, including a new temperature product from OSIRIS, to show that the upper stratosphere, from 35–60 km, cooled by 0.5 to 1 K per decade over 2005–2021 and by 0.6 K per decade over 1979–2021. 
 Temperature trends in the upper stratosphere, particularly above ∼ 45 km,  are difficult to quantify due to a lack of observational data with high vertical resolution in this region that span multiple decades. The recent v7.3 upper-stratospheric (35–60 km) temperature data product from the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) includes over 22 years of observations that can be used to estimate temperature trends. The trends in OSIRIS temperatures over 2005–2021 are compared to those from two other satellite limb instruments: Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). We find that the upper stratosphere cooled by ∼ 0.5 to 1 K per decade  during this period. Results from the three instruments are generally in agreement. By merging the OSIRIS observations with those from channel 3 of the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU), we find that the stratosphere cooled at a rate of approximately −0.6 K per decade between 1979 and 2021 near 45 km, in agreement with earlier results based on SSU and MLS. The similarity between OSIRIS temperature trends and those from other records improves confidence in observed upper-stratospheric temperature changes over the last several decades."

Pye,Role of chemical production and depositional losses on formaldehyde in the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM),"We develop the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM) version 2 to improve predictions of formaldehyde in ambient air compared to satellite-, aircraft-, and ground-based observations. With the updated chemistry, we estimate the cancer risk from inhalation exposure to ambient formaldehyde across the contiguous USA and predict that 40 % of this risk is controllable through reductions in anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides and reactive organic carbon. 
 Formaldehyde (HCHO) is an important air pollutant with direct cancer risk and ozone-forming potential. HCHO sources are complex because HCHO is both directly emitted and produced from oxidation of most gas-phase reactive organic carbon. We update the secondary production of HCHO in the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM) in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Production of HCHO from isoprene and monoterpenes is increased, correcting an underestimate in the current version. Simulated June–August surface HCHO during peak photochemical production (11:00–15:00 LT, local time) increased by 0.6 ppb (32 %) over the southeastern USA and by 0.2 ppb (13 %) over the contiguous USA. The increased HCHO compares more favorably with satellite-based observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and from aircraft-based observations. Evaluation against hourly surface observations indicates a missing nighttime sink that can be improved by increased nighttime deposition, which reduces June–August nocturnal (20:00–04:00 LT) surface HCHO by 1.1 ppb (36 %) over the southeastern USA and 0.5 ppb (29 %) over the contiguous USA. The ability of CRACMM to capture peak levels of HCHO at midday is improved, particularly at sites in the northeastern USA, while peak levels at sites in the southeastern USA are improved, although still lower than observed. Using established risk assessment methods, lifetime exposure of the population in the contiguous USA (∼ 320 million) to ambient HCHO levels predicted here may result in 6200 lifetime cancer cases, with 40 % from controllable anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides and reactive organic compounds.

 Forests in Europe are undergoing complex changes that require a comprehensive monitoring of disturbance occurrence. Here we present the European Forest Disturbance Atlas (EFDA), a Landsat-based approach for mapping annual forest disturbances across continental Europe since 1985. We built a consistent Landsat data cube of summer composites and compiled reference data on forest land use and forest disturbances. A classification-based approach was developed to detect forest disturbances annually, therefore accounting for multiple disturbance events per time-series. The EFDA contains annual layers on disturbance occurrence, severity and agent, as well as aggregated layers on the number of disturbances and the latest and greatest disturbance year. Based on the annual disturbance estimates (1985–2023), we quantified a total forest disturbed area of 439,000 km2, increasing to 610,000 km2 when accounting for multiple disturbance events. Map accuracies of the disturbance classification showed an overall F1-score of 0.89, with very low errors (<1 %) for the undisturbed class and with commission and omission errors for the disturbed class of 17.3 % and 22.5 %, respectively. Further, temporal validation revealed errors decreased over time, with commission substantially decreases to 10.6 % after the year 2000. The workflow implemented to create annual forest disturbance maps was designed for easy updating when new data arrives and in an open access framework to facilitate reproducibility, thus paving the road for an operational forest disturbance system in Europe.

Here, we report that redox oscillations can effectively drive ROS production from BC. Following sequential microbial reduction and air exposure, 6.5 ± 0.2 μM/gC hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and 285.3 ± 9.5 nM/gC hydroxyl radical (•OH) were produced from BC. Moreover, BC derived from various biomass sources, temperatures, and particle sizes exhibits 111.5-fold variations in ROS production. Electrochemical analyses revealed that both the electron transfer capacity and the ROS production selectivity are critical determinants of ROS generation under redox oscillations. The variation in electron transfer capacity (0.3–5.7 mmol e–/gC) is primarily governed by the abundance of electron-storing moieties such as quinones, while the ROS generation selectivity (26.2–72.0%) is influenced by the presence of competitive sites for oxygen reduction reactions, such as carbon defects. These findings provide insights into ROS production from BC under fluctuating redox conditions, with potential implications for elemental cycles and pollutant dynamics in regions prone to wildfire and stubble burning events and substantial BC deposition (e.g., wetlands and rice paddies)."

However, existing methods are limited by imbalanced samples from observations. Here, we introduce a novel deep-learning model-measurement fusion method (DeepMMF) constrained by physical laws inferred from a chemical transport model (CTM) to estimate NO2 concentrations over the Continental United States (CONUS). By pretraining with spatiotemporally complete CTM simulations, fine-tuning with satellite and ground measurements, and employing a novel optimization strategy for selecting proper prior emission, DeepMMF delivers improved NO2 estimates, showing greater consistency and daily variation alignment with observations (with NMB reduced from −0.3 to −0.1 compared to original CTM simulations). More importantly, DeepMMF effectively addressed the sample imbalance issue that causes overestimation (by over 100%) of downwind or rural concentrations in other methods. It achieves a higher R2 of 0.98 and a lower RMSE of 1.45 ppb compared to surface NO2 observations, overperforming other approaches, which show R2 values of 0.4–0.7 and RMSEs of 3–6 ppb. The method also offers a synergistic advantage by adjusting corresponding emissions, in agreement with changes (−10% to −20%) reported in the NEI between 2019 and 2020. Our results demonstrate the great potential of DeepMMF in data fusion to better support air pollution exposure estimation and forecasting."

Five convectively active regions in the Tropics, two over land (Africa and Amazon) and three over ocean (eastern and western Pacific and Atlantic), are selected to understand the influence of immediate environment of clouds on CREs. Fluxes derived from 19 years of high‐resolution CERES satellite data, categorized by cloud type, are utilized. The cloud types are classified based on the joint cloud top pressure and cloud optical depth distribution. For the entire tropical region, differences in cloud‐type mean CRE with regional mean and immediate environment clear skies range from −7.8 to 10.7 Wm−2 for shortwave (SW), 2.9 to 15.8 Wm−2 for longwave (LW), and 6.1 to 17.9 Wm−2 for net, respectively. The oceanic and Amazonia regions have negative (positive) SW (LW) CRE differences, typically 2–6 Wm−2 in SW but 7–10 Wm−2 in LW, whereas Africa has positive SW and LW CRE differences (typically 20–30 Wm−2, up to 40–50 Wm−2). The influence of immediate environment reduces the regionally averaged, that is, cloud‐type mean CREs weighted by cloud fractions, SW cloud cooling, and LW cloud warming in four of the five regions except for Africa. For Africa, it increases the SW cloud cooling and greatly reduces the LW cloud warming, resulting in net cloud cooling as in other regions instead of warming.

These vertical water fluxes through the marine boundary layer affect low cloud climate feedback and, combined with isotope fractionation, are hypothesized to explain the depletion of tropical precipitation at higher precipitation rates known as the “amount effect.” Here, an efficient and numerically stable quasi‐analytical model simulates the evaporation of raindrops and enrichment of their isotope composition. It is applied to a drop size distribution and subcloud environment representative of Atlantic trade cumulus clouds. Idealized physics experiments artificially zero out selected processes to discern the separate effects on the isotope ratio of raindrops, of exchange with the environment, evaporation, and kinetic molecular diffusion. A parameterization of size‐dependent molecular and eddy diffusion is formulated that enriches raindrops much more strongly (+5‰ for deuterated water [HDO] and +3.5‰ for H218 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}^{18}$O) than equilibrium evaporation as they become smaller than 1 mm. The effect on evaporated vapor is also assessed. Rain evaporation enriches subcloud vapor by +12‰ per mm rain (for HDO), explaining observations of enriched vapor in cold pools sourced by evaporatively cooled downdrafts. Drops smaller than 0.5 mm evaporate completely before falling 700 m in typical subtropical marine boundary layer conditions. The early and complete evaporation of these smaller drops in the rain size distribution enriches the vapor produced by rain evaporation."

 Accurate estimation of carbon removal by terrestrial ecosystems and oceans is crucial to the success of global carbon mitigation initiatives. The emergence of multi-source CO2 observations offers prospects for an improved assessment of carbon fluxes. However, the utility of these diverse observations has been limited by their heterogeneity, leading to much variation in estimated carbon fluxes. To harvest the diverse data types, this paper develops a multi-observation carbon assimilation system (MCAS), which simultaneously integrates both satellite and ground-based observations. MCAS modifies the ensemble Kalman filter to apply different inflation factors to different types of observation errors, addressing the heterogeneity between satellite and in situ data. In commonly used independent validation datasets, the carbon flux derived from MCAS outperformed those obtained from a single source, demonstrating a 20% reduction in error compared to existing carbon flux products. We use MCAS to conduct ecosystem and ocean carbon flux inversion for the period of 2016–2020, which reveals that the 5-year average global net terrestrial and ocean sink was 1.84 ± 0.60 and 2.74 ± 0.49 petagrams, absorbing approximately 47% of human-caused CO2 emissions together, which were consistent with the global carbon project estimates of 1.82 and 2.66 petagrams. All these facts suggest MCAS is a better methodology than those for assimilating single-source observation only."

 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detection and analysis techniques are critical for understanding their emissions, transport, and impacts. Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) is one of the most widely used methods for real-time monitoring VOCs emissions due to its high time resolution and low detection limits. Quantification of VOCs measurement data must be reliable to ensure data comparability, which heavily depends on measurement uncertainty. In this review, the definition of measurement uncertainty and its importance in VOCs measurements are present. Then, the sources of VOCs measurement uncertainty are discussed, and corresponding methods to reduce it are analyzed. Furthermore, several important innovations in PTR-MS calibration are detailed. These calibration innovations have enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of PTR-MS measurements. This review presents a recent calibration approach developed by the National Physics Laboratory (NPL) and the University of Utrecht, considered the most pragmatic for addressing PTR-MS measurement accuracy and comparability. Finally, perspectives for the PTR-MS are suggested: Technologies, such as electronics, optics, chemistry, mechanics, and so on, are anticipated to enhance PTR-MS systems, reduce costs, and increase their popularity."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107805,True,Atmospheric Research,"这篇论文研究了2008年前后北大西洋东部和乌拉尔地区12月至次年1月阻塞高压日数的年代际相反变化。研究发现，乌拉尔地区的阻塞高压日数在2008年后增加，而北大西洋东部和西欧地区则减少，呈现出偶极子型变化模式。这种变化与大气环流的改变密切相关，包括西风、纬向风垂直切变和经向位涡梯度等。此外，2008年后，北大西洋涛动正位相增强，北大西洋地区激发出准定常东传罗斯贝波，在大西洋东部至西伯利亚中部地区形成准正压“−, +, −”三极子环流异常。巴伦支海-喀拉海海冰浓度与阻塞高压日数偶极子型变化模式呈显著负相关，海冰减少导致局地向上地表湍流热通量增加，进一步激发罗斯贝波并有利于三极子环流异常的形成。大气内部动力过程对三极子环流异常具有正反馈作用，从而导致北大西洋东部和西欧地区（乌拉尔地区）的背景环流增强（减弱），阻塞高压日数减少（增加）。PAMIP模式模拟结果与观测结果大致一致。该研究使用了1980-2021年的观测数据集和PAMIP模式模拟数据，利用卫星观测数据分析海冰浓度变化，并结合大气环流模式研究其对阻塞高压的影响。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析（例如海冰浓度）。","['Sea ice concentration', 'Atmospheric circulation', 'Blocking days', 'Rossby waves', 'Satellite observations', 'North Atlantic Oscillation', 'Atmospheric pressure', 'Temperature', 'Wind', 'Humidity']",Yifan Xu;Ke Fan;Shengping He,Interdecadal opposite variation of December–January blocking days between the eastern North Atlantic and Ural region around 2008,"•A pronounced interdecadal opposite variation of December–January blocking days occurs in 2008. •The changes in the simultaneous atmospheric circulation contribute to the interdecadal variation of dipole pattern. •The rapid decrease in Barents–Kara sea ice, dominated by newly formed sea ice, significantlyinfluences the dipole pattern. 
 Based on observational datasets during 1980–2021 and the simulations from the PAMIP (Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project), this paper indicates that the eastern North Atlantic–Ural blocking days in December–January is characterized by a zonal dipole pattern which undergoes an interdecadal variation around 2008. Specifically, the blocking days in Ural (eastern North Atlantic–western Europe) regions increases (decreases) after 2008. Further research shows that the variation in the blocking days dipole (BDD) pattern is closely associated with the changes in the simultaneous background atmospheric circulation field including westerly winds, vertical shear of zonal winds, and meridional potential vorticity gradient over the eastern North Atlantic–Urals region. Moreover, after 2008, the positive North Atlantic Oscillation–like phase intensifies, a quasi-stationary eastward-propagating Rossby wave from the North Atlantic is excited, and a quasi-barotropic “−, +, −” tripole circulation anomaly in the eastern North Atlantic–Central Siberia is formed in the mid–upper troposphere. It is also found that, since 2008, there is a remarkable negative correlation between the Barents–Kara sea-ice concentration (SIC) and the BDD. After 2008, the rapid decrease in Barents–Kara SIC, dominated by newly formed SIC, is conducive to an increased local upward surface turbulent heat flux, further exciting Rossby waves and favoring the tripole circulation anomaly. Additionally, the atmospheric internal dynamical processes excited by the tripole circulation anomaly have positive feedback effects on it, contributing to strengthening (weakening) of the local background circulation field in the eastern North Atlantic–western Europe (Urals) region, thereby causing the blocking days to decrease (increase). The responses of the main physical processes to the Arctic sea ice reduction in the PAMIP models are roughly in agreement with the observations."

 To comprehend how continental aerosols influence the cloud-to-rain transition process, we deployed a series of airborne observation devices combined with a single-particle aerosol sampler to conduct aircraft-based cloud penetration observations. Our study yielded patterns of cloud droplet growth and the effective radius of cloud droplets. We conducted an in-depth analysis of the condensation and collision-coalescence of cloud droplets impacting aerosol particle size. Employing a fitting approach, we modeled the concentration of cloud droplets as a function of cloud droplet spectral dispersion under the influence of continental aerosols. Subsequently, we elucidated the physicochemical properties of continental aerosols at high altitudes and assessed the indirect radiative forcing of aerosols based on their dispersion degrees. These findings reveal that cloud droplets in the cloud underwent successive processes of condensation, collision-coalescence, and evaporation, resulting in a concomitant increase in the sizes of corresponding aerosols. The dispersion of cloud droplet spectra decreased with an increased concentration of cloud droplet numbers. This trend is associated with the impact of dispersion on the indirect radiative forcing of aerosols. We found that an 11 % increase in the indirect radiative forcing of aerosols was attributable to the dispersion effect. This underscores the complex interplay among aerosol characteristics, cloud microphysics, and radiative forcing, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of the cloud-to-rain transition process under the influence of continental aerosols."

Moreover, in some cities where there is a lack of observational data on urban air temperature (Ta), there has been a reliance on satellite-based land surface temperature (LST) to explore and predict the changes in near-surface thermal environments. However, it is still unclear how applicable LST is for exploring the temporal and spatial variation of air temperature across different seasons and background climates. To address these shortcomings, we used high-density crowdsourced Ta observations and satellite imagery to characterise the temporal variability of city-wide Ta and compare it with LST across 55 populated cities. Cities were selected according to the number of crowdsourced Ta measurements, percentage of clear sky pixels and global coverage. Results show that the temporal trends of city-wide LST and Ta agree more closely at night compared to daytime. During the day, the agreement is greater in winter, especially in colder climates. While the intra-urban spatial distribution of LST does not align with Ta, the city-average values are highly correlated. However, the strength of this correlation differs by season and time of day and is further influenced by background climate. If city-average trends are of focus, LST can be used as an indicator for exploring air temperature variations over time, particularly at night. LST can also be used for winter days in cities with temperate and cold climates. However, its application for summer daytime requires more caution, especially in arid cities. These findings provide new insights into the application of satellite-derived LST for exploring city-average temperature trends and variability."

An analysis of the figures provided by the IPCC reveals they assume that in average 75% of methane is ultimately oxidized to CO2, while the remaining 25% is converted to intermediate degradation products, most notably formaldehyde, which are removed from the atmosphere via wet and dry deposition and treated by the IPCC as a potential carbon sink in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In this short article, we present a critique of this assumption, based on existing knowledge about the environmental fate of methane’s degradation products. We conclude that any assumption other than full degradation of methane to CO2 in a rather short time frame is questionable, whereby the default CO2 yield from this oxidation, as far as GHG metrics are concerned, should be 100%. We re-calculate values for the global warming potential (GWP) metric in accordance with our findings, resulting in an increase in GWP100 from 29.8 and 27.0–30.40 and 27.65 kg CO2-equivalents/kg fossil and biogenic methane, respectively.

To this day, undisturbed tropical forests act as a carbon sink by taking up about 15% of anthropogenic carbon emissions per year. However, in the past decades, a declining trend in the carbon sink capacity in the Amazon rainforest has been observed due to increased carbon losses and tree mortality. The causes are disputed, but increasing temperatures and more frequent severe droughts are potentially major drivers. We employ a novel modeling framework and hypothesize that previously rare, extreme droughts in the Amazon, such as the ones in 2005 and 2010, constitute the main cause behind the decline of the net carbon sink in aboveground biomass. Our dynamic vegetation model simulates process-based plant hydraulics and drought-induced mortality, and accounts for the diversity of strategies in plant responses to drought based on observed hydraulic vulnerability curves. The simulated impact of the 2005 drought event temporarily turned the annual Amazon net carbon sink to a carbon source of about 0.25 Mg C  . In contrast to other dynamic vegetation models our model simulated an increasing trend in carbon losses and a declining trend in the Amazon carbon sink over the past 25 years (net sink rate of −0.015 Mg C  or −0.18 Mg C  per decade) which corresponds well with long-term forest monitoring data (net sink rate of −0.016 Mg C  ). We show that this trend is entirely attributable to drought-induced forest mortality during extreme years. The simulations show a threshold-like behavior between drought intensity and biomass loss, which is due to xylem vulnerability, indicating the potentially high sensitivity of Amazon forests to extreme drought. Further increases in the severity and frequency of droughts might thus lead to greater carbon release and tree mortality than previously assumed."

Communities adjacent to such sources are disproportionately exposed to air pollution from these stationary and mobile sources. One such community is West San Bernardino in California, where households are feet away from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe intermodal facility and are impacted by activities that are estimated to continuously emit air pollutants due to 24/7 operation. This study aimed to (1) quantify the impact of personal mobility and housing characteristics on daily PM2.5 exposures and well-being for West San Bernardino community members, and (2) develop individualized resilience plans for community collaborators to support future PM2.5 exposure reduction. Personal PM2.5 exposures were measured for community collaborators for seven consecutive days during three deployment periods: October 2021, January 2022, and March 2022. Indoor and ambient PM2.5 levels were also continuously measured for five households over six months using PurpleAir Classic monitors. Demographic and well-being data were collected upon recruitment and after each week of engagement, respectively. Personal exposures in home microenvironments were highest near the railyard and lower farthest away from the railyard. Home exposures were 40% higher on average compared to non-home microenvironments. Household PM2.5 had a higher-than-expected average infiltration factor of 0.55, and indoor 98th percentiles across the households far exceeded a healthy level at an average of 165 μg m3. Resilience plans featured summaries of personal data and recommendations for mitigating exposures. Results suggest that surrounding land use and residential building characteristics compound to worsen air pollution exposures beyond what is expected for exposures in non-industrialized areas. Findings prompt a call for stronger regulation, not only for emissions, but also for indoor air quality and zoning standards that specifically protect disproportionately impacted communities."

This information is key for improving the understanding of these clouds, as they do contain ice and liquid water simultaneously, making them relevant for the precipitation budget and radiative balance of the Earth's atmosphere. The retrieval is based on elevation scans of polarimetric cloud radars and can therefore be flexibly applied. 
 To date, there remains a noticeable gap in reliable techniques for retrieving the shape and orientation of ice particles from observational data. This paper introduces a method using ground-based polarimetric cloud radar to retrieve the shape and orientation of multiple hydrometeor types within deep mixed-phase clouds. Building on the strong performance of an existing method, which is effective in retrieving the shape and orientation of pristine ice particles in stratiform clouds, we extended this technique by analyzing the entire Doppler spectrum. The previously developed main-peak approach focuses on the maximum of the Doppler spectrum to retrieve the shape and orientation of the dominant hydrometeor types within stratiform clouds. In the extended technique, referred to as the spectrally resolved technique, the full Doppler spectrum is analyzed by dividing it into five parts, ultimately allowing the retrieval of five distinct hydrometeor types. In this study, we employed the technique for Range-Height Indicator (RHI) scans (ranging from 30° to 90° elevation) utilizing polarimetric Ka-band cloud radar observations of differential reflectivity (ZDR) and correlation coefficient (RHV) across the entire Doppler spectrum. The potential of the improved approach is presented by means of two case studies. The first case demonstrates the effectiveness of the spectrally resolved approach and in the second case secondary ice production is investigated. These findings contribute to a profound understanding of hydrometeor characteristics, shedding light on dynamic cloud processes, especially in the context of precipitation and ice particle formation."

The dataset reflects unique horizontal and height spatial characteristics and hourly temporal variations of aircraft emissions and the impact of COVID-19 on the emissions, providing essential information for environmental analysis and policy decisions. 
 The rapid growth of the aviation industry has resulted in aircraft emissions during landing and takeoff (LTO), which have direct and increasingly adverse impacts on air quality and human health. An accurate and high-resolution LTO emission inventory is crucial for investigating these adverse effects, with the LTO emission having unique three-dimensional spatial characteristics and typical hourly temporal variations. This study integrated the emission calculation and flight trajectory recognition methods to establish a four-dimensional aircraft emission inventory dataset of China’s LTO cycle (4D-LTO emission inventory dataset) from 2019 to 2023. The dataset has a high spatial-temporal resolution (hourly, 0.03° × 0.03° × 34 height layers) and incorporates calculation emissions accurately. Moreover, the actual taxi out/in time for each flight was determined by a statistical model of taxi time and some aircraft in schedule based on 38,000,000 flights. Each flight’s climb/approach time was also obtained based on mixing layer height (MLH) and the height-time nonlinear relationship. Additionally, we calculated the LTO emission for China’s flight, establishing the hourly emission inventory based on each mode’s running time, emission index, and fuel flow. We obtained the flight trajectory core of each airport based on measured flight trajectories and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to depict the spatial distribution. Then, each flight’s takeoff/landing direction and trajectory were identified from the wind direction and relative departure/arrival airport position. The findings indicate that the impact of COVID-19 has reduced the LTO number in 2020–2022 to 73.1 %, 77.6 %, and 48.7 % of 2019 levels, respectively. However, by 2023, the LTO number has rapidly bounced back to 95.3 % of 2019 levels. The recovery rate during daytime (6:00–23:00) was 41.6 % higher than night-time (0:00–5:00). The emissions of various pollutants were measured as follows: HC, CO, NOx, PM, and SO2 are 3.2 Gg, 46.1 Gg, 62.3 Gg, 1.1 Gg and 18.4 Gg. LTO emissions’ horizontal characteristic is the distance along the runway and spread. This elongated distribution will be hidden if a rough grid (e.g., 0.36°×0.36°) and the emissions are evenly distributed. Moreover, LTO emissions height characteristic ‘decreases with height,’ and the maximum height varies with MLH. Emissions above the standard height set by the International Civil Aviation Organization standard height (~915 m) are not estimated. For example, NOx emissions above 915 m during various months make up an average of 24.6 % (9.9 %–37.5 %) in the LTO cycle, indicating the emissions are significantly underestimated when using the ICAO method. Compared with conventional spatial allocation methods, our dataset provides a more accurate representation of the actual LTO situation in both horizontal and height at different times. Our 4D-LTO emission inventory dataset and its adaptable methodology are valuable resources for researching temporal and spatial variations, air quality, and health impacts of aircraft emissions in the LTO cycle. The dataset can be accessed from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13908440 (Lang et al., 2024)."

Herein, in situ measurements inside a coal-fired steel plant were performed by multiple advanced lidars from 21 May to 21 June of 2021 in Yuncheng, Shanxi Province, China. Comparing with an adjacent meteorological site, we found a prominent nighttime dry heat island overhead of the factory, which was 3–10 °C hotter and 30%–60% drier than the surrounding fields. Large-eddy simulations constrained by the measured thermal contrast suggested that the heat-island-induced circulation could upward transport factory-discharged pollutants and horizontally spread them below the residual layer top, forming a mushroom-shaped cloud. The shape, size, and pollutant loading of the cloud were highly determined by thermodynamic variables such as aerodynamic wind and anthropogenic heat flux. Furthermore, these retained residual-layer pollutants can be convected downward to the ground after sunrise through the fumigation effect, causing the peaking phenomena aboveground.

While measuring high-altitude cloud is challenging, fog as ground-level clouds offer a unique opportunity for direct observation. In this study, we explored radiation fogs in the North China Plain using an advanced aerosol-fog sampling system to measure the chemical and physical properties of both inactivated interstitial aerosols and activated fog droplet residues. Our findings revealed that efficient nitrate formation primarily occurred on fog interstitial aerosols rather than within fog droplets, with observed fog interstitial aerosol nitrate net production rates reaching up to 3.6 μg m–3 h–1. Box model simulations identified the hydrolysis of NO2 and N2O5 as key pathways for nitrate formation. NO2 hydrolysis was often overlooked in previous studies, contributing 40–79 and 57–76% to total nitrate production during nighttime and daytime fog periods. This oversight suggests that substantial nitrate formation through hydrolysis reactions involving interstitial aerosols may have been neglected. Our results highlight the need for further research into the chemistry of cloud and fog interstitial aerosols and their inclusion in atmospheric chemistry models."

Temerin,Earth‐Based Transmitters Trigger Precipitation of Inner Radiation Belt Electrons: Unveiling Observations and Modeling Results,"Human activity influence Earth's environment, including the space environment hundreds to thousands of kilometers above the Earth. One direct evidence is that the 19.8 kHz electromagnetic signals launched by the North West Cape (NWC) transmitter station in Australia produce a wisp‐like energy distribution of precipitating energetic electrons in Earth's inner radiation belt, observed by many Low Earth Orbiting satellites. Typically, satellites observe a single wisp with energy that decreases with increasing L (approximately the radial distance in the equatorial plane), which is produced by a first‐order cyclotron resonance of transmitter signals with energetic electrons. Here we report, for the first time, multiple wisps observed by the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment‐2 (REPTile‐2) on board the recently launched Colorado Inner Radiation Belt Experiment (CIRBE) CubeSat. Based on simulation results, we demonstrate that harmonic cyclotron resonances including the 1, −1, and 2 orders by highly oblique NWC transmitter signals produce these multiple wisps. The discovery of multiple‐order cyclotron resonances simultaneously occurring in space sheds new light on wave‐particle interactions in near‐Earth space. It also has implications for developing artificial radiation belt remediation techniques and understanding the propagation and scattering of plasma waves in planetary magnetospheres."

Shaw;Lantao Sun,Anthropogenic Aerosols Have Significantly Weakened the Regional Summertime Circulation in the Northern Hemisphere During the Satellite Era,"Reanalysis data show a significant weakening of summertime circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes in the satellite era with implications for surface weather extremes. Recent work showed the weakening is not significantly affected by changes in the Arctic, but did not examine the role of different anthropogenic forcings such as aerosols. Here we use the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) simulations to quantify the impact of anthropogenic aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing. The DAMIP simulations show aerosols and greenhouse gases contribute equally to zonal‐mean circulation weakening. Regionally, aerosol dominates the Pacific storm track weakening whereas greenhouse gas dominates in the Atlantic. Using a regional energetic framework, we show why the impact of aerosol is the largest in the Pacific. Reduced sulfate aerosol emissions over Eurasia and North America increase (clear‐sky) surface shortwave radiation and turbulent fluxes. This enhances land‐to‐ocean energy contrast and energy transport via stationary circulations to the ocean. Consequently, energy converges poleward of oceanic storm tracks, demanding weaker poleward energy transport storm tracks, and the storm tracks weaken. The impact is larger over the Pacific following the larger emission decrease over Eurasia than North America. Similar yet opposite, increased aerosol emissions over South and East Asia decrease shortwave radiation and weaken land‐to‐ocean energy transport. This diverges energy equatorward of the Pacific storm track, further weakening it. Our results show aerosols are a dominant driver of regional circulation weakening during the NH summertime in the satellite era and a regional energetic framework explaining the underlying processes."

The algorithm effectively constrains dust activity and guarantees precise tracking through using satellite and reanalysis‐based estimates. The high‐altitude airborne dust over the TP shows considerable spatial variation and primarily comes from the desert clusters in Central Asia, West Asia, and South Asia.

High‐dimensional model representation is used to disentangle the contributions of SM and other land‐surface and atmospheric variables to the CVP. Results show that the sign and strength of the SM‐cloud‐precipitation feedback varies with cloud height and time lag and displays a large spatial variability.

We reveal different modeled SMB by 2100, including a twofold larger annual surface mass loss in MAR (−1735 Gt/yr) and HIRHAM (−1698 Gt/yr) relative to RACMO (−964 Gt/yr). Discrepancies primarily stem from differences in projected runoff, triggering melt‐albedo positive feedback and subsequent modeled ablation zone expansion.

This study utilizes observational data to assess TC‐environment interactions, such as atmospheric drying, stabilization, and oceanic cooling, which occur after TC passage and inhibit subsequent TC formation. Focused on the recovery of TC‐induced hostile environment, we construct an idealized toy model incorporating the global main development region (MDR), recovery time and influencing radius. The model well captures the spatial and temporal characteristics of TC activity. Then we propose a new scaling of annual TC number, framed as a spatiotemporal packing problem determined by the total spatiotemporal area available for TC formation and the average area occupied by each TC. The recovery time is included as a new temporal constraint, and this scaling is validated by toy model simulations and offers insights into observations. Specifically, based on TC attributes in the current climate, the scaling yields an estimate of ∼100 TCs per year given a recovery time of 2–3 weeks. It also implies that a warming climate might lead to fewer TCs due to increased TC size and longer recovery times."

 Surface ozone (O3) has become a primary pollutant affecting urban air quality and public health in mainland China. To address this concern, we developed a nation-wide surface maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) O3 concentration dataset for mainland China (ChinaHighO3) at a 10-km resolution with a start year of 2013, which has been widely employed in a wide range of studies. To meet the increasing demand for its usage, we have made important enhancements, including the development of a more advanced deep-learning model and the incorporation of major source updates, such as 1-km surface downward shortwave radiation and temperature directly from satellite retrievals, as well as a 1-km emission inventory. Additionally, we have extended the temporal coverage dating back to 2000, increased the spatial resolution to 1 km, and most importantly, notably improved the data quality (e.g., sample-based cross-validation coefficient of determination = 0.89, and root-mean-square error = 15.77 μg/m3). Using the substantially improved new product, we have found dynamic and diverse patterns in national surface O3 levels over the past two decades. Peak-season levels have been relatively stable from 2000 to 2015, followed by a sharp increase, reaching peak values in 2019 and subsequently declining. Additionally, we observed a large relative difference of 12 % in peak-season surface O3 concentrations between urban and rural regions in mainland China. This disparity has greatly increased since 2015, particularly in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Pearl River Delta regions. Notably, since 2000, nearly all of the population across mainland China (> 99.7 %) has resided in areas exposed to surface O3 pollution exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended long-term air quality guideline (AQG) level (peak-season MDA8 O3 = 60 μg/m3). Moreover, the short-term population-risk exposure to daily surface O3 pollution has shown a significant increasing trend of 1.2 % (p < 0.001) of the days exceeding the WHO's recommended short-term AQG level (daily MDA8 O3 = 100 μg/m3) per year during the 22-year period. The overall upward trend (0.73 μg/m3/yr, p < 0.001) in peak-season surface O3 pollution has led to an exceptionally large rate of increase of 953 (95 % confidence interval: 486, 1288) premature deaths per year from 2000 to 2021 in mainland China. Urgent action is required to develop comprehensive strategies aimed at mitigating surface O3 pollution to enhance air quality in the future."

 On 17 March 2018 major grassland fires in south-west Victoria, Australia ignited several peat bogs. The peat fires smouldered for 40 days, generating substantial amounts of smoke. The surrounding communities were exposed to significant concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5), resulting in the need for active interventions (such as the relocation of schools) in order to protect vulnerable communities.The peat fires provided a unique opportunity to review the capabilities of two air pollution forecasting models to assess the impact from the peat fires on nearby communities: the Air Quality Forecasting System (AQFx) and the Accident Reporting and Guiding Operational System (ARGOS). Both systems are used in Victoria to inform emergency management response strategies and community warnings.A key configuration change was made to the smoke emissions module in AQFx from simulating emissions from a planned burn to a sub-surface peat fire. Emissions were derived by using heat maps generated from aerial imagery data and estimates of fuel load determined by the peat bulk density and depth of the peat.The results indicated that AQFx successfully captured most smoke plume events during the simulation period, despite some errors in timing and magnitude. Accurate forecasting was most challenged by calm conditions, and meso-scale meteorological transition events. The ARGOS model performed better at capturing smoke plume dispersion during a meso-scale meteorological transition event due to meteorological forecasts being updated every 6 hours compared to a 24-hour update in AQFx. However, the source geometry in ARGOS meant that emission rates were concentrated within a small number of release points resulting in relatively narrow plumes with a likely overprediction of higher end PM2.5 concentrations. The AQFx system was better suited to area emissions.The ARGOS and AQFx models showed different strengths in providing timely information to emergency response agencies to better manage smoke impacts from smouldering peat fires on communities. The ARGOS model can be set up quickly with preliminary emission estimates that can be adjusted as more accurate and updated information becomes available. Compared to the ARGOS model, AQFx is better suited for area emissions. Implementation of a rapid update cycle in AQFx would further improve forecasts especially during meteorological transition events."

 A crucial factor limiting convective weather nowcasting is the lack of timely updated and accurate atmospheric water vapor observations. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can accurately sense water vapor with high temporal resolutions, which is adequate to observe many meso- and small-scale variations associated with convective weather. In this contribution, an hourly cycling data assimilation system is established to investigate the influence of assimilating GNSS zenith total delays (ZTD) on severe convective weather nowcasting. The contributions of assimilating ZTD with different temporal resolutions are discussed in detail by validating with the radiosonde observations. The results demonstrate that the assimilation of ZTD significantly improves the moisture distribution of the middle and lower troposphere. Furthermore, model simulations become wetter or drier as the frequency of ZTD assimilation increases. Verification of the precipitation forecasts is performed by comparing them with the radar-estimated precipitation. The results indicate that assimilation of GNSS ZTD improves the accuracy of precipitation forecast in the nowcasting range of 0–6 h. Compared to the control experiment, the hourly ZTD assimilation experiment reveals the highest precipitation forecast skill scores, followed by the experiments of assimilating ZTD every three and six hours, indicating that the rapid update of water vapor information could contribute to improving the precipitation nowcasting in a rapidly developing convective system."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107782,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了长江中下游流域梅雨期结束后热浪发生的加速现象。研究发现，2001年至2022年期间，该流域快速发生的热浪比例显著增加，这与西太平洋副热带高压的快速西移密切相关。西太平洋副热带高压的西边界快速西伸，控制长江中下游流域，形成Ω型环流结构，阻挡冷空气入侵，并通过向下短波辐射增强位势高度，从而导致热穹顶的形成，加速热浪的发生和持续。该研究利用地面观测数据和梅雨监测数据，结合统计分析和环流分析，揭示了热浪加速发生的机制。虽然文章中没有直接提及具体的遥感技术或卫星传感器，但其研究内容与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如，可以通过气象卫星观测西太平洋副热带高压的位置和强度变化，利用遥感技术监测地表温度和大气温度廓线等，从而更好地理解和预测热浪的发生发展。,"['geopotential height', 'air temperature', 'western Pacific subtropical high', 'heatwave', 'meteorological satellites', 'atmospheric circulation', 'remote sensing', 'reanalysis data']",Wei Jiang;Ting Ding;Hui Gao,Accelerating onset of heatwaves after the Meiyu termination in the middle-lower Yangtze River basin,"•The MLYR basin represents the most significant region in China experiencing a flood-heatwave alternation; •In the 21st century the MLYR is experiencing an accelerating heatwave onset after its Meiyu termination; •Rapid westward shift of the WPSH plays the major role by producing a swift heat-dome effect. 
 This study employs station observation and Meiyu monitoring data in the middle-lower Yangtze River (MLYR) basin to investigate a distinctive heatwave phenomenon, characterized by an accelerated onset following the Meiyu termination in 2001–2022. In the basin, the proportion of rapid heatwaves (transition duration less than two days) is 30 % in the period 1981–2000, while it increased markedly to 77 % in the period 2001–2022. Furthermore, the accelerating onset of heatwaves in the basin is not limited to the surface. The results of the statistical analysis demonstrate the significant influence of circulations in the middle-low troposphere. In comparison to the circulations observed during the period between 1981 and 2000, the geopotential height (GPH) over the basin displays a considerable increase between 300 and 700 hPa following the termination of Meiyu in the later period. Additionally, there is a notable acceleration in the warming of the lower troposphere. The abrupt evolution of the circulation patterns resulted in the formation of a rapid heat-dome effect over the entire basin. This effect persists even when the warming trend of air temperatures and the enhancing trend of GPHs are removed. The heat-dome effect is closely associated with the rapid shift of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), particularly its western boundary. The rapid westward extension of the WPSH after the Meiyu event and its subsequent control of the MYLR basin form an “Ω”-shape circulation structure, which block the cold air invasion from high latitudes and enhance the geopotential heights by downward shortwave radiation, to induce the heat dome over the basin. This, in turn, will accelerate the onset and persistence of heatwaves."

Here we reported evidence for a double‐peak superposition at the EIA crest of each hemisphere, forming a four‐peak structure, with the additional peaks located ∼10° poleward of normal crests, as observed by CSES at 500 km altitudes on dayside, during the 23 April 2023 geomagnetic storm. Such a unique structure occurred when the eastward prompt penetration electric field (PPEF) was developed. Interestingly, distinctive large‐scale traveling ionospheric disturbances derived from GNSS‐TEC data propagated equatorward but not coincidently interacted with the EIA poleward peaks. The short‐duration intense PPEF may be the most plausible mechanism, which could cause the “fountain” plasma highly elevated into the topside which gradually fell into CSES altitudes on poleward sides of regular EIA crests, causing the superposition of crest in addition to nominal crest generated by the regular wind dynamo."

Improving constraints on the drivers of such extreme events is key to understanding glacier change around the continent and future sea‐level rise. We use satellite remote sensing and reanalysis data to characterize changes in Hektoria, a former Larsen B Ice Shelf tributary, over the last ∼20 years and document a period of retreat from 2002 to 2011, and readvancement from 2011 to 2022. We find that the long‐term ice front and velocity response (2002–2022) correlated more strongly with changes in modeled ocean temperatures compared to surface air temperatures. However, the acute loss of buttressing support following fast ice collapse paired with a near‐contemporaneous extreme atmospheric river in the region likely catalyzed the unprecedented 2022–2023 retreat."

Crow;Lingna Wei;Huiwen Zhang,The Conditional Bias of Extreme Precipitation in Multi‐Source Merged Data Sets,"Multi‐source data merging via weighted average (WA) is widely applied to enhance large‐scale precipitation estimates. However, these data sets usually contain substantial conditional biases with respect to extreme precipitation (EP) events—undermining their utility for extreme event analysis. Nevertheless, the main source of such EP biases remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that WA algorithms are responsible for less than 1% of total EP biases. Instead, EP biases originate from the multi‐source precipitation inputs, which are not adequately adjusted prior to WA. Specifically, current data‐merging frameworks only correct the monthly means or statistical distributions of the remote sensing/reanalysis precipitation inputs prior to WA. Such procedures are insufficient for adjusting EP timing uncertainties, which eventually propagate into the WA‐based merged data set as an EP bias. Therefore, developing algorithms that iteratively adjust EP timing and intensity errors should be prioritized in future precipitation merging frameworks."

To understand what caused the time‐evolving comparison between GHG and AER response patterns, we apply a low‐frequency component analysis to historical surface ocean changes from CESM1 single‐forcing large‐ensemble simulations. While GHG response is characterized by its first leading mode, AER response consists of two distinct modes. The first one, featuring long‐term global AER increase and global cooling, opposes GHG response patterns up to the mid‐twentieth century. The second one, featuring multidecadal variations in AER distributions and interhemispheric asymmetric surface ocean changes, appears to reinforce the GHG warming effect over recent decades. AER thus can have both competing and synergistic effects with GHG as their emissions change temporally and spatially."

We find that the electron density above the exobase is anticorrelated with the ratio of solar wind's normal dynamic pressure (PSW⊥ ${P}_{\text{SW}\perp }$) to CMF magnetic pressure (PCMF ${P}_{\text{CMF}}$). We also analyze the electron density behavior across different magnetic topologies as a function of PSW⊥/PCMF ${P}_{\text{SW}\perp }/{P}_{\text{CMF}}$. The extremely low electron density in the draped topology relates to ionopause‐like structures. The lower electron density in the closed and open topology under higher PSW⊥/PCMF ${P}_{\text{SW}\perp }/{P}_{\text{CMF}}$ may be attributed to a downward force, potentially the J × B force in the case of closed topology.

Here, we examine for acceleration and explore possible causes for regional differences using gridded surface temperature data. We find that global and regional warming is accelerating, and on average, regions with low Human Development Index (HDI) experienced much higher accelerated warming in comparison to regions with high HDI. However, some regions of low HDI with a large population experienced slow acceleration due to high local aerosol emissions. Since aerosol negative forcing impacts are short‐lived and localized, rapid future reduction of aerosol emissions without a concurrent reduction in GHG emissions could have major compounding impacts. Such a pathway, similar to most 21st century scenarios, could expose a large fraction of the world's most vulnerable people to sudden warming acceleration and heat stress associated impacts. These results call for targeted climate adaptation strategies directing attention to low‐socioeconomic aerosol masked regions."

However, contributions of aerosol‐PBL interactions to future air quality benefits remain unclear. Here we conduct ensemble experiments using the variable‐resolution (VR) Community Atmosphere Model with full chemistry based on the scalable spectral element (SE) dynamical core with East Asia refined to ∼28 km (SE_VR). Additional simulations at a uniform resolution of ∼111 km (SE_UR) are conducted to help demonstrate SE_VR's advantages in projecting future air quality. Results of SE_VR show that the mean PM2.5 concentrations in China would drop to below 10 μg/m3, especially in Sichuan Basin (SCB) where the frequencies of moderate and severe air pollution events are predicted to decrease from 60.7% and 11.3% to nearly zero respectively when achieving carbon neutrality. The aerosol‐PBL interactions would be substantially weakened with anthropogenic emission reductions. At SCB and Eastern China (EC), the weakened radiative effects of black carbon (BC) would contribute 34.3% and 71.6% to the increase in PBL height (PBLH). Consequently, these weakened BC‐PBL interactions reduce the surface PM2.5 concentrations by 16.1 μg/m3 (18.9%) in SCB and 4.6 μg/m3 (16.4%) in EC. Notably, SE_VR outperforms SE_UR in projecting the frequency decrease of future air pollution events for its better reproducing current levels, particularly those caused by BC aerosols. This study highlights the importance of weakened aerosol‐PBL feedbacks on future air quality improvement and demonstrates the added values of variable‐resolution global models in air quality projections."

This mechanism was investigated in a set of wind tunnel experiments with the purpose of examining the rate of comminution during transport, role of bed roughness, influence of humidity, system dynamics, and proportionate amount of dust production. The playa sediment selected for testing was obtained from Owens Lake in California, USA. Particle aggregates with diameters between 500 and 710 μm (0.5 ϕ–1.0 ϕ) were isolated by sieving. Small 20 g subsamples were then introduced into the wind tunnel via a drop tube, with some particles captured on a downwind array of sticky glass plates. Aggregate diameter was found to decrease linearly by 30–56 μm per meter of transport (r2 = 0.43) over a total distance of 8.3 m. Enhanced geometric roughness of the bed surface increased this rate, but not dust production and suspension. As compared to an equivalent mass of disaggregated parent material representing the dust emission potential, comminution produced only 0.5%–4% as much suspended PM10. Weak longitudinal flow instabilities involving downwelling and upwelling were found to influence the vertically integrated mass transport rate. This affirms the high sensitivity of dust transport to the structure of the wind field and the need for a paradigm shift in wind tunnel simulations of dust emission to extend measurement of the factors governing dispersion beyond one dimension, and specifically, friction velocity."

We build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the occurrence of cloud‐to‐ground (CG) lightning across the WUS during June–September from the spatial patterns of seven large‐scale meteorological variables from reanalysis (1995–2022). Individually trained CNN models at each 1° × 1° grid cell (n = 285 CNNs) show high skill at predicting CG lightning days across the WUS (median AUC = 0.8) and perform best in parts of the interior Southwest where summertime CG lightning is most common. Further, interannual correlation between observed and predicted CG lightning days is high (median r = 0.87), demonstrating that locally trained CNNs realistically capture year‐to‐year variation in CG lightning activity across the WUS. We then use layer‐wise relevance propagation (LRP) to investigate the relevance of predictor variables to successful CG lightning prediction in each grid cell. Using maximum LRP values, our results show that two thermodynamic variables—ratio of surface moist static energy to free‐tropospheric saturation moist static energy, and the 700–500 hPa lapse rate—are the most relevant CG lightning predictors for 93%–96% of CNNs depending on the LRP variant used. As lightning is not directly simulated by global climate models, these CNNs could be used to parameterize CG lightning in climate models to assess changes in future CG lightning occurrence with projected climate change. Understanding changes in CG lightning risk and consequently lightning‐caused wildfire risk across the WUS could inform fire management, planning, and disaster preparedness."

A Gaussian plume (GP) model was used to evaluate the power plant emissions reported in the Carbon Brief (CB) database. In total (39 cases), 42 different power plant CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ emissions were assessed, with 26 of them being assessed more than once. The estimated power plant CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ emissions were within ± $\pm $ 25% of the emissions reported in the CB database in 11 out of 39 cases and within ± $\pm $ 50% in 18 cases. To evaluate the EDGAR and ODIAC CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ emission inventories in terms of missing and highly underestimated sources, we estimated the cross‐sectional (CS) CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ emission flux for 45 cases. We identified the possible omission of power plant emissions in three cases for both inventories. Furthermore, we also showed 17 cases in which CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ emissions from unknown (non‐power plant) sources were highly underestimated in the EDGAR and ODIAC CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ emission inventories. Due to the simplicity of the employed approaches and their lower computational requirements compared to other methods, they can be applied to large data sets over extended time periods. This enables the acquisition of initial emission estimates for various sources, including those that are unknown and underestimated."

 The product of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation and photosynthetic active radiation (NIRvP) is a new tool for monitoring gross primary productivity (GPP) dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, due to the discovered linear correlation between NIRvP and GPP. While remote sensing-based NIRvP is considerably influenced by sensor geometry, such geometry impacts on the NIRvP-GPP relationship remain underexplored. In this study, we calculate NIRvP using observations from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) that provide unique hotspot observation geometry in which the sensor viewing angle coincides with the sun direction. We evaluated the linear correlation between NIRvP and GPP in both the common nadir direction and the special hotspot direction. The results indicate that NIRvP in the hotspot direction significantly outperforms that in the nadir direction for tracking GPP variations across different ecosystems from diurnal to daily scales. This conclusion is further supported by data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and simulations using the Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis Energy (SCOPE) model. Our research highlights the value of using the unconventional hotspot-based sun-tracking satellite observations for a more accurate characterization of GPP dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems."

 In recent years, extreme climate has increasingly triggered record boreal wildfires. The year 2023 saw a significant surge in wildfire occurrences in Canada, far surpassing the historical record. In this study, multi-source data were utilized for a comprehensive analysis of the development of the Canadian wildfires in 2023, the pathways of wildfire smoke, and its impact on the air quality in the US. The results indicate that the 2023 Canadian wildfires mainly occurred in western Canada (accounting for 60% of the burned area) and Quebec (eastern Canada, 29% of the burned area). Weather systems played a key role throughout wildfires and smoke plume transport processes. Specifically, high temperatures and dry weather caused by the blocking high-pressure systems was conducive to the enhancement of wildfire activities. Additionally, the southward airflow ahead of the ridge facilitated the transport of wildfires plume towards the south. This transport pattern frequently manifests under the Weather Regimes (WR) associated with the Alaskan Ridge (AkR) and Arctic High (ArH). In May and July, the smoke originating from the wildfires in western Canada, guided by the North American trough, affected the midwestern US. In June, smoke from eastern Canada led to severe air pollution in the northeastern US. Throughout the wildfire season, particulate matter dominated pollution in the US.

 Significant PM2.5 pollution has been prevalent on a regional scale in East Asia including a megacity Seoul in South Korea. Here, we explore fine-aerosol episodes occurred in Seoul during the Satellite Integrated Joint monitoring of Air Quality (SIJAQ) campaign from October to November of the 2021, focusing on experimental evidences of heterogeneous reactions to form secondary aerosol under a highly oxidized atmospheric condition.At this urban site in Seoul, vehicle exhaust was the clear source of fresh emissions, leading to a high level of NO and small refractory black carbon (rBC) particles (mass median diameter of 162 nm ± 16 nm) in the morning time. The hourly mass concentration of PM2.5 ranged from 5.3 μg m−3 to 146.1 μg m−3, averaging at 24.5 ± 22.2 μg m−3. During the campaign, the most intense episode, EP3 (November 18–21), recorded an average PM2.5 concentration of 72.5 ± 38.2 μg m−3, peaking at 146.1 μg m−3, was characterized by relatively higher temperature (∼12 °C) and relative humidity (67 %) on average thoroughly governed by continental migratory high and westerly winds. While the average NO3− concentration was 27.7 μg m−3, four times the whole campaign's average, EP3 was highlighted by a high morning NO2/NOx ratio and significantly elevated daytime and nighttime Ox (O3+NO2) concentrations compared to non-episode days. Throughout the entire campaign, NOz surrogate (NO2(CL)-NO2(T)), Ox, and Fmoderate + thick (the combined number fractions of moderately and thickly coated-rBC particles) tended to increase with the PM2.5 concentration. During the daytime, as PM2.5 increased, Fmoderate + thick showed a monotonic increase, accompanied by RH rising from 54 ± 16% to 63 ± 11%. In contrast, at nighttime of humid condition with RH often exceeding 70% the enhancement of Fmoderate + thick was more sensitive to condensable gas levels than RH. Given that high levels of PM2.5 (>60 μg m−3) were observed only during EP3, enhanced levels of NOz surrogate, Ox, Fmoderate + thick, and RH were evident characteristics of EP3. Such chemical and meteorological conditions suggest that the chemically enhanced oxidation state was evident during EP3, which promoted the formation of secondary aerosols on primary particles including rBC, especially under conditions of elevated RH. Considering the recent trend of increasing number of vehicles and rising atmospheric O3 concentrations in East Asia, future studies should be well designed to investigate the detailed mechanisms involved in heterogeneous reactions that lead to the formation of secondary aerosols."

 The remnant inland circulation of Typhoon Doksuri induced catastrophic heavy precipitation in July 2023 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area of China. The role of climate trends in this event is investigated using the pseudo-global warming approach. The control experiment driven by the ERA5 reanalysis captures the intensity and spatial distribution of the heavy precipitation reasonably well. The effects of climate trends are investigated by removing climate trends in various variables from the boundary and initial conditions of the sensitivity experiments. The warming trend of sea surface temperature is found to enhance extreme precipitation intensity, while the specific humidity trend, which is positive over the ocean but negative in some inland regions, has negligible impacts on inland extreme precipitation. The impacts of atmospheric dynamic trends are found to be predominant, which alter the track of the remnant circulation, reduce precipitation intensity, and substantially change the spatial distribution of precipitation. This study highlights the importance of considering atmospheric dynamic trends when assessing the impacts of climate trends on typhoon remnant circulations over land, which may lead to extreme precipitation in regions that have rarely experienced such extremes before."

 Summer precipitation over the Maritime Continent (MC) is tightly connected to livelihoods of the locals, and the corresponding strong convective activities are also crucial to Asian regional climate variations remotely. Using observational and reanalysis data from 1958 to 2020, we found that El Niño with different decay rates can cause different summer precipitation anomalies in the MC area. In the fast decaying (FD) El Niño summer, the MC area shows a precipitation surplus, while the MC precipitation decreases during the slow decaying (SD) El Niño summer. For the FD El Niño, the equatorial central-eastern Pacific warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly quickly turns into cold in the decaying summer, while the SST over MC region sustains a warm anomaly owing to the Indo-western Pacific Ocean capacitor effect. This local warm SST anomaly leads to anomalous ascent and then excessive precipitation, further stimulating low-level easterly wind to east of the MC with increased water vapor transport. For the SD El Niño, the central-eastern Pacific warm SST anomaly sustains till the decaying summer, continuously adjusting the Walker circulation. An anomalous local descent motion associated with the weakened Walker circulation region hampers the MC precipitation in summer. Our findings benefit the local researches of the MC summer climate variations, and potentially favor the regional climate predictions."

 Northeast Asia has experienced a significant drying trend since the 1950s. Attribution of this drying trend is important for understanding drying and its response to anthropogenic forcing. Despite increasing evidence of human influence on surface air temperature and precipitation, how human-induced climate change is affecting the observed aridity change is poorly understood. Here, by employing a “dynamical adjustment” methodology, we present an alternative estimation of the anthropogenic influence on drying trends over Northeast Asia during 1948–2010 from the observational records. Decomposition analysis revealed that the exacerbation of drying trends over Northeast Asia is largely driven by evapotranspiration forcing, which contributed to approximately 64 % of the drying trend and almost doubled that attributed to precipitation deficit. The acceleration of the drying trend by evapotranspiration forcing was mainly attributable to anthropogenic warming effect on potential evapotranspiration (PET). Considering the integrated effect of anthropogenic forcing on both PET and precipitation, the results showed that anthropogenic forcing has increased the extent of the drying trend area by ∼21 % over Northeast Asia during 1948–2010. In particular, the magnitudes of drying trends were significantly amplified by anthropogenic forcing, resulting in an expansion of the areas with enhanced drying trend by ∼43 %. These findings provide compelling evidence of a human influence on half century-scale drying trends over Northeast Asia, implying the overall likelihood of drought events increasing in this region due to anthropogenic forcing."

 The Tibetan Plateau, particularly the eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP), experienced extraordinarily high surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies in summer 2022. This study investigated the impact of anomalous soil moisture (SM) on the SAT over the ETP and explored the synergistic effect of SM and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on the ETP SAT during 1961–2022. It is found that the anomalous SM in the region from the eastern European Plain to the western Siberia Plain (EEP-WSP) remarkably affects the summer SAT over the ETP. Corresponding to lower EEP-WSP SM, the overlying upper-level higher geopotential height appears and stimulates downstream wave train from the EEP-WSP region to ETP, thereby affecting atmospheric circulation and associated SAT anomalies over the ETP. Since warmer SST anomalies in the Barents Sea and Black Sea contribute to the lower EEP-WSP SM anomalies (i.e., drier soil), the EEP-WSP SM can be considered a critical factor in bridging the Barents Sea and Black Sea SST anomalies and the ETP SAT. Moreover, the EEP-WSP SM can independently modulate the ETP SAT even when the effects of the SST anomalies are removed. The variability in the EEP-WSP SM is independent of that in the Yellow-Japan Sea (YJS) SST. Accordingly, the EEP-WSP SM and YJS SST can cooperatively and remarkably adjust the summer SAT over the ETP. The synergistic effect of EEP-WSP SM and YJS SST can regulate the ETP SAT on various (interannual, interdecadal, and trend) timescales and explain well the 2022 SAT anomaly over the ETP."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107784,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了云对行星边界层高度（PBLH）的影响。它利用2013年1月至2020年12月期间在南大平原地区收集到的激光雷达、无线电探空仪、云高仪和气象参数观测数据，分析了不同云况下白天和夜间PBLH的差异。研究发现，白天多云条件下PBLH较低，而夜间则较高。这是因为白天多云时，云层散射和吸收太阳辐射，导致净辐射、感热通量、地表温度和土壤温度降低，湍流强度减弱，相对湿度增加，从而抑制了PBLH的增长；夜间多云时，云层吸收和反射地表长波辐射，减缓了地表辐射冷却速率，增强了大气不稳定性和湍流强度，导致PBLH略高于晴天条件。该研究系统地阐明了云对PBLH演变的影响，有助于理解云对PBL结构的调制作用。研究中使用的激光雷达、无线电探空仪和云高仪等属于大气环境遥感技术。,"['planetary boundary layer height', 'cloud', 'lidar', 'radiosonde', 'ceilometer', 'meteorological parameters', 'atmospheric stability', 'radiation', 'turbulence']",Hui Li;Boming Liu;Wei Gong;Yingying Ma;Shikuan Jin;Weiyan Wang;Ruonan Fan;Shuailong Jiang,Influence of clouds on planetary boundary layer height: A comparative study and factors analysis,"•The PBLH is higher at night under cloudy conditions than under clear conditions. •Solar heating on clear days and turbulence on cloudy nights boost PBLH growth. •Mechanisms of cloud impacts on PBLH evolution are thoroughly explored. 
 Clouds are one of the key factors influencing the evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Understanding the complex interactions between clouds and PBL height (PBLH) is essential for accurately simulating and predicting PBL processes. This study investigates the impact of clouds on PBLH evolution based on the lidar, radiosonde, ceilometer, and meteorological parameters observations at the Southern Great Plains site during the period January 2013 to December 2020. The findings indicates that the presence of clouds has an impact on the evolution of the PBLH. During the daytime, PBLH is lower under cloudy conditions than clear conditions, whereas during nighttime, PBLH is higher under cloudy conditions. This phenomenon arises because the intense solar radiation on clear days and strong turbulent mixing on cloudy nights contribute to the formation and maintenance of PBLH. Furthermore, during the daytime, clouds scatter and absorb solar radiation, leading to lower net radiation (NetR), sensible heat flux (SHF), surface temperature (TEM), and soil temperature (SoilT). These conditions, coupled with weaker turbulence intensity and high relative humidity (RH), leading to lower PBLH under cloudy conditions. Although TEM and SoilT are relatively high during clear nights, rapid surface radiative cooling and strong atmospheric stability inhibit the development of the PBLH. Consequently, during cloudy nights, clouds absorb and reflect longwave radiation from the surface, reducing surface radiative cooling rates, enhancing atmospheric instability and turbulence intensity. Furthermore, higher NetR and SHF, along with decreased RH, result in slightly deeper PBLH compared to clear conditions. Overall, this study systematically elucidates the influence of clouds on PBLH evolution and contributes to the understanding of the modulation of cloud on PBL structure."

Using autocorrelation analysis, we create a block‐diagonal covariance matrix for the 1A dataset. We then apply a low‐pass Gaussian filter that integrates this covariance matrix into the least squares estimation, resulting in a refined 1B dataset that minimizes spikes and spurious accelerations while preserving measurement error.

However, research pertaining to the impact of heatwaves on vegetation productivity (VPu) and vegetation transpiration (VTu), along with their underlying drivers, particularly in urban areas, remains limited. This study investigates the response of VPu and VTu to heatwave events across 895 global cities from 1990 to 2022. The analysis reveals a notable upward trend in the average heatwave frequency, intensity, and duration across the global cities. Heatwave events demonstrate a detrimental impact on VPu and VTu, resulting in an average decrease of 28% and 26%, respectively, during heatwave occurrences. The attribution analysis reveals divergent driving factors for the decline in VPu and VTu during heatwaves. The decrease in VPu is primarily influenced by SM, contributing 60% to the downward trend of VPu during heatwaves. Notably, VPu displays a sharp downward trend when SM falls below 0.38 m3/m3. In contrast, the primary driver of VTu decline is VPD, contributing more than 66% to the downward trend of VTu during heatwave events. VTu exhibits a significant downward trend when VPD exceeds 1.35 kPa. The results of this study show the important effects of increasingly frequent heatwaves on vegetation transpiration and productivity, and that can be used as quantitative factor to be evaluated when investigating policy measures for the resilience of urban areas."

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the role of aerosol IN effect in the “21⋅7” Henan extreme precipitation event using two simulations based on an aerosol‐aware configuration of the WRF model. One prescribed spatially uniform ice nucleation particles (INP) concentration (labeled CTL), whereas the other incorporated MERRA2 aerosol concentration fields to represent a more realistic INP spatial distribution (labeled M2), which is marked by a west‐east gradient with higher INP concentration in the west. Results show that M2 simulated heavier precipitation near Zhengzhou closer to the observation regarding both spatial distribution and intensity than the CTL simulation. This improvement is attributed to an INP‐induced feedback akin to the aerosol lifetime effect. Specifically, the M2 simulation had higher INP concentration in the west, causing increased rates of heterogeneous ice nucleation as the convection progressed from west to east. This released additional latent heat, intensifying the convection and subsequently enhancing homogeneous ice nucleation, yielding more but smaller cloud ice particles in M2. These ice particles had reduced sedimentation speeds and lower aggregation rates, suppressing precipitation upstream of Zhengzhou. The intensified convection, carrying more water, propagated eastward, ultimately resulting in extremely heavy precipitation near Zhengzhou. This study underscores the aerosol IN effect on cloud microphysics, convection intensity, and regional rainfall distribution, elucidating the crucial role of aerosol‐meteorology coupling in accurately simulating moderate deep convective cloud precipitation."

This study refines the spatial resolution of the CAMS/LSCE inversion system, achieving a global resolution of 0.7° latitude and 1.4° longitude, or three times as many grid boxes as the current operational setup. In a 2‐year inversion assimilating the midday clear‐sky retrievals of the column‐averaged dry air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) from NASA's second Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO‐2), the elevated resolution demonstrates an improvement in the representation of atmospheric CO2, particularly at the synoptic timescale, as validated against independent surface measurements. Vertical profiles of the CO2 concentration differ slightly above 22 km between resolutions compared to AirCore profiles, and highlight differences in the vertical distribution of CO2 between resolutions. However, this disparity is not evident for XCO2, as evaluated against independent reference ground‐based observations. Global and regional estimates of natural fluxes for 2015–2016 are similar between the two resolutions, but with North America exhibiting a higher natural sink at high resolution for 2016. Overall, both inversions seem to yield reasonable estimates of global and regional natural carbon fluxes. The increase in calculation time is less than the increase in the number of operations and in the volume of input data, revealing greater efficiency of the code executed on a graphics processing unit. This allows us to make this higher resolution the new standard for the CAMS/LSCE system."

The simulation slightly underestimates radar‐estimated rainfall over the ∼3.5‐month evaluation period but underestimates stratiform rainfall by 46% and overestimates convective rainfall by 43%. As convective available potential energy (CAPE) increases, the convective rainfall overestimation decreases, but the stratiform rainfall underestimation increases such that the contribution of convective to total rainfall remains constantly high biased by ∼26%. Overestimated convective rainfall arises from the simulation generating 2.6 times more precipitating convective cells (14,299) than observed by radar (5,662) despite similar observed and simulated cell growth processes, with relatively wide cells contributing mostly to excessive convective rainfall. Relatively shallow cells, typically reaching heights of 4–7 km, contribute most to the cell number bias. This cell number bias increases as CAPE decreases, potentially because cells and their updrafts become narrower and more under‐resolved as CAPE decreases. The gross overproduction of precipitating shallow cells leads to overly efficient precipitation and inadequate detrainment of ice aloft, thereby diminishing the formation of robust stratiform rainfall regions. Decreasing model horizontal grid spacing from 3 to 1 or 0.333 km for low (<300 J kg−1) and high CAPE (>1,000 J kg−1) cases results in minimal change to cell number, depth, and convective‐to‐stratiform partitioning biases. This suggests that improving prediction of these convective properties depends on factors beyond solely increasing model resolution."

 Anisotropy of artificial light at night (ALAN) has been revealed from satellite observations, as Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS DNB) provides multi-angle measurements of ALAN. However, the knowledge behind this phenomenon is very limited. In this study, we hypothesize that vegetation phenology impacts the anisotropy of ALAN, which is defined as the change in radiant intensity with viewing zenith angle (VZA). The time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifying the vegetation phenology and Change Index (CI) quantifying the ALAN anisotropy were extracted from VNP13A1 and VNP46A2 products, respectively. We analyzed the effect of vegetation phenology by comparing the anisotropy of ALAN at the same location across different seasons in eleven suburban study areas in North America. The anisotropy of ALAN was found to exhibit obvious seasonal dynamic which is consistent with that of NDVI, and these two variables showed significant positive correlation at both pixel scale (0.41 < r < 0.79) and regional scale (0.56 < r < 0.92). Furthermore, we found that the seasonality of the ALAN anisotropy was significantly correlated with the seasonality of vegetation over the eleven study areas (r = 0.75). All these results suggest that vegetation growth can reduce the anisotropy of ALAN. In other words, vegetation growth leads to a more even distribution of emitted light in different directions, which supports our hypothesis. These findings are potentially useful to improve the quality of time series nighttime light data by angular normalization considering vegetation phenology and better build City Emission Function (CEF) for modeling astronomic light pollution."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107806,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇研究论文探讨了北大西洋和海洋大陆海表温度异常对中国东北玉米产量的影响。文章指出，春末夏初的严重干旱对玉米生长造成严重损害，而北大西洋和海洋大陆的SST异常是导致中国东北夏季干旱的重要前兆因素。北大西洋的SST异常可以通过激发罗斯比波影响中国东北，而海洋大陆的SST异常则可以通过东亚-太平洋遥相关影响东亚急流，最终导致中国东北土壤水分减少。研究人员利用北大西洋和海洋大陆的春季SST异常作为预测指标，成功建立了中国东北玉米产量的预测模型，该模型具有较高的预测精度。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星遥感观测到的SST数据来分析气候变化对农业生产的影响，这属于利用遥感技术进行气候监测和农业预测的应用。,"['Sea surface temperature (SST)', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Climate change', 'Drought monitoring', 'Maize yield prediction', 'Atmospheric circulation', 'Teleconnection']",Sichao Yan;Huopo Chen,The significant influence of the sea surface temperature anomalies over North Atlantic and the Maritime Continent on maize yield in Northeast China,"•The severe drought from the jointing to the maturity period has severely affected the maize growth. •The SST anomalies over the North Atlantic and the Maritime Continent are two precursor factors to summer drought over NEC. •The maize yield series predicted by the prediction model has high covariance with the observed values. 
 Northeastern China (NEC) is the largest grain base in China. Improving understanding of the effect of climate change on grain production over NEC is conducive to providing immediate response strategies for grain production. In this study, the relationships of the maize production with the dry state during the different maize growth stage have been investigated using the year-to-year increment method. Results showed that the severe drought that occurred from the jointing to maturity period have exerted severe effects on the maize growth. Further analysis indicated that the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over North Atlantic and Maritime Continent in later spring are the important factors affecting the summer droughts over NEC. The late spring SST anomaly over North Atlantic can excite the Rossby waves from the western North Atlantic and propagate eastward to NEC. The snow anomaly over western Siberia in late spring and the soil moisture anomaly over NEC in summer are key factors linking the SST anomaly to drought over the NEC. On the other hand, the Maritime Continent SST anomaly in late spring can modulate the activity of the East Asian jet stream via the East Asia-Pacific (EAP) teleconnection, which can provide the favorable conditions for the soil moisture reduction over NEC. Eventually, a predictive model for maize yield over NEC is successfully developed by using the predictive indices of the North Atlantic and the Maritime Continental SST during late spring. Both the cross-validation and independent sample tests show that the calibrated prediction model is robust and exhibits high skill in predicting maize yield over NEC."

The analysis is based on 21 d of lidar and aircraft observations. The main objective is an analysis of the sensitivity of ozone pollution to the micrometeorological processes in the urban atmospheric boundary layer and the transport of regional pollution. The paper also discusses to what extent satellite observations can track observed ozone plumes. 
 The variability of ozone vertical profiles in the Paris area is analyzed using 21 d of lidar monitoring of the lower-troposphere ozone vertical profiles and planetary boundary layer (PBL) vertical structure evolution in summer 2022. Characterization of the pollution regional transport is based on daily ozone analysis of the Copernicus Atmospheric Service (CAMS) ensemble model and on backward trajectories. The CAMS simulations of the ozone plume between the surface and 3 km are consistent with the ozone measurements. Comparisons with the tropospheric ozone column retrieved by satellite observations of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) show that IASI observations can capture the day-to-day variability of the 0–3 km ozone column only when the maximum altitude of the ozone plume is higher than 2 km.The lidar ozone vertical structure above the city center is also in good agreement with the PBL growth during the day and with the formation of the residual layer during the night. The analysis of four ozone pollution events shows that the thickness of the PBL during the day and the advection of regional-scale plumes above the PBL can significantly change the ozone concentrations above Paris. Advection of ozone-poor concentrations in the free troposphere during a Saharan dust event is able to mitigate ozone photochemical production. On the other hand, the advection of a pollution plume from continental Europe with high ozone concentrations > 140 µg m−3 maintained high concentrations in the surface layer despite a temperature decrease and cloud cover development."

Burrows,Retrieval of stratospheric aerosol extinction coefficients from sun-normalized Ozone Mapper and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) measurements,"We developed a new algorithm to retrieve vertical distributions of aerosol extinction coefficients in the stratosphere. The algorithm is applied to measurements of scattered solar light from the spaceborne OMPS-LP (Ozone Mapper and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler) instrument. The retrieval results are compared to data from other spaceborne instruments and used to investigate the evolution of the aerosol plume following the eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano in January 2022. 
 A new retrieval approach for obtaining vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction coefficient from measurements of scattered solar light in the limb-viewing geometry made by the Ozone Mapper and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) instrument is presented.In contrast to many other published limb-scatter retrievals, our new algorithm does not employ normalization by a limb measurement at an upper tangent height. Instead, the measured limb radiances are normalized to solar irradiance. The main advantage of this approach is an almost complete elimination of the dependence of the retrieval results on the prior aerosol extinction profile used in the retrieval. This makes the retrieval better suited for the analysis of observation scenes with highly elevated aerosol plumes, such as those that occurred after the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha′apai volcanic eruption in January 2022. The results from the new approach were compared to the vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction coefficients retrieved from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the International Space Station (SAGE III/ISS) and the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS). In general, agreement within 25 % between the different data products was observed in the 18–23 km altitude range, although larger differences were seen after very strong volcanic eruptions and wildfires. In comparison with OSIRIS, larger differences are seen at high southern latitudes (above 60° S). The new data product was used to investigate the evolution of the aerosol plume after the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha′apai volcanic eruption."

The observation-minus-simulation biases were able to monitor the performance of the satellite visible instrument. The biases were corrected based on a first-order approximation method, which promotes the data assimilation of satellite visible reflectance in real-world cases. 
 The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) on board the Fengyun (FY)-4A geostationary satellite has provided high-spatiotemporal-resolution visible reflectance data since 12 March 2018. Data assimilation experiments under the framework of observing system simulation experiments have shown the great potential of these data to improve the forecasting skills of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. To assimilate the AGRI visible reflectance in real-world cases, it is important to evaluate the quality and to quantify the observation errors in these data. In this study, the FY-4A AGRI channel 2 (0.55–0.75 µm) reflectance data (O) were compared with the equivalents (B) derived from the short-term forecasts of the China Meteorological Administration Mesoscale (CMA-MESO) model using the Radiative Transfer for the Television Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV, v12.3). It is shown that the O–B biases could be used to reveal the abrupt change related to the measurement calibration processes. In general, the O–B departure was positively biased in most cases. Potential causes include the deficiencies of the NWP model, the forward-operator errors, and the unresolved aerosol processes. The relative biases of O–B computed from cloud-free and cloudy pixels were used to correct the systematic biases for the corresponding scenarios over land and sea surfaces separately. In general, the method effectively reduced the O–B biases. Moreover, the bias-correction method based on an ensemble forecast is more robust than a deterministic forecast due to the advantages of the former in dealing with uncertainties in cloud simulations. The findings demonstrate that analyzing the O–B biases has a potential to monitor the performance of the  FY-4A AGRI visible instrument and to correct the systematic biases in the observations, which will facilitate the assimilation of these data in conventional data assimilation applications."

The results demonstrate excellent performance in distinguishing clear-sky scenes and reducing errors in cloud cover estimation. It shows significant improvements compared to existing methods. 
 Cloud fraction as a vital component of meteorological satellite products plays an essential role in environmental monitoring, disaster detection, climate analysis and other research areas. Random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms were used in this paper to retrieve the cloud fraction of AGRI (Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager) on board the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite based on its full-disk level-1 radiance observation. Corrections have been made subsequently to the retrieved cloud fraction in areas where solar glint occurs using a correction curve fitted with sunglint angle as weight. The algorithm includes two steps: the cloud detection is conducted firstly for each AGRI field of view to identify whether it is clear sky, partly cloudy or overcast within the observation field. Then, the cloud fraction is retrieved for the scene identified as partly cloudy. The 2B-CLDCLASS-lidar cloud fraction product from the CloudSat and CALIPSO active remote sensing satellite is employed as the truth to assess the accuracy of the retrieval algorithm. Comparison with the operational AGRI level-2 cloud fraction product is also conducted at the same time. The results indicate that both the RF and MLP cloud detection models achieved high accuracy, surpassing that of operational products. However, both algorithms demonstrated weaker discrimination capabilities for partly cloudy conditions compared to clear-sky and overcast situations. Specifically, they tended to misclassify fields of view with low cloud fractions (e.g., cloud fraction = 0.16) as clear sky and those with higher cloud fractions (e.g., cloud fraction = 0.83) as overcast. Between the two models, RF exhibited higher overall accuracy. Both RF and MLP models performed well in cloud fraction retrieval, showing lower mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) compared to operational products. The ME for both RF and MLP cloud fraction retrieval models was close to zero, while RF had slightly lower MAE and RMSE than MLP. During daytime, the high reflectance in sunglint areas led to larger retrieval errors for both RF and MLP algorithms. However, after correction, the retrieval accuracy in these regions improved significantly. At night, the absence of visible light observations from the AGRI instrument resulted in lower classification accuracy compared to daytime, leading to higher cloud fraction retrieval errors during nighttime."

The former simulates mean status over coarse grids and the latter the surrounding atmosphere. To solve this, we proposed the new land-use-based representative (LUBR) operator that considers intra-grid variance. The LUBR operator is validated to provide insights that align with satellite measurements. The results highlight the importance of considering fine-scale urban–rural differences when comparing models and observation. 
 Measurements collected from ground monitoring stations have gained popularity as a valuable data source for evaluating numerical models and correcting model errors through data assimilation. The penalty quantified by simulation minus observations drives both model evaluation and assimilation. However, the penal forces are challenged by the existence of a spatial-scale disparity between model simulations and observations. Chemical transport models (CTMs) divide the atmosphere into grid cells, providing a structured way to simulate atmospheric processes. However, their spatial resolution often does not match the limited coverage of in situ measurements, especially for short-lived air pollutants. Within a broad grid cell, air pollutant concentrations can exhibit significant heterogeneity due to their rapid generation and dissipation. Ground observations with traditional methods (including “nearest search” and “grid mean”) are less representative when compared to model simulations. This study develops a new land-use-based representative (LUBR) observational operator to generate spatially representative gridded observations for model evaluation. It incorporates high-resolution urban–rural land use data to address intra-grid variability. The LUBR operator has been validated to consistently provide insights that align with satellite Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurements. It is an effective solution to accurately quantify these spatial-scale mismatches and further resolve them via assimilation. Model evaluations with 2015–2017 NO2 measurements in the study area demonstrate that biases and errors differed substantially when the LUBR and other operators were used, respectively. The results highlight the importance of considering fine-scale urban–rural differences when comparing models and observations, especially for short-lived pollutants like NO2."

While tires are essential to automobile function, the wear of tires as a source of particulate air pollution is still poorly understood. The variety of reported emissions found in the secondary literature motivated us to summarize all known mass-based tire wear emission factors for light-duty vehicles in primary research. When excluding road wear and resuspension, mean emissions of 1.1 mg/km/vehicle (median 0.2 mg/km/vehicle) were found for tire wear PM10 and mean emissions of 2.7 mg/km/vehicle (median 1.1 mg/km/vehicle) when including studies with resuspended tire wear. Notably, these factors are substantially lower than broadly cited and accepted factors in the secondary literature with mean emissions of 6.5 mg/km/vehicle (median 6.1 mg/km/vehicle). As revealed by our analysis, secondary literature reports emission factors systematically higher than those of the primary sources on which they are based. This divergence is due to misunderstandings and misquotations that have been prevalent since the year 1995. Currently accepted mass-based emission factors for directly emitted airborne tire wear particles need revision, including those from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the European Environment Agency."

Air quality forecasting tools are needed to assess the spatiotemporal variability of air pollutants and evaluate the impact of potential mitigation measures. Gridded concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone are typically derived from first principle models called Chemical Transport Models (CTMs). Widespread application of CTMs, particularly for regulatory purposes, requires an understanding of model performance in comparison with observation data. A landscape approach that systematically reviews CTM model predictions and proposes benchmarks for assessing model performance can offer a way forward to build confidence in CTM-backed forecasting tools. Following similar efforts in the United States and China, we systematically shortlisted and examined model performance outcomes for 46 CTM studies reporting PM2.5 and ozone predictions in India between 2008 and 2023. The reported statistical metrics for each pollutant (normalized mean bias (NMB), normalized mean error (NME), coefficient of correlation (r), and index of agreement (IOA) were rank ordered to identify two types of benchmarks: “goals” (highest achievable model accuracy based on top one-third performing studies) and “criteria” (typical model accuracy based on the top two-third performing studies). The identified goal performance for PM2.5 was 17% (NMB), 34% (NME), and 0.67 (r), and ozone was 14% (NMB), 43% (NME), and 0.89 (r). These benchmarks are less restrictive than those reported for the United States and China. This highlights the need for the CTM community to coalesce around a common set of practices in evaluating CTMs. Additionally, complementary efforts in developing representative emissions inventories and including air pollution data from the expanding observational networks are required to update such benchmarks periodically. This study seeks to advance the capabilities of CTMs as a cornerstone of air quality forecasting tools and augment air quality management frameworks in India."

Dedoussi,Sensitivities of Ozone and Radiative Forcing to Supersonic Aircraft Emissions Across Two Flight Corridors,"Civil supersonic aviation may return in the near future. Their emissions have been found to lead to changes in the composition of the stratosphere, affecting the ozone layer and climate. To keep up with the rapid developments in supersonic aircraft technology and alternative fuels there is an increasing need for the development of surrogate modeling methods, which requires knowledge of the sensitivities to these emissions. We present a parametric study which evaluates the first‐ and second‐order sensitivities of the ozone column and radiative forcing (RF) to supersonic emissions across two flight corridors and three altitudes. For a given increase in global fuel burn, we find that the increase in emission of NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$ is the main driver of both the changes in the global ozone column and RF, the latter of which is linked through changes in the ozone distribution. Followed by the increase in the emission of SOx ${\text{SO}}_{x}$, which leads to O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ loss and has a cooling effect. The ozone column and climate are least sensitive to increases in H2O ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ emissions. We also show that interactions between NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$, SOx ${\text{SO}}_{x}$, and H2O ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ emissions lead to non‐linear behavior in the atmospheric response. The effect of these interactions can lead to < ${< } $5% differences in the ozone column impacts and up to 7.3% increases in RF. Our results demonstrate that the majority of second‐order sensitivities may be neglected in surrogate models for small errors, which could greatly simplify their development. Our results also indicate that reductions in flight altitude and fleetwide NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$ emissions may effectively reduce the environmental footprint of supersonic aviation emissions."

However, limited knowledge exists concerning the impacts of different SPP error type on hydrological modeling skill and their sensitivity across different climate zones. In this study, forcing data sets from 10 SPPs were collected to drive hydrological models during the period 2001–2018 for 366 catchments across China. Here, we analyze the impact of the SPP errors associated with different precipitation intensities (light, moderate, and heavy) and different precipitation signatures (magnitude, variance, and occurrence) on the performance of hydrological simulations, and rank the sensitivities of SPPs errors for four major Köppen‐Geiger climate zones. The results show that heavy precipitation in SPPs is generally associated with higher errors than light and moderate precipitation when compared to gauge‐based precipitation observations, but hydrological model skill is more sensitive to errors from moderate precipitation than from heavy precipitation. The probability of moderate precipitation detection was identified as the most sensitive metric in determining hydrological model performance, with sensitivities of 0.58, 0.39, 0.59, and 0.47 in the temperate, boreal, arid, and highland climate zones, respectively. The variance error and magnitude error for heavy precipitation from SPPs were also identified as sensitive factors for hydrological modeling in the temperate and arid climate zones, respectively. These findings are crucial for enhancing the understanding of interactions between SPPs uncertainty and hydrological simulations, leading to improved data accuracy of precipitation forcing and the identification of appropriate SPPs for hydrological simulation in China."

 Accurate national terrestrial net ecosystem exchange estimates are crucial for the global stocktake. Net ecosystem exchange estimates from different inversion models vary greatly at national scale, and the relative impacts of prior fluxes and observations on these inversions remain unclear. Here we estimate the net ecosystem exchange of 51 land regions for the 2017-2019 period, focusing on the 10 largest countries, using prior fluxes from 12 terrestrial biosphere models and XCO2 retrievals from GOSAT and OCO-2 satellites as constraints. The average uncertainty reduction for the 10 countries increases from 37% with GOSAT and 45% with OCO-2 to 50% with combined observations, indicating a trend towards robust estimates. At finer spatial scales, even with combined observations, the uncertainty reduction is only 33%, i.e., the prior flux dominates the estimates. This finding underscores the critical importance of integrating multi-source observations and refining prior fluxes to improve the accuracy of carbon flux estimates. Choice of ecosystem model and input satellite data has a significant impact on modelled carbon dioxide flux and its associated uncertainty for large countries, according to atmospheric inversions using GOSAT and OCO-2 data."

 This study proposed an innovative joint inversion algorithm that synchronized Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) near-infrared (NIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) radiance data for accurate estimates of clear-sky precipitable water vapor (PWV). The algorithm consists of three parts: (1) simplifying the NIR radiative transfer equation by assuming linear reflectance change with wavelength in the 0.85–1.25 μm range, facilitating NIR water vapor absorption channel top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance simulation without explicit reflectance; (2) partial derivatives of NIR-TIR TOA radiance with respect to the background fields were derived by applying the one-term variational theorem to the radiative transfer equation; (3) optimization approach was employed to adjust the background fields, minimizing the discrepancy between simulated and observed NIR-TIR TOA radiances. The refined water vapor profile was integrated to derive PWV. Three years in situ measurements from the 473 GPS sites and 122 sun photometers in North America were utilized for PWV validation. Additionally, the MODIS MYD05 and MYD07 PWV products were validated using the same in situ measurements. Validation results indicated that the root mean square error (RMSE) of PWV retrieval using the NIR-TIR joint inversion algorithm ranged from 2.40 mm in summer to 1.67 mm in winter, and the mean bias and RMSE were − 0.55 mm and 2.08 mm, respectively, outperforming MODIS PWV products. The bias and RMSE were 3.84 mm and 4.86 mm for MYD05, and 0.41 mm and 4.60 mm for MYD07. Overall, the NIR-TIR joint inversion algorithm provides an effective way to generate comprehensive, long-term, high-resolution PWV data records."

 Open biomass burning in Southeast Asia has significant adverse impacts on air quality in the region and in downwind areas. These biomass burning events emit large amounts of light absorbing brown carbon (BrC). Once in the atmosphere, the light absorbing capacity of BrC is reduced by various oxidation processes. However, few modeling studies have been conducted to explicitly examine light absorption and bleaching on the prediction of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In this study, a modified Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model that explicitly tracks the concentrations of light absorbing and non-light absorbing organic aerosol components from different emission sources and the bleaching of BrC due to photooxidation and OH oxidation is applied to widespread open biomass burning events in March 2018 in Southeast Asia. Open biomass burning accounts for as much as 20–40 ppb (30–50%) of the maximum daily average 8-h ozone (MDA8 O3) and 40–120 μg m−3 (60–90%) of the daily average PM2.5 in the emission source regions. Compared to a simulation without BrC light absorption, the predicted MDA8 O3 and PM2.5 are as much as 16 ppb and 16 μg m−3 lower, respectively, than a simulation with light absorption. This confirms that neglecting the UV light absorption of BrC can lead to significant overpredictions of O3 and PM2.5 during the open biomass burning periods, which may lead to an overestimation of the adverse impacts of biomass burning on public health in Southeast Asia. The addition of BrC bleaching results in a 0.5–1% increase in MDA8 O3 and 1–5% increase in PM2.5 compared to the case without BrC bleaching. The results of this study indicate that light absorption by BrC needs to be considered in chemical transport modeling of large open biomass burning events. The BrC bleaching process is relatively slow and neglecting this process does not significantly change the predictions of MDA8 O3 and PM2.5 during open biomass burning."

 Numerous studies have linked air pollution to asthma. However, limited information exists on the effect of ambient ozone (O3), or its interactions with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) or temperature on peak expiratory flow (PEF) of in asthmatic adults. We conducted a longitudinal study including 99 adult asthma patients and documenting 7153 person-days PEF records. Utilizing linear mixed-effect and distributed non-linear models, we investigated the associations between ambient O3 exposures over lag0-14 days with morning and evening PEF, as well as diurnal PEF variability. Findings revealed significant associations between ambient O3 exposure with reduced morning and evening PEF, with varied associations for exposures across different lag days. Specifically, the most pronounced association with morning PEF was found for exposure at lag4, with a change of −0.211 (95%CI: −0.360, −0.062) L/min per 10 μg/m3 increase; for evening PEF, the strongest association was observed for exposure at lag0, with a change of −0.379 (95%CI: −0.721, −0.037) L/min per 10 μg/m3 increase. However, no significant association between O3 and diurnal PEF variability was found. Furthermore, we observed significant interactions between O3 and PM2.5 exposures from lag6 to lag9 on morning and evening PEF, and significant interactions between O3 and temperature from lag1 to lag11 on morning PEF and from lag0 to lag11 on evening PEF. Stronger associations between O3 and PEF were observed in males, those aged over 40 years, overweight individuals, smokers and those with non-allergic asthma.

 The instantaneous radiative effects of cores of deep convective clouds (CDCCs) linked to well-organised long-lived convective system over the tropics is estimated for the first time using Megha-Tropiques (MT) during 2012‐–2018. Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d'Humidité Intertropicale par Radiométrie (SAPHIR) and Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) onboard MT provides collocated and concurrent observations of CDCCs and associated fluxes on top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA), respectively. The vertical extent of CDCCs is estimated using collocated and concurrent CloudSat and SAPHIR observations. The CDCCs have a vertical extent above 10 km and their frequency of occurrence peaks between 13 and 16 km. CDCCs exert significant longwave radiative effect over the tropical Africa, northwest Pacific Ocean and northern Bay of Bengal during June–August with values ranging between 160 Wm−2 and 180 Wm−2. Over the convective core regions, the magnitude of day time (08–17 Local time) shortwave radiative effect of CDCCs (SWREC) ranges from −250 Wm−2 to −650 Wm−2 with peak values over northern Bay of Bengal and west Pacific Ocean during June to August. The SWREC aligns with both the incoming solar radiation and the occurrence frequency of CDCCs (OFCs), while the diurnal cycle of LWREC follows the OFCs, with a more pronounced variation over land. A diurnal amplitude of 30–40 Wm−2 is observed in LWREC over the ocean, ∼60 Wm−2 over land.

 This study investigates the formation and dynamics of the Summer Shamal Wind (SSW) and its associated dust storms over the Middle East. A regional climate model, RegCM4, coupled with a dust module, is employed to simulate a severe dust storm event on June 12, 2006. To gain deeper insights, a novel dynamical mechanism is proposed. This mechanism highlights the crucial role of both mechanical and thermal forcing in shaping the regional atmospheric circulation. The vertical heat advection from the Zagros Mountains (ZAG), combined with the mechanical forcing from a shallow incident flow originating from the Turkmenistan anticyclone, triggers upward motion over the ZAG. This synergistic effect leads to the development of a mid-tropospheric anticyclone over the ZAG, which, in turn, induces a westward-propagating Rossby wave. The downward motion and descending air associated with this wave over Mesopotamia establish a terrain-induced local circulation. Consequently, the SSW emerges within a shallow layer at the null-vorticity zone of a coupling-pressure pattern formed by the Arabian anticyclone and the Zagros trough, which is itself a product of the terrain-induced circulation. The study concludes that the intensification and southward movement of the Turkmenistan anticyclone play a pivotal role in the formation of severe SSWs and subsequent dust storms over the Middle East."

This paper represents efforts by the UWG to build a heuristic framework designed to evaluate data products and communicate uncertainty to both scientific and non-scientific end users.

However, the mechanisms driving the interannual variability of these smoke aerosols are not well understood. By analyzing multi-source historical (1980–2020) smoke aerosols and meteorological reanalysis data, we explore the response of springtime smoke aerosol changes over the ICP to the interannual variability of the Indian Ocean (IO) sea-surface temperature (SST). Our findings show a positive correlation between the variability of springtime smoke aerosol loading and the preceding winter Southeast IO (SEIO) SST anomalies. Warmer SEIO SST tends to weaken the trans-equatorial flow (TEF) and the local Hadley circulation. This weakening of the TEF impedes cyclone development in the Bay of Bengal (BOB), thereby reducing southwest water vapor transport. Simultaneously, enhanced westerly winds over the northern BOB are blocked by the northwestern mountains of ICP. These winds converge and rise on the windward slopes, while descending on the leeward side with diminished humidity. Collectively, these dynamics lead to drier and hotter local meteorological conditions that favored fire-induced smoke aerosol emissions. Our findings highlight the role of the SEIO in regulating smoke aerosol variability and provide a scientific basis for developing strategies to manage smoke aerosol emissions over the ICP."

This approach provides a novel data-driven method to analyse the CLF adjustment by assessing the CLF sensitivity to Nd and numerous meteorological factors as well as the dependence of the Nd–CLF sensitivity on the meteorological conditions. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI) have a pronounced influence on the Earth's radiation budget but continue to pose one of the most substantial uncertainties in the climate system. Marine boundary-layer clouds (MBLCs) are particularly important since they cover a large portion of the Earth's surface. One of the biggest challenges in quantifying ACI from observations lies in isolating adjustments of cloud fraction (CLF) to aerosol perturbations from the covariability and influence of the local meteorological conditions. In this study, this isolation is attempted using 9 years (2011–2019) of near-global daily satellite cloud products in combination with reanalysis data of meteorological parameters. With cloud-droplet number concentration (Nd) as a proxy for aerosol, MBLC CLF is predicted by region-specific gradient boosting machine learning (ML) models. By means of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) regression values, CLF sensitivity to Nd and meteorological factors as well as meteorological influences on the Nd–CLF sensitivity are quantified. The regional ML models are able to capture, on average, 45 % of the CLF variability. Based on our statistical approach, global patterns of CLF sensitivity suggest that CLF is positively associated with Nd, particularly in the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition regions and the Southern Hemispheric midlatitudes. However, Nd retrieval bias may contribute to non-causality in these positive sensitivities, and hence they should be considered upper-bound estimates. CLF sensitivity to estimated inversion strength (EIS) is ubiquitously positive and strongest in tropical and subtropical regions topped by stratocumulus and within the midlatitudes. Globally, increased sea-surface temperature (SST) reduces CLF, particularly in stratocumulus regions. The spatial patterns of CLF sensitivity to horizontal wind components in the free troposphere may point to the impact of synoptic-scale weather systems and vertical wind shear on MBLCs. The Nd–CLF relationship is found to depend more on the selected thermodynamical variables than dynamical variables and in particular on EIS and SST. In the midlatitudes, a stronger inversion is found to amplify the Nd–CLF relationship, while this is not observed in the stratocumulus regions. In the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition regions, the Nd–CLF sensitivity is found to be amplified by higher SSTs, potentially pointing to Nd more frequently delaying this transition in these conditions. The expected climatic changes in EIS and SST may thus influence future forcings from the CLF adjustment. The novel data-driven framework, whose limitations are also discussed, produces a quantification of the response of MBLC CLF to aerosols, taking into account the covariations with meteorology."

Worden;Qindan Zhu,Opinion: Beyond global means – novel space-based approaches to indirectly constrain the concentrations of and trends and variations in the tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH),"Trace gases emitted to or formed within the atmosphere may be chemically or physically removed from the atmosphere. One trace gas, the hydroxyl radical (OH), is responsible for initiating the chemical removal of many trace gases, including some greenhouse gases. Despite its importance, scientists have not been able to adequately measure OH. In this opinion piece, we discuss promising new methods to indirectly constrain OH using satellite data of trace gases that control the abundance of OH. 
 The hydroxyl radical (OH) plays a central role in tropospheric chemistry, as well as influencing the lifetimes of some greenhouse gases. Because of limitations in our ability to observe OH, we have historically relied on indirect methods to constrain its concentrations, trends, and variations but only as annual global or annual semi-hemispheric averages. Recent methods demonstrated the feasibility of indirectly constraining tropospheric OH on finer spatio-temporal scales using satellite observations as proxies for the photochemical drivers of OH (e.g., nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, isoprene, water vapor, ozone). We found that there are currently reasonable satellite proxies to constrain up to about 75 % of the global sources of tropospheric OH and up to about 50 % of the global sinks. With additional research and investment in observing various volatile organic compounds, there is potential to constrain an additional 10 % of the global sources and 30 % of the global sinks. We propose steps forward for the development of a comprehensive space-based observing strategy, which will improve our ability to indirectly constrain OH on much finer spatio-temporal scales than previously achieved. We discuss the strengths and limitations of such an observing strategy and potential improvements to current satellite instrument observing capabilities that would enable better constraint of OH. Suborbital observations (i.e., data collected from non-satellite platforms such as aircraft, balloons, and buildings) are required to collect information difficult to obtain from space and for validation of satellite-based OH estimates; therefore, they should be an integral part of a comprehensive observing strategy."

 The primary source of measurement error from  widely used particulate matter (PM) PurpleAir sensors is ambient relative humidity (RH). Recently, the US EPA developed a national correction model for PM2.5 concentrations measured by PurpleAir sensors (Barkjohn model). However, their study included few sites in the southeastern US, the most humid region of the country. To provide high-quality spatial and temporal data and inform community exposure risks in this area, our study developed and evaluated PurpleAir correction models for use in the warm–humid climate zones of the US. We used hourly PurpleAir data and hourly reference-grade PM2.5 data from the EPA Air Quality System database from January 2021 to August 2023. Compared with the Barkjohn model, we found improved performance metrics, with error metrics decreasing by 16 %–23 % when applying a multilinear regression model with RH and temperature as predictive variables. We also tested a novel semi-supervised clustering method and found that a nonlinear effect between PM2.5 and RH emerges around  RH of 50 %, with slightly greater accuracy. Therefore, our results suggested that a clustering approach might be more accurate in high humidity conditions to capture the nonlinearity associated with PM particle hygroscopic growth."

However, such a retrofitting approach may also pose potential environmental and health risks, even aggravating regional disparities. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the associated risks of Biomass and Coal Cofiring Retrofit (BCCR) in China. We find that air pollutants such as SO2, PM2.5, and NOx will increase by an average of 27.9, 38.04, and 42.79% respectively compared to the scenario with no BCCR. The national-wide PM2.5 concentration-related premature mortalities in scenarios with BCCR are projected to increase by 23.53% on average in 2030. Moreover, the Highest-20% of provinces with higher health risks (also health vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children concentrated area) are 19 times greater than that in the Lowest-20% group. Results suggest that implementing a Targeted Pollution Control strategy for areas with higher health risks would be an economical and effective way to reduce the total pollutants emissions and mitigate the regional disparities in health risks. Our research proposes stringent pollution control measures on biomass and coal cofiring retrofit in advance in regions with the utmost necessity to facilitate a fair transition toward clean energy."

Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) can form during the atmospheric degradation of precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), N-alkylated perfluoroalkane sulfonamides (FASAs), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Since PFCAs and PFSAs will readily undergo wet deposition, snow and ice cores are useful for studying PFAS in the Arctic atmosphere. In this study, 36 PFAS were detected in surface snow around the Arctic island of Spitsbergen during January–August 2019 (i.e., 24 h darkness to 24 h daylight), indicating widespread and chemically diverse contamination, including at remote high elevation sites. Local sources meant some PFAS had concentrations in snow up to 54 times higher in Longyearbyen, compared to remote locations. At a remote high elevation ice cap, where PFAS input was from long-range atmospheric processes, the median deposition fluxes of C2–C11 PFCAs, PFOS and HFPO–DA (GenX) were 7.6–71 times higher during 24 h daylight. These PFAS all positively correlated with solar flux. Together this suggests seasonal light is important to enable photochemistry for their atmospheric formation and subsequent deposition in the Arctic. This study provides the first evidence for the possible atmospheric formation of PFOS and GenX from precursors."

The landscape of satellite instruments with some methane point-source quantification capabilities is growing. Combining information across available sensor platforms could be pivotal for understanding trends and uncertainties in source-level emissions. However, to effectively combine information across sensors of varying performance levels, the probability of detection (POD) for all instruments must be well characterized, which is time-consuming and costly, especially for satellites. In August 2023, we timed methane-sensing aerial surveys from the Global Airborne Observatory (GAO) to overlap with observations from the NASA Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT). We show how these coincident observations can be used to determine and verify the detection limits of EMIT and to develop and test a multisensor persistence framework. Under favorable conditions, the 90% POD at 3  for EMIT is 1060. We further derive a Bayesian model to infer probabilistically whether nondetected emissions were truly off, and we validate and show how this model can be used to assess the intermittency of emissions with GAO and EMIT. Time-averaged emission rates from persistent sources can be underestimated if POD is not characterized and if differences in POD across multisensor frameworks are not properly accounted for."

This interaction results in ionosphere structuring and variability that pose major challenges for accurate ionosphere prediction for global navigation satellite system (GNSS) related applications and space weather research. The ionospheric structuring and variability are often probed using the total electron content (TEC) and its relative perturbations (dTEC). Among dTEC variations observed at high latitudes, a unique modulation pattern has been linked to magnetospheric ultra‐low‐frequency (ULF) waves, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here using magnetically conjugate observations from the THEMIS spacecraft and a ground‐based GPS receiver at Fairbanks, Alaska, we provide direct evidence that these dTEC modulations are driven by magnetospheric electron precipitation induced by ULF‐modulated whistler‐mode waves. We observed peak‐to‐peak dTEC amplitudes reaching ∼ ${\sim} $ 0.5 TECU (1 TECU is equal to 106 ${10}^{6}$ electrons/m2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{2}$) with modulations spanning scales of ∼ ${\sim} $ 5–100 km. The cross‐correlation between our modeled and observed dTEC reached ∼ ${\sim} $ 0.8 during the conjugacy period but decreased outside of it. The spectra of whistler‐mode waves and dTEC also matched closely at ULF frequencies during the conjugacy period but diverged outside of it. Our findings elucidate the high‐latitude dTEC generation from magnetospheric wave‐induced precipitation, addressing a significant gap in current physics‐based dTEC modeling. Theses results thus improve ionospheric dTEC prediction and enhance our understanding of magnetosphere‐ionosphere coupling via ULF waves."

In addition to the well‐recognized temporal intermittency of solar energy supply, the local energy demand to cope with extreme weathers can further stress the energy grid; both the supply and demand can be greatly influenced by future climate change. Here, we redefine solar drought events by considering supply demand imbalance in solar power. Observation and multi‐model simulations reveal an anthropogenic exacerbation of global solar drought frequency in the past three decades. Moreover, compared to the pathway SSP2‐4.5, the carbon neutrality pathway SSP1‐2.6 can mitigate the increasing frequency and severity of solar droughts by 60% and 63% in the 2090s, respectively.

In this study, we investigate the influence of wildfires on atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) variability through a comparative analysis of observations from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Our focus is on the North American domain, aiming to understand the differences among these products. In general, all instruments show excellent agreement under typical atmospheric CO conditions. However, notable discrepancies were observed in the CO data from the three sensors, particularly in regions with elevated CO total column (TC) values. IASI and TROPOMI consistently showed higher CO values over the western U.S. compared to MOPITT. During the fire episodes, we found that the IASI retrievals suggested higher CO abundances near the surface than the MOPITT thermal infrared retrievals that are probably the result of the differences in the covariance matrices used in IASI and MOPITT retrievals. We also found that the high IASI and TROPOMI CO observations over the western U.S. coincided with high values of the TROPOMI aerosol index (AI), suggesting the presence of absorbing aerosols. The analysis exhibited better agreement between TROPOMI and MOPITT CO TC when the AI values were low. Our results suggest that appropriate quality filtering should be employed when analyzing pollution events with these data. In particular, utilizing the AI for quality filtering may be useful when analyzing extreme pollution events with these satellite products."

Accurate quantification of BB emissions is vital for assessing its environmental and climate impacts. However, there are still large uncertainties in current BB emission inventories due to poorly characterized emission rates under different combustion states. The fixed emission factor (EF) instead of varying EF associated with different combustion efficiencies may be the reason for the bias. Here, based on satellite‐retrieved carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), the modified combustion efficiency (MCE) is derived for fire‐prone regions in Africa. The monthly and inter‐annual variability of MCE shows a good correlation with meteorological variables such as relative humidity. Therefore, variable EF was established based on its statistical relationship with MCE for different fire‐emitted species. Application of such MCE‐dependent EF in the global climate‐chemistry model can greatly improve the performance of wildfire smoke pollution during the fire season, indicated by an increase of 31% in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and a 50% reduction in normalized mean bias compared with AOD observations. The study elucidates the critical role of meteorology in BB emission estimates and highlights the importance of implementing a dynamic fire emission inventory in response to meteorological conditions."

 The SouthEastern Aerosol Research CHaracterization (SEARCH) program examined air quality at 6 sites across the southeastern United States. The Jefferson Street site in Atlanta operated from 1998 to 2016 with the collection and chemical characterization of PM2.5 that provide data suitable for source identification and apportionment with a sufficiently long time series to permit effective trend analyses. Although there have been analyses of parts of these data, there is no prior comprehensive analysis relating the changes in source-specific PM2.5 with policy implementations and economic drivers. The major sources were secondary sulfate, traffic sources (spark- and compression-ignition vehicles), and secondary nitrate. Several local industrial sources were identified primarily assigned as metal working, but likely including a nearby bus maintenance garage. A combined biomass burning and pyrolyzed organic carbon factor was resolved that reflected the extensive prescribed burning that occurred in the southeastern United States to control larger wildfires and that increased in recent years. The major trends were reductions in concentrations of sulfate and nitrate likely as a result of policies to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants and mobile sources. Gasoline vehicle contributions uniformly declined, but there was a period of increase diesel concentrations in the middle of the study period for which the cause is unknown."

 The urgency of the global climate crisis necessitates advanced monitoring of greenhouse gases, with an emphasis on capturing their spatial and temporal variability. This study explores techniques to enhance plume detection and concentration measurements using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring at point sources, specifically at an incineration stack. Through preliminary site investigations, our approach employed strategically designed flight paths and an autopilot system to optimize flight operations within the constraints of limited flight time due to battery capacity. We combined a UAV-mounted anemometer with a plume rise model to localize the plume center at a distance of 30 m from the stack center and evaluated its performance by comparing the model-based estimations at different altitudes and angular directions with the observation results. The comparison demonstrated that the results obtained by localizing the plume center using a plume rise model and a UAV-mounted anemometer aligned well with observations based on CO2 concentration analysis. The comparative analysis showed a RMSE of 8.44 m and a MAE of 7.26 m for altitude, and a RMSE of 32.31∘ and a MAE of 25.78∘ for angular direction. Furthermore, we assessed the effectiveness of hovering UAV flights, in which a UAV remains stationary at a fixed point in the air, compared to non-hovering flights in capturing pollutant concentration. While both methods performed similarly in detecting the plume center, non-hovering flights underestimated the CO2 concentration due to insufficient time for measurement despite a sensor response time of less than three seconds. Overall, our proposed hybrid monitoring strategy integrates non-hovering and hovering flights, enhancing both plume detection efficiency and concentration measurement accuracy at point sources."

Spatiotemporal variations of open straw burning in Northeast China are revealed. Open straw burning in Northeast China emitted a total of 218 Tg of CO2-eq during 2001–2020. The policy of banning straw burning effectively reduced greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Open straw burning has been widely recognized as a significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs), posing critical risks to atmospheric integrity and potentially exacerbating global warming. In this study, we proposed a novel method that integrates crop cycle information into extraction and classification of fire spots from open straw burning in Northeast China from 2001 to 2020. By synergizing the extracted fire spots with the modified fire radiative power (FRP) algorithm, we developed high-spatial-resolution emission inventories of GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Results showed that the northern Sanjiang Plain, eastern Songnen Plain, and eastern Liao River plain were areas with high intensity of open straw burning. The number of fire spots was evaluated during 2013–2017, accounting for 58.2 % of the total fire spots observed during 2001–2020. The prevalent season for open straw burning shifted from autumn (pre-2016) to spring (post-2016), accompanied by a more dispersed pattern in burning dates. The 2-decade cumulative emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O were quantified at 198 Tg, 557 Gg, and 15.7 Gg, respectively, amounting to 218 Tg of CO2-eq (equivalent). Significant correlations were identified between GHG emissions and both straw yield and straw utilization (p<0.01). The enforcement of straw-burning bans since 2018 has played a pivotal role in curbing open straw burning and has reduced fire spots by 51.7 % on an annual basis compared to 2013–2017. The novel method proposed in this study considerably enhanced the accuracy in characterizing spatiotemporal distributions of fire spots from open straw burning and quantifying associated pollutant emissions."

We observed a significant daytime SOA formation through gas–particle partitioning when the site was affected by urban plumes. A box model simulation indicated that urban pollutants (nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds) could enhance the oxidizing capacity, while the elevated volatile organic compounds were mainly responsible for promoting daytime SOA formation. 
 Anthropogenic emissions from city clusters can significantly enhance secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in the downwind regions, while the mechanism is poorly understood. To investigate the effect of pollutants within urban plumes on organic aerosol (OA) evolution, a field campaign was conducted at a downwind site of the Pearl River Delta region of China in the fall of 2019. A time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer coupled with the Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosols (FIGAERO–CIMS) was used to probe the gas- and particle-phase molecular composition and thermograms of organic compounds. For air masses influenced by urban pollution, strong daytime SOA formation through gas–particle partitioning was observed, resulting in higher OA volatility. The obvious SOA enhancement was mainly attributed to the gas–particle partitioning of high-volatility (semi-volatile organic compounds + intermediate volatility organic compounds + volatile organic compounds, C∗>0.3 µg m−3) organic vapors. Using the equilibrium equation could underestimate the contribution of high-volatility organic vapors, since the volatility of these species in the particle phase was lower than that in the gas phase. We speculated that the elevated NOx concentration could suppress the formation of highly oxidized products, resulting in a smooth increase of low-volatility (extremely low volatility organic compounds + low volatility organic compounds, C∗≤0.3 µg m−3) organic vapors. Evidence has shown that urban pollutants (NOx and VOCs) could enhance the oxidizing capacity, while the elevated VOCs were mainly responsible for promoting daytime SOA formation by increasing the RO2 production rate. Our results highlight the important role of urban anthropogenic pollutants in SOA control in the suburban region."
10.5194/acp-24-13081-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了自2006年以来，对平流层臭氧恢复日期预估的延迟问题。其核心在于评估臭氧层恢复到1980年水平所需的时间，并分析导致预测延迟的因素。文中提到的“equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC)”以及各种消耗臭氧物质（ODS）的排放量、大气寿命等，都与大气成分分析密切相关。虽然文章没有直接提及具体的卫星或传感器类型，但要进行臭氧层和相关物质的监测，必然依赖于大气环境遥感技术，例如卫星观测和地面空气质量监测。研究结果对改进臭氧层恢复预测，以及评估《蒙特利尔议定书》的有效性具有重要意义，这与大气环境遥感技术的应用方向高度一致。,"['stratospheric ozone', 'halogen', 'ozone-depleting substances', 'atmospheric composition', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'Montreal Protocol']",Megan J. Lickley;John S. Daniel;Laura A. McBride;Ross J. Salawitch;Guus J. M. Velders,The return to 1980 stratospheric halogen levels: a moving target in ozone assessments from 2006 to 2022,"The expected ozone recovery date was delayed by 17 years between the 2006 and 2022 international scientific assessments of ozone depletion. We quantify the primary drivers of this delay. Changes in the metric used to estimate ozone recovery explain ca. 5 years of this delay. Of the remaining 12 years, changes in estimated banks, atmospheric lifetimes, and emission projections explain 4, 3.5, and 3 years of this delay, respectively. 
 The international scientific assessment of ozone depletion is prepared every 4 years to support decisions made by the parties to the Montreal Protocol. In each assessment an outlook of ozone recovery time is provided. The year when equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) returns to the level found in 1980 is an important metric for the recovery of the ozone layer. Over the past five assessments, the expected date for the return of EESC to the 1980 level, for mid-latitudes, was delayed, from the year 2049 in the 2006 assessment to 2066 in the 2022 assessment, which represents a delay of 17 years over a 16-year assessment period. Here, we quantify the primary drivers that have delayed the expected EESC recovery date between each of these assessments. We find that by using identical EESC formulations, the delay between the 2006 and 2022 assessments' expected return of EESC to 1980 levels is shortened to 12.6 years. Of this delay, bank calculation methods account for ∼ 4 years, changes in the assumed atmospheric lifetime for certain ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) account for ∼ 3.5 years, an underestimate of the emission of carbon tetrachloride accounts for ∼ 3 years, and updated historical mole fraction estimates of ODSs account for ∼ 1 year. Since some of the underlying causes of these delays are amenable to future controls (e.g., capture of ODSs from banks and limitations on future feedstock emissions), it is important to understand the reasons for the delays in the expected recovery date of stratospheric halogens."

Horner;Eloise A. Marais;Nana Wei;Robert G. Ryan;Viral Shah,Vertical profiles of global tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) obtained by cloud slicing the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI),"Nitrogen oxides (NOx ≡ NO + NO2) affect tropospheric ozone and the hydroxyl radical, influencing climate and atmospheric oxidation. To address the lack of routine observations of NOx, we cloud slice satellite observations of NO2 to derive a new dataset of global vertical profiles of NO2. We evaluate our data against in situ aircraft observations and use these data to critique the contemporary understanding of tropospheric NOx, as simulated by the GEOS-Chem model. 
 Routine observations of the vertical distribution of tropospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx ≡ NO + NO2) are severely lacking, despite the large influence of NOx on climate, air quality, and atmospheric oxidants. Here, we derive vertical profiles of global seasonal mean tropospheric NO2 by applying the cloud-slicing method to TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) columns of NO2 retrieved above optically thick clouds. The resultant NO2 is provided at a horizontal resolution of 1° × 1° for multiple years (June 2018 to May 2022), covering five layers of the troposphere: two layers in the upper troposphere (180–320 hPa and 320–450 hPa), two layers in the middle troposphere (450–600 hPa and 600–800 hPa), and the marine boundary layer (800 hPa to the Earth's surface). NO2 in the terrestrial boundary layer is obtained as the difference between TROPOMI tropospheric columns and the integrated column of cloud-sliced NO2 in all layers above the boundary layer. Cloud-sliced NO2 typically ranges from 20–60 pptv throughout the free troposphere, and spatial coverage ranges from > 60 % in the mid-troposphere to < 20 % in the upper troposphere and boundary layer. When both datasets are abundant and sampling coverage is commensurate, our product is similar (within 10–15 pptv) to NO2 data from NASA DC-8 aircraft campaigns. However, such instances are rare. We use cloud-sliced NO2 to critique current knowledge of the vertical distribution of global NO2, as simulated by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, which has been updated to include peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN) and aerosol nitrate photolysis, liberating NO2 in the lower troposphere and mid-troposphere for aerosol nitrate photolysis and in the upper troposphere for PPN. Multiyear GEOS-Chem and cloud-sliced means are compared to mitigate the influence of interannual variability. We find that for cloud-sliced NO2, interannual variability is ∼ 10 pptv over remote areas and ∼ 25 pptv over areas influenced by lightning and surface sources. The model consistently underestimates NO2 across the remote marine troposphere by ∼ 15 pptv. At the northern midlatitudes, GEOS-Chem overestimates mid-tropospheric NO2 by 20–50 pptv as NOx production per lightning flash is parameterised to be almost double that of the rest of the world. There is a critical need for in situ NO2 measurements in the tropical terrestrial troposphere to evaluate cloud-sliced NO2 there. The model and cloud-sliced NO2 discrepancies identified here need to be investigated further to ensure confident use of models to understand and interpret factors affecting the global distribution of tropospheric NOx, ozone, and other oxidants."

It aims to promote a comprehensive understanding of the cloud dynamics and cloud-climate feedback. Closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) clouds occur more frequently at night, while suppressed cumulus exhibit remarkable decrease. Solid stratus and MCC cloud types show clear seasonal variations. 
 Marine low clouds tend to organize into larger mesoscale patterns with distinct morphological appearances over the ocean, referred to as mesoscale morphology. While prior studies have mainly examined the fundamental characteristics and shortwave radiative effects of these mesoscale morphologies, their behaviour in the nighttime marine boundary layer (MBL) remains underexplored due to limited observations. To address this, we created a global classification dataset of daytime and nighttime mesoscale morphologies of marine low clouds using a deep residual network model and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) infrared radiance data, with machine-learning-retrieved all-day cloud optical thickness aiding in model training. We analysed day-night contrasts in climatology, seasonal cycles, and cloud properties of different cloud morphology types in this study. Results show that relative frequency of occurrence (RFO) of closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) significantly increase at night, while that of suppressed cumulus (Cu) shows a remarkable decrease. Disorganized MCC and clustered Cu display a slight frequency increase during night. In addition, solid stratus and three MCC types exhibit distinct seasonal variations, whereas two cumuliform types show no clear seasonal cycle. Our dataset extends the study of mesoscale cloud morphologies from daytime to nighttime and 1° × 1° resolution makes it better match with other climate datasets. It will provide a vital foundation for further research on the interactions between cloud morphology and climate processes. Our dataset is open-access and available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13990646 (Wu et al., 2024)."

We detail the various numerical properties of the advection order method and demonstrate its implementation in a 3D weather prediction model (WRF) for the first time. Particle-based techniques improve the accuracy of aerosol size and composition predictions, which are key for aerosol–cloud and aerosol–radiation interactions. 
 This paper presents the development of a stochastic particle method to simulate advection in regional-scale models with a particle-resolving aerosol representation.  The new method is based on finite-volume discretizations with the flux terms interpreted as probabilities of particle transport between grid cells. We analyze the method in 1D and show that the stochastic particle sampling during transport injects energy at high spatial frequencies, which can be partially compensated for with the choice of a dissipative odd-order finite-volume scheme. We then apply the stochastic third- and fifth-order advection algorithms with monotonic limiters in WRF-PartMC, using idealized and realistic wind fields in 2D and 3D. In all cases we observe the expected convergence rates of the stochastic particle method to the finite-volume solution as the number of computational particles is increased.

This study shows improvements in introduced into the IFS-COMPO simulating the surface concentrations of SIA and the resulting changes in the total wet deposition for Europe, the US and South-East Asia. 
 Secondary Inorganic Aerosol (SIA) constitutes a considerable fraction of total particulate matter exposure, making it an important component of any atmospheric composition and air quality forecasting system. The subsequent loss of SIA to the surface, via both dry and wet deposition, determines the exposure time for humans and the extent of damage imposed on sensitive ecosystems due to increased surface acidity. This study provides a description and evaluation of recent updates to aerosol production, scavenging, and wet deposition processes in the global IFS-COMPO chemical forecasting system, used within the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. The implementation of the EQSAM4Clim simplified thermodynamic module in IFS-COMPO cycle 49R1 alters the phase transfer efficiency of SIA precursor gases (sulphur dioxide, nitric acid, and ammonia), which significantly affects particulate SIA concentrations by modifying the fraction converted into aerosol form. Comparisons with surface observational data from Europe, the U.S., and Southeast Asia during 2018 indicate reductions in the global annual mean bias for both sulphates and nitrates. Updating the IFS-COMPO model to cycle 49R1 increases the burden and lifetime of sulphate and ammonium particles by one-third. Coupling EQSAM4Clim with IFS-COMPO improves the representation of ammonia-ammonium partitioning across regions, while the effect on sulphate is minimal. For nitric acid and nitrates, the phase partitioning is also significantly altered, with lower particulate concentrations leading to an excess of gas-phase nitric acid and an associated improvement in surface nitrate predictions. The impact on total regional wet deposition is generally positive, although sulphates in the U.S. and ammonium particles in Southeast Asia are strongly influenced by precursor emission estimates. Overall, these results provide confidence in the ability of IFS-COMPO cycle 49R1 to deliver accurate global-scale deposition fluxes of sulphur and nitrogen."

Results indicate a positive bias correlated with US anthropogenic emissions during summer in the eastern US and a negative bias correlated with stratospheric ozone during spring. 
 United States (US) background ozone (O3) is the counterfactual O3 that would exist with zero US anthropogenic emissions. Estimates of US background O3 typically come from chemical transport models (CTMs), but different models vary in their estimates of both background and total O3. Here, a measurement–model data fusion approach is used to estimate CTM biases in US anthropogenic O3 and multiple US background O3 sources, including natural emissions, long-range international emissions, short-range international emissions from Canada and Mexico, and stratospheric O3. Spatially and temporally varying bias correction factors adjust each simulated O3 component so that the sum of the adjusted components evaluates better against observations compared to unadjusted estimates. The estimated correction factors suggest a seasonally consistent positive bias in US anthropogenic O3 in the eastern US, with the bias becoming higher with coarser model resolution and with higher simulated total O3, though the bias does not increase much with higher observed O3. Summer average US anthropogenic O3 in the eastern US was estimated to be biased high by 2, 7, and 11 ppb (11 %, 32 %, and 49 %) for one set of simulations at 12, 36, and 108 km resolutions and 1 and 6 ppb (10 % and 37 %) for another set of simulations at 12 and 108 km resolutions. Correlation among different US background O3 components can increase the uncertainty in the estimation of the source-specific adjustment factors. Despite this, results indicate a negative bias in modeled estimates of the impact of stratospheric O3 at the surface, with a western US spring average bias of −3.5 ppb (−25 %) estimated based on a stratospheric O3 tracer. This type of data fusion approach can be extended to include data from multiple models to leverage the strengths of different data sources while reducing uncertainty in the US background ozone estimates."

Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most abundant cells in blood, which are actively involved in multiple hematological diseases, such as blood clot formation and thrombosis. Exploring how PM2.5 with spatiotemporal heterogeneity influences the hematological system by targeting RBCs would help gain insights into the deleterious effects of PM2.5 and provide clues for finding the causative components therein. Herein, the PM2.5 samples collected from 3 urban sites in Beijing (i.e., Chaoyang, Shunyi, and Yanqing districts) during 4 seasons of 2022 were studied for their toxicities to mouse RBCs, and the main contributing components were further explored through chemical analysis and correlation measure. The results showed that exposure to PM2.5 samples decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and increased phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization of RBCs, causing cell morphological deformity. The Pearson correlation analysis showed that the aromaticity of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in PM2.5 samples was positively correlated with PS exposure of RBCs, showing that the lignin-like compounds were the potential contributors. The negative correlation of zeta potentials of PM2.5 samples with PS exposure of RBCs showed the particle-derived bioactivities of this airborne pollutant. The simulative test based on artificial nanomaterials of carbon black (CB) and oxidized CB (OCB) confirmed the crucial role of particulate carbon in PM2.5-induced effects on RBCs, and soot with a certain oxidation degree was, thus, recognized as another contributor, given its ubiquitous existence in PM2.5 samples. This study, for the first time, revealed PM2.5-induced PS exposure of RBCs, and the causative components of DOM and soot were unraveled.

The site is adjacent to a major interstate highway and beyond the urban/suburban core is surrounded by national forests to the north and northeast and by farmland to the west and south. Maximum mixing ratios of formic, acetic, propionic, and pentanoic acid were typically near 10, 3, 0.4, and 0.2 ppbv, respectively. Observed daytime concentrations of these acids were mostly consistent with other studies, but concentrations were persistently the highest at night between 20:00 to 8:00 (local standard time). Such elevated nighttime concentrations are unlike most other reported organic acid measurements. Although there were times when organic acid concentrations were enhanced by mobile source emissions, the organic acid concentrations appear to be mainly controlled by noncombustion surface primary emissions. Source apportionment by positive matrix factorization (PMF) supports the importance of significant noncombustion, nonphotochemical emissions. Two agricultural surface sources were identified and estimated to contribute to greater than half of total observed concentrations of formic and acetic acid. In contrast to the other measured organic acids, but in agreement with all other reported measurements in the literature, pyruvic acid concentrations peaked during the daytime and were largely controlled by photochemistry."

Brem,Emission and Formation of Aircraft Engine Oil Ultrafine Particles,"Civil aviation gas turbine engines emit ultrafine particles (UFPs, diameter < 100 nm). UFPs degrade air quality because they efficiently transport their chemical content, including engine oil, into the body. Yet, little is known about how and when oil containing UFPs are formed. Results here describe the thrust and flight phase-dependent oil emission and reveal the particle size-dependent transfer of vaporized oil to UFPs with molecular level resolution. All six engines studied emitted oil containing UFPs. Lower volatility oil molecules are enriched on particles <30 nm. Further, the particulate oil mass size distribution aligns with the emitted surface area distribution, suggesting oil vapor condensation onto primary particles and the potential for oil nucleation. However, the oil gas-to-particle transfer in hot exhaust is likely incomplete at least 50 m downwind thus limiting current emission studies. The measured engine oil consumption provides an upper-limit oil emission index at idle of 240 mg oil per kg fuel. The emission index at cruise is 110 mg kg–1, which is a factor of 10 greater than black carbon. For any flight >2 h, 95% of oil emission is expected to occur at cruise altitude, highlighting the unknown effects of oil emission in the upper atmosphere."

Smoke plumes from these fires advected across the United States (U.S.) Upper Midwest, producing regional scale surface enhancements of PM2.5 and ozone, as recorded by the U.S. surface monitoring network. These events are notable because they occurred early in the fire season (May 15‐June 30), and they produced the highest regional‐scale surface ozone levels ever recorded across the northern tier of the U.S. during early (May–June) or late (July‐August) summer. Specifically, the Upper Midwest 50th ozone percentile was greater than in any other year since 1995, when the ozone monitoring network had sufficient coverage to assess regional‐scale ozone levels; the 90th percentile was the highest since 2002.

This study incorporates a STLRE scheme in the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) for the FY‐4A/Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI). The total surface downwelling long‐wave radiance (SDLR) over rugged areas at sub‐pixel is composed of the radiance from the overlying atmosphere under plane‐parallel radiation condition and the radiance emitted from surrounding terrains, weighted by the sky view factor (SKV). Based on the homogenous assumption, a STLRE scheme is established through constructing terrain correction factors at AGRI pixel scale. The ExpCTL/ExpTOPO experiments with the CRTM adopting the plane‐parallel scheme/STLRE scheme are conducted to evaluate the simulations of AGRI clear‐sky TB over the rugged areas. Results show that considering the STLRE can significantly reduce the orography dependent simulation biases in the plane‐parallel scheme. The reductions of biases for the AGRI channel 11–13 regionally averaged over the rugged areas are 64.2%, 72.7% and 67.6%, respectively. Stable correction performance is found at different times of the day. Meanwhile, the corrections of SDLR are more obvious in winter than in summer, and in barren condition than in the other land cover types. This is theoretically attributed to the land‐air temperature difference and the land surface emissivity, respectively. This pilot study improves the observation operator for infrared TB data assimilation over complex terrain and exhibits broad promotion and application value."

 In August 2022, unprecedented and long-lasting extreme heatwaves attacked the Northern Hemisphere, with simultaneous record-breaking surface air temperature (SAT) in Eastern Europe (EE), Southern China (SC), and Western North America (WNA). However, the underlying physical mechanisms of these concurrent heatwaves, and the extent to which they are driven by anthropogenic forcing versus internal variability remain unclear. Our analysis using the HadGEM3-A-N216 large ensemble attribution model reveals that anthropogenic forcing is responsible for approximately 50% of the heatwaves in EE and SC, and over 80% in WNA. Furthermore, an internally-generated circumglobal atmospheric wave train is identified as a key circulation factor facilitating these simultaneous heatwaves. Observations and numerical simulations indicate that extreme warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Barents Sea, along with extreme cold SST anomalies in the tropical central Pacific, are critical in the formation and maintenance of this atmospheric teleconnection wave train. Under future high-emission scenarios, the influence of the internally-generated atmospheric teleconnection on concurrent heatwaves may be enhanced, particularly in WNA."

 The penetration of shortwave radiation beneath glacier surfaces has the potential to induce melting leading to the formation of a porous white layer commonly known as weathering crust. Very little is known about its role in the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here we provide unprecedented observational evidence for the weathering crust formation over blue ice areas of ice shelves of the Northern Victoria Land in austral summer 2022–2023, by means of in-situ and remote-sensing observations. Then, we estimated the radiative impact of the weathering crust, demonstrating a predominant negative albedo feedback over blue ice areas (on 93% of the study area), with respect to positive melt-albedo feedback (supraglacial-pond formation). Furthermore, weathering crust occurred after a period of increasing temperature, relative humidity, low wind speed and clear sky conditions. Moreover, we claim that this new process should be included in regional climate modelling of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Weathering crust formation over blue ice areas of ice shelves may lead to negative albedo feedback in Antarctic coasts, according to in-situ and remote-sensing observations."

 Large volumes of meltwater produced on the northern Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) are directly routed into proglacial rivers, forming continuous supraglacial-proglacial catchments. Thereby, estimating proglacial river discharge is crucial for better understanding of northern Greenland hydrology and mass balance. We propose a method for estimating proglacial river discharge solely from space by combining Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), ArcticDEM, and Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data. Firstly, we use the modified normalized difference water index to extract proglacial river water masks from 30 m HLS imagery time series and calculate river effective width (We). Secondly, we derive near-dry riverbed cross-sectional curves from ICESat-2 ATL06 data. Thirdly, we intersect proglacial river water masks with riverbed cross-sectional curves to calculate the mean depth, wetted perimeter, cross-sectional area, and hydraulic radius, and combine ArcticDEM to estimate the channel bed slope. Finally, with these hydraulic geometry estimates, we calculate proglacial discharge and analyze its uncertainty via error propagation. We apply this method to estimate the proglacial discharge (Qs) of the Denmark catchment (area ∼ 3254 km2) in northern Greenland during the 2020–2021 melt seasons and compare Qs with the surface meltwater runoff (Qm) simulated by two regional climate models (RCMs, including MARv3.12 and RACMO2.3p2), and validate the accuracy and spatial transferability of the method with in-situ proglacial discharge (Qin-situ) of the Watson River in southwestern Greenland. The results show that: (1) the satellite-estimated We and Qs exhibit significant seasonal variations, with the average We of 579 ± 371 m for 2020, 505 ± 394 m for 2021, and a maximum of 2040 m, and Qs has the average value of 207.6 ± 134.1 m3/s for 2020, 210.4 ± 243.2 m3/s for 2021, and a maximum of 1509.4 ± 190.3 m3/s; (2) the satellite-estimated Qs is positively correlated with the RCM-simulated Qm (R2 = 0.82 and 0.69 for MAR and RACMO, respectively), indicating that RCMs can reflect the overall seasonal variations of proglacial discharge reasonably well; (3) the RCM-simulated Qm is considerably higher than our satellite-estimated Qs, with the bias, RMSE, and RRMSE for MAR (RACMO) being 116.6 ± 5.9 m3/s (130.3 ± 5.9 m3/s), 174.7 ± 6.7 m3/s (208.9 ± 6.1 m3/s), and 83 ± 4 % (100 ± 4 %), respectively, and (4) our satellite-based method can be successfully applied to the Watson River in southwestern Greenland and the resultant Qs matches well with Qin-situ (RRMSE = 27 %). In conclusion, multi-temporal and multi-source satellite observations facilitate the estimation of proglacial river discharge and provide an approach to directly estimate GrIS ice surface meltwater runoff."

 This study compares two data assimilation (DA) methods, the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) and three-dimensional variational analysis (3DVAR), in the assimilation of high-resolution three-dimensional remote sensing data. Different observation operators are applied to each DA method to reflect its specific characteristics and to provide best analysis for precipitation forecast over complex terrain. Since radial velocity has a linear relationship with wind components, it applies relatively easily to both DA methods. However, reflectivity has a nonlinear relationship with model state variables and LETKF applies direct DA, while 3DVAR uses indirect DA. A detailed analysis of two specific snowfall cases using ICE-POP 2018 observational data reveals significant differences in wind field changes. In 3DVAR, strong convergence on the windward side and the rapid growth of water vapor into hydrometeors during the forecast period lead to an overestimation of precipitation. In contrast, LETKF improves the simulation of airflow over mountains and enhances precipitation accuracy, attributed to the background error covariance matrix and observation operator. For accurate winter precipitation forecasts over complex terrain, high-resolution data and advanced DA techniques like LETKF are necessary, as they greatly improve snowfall prediction accuracy."

Despite profound implications for the Arctic climate system and marine ecosystems, the primary drivers of this process remain debated. One hypothesis suggested that alternating phases of the atmospheric Arctic Dipole may have mitigated recent atlantification. Here, we use high-resolution model simulations to disentangle the main contributors to atlantification in the Arctic basin. We show that the decline in Arctic sea ice was the dominant driver, while wind variability associated with the Arctic Dipole played a minor role, contributing slightly rather than mitigating the process. The positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation also made a relatively small contribution. Although recent changes in atmospheric circulation over the Greenland Sea tended to reduce warm water inflow through the Fram Strait, this cooling effect on the Arctic Atlantic Water layer was outweighed by the warming induced by sea ice decline."

Therefore, the global emissions and climate impact of MeSH remain unexplored. We compiled a database of seawater MeSH concentrations, identified their statistical predictors, and produced monthly fields of global marine MeSH emissions adding to DMS emissions. Implemented into a global chemistry-climate model, MeSH emissions increase the sulfate aerosol burden by 30 to 70% over the Southern Ocean and enhance the aerosol cooling effect while depleting atmospheric oxidants and increasing DMS lifetime and transport.
