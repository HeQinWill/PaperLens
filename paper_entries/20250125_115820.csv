10.1088/1748-9326/ada2ac,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究美国单方面农业减排政策对农业部门温室气体排放和商品市场的影响。它构建了一个经济模型，评估了该政策对国内外市场以及全球温室气体排放的影响，重点关注畜牧业的影响以及不同政策实施策略（例如，是否对出口或进口征税）的差异。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，关系不大。它关注的是经济学和政策分析，而非大气环境的直接观测和数据分析。,[],Marcel Adenauer;Michael K Adjemian;Shawn Arita;Wade Brorsen;Joseph Cooper;Gyuhyeong Goh;Berna Karali;Mindy Lyn Mallory;Wyatt Thompson;Jisang Yu,Impacts of unilateral U.S. carbon policies on agricultural sector greenhouse gas emissions and commodity markets,"This article analyzes the consequences of the United States implementing unilateral policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. The policy representation is based loosely on current and past policy initiatives that have subsidized GHG reductions and considered special treatment for sectors heavily involved in trade. To do so, our first step is to generate new estimates of key parameters, elasticities of demand and supply, that are critical to understanding interactions among agricultural commodities, such as between livestock and crop products, in this area of research and more broadly. We apply these parameters in a widely used economic model that estimates the effects of a unilateral U.S. agricultural GHG policy on both domestic and foreign markets as well as global GHG emissions. Livestock effects dominate, driving most U.S. livestock product consumer prices higher and causing mixed crop and crop product price effects. A unilateral policy increases food costs in the implementing country and, if applied to all supplies, domestic and imported, tends to raise prices elsewhere as well. Alternative implementation strategies, such as not imposing the costs on exports or not imposing the costs on imports, can lead to lower food prices and greater consumption in other countries, as well as have important implications for the overall GHG reductions achieved by the unilateral effort."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada4c1,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是通过跨境可再生能源和核能发电来减少德国天然气使用的可能性。它分析了可再生能源（风能、光伏）和核能在满足电力需求、减少对天然气依赖方面的作用，以及它们对德国能源安全的影响。研究中使用了经济学和能源系统建模的方法，并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,[],Christoph Halser;Dogan Keles;Florentina Paraschiv,Saving gas through cross-border renewable and nuclear electricity generation,"In fossil fuel-driven electricity markets, gas power plants are mostly the price setting technology in peak demand hours. At the same time, gas technology has the role of balancing out the volatility of increasing shares of intermittent renewable generation. This interdependence, coupled with recent fears of supply shortages, raises the question how gas-fired generation can be replaced with carbon-free technologies. Controlling for fundamental supply and demand in the interconnected markets, we quantify the effect of intermittent renewable and nuclear generation in neighboring markets on the use of natural gas for electricity generation in Germany. Findings indicate that cross-border intermittent wind, PV, and nuclear generation significantly reduce the need for German gas. We further show Germany’s dependency on French cross-border nuclear energy to supplement the gas unavailability during the gas crisis period. We argue for larger market coupling and flexible generation alternatives and adaptive demand solutions including cross-border capacities for substituting gas when renewable generation is low across Europe."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada813,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文关注的是甲烷减排的成本效益分析，探讨了大气甲烷去除技术（MR）与生物能源碳捕获与封存技术（BECCS）相比，在气候变化减缓方面的竞争力。研究使用气候-温室气体-能源模型评估了甲烷去除技术的成本和减排潜力阈值，以确定在满足特定气候目标的情况下，甲烷去除技术是否比BECCS更具成本效益。研究结果表明，要完全替代BECCS，甲烷去除技术的减排潜力和单位成本需要达到一定的水平。该研究主要关注的是经济和政策层面，而非大气环境遥感技术。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等关系不大。,[],Yann Gaucher;Katsumasa Tanaka;Daniel J A Johansson;Olivier Boucher;Philippe Ciais,Potential and costs required for methane removal to compete with BECCS as a mitigation option,"Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) causing warming after carbon dioxide, and the emission reductions potentials are known to be limited due to the difficulty of abating agricultural methane. We explore in this study the emerging option of atmospheric methane removal (MR) that could complement carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in mitigation pathways. MR is technologically very challenging and potentially very expensive, so the main question is at which cost per ton of methane removed is MR more cost effective than CDR. To address this question, we use an intertemporal optimization climate-GHG-energy model to evaluate the MR cost and removal potential thresholds that would allow us to meet a given climate target with the same or a lower abatement cost and allowing for equal or higher gross CO2 emissions than if CDR through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage were an option. We also compare the effects of MR and CDR on the cost-effective mitigation pathways achieving four different climate targets. Using the ACC2-GET integrated carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, climate and energy system model, we consider a generic MR technology characterized by a given unit cost and a maximal removal potential. We show that to totally replace bioenergy based CDR with MR, the MR potential should reach at least 180–290 MtCH4 per year, i.e. between 50% and 90% of current anthropogenic methane emissions, with maximum unit cost between 11 000 and 69 000 $/tCH4, depending on the climate target. Finally, we found that replacing CDR by MR reshapes the intergenerational distribution of climate mitigation efforts by delaying further the mitigation burden."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada814,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究的是中国陆地碳汇的年际变化及其在高排放情景下对大气CO2浓度变化的影响。研究使用了九个耦合模式比较计划第六阶段（CMIP6）模型的输出数据，分析了不同排放情景下中国陆地净生态系统生产力（NEP）的年际变化（IAV）。结果表明，高排放情景下，中国陆地NEP的IAV将会增强，尤其是在夏季和亚热带-热带季风气候区。这种增强主要归因于季风气候区温度和降水IAV的加剧，以及生态系统对它们的敏感性增强。虽然研究关注大气CO2浓度变化，但这与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析，并没有直接关系。研究更侧重于气候变化对陆地生态系统碳循环的影响，使用了气候模型数据而非遥感观测数据。,"['CO2', 'atmospheric CO2 variation', 'climate change', 'terrestrial carbon sink', 'satellite observation of vegetation']",Han Wu;Li Zhang;Honglin He;Xiaoli Ren;Mengyu Zhang;Dingjin Chu;Yuanhao Zheng,Enhanced interannual variability of the terrestrial carbon sink in China under high emissions,"Interannual variability (IAV) of terrestrial carbon uptake is a major contributor to the variation of atmospheric CO2. With the influence of the East Asian monsoon, future climate variability would significantly increase in China. However, how these future changes will modulate the IAV of China’s terrestrial carbon sinks remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the IAV of China’s terrestrial net ecosystem productivity (NEPIAV) and investigated the potential impacts of climate change under various scenarios during the 21st century using the outputs from nine Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models. The results reveal that China’s terrestrial NEPIAV would be enhanced under higher emissions scenarios from 2015 to 2100. The standard deviation of national NEPIAV under the SSP585 scenario rises by 12% compared with SSP126. The most prominent contribution to this enhancement in the total NEPIAV comes from a larger NEP IAV in summer (10%), particularly in the subtropical–tropical monsoonal climate zone in China. Moreover, the enhancement is largely attributed to the intensified IAV in temperature and precipitation in the monsoonal climate zones as well as the heightened sensitivity to them, especially in the ecosystems of the subtropical–tropical monsoonal zone. Compared with monsoonal precipitation, IAV of temperature in the subtropical–tropical monsoonal climate zone also plays an important role in NEPIAV under higher emissions scenarios. Our results highlight the crucial influence of future fluctuations in monsoon climate systems on terrestrial carbon sink IAV and the urgency of reducing the uncertainties of Earth system models in predicting both climate in monsoon regions and the responses of carbon cycling processes to temperature."
10.1088/1748-9326/adaa89,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是全球洪水模型中径流输入数据选择对洪水风险评估的影响。研究使用了八个不同的陆面模型或全球水文模型的径流数据作为全球洪水模型的输入，分析了不同径流数据导致的洪水模拟结果差异，并以印度马哈纳迪河流域为例，评估了这种差异对人口的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。研究中使用的模型数据可能包含来自遥感技术的观测数据，但这并非研究的核心内容，其重点在于不同径流输入数据对洪水模拟结果的影响和不确定性分析。,[],Jayesh Parmar;Mohit Prakash Mohanty;Subhankar Karmakar,Need for judicious selection of runoff inputs in a global flood model,"Numerous flood hazard assessment and risk management studies depend on hydrodynamic flood models, which require detailed inputs. However, these models face challenges when assessing flood hazards and risks at national scales due to the unavailability of input data and high computational demands. Recent advancements in global flood models (GFMs) have emerged as promising solutions. These widely adopted GFMs, capable of producing flood characteristics, require runoff input typically derived from land surface models (LSMs) or global hydrological models (GHMs), which are prone to inherit cascading uncertainties. Moreover, the utilization of a single runoff input into a GFM can produce biased and misinterpreted flood hazards due to underestimation or overestimation of GFM outputs. To highlight these implications, the present study examines GFM simulations forced with eight state-of-the-art model runoff datasets, including LSMs, GHMs, and reanalysis observations, uncovering unsafe inter-model flood depth variation (IMDV). Focusing on the flood-prone Mahanadi River Basin (MRB) of India, the study observes that IMDV surpasses the self-help range of humans (0.2 m) for 65% of the MRB region, and exceeds human and vehicle safety thresholds (2 m) for 15% of the region, based on four past flood events from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory. These regions exhibiting high IMDV overlap with densely populated areas, potentially affecting 1.66–3.65 million people. Thus, the injudicious use of runoff in GFM for flood disaster planning can lead to inaccurate flood hazard and risk assessments, significantly affecting populous regions. An alternative approach is recommended, advocating for the use of multiple simulations incorporating diverse runoff datasets. This approach would generate conservative and optimistic flood scenarios, leveraging each model’s strengths. Such comprehensive hazard scenarios would enhance flood management and decision-making for policymakers by addressing the uncertainty and providing possible impacts through risk assessments."

Sensitivity tests indicate that the effectiveness of OAE-induced CO2 uptake is primarily influenced by the amount of alkalinity introduced and local wind-driven mixing, with the former determining the overall uptake and the latter affecting short-term variability. Compared to ocean-sourced OAE (direct ocean release), river-sourced OAE (elevated river alkalinity) is more effective and sustainable. River-sourced OAE has higher CO2 uptake efficiency with reduced spatial and temporal uncertainty and greater overall CO2 uptake. For river-sourced OAE, surface pH increases pronouncedly near the mouths of the Mississippi River. The ideal OAE implementation time includes spring, early summer, fall, and winter. Mid and late-summer implementation is not recommended due to weak mixing, which results in less alkalinity dispersal and greater pH variability. In addition, while the aragonite saturation state generally remains below 6 around the Mississippi River plume, it increases pronouncedly during mid to late summer, risking alkalinity loss due to CaCO3 precipitation and reduced CO2 uptake efficiency near river mouths. Scaling OAE-induced CO2 uptake to the 25 largest rivers in the world indicates that increasing riverine alkalinity concentrations by 10% could remove 23.23 megatons of CO2 annually, meeting 0.37%–0.61% of the 2025–2030 CO2 removal target."
10.1088/1748-9326/adab08,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了厄尔尼诺-南方涛动(ENSO)对东亚地区冬季大气环流的影响，重点关注了早冬和晚冬期间ENSO遥相关的不一致性。研究使用因果推断分析方法，发现西伯利亚积雪水当量在ENSO信号从早冬到晚冬的传递中起到了关键作用，它像一座‘陆桥’，储存ENSO信号，并在晚冬通过‘大气桥’释放。积雪水当量的减少导致地表温度降低，从而引发与ENSO相关的欧亚波列，最终导致晚冬ENSO遥相关与早冬不同。该研究主要关注大气环流和气候变化，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的关系不大。,"['atmospheric circulation', 'snow water equivalent', 'ENSO teleconnections', 'Siberian snow cover', 'East Asia climate']",Xiadong An;Wen Chen;Tianjiao Ma;Lifang Sheng,Inconsistent ENSO teleconnections over East Asia in early and late winter: role of Siberian land-atmosphere coupling,"The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections over East Asia display inconsistency between early and late winter, yet the undering physical mechanisms remain unclear. Employing causal inference analysis, including Liang-Kleeman information flow and PC-MCI causal discovery, our study reveals a stable information flow from ENSO to the upper tropospheric atmospheric circulation (250 hPa) over southern East Asia. Building on this, we explore the reason behind the differences in ENSO teleconnections during early and late winter. Findings indicate that Siberian snow water equivalent acts as a ‘land bridge’, storing ENSO signals from early to late winter, which are then released via an ‘atmospheric bridge’ in late winter. Specifically, reduced snow water equivalent from early to late winter facilitates lower surface temperatures in late winter, serving as a cooling source to initiate an ENSO-related wave train over Eurasia. This leads to an inconsistent ENSO teleconnection in late winter, contrasting with early winter, and vice versa."
10.5194/acp-25-923-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文探讨了农业和食物系统对大气化学和空气质量的影响，特别关注活性氮等化合物的排放及其对人类健康和生态系统的影响。文章指出，随着全球对化石燃料排放的关注度提高和相关规制措施的实施，农业排放的重要性日益凸显。文章认为，需要更深入地研究农业和食物系统对大气化学的影响，以期通过改进耕地管理、牲畜管理和整个食物系统转型来减缓农业排放，最终实现可持续发展目标。虽然文章没有直接提及具体的遥感技术，如卫星类型或传感器，但其研究主题与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为了解农业排放对大气成分的影响，需要借助遥感技术进行大范围、长时间序列的监测和分析，例如利用卫星观测来监测大气中活性氮的浓度变化，并结合地面监测数据进行模型模拟和验证。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有很强的关联性。,"['reactive nitrogen', 'air quality', 'agricultural emissions', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'food security', 'sustainable development']",Amos P. K. Tai;Lina Luo;Biao Luo,Opinion: Understanding the impacts of agriculture and food systems on atmospheric chemistry is instrumental to achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals,"We discuss our current understanding of and knowledge gaps in how agriculture and food systems affect air quality and how agricultural emissions can be mitigated. We argue that scientists need to address these gaps, especially as the importance of fossil fuel emissions is fading. This will help guide food-system transformation in economically viable, socially inclusive, and environmentally responsible ways and is essential to help society achieve sustainable development. 
 Agriculture and food systems play important roles in shaping atmospheric chemistry and air quality, most dominantly via the release of reactive nitrogen (Nr) compounds but also via agricultural burning, energy use, and cropland and pastureland expansion. In this opinion article, we first succinctly review our current understanding of agricultural and food-system emissions of Nr and other atmospherically relevant compounds; their fates and impacts on air quality, human health, and terrestrial ecosystems; and how such emissions can be potentially mitigated through better cropland management, livestock management, and whole-food-system transformation. In doing so, we highlight important knowledge gaps that warrant more extensive research and argue that we scientists need to provide a more detailed, process-based understanding of the impacts of agriculture and food systems on atmospheric chemistry, including both chemical composition and processes, especially as the importance of emissions from other fossil-fuel-intensive sectors is fading in the face of regulatory measures worldwide. Such knowledge is necessary to guide food-system transformation in technologically feasible, economically viable, socially inclusive, and environmentally responsible ways and is essential to help society achieve multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially to ensure food security for people, protect human and ecosystem health, improve farmers' livelihoods, and ultimately help communities achieve socioeconomic and environmental sustainability."
10.5194/amt-18-371-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文关注的是欧洲地区氧合挥发性有机化合物（OVOCs）的精准测量和数据可比性问题。由于OVOCs在大气中的含量低且缺乏稳定的可溯源校准标准，其监测一直具有挑战性。文章的核心在于建立一套可溯源到国际单位制（SI）的OVOCs校准标准，以提高测量精度和数据一致性。研究人员开发了两种类型的可溯源工作标准，并使用热脱附-气相色谱-火焰离子化检测器（TD-GC-FID）和质子转移反应-飞行时间-质谱仪（PTR-ToF-MS）进行了评估。虽然文章主要集中在实验室校准和标准物质的制备，但其最终目标是改进OVOCs的现场监测，这与大气环境遥感技术，特别是地面空气质量监测密切相关。更精确的OVOCs测量数据将有助于更准确地评估对流层臭氧负荷和趋势，从而改进大气成分分析和空气质量模型。,"['Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs)', 'Tropospheric ozone', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Calibration standards', 'Gas chromatography', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Traceability', 'International System of Units (SI)']",Maitane Iturrate-Garcia;Thérèse Salameh;Paul Schlauri;Annarita Baldan;Martin K.

However, the monitoring of many OVOCs remains challenging because of their low atmospheric abundance and lack of stable and traceable calibration standards. This paper describes the calibration standards developed for OVOCs at a low amount of substance fractions (<100 nmol mol-1) to transfer traceability of the International System of Units to the field. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have a large impact on the oxidising capacity of the troposphere and are major precursors of tropospheric ozone and secondary atmospheric aerosols. Accurate measurements and data comparability of VOCs among monitoring networks are essential to assessing the trends of these secondary air pollutants. Metrological traceability of the measurements to the International System of Units (SI traceability) contributes to both measurement consistency and data comparability. Accurate, stable and SI-traceable reference gas mixtures (RGMs) and working standards are needed to achieve SI traceability through an unbroken chain of calibrations of the analytical instruments used to monitor VOCs. However, for many oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), such RGMs and working standards are not available at an atmospheric amount of substance fraction levels (< 10 nmol mol−1). Here, we present the protocols developed to transfer SI traceability to the field by producing two types of SI-traceable working standards for selected OVOCs. These working standards, based on RGMs diluted dynamically with dry nitrogen and on certified spiked whole-air samples, were then assessed using a thermal desorber–gas chromatograph–flame ionisation detector (TD–GC–FID) and proton transfer reaction–time of flight–mass spectrometer (PTR–ToF–MS) as analytical methods. For that purpose, we calibrated five analytical instruments using in-house calibration standards and treated the new SI-traceable working standards as samples. Due to analytical limitations, the assessment was only possible for acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). Relative differences between assigned and measured values were used to assess the working standards based on the dilution of RGMs. The relative differences were within the measurement uncertainty for acetone, MEK, methanol and acetaldehyde at an amount of substance fractions around 10 nmol mol−1. For the working standards based on certified spiked whole-air samples in pressurised cylinders, results showed a good agreement among the laboratories (i.e. differences within the measurement expanded uncertainty (U) ranging between 0.5 and 3.3 nmol mol−1) and with the certified amount of substance fraction for acetaldehyde (15.7 nmol mol−1 ± 3.6 (U) nmol mol−1), acetone (17 nmol mol−1 ± 1.5 (U) nmol mol−1) and MEK (12.3 nmol mol−1 ± 2.3 (U) nmol mol−1). Despite the promising results for the working standards based on the dilution of RGMs and on certified spiked whole-air samples filled into pressurised cylinders, the assessment must be considered with care due to the large measurement uncertainty, particularly for methanol. Active collaboration among the metrological, meteorological and atmospheric chemistry monitoring communities is needed to tackle the challenges of OVOC monitoring, such as the lack of stable and SI-traceable calibration standards (i.e. RGMs and working standards). Besides this collaboration, other research applications, such as modelling and remote sensing, may benefit from the transfer of SI traceability to monitoring stations."

Applied to samples from the Belukha Glacier (1870–1970 CE), the method revealed fluctuating chiral ratios for the analytes. 
 Glaciers are valuable environmental archives that preserve organic compounds from atmospheric aerosols that can be used as marker species for their respective emission sources. Most environmental studies do not distinguish between the enantiomers of chiral compounds, although these compounds, mostly from biogenic sources, are very common in the atmosphere. We have developed a two-dimensional (2D) liquid chromatography (mLC–LC) method that allows the simultaneous determination of the chiral ratios of the monoterpene oxidation products cis-pinic acid and cis-pinonic acid in ice-core samples. The method combines a reversed-phase column in the first dimension and a chiral column in the second dimension in a simple instrumental setup with only one additional six-port valve. This novel method was successfully applied to selected ice-core samples from the Belukha Glacier in the Siberian Altai spread over the period 1870–1970 CE. The chiral ratio of cis-pinic acid showed fluctuating values, while the chiral ratio of cis-pinonic acid remained more constant with an excess of the (−)-enantiomer."

 Ozone profile measurements at high temporal and vertical resolution are needed to better understand physical and chemical processes driving tropospheric ozone variability and to validate the tropospheric ozone measurements from spaceborne missions such as TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution). As part of the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) efforts allocated to provide such measurements and leveraging on the experience of more than 20 years of ozone lidar measurements at Table Mountain Facility, the JPL lidar group developed the SMOL (Small Mobile Ozone Lidar), an affordable differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system covering all altitudes from 200 to 10 km above ground level (a.g.l.). The transmitter is based on a quadrupled Nd:YAG laser, which is further converted into a 289/299 nm wavelength pair using Raman shifting cells, and the receiver consists of three ozone DIAL pairs, including one that is 266/289 nm and two that are 289/299 nm. Two units were deployed in the Los Angeles basin area during the Synergistic TEMPO Air Quality Science (STAQS) and Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) campaigns in summer 2023. The comparison with airborne in situ and lidar measurements shows very good agreement, with systematic differences below 10 % throughout most of the measurement range. An additional comparison with nearby surface ozone measuring instruments indicates unbiased measurements by the SMOL lidars down to 200 m a.g.l. Further comparison with the Goddard Earth Observing System Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) model suggests that such lidars are a critical tool to perform model validation and can potentially be used for assimilation to air quality forecasts."

 Rain gauge measurements are one of the primary techniques used to estimate a precipitation field, but they require careful quality control. This paper describes a modified RainGaugeQC system, which is applied to real-time quality control of rain gauge measurements made every 10-min. This system works operationally at the national meteorological and hydrological service in Poland. The RainGaugeQC algorithms, which have been significantly modified, are described in detail. The modifications were made primarily to control data from non-professional measurement networks, which may be of lower quality than professional data, especially in the case of private stations. Accordingly, the modifications went in the direction of performing more sophisticated data control, applying weather radar data and taking into account various aspects of data quality, such as consistency analysis of data time series, bias detection, etc. The effectiveness of the modified system was verified based on independent measurement data from manual rain gauges, which are considered one of the most accurate measurement instruments, although they mostly provide daily totals. In addition, an analysis of two case studies is presented. This highlights various issues involved in using non-professional data to generate multi-source estimates of the precipitation field."

In this paper, we describe the datasets and algorithms used to generate a GDEM product (IC2-GDEM) by correcting ASTER GDEM (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model) elevation data with ICESat-2 altimeter data. The algorithm scheme presents the details of the strategies used for the various challenges, such as the processing of DEM boundaries, the fusion of the different data, and the geographical layout of the satellite laser altimeter data. We used a high-accuracy global elevation control point dataset and multiple high-accuracy local DEMs as the validation data for a comprehensive assessment at the global scale. The results from the validation comparison show that the elevation accuracy of IC2-GDEM is evidently superior to that of the ASTER GDEM product: (1) the RMSE reduction ratio of the corrected GDEM elevation is between 16 % and 82 %, and the average reduction ratio is about 47 %; and (2) from the analysis of the different topographies and land covers, this error reduction is effective even in areas with high topographic relief (>15°) and high vegetation cover (>60 %). ASTER GDEM has been in use for more than a decade, and many historical datasets and models are based on its elevation data. IC2-GDEM facilitates seamless integration with these historical datasets, which is essential for longitudinal studies examining long-term environmental change, land use dynamics, and climate impacts. Meanwhile, IC2-GDEM can serve as a new complementary data source for existing DEMs (such as Copernicus DEM) mainly sourced from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observation. By cross-validating qualities, filling data gaps, and conducting multi-scale analyses, it can lead to more reliable and comprehensive scientific discoveries, thereby improving the overall quality and reliability of Earth science research.

Spanning 1980 to 2020 with spatial resolution of 0.5° and 1°, BMA-ET uses Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to combine thirty ET datasets. A key innovation is its dynamic weighting scheme, which adjusts for different vegetation types and non-common coverage years among ET datasets. BMA-ET provides a comprehensive resource for understanding global ET patterns and trends, addressing the limitation of prior ET fusion efforts. 
 Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the terrestrial water cycle, carbon cycle, and energy balance. Currently, there are four main types of ET datasets: remote sensing–based, machine learning–based, reanalysis–based, and land–surface–model–based. However, most existing ET fusion datasets rely on a single type of ET dataset, limiting their ability to effectively capture regional ET variations. This limitation hinders accurate quantification of the terrestrial water balance and understanding of climate change impacts. In this study, the accuracy and uncertainty of thirty ET datasets (across all four types) are evaluated at multiple spatial scales, and a fusion dataset BMA(Bayesian model averaging)-ET, is obtained using BMA method and dynamic weighting scheme for different vegetation types and non-common cover years among ET datasets. ET from FLUXNET as reference, the study recommends remote sensing– and machine learning–based ET datasets, especially Model Tree Ensemble Evapotranspiration (MTE) and Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML), but the optimal selection depends on season and vegetation type. At the basin scale, land–surface–model–based ET datasets have less relative uncertainty compared to other types of ET. At the global scale, the uncertainty is lower in regions with larger ET, such as the Amazon, Central and Southern Africa, and Southeast Asia. The BMA-ET dataset accurately captures trends and seasonal variability in ET, showing a global terrestrial increasing trend of 0.21 mm·yr−1 over the study period. BMA-ET has higher correlation coefficients and lower root-mean-square errors than most individual ET datasets. Validation using ET from FLUXNET as reference shows that correlation coefficients of more than 70 % of the flux sites exceed 0.8. Overall, BMA-ET provides a comprehensive, long-term resource for understanding global ET patterns and trends, addressing the limitation of prior ET fusion efforts.

A new urban radiation model, assuming a more realistic form of urban morphology, is coupled to the urban climate model Town Energy Balance (TEB). The new TEB is evaluated with a reference radiation model for a variety of urban morphologies, and an improvement in the simulated radiative observables is found. 
 The urban canopy model Town Energy Balance (TEB) is coupled with the radiation model SPARTACUS-Urban to improve the urban geometry simplification and the radiative transfer calculation. SPARTACUS-Urban assumes that the probability density function of wall-to-wall and ground-to-wall distances follows a decreasing exponential. This better matches the distributions in real cities than in the infinitely long street canyon employed by the classical TEB. SPARTACUS-Urban solves the radiative transfer equation using the discrete ordinate method. This allows us to take into account physical processes such as the interaction of radiation with the air in the urban canopy layer and the spectral dependence of urban material reflectivities or specular reflections. Such processes would be more difficult to account for with the radiosity method used by the classical TEB. With SPARTACUS-Urban, the mean radiant temperature, a crucial parameter for outdoor human thermal comfort, can be calculated from the radiative fluxes in the vertical and horizontal directions incident on the human body in an urban environment. TEB–SPARTACUS is validated by comparing the solar and terrestrial urban radiation budget observables with those simulated by the Monte-Carlo-based HTRDR-Urban reference model for procedurally generated urban districts that mimic the local climate zones. Improvement is found for almost all radiative observables and urban morphologies for direct solar, diffuse solar, and terrestrial infrared radiation. The TEB mean radiant temperature diagnostic for a person in the urban environment is also improved with TEB–SPARTACUS compared with the classical TEB. Based on these results, TEB–SPARTACUS could lead to more realistic results for building energy consumption, outdoor human thermal comfort, or the urban heat island effect."

Our findings indicate that the model performs very well in simulating dissolved oxygen profiles, nutrient concentrations, and organic matter levels. 
 This study set out to assess the performance of the state-of-the-art CE-QUAL-W2 v4.5 sediment diagenesis model. The model was applied to a reservoir in Portugal using observed sediment particulate organic carbon values corresponding to a six-year period (2016–2021). The model was calibrated by comparing its results with 35 observed dissolved oxygen and water temperature profiles, as well as annual total nitrogen, total phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand, and chlorophyll-a measurements corresponding to three different depths. In addition to model calibration, a sensitivity analysis was also conducted by varying the input particulate organic carbon values and applying a user-specified sediment oxygen model (zero-order model). The results demonstrated the overall effectiveness of the sediment diagenesis model, which accurately simulated dissolved oxygen profiles, nutrient concentrations, and organic matter levels (Dissolved oxygen profiles: NSE = 0.41 ± 0.67; RMSE = 1.73 mg/L ± 0.69), highlighting its potential as an effective tool for simulating lakes and reservoirs and supporting water management processes. The study further suggests that the zero-order model is able to serve as an effective starting point for implementing the sediment diagenesis model, providing an initial estimate for mean reservoir sediment oxygen demand (SOD) values."

Comparison with ERA5 and observational data reveals that the iAMAS model performs well in simulating the Antarctic atmosphere; iAMAS demonstrates comparable, and in some cases superior, performance in simulating temperature and wind speed in East Antarctica when compared to ERA5. 
 Regular latitude-longitude grids in global simulations encounter polar singularities in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. In contrast, unstructured meshes have the potential to overcome this issue; however, so far, the performance of unstructured meshes in polar areas is barely investigated. This study examined the efficacy of unstructured meshes over Antarctica using the integrated Atmospheric Model Across Scales (iAMAS, v1.0) with multi-source observations. Four mesh configurations of the iAMAS model were assessed, varying in resolutions (120 km, 60 km, 16 km, and 4 km) over the Antarctic region. The study evaluates the iAMAS simulation performance for both surface layer and upper meteorological fields (temperature, pressure, specific humidity, and wind speed), by comparing simulations against the fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and measurements from automatic weather stations and radiosondes. The results indicate that the iAMAS model does not exhibit the polar singularity issue observed in ERA5, where the ERA5 with regular latitude-longitude grids significantly underestimates wind speeds at the polar grid center (i.e., the South Pole at 90° S). In the relatively flat region of East Antarctica, all four iAMAS experiments at various resolutions demonstrate comparable and even superior performance in simulating temperature and wind speed when compared to ERA5. In regions with complex terrain, such as near the Transantarctic Mountains, the iAMAS model (particularly at coarse grid resolutions like 120 km) exhibits a cold bias and stronger wind speeds, consistent with biases identified in other Antarctic simulations using regional models with latitude-longitude grids. Notably, mesh refinement at 4 km in complex terrains significantly enhance iAMAS’s accuracy in simulating the meteorological fields for both the surface layer and upper atmosphere, suggesting that a grid resolution of 4 km (or even higher) is optimal in such regions. Conversely, in flatter areas, like the high East Antarctic plateau, increases in grid resolution yield minimal improvements in simulation accuracy, and a 60-km grid resolution appears sufficient."

However, due to their extreme environmental persistence and their impacts on human and ecosystem health, PFAS have been subject to many regulatory activities, including initiatives to incentivize industry to transition toward PFAS-free alternatives. Although efforts have been made to map all uses of PFAS, work is still needed to provide an overview of their potential alternatives. Based on the functional substitution approach, this study develops an online database that documents all known uses of PFAS, describes the functions provided by PFAS in these uses, lists potential alternatives that can deliver equivalent or similar functions to PFAS, and evaluates the suitability of the identified alternatives to replace PFAS. Overall, the database lists 325 different applications of PFAS across 18 use categories. In total, 530 PFAS-free alternatives are identified. Based on a screening of potential concerns of the identified alternatives, their performance compared to PFAS, and their availability on the market, it is concluded that potentially suitable alternatives to PFAS are available for 40 different applications. For 83 applications, no alternatives could be identified at the time of the study and should be the focus of further research activities."

The current study assessed the appropriateness of pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) analysis for the quantification of a range of polymers in human blood. An extraction protocol that reduced matrix interferences (false positives) of polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was developed and validated. Extraction recoveries ranged 7–109%, although surface-modified polystyrene (carboxylated) increased nanoparticle recoveries from 17 to 52%. Realistic detection limits were calculated for each polymer, accounting for matrix suppression and extraction recovery. These were up to 20 times higher than nominal detection limits calculated with Milli-Q water. Finally, the method was tested with a pilot study of the Australian population. PE interferences were reduced but still present, and no other polymers were above detection limits. It was concluded that Py-GC-MS is currently not a suitable analysis method for PE and PVC in biological matrices due to the presence of interferences and nonspecific pyrolysis products. Furthermore, while it is plausible to detect some polymers in blood, the estimated exposure concentrations needed are approaching the detection limits of the technique."

Agricultural fields with varying degrees of saltwater intrusion, unaffected control, and native tidal marsh were studied to understand the impacts of saltwater intrusion on soil properties and soil carbon dynamics. SWI increased soil EC and decreased the nutrient-holding capacity, affecting crop production. SWI promoted the loss of water-soluble labile SOC, which was found to be linked to the destabilization of the labile SOC associated with  poorly crystalline Fe-oxides. This destabilization potentially resulted from the reductive dissolution of poorly crystalline Fe-oxides caused by fluctuating redox conditions following the periodic saltwater intrusion.

This study demonstrates that at recommended husbandry concentrations, MB significantly reduces zebrafish locomotion in a 24 h behavior assay, a finding consistent across strains and laboratories. Gene expression profiling and pharmacological experiments using the MAO-inhibitor deprenyl suggest that MB induces hypolocomotion by increasing the serotonergic tone. Importantly, MB use in standard embryo medium masks known hypolocomotor responses to fluoxetine, a common aquatic contaminant and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor.

A conventional design uses lignin for on-site heat and power, which exports excess power to the grid. An alternative design exports lignin pellets, offsetting other pellet production methods but requiring grid electricity to meet biorefinery power demands. Net emissions were quantified in Iowa and Georgia, selected considering feedstock availability, coproduct displacement, and regional power grids, assuming grid-exported power avoids coal or low-carbon electricity. Results for the conventional design remained consistent across the electricity displacement scenarios. When comparing lignin utilization strategies, pelletizing lignin reduces sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds (net emissions −0.66 mg MJ–1, 25 mg MJ–1, 25 mg MJ–1, 7.8 mg MJ–1, respectively). However, lignin pelletization increases net particulate matter (fine and coarse) and ammonia (net emissions of 4.7 mg MJ–1, 13 mg MJ–1, and 0.26 mg MJ–1, respectively), alongside indirect GHG emissions due to grid electricity dependence. Additionally, processing 2000 tonnes corn stover daily minimizes emissions for both designs. Only lignin pelletization with renewable electricity and additional particulate matter and ammonia controls reduces all CAP and GHG emissions simultaneously."

The short lifecycle of the Atlantic Niño and the lack of precursor signals beyond about one season lead time have hindered the development of forecasts with useful accuracy and lead time. In this study, we propose a new approach to Atlantic Niño forecasting that extends beyond the Atlantic region by incorporating longer‐lasting precursors in the Pacific associated with El Niño‐Southern Oscillation events. Using this prediction framework, we can hindcast the Atlantic Niño with skill up to three seasons in advance. Our results highlight the critical role of inter‐basin interactions in shaping regional and global climate patterns, and provide new hope for improving seasonal climate prediction capabilities in the tropical Atlantic. Plain Summary Despite extensive efforts made by the climate research community, the equatorial Atlantic region, in particular the Atlantic Niño phenomenon, consistently demonstrates poor seasonal forecasting capabilities. In this study, we propose a new approach to Atlantic Niño forecasting by using longer‐lasting precursors in the Pacific. The new prediction framework enables skillful prediction of the boreal summer Atlantic Niño events up to three seasons in advance. The results of our study have the possibility to reduce the existing gap in seasonal prediction for the equatorial Atlantic region by leveraging inter‐basin information, particularly benefitting vulnerable communities in the tropical Atlantic basin."

A significant decrease in the daytime disk temperatures (∼100 K) was seen near the peak annularity compared to the day before (baseline). The temperature reduction's spatial morphology is also like that of the eclipse shadow. Previous modeling studies of other eclipses typically show a much smaller temperature decrease (∼30–40 K; a factor of 2–3 lower) compared to GOLD observations.

SWOT‐derived surface water elevations captured 99% of water level variability compared to in situ observations. Additionally, flooding in Patos Lagoon was intensified by NE–SW wind forcing, causing water levels to rise by up to 40 cm, worsening the flood event.

Diagnostic analysis reveals that the westward winds in the Southern (summer) Hemisphere were anomalously strong (maximum of ∼90 m/s) during December 2023, which significantly shortened the e‐folding time of QTDW‐W3, and additionally generated the QTDW‐W3 critical layers at the tropical summer stratopause from December 7.

However, MPs have not been considered as contributors to INP concentrations. Here, we quantify road traffic‐related MP number concentrations, and estimate their contribution to total INP concentrations using the atmospheric transport model FLEXPART. We find that under a high emission scenario ice‐active MPs can account from about 0.1% to more than 40% of the total INP number in immersion freezing conditions in the tropics, whereas for cirrus conditions, their contribution can be up to about 7% over the tropical Pacific and up to about 20% over East Antarctica. Thus, in regions where other effective INPs are rare, ice‐active MP concentrations may be sufficient to trigger heterogeneous nucleation of ice crystals in mixed‐phase clouds or cirrus. This suggests that MP may affect cloud formation and highlights the need to reduce uncertainty in MP emissions and their fate in the atmosphere as plastic use continues to grow."

The ice core chronology is based on variability in nitrate and calcium ions, which reveal an apparently seasonal periodicity (with winter maxima) throughout the core's length. Two annual boundaries are consistent with the tritium peak representing nuclear tests conducted in 1963 CE and with the spike in sulfate ions due to the eruption of Krakatau in 1883 CE. The ice core spans 145 years from 1875 to 2019 CE. Dating uncertainties due to the layer counting methodology were estimated as ±1 $\pm 1$ year for 1963–2019 CE and ±2 $\pm 2$ years for 1875–1963 CE. Comparison with earlier ice cores drilled on the northern side of the Himalayas revealed that the ion components exhibit inverse correlations with two key climatic indices: the North Atlantic Oscillation and Southern Oscillation Index.

However, challenges persist in gaining actionable insights into the changing magnitude and spatial variability of these hazards. We employ a physics‐based hydrodynamic framework to numerically simulate compound flooding from TCs and ETCs in both current and future climates, focusing on the western side of Buzzards Bay in Massachusetts. Our approach leverages hydrodynamic models driven by extensive sets of synthetic TCs downscaled from CMIP6 climate models. We also perform a far less extensive analysis of ETCs using a previously produced event set, dynamically downscaled using the WRF model driven by a single CMIP5 model. This methodology quantifies how climate change may reshape the compound flooding hazard landscape in the study area. Our findings reveal a significant increase in TC‐induced compound flooding hazard due to evolving climatology and sea level rise (SLR). Although compound flooding induced by ETCs increases mostly in coastal areas due to SLR, inland areas exhibit almost no change, and some even show a decline in rainfall‐driven flooding from high‐frequency ETC events toward the end of the century compared to the current climate. Our methodology is transferable to vulnerable coastal regions, serving as a tool for adaptive measures in populated areas. It equips decision‐makers and stakeholders with the means to mitigate the destructive impacts of compound flooding arising from both current and future TCs, and shows how the same methodology might be applied to ETCs."

Aiuppa,Escalation of caldera unrest indicated by increasing emission of isotopically light sulfur,"The recent increase in isotopically light sulfur emissions from Campi Flegrei (Italy) is probably the result of degassing magma at ≥6 km depth and could be an indicator of caldera reawakening generally, according to observations and simulations. 
 Calderas are depressions formed by some of the largest volcanic eruptions. Their long-lived inter-eruptive periods are occasionally interrupted by phases of unrest, in which escalating seismicity, ground deformation and gas emissions raise concerns of potential volcano reawakening. However, interpretation of such physico-chemical signals is complicated by few examples of monitored unrest that culminated into eruption and by our fragmentary understanding of the drivers and timescales of caldera reactivation. Here we show that multi-decadal gas observations at the restless Campi Flegrei caldera in Italy record an unprecedented increase in isotopically light sulfur release from fumaroles since 2018. We then use hydrothermal gas equilibria and numerical simulations of magmatic degassing to propose that such a change in sulfur emissions results from decompression-driven degassing of mafic magma at ≥6 km depth, along with some extent of sulfur remobilization from hydrothermal minerals. Examination of a global dataset indicates that, despite the diversity in eruptive behaviour and tectonic setting, increasing sulfur output may be a common process during unrest escalation at calderas generally. Hence, our observations and models of sulfur behaviour may inform interpretations of unrest and hazard assessment at reawakening calderas and hydrothermal active volcanoes worldwide. The recent increase in isotopically light sulfur emissions from Campi Flegrei (Italy) is probably the result of degassing magma at ≥6 km depth and could be an indicator of caldera reawakening generally, according to observations and simulations."

 The stabilization of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from organic inputs in soil organic matter constitutes a critical process in ecosystem biogeochemistry, yet the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Several frameworks have been proposed to explain particulate- and mineral-associated organic matter persistence, but a lack of long-term data has stymied their reconciliation. Here we present the results of an in-field incubation in a grassland in Kansas, USA, that followed 13C- and 15N-labelled plant litter and pyrogenic organic matter through the decomposition process and into soil organic matter fractions over the course of a decade. At the end of the experiment, 7.0% and 24.2% of the initial litter C and N, respectively, remained in the soil, while 60.8% and 54.4% of the initial pyrogenic organic matter C and N, respectively, remained. Litter-derived mineral-associated organic matter formed within the first year of litter decomposition, and 10-year sampling revealed that it had persisted relatively unchanged, in terms of both litter-derived C stocks and C:N ratio. These results provide further evidence that mineral-associated organic matter is stabilized via the sorption of soluble inputs and suggest that stabilization and persistence can occur largely independent of particulate organic matter dynamics.

This study introduces adjacent B-Ni single-atomic sites as an electron reservoir to precisely control electron transfer pathways, enabling both high catalytic activity and stability. 
 Precisely managing electron transfer pathways throughout the catalytic reaction is paramount for bolstering both the efficacy and endurance of catalysts, offering a pivotal solution to addressing concerns surrounding host structure destabilization and cycling life degradation. This paper describes the integration of B-Ni dual single-atoms within MnO2 channels to serve as an electronic reservoir to direct the electron transfer route during methane catalytic combustion. Comprehensive analysis discovers that B atoms weaken the interaction between O and Mn atoms by forming bonds with lattice oxygen atoms. Meanwhile, Ni atoms facilitate electron transfer to achieve the heightened activity of MnO2. The B-Ni dual-sites instead of Mn (IV) could accommodate excess electrons generated during the reaction to inhibit the formation of high spin Mn (III) species, thereby hindering the Jahn-Teller distortion and maintaining the catalyst stability. This work demonstrates an effective modification strategy to substantially prolong the service life of MnO2-based materials.

 Regulator of cell death-1 (RCD-1) governs the heteroallelic expression of RCD-1-1 and RCD-1-2, a pair of fungal gasdermin (GSDM)-like proteins, which prevent cytoplasmic mixing during allorecognition and safeguard against mycoparasitism, genome exploitation, and deleterious cytoplasmic elements (e.g., senescence plasmids) by effecting a form of cytolytic cell death. However, the underlying mechanisms by which RCD-1 acts on the cell membrane remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that RCD-1 binds acidic lipid membranes, forms pores, and induces membrane bending. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and AlphaFold, we show that RCD-1-1 and RCD-1-2 form heterodimers that further self-assemble into ~14.5 nm-wide transmembrane pores (~10 heterodimers). Moreover, through AFM force spectroscopy and micropipette aspiration, we reveal that RCD-1 proteins bend membranes with low bending moduli. This combined action of pore formation and membrane deformation may constitute a conserved mechanism within the broader GSDM family.

Here, the authors show that lactylated Serpina3k/SERPINA3 secreted from fibroblasts during reperfusion protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis in a paracrine fashion. 
 Lactate produced during ischemia-reperfusion injury is known to promote lactylation of proteins, which play controversial roles. By analyzing the lactylomes and proteomes of mouse myocardium during ischemia-reperfusion injury using mass spectrometry, we show that both Serpina3k protein expression and its lactylation at lysine 351 are increased upon reperfusion. Both Serpina3k and its human homolog, SERPINA3, are abundantly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts, but not  in cardiomyocytes. Biochemically, lactylation of Serpina3k enhances protein stability. Using Serpina3k knockout mice and mice overexpressing its lactylation-deficient mutant, we find that Serpina3k protects from cardiac injury in a lysine 351 lactylation-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ischemia-reperfusion-stimulated fibroblasts secrete Serpina3k/SERPINA3, and protect cardiomyocytes from reperfusion-induced apoptosis in a paracrine fashion, partially through the activation of cardioprotective reperfusion injury salvage kinase and survivor activating factor enhancement pathways.

 Phase separation of specific proteins into liquid-like condensates is a key mechanism for forming membrane-less organelles, which organize diverse cellular processes in space and time. These protein condensates hold immense potential as biomaterials capable of containing specific sets of biomolecules with high densities and dynamic liquid properties. Despite their appeal, methods to manipulate protein condensate materials remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a one-pot assembly method to assemble coalescence-resistant protein condensates, ranging from a few μm to 100 nm in sizes, with surface-stabilizing protein cages. We discover that large protein cages (~30 nm), finely tuned to interact with condensates, efficiently localize on condensate surfaces and prevent the merging (coalescence) of condensates during phase separation. We precisely control condensate diameters by modulating condensate/cage ratios. In addition, the 3D structures of intact protein condensates with interfacial cages are visualized with cryo-electron tomography (ET).

 C–C bond cleavage and recombination provide an efficient strategy for the modification and reconstruction of molecule structures.

This method marks the instance of precise and controlled stepwise cleavage of C–C triple bond, offering a fresh perspective for the cleavage of such bonds. Nitrous acid ester serves as both a radical source and a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagent to functionalize and utilize the two carbon atoms of the C–C triple bond. The alkoxy radical captures the hydrogen atom from the aryl C(sp2)–H bond or N-hydroxyl to induce the 1,3-oxygen radical migration, which is crucial for the subsequent cleavage of the C–C bond.

 Lysosomes are best known for their roles in inflammatory responses by engaging in autophagy to remove inflammasomes. Here, we describe an unrecognized role for the lysosome, showing that it finely controls macrophage inflammatory function by manipulating the lysosomal Fe2+—prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs)—NF-κB—interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) transcription pathway that directly links lysosomes with inflammatory responses. TRPML1, a lysosomal cationic channel, is activated secondarily to ROS elevation upon inflammatory stimuli, which in turn suppresses IL1B transcription, thus limiting the excessive production of IL-1β in macrophages. Mechanistically, the suppression of IL1B transcription caused by TRPML1 activation results from its modulation on the release of lysosomal Fe2+, which subsequently activates PHDs. The activated PHDs then represses transcriptional activity of NF-κB, ultimately resulting in suppressed IL1B transcription. More importantly, in vivo stimulation of TRPML1 ameliorates multiple clinical signs of Dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice, suggesting TRPML1 has potential in treating inflammatory bowel disease.

 Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes."

 Global warming has accelerated lake salinization, driving changes in microbial community structure and function. However, the dynamics of viral communities in response to salinity remain unclear. Here, we apply metagenomic sequencing to a lake on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, spanning a broad salinity gradient, to investigate viral community dynamics. Our findings reveal that salinity strongly influences viral composition and modulates viral lifestyles. Temperate viruses increase in relative abundance along the salinity gradient, whereas virulent viruses show a corresponding decline. These shifts are mirrored in the prokaryotic communities, with Alphaproteobacteria and their infecting temperate viruses, notably Casadabanvirus, becoming more prevalent in higher salinity zones. Viral genomes encode genes associated with osmotic stress adaptation, DNA recombination, and nutrient transport, which may facilitate host adaptation to saline stress.

However, these orbiters only capture instantaneous LSTs at specific overpass times within a diurnal cycle, thus limiting the analysis of temporally sensitive SUHI metrics such as daily mean, maximum, and minimum SUHI intensity (SUHII). Consequently, the representativeness of daily clear-sky SUHI climatology derived from these instantaneous LSTs remains unclear, especially across global cities. Here we employ Aqua & Terra MODIS LST data alongside a well-established diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model to assess such representativeness of daily clear-sky SUHI climatology, primarily based on the SUHII biases estimated from DTC-derived diurnally continuous and satellite-based temporally discrete LSTs across global cities. This approach discloses the fidelity of satellite-derived instantaneous LSTs to in representing daily clear-sky SUHI climatology. We further dissect the drivers of SUHII biases using the LightGBM model and SHAP algorithm. Our results reveal substantial underestimation of daily mean and maximum SUHIIs alongside overestimation of minimum SUHII when compared to the estimates directly based on instantaneous LSTs. The annual global mean SUHII biases for daily mean, maximum, and minimum conditions are 0.21 ± 0.13 K, 0.51 ± 0.18 K, and − 0.43 ± 0.17 K, respectively. We observe substantial seasonal and geographic variability in SUHII biases, with greater SUHII biases during winter, in snow climates, and across Europe and Oceania when compared to other seasons, climates, and continents. Notably, background climate is the principal contributor (34 %) to variation in SUHII bias, followed by surface properties (28 %), urban metrics (20 %), and human activity (18 %). Our findings emphasize the importance and show the feasibility of correcting SUHII biases in daily clear-sky SUHI climatology derived from instantaneous LSTs from polar orbiters across global cities."

 Satellite burned area, active fire and fire radiative power (FRP), are key to quantifying fire activity and are one of 54 essential climate variables (ECV) and it is important to validate these data to ensure their consistency. This study investigates some of the factors that influence FRP retrieval and uses Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) data to do so. Analysis of the influence of a fire’s location within a SEVIRI pixel on FRP was carried out using fire simulations which indicate that FRP varies by up to 14 % at nadir for a single sensor and by up to 55 % when intercomparing simulated FRP from different SEVIRI sensors. Intercomparison between actual MET-11 and MET-08 FRP data on a per-pixel basis reveals a high degree of scatter (81.9 MW), strong correlation (R = 0.72), low bias (∼1 MW) and an average percentage difference of 15.7 %. Variability is reduced when aggregated to fire ‘clusters’ which improves the correlation (R = 0.96) and reduces the average percentage difference (4.2 %). Validation of MET-08 and MET-11 FRP retrievals using FRP from helicopter mounted longwave infrared (LWIR) and midwave infrared (MWIR) thermal cameras is carried out over five prescribed burns. The results reveal good agreement between the SEVIRI and thermal camera FRP although the SEVIRI FRP is typically overestimated compared to that from the LWIR camera. This study illustrates some of the challenges validating satellite FRP which should be accounted for when defining uncertainty thresholds for product requirements and in developing FRP validation protocols."

 Surface air temperature (SAT) is an essential climate variable (ECV). Models based on remote sensing data allow us to study SAT, without the need for a large network of meteorological stations. Therefore, it allows monitoring the climate in remote and extensive areas. Niclos et al. (2014) proposed parametric equations for the SAT retrieval over the Spanish Mediterranean basins. In this study, we evaluated those equations, but in a larger area and period of study. In addition, we proposed several linear regression models and nonlinear models based on decision tree methods, non-parametric methods and neuronal networks. These models relate SAT to land surface temperature, vegetation indexes and albedo from MODIS data. Moreover, meteorological reanalysis data, from ERA5-Land database, and geographical parameters were used. The accuracy of each model was evaluated against data from meteorological stations operated by AEMET in the Spanish Mediterranean basins, during the period 2021–2022. The equations of Niclos et al. (2014) obtained a robust root mean square error (RRMSE) of 3.1 K at daytime and 1.9 K at nighttime. For the linear regression models, the RRMSE decreased to 2.3 K (1.5 K) at daytime (nighttime). Finally, the nonlinear methods, in particular XGBoost model, showed an RRMSE of 1.5 K for daytime and 1.0 K at nighttime. Therefore, the comparison between methods showed that nonlinear models, in particular those based on decision tree methods, offered the best results in SAT retrieval in our study."

 Rapid urbanization can cause serious air pollution and human health problems in densely populated cities. Urban areas have complex surface characteristics that can highly impact microclimate and air quality in these environments. Cities are typically warmer than their surroundings due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect caused by anthropogenic activities and unique urban surface properties. However, the UHI impacts on air quality and aerosol forecasts in major cities have not been well understood yet. The objective of this paper is to address this knowledge gap by characterizing the impacts of the UHI on meteorological and aerosol forecasts in cities. To this end, more than 30 days of simulations over two major US cities (Houston and Dallas) are performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). In total, 78 simulations are conducted by varying the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) schemes, urban models, and various UHI magnitudes. Our results indicate that the current urban schemes in WRF do not accurately parameterize UHI effects which can highly influence their air pollution and meteorological forecasts. The lack of proper UHI representation causes a more stable atmosphere during nighttime as the model does not account for additional heating that occurs in major cities. This leads to the accumulation of aerosol forecasts on urban surfaces and overestimated particulate matter forecasts. By enhancing the UHI representation, we were able to remarkably improve the default WRF-Chem forecasts of particulate matter and ozone by an average of ∼50 % and ∼12 % in Houston, respectively. Similar improvements were obtained for Dallas, and different PBL and urban schemes. The study underscores the significance of urban-specific models such as the UHI effect for accurate meteorological and aerosol forecasts in cities."

 Dry-to-wet abrupt alteration events (DWAA) are characterized by the rapid transition from drought to heavy rainfall, with serious impacts on agricultural production and society in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). However, a key research gap is the lack of comprehensive DWAA identification methods to accurately capture short-term DWAA features. Here, an improved pentad-scale DWAA index combining standardized soil moisture indexes and standardized precipitation indexes is proposed and the temporal and spatial characteristics of DWAA are identified using ERA5-Land reanalysis data. The results show that, from 1980 to 2022, the average of frequency, duration, strength, and rate of rapid alteration of DWAA in the YRB have significantly increased. Compared with the 1980s, the average duration of DWAA extended from 6.2 pentads to 6.3 pentads in the 2010s, and the average rapid alteration rate increased from 2.8 pentad−1 to 2.9 pentad−1. High occurrence areas of DWAA (20 times) were observed in east and south of the YRB and northwestern Sichuan. These regions also experienced prolonged duration of up to 13 pentads and great strength of 17. Based on the Cumulative Distribution Function and Copula function, the average state of DWAA (50th percentile, duration of 5 pentads, strength of 8.2) had a recurrence period of 1 year, while extreme state events (90th percentile, duration of 9 pentads, strength of 15.1) had a recurrence period of 90 years. These findings can provide an important scientific basis for local governments to improve the regional responding capacity and development of disaster prevention and mitigation policies."

Although the incorporation of dynamic interactions enhances self-healing capabilities, it simultaneously weakens the hydrogels’ strength. External stimuli such as heating, while accelerating the healing process, may also lead to dehydration. Developing a stable repair strategy that combines rapid healing and high mechanical strength is challenging. Here, we introduce “salt-welding” for high-strength hydrogels with rapid room temperature self-healing. This is achieved through dynamic borate ester bonds in a salt-responsive poly(methacrylamide) hydrogel. The process involves “salt-fusion” to convert fractures into a viscous liquid for swift healing, followed by “salt-concretion” to toughen the hydrogel. The hydrogels achieve a posthealing strength of 23 megapascals in 95 minutes at room temperature, with near 100% healing efficiency. Leveraging their tunable mechanical strength and rapid healing rate, the hydrogel can be tailored for applications as a reparable wear-resistant material and damping device."

Here, we demonstrate that photothermal nonlinear scattering microscopy can be used for direct imaging and resolving of integrated optoelectronic chips beyond the diffraction limit. We reveal that the inherent coupling among deep-subwavelength nanostructures supporting leaky resonances allows for the pronounced heating effect to access reversible nonlinear modulations of the confocal reflection intensity, yielding optical resolving power down to 80 nm (~λ/7). The versatility of this approach has been exemplified by imaging silicon grating couplers and metalens with minimum critical dimensions of 100 nm, as well as central processing unit chip with 45-nm technology, unfolding the long-sought possibility of in situ, nondestructive, high-throughput optical inspection of integrated optoelectronic and nanophotonic chips."

To shed light on the evolutionary emergence of the vertebrate brain, we compared anterior neuroectoderm development across deuterostome species, using available single-cell datasets from sea urchin, amphioxus, and zebrafish embryos. We identified a conserved gene co-expression module, comparable to the anterior gene regulatory network (aGRN) controlling apical organ development in ambulacrarians, and spatially mapped it by multiplexed in situ hybridization to the developing retina and hypothalamus of chordates. Using functional approaches, we show Wnt signaling regulating this co-expression module in amphioxus, like the aGRN in echinoderms, and that its overactivation suppresses forebrain identity. This suggests a previously undescribed role for Wnt signaling in amphioxus in determining the position of the forebrain.

Here, we investigate the substrate specificity of the MOP transporters in the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) synthesis pathway inStreptococcus pneumoniae. These capsule flippases collectively transport more than 100 types of capsule precursors. To determine whether they can substitute for one another, we developed a high-throughput approach to systematically examine nearly 6000 combinations of flippases and substrates. CPS flippases fall into three groups: relaxed, type-specific, and strictly specific. Cargo size and CPS acetylation affect transport, and we isolated additional gain-of-function flippase variants that can substitute for the peptidoglycan flippase YtgP (MurJ). We also showed that combining flippase variants in a single cassette allows various CPS precursors to be flipped, which may aid glycoengineering.

Our recent studies revealed that promoter-proximal Pol II is destabilized via the ubiquitin E3 ligase cullin 3 (CUL3) upon loss of transcription elongation factor SPT5. Here, we investigate how CUL3 recognizes chromatin-bound Pol II as a substrate. Using an unbiased proteomic screening approach, we identify armadillo repeat-containing 5 (ARMC5) as a CUL3 adaptor required for VCP/p97-dependent degradation of SPT5-depleted, chromatin-bound Pol II. Genome-wide analyses indicate that ARMC5 targets promoter-proximal Pol II in a BTB domain–dependent manner. Further biochemical analysis demonstrates that interaction between ARMC5 and Pol II requires the transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), supporting a phospho-dependent degradation model. We propose that defective, promoter-proximal Pol II that lacks SPT5 is rapidly eliminated from chromatin in a noncanonical early termination pathway that requires CDK9-dependent interaction with the CUL3-ARMC5 ubiquitin ligase complex."

To address this problem, we investigated respiratory epithelia as their contact with air exposes them to some of the highest O2levels in the body. We asked how the O2level in air controls differentiation of airway basal stem cells into the ciliated epithelial cells essential for clearing airborne pathogens from the lung. Through a metabolomics screen and13C tracing on primary cultures of human airway basal cells, we found that the O2level in air directs ciliated cell differentiation by increasing mitochondrial citrate export. Unexpectedly, disrupting mitochondrial citrate export elicited hypoxia transcriptional responses independently of HIF1α stabilization and at O2levels that would be hyperoxic for most tissues.
