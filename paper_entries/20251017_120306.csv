We quantify each system’s mixing and measurement noise effects, which impact the achievable resolution of isotope continuous records. Our findings reveal specific configurations and procedures to enhance measurement accuracy, providing a framework to optimise water isotope analysis. 
 The continuous flow analysis technique coupled with cavity ring-down spectrometry (CFA-CRDS) provides a method for high-resolution water isotope analysis of ice cores, which is essential for paleoclimatic reconstructions of local temperatures and regional atmospheric circulation. Compared to the traditional discrete method, CFA-CRDS significantly reduces analysis time. However, the effective resolution at which the isotopic signal can be retrieved from continuous measurements is influenced by system-induced mixing, which smooths the isotopic signal, and by measurement noise, which can further limit the resolution of the continuous record, introducing random fluctuations into the instrument's signal output. This study compares three CFA-CRDS systems developed at Ca' Foscari University (Venice), the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (Paris), and the Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement (Grenoble) for firn core analysis. Continuous results are compared with discrete data to highlight the strengths and limitations of each system. A spectral analysis is also performed to quantify the impact of internal mixing on signal integrity and to determine the frequency limits imposed by measurement noise. These findings establish the effective resolution limits for retrieving isotopic signals from firn cores. Finally, we discuss critical system configurations and procedural optimisations that enhance the accuracy and resolution of water isotope analysis in ice cores."

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of several multi-source emission quantification models using data from fixed-point continuous monitoring systems (CMSs), collected during a controlled-release study. This work offers a novel contribution by evaluating multi-source emissions quantification techniques, leveraging a fixed-point CMS to capture the complexities of overlapping plumes from simultaneous releases. 
 Quantifying methane emissions from oil and gas facilities is crucial for emissions management and accurate facility-level greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory development. This paper evaluates the performance of several multi-source methane emission quantification models using the data collected by fixed-point continuous monitoring systems as part of a controlled-release experiment. Two dispersion modeling approaches (Gaussian plume, Gaussian puff) and two inversion frameworks (least-squares optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo) are applied to the measurement data. In addition, a subset of experiments are selected to showcase the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) informed calculations for direct solution of the advection–diffusion equation. This solution utilizes a three-dimensional wind field informed by solving the momentum equation with the appropriate external forcing to match on-site wind measurements. Results show that the Puff model, driven by high-frequency wind data, significantly improves localization and reduces bias and error variance compared to the Plume model. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based inversion framework further enhances accuracy over least-squares fitting, with the Puff MCMC approach showing the best performance. The study highlights the importance of long-term integration for accurate total mass emission estimates and the detection of anomalous emission patterns. The findings of this study can help improve emissions management strategies, aid in facility-level emissions risk assessment, and enhance the accuracy of greenhouse gas inventories."
10.5194/amt-18-5415-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文主要研究利用多角度偏振卫星测量数据，通过神经网络方法来探测和反演云上气溶胶。该研究开发了一个基于神经网络的算法，用于检测云上气溶胶（ACA）并反演其性质，包括气溶胶光学厚度（AOT）、埃格斯特朗指数（AE）和单次散射反照率（SSA）。该算法应用于PARASOL卫星数据，并通过合成数据实验验证了其反演能力。结果表明，该算法能够较好地反演ACAOT550、AE440–670和SSA550等参数，并且与相邻的晴空气溶胶反演结果具有良好的一致性。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析，并可应用于空气质量监测。,"['above cloud aerosol', 'aerosol optical thickness', 'Angstrom Exponent', 'Single Scattering Albedo', 'multi-angular polarimetric measurements', 'satellite observations', 'PARASOL', 'neural networks', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition']",Zihao Yuan;Guangliang Fu;Hai Xiang Lin;Jan Willem Erisman;Otto P. Hasekamp,Above Cloud Aerosol Detection and Retrieval from Multi-Angular Polarimetric Satellite Measurements in a Neural Network Ensemble Approach,"This work develops an Neural-Network-based above cloud aerosol (ACA) detection and retrieval scheme for multi-angular polarimetric (MAP) instruments. On one year of the retrieval, the retrieved aerosol properties (aerosol optical thickness, AOT, Angstrom Exponent, AE, and Single Scattering Albedo, SSA) agree well with adjacent clear-sky aerosol retrievals. The seasonal global pattern of ACA events and above cloud AOT are also within expectation. 
 This paper describes an algorithm for above-cloud aerosol (ACA) retrievals from PARASOL (Polarisation and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar) Multi-Angle Polarimetric measurements. The algorithm, based on neural networks (NNs), has been trained on synthetic measurements and has been applied to the processing of one-year PARASOL data. The algorithm makes use of three subsequent NNs: (1) for the detection of liquid clouds, (2) for the retrieval of aerosol properties for ACA cases, and (3) an NN forward model to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the retrieval. The NN's theoretical capability of retrieval is investigated by several synthetic data studies. It is shown that the NNs retrieve ACAOT550 (above cloud aerosol optical thickness, at 550 nm), AE440–670 (Ångström exponent, between 440 and 670 nm), and SSA550 (single scattering albedo, at 550 nm) with an RMSE (root mean squared error) of ∼0.1 on ACAOT550, ∼0.4 on AE440–670 and ∼0.04 on SSA550 in synthetic experiments. Finally, comparison between the NN retrievals and adjacent PARASOL-RemoTAP clear-sky retrieval in 2008 shows good agreement within the range expected from the synthetic study."

Shupe;Damao Zhang,Classifying thermodynamic cloud phase using machine learning models,"This study leverages machine learning models to classify cloud thermodynamic phases using multi-sensor remote sensing data collected at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement North Slope of Alaska observatory. We evaluate model performance, feature importance, and application of the model to another observatory and quantify how the models respond to instrument outages. 
 Vertically resolved thermodynamic cloud-phase classifications are essential for studies of atmospheric cloud and precipitation processes. The Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Thermodynamic Cloud Phase (THERMOCLDPHASE) value-added product (VAP) uses a multi-sensor approach to classify the thermodynamic cloud phase by combining lidar backscatter and depolarization, radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectral width, microwave-radiometer-derived liquid water path, and radiosonde temperature measurements. The measured pixels are classified as ice, snow, mixed phase, liquid (cloud water), drizzle, rain, and liq_driz (liquid+drizzle). We use this product as the ground truth to train three machine learning (ML) models to predict the thermodynamic cloud phase from multi-sensor remote sensing measurements taken at the ARM North Slope of Alaska (NSA) observatory: a random forest (RF), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture. Evaluations against the outputs of the THERMOCLDPHASE VAP with 1 year of data show that the CNN outperforms the other two models, achieving the highest test accuracy, F1 score, and mean intersection over union (IOU). Analysis of ML confidence scores shows that ice, rain, and snow have higher confidence scores, followed by liquid, while mixed, drizzle, and liq_driz have lower scores. Feature importance analysis reveals that the mean Doppler velocity and vertically resolved temperature are the most influential data streams for ML thermodynamic cloud-phase predictions. Lidar measurements exhibit lower feature importance due to rapid signal attenuation caused by the frequent presence of persistent low-level clouds at the NSA site. The ML models' generalization capacity is further evaluated by applying them at another Arctic ARM site in Norway using data taken during the ARM Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) field campaign. The models demonstrated similar performance to that observed at the NSA site. Finally, we evaluate the ML models' response to simulated instrument outages and signal degradation and show that a CNN U-Net model trained with input channel dropouts performs better when input fields are missing."

Current global maps are too coarse for farming, flood, or fire applications. By combining multiple satellite data with ground observations and advanced models, we created accurate maps for every available observation date since 2016. These maps enable new opportunities for water management, agriculture, and environmental protection. 
 Satellite-driven soil moisture monitoring systems currently available fail to meet the spatial resolution requirement for a wide range of applications. This limitation is particularly critical for agricultural water management, assessing risks associated with extreme events, and hydrological modeling. This work aims to address the spatial limitations of satellite soil moisture remote sensing by developing GSSM-10, a global 10-meter resolution surface soil moisture dataset, using multi-sensor datasets integrated within an ensemble machine learning framework. These datasets encompass diverse data types—active microwave, multispectral, thermal infrared, and land elevation—offering a robust and comprehensive approach to estimating surface soil moisture (SSM). The ensemble model incorporates TabNet, Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The model was trained on ground-truth data collected from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The ensemble model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an R² of 0.8344, a bias of –0.0001, an RMSE of 0.0433 m³/m³, and an ubRMSE of 0.0433 m³/m³ in 5-fold cross-validation. When evaluated on a held-out test set, the model achieved similar levels of accuracy, with an R² of 0.8591, a bias of –0.0002 m³/m³, and an RMSE/ubRMSE of 0.0401 m³/m³. An interactive web platform has been developed for data access, visualization, and download, enabling broad adoption by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. By providing globally consistent, high-resolution SM estimates, GSSM-10 represents a significant advancement in satellite-based soil moisture monitoring for environmental and agricultural applications."

We rely on the known parameterizations, but our approach to solving the problem differs, allowing the algorithm to be incorporated into biogeochemical global ocean models with relative ease. New analytical and numerical solutions have confirmed that feedback between the degradation rate and sinking velocity significantly alters particulate matter fluxes. 
 Gravitational sinking of particulate organic matter (POM) is a key mechanism of the vertical transport of carbon in the deep ocean and its subsequent sequestration. The size spectrum of these particles is formed in the euphotic layer by primary production and various mechanisms, including food web consumption. The masses of the particles, as they descend, change under aggregation, fragmentation, and bacterial decomposition. These processes depend on the water temperature and oxygen concentration, particle sinking velocity, ages of the organic particles, ballasting and other factors. In this work, we developed a simple Eulerian–Lagrangian approach to solving equations for sinking particulate matter when the effects of the sizes and ages of the particles, temperature and oxygen concentration on their dynamics and degradation processes are considered. The model considers feedback between the degradation rate and the particle sinking velocity. We rely on known parameterizations, but our Eulerian–Lagrangian approach for solving the problem differs, which enables the algorithm to be incorporated into biogeochemical global ocean models with relative ease. Two novel analytical solutions of a system of one-dimensional Euler equations for the POM concentration and Lagrange equations for the particle mass and position were obtained for constant and age-dependent degradation rates. The feedback between the degradation rate and sinking velocity leads to significant differences in the vertical profiles of the POM concentration and sinking flux, in contrast to the solutions obtained at a constant sinking velocity, where the concentration and flux profiles of the POM are similar. The calculation results are compared with the available measurement data for the POM and POM flux for the latitude bands of 20–30° N in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and 50–60° S in the Southern Ocean. The dependence of the degradation rate on temperature significantly affected the profiles of the POM concentration and sinking flux by enhancing the degradation of sinking particles in the ocean's upper layer and suppressing it in the deep layer of the ocean. In all cases considered, the influence of the oxygen concentration was insignificant compared to that of the distribution of temperature with depth."

In net‐negative emission scenarios, where more CO2 is extracted from the atmosphere than emitted, we expect global cooling. Little is known about how the ocean will release heat and carbon under such a scenario. Here we use an Earth system model of intermediate complexity and show results of an idealized climate change scenario that, following global warming forced by an atmospheric CO2 increase of 1% per year until CO2 doubling, features subsequent sustained net‐negative emissions. After several hundred years of net‐negative emissions and gradual global cooling, abrupt discharge of heat from the ocean leads to a global mean surface temperature increase of several tenths of degrees that lasts for more than a century. This ocean heat “burp” originates from heat that has previously accumulated under global warming in the deep Southern Ocean, and emerges to the ocean surface via deep convection. Little CO2 is released along with the heat which is largely due to particularities of sea water carbon chemistry. As the ocean heat loss causes an atmospheric temperature increase independent of atmospheric CO2 concentrations or emissions, it presents a mechanism that introduces a breakdown of the quasi‐linear relationship of cumulative CO2 emissions and global surface warming, a metric that underpins political decision‐making. We call for assessing the robustness of how models forced with net‐negative CO2 emissions simulate durability of ocean storage of heat and CO2, and pathways of loss to the atmosphere."

These landscapes release large quantities of stored carbon into the atmosphere and threaten infrastructure. As thermokarst develops, freshly exposed permafrost enters the freeze‐thaw cycle, altering sediment properties. While freezing and thawing have been shown to reduce sediment strength and increase mobility, their effects under thermokarst conditions remain unexamined. To address this gap, we performed classical friction mechanics (slide‐hold‐slide and velocity stepping) experiments on fine‐grained sediments to examine the effects of a single freeze‐thaw cycle on the steady‐state and transient rheology under near‐surface pressures. Additionally, we applied Rate‐and‐State Friction laws to model transient localized deformation, revealing altered behavior in the rate‐dependent response and frictional healing potential following freeze‐thaw. Our results suggest that freeze‐thaw decreases the shear strength of fine‐grained sediments and increases mobilization potential in ways currently unaccounted for in future thermokarst development predictions and cold regions land surface hazards."

However, the carbon sink dynamics and mechanisms in this climate‐sensitive region remain uncertain. We applied a random forest algorithm on satellite data to reconstruct a 20‐year (2003–2022) record of spring‐summer CO2 flux in the Southern Ocean. Our findings revealed that the rate of CO2 uptake increase in the SIZ is nearly four times faster than that in the non‐SIZ, suggesting a notable poleward shift of Southern Ocean carbon sink. The accumulation of the SIZ carbon sink was attributed to enhanced phytoplankton growth during austral spring‐summer, driven by the positive trend of the Southern Annular Mode. These results deepen understanding of the intricate relationship between climate variability and regional carbon sink dynamics, offering valuable insights into future climate change impacts on polar carbon sinks."

The seasonal phytoplankton responses on these events were investigated using a coupled physical‐biogeochemical model. In fall and winter, light limitation and BFe dilution caused by deep mixing suppressed phytoplankton growth following such events. However, as the mixed layer shallowed in spring, BFe concentrations in the upper ocean increased sharply, triggering a rapid increase in diatom biomass. In contrast, summer exhibited no significant enhancement of diatom biomass due to mesozooplankton grazing pressure, while picoplankton instead dominated the phytoplankton increase. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for local physical and biological factors when projecting the impacts of atmospheric deposition on marine biogeochemical cycles under global climate change."

Three case studies show that CYGNSS‐derived inundation data capture evolution of floods, with increased inundation detected near flood locations 1 day after the event. A comprehensive analysis of 555 floods records in Sumatra identifies key parameters for a flood detection: an inundation anomaly threshold (0.1) and maximum distance between observations and a flood location (15 km). This approach could enhance flood risk assessment and forecasting, benefiting tropical populations.

As environmental forcing varies, lake surface temperature depart from equilibrium, with a time delay and reduced amplitude, depending on the ratio between the forcing period and the lake's thermal response time, and its dependency on lake/thermocline depth and wind speed.

This increase is driven primarily by a ML shoaling, and secondarily by a reduction of chlorophyll in summer. The latter exerts a pronounced impact on Qpen, resulting from higher sensitivity of Qpen to seasonal chlorophyll reduction in mid‐latitude oceans due to the shoaling of the summertime ML. Furthermore, the enhanced Qpen reduces the magnitude of SST tendency by 25.3% in summer, thereby weakening summertime month‐to‐month SST tendency in these regions.

The platform relies on in situ activation via borane coordination and exploits a copper catalytic redox system that generates amine-ligated boryl radicals, which undergo β-scission across the C(sp³)–N bond to release alkyl radicals. These intermediates engage in copper-catalyzed cross-couplings with a broad array of C-, N-, O-, and S-based nucleophiles.

 Photonic neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising approach toward energy-efficient artificial neural networks (ANN). Nanolasers, in particular, have become attractive candidates due to their ultra-low power consumption and intrinsic nonlinear characteristics. In this work, we propose a photonic neuromorphic computing architecture based on symmetry-protected robust zero modes at the center of the optical spectrum in coupled semiconductor nanolaser arrays. We experimentally demonstrate that even a small set of coupled nanolasers inherently provides non-convex classification capabilities, enabling it to solve non-trivial classification tasks. As a benchmark, we show that a 2 × 2 nanolaser array, acting as a hidden nonlinear layer with recurrent coupling is able to solve the XNOR logical gate. Our results further highlight the computation capabilities of such nanolaser array by showing robust classification performance even under challenging conditions, such as the classification of highly compressed handwritten digits with significantly overlapping feature boundaries. These findings suggest that symmetry or topologically protected modes in nanolaser arrays can leverage robust optical connections to tackle complex problems without the need of scaling up the number of neurons.

 Earth experienced state-specific climate-carbon cycle feedbacks during the Late Cenozoic Ice Age (LCIA). Whether similar feedbacks existed in the penultimate icehouse, the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA), remains uncertain. Here, we present phase relationships between eccentricity-paced climate cycles and carbonate carbon isotope across ~337–300 Ma. Up to 307 Ma, low-latitude continental carbon reservoirs expanded during eccentricity-forced coolings, resembling the Oligocene and Miocene climate-carbon cycle dynamics. After 307 Ma, this relationship reversed, analogous to the Plio-Pleistocene dynamics. We attribute this reversal to the increasing importance of high-latitude biome dynamics, comparable to what occurred at 6 Ma in the LCIA. Paralleling LPIA (335–301 Ma) and LCIA (past 34 Myr) records using this event reveals quasi-synchronization in the interaction of astronomical forcing, carbon cycling and glacial events from onset to apex of two icehouses. We propose that, despite different boundary conditions, extraterrestrial forcing shaped the evolutionary trajectory of Phanerozoic vegetated icehouses.

 While cap-dependent translation remains the primary focus in mRNA-based therapeutics, cap-independent translation holds promise for targeting diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. However, cap-independently translated mRNAs are unstable, produce less protein than capped mRNAs, and current methods for their improvement are imperfect.

 Cartilage-targeted gene therapy is promising for osteoarthritis (OA) treatment, though its potency critically depends on the effectiveness of delivery vectors.

To address the tradeoff between penetration and retention within articular cartilage, si-VPN-2 is further formulated into ROS-responsive nano-in-gel system, which turns out to alleviate cartilage degeneration in surgical ACTL mice, and further synergizes with methylprednisolone to implement superior joint protection in PTOA mice.

Here, the authors identify MD’s unique roles in arbitrating between different reinforcement learning strategies through prefrontal-striatal brain circuits. 
 Human decision-making involves model-free and model-based reinforcement learning (RL) strategies, largely implemented by prefrontal-striatal circuits. Combining human brain imaging with neural network modelling in a probabilistic reversal learning task, we identify a unique role for the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) in arbitrating between RL strategies. While both dorsal PFC and the striatum support rule switching, the former does so when subjects predominantly adopt model-based strategy, and the latter model-free. The lateral and medial subdivisions of MD likewise engage these modes, each with distinct PFC connectivity. Notably, prefrontal transthalamic processing increases during the shift from stable rule use to model-based updating, with model-free updates at intermediate levels. Our CogLinks model shows that model-free strategies emerge when prefrontal-thalamic mechanisms for context inference fail, resulting in a slower overwriting of prefrontal strategy representations - a phenomenon we empirically validate with fMRI decoding analysis. These findings reveal how prefrontal transthalamic pathways implement flexible RL-based cognition. The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is central to flexible decision-making.

 The escalating demand for long-term high-temperature microwave-absorbing materials (HTMAMs) in high-speed aerospace stealth is hindered by limitations such as magnetic loss degradation or oxidation risks. Herein, we introduce rare earth zirconate ceramics that exhibit air stability up to 1600 °C. Abundant oxygen vacancies significantly enhance permittivity and thus microwave-absorbing performance through activated thermionic migration at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the thermionic-facilitated permittivity can be meticulously modulated by electron delocalization, with the extent governed by lattice disorder. We demonstrate this concept through a dual-layer Er2Zr2O7/Gd2Zr2O7 structure to further optimize impedance matching, achieving an ultra-wide bandwidth (8.27 GHz) and strong absorption (−64.61 dB) at ultrathin thicknesses under 1.2 mm at 600 °C mainly by macroscopic interfacial resonance, alongside an ultralow thermal conductivity (1.61 W•m-1•K-1).

 Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is defined by the expansion of a lineage of genetically identical cells in blood. Genetic lesions that confer a fitness advantage, such as leukemogenic point mutations or mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs), are frequent mediators of CH. However, recent analyses of both single cell-derived colonies of hematopoietic cells and population sequencing cohorts have revealed CH frequently occurs in the absence of known driver genetic lesions. To characterize CH without known driver genetic lesions, we use 51,399 deeply sequenced whole genomes from the NHLBI TOPMed sequencing initiative to perform simultaneous germline and somatic mutation analyses among individuals without leukemogenic point mutations (LPM), which we term CH-LPMneg. We quantify CH by estimating the total mutation burden. Because estimating somatic mutation burden without a paired-tissue sample is challenging, we develop a novel statistical method, the Genomic and Epigenomic informed Mutation (GEM) rate, that uses external genomic and epigenomic data sources to distinguish artifactual signals from true somatic mutations. We perform a genome-wide association study of GEM to discover the germline determinants of CH-LPMneg. We identify seven genes associated with CH-LPMneg (TCL1A, TERT, SMC4, NRIP1, PRDM16, MSRA, SCARB1).Functional analyses of SMC4 and NRIP1 implicated altered hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and proliferation as the primary mediator of mutation burden in blood. We then perform comprehensive multi-tissue transcriptomic analyses, finding that the expression levels of 404 genes are associated with GEM. Finally, we perform phenotypic association meta-analyses across four cohorts, finding that GEM is associated with increased white blood cell count, but is not significantly associated with incident stroke or coronary disease events. Overall, we develop GEM for quantifying mutation burden from WGS and use GEM to discover the genetic, genomic, and phenotypic correlates of CH-LPMneg.

 Prevailing strategies for commuting efficiency focus predominantly on land-use and transportation policies, whereas research on the environmental benefits of housing reallocation strategies to mitigate excess commuting remains critically underexplored. Here this study proposes an information-enabled housing exchange framework and quantifies the potential reduction of commuting-related carbon emissions it can achieve. Leveraging housing and travel survey data from Beijing (n = 2,032), Munich (n = 3,131) and Singapore (n = 7,418), at the household level, our analysis reveals that commuting distances could be reduced by approximately 10.49%–12.70%, corresponding to CO2 emissions reductions of 11.33%, 12.09% and 13.42%, respectively. Crucially, strategic relocation of the households with the 5% highest carbon reduction potential could yield more than 50% of total achievable emissions reduction. These results demonstrate that enhancing housing market efficiency through information transparency can generate substantial environmental co-benefits. The integration of conventional policies with this approach would enable a viable pathway to sustainable urban development. Little is known about the environmental benefits of housing reallocation.

 Karst vegetation ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change. However, relative to the other vegetation ecosystems, the adaptability of the vulnerable vegetation in the karst ecosystem to drought events remains unclear, especially in quantifying the contribution of different factors, including forest age, canopy height, terrain slope, precipitation, and human population. Here, we developed an evaluation framework based on a vegetation response intensity (RI), which includes drought stress windows and delayed vegetation response windows to detect vegetation adaptability to drought stress. Results show that the vegetation adaptability in global karst areas shows an increasing trend (-0.06 yr-1, p < 0.01), but shows significant differences. Although vegetation in all karst regions shows weak adaptability to short-term sudden droughts, vegetation adaptability in Europe (RI = 0.05) and North America (RI = 0.10) is significantly stronger than that in southwest China (RI = 0.23) for long-term drought. Notably, although the ecological restoration process can rapidly increase greenery in sensitive and fragile karst areas, the artificially restored vegetation with a lower age lacks adaptability to drought events in the short term. The adaptability of vegetation in karst areas to drought is mainly influenced by forest age (improved: 16.67%), slope (degraded: 18.87%), precipitation (degraded: 32.27%), and population (degraded: 31.22%) disturbance.

 Satellite lidar plays a unique role in observing the global vertical distribution of aerosols and clouds. CALIPSO (Apr 2006–Aug 2023) pioneered such observations, and China's Aerosol and Carbon Detection Lidar (ACDL) on board the DQ-1 satellite (Apr 2022-) continues this mission. Consequently, it is crucial to develop aerosol and cloud products of ACDL. Particularly, detecting the vertical and horizontal extent of aerosol and cloud layers is one of the most challenging tasks. In this study, we developed an ACDL layer detection algorithm based on the Two-Dimensional Multiscale Hypothesis Testing (2D-MHT) methodology. Notably, we proposed an approach for the uncertainty estimation in lidar return signals from the background atmosphere, enabling successful layer detection for ACDL. The results demonstrate that our algorithm not only accurately identifies layers within ACDL measurements, but also provides the probability that a specific signal bin belongs to a layer. This probability enables users to customize layer definitions, a feature not available in other lidar products that typically rely on threshold-based methods. Furthermore, the ACDL layer products offer higher horizontal resolution and detect 53.0 % more layers globally compared to the CALIPSO V4.51 merged layer product in June 2022. These findings underscore the significant potential of our algorithm and ACDL layer products for advancing atmospheric and climate research."

 Investigating semantic change detection (SCD) is critical for tracking the evolution of urban and rural conversion. However, existing methods applied to SCD face two pivotal challenges: (1) modeling of semantic correlations among bi-temporal features is insufficient, leading to substantial pseudo-changes induced by seasonal and temporal differences; and (2) change information lacks effective enhancement, causing incomplete and missed detection. To overcome these challenges, we propose a change prior-guided network, namely CPGNet, which employs a multi-branch paradigm that integrates supplemental changed information to accurately identify diverse types of land cover changes in very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. Initially, a Siamese network is introduced to simultaneously extract robust semantic representations from bi-temporal images. Next, a semantic correlation module is designed to capture and process the interconnections present in bi-temporal features, thereby alleviating pseudo-changes resulting from season variance and time disparities. We then incorporate an auxiliary CD branch to capture changed prior information. Finally, a multi-view change feature fusion module based on Bayesian theory is developed to enhance salient changed features to improve the under-detection of changed areas, particularly for changed objects with small sizes and complex shapes. We applied the proposed method to the semantic change detection dataset (SECOND), JiLin-1 (JL-1) dataset, and Xiamen (XM) dataset, and compared the results to ten typical SCD methods.

 To address biodiversity loss and restore ecosystem services, it is important to monitor ecosystem degradation and recovery. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) provide high-resolution data for site-specific monitoring. During degradation or recovery in peatlands, vegetation composition is a crucial indicator of ecosystem condition. In this study, UAS multispectral images, vegetation indices, and digital surface models (DSM) were used to classify peatland vegetation and land cover types. The classes included hummock and lawn Sphagnum, cottongrass Eriophorum vaginatum, evergreen dwarf shrubs, bare peat and water. Previous research has focused on categorizing peatland vegetation, with Random Forest (RF) being the most widely used machine learning algorithms. This study aims to evaluate the classification performance of different ensemble machine learning algorithms, including RF, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). Classifications were performed using both default and optimized hyperparameters. Optuna was applied to improve classifier performance by systematically exploring a wide range of hyperparameter values. Additionally, Shapley Additive Expansions (SHAP) feature importance was utilized to improve the explainability of the classification algorithms and pinpoint the critical features that drive classification outcomes. The results indicate that hyperparameter optimization improved overall accuracy from 81 to 86% (default) to 86–87% (optimized). Despite their similar performance, RF showed better differentiation of lawn Sphagnum with both default and optimized hyperparameter settings, while CatBoost had the better accuracies to characterize Eriophorum vaginatum tussocks and hummock Sphagnum. DSM and Red edge were found to be the influential features according to the SHAP results. These findings emphasize the value of hyperparameter optimization and feature importance analysis in improving classification accuracy and feature interpretability for peatland vegetation classes."

 Tree branch angles and their distributions (BADs) are key structural traits influencing light interception, resource allocation, and canopy architecture. However, measuring them accurately remains challenging. We present BASeg, a novel method based on instance segmentation to automatically quantify branch angles and BADs from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data. BASeg segments individual branches using Voronoi partitioning, fits branch diameters via non-linear least squares, downsamples branch point clouds of varying diameter to different resolutions, and skeletonizes branches using the Laplacian algorithm. Branch angles are then calculated through a cluster-based nearest neighbor graph. We validated BASeg using leaf-off TLS data from six sycamore trees and using simulated data from nine trees (aspen, birch, and maple), spanning various sizes. Additionally, we evaluated its sensitivity to TLS scanning protocols—scanning angular resolution, scanning distance between different locations, and number of scan positions—using 107 field-measured angles from two large beech trees. BASeg achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.96° (14.64 %) and a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.89 for branch angle estimation. For estimating BADs, BASeg achieved mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 2.2 to 381.1 (25.2 % to 69.3 %), outperforming TreeQSM, Laplacian, TreeGraph, L1-tree, and WOODSKE. Neither scanning distance (10–20 m) nor the number of scan positions (3–6) affected the accuracy of branch angles or BADs traits, while scanning angular resolution (0.01°–0.04°) did impact these traits.

 Observed winter fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations in Bangladesh tend to be high with monthly mean concentrations ranging between 182 and 229 μg m−3. To evaluate the model skill in reproducing the high observed concentrations, we apply the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQv5.4) model and compare model predicted PM2.5 concentrations with observed data in Bangladesh in January 2019. We use anthropogenic emissions estimates from the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (version 3) mosaic inventory, supplementing them with brick kiln emissions estimates over Bangladesh, and replacing them with emissions from the Speciated MultipOllutant Generator for India. The model reproduces monthly mean observed PM2.5 concentrations to within −27 % to −2 % in Bangladesh and successfully tracks the day-to-day and diurnal variation of observed PM2.5 concentrations. Both model and observed data show higher night-time PM2.5 concentrations than daytime concentrations due to shallow boundary layers, lower temperature, lower wind speed, and higher relative humidity at night. We find brick kiln emissions contribute monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations of 31–46 μg m−3 (18–27 %) in Bangladesh. A substantial portion of the contribution of brick kiln emissions to PM2.5 concentrations originate from secondary organic aerosols due to the large amount of volatile organic compounds emissions.

 Emissions from biomass burning (BB) and diesel combustion significantly impact air quality, health and climate by releasing pollutants. However, due to variability in combustion sources and efficiency, and emission aging, their aerosol's composition and optical properties remain poorly understood and underrepresented in climate and air quality models. This study investigated the chemical and physical properties of BB aerosol emissions using advanced instrumentation in the EUPHORE simulation chamber. Emissions from different wood types (including mixtures with diesel exhaust) were analyzed, considering flaming and smoldering combustion, and their evolution under day and night conditions.Results indicated that combustion phase had a greater influence on emissions than wood type. Flaming combustion and diesel exhaust produced similar elemental carbon (EC) emissions (0.55 g/kg fuel and 0.46–0.73 g/kg fuel, respectively) while smoldering yielded lower EC (0.1–0.37 g/kg fuel) and higher organic carbon (OC), leading to higher OC/EC ratios (53 ± 20 g/kg fuel) than flaming and diesel fumes (1.5 ± 0.8 and 0.6 ± 0.1 g/kg fuel, respectively). Smoldering emissions contained more complex, higher molecular weight organics, with more harmful effects than flaming. Daytime aging promoted formation of highly-oxidized organic compounds, while nighttime aging, driven by nitrate radicals, formed nitro-aromatic compounds, associated with genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Both aging processes also increased aerosol absorption and scattering, affecting climate-relevant properties.This study provides one of the most comprehensive chamber-based analyses of BB and diesel-related emissions and their atmospheric evolution, integrating aerosol chemical composition and optical properties. The results contribute to understanding the impact of BB on air quality, health and climate, enhancing models and informing effective mitigation strategies."

 The lifting condensation level (LCL) is a key parameter in estimating the convective cloud base height (CBH) and plays a crucial role in various meteorological processes. Under typical atmospheric conditions, the CBH coincides with or is positioned above the LCL. This study investigates the occurrence of clouds forming below the LCL over Ahmedabad, a semi-arid region in Western India, during 2022–2024. An analytical LCL formulation, derived from surface temperature and relative humidity, showed minimal bias compared to established empirical formulas when validated against radiosonde data. Convective clouds near the LCL are most frequent during the monsoon season. However, during the post-monsoon and winter months, anomalous cloud formations below the LCL were observed, with a mean CBH of 1044 ± 135 m, predominantly between 0600 and 1200 UTC. These low-level clouds were associated with a strong thermal inversion below the LCL, occurring under surface temperatures ranging from 24 °C to 37 °C and relative humidity levels between 17 % and 49 %. The surface sensible heat flux during these clouds' occurrence was lower than that observed for clouds forming near the LCL but comparable to clear-sky conditions. Conversely, the surface latent heat flux was higher than in clear-sky conditions but lower than in cases where clouds formed near the LCL, averaging 147 ± 74 W/m2. These findings highlight the role of thermodynamic stability and surface heat fluxes in modulating cloud formation processes in semi-arid environments. Improved understanding of clouds forming below the LCL is essential for enhancing weather prediction models and refining convective parameterization schemes in numerical weather and climate models, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions where cloud development significantly influences regional climate variability."

 This study evaluates how well five Regional Climate Model (RCM) projections at resolutions from 44 km to 3 km reproduce wet and dry spells compared with observations at six locations in Scania, southern Sweden. Future changes in general and extreme wet and dry signals were also analyzed under RCP8.5 to the end of the 21st century. Convection-permitting climate models (CPMs), operating at resolutions fine enough to explicitly resolve convective processes (< 4 km), are widely recognized to simulate precipitation characteristics more accurately than coarser models. Our results confirm that CPM AROME (3 km), outperforms coarser RCMs in representing both wet and dry spells. Future projections across all resolutions indicate increases in wet spells to the end of the century, with average daily precipitation increasing by 8–12 %. The number of wet events, their average depth, and duration also projected to increase to varying degrees. For dry spells, the annual number of dry days shows a slight increase (0–3 %). The number of dry events is projected to decrease while both the average duration and the annual maximum consecutive dry days increase. Extreme value analysis shows that extreme precipitation intensities at various accumulating durations increase over 5- to 50-year return periods, as implied by the Wet Climate Factor (WCF). The Dry Climate Factor (DCF) indicates shorter annual maximum consecutive dry days in the near future, but prolonged at the end of the century by 3–9 %. These findings corroborate with previous research and improve understanding of systematic biases across RCMs resolutions. They further suggest that CPMs offer improved reliability in projecting future variability in wet and dry conditions, with important implications for regional climate services."

 In recent years, global warming and its associated problems have garnered widespread attention from the international community. The Earth's three pole regions are among the most sensitive areas to global climate change, experiencing warming rates that significantly exceed the global average, a phenomenon known as polar amplification. However, the academic community has yet to reach a consensus on the possible mechanisms behind polar amplification, and research that links the three pole regions together remains relatively scarce. To gain a systematic understanding of the long-term variability in the radiation and energy budgets of the three pole regions, we utilized satellite observation, reanalysis, and model simulation data products to examine the interannual, seasonal, and spatiotemporal variations in several radiation components of these regions from 2001 to 2023. Subsequently, the radiative kernel method was employed to partition the total radiation budget variations over the three pole regions into partial contributions from surface albedo, water vapor, clouds, air temperature, and surface temperature, thereby explaining the causes of radiation budget anomalies in these regions. The results reveal that the surface shortwave downward radiation in the Earth's three pole regions has undergone a remarkable long-term decreasing trend. In contrast, the longwave downward radiation has shown a consistent long-term increase. Moreover, the shortwave net radiation, longwave net radiation, and total net radiation in the Arctic and Antarctic regions all exhibit long-term increasing trends to varying degrees, whereas the opposite is true for the Tibetan Plateau. By combining radiative kernel analysis with multivariate regression, we found that a substantial part of the changes in the shortwave radiation budgets in the three pole regions can be attributed to variations in surface albedo. Conversely, the variability in the longwave radiation budgets is closely associated with changes in cloud cover, surface temperature, and air temperature, and it also displays similar seasonal variation characteristics to these variables."

 Design precipitation estimates are crucial for hydrological modeling, flood risk assessment, and infrastructure planning. Traditional methods rely either on relatively sparse rain-gauge data or on areal but less reliable radar-derived precipitation data. We propose an innovative approach to improving the estimates by merging two design precipitation fields: (i) from adjusted high-resolution radar-derived intensities and (ii) from long-term ombrographic measurements. The proposed approach is demonstrated through application to Czechia on 1-h, 6-h, and 24-h design precipitation totals. Leave-one-out cross-validation identifies Empirical Bayesian Kriging of the ratios between ombrograph- and adjusted radar-derived design totals as the most effective merging method. The combined estimates offer enhanced spatial accuracy, better reflecting real spatial gradients of extreme precipitation. The resulting design precipitation fields reflect substantial spatial variability at shorter durations due to convective precipitation, whereas the highest 24-h design totals are concentrated in mountainous regions, consistent with large-scale circulation patterns driving prolonged stratiform rainfall. A comparison with previously developed datasets confirms the reliability of the new estimates, emphasizing the relevance of radar adjustments and regional frequency analysis. Moreover, the merging procedure increases underestimated radar-based short-term design totals, which highlights a key advantage of the proposed approach. The enhanced spatial resolution and reliability of the resulting design precipitation estimates enable more robust flood risk management, infrastructure design, and adaptation planning, particularly in this region with such diverse precipitation regimes."

 Using the Self-Organizing Map method, tornadoes associated with the Northeast China cold vortex (NCCV) are classified into three categories, each predominantly distributed in different regions. Tornadoes in Cluster 1 (C1) primarily occur in Northeast China, while those in Cluster 2 (C2) are concentrated from North China to northern Jiangnan. This study investigates characteristics of C1 and C2 tornadoes under the NCCV and its influences. Results indicate during the warm seasons from 2007 to 2020, the frequencies of C1 and C2 tornadoes exhibit declining trends regardless of NCCV presence. The NCCV induces weaker positive convective available potential energy (CAPE) anomalies and lower negative lifting condensation level (LCL) anomalies, especially for C1 tornadoes. That is, the CAPE threshold is more readily reached for C1 tornadoes when the NCCV occurs. Meanwhile, low-level moisture anomalies are not essential for either tornado type under the NCCV. When vertical wind shear or storm-relative helicity is unfavorable under the NCCV, negative LCL anomalies become crucial for C1 tornadoes, while positive CAPE and negative LCL anomalies favor C2 tornadoes. Further analysis reveals NCCV-related positive potential vorticity anomalies trigger cyclonic circulation anomalies, enhancing C1 tornado occurrence. Cyclonic circulation anomalies associated with the NCCV converge with anticyclonic circulation anomalies near southern China, promoting C2 tornado occurrence. Dry intrusions are crucial for C2 tornadoes. Compared to C1 tornadoes under the non-NCCV, those under the NCCV exhibit stronger low-level convergence, upper-level divergence, and mid−low-level ascending motion anomalies, indicating stronger dynamic forcing. Conversely, C2 tornadoes under the NCCV have more accessible threshold for dynamic conditions."

 Hail forms within deep convective storms through the nucleation of ice particles, the accretion of supercooled water droplets, and repeated growth cycles sustained by strong updrafts, with its occurrence producing widespread impacts on agriculture, transportation, aviation, and critical infrastructure. Understanding the structure of hailstones and the nature of embedded insoluble particles, particularly in the hail embryo, is crucial for revealing hail formation mechanisms and ice nucleation pathways. This study analyzes a large, plate-shaped hailstone collected in Yantai, Shandong Province on October 1, 2021. Hail slicing reveals a layered structure composed of five opaque and four transparent layers, indicating multiple cycles of dry and wet growth in a supercooled water-rich environment. The hail embryo, typically less than 5 mm in diameter, contains abundant insoluble particles. Single-particle analysis using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) shows that the embryo primarily contains mineral dust and bioprotein aerosols. Notably, pollen-like particles are identified, likely linked to the autumn sampling season. To further characterize the particle population, statistical analysis of 8375 insoluble particles is performed using k-means clustering based on elemental composition. Four major types are identified: mineral, bioprotein, organic, and mixed. Mineral and mixed particles exhibit larger sizes and more compact shapes, while bioprotein and organic particles are smaller and more irregular. The backward trajectory analysis indicates that insoluble particles may originate from both long-range transport, especially dust carried from arid regions of northwest China, and from local emission sources. The combined morphological and compositional findings improve understanding of hail microphysics and offer valuable insight for hail forecasting, disaster mitigation, and climate research."

 The prediction of tropical cyclones (TCs) on a subseasonal scale is crucial for advancing scientific understanding and improving risk mitigation strategies. However, the sub-seasonal forecasting of TCs continues to pose significant challenges. This study analyzes TC forecasts at one to eight weeks lead, using the dynamic sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction system developed by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP-CAS). The IAP-CAS model captures the spatiotemporal pattern, landfalling TC, and translation speed climatology. Currently, the model is skillful in capturing the annual cycle accurately across most basins and lead weeks. But, skillful only in the Northwest Pacific during the first week to predict the TCs anomalies deviation from the seasonal cycle. However, there is a potential room for improvement in skill over most of the basins and lead weeks. The skill can be further enhanced significantly with a lag-ensemble and post-processing calibration technique. The interannual variations of accumulated cyclone energy is skillfully predicted across Northern Hemisphere basins, except the North Indian Ocean. The model also captures the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) influence on TC, with an eastward propagation of enhanced genesis up to 3rd week. Furthermore, the model demonstrates enhanced proficiency when the combined impact of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-MJO TC relationship is effectively resolved. The biases in the dynamic genesis potential index (DGPI) effectively explain the biases of TCs forecast error across most basins and lead times. These findings provide valuable insight for model improvement and advancement on the sub-seasonal scale."
