10.5194/acp-25-1-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了春季北极地区黑碳沉积对降雪变暗效应的数值敏感性。研究者将SNICAR模型与Polar-WRF模型相结合，模拟了不同黑碳沉积量对地表能量平衡的影响。结果表明，黑碳沉积会降低积雪反照率，增加辐射强迫，尤其是在格陵兰岛、巴芬岛和西伯利亚东部地区。积雪深度对黑碳的影响有显著的线性关系，深厚的积雪区受影响更大。此外，融雪和陆气相互作用也至关重要。离线模拟（无地表反馈）高估了降雪变暗效应的影响，这突出了高分辨率模型中包含详细物理过程的重要性，以更好地理解降雪变暗效应在北极气候变化中的作用。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为黑碳是大气成分分析中的重要污染物，而卫星观测和空气质量监测可以提供黑碳浓度和分布的数据，从而用于验证和改进模型，提高对北极气候变化的预测精度。,"['Black carbon', 'Aerosol', 'Snow albedo', 'Radiative forcing', 'Arctic climate change', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air quality monitoring']",Zilu Zhang;Libo Zhou;Meigen Zhang,A numerical sensitivity study on the  snow-darkening effect by black carbon  deposition over the Arctic in spring,"By integrating the SNICAR model with Polar-WRF, we find that 50 ng g−1 black carbon (BC) deposition decreases snow albedo, increasing radiative forcing (RF) by 1–4 W m−2, especially in Greenland, Baffin Island, and eastern Siberia. The impact is strongly linked to BC mass, with deep snowpacks showing greater sensitivity. Snowmelt and land–atmosphere interactions are crucial. High-resolution modelling is necessary to better understand these effects on Arctic climate change. 
 The rapid warming of the Arctic, driven by glacial and sea ice melt, poses significant challenges to Earth's climate, ecosystems, and economy. Recent evidence indicates that the snow-darkening effect (SDE), caused by black carbon (BC) deposition, plays a crucial role in accelerated warming. However, high-resolution simulations assessing the impacts from the properties of snowpack and land–atmosphere interactions on the changes in the surface energy balance of the Arctic caused by BC remain scarce. This study integrates the Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model with a polar-optimized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (Polar-WRF) to evaluate the impacts of snow melting and land–atmosphere interaction processes on the SDE due to BC deposition. The simulation results indicate that BC deposition can directly affect the surface energy balance by decreasing snow albedo and its corresponding radiative forcing (RF). On average, BC deposition at 50 ng g−1 causes a daily average RF of 1.6 W m−2 in offline simulations (without surface feedbacks) and 1.4 W m−2 in online simulations (with surface feedback). The reduction in snow albedo induced by BC is strongly dependent on snow depth, with a significant linear relationship observed when snow depth is shallow. In regions with deep snowpack, such as Greenland, BC deposition leads to a 25 %–41 % greater SDE impact and a 19 %–40 % increase in snowmelt compared to in areas with shallow snow. Snowmelt and land–atmosphere interactions play significant roles in assessing changes in the surface energy balance caused by BC deposition based on a comparison of results from offline and online coupled simulations via Polar-WRF and the community Noah land surface model (LSM) with multiple parameterization options (Noah-MP) and SNICAR. Offline simulations tend to overestimate SDE impacts by more than 50 % because crucial surface feedback processes are excluded. This study underscores the importance of incorporating detailed physical processes in high-resolution models to improve our understanding of the role of the SDE in Arctic climate change."

This paper intercompares three satellite HCHO retrievals and validates them against in situ observations from the NASA ATom mission.

 Formaldehyde (HCHO) in the atmosphere is an intermediate product from the oxidation of methane and non-methane volatile organic compounds. In remote marine regions, HCHO variability is closely related to atmospheric oxidation capacity, and modeled HCHO in these regions is usually added as a global satellite HCHO background. Thus, it is important to understand and validate the levels of satellite HCHO over the remote oceans. Here we intercompare three satellite retrievals of total HCHO columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (OMI SAO (v004)) algorithm, Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite on Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (OMPS-NPP SAO) algorithm, and Ozone Monitoring Instrument Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (OMI BIRA) algorithm and validate them against in situ observations from the NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) mission. All retrievals are correlated with ATom-integrated columns over remote oceans, with OMI SAO (v004) showing the best agreement. This is also reflected in the mean bias (MB) for OMI SAO (−0.73 ± 0.87) × 1015 molec. cm−2, OMPS SAO (−0.76 ± 0.88) × 1015 molec. cm−2, and OMI BIRA (−1.40 ± 1.11) × 1015 molec. cm−2. We recommend the OMI-SAO (v004) retrieval for remote-ocean atmosphere studies. Three satellite HCHO retrievals and in situ ATom columns all generally captured the spatial and seasonal distributions of HCHO in the remote-ocean atmosphere. Retrieval bias varies by latitude and season, but a persistent low bias is found in all products at high latitudes, and the general low bias is most severe for the OMI BIRA product. Examination of retrieval components reveals that slant column corrections have a larger impact on the retrievals over remote marine regions, while AMFs play a smaller role. This study informs us that the potential latitude-dependent biases in the retrievals require further investigation for improvement and should be considered when using marine HCHO satellite data, and vertical profiles from in situ instruments are crucial for validating satellite retrievals."

 The chemical properties of aerosols in the atmosphere significantly influence their impact on the global climate forcing and human health. However, a real-time molecular-level characterisation of aerosols remains challenging due to the complex nature of their chemical composition. The current study constructed an instrumental system for the real-time chemical characterisation of aerosol particles. The proposed setup consists of a custom-built high-efficiency aerosol collector (HEAC) used to collect aerosol samples into a working fluid and an electrospray ionisation (ESI) Orbitrap Mass spectrometer (MS) for the subsequent chemical analysis of the liquid sample. The HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS was calibrated against six chemical compounds to investigate the system’s sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD). Results showed that the coupled system has high sensitivities towards the tested chemical compounds and a similar, if not better, LOD than other related instrumental techniques. The capability of the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system to identify the chemical composition of organic aerosols (OA) was also examined. Sample OA was generated by α-pinene ozonolysis, and the chemical characterisation results were compared to similar studies. Our data showed that the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system can identify most of the α-pinene ozonolysis products reported in the literature, including cis-pinonic acid, pinalic acid and 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA). Monomeric and dimeric reaction products were accurately identified in the mass spectra, even at a total OA mass concentration < 2 µg m-3. The present study showed that the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system is a robust technique for the real-time chemical characterisation of OA particles under atmospheric relevant conditions."

 Data drives our understanding of hydrological processes, supports model development, and enables anticipatory water management. This contribution introduces EARLS: European Aggregated Reconstructions for Large-sample Studies. EARLS offers daily streamflow reconstructions for more than 10,000 basins in Europe including uncertainty estimates, covering the period from 1953 to 2023. The reconstruction is derived from a single Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based rainfall–runoff model trained on more than 5,000 basins. LSTMs represent the state of the art in rainfall–runoff modeling and are well suited to provide predictions in ungauged basins. We evaluate the quality of the reconstruction through quantitative evaluation on two held-out sets of basins and by conducting a qualitative assessment that compares EARLS-based peak flows and flood timing to previous large-scale hydrological studies. EARLS represents a new generation of datasets that harness the capabilities of Deep Learning to obtain accurate and high-resolution data.

10.5194/gmd-2024-203,False,Geoscientific Model Development Discussions,这篇论文研究的是北极海冰对气候变化的响应，开发了一个简单的海冰模拟器来模拟海冰对全球变暖的反应。研究发现，避免北极海域全年无冰所需的剩余二氧化碳排放量低于之前的估计值。该模型还提供了对未来冬季海冰的见解，其计算成本远低于复杂的全耦合气候模式。虽然研究中可能用到卫星观测数据来验证模型，但其核心并非大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，而是利用简化模型研究气候变化对北极海冰的影响。因此，与大气环境遥感技术的相关性较弱。,"['Arctic sea ice', 'climate change', 'CO2 emissions', 'climate models', 'Global warming', 'satellite observations']",Sian Megan Chilcott;Malte Meinshausen,The Development and Application of an Arctic Sea Ice Emulator v.1,"Climate models are expensive to run and often underestimate how sensitive Arctic sea ice is to climate change. To address this, we developed a simple model that emulates the response of sea ice to global warming. We find the remaining carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that will avoid a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean is lower than previous estimates of 821 Gigatonnes of CO2. Our model also provides insights into the future of winter sea ice, examining a larger ensemble than previously possible. 
 The high computational expense of complex climate models and their tendency to underestimate observational records of Arctic sea ice sensitivity to anthropogenic forcers, challenge our ability to assess the magnitude of forcing that will cause Arctic sea ice loss to cross critical thresholds. To address these limitations, we development an Arctic sea ice emulator, that is calibrated to the response of sea ice area to global warming in physically-based CMIP6 models and constrained to observations. Our constrained emulator reduces the remaining budget of CO2 that can be emitted to prevent seasonally ice-free conditions from 821 GtCO2 by CMIP6 multi-model ensemble estimates to 380 GtCO2. This suggests that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C is sufficient to prevent a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, whereas 2 °C proves insufficient. Our results also provide insight into the future of winter sea ice over a greater ensemble range than previously possible, pinpointing the emission threshold at which the ice pack detaches from land, after which the ice pack rapidly disappears to year-round ice free conditions."

CIPP involves the manufacture of a new plastic pipe inside a buried damaged pipe. In this study, the chemical composition of the raw materials and CIPP water quality impacts were examined. Numerous (47) VOCs and SVOCs were found in the resin and two hardeners were studied. TGA results indicated that new CIPPs contained about 3.2–4.8 wt% VOC. A controlled static headspace analysis using PTR-TOF-MS detected eight protonated ions (m/z < 114) with mixing ratios above 1 ppb and phenol was identified as the most abundant VOC released into air. The analytical methods were unable to identify 99.9% of the extractable VOC mass. A 5% shorter curing duration had no impact on the chemical residual left in the CIPPs, but a 5% hardener reduction prompted an increase in the amount of monomer remaining. Both normal drying and quick drying formulations released similar amounts of 2-EHGE and BPA into drinking water. Laboratory results scaled to 4–36 in. diameter pipes indicated only 4 in. diameter CIPPs would cause BPA levels to exceed a U.S. state drinking water standard, EU, and WHO drinking water limits.

Globally increased fires altered peat soil organic matter chemistry, yet the redox property and molecular dynamics of peat-dissolved organic matter (PDOM) during fires remain poorly characterized, limiting our understanding of postfire biogeochemical processes. Clarifying these dynamic changes is essential for effective peatland fire management. This study demonstrates temperature-dependent dynamic changes in the electron exchange capacity (EEC) of PDOM by simulating peat soil burning, significantly affecting microbial iron reduction. At low fire temperatures (200–250 °C), the EEC remains constant by releasing more phenolic moieties to enhance the electron-donating capacity (EDC). Higher temperatures (500 °C) diminish 90% of the EEC by consuming phenolic–quinone moieties. Pyrolytic PDOM (pyPDOM) contributes to 40% of the EEC of peat soil, with this contribution declining at higher temperatures. Phenolic–quinone moieties remain the primary redox-active moieties in pyPDOM. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analysis shows that postfire EDC depends more on phenolic types than abundance, with monophenol-like molecules (C < 12) being more significant than polyphenol-like (C ≥ 12). Quinone moieties in pyPDOM are associated with high-oxygen condensed aromatics, and their depletion reduces the electron-accepting capacity, weakening its electron shuttle effect in microbial iron reduction. Our findings enhance the understanding of the changes in PDOM redox properties during fires."

As exposure is demonstrated to cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain largely unknown.

The results showed that exposure to As caused lipid accumulation and upregulated the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes Fabp1, Srebf1, and Apoc3, while downregulated Acox1 and Cpt1a in rat liver. In addition, it was found that inorganic arsenite (iAsIII) was methylated to DMA, and the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) level was decreased, which would contribute to the repression of H3K9me1/2 in rat liver after exposure. The in vitro studies revealed that SAM supplementation attenuated lipid accumulation by restoring H3K9me1/2 in HepG2 cells, which further confirmed our animal results. Therefore, it is suggested that As methylation depleted SAM, which inhibited H3K9me1/2 and activated Fabp1, Srebf1, and Apoc3 expressions, leading to NAFLD upon inorganic As exposure.

The framework assigns 16 different labels (classes) to each LPS data point and designates four different types of high‐impact LPS tracks, including tracks of tropical cyclone (TC), monsoonal system, subtropical storm and polar low. The classification process involves disentangling high‐altitude and drier LPSs, differentiating tropical and non‐tropical LPSs using novel criteria, and optimizing for the detection of the four types of high‐impact LPS. A comparison of our labels with those in the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) revealed an overall accuracy of 95% in distinguishing between tropical systems, extratropical cyclones, and disturbances.

Martin Ralph,A Case Study of an Exceptional Atmospheric River and Explosively Deepening Cyclone Over the US Central Plains in March 2019,"In March 2019, a strong atmospheric river (AR) originating from the Gulf of Mexico transported abundant moisture inland and fueled a record‐breaking bomb cyclone in Colorado, resulting in widespread winter weather hazards across several states. Experimental model simulations and trajectory analysis indicate that mid‐tropospheric latent heat release (LHR) coincided with the strength of the warm conveyor belt and played a key role in the deepening of the cyclone. The LHR promoted the generation of a lower tropospheric positive potential vorticity (PV) anomaly and a stronger low‐level cyclonic circulation, enhancing the cyclone, low‐level jet stream, and associated water vapor transport. Additionally, it generated an upper tropospheric negative PV anomaly and strong upper‐level anticyclonic circulation, influencing the structure of the trough‐ridge couplet and the associated Rossby wave. Reductions in the initial intensity of the AR and disallowing LHR both weakened the cyclone. However, disallowing LHR significantly disturbed the synoptic‐scale structure of the storm and embedded Rossby wave, resulting in a stronger impact. Thus, the reduction of diabatic PV generation, under the influence of AR activities, was crucial in the explosive intensification of the cyclone. Additionally, the reductions in AR intensity and the magnitude of cyclone weakening did not show a linear relationship. Few studies have explored interactions between ARs and continental cyclones, and this paper highlights the need for further research on AR‐associated extreme weather events inland."

However, there is no one quantitative definition for what constitutes an atmospheric river, leading to uncertainty in quantifying how these systems respond to global change. This study seeks to better understand how different AR detection tools (ARDTs) respond to changes in climate states utilizing single‐forcing climate model experiments under the aegis of the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP). We compare a simulation with an early Holocene orbital configuration and another with CO2 levels of the Last Glacial Maximum to a preindustrial control simulation to test how the ARDTs respond to changes in seasonality and mean climate state, respectively. We find good agreement among the algorithms in the AR response to the changing orbital configuration, with a poleward shift in AR frequency that tracks seasonal poleward shifts in atmospheric water vapor and zonal winds. In the low CO2 simulation, the algorithms generally agree on the sign of AR changes, but there is substantial spread in their magnitude, indicating that mean‐state changes lead to larger uncertainty. This disagreement likely arises primarily from differences between algorithms in their thresholds for water vapor and its transport used for identifying ARs. These findings warrant caution in ARDT selection for paleoclimate and climate change studies in which there is a change to the mean climate state, as ARDT selection contributes substantial uncertainty in such cases."

The South China Sea (SCS) suffers the most frequent TCs among global oceans and contains active eddies. On average, one TC encounters and interacts with at least one eddy during its lifespan in the SCS. Using 27‐year satellite data and numerical simulations, we examined the response and feedback of mesoscale eddies to TCs over the SCS, based on TCs' interaction with 183 cyclonic ocean eddies (COEs) and 152 anticyclonic ocean eddies (AOEs). TCs induce a symmetric sea surface height reduction with maximum reduction (∼5 cm on average) appearing at the TC center. Pre‐existing COEs (AOEs) are enhanced (weakened) by TCs with an average 24% increase (17% decrease) in amplitude and enlarged (shrunk) with an average 19% increase (13% decrease) in radius. Stronger or slower‐moving TCs enhance COEs more significantly. Pre‐TC existing COEs (AOEs) enhance (suppress) TC‐induced sea surface cooling, and thus suppress (fuel) TC intensification, with the effect of COEs statistically stronger than AOEs. This modulating effect is more pronounced under stronger or slower‐moving TCs. Eddy's location also influences the modulating effect, with pre‐TC COEs located to the left (right) of TC track shifting the largest cooling leftwards (rightwards). Furthermore, the left‐located COEs increase cooling amplitude by 61%, stronger than right‐located COEs (26%). These results suggest that the combination of mesoscale eddies and TC attributes complicates TC‐induced sea surface cooling, which potentially affects TC intensification, wind structure, and rainfall."

However, the studies on projected changes in snow‐related extremes across the Tianshan Mountains (TS) and Pamir regions have been underexplored. Utilizing regional climate model downscaling and bias‐corrected CMIP6 data, this study examined the changes in snowmelt and water available for runoff (SMROS, rainfall plus snowmelt) during the cold seasons across these regions for historical (1994–2014) and future (2040–2060) periods under shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP245 and SSP585). The results demonstrated that accumulated snowmelt was projected to rise by 17.98% and 20.36%, whereas SMROS could increase by 26.97% and 28.95%, respectively, under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. Despite relatively minimal changes in extreme snowmelt, the magnitude of the historical daily maximum extreme SMROS (10‐year return level) was 28.04 mm and was expected to increase by 15.32% and 15.31% under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively, especially in western TS exceeding 26%. Meanwhile, areas with a daily extreme SMROS exceeding 50 mm could rise by over 13.5%. A notable rise in daily extreme SMROS and its area occupation in high intensity highlighted an increased risk of rainfall‐driven extreme snowmelt events. The absolute increase in snowfall and frequent snow‐rain phase transitions during the cold season under climate warming (SSP245: 2.19°C and SSP585: 2.22°C) benefits the increase in high‐intensity rain‐on‐snow events, leading to extreme SMROS augmentation. The findings emphasize the significant role of rainfall‐trigger snowmelt events in exacerbating extreme snowmelt in a warming climate."

By integrating radiative transfer equations, we calculated the whitecap coverage (W), determined that a 4 km window size is optimal for calculating W, and established a whitecap coverage‐sea surface wind speed model. A sliding window method was used to achieve high‐resolution (100 m) large‐area sea surface wind speed estimations. More importantly, this study provides new insights into the impact of different wind and wave conditions on W and regional variations in the whitecap coverage‐sea surface wind speed model from an optical satellite perspective, which can effectively quantify the wind‐wave breaking and distinguish the regional variations of them in different offshore seas. By comparing with 10‐m resolution data from the Sentinel‐2 Multi‐Spectral Instrument, we further clarified the impact of spatial resolution on the selection of methods for calculating W, revealing scale effects in optical remote sensing of whitecap detection and proposing corresponding W calculation strategies.

Results show that current dynamical models have high skills in predicting the QBO evolution benefiting from their capability of characterizing the typical downward propagation of QBO. Further analyses show that most models can reasonably reproduce the QBO teleconnection patterns, but with weaker amplitude than observation, which may be due to the underestimation of the Holton‐Tan effect in models. Prediction skills of the QBO teleconnections to winter surface climate patterns are not yet satisfactory in some models though they have quite high QBO skills.

Most research on the ecological impacts of climate change has focused on climatic averages, which might differ from ECEs. Rhododendron, a diverse genus of alpine and subalpine woody plant, plays a crucial role in ecosystem stability and biodiversity in the biodiversity hotspots of the Himalayas and Hengduan Mountains. Here, we compared the predicted impacts of average climate with those including ECEs on 189 Rhododendron species in China for the historical period (1981–2010) and the future period (2071–2100) under two emissions scenarios (SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5). We analyzed changes in suitable habitat and patterns of species richness, weighted endemism, and phylogenetic diversity, identifying areas of coinciding high‐risk as priority conservation areas. Inclusion of ECEs altered the projected areas of suitable habitat across all species from an increase of over 3% to a decrease exceeding 10%, with the distribution of most Rhododendron species strongly influenced by extremes of drought and high temperatures. We found fewer than 18% of high‐risk areas of diversity loss were currently protected, with priority conservation areas mainly located in the Daxue, Daliang, Wumeng, and Jade Dragon Snow Mountains, as well as in the Nyingchi.

 Controls on organic carbon preservation in marine sediments remain controversial but crucial for understanding past and future climate dynamics. Here we develop a conceptual-mathematical model to determine the key processes for the preservation of organic carbon. The model considers the major processes involved in the breakdown of organic carbon, including dissolved organic carbon hydrolysis, mixing, remineralization, mineral sorption and molecular transformation. This allows redefining of burial efficiency as preservation efficiency, which considers both particulate organic carbon and mineral-phase organic carbon. We show that preservation efficiency is almost three times higher than the conventionally defined burial efficiency and reconciles predictions with global field data. Kinetic sorption and transformation are the dominant controls on organic carbon preservation. We conclude that a synergistic effect between kinetic sorption and molecular transformation (geopolymerization) creates a mineral shuttle in which mineral-phase organic carbon is protected from remineralization in the surface sediment and released at depth. The results explain why transformed organic carbon persists over long timescales and increases with depth.

 Escalating impacts of climate change underscore the risks posed by crossing potentially irreversible Earth and socioecological system thresholds and adaptation limits. However, limitations in the provision of actionable climate information may hinder an anticipatory response. Here we suggest a reversal of the traditional impact chain methodology as an end-user focused approach linking specific climate risk thresholds, including at the local level, to emissions pathways. We outline the socioeconomic and value judgement dimensions that can inform the identification of such risk thresholds. The applicability of the approach is highlighted by three examples that estimate the required CO2 emissions constraints to avoid critical levels of health-related heat risks in Berlin, fire weather in Portugal and glacier mass loss in High Mountain Asia. We argue that linking risk threshold exceedance directly to global emissions benchmarks can aid the understanding of the benefits of stringent emissions reductions for societies and local decision-makers.

Torn,Substantial and overlooked greenhouse gas emissions from deep Arctic lake sediment,"Deep permafrost soils produce comparable amounts of greenhouse gases as shallow soils in response to warming, according to incubation experiments of deep Arctic lake sediments. 
 Thermokarst lakes cause abrupt and sustained permafrost degradation and have the potential to release large quantities of ancient carbon to the atmosphere. Despite concerns about how lakes will affect the permafrost carbon feedback, the magnitude of carbon dioxide and methane emissions from deep permafrost soils remains poorly understood. Here we incubated a very deep sediment core (20 m) to constrain the potential productivity of thawed Yedoma and underlying Quaternary sand and gravel deposits. Through radiocarbon dating, sediment incubations and sediment facies classifications, we show that extensive permafrost thaw can occur beneath lakes on timescales of decades to centuries. Although it has been assumed that shallow, aerobic carbon dioxide production will dominate the climate impact of permafrost thaw, we found that anaerobic carbon dioxide and methane production from deep sediments was commensurate with aerobic production on a per gram carbon basis, and had double the global warming potential at warmer temperatures.

 Productivity in the Pleistocene glacial Southern Ocean was probably enhanced owing to iron fertilization by aeolian dust. Marine sediments indicate such an increase north of the modern Antarctic Polar Front but reduced biogenic activity south of it. However, quantitative estimates for the integrated net effect are difficult to obtain. Here we use the SO42− isotopic composition and other geochemical ice core records from the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean to reconstruct net changes in integrated biogenic sulfur productivity in the surface ocean over the penultimate glacial termination. We show that biogenic SO42− aerosol contributes 58% and 85% to the sulfate budget in Dronning Maud Land during glacial and interglacial times, respectively, and that biogenic sulfate is derived predominately from the seasonal sea ice zone. Using our quantitative reconstruction of biogenic aerosol production in the Southern Ocean source region, we show that the average biogenic sulfate production integrated over the Atlantic sector was 16% higher in the penultimate glacial 137,000–153,000 years ago compared with the later Last Interglacial 120,000–125,000 years ago. An intermittent decrease in productivity observed during early peak interglacial warming suggests that a reduction in the seasonal sea ice zone may disrupt Southern Ocean ecosystems.

 Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into sustainable fuels and base chemicals requires precise control over and understanding of activity, selectivity and stability descriptors of the electrocatalyst under operation. Identification of the active phase under working conditions, but also deactivation factors after prolonged operation, are of the utmost importance to further improve electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 conversion. Here, we present a multiscale in situ investigation of activation and deactivation pathways of oxide-derived copper electrocatalysts under CO2 reduction conditions. Using well-defined Cu2O octahedra and cubes, in situ X-ray scattering experiments track morphological changes at small scattering angles and phase transformations at wide angles, with millisecond to second time resolution and ensemble-scale statistics. We find that undercoordinated active sites promote CO2 reduction products directly after Cu2O to Cu activation, whereas less active planar surface sites evolve over time. These multiscale insights highlight the dynamic and intimate relationship between electrocatalyst structure, surface-adsorbed molecules, and catalytic performance, and our in situ X-ray scattering methodology serves as an additional tool to elucidate the factors that govern electrocatalyst (de)stabilization.

 WNT/β-catenin signaling plays key roles in development and cancer1,2. ZNRF3/RNF43 modulates Frizzleds through ubiquitination, dampening WNT/β-catenin signaling. Conversely, RSPO1-4 binding to LGR4-6 and ZNRF3/RNF43 enhances WNT/β-catenin signaling3–5. Here, we elucidate the overall landscape of architectures in multiple LGR4, RSPO2, and ZNRF3 assemblies, showcasing varying stoichiometries and arrangements. These structures reveal that LGR4 and RSPO2 capture distinct states of ZNRF3. The intrinsic heterogeneity of the LGR4-RSPO2-ZNRF3 assembly is influenced by LGR4 content. Particularly, in the assembly complex with a 2:2:2 ratio, two LGR4 protomers induce and stabilize the inactive state of ZNRF3, characterized by a wide inward-open conformation of two transmembrane helices (TM helices). This specific assembly promotes a stable complex, facilitating LGR4-induced endocytosis of ZNRF3. In contrast, the active dimeric ZNRF3, bound by a single LGR4, adopts a coiled-coil TM helices conformation and dimerization of RING domains. Our findings unveil how LGR4 content mediates diverse assemblies, leading to conformational rearrangements in ZNRF3 to regulate WNT/β-catenin signaling, and provide a structural foundation for drug development targeting Wnt-driven cancers.

 Skillful seasonal climate prediction is critical for food and water security over the world’s heavily populated regions, such as in continental East Asia. Current models, however, face significant difficulties in predicting the summer mean rainfall anomaly over continental East Asia, and forecasting rainfall spatiotemporal evolution presents an even greater challenge. Here, we benefit from integrating the spatiotemporal evolution of rainfall to identify the most crucial patterns intrinsic to continental East-Asian rainfall anomalies. A physical-statistical prediction model is developed to capture the predictability offered by these patterns through a detection of precursor signals that describe slowly varying lower boundary conditions. The presented model demonstrates a prediction skill of 0.51, at least twice as high as that of the best dynamical models available (0.26), indicating improved prediction for both the spatiotemporal evolution and summer mean of rainfall anomalies. This advance marks a crucial step toward delivering skillful seasonal predictions to populations in need of new tools for managing risks of both near-term climate disasters, such as floods and droughts, and long-term climate change.

We design three ionizable oligomers (IOs) that, with polylactide-polyethylene glycol (PLA-PEG), form a potential siRNA delivery system, named Ionizable Polymeric Micelles (IPMs). The siRNA encapsulated IPMs escape from lysosomes upon cellular uptake, and silence the target gene.

Moreover, IPMs and FAPi-IPMs mitigate ABC effect and produce fewer PEG antibodies than LNPs, and show minimal apolipoprotein adsorption in vivo compared with LNPs, differentiating their targeting effects from LNPs.

 Charting future emissions pathways is a central tenet of IPCC assessment reports (AR), yet it is unclear how underlying drivers (including around policy and technology) have influenced the evolution of emissions pathways. Here we compare scenarios in AR5 and AR6 and find that scenarios without specific climate policies enforced have shifted lower in each scenario generation, owing to falling low-carbon technology costs and reduced expectations for economic growth, reducing fossil-fuel shares in energy and industry. Mitigation pathways consistent with 1.5–2 °C have seen increasing electrification rates and higher shares of variable renewables in electricity in more recent scenario generations, implying reduced reliance on coal, nuclear, bioenergy and carbon capture and storage, reflecting changing costs. Despite the shrinking carbon budget due to insufficient recent climate action, mitigation costs have not increased given more optimistic low-carbon technology cost projections. Moving forward, scenario producers must continually recalibrate to keep abreast of technology, policy and societal developments to remain policy relevant.

 Coastal ecosystems provide a range of services including erosion prevention, clean water provision and carbon sequestration. With climate change, the rapid change in frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones may alter the composition of the ecosystems themselves potentially degrading the services they provide.

 Fossils preserving soft tissues and lightly biomineralized structures are essential for the reconstruction of past ecosystems and their evolution.

Here we investigate the decay of marine and freshwater shrimps deposited on the surface of three different clay beds.

This is the first experimental evidence for the replication of arthropod lightly biomineralized structures in aluminosilicates shortly after death, while carcasses are not buried by sediments. The preservation of morphology through aluminosilicates could result in carcasses persisting on the seafloor for weeks without losing much external anatomical information.

 The prediction of landslide deformation is crucial for early warning systems. While conventional geotechnical in-situ monitoring is restricted due to its high cost and spatial limitations over large regions, deep learning-based methodologies with remote sensing data have become increasingly prevalent in contemporary predictive research, yet this frequently engenders the enigmatic “black box” issue. To address this, we improve the landslide displacement prediction framework by combining interpretable deep learning based on an attention mechanism and Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) techniques. MT-InSAR is first used to extract a landslide displacement time series from Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR images. Then Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is employed to separate the nonlinear displacement time series into trend, seasonal, and noise components. The Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) are applied to predict trend and seasonal displacements, respectively. The inputs for these predictions are determined by analyzing landslide influencing factors. This study uses the Xinpu landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China to evaluate the proposed method and compare its performance with existing models. The CNN-Attention-BiGRU algorithm effectively captures the nonlinear relationship between landslide deformation and its triggering factors, outperforming conventional deep learning models such as BiLSTM, BiGRU, and CNN-BiGRU, achieving improvements in Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) by 21%—55% and Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) by 23%—56%. By applying deep learning with an attention mechanism, our proposed method considers the underlying principles of landslide deformation, and factors with higher relative importance for prediction modeling are interpreted to be concentrated annually between April and August, enabling a more effective and more accurate prediction of large-scale landslide kinematics for the studied reservoir region."

 The 2020 Meiyu season in Anhui, China, brought unprecedented rainfall, driven by a unique interplay of high precipitation frequency and elevated convective rainfall. This study examines the distinctive microphysical characteristics of raindrop size distribution (DSD) during this record-breaking season, using minute-level data from six disdrometer stations. Brief but intense rain events contributed up to 49.4 % of the total seasonal rainfall in only 6–7 % of the duration, with the mean drop diameter increasing from 1.2 mm to 2.1 mm and the mean normalized intercept parameter rising from 2.7 to 4.1 as rainfall rate intensified. Compared to prior Meiyu studies, our findings reveal distinct DSD patterns with larger raindrops and higher concentrations, reflecting a more convective-dominated structure unique to the 2020 season. Novel μ–Λ and Z − R relationships tailored for this event revealed larger raindrop sizes and concentrations compared to past studies. Enhanced dual-polarization radar rainfall prediction models were developed, with relationships between Zdr, Zh, Kdp, and rainfall rate (R) showing exceptional accuracy, as evidenced by correlation coefficients nearing 1.0 and low RMSE and NMAE values. Additionally, new KE–R relationships accurately estimated rainfall kinetic energy (KE), with Power Law models best representing KEtime–R and Logarithmic fits for KEmm–R. These findings demonstrate the importance of DSD-specific insights for understanding microphysical processes and improving QPE accuracy, with implications for flood and soil erosion management in eastern China."

Recent advances in 100-keV imaging with the emergence of sub–200-keV optimized DED technology promises the development of more affordable cryo-TEMs. So far, 100-keV imaging has required microscopes with FEG sources. We here explored whether a standard 120-keV TEMs with thermionic lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) source can be upgraded with a sub–200-keV DED for high-resolution cryo-EM. Using this imaging configuration, we successfully obtained a 2.65 Å reconstruction for apoferritin, 4.33 Å for 64-kDa hemoglobin, and 4.4 Å for an asymmetric 153kDa membrane protein GPCR.

However, the mechanisms controlling the activity of noncentrosomal MTOCs are poorly understood. Here, using the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombeas a model organism, we demonstrate that the kinesin-14 motor Klp2 interacts with the J-domain Hsp70/Ssa1 cochaperone Rsp1, an inhibitory factor of microtubule assembly, and that Klp2 is required for the proper localization of Rsp1 to microtubules. In addition, we demonstrate that Klp2 is not required for the localization of Mto1, a factor promoting microtubule assembly, to microtubules. Moreover, Rsp1-Ssa1 inhibits the interaction of Mto1-Mto2 with the gamma-tubulin small complex. The absence of Klp2 reduces the colocalization of Rsp1 and Mto1 foci on preexisting microtubules, resulting in an increased microtubule-dependent microtubule assembly. Our results suggest that Klp2 regulates the activity of noncentrosomal MTOCs by targeting Rsp1 to the sites of Mto1 activity and reveal a mechanism for the inhibition of noncentrosomal microtubule assembly by a kinesin-14 motor."

To investigate the impact of socially transmitted information about rewards on individual behavior, we used Eco-HAB, an automated system monitoring the voluntary behavior of group-housed mice under seminaturalistic conditions. In these settings, male mice spontaneously form social networks, with individuals occupying diverse positions. We show that a rewarded group member’s scent affects the ability of conspecifics to search for rewards in familiar and novel environments. The scent’s impact depends on the animal’s social position. Furthermore, disruption of neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex (PL) disrupts the social networks and animals’ interest in social information related to rewards; only the latter is blocked by the acute PL inhibition.

HCN channel activation contributes to pain perception, and propofol, a widely used anesthetic, acts as an analgesic by inhibiting the voltage-dependent activity of HCN channels. However, the molecular determinants of propofol action on HCN channels remain unknown. Here, we use a propofol-analog photoaffinity labeling reagent to identify propofol binding sites in the human HCN1 isoform. Mass spectrometry analyses combined with molecular dynamics simulations show that a binding pocket is formed by extracellularly facing residues in the S3 and S4 transmembrane segments in the resting voltage-sensor conformation. Mutations of residues within the putative binding pocket mitigate or eliminate voltage-dependent modulation of HCN1 currents by propofol.

Although this complex transformation has been structurally well studied, the reaction pathway and the resulting temporal evolution have remained elusive. We used an integrated biophysical approach to monitor prepore-to-pore transition and found a reaction time of ~30 hours for a complete transition. We show two asynchronous general steps of the process, shell opening and channel ejection, with the overall reaction pathway being a slow multistep process involving three intermediates. Liposomes, an increasingly high pH, or receptors facilitate shell opening, which is directly correlated with an increased rate of the prepore-to-pore transition. Channel ejection is a near-instantaneous process which occurs with a transition time of <60 milliseconds.

To address this deficiency, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a comprehensive census of transcriptomic cell types ofDrosophilaclock neurons. We focused principally on the enigmatic DN3s, which constitute most fly brain clock neurons and were previously almost completely uncharacterized. These DN3s are organized into 12 clusters with unusual gene expression features compared to the more well-studied clock neurons. We further show that previously uncharacterized DN3 subtypes promote sleep through a G protein–coupled receptor,TrissinR. Our findings indicate an intricate regulation of sleep behavior by clock neurons and highlight their remarkable diversity in gene expression and functional properties."

OsCSN5 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the E3 ligase OsPUB45. Overexpression ofOsPUB45increased resistance againstM. oryzaeandXoo, while dysfunction ofOsPUB45decreased resistance. In addition, OsCSN5 stabilized OsCUL3a to promote the degradation of a positive regulator OsNPR1. Overexpression ofOsPUB45compromised accumulation of OsCUL3a, leading to stabilization of OsNPR1, whereas mutations inOsPUB45destabilized OsNPR1.

The CDW phase can be retrieved over the entire sample from diffracted intensities using a genetic algorithm. For currents below threshold, increasing shear deformation is observed in the central part of the sample while longitudinal deformation appears above threshold when shear relaxes. Shear thus precedes longitudinal deformation, with relaxation of one leading to the appearance of the other.
