Ferrara;Anna Roik;Franziska Wöhrmann-Zipf;Maren Ziegler,Ex Situ Thermal Preconditioning Modulates Coral Physiology and Enhances Heat Tolerance: A Multispecies Perspective for Active Restoration,"Global warming threatens reef-building corals by challenging their adaptive capacity. Therefore, interventions such as stress-hardening by thermal preconditioning could become crucial for their survival. This study aimed to systematically assess the effects of distinct thermal preconditioning regimes (stable-high at 29 °C, variable-high at 29 ± 1.5 °C, and stable-ambient control at 26 °C) on the baseline physiology and thermal tolerance of six stony coral species (Galaxea fascicularis, Porites rus, Acropora muricata, Montipora digitata, Pocillopora verrucosa, and Stylophora pistillata) to determine commonalities in the stress-hardening responses that transcend species-specific signatures. For this, we quantified changes in photosynthetic efficiency and bleaching intensity before and after a short-term heat stress assay and up to 30 days later. Stress-hardening was successful in all preconditioned corals, with the variable-high regime slightly outperforming the stable-high regime. Preconditioning reduced the heat stress response by up to 90%, yet species differed in receptiveness. It also improved resilience (survival and recovery), and corals with high inherent thermal tolerance recovered better than susceptible species. Notably, both preconditioning regimes affected baseline physiology, exclusively of the branching species, causing tissue paling and decreased photosynthetic efficiency. We conclude that implementing thermal stress-hardening protocols requires consideration of the species-specific receptiveness and potential physiological trade-offs."

In this study, based on a simple one-step pyrolysis method, we designed a Cu single-atom catalyst with high active site exposure and a locally electron-deficient environment (HE Cu1–N4) to achieve maximum utilization efficiency in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR). Using advanced characterization techniques, we confirmed that its unique 3D structure enhances Cu atom exposure and reduces nitrate (NO3–) mass transfer resistance. Synchrotron radiation and DFT calculations showed that adjusting the coordination environment induces a local electron-deficient effect in Cu atoms, increasing the electrostatic attraction to NO3–. HE Cu1–N4 achieved 100% NH3 selectivity across a wide range of NO3– concentrations, with an NH3 yield (5.09 mg h–1 mgcat–1) nearly 7-fold higher than that of the conventional unmodified Cu single-atom catalyst (Cu1–N2, 0.73 mg h–1 mgcat–1). Under pilot-scale conditions, HE Cu1–N4 demonstrated strong resistance to interference and excellent stability in complex water systems. A simple modification method enhanced the utilization efficiency of single atoms in single-atom catalysts, significantly improving the catalytic activity of the material. Moreover, this straightforward synthesis strategy holds promise for the large-scale production of single-atom catalysts, paving the way for practical engineering applications."

Here, we developed and deployed an automated, low-cost, and time-resolved system for noninvasive monitoring of air toxicity by detecting eight breath-borne biomarkers from rats, including VOCs, CO2, CO, NO, H2S, H2O2, O2, and NH3. Using this system, two large-scale monitoring campaigns were conducted across 13 cities in China during the 2023 winter and 2024 spring continuously on a 24-h-a-day basis. In characterizing overall air pollution health impact, a novel Air Toxic Index (ATI) was developed using the eight breath-borne biomarkers from the rats. Significant differences in diurnal patterns of ATI were observed across 13 cities. Among others, time, city, PM2.5, and O3 were identified as the primary influencing factors of ATI, exhibiting complex nonlinear relationships in real-world environments. The unique variation patterns of breath-borne NO and H2O2 from rats indicated the time-resolved impacts of ground human activities on weekends and PM components on air toxicity. Histopathologic changes in these deployed rats’ lungs further validated the differential health effects of real-world air pollution from different cities as detected by the rat system. Here, we pioneer a new air pollution health effect monitoring system that realizes the in vivo detection of air toxicity in contrast to the traditional protocol of air sampling, exposure, and offline toxicity analysis steps. The system can be deployed easily to any location with minimal support for real-time monitoring of air pollution health impacts."

Here, a cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the associations of PFAS with genotoxic biomarkers. We recruited a cohort of 453 residents in 2021 in Zhejiang, China. Thirty PFAS in serum were quantified, alongside seven indicators of genomic stability [five rDNA copy numbers (rDNA-CN), mitochondrial DNA copy numbers (mtDNA-CN), and relative telomere length (RTL)] in whole blood. Results showed that PFUnDA, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), 6:2 Cl-PFESA, and PFO5DoDA were positively correlated with rDNA-CN, while PFHpA, PFOA, and PFMOAA showed inverse associations. PFO4DA and PFO5DoDA were positively correlated with mtDNA-CN. PFOA, HFPO-TA, and PFMOAA were negatively associated with the RTL, while perfluorononanoic acid, PFHxS, PFOS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA showed positive associations. Nonlinear exposure–response relationships were also observed between PFAS and genotoxic biomarkers using restricted cubic spline models. Furthermore, PFAS mixtures were positively associated with mtDNA-CN, with PFO5DoDA showing the highest contribution by the quantile-based g-computation model. In vivo studies further confirmed that PFO5DoDA increased mtDNA-CN in male mice in a dose-dependent manner.

However, mechanisms of its survival in such environments remain seldom explored. In this study, the acute toxicity of selenomethionine (Se-Met) in a variety of species (four oviparous and four ovoviviparous species) was evaluated, followed by the chronic effects of Se-Met on G. affinis and on zebrafish (Danio rerio (D. rerio)), focusing on Se accumulation in the gonads and offspring, reproductive biology, and offspring development. Our results showed that the LC50-96h of Se-Met was the largest in G. affinis among the eight fish, confirming its elevated resistance to Se. Meanwhile, the transcripts of genes related to selenoproteins and sulfoproteins showed opposite responses between G. affinis and D. rerio to Se-Met exposure, along with the altered levels of total selenoproteins in oviparous but not in ovoviviparous fish. The chronic exposures showed that Se levels in the gonads, effects on gonadal development and embryonic and early larval development, and Se efflux in the embryos and larvae were apparently different between G. affinis and D. rerio. Finally, differentially expressed genes (particularly antioxidant and inflammation) were mostly stimulated in G. affinis but inhibited in D. rerio. This study has demonstrated that the Se efflux capacity of the offspring and genes related to Se metabolism and antioxidant physiology can help partially explain the survival of G. affinis in Se-contaminated ecosystems."

Previous work has shown an increase in the level of BAP in smoke plumes. The mechanism of their emission, whether from combustion of biological material or coemission with dust and soil from fire-driven winds, has yet to be examined. We carried out a series of controlled combustion experiments to understand the role of vegetation type and combustion conditions in the direct emission of BAP. The fuels we used included broadleaf, evergreen, and grass. We measured the emitted fluorescent BAP using a wideband integrated bioaerosol system (WIBS), and we measured the viability of filter-collected BAP using flow cytometry. Our measurements showed that the size and absolute concentration of the fluorescent BAP, and the viability of the BAP emitted during combustion, depend on the combustion conditions. In addition, the type of fuel impacted the type of emitted fluorescent BAP fraction relative to the total concentration of the emitted aerosol."

However, the precipitation response to this recent forest cover change remains unclear. Here, we examined biophysical effects of forest cover change in the Brazilian Amazon on dry season precipitation using a regional coupled climate model with embedded water vapor tracers. We find that the 3.2% mean reduction in forest cover that occurred in Rondônia and Mato Grosso during 2002–2015 caused a 3.5 ± 0.8% reduction in evapotranspiration and a 5.4 ± 4.4% reduction in precipitation. The reduction in evapotranspiration warmed and dried the lower atmosphere reducing convection and precipitation. Reductions in incoming moisture, dominated by reduced moisture inflow in the mid‐troposphere, accounted for 25% of the total reduction in moisture and amplified the precipitation response to forest loss. The reduction in precipitation efficiency explains 84.5% of the reduction in precipitation with the remainder due to reductions in precipitable water. The reduced precipitation sourced from water vapor inflow accounts for 76.9% of the simulated precipitation reduction, with the remaining 23.1% due to reduced local evapotranspiration. Our study demonstrates substantial reductions in dry season precipitation due to recent forest cover change in the Amazon, highlighting the importance of atmospheric responses to land cover change in this region."

Blattmann,The Known Unknowns of Petrogenic Organic Carbon in Soils,"Intensifying effects of global climate change have spurred efforts to enhance carbon sequestration and the long‐term storage of soil organic carbon (OC). Current soil carbon models predominantly assume that inputs of OC are biospheric, that is, primarily derived from plant decomposition. However, these overlook the contribution of OC from soil parent material, including petrogenic organic carbon (OCpetro) from OC‐bearing (meta‐)sedimentary bedrock. To our knowledge, no soil carbon model accounts for the inputs of OCpetro to soils, resulting in significant gaps in our understanding about the roles OCpetro plays in soils. Here, we call for cross‐disciplinary research to investigate the transport and stability of OCpetro across the bedrock–soil continuum. We pose four key questions as motivation for this effort. Ignoring the inputs of OCpetro to soils has significant implications, including overestimating biospheric carbon stocks and turnover times. Furthermore, we lack information on the role that OCpetro may play in priming microbial communities, as well as the impacts of land management on OCpetro stocks."

Predictive models for dissolution remain limited due to incomplete understanding of the mechanisms involved. We examine the influence of flow, transport, and reaction regimes on mineral dissolution using 29 time‐resolved data from 3D rocks. We find that initial pore structure significantly influences the dissolution pattern, with reaction rates up to two orders of magnitude lower than batch conditions, given solute and fluid‐solid boundary constraints. Flow unevenness determines the location and rate of dissolution. We propose two models describing expected dissolution patterns and effective reaction rates based on dimensionless metrics for flow, transport, and reaction. Finally, we analyze feedback between evolving flow and pore structure to understand conditions that regulate/reinforce dissolution hotspots. Our findings underscore the major impact of flow arrangement on reaction‐front propagation and provide a foundation for controlling dissolution hotspots."

Accurate prediction of the MJO is challenging partly due to its complex interactions with the background state and sensitivity to initial conditions and unresolved processes. Using NOAA's Unified Forecast System, we explore the impact of subtle differences in initial conditions on MJO forecasts over the Indo‐Pacific. Model runs initialized with two independent reanalyses show significant and systematic differences in MJO circulation amplitude that emerge rapidly and persist over the 15‐day forecast period. Additional analysis suggests the reason is due to differences in the initial atmospheric static stability. Specifically, the reanalysis that is initially less stable is associated with enhanced large‐scale vertical motion and divergent winds throughout the forecast. Notably, a convection‐based MJO index shows less sensitivity to initial conditions, suggesting that the differences in MJO circulation amplitude arise through mechanisms other than changes in convection or diabatic heating."

It is shown how these turbulent fields facilitate radial transport and pitch‐angle scattering that drive losses through the magnetopause, into the plasma sheet, through the plasmapause and to the atmosphere. Butterfly distributions are formed due to pitch‐angle scattering and the combined effect of the loss processes. For the observed spectrum of oscillations, it is estimated that Alfvénic turbulence drives order of magnitude depletions of outer radiation belt electron fluxes at relativistic energies over a period of a few hours. On the other hand, at lower energies, energization in transverse Alfvénic electric fields leads to enhancements of the electron spectrum to provide a source population for subsequent acceleration to higher energies and, in concert with the loss processes, provides exponential spectral form as a function of energy."

However, traditional climate models cannot resolve oceanic and atmospheric eddies that are critical to the LFWC variations. In this study, we investigate physical processes controlling Beaufort Gyre LFWC changes in an eddy‐resolving simulation. The model simulation largely reproduces the observed LFWC changes, and projects a long‐term LFWC increase with an intensification of its decadal variability during the 21st century. Freshwater budget analysis suggests that future LFWC changes are strongly influenced by sea ice melt. The conversion from solid to liquid phase provides more liquid freshwater into the ocean. Meanwhile, sea ice loss enhances the efficiency of air‐sea momentum transfer, leading to increased wind‐driven freshwater convergence and its variability. The decadal variation of the LFWC will regulate Arctic freshwater exports and coincident with an O (0.5 Sv) change in the meridional overturning circulation."

 Switching to alternative global diets offers established benefits, but the challenges and opportunities for individual countries during and after the transition remain unassessed. In this study, we project changes in water use, dietary quality, and food affordability under four dietary scenarios (including Mediterranean diet, the EAT-Lancet diet, the Healthy US-Style diet, and Vegetarian diet), assessing the potential implications at the country level from 2020 to 2070. Here, we show that by 2070, transitioning to healthy and sustainable diets can improve dietary quality by 30.29 – 45.43%, with all countries reducing water use (1.21 – 14.73%) and increasing food affordability (9.29 – 63.23%). However, in the initial phases, increased food demand escalated water use and worsened food affordability, especially in emerging and developing economies, with the maximum average deterioration being 2.62% and 13.06%, respectively. These highlight the need for long-term planning and financial support to ensure successful global transitions.

Here, the authors report that p53 protein degradation triggered by the MYC/URI axis, is an early event essential for tumor initiation in Wnt activation-based CRC models. 
 Incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing likely due to different mechanisms driving initiation and progression. The initial model proposed by Fearon and Vogelstein posits it as a multi-hit neoplasia, originating from adenomatous-polyps induced by WNT activation, ultimately progressing to aggressiveness through p53 loss. Integrating human data with mouse genetics, we redefine this paradigm, highlighting pivotal roles of MYC, oncogenic URI and p53 degradation to initiate CRC. Early APC loss activates MYC to transcriptionally upregulate URI, which modulates MDM2 activity, triggering p53 proteasomal degradation, essential for tumour initiation and mutation burden accrual in CRC mice. Remarkably, reinstating p53 levels via genetic URI depletion or p53 super-expression in CRC mice with WNT pathway activation prevents tumour initiation and extends lifespan. Our data reveal a “two-hit” genetic model central to APC loss-driven CRC initiation, wherein MYC/URI axis intricately controls p53 degradation, offering mechanistic insights into transitional mutation acquisition essential for CRC progression. Loss of the tumor suppressor p53 facilitates the malignant progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) following the initial transformation.

 Single atom and nanocluster catalysts are extensively investigated in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high catalytic activity and atomic utilization, while their coexisting properties and potentially synergistic effect are yet to be clarified. Herein, we construct three systems of atomic-scale catalysts (xNi/Mo2TiAlC2, x = 0.5, 1, and 1.5) for bio-ethanol reforming, which correspond to single atoms, single atoms mixed with nanoclusters, and nanoclusters. The respective hydrogen utilization efficiency of mixed-form catalyst increases by 43.7% and 29.3% compared to single atom and nanocluster catalysts. Results demonstrate that the adjacent Ni single atom facilitates electron transfer from Mo2TiAlC2 to Ni-Mo interface and raises the d-band center, thus enhancing bio-ethanol adsorption and activation; while the existence of Ni nanoclusters contributes to lowering the energy barriers of CH3CHO* dehydrogenation. The catalytically active sites are Ni-Mo alloyed single atoms with adjacent Ni nanoclusters.

While APB interacts with the N-terminal photosensory module of phyB (phyBPSM), it remains unclear whether APA interacts with phyAPSM. We report that both phyA and phyB interact with APA through C-terminal output module of phy (phyOPM), while phyB interacts additionally with APB through phyBPSM. Marchantia Mp-phy also interacts with PIFs via the phyOPM-APA interaction. The phyBOPM-APA interaction promotes PIF3 degradation but not mutual phyB destruction. The full-length phy-APA interaction is light-dependent, whereas the underlying phyOPM-APA interaction is not. We show that the Pr form, not the Pfr, of phyPSM competes with APA for phyOPM binding, explaining how the light-dependent phy-APA interaction arises from the light-independent phyOPM-APA interaction.

 Mapping enhancers and target genes in disease-related cell types provides critical insights into the functional mechanisms of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) variants. Single-cell multimodal data, which measure gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same cells, enable the cell-type-specific inference of enhancer-gene pairs.

In blood and brain data, scMultiMap shows appropriate type I error control, high statistical power, and computational efficiency (1% of existing methods).

 As the ocean absorbs over 90% of excess radiative heat, recent ocean warming is shaped by a combination of anthropogenic surface heat gain and dynamical processes redistributing heat. To distinguish these contributions, we introduce a novel framework that decomposes temperature changes into three components: ‘spice’ (density-compensated variability) and ‘heave’ (density-contributing variability), with heave further divided into ‘passive’ (net warming) and ‘dynamic’ (redistribution) contributions. Passive heave captures anthropogenic warming subducted along isopycnals, while spice and dynamic heave, which globally sum to zero, represent heat redistribution. Observations and climate models demonstrate general agreement on passive heave, establishing it as a key oceanic fingerprint of anthropogenic climate change. In contrast, dynamic heave, driven by interannual-to-decadal variability, exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity, with notable discrepancies between models and observations. This framework links ocean heat uptake to sea-level change, with passive heave driving global thermosteric rise and dynamic heave contributing to regional dynamic sea level changes."

 The hydroxyl radical controls the removal of many trace gases in the atmosphere and initiates the production of secondary pollutants such as ground-level ozone and secondary organic aerosols. An accurate understanding of the chemistry of this radical is important to understand the self-cleansing capability of the atmosphere and to develop effective control strategies. A previous assessment found that in some regions, measurements of the hydroxyl radical were up to ten times greater than predicted, suggesting an unknown chemical mechanism was responsible. However, recent measurements have revealed interferences associated with some instruments. Here we show that accounting for interferences results in measured hydroxyl radical concentrations that agree with model predictions over a wide range of conditions. This suggests that while there may be gaps in our knowledge of this chemistry in some environments, our understanding of hydroxyl radical chemistry and the self-cleansing capability of the atmosphere is better than previously believed.

 Air pollution remains a major problem in many parts of California, significantly impacting public health and regional climate. However, the contribution of anthropogenic dust from agricultural sources, among major pollutants in California’s semi-arid Central Valley, remains largely unclear. Here, we used the Cropland Data Layer from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify crop types and land use/cover and leveraged satellite-derived estimates of major dust events between 2008 and 2022 over California. We identified fallowed land—an unplanted agricultural land parcel—as a key anthropogenic dust source in California. Specifically, we find that the Central Valley accounts for about 77% of total fallowed land areas in California, where they are associated with about 88% of major anthropogenic dust events. We also find that the geographic coverage of these fallowed lands expanded between 2008 and 2022 with associated increasing anthropogenic dust activities. Additionally, these anthropogenic dust activities are sensitive to the drought severity over the fallowed lands, with potential cumulative effects on downstream dust burden during prolonged multi-year drought conditions. Overall, our results have important implications for public health, including increased risk for Valley fever and for regional climates, such as increases in extreme precipitation and snowmelt over the Sierra Nevada.

 The world’s largest diversion-type hydropower system will be created on the Yarlung-Tsangpo Grand Canyon. The canyon, a critical region for hydropower development and ecological conservation, faces challenges under climate change. Here we evaluate the water-energy-ecosystem nexus in this hydropower system using the Water and Energy Transfer Processes in Large River Basins model and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III model. Key findings reveal that reservoir operations with medium replenishment flow (1000 m³ s−1) during dry periods achieve an optimal balance among hydropower generation annually (2231 × 108 kWh), flood mitigation (peak clipping rate 22.8%), and minimal ecosystem impact (eco-index 0.45). Hydropower development stabilizes runoff regimes, enhances flood control capacity under climate scenarios (e.g., 29.2% peak reduction under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 126), and mitigates downstream flood risks while supporting dry-season irrigation and navigation. Notably, under low-forcing climate change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 126), ecosystem stability is sustained primarily through the gradual and consistent replenishment of water resources from stabilized snowpack and glacial reserves.

 Understanding the impacts of glacier change on riverine ecosystems is limited by a lack of multi-year studies in glacierized mountain catchments quantifying the magnitude and stoichiometry of riverine biogeochemical yields. Here we evaluate riverine concentration-discharge relationships using the power function between daily runoff and element yields and stoichiometry across 10 catchments of varying glacial coverage within two climatically distinct regions in the Gulf of Alaska. Our multi-year study showed that biogeochemical stoichiometry and concentration-discharge relationships for dissolved carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus varied significantly with catchment glacier coverage across both regions. This stoichiometric variability could drive regional differences in proglacial riverine food webs given that high trophic levels in low productivity rivers are generally driven by bottom-up controls. The coherence of our findings across the Gulf of Alaska suggests that observed patterns in concentration-discharge relationships are likely globally generalizable to catchments in which discharge is dominated by glacier ice and/or snowmelt. Concentration-discharge relationships for dissolved carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in Gulf of Alaska rivers are driven by glacier catchment coverage, according to analysis of water samples from the Gulf of Alaska."

 The differential path tracing method and automatic differentiation can effectively calculate the derivatives of the loss function, enabling the estimation of surface properties such as reflectivity and transmissivity from sensor images. However, their full potential has not been completely explored in remote sensing. We developed a differentiable radiative transfer model (DRTM) to efficiently simulate and retrieve leaf optical properties, leaf biochemical components, and sensor observation angles from passive remote sensing imagery. The modeling accuracy is verified using various three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous landscapes, including natural vegetation-covered and artificial urban landscapes. The forward modeling part of DRTM has proved to be faster and more efficient in computer resource usage. In addition, DRTM demonstrated a much more effective adaptation of deep learning than the traditional look-up table method, to better resolve the most challenging inversions from canopy level to foliar level in vegetation remote sensing. In this context, DRTM can potentially address various inverse challenges in remote sensing within a unified framework."

 Intertidal zones are transitional areas between marine and terrestrial systems and are significant for ecological systems, socio-economic activities, and coastal erosion mitigation. However, intertidal topography is often degraded and lost by natural coastal processes and anthropogenic impacts. Accurate and frequent mapping of intertidal topography is essential for effective coastal management. Previous studies have relied on ground-based surveys or shoreline method using satellite imagery to measure intertidal topography, but these approaches are often limited in spatial extent and temporal resolution. To address these limitations, we propose LogiTide2DEM, a novel method for reconstructing intertidal topography. This method uses logistic regression to determine optimal tide heights for water-land differentiation as surface elevation using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. The advantages of LogiTide2DEM include: a pixel-based approach rather than shoreline methods, elevation constraints using tidal height records, adaptive elevation estimation using logistic regression, and integrated quality assessment of topographic data. We applied and validated LogiTide2DEM on the Changhua coast in central-western Taiwan, reconstructing 22 years (2002–2023) of intertidal topography. Results show root-mean-square differences in elevation ranging from 0.24 m to 0.59 m, with the ratio of mean absolute error to the DEM elevation range between 11 % and 13 %, and correlation coefficients of 0.69 to 0.81. Despite a moderate omission error in water-land classification, LogiTide2DEM demonstrates robust performance in reconstructing intertidal topography. This study shows the capability of LogiTide2DEM to generate high-resolution, reliable topography spanning past decades, providing valuable insights for coastal management and research."

 Crop yield estimation is vital for agricultural management but often struggles with predicting extreme values that can significantly impact operations and markets. Traditional models face challenges with these extremes, leading to biased and inaccurate predictions. To address this challenge, our study introduces two innovative strategies. First, we propose a cost-sensitive loss function, ExtremeLoss, designed to better capture and represent less frequent yield values by giving greater importance to extreme cases during training. Second, we develop a conditional deep learning model that enhances feature representation by conditioning on a binned yield observation map. This approach encourages smoother and more coherent input feature maps across different segments of the yield value range by leveraging similarities within and across yield bins, ultimately improving the model’s ability to generalize and distinguish between subtle variations in yield. This approach creates ”yield zone maps,” grouping yields into classes (e.g., low extreme, common, high extreme) to improve the identification of yield variability, which can be removed during inference. Our model was tested on a comprehensive grape yield dataset from 2016 to 2019, covering 2,200 hectares and 42 blocks of eight cultivars. We compared its performance against advanced techniques such as Focal-R loss, label distribution smoothing, dense weighting, and class-balanced methods under two validation scenarios: block-hold-out (BHO) and year-block-hold-out (YBHO). Our approach outperforms existing models in R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, it reduces MAE by +2.98 and +14.45 (t/ha) for low and high extremes in the BHO scenario and by +7.18 and +11.05 (t/ha) in the YBHO scenario. It also significantly decreases MAPE by +19.09% and +23.94% in the BHO scenario and by +33.76% and +19.61% in the YBHO scenario. Our model shows a marked improvement in capturing spatial variability and significantly advances spatio-temporal yield estimation, particularly for extreme values in complex agricultural settings like vineyards."

 The increased demand for forest management, particularly thinning, in Japan is a direct consequence of aging planted forests. However, forest inventories (FI) in Japan lack crucial details regarding the developmental stage or ecological status of forests, often only providing tree species, age, and owner information. The relative yield index (Ry) is a forest density index widely used in the forestry industry in Japan. It can be combined with tree height data to calculate tree density, diameter at breast height, timber volume, and basal area at breast height as the stand scale. Although Ry is a valuable indicator for forest management, no studies have been reported on its estimation over a large spatial scale. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to estimate the Ry of planted Japanese cedar and cypress forests at the stand scale over a large area by combining satellite imagery and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, which offer excellent vertical resolution.Data on surface temperature, which is sensitive to differences in forest density, was obtained from Landsat8 satellite imagery. Considering that surface temperature is highly dependent on topography, we developed a topography-aware normalized surface temperature index (ΩST) using surface temperature data and a digital elevation model. The leaf area index (LAI), which was positively correlated with Ry, was estimated from the enhanced vegetation index obtained from Landsat. A normalized LAI (ΩLAI) was developed to address differences in LAI attributable to tree height. The Ry estimation index (Ry_estimated) calculated using ΩST and ΩLAI was correlated with the Ry estimated from LiDAR data (correlation coefficient; r = 0.61–0.65), confirming its high accuracy (root mean square error; RMSE = 0.07–0.11). By applying this method to a 3,650 km2 area of planted Japanese cedar and cypress forests in the Kanto region of Japan, large-scale and detailed information on various forest characteristics was obtained. This method derives tree height data from LiDAR and extracts forest density information from satellite imagery. The combination of LiDAR data and satellite imagery potentially enhances the accuracy of forest-based estimates, reduces data acquisition costs, and improves the efficiency of creating and updating FIs."

 To investigate the pollution characteristics of PM2.5 and its associated heavy metals, we collected and analyzed PM2.5 samples from five industrial sources in Handan, namely production chimneys, workshops, factory areas, and two control points. Macroscopic and microscopic perspectives were employed to determine the contents of 11 heavy metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ba, and Pb) and one metalloid (As). The results revealed that the total average mass concentrations of the 12 metal elements followed the order: chimney (9598.64 ng·m−3) > workshop (7332.94 ng·m−3) > factory area (3104.31 ng·m−3) > control point B (2073.21 ng·m−3) > control point A (1004.74 ng·m−3). Fe, Ti, Zn, and Ni were the primary contributors to total metal content at each sampling site. Seasonal variations in heavy metal concentrations were minimal. Fe had the highest mass concentration among the metals at all sites (>60 %), whereas the Cr (VI) and As concentrations significantly exceeded the permitted levels. The particle types with a relatively high number in single particles emitted from chimney were mineral particles (31.58 %), iron-containing metal oxides (26.32 %), and soot aggregates (23.68 %). Mixed particles are primarily present as external mixtures. The AERMOD model simulation indicated significant regional dispersion of PM2.5 within 10 km, which was corroborated by sample analysis at the nearby control point. Indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratio modeling demonstrated that heavy metal concentrations were generally higher in workshops than in factory areas, suggesting the potential diffusion of some heavy metals from workshops to the factory atmosphere. Enrichment factor (EF) analysis showed that Fe was highly enriched (EF > 3000) at all sampling sites, with EFs at the control points exceeding 1000. These findings suggest that industrial emissions from the foundry industry in Handan contributed significantly to the ambient atmospheric Fe levels. Health risk assessment indicated a substantial non-carcinogenic risk (CR; hazard index >1) and a moderate CR (10−4 ≤ CR < 10−3) for the study area. Co, Cr (VI), Mn, and Pb pose significant non-CR, whereas Cr (VI) and As have been identified as key contributors to CR."

 Bioaerosols and associated health risks are increasingly scrutinized amid improving air quality and recurrent public health crises in China. However, the response of bioaerosols to the process of improving air quality remains unclear. Consequently, multi-year (2015–2023) bioaerosol samples were collected at two sampling sites (Yanta and Weishui) and analyzed using fluorescence counting combined with high-throughput sequencing to investigate long-term trends in bioaerosol concentrations and bacterial communities. Additionally, Prophet and XGBoost-SHAP models elucidated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bioaerosol concentrations and identified key drivers of bioaerosol fluctuations. Results showed that, unlike the decreasing trends in PM2.5 concentrations, bioaerosol concentrations initially decreased from (3.71 ± 0.88) × 105 cells/m3 to (0.7 ± 0.36) × 105 cells/m3 during 2015–2019, but rebounded to (7.54 ± 3.75) × 105 cells/m3 following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022), highlighting the complex interplay between policy interventions and public health disruptions. Notably, increases in bioaerosol concentrations correlated with influenza incidence rates, reflecting its potential health risks. Bacterial diversity was higher during the Blue Sky Defense War (2018–2020) than in other periods, while the dominant phylum (Proteobacteria, relative abundance range 32 %–89 %) were relatively stable. Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Paucibacter were the dominant genera during the observation period, and COVID-19 pandemic changed the structure of bacterial communities. Additionally, O3 correlated more significantly with long-term trends of bioaerosols than SO2 and RH. These results can provide scientific basis for comprehensive evaluation and formulation of urban air quality improvement measures and prevention policies."
