However, new results herein strongly suggest that IO3– could contribute to pollutant degradation and trigger disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation in the UV/IO4– process. The degradation of micropollutants, e.g., 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), followed two-stage pseudo-first-order kinetics along with the conversion of IO4– (stage I) to IO3– (stage II) in the UV/IO4– process. The radical scavenging experiments and electron spin resonance technique confirmed both reactive oxygen species (e.g., •OH and O3) and reactive iodine species (RIS) (e.g., IO3•), contributing to contaminant degradation in the UV/IO4– system. A kinetic model based on first-principles was further developed to simulate reaction kinetics, revealing that •OH was the primary reactive species responsible for EE2 degradation in stage I, while RIS, especially IO3•, played major contributions in stage II. The photolysis of IO3– in stage II could increase the risk of iodinated DBP (I-DBP) formation, especially under acidic conditions. The new findings of this work broaden the mechanistic knowledge on the UV/IO4– process and highlight the overlooked role of IO3– in the worrisome I-DPB formation in the wastewater treatment."

Smith,"Emissions of Nitrous Acid, Nitryl Chloride, and Dinitrogen Pentoxide Associated with Automotive Braking","As worldwide trends move toward replacing combustion transportation modes with electric vehicles, characterizing non-tailpipe emissions, such as those from brake wear, becomes increasingly important. Nitrous acid (HONO), nitryl chloride (ClNO2), and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) are important sources of radical oxidants (e.g., •OH, •Cl, •NO3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere, driving the chemistry that leads to air quality degradation. Discrepancies between measurements and model predictions indicate that there are significant unknown sources of these species, particularly HONO, where the contributions of different formation processes have been controversial since the first ambient observations in the 1970s. We report the generation of these reactive nitrogen species during automotive braking using chemical ionization mass spectrometry configured with iodide reagent ion. Substantial HONO levels are observed from ceramic and semi-metallic brake pads, and smaller quantities of ClNO2 and N2O5 were also detected. We propose that HONO is formed in the hot plume emanating from the brake rotor via abstraction by NO2 of allylic and aldehyde hydrogen atoms found in the complex mixture of volatile organic compounds emitted simultaneously. These results suggest that emissions from automotive braking must be taken into account in urban oxidation chemistry."

Fish are used as a model organism in these tests, but have many limitations, including a long time to reach steady-state, difficulty in maintaining constant exposure, and ethical concerns. We developed a method for the (simultaneous) assessment of chronic reproductive toxicity and bioaccumulation using Daphnia magna as a model organism. As test chemicals, we selected heterocyclic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (heterocyclic PAHs), which are often persistent and show high acute aquatic toxicity, raising concerns about their long-term effects. In this study, we developed a robust passive dosing method to maintain constant exposure in chronic toxicity and bioaccumulation tests of four heterocyclic PAHs in Daphnia magna. Passive dosing maintained stable exposure concentrations in the ng to μg L–1 range, even after reusing disks up to three times. All chemicals were toxic to Daphnia magna with EC10 values between 0.1 and 15 μg L–1. Bioaccumulation tests showed that steady-state was not reached, and the uptake rate constant (k1) could not be reliably determined due to complex exposure routes (both via water and diet). However, depuration rates in Daphnia magna were about 2 orders of magnitude higher than in fish, which is advantageous in the assessment of highly hydrophobic compounds. We propose to use the depuration rate constant (k2), which is independent of the uptake route, as an indicator of bioaccumulation potential. The k2 thresholds for Daphnia magna were estimated to identify (very) bioaccumulative compounds by correlating k2 values with bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for Daphnia magna and applying fish BCF thresholds. We suggest that a Daphnia magna bioaccumulation test can be used as a screening tool to trigger further bioaccumulation testing in fish, as it offers higher throughput, is more ethical, and reaches steady-state faster. However, further validation with reference test protocols and substances is essential."

However, due to the relatively scarce ligand data, receptor-based or ligand-based screening models for GPER are challenging. Inspired by functional similarity between GPER and ER, this study constructs a deep transfer learning model named GPNET to predict potential GPER-binding ligands by using three-dimensional (3D) molecular surface electrostatic potential point clouds (SepPC) as input. The model retains a part of molecular structural knowledge learned from the ER ligands and then trains the remaining parameters of the model using the GPER ligands, ultimately obtaining the GPNET model, which effectively predicts the binding activity of compounds with GPER. GPNET outperforms From Scratch (nontransfer) model on the small data set, achieving the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUCROC) of 0.898 on the validation set and 0.863 on the test set, respectively. Furthermore, by visualizing the critical points and extracting the features from activation points of active ligands, the study provides a more in-depth interpretation of the molecular mechanism of two bisphenol A (BPA) alternatives binding to GPER."

Based on direct hygroscopicity measurements conducted across diverse environments, this study quantified the impact of aerosol hygroscopicity on respiratory deposition utilizing the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) model. Our results demonstrate that hygroscopic growth of particles in the HRT notably reduces the total deposition fraction (TDF) for number by as much as 12%, whereas it significantly increases TDF for particle mass by up to 49% for submicrometer particles from various regional backgrounds. For near-source aerosols, mild variations in the TDF were observed, with changes of less than 10% for particle number and less than 17% for particle mass, owing to their low hygroscopicity. These findings imply the importance of appropriately considering aerosol hygroscopicity in assessing respiratory deposition. Furthermore, our results reveal that for many highly toxic aerosols, neglecting hygroscopicity has a negligible impact on deposition estimates. However, as aerosol toxicity under study decreases, the influence of hygroscopicity becomes more pronounced, largely increasing the TDF for mass, which highlights the significance of considering both aerosol cytotoxicity and hygroscopicity in assessing health risks."

However, the large number of environmental related compounds, combined with the low efficiency of traditional methods, has resulted in substantial gaps in neurotoxicity data. In this study, we developed a robust and interpretable neurotoxicity prediction model using a high-quality data set. To identify the best predictive model, three molecular representation methods (molecular fingerprints, molecular descriptors, and molecular graphs) combined with six traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms and two deep learning (DL) approaches were evaluated. The optimal model, combining molecular fingerprints and descriptors with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), achieved a training accuracy of 0.93 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, outperforming other ML and DL models, while maintaining interpretability. The model was used to screen 1170 compounds detected in human blood, predicting 1145 successfully. Among 89 compounds with known neurotoxicity data, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.74. It identified 821 potentially neurotoxic compounds, including 36 with high detection concentrations, warranting further study.

Jones;Christopher Daly;Mark Schulze;Christopher J. Stlll,"Microclimate Refugia Are Transient in Stable Old Forests, Pacific Northwest, USA","An issue of global concern is how climate change forcing is transmitted to ecosystems. Forest ecosystems in mountain landscapes may demonstrate buffering and perhaps decoupling of long‐term rates of temperature change, because vegetation, topography, and local winds (e.g., cold air pooling) influence temperature and potentially create microclimate refugia (areas which are relatively protected from climate change). We tested these ideas by comparing 45‐year regional rates of air temperature change to unique temporal and spatial air temperature records in the understory of regionally representative stable old forest at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. The 45‐year seasonal patterns and rates of warming were similar throughout the forested landscape and matched regional rates observed at 88 standard meteorological stations in Oregon and Washington, indicating buffering, but not decoupling of long‐term climate change rates. Consideration of the energy balance explains these results: while shading and airflows produce spatial patterns of temperature, these processes do not counteract global increases in air temperature driven by increased downward, longwave radiation forced by increased anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In some months, the 45‐year warming in the forest understory equaled or exceeded spatial differences of air temperature between the understory and the canopy or canopy openings and was comparable to temperature change over 1,000 m elevation, while in other months there has been little change. These findings have global implications because they indicate that microclimate refugia are transient, even in this forested mountain landscape."

Spatial evenness of daily precipitation decreases over land and ocean, tropics and extratropics. Changes in temporal evenness of local‐daily precipitation show a complex geographic pattern. However, particularly over land, we show that a simple theoretical scaling explains this complexity to result from increased precipitation intensity scaling at about the Clausius‐Clapeyron rate, and a local balance between changes in annual‐mean precipitation and dry‐day fraction. These results provide a novel perspective on the relation between global constraints on the hydrological cycle to regional precipitation changes independent of changes in the geographic distribution of precipitation."

This study examines the relative effects of eastern Pacific (EP) and central Pacific (CP) ENSO in driving the PNA teleconnection during boreal autumn. Results show that CP SST anomalies are significantly more efficient, with a one‐degree CP anomaly inducing more than twice the circulation changes of an equivalent EP anomaly. Two factors contribute to this difference: CP warming triggers stronger atmospheric convection, and the associated regional Hadley circulation (HC) anomaly is broader and shifted westward compared to that induced by EP warming. This enhances interaction with the subtropical jet, strengthening the Rossby wave source. These findings underscore the pivotal role of regional HC in amplifying atmospheric teleconnection patterns, highlighting its importance amid the increasing frequency of CP ENSO events under a changing climate."

We call the muted increases or reductions at these altitudes the “double dip.” The double dip results from surface warming (not stratospheric cooling). Using an idealized photochemical‐transport model, surface warming is found to produce the double dip via tropospheric expansion, which converts ozone‐rich stratospheric air into ozone‐poor tropospheric air. The lower dip results from expansion of the extratropical troposphere, as previously understood. The upper dip results from expansion of the tropical troposphere, low‐ozone anomalies from which are then transported into the extratropics. Large seasonality in the double dip in CCMs can be explained, at least in part, by seasonality in the stratospheric overturning circulation.

This study reveals that PWWP3A competes with TRAF6 for binding to VISA, impeding the recruitment of TBK1 and subsequent IRF3 activation, which prevents excessive immune responses. 
 VISA/MAVS is crucial in antiviral innate immunity. Upon RNA virus infection, VISA recruits TBK1 via TRAFs to mitochondria, inducing IRF3 phosphorylation and type I interferons. However, TBK1 recruitment mechanisms via individual TRAFs are unclear. Here, we reveal that PWWP domain-containing 3A (PWWP3A) serves as a negative regulator of RNA virus-triggered signaling. During viral infection, PWWP3A translocates from nucleus to the mitochondria, competing with TRAF6 for binding to VISA, thereby impeding the recruitment of TBK1 and inhibiting IRF3 activation. However, the extent of PWWP3A-mediated inhibition is regulated by the E3 ligase PJA2, which induces PWWP3A degradation post-infection, highlighting the intricate regulatory network in antiviral immunity. Consistently, PWWP3A deficiency enhances antiviral responses, and Pwwp3a−/− mice exhibit elevated levels of type I interferons and displayed greater resistance following RNA virus infection. Together, our findings unveil the inhibitory role of PWWP3A in virus-triggered signaling, which provides insights into preventing excessive immune responses.

Here, the authors show via molecular dynamics simulations that oscillatory deformations of the right frequency and amplitude can accelerate glassy dynamics, promoting molecular flow and damage repair. 
 Polymer glasses such as the plastics used in pipes, structural materials, and medical devices are ubiquitous in daily life. The nature of their low molecular mobility is still poorly understood and it leads to brittle mechanical behavior, damage, and fracture over time. It also prevents the design of self-healing mechanisms that expand the material’s lifespan, as more commonly done in recent years for higher mobility amorphous polymers such as gels and rubbers. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that controlled oscillatory deformations enhance the local molecular mobility of glassy polymers without compromising their structural or mechanical stability. We apply this principle to increase the molecular mobility around the surface of a cylindrical crack, counterintuitively inducing fracture repair and recovering the mechanical properties of the pristine material. Our findings are a first step to establish a general physical mechanism of self-healing in glasses that may inspire the design and processing of new glassy materials. Amorphous glassy materials do not usually heal damage spontaneously due to their low molecular mobility.

Here the authors test an intranasal subunit vaccine fused to albumin to facilitate FcRn-mediated trans-mucosal antigen transport and demonstrate protective immunity in mouse models. 
 Although vaccines are usually given intramuscularly, the intranasal delivery route may lead to better mucosal protection and limit the spread of respiratory virus while easing administration and improving vaccine acceptance. The challenge, however, is to achieve delivery across the selective epithelial cell barrier. Here we report on a subunit vaccine platform, in which the antigen is genetically fused to albumin to facilitate FcRn-mediated transport across the mucosal barrier in the presence of adjuvant. Intranasal delivery in conventional and transgenic mouse models induces both systemic and mucosal antigen-specific antibody responses that protect against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A. When benchmarked against an intramuscularly administered mRNA vaccine or an intranasally administered antigen fused to an alternative carrier of similar size, only the albumin-based intranasal vaccine yields robust mucosal IgA antibody responses. Our results thus suggest that this needle-free, albumin-based vaccine platform may be suited for vaccination against respiratory pathogens.

Here, the authors described the discovery of PVTX-405 as a potent, highly selective, and orally efficacious IKZF2 molecular glue degrader and their preclinical data support the clinical development of PVTX-405. 
 IKZF2 (Helios) is a transcription factor that is selectively expressed by Tregs and is essential for preserving the function and stability of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (TME), where it suppresses the anti-tumor immune response. Targeted IKZF2 degradation by small molecules represents a promising strategy for the development of a new class of cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we describe the discovery of PVTX-405, a potent, effective, highly selective, and orally efficacious IKZF2 molecular glue degrader. PVTX-405 degrades IKZF2 (DC50 = 0.7 nM and Dmax = 91%) while sparing other CRBN neo-substrates. Degradation of IKZF2 by PVTX-405 increases production of inflammatory cytokine IL-2 and reduces the suppressive activity of Tregs, leading to an increase in Teff cell proliferation. Once-daily oral administration of PVTX-405 as single agent significantly delays the growth of MC38 tumors in a syngeneic tumor model using humanized CRBN mice. PVTX-405 in combination with anti-PD1 or anti-LAG3 significantly increases animal survival compared to anti-PD1 or anti-LAG3 alone. Together, these results demonstrate that PVTX-405 is a promising IKZF2 degrader for clinical development for the treatment of human cancers.

Here, the authors show that LIS1 mutations increase stiffness in human brain organoids due to ECM alterations and that targeted ECM modulation restores mechanical properties. 
 The viscoelastic properties of tissues influence their morphology and cellular behavior, yet little is known about changes in these properties during brain malformations. Lissencephaly, a severe cortical malformation caused by LIS1 mutations, results in a smooth cortex. Here, we show that human-derived brain organoids with LIS1 mutation exhibit increased stiffness compared to controls at multiple developmental stages. This stiffening correlates with abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) expression and organization, as well as elevated water content, measured by diffusion-weighted MRI. Short-term MMP9 treatment reduces both stiffness and water diffusion levels to control values. Additionally, a computational microstructure mechanical model predicts mechanical changes based on ECM organization. These findings suggest that LIS1 plays a critical role in ECM regulation during brain development and that its mutation leads to significant viscoelastic alterations. Brain tissue mechanics influence development and disease. Here, the authors show that LIS1 mutations increase stiffness in human brain organoids due to ECM alterations and that targeted ECM modulation restores mechanical properties."

Here, Wang et al reveal that it interacts with the heat shock protein HSPB7 under biomechanical stress, forming a stable hetero-dimer which is regulated by phosphorylation. 
 The biomechanical properties and responses of tissues underpin a variety important of physiological functions and pathologies. In striated muscle, the actin-binding protein filamin C (FLNC) is a key protein whose variants causative for a wide range of cardiomyopathies and musculoskeletal pathologies. FLNC is a multi-functional protein that interacts with a variety of partners, however, how it is regulated at the molecular level is not well understood. Here we investigate its interaction with HSPB7, a cardiac-specific molecular chaperone whose absence is embryonically lethal. We find that FLNC and HSPB7 interact in cardiac tissue under biomechanical stress, forming a strong hetero-dimer whose structure we solve by X-ray crystallography. Our quantitative analyses show that the hetero-dimer out-competes the FLNC homo-dimer interface, potentially acting to abrogate the ability of the protein to cross-link the actin cytoskeleton, and to enhance its diffusive mobility. We show that phosphorylation of FLNC at threonine 2677, located at the dimer interface and associated with cardiac stress, acts to favour the homo-dimer. Conversely, phosphorylation at tyrosine 2683, also at the dimer interface, has the opposite effect and shifts the equilibrium towards the hetero-dimer. Evolutionary analysis and ancestral sequence reconstruction reveals this interaction and its mechanisms of regulation to date around the time primitive hearts evolved in chordates. Our work therefore shows, structurally, how HSPB7 acts as a specific molecular chaperone that regulates FLNC dimerisation. Filamin C is a key actin-binding protein involved in cardiomyopathies and musculoskeletal disorders. Here, Wang et al reveal that it interacts with the heat shock protein HSPB7 under biomechanical stress, forming a stable hetero-dimer which is regulated by phosphorylation."

Here the authors address this challenge by developing a catalytic shunt strategy. 
 Catalytic syngas conversion has the potential to improve the sustainability of chemical products. However, balancing high catalytic activity with selectivity is challenging because the complex interactions among intermediates across various active sites can trigger competing reactions. To address this challenge, we introduce a catalytic shunt strategy that redirects intermediates in a multifunctional catalytic system to guide interdependent reaction pathways. The key to this catalytic shunt strategy is modulating the adsorption of the intermediates across different activity domains. By tuning Mo–O coordination numbers of single atoms in a bifunctional catalyst, we achieve over 80% selectivity for aromatics and a carbon monoxide conversion surpassing 70%, with aromatics yields of over 40%. By absorbing the intermediates on the first activity domain, the shunt pathway prevents their participation in subsequent reactions, thereby boosting methane production with selectivity above 93% and carbon monoxide conversion exceeding 50%. This catalytic shunt strategy also showcases versatility across other bifunctional systems for producing gasoline and light olefins. Overall, this study provides a viable approach for tackling the activity–selectivity trade-off in catalytic syngas conversion, removing a major barrier preventing its practical implementation. Catalytic syngas conversion is an essential part of sustainable chemical production but is hindered by the trade-off between conversion activity and product selectivity.

This study explores the mechanisms behind compound MHW-TC events and their influence on the onset of the BoB summer monsoon (BoBSM). Our findings indicate that compound MHW-TC events initiate with increased downward shortwave radiation and Ekman downwelling during MHW formation, followed by latent heat flux release and Ekman upwelling during the TC lifecycle. The interaction between increased maximum potential intensity and steering flow during compound events results in a westward shift in TC tracks, delaying precipitation and atmospheric latent heat release in the eastern BoB. These factors, as well as the warmer sea surface temperatures in the BoB, hinder the reversal of the mid-to-upper tropospheric meridional temperature gradient, ultimately postponing BoBSM onset. These insights enhance the understanding of MHW-TC interactions and their implications for predicting BoBSM onset."

 Close-range LiDAR devices are considered to have great potential for enhancing forest inventory (FI) estimates. However, this potential is still being explored in the case of ground-based LiDAR devices, especially when the target is focused on relatively large spatial scales, such as stand level. This study explored the performance of close-range LiDAR devices in terms of bias and error, particularly terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) instruments, as measurement tools in stand-level FIs. The main premise of the research is that close-range LiDAR devices provide auxiliary information that can be used to accurately and precisely predict the dependent variable of the target population, thereby reducing errors. To this end, this study compared the performance of different statistical inference approaches that can be implemented with these technologies, such as the simple expansion estimator (EXP), two-stage model-assisted regression (REG), conventional model-based (CMB) and three-phase hierarchical model-based (3pHMB) approaches. These approaches were used to compare the following types of data: field measurements and TLS single-scan data (EXP, REG); field measurements and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-LiDAR data (CMB); and field measurements, TLS single-scan data and UAV-LiDAR data (3pHMB). The case study was carried out in a 16 ha experimental plot dominated by Pinus radiata and Pinus pinaster in northwest Spain, focusing on stand volume (V, m3 ha−1) estimates. The findings showed that the use of close-range remote sensing devices as a source of auxiliary data provided lower error in V estimates than the EXP approach using a single data source. The findings also suggest that close-range LiDAR devices can potentially be used as FI instruments. Therefore, the transfer of these sampling techniques may play an important role in operationalizing the use of close-range LiDAR devices in FIs."

 Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) serves as a crucial tool for monitoring vegetation characteristics and plays a vital role in terrestrial ecosystems. The vegetation optical depth dataset from AMSR-E/2 using multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA-AMSR VOD) possesses a longer time series spanning from 2002 to 2022. However, due to the limitations of satellite orbital scanning gap and retrieval algorithms, existing VOD datasets do not achieve complete coverage in global land. To address the need for a VOD dataset with high spatio-temporal coverage across different bands, we reconstruct the MCCA-AMSR VOD dataset using the 3D partial convolutional neural network. Three evaluation methods are employed to further assessthe reconstructed VOD dataset. The reconstructed VOD achieves a higher average spatial coverage (95.01 %) compared with the original dataset (72.55 %). The correlation coefficients (R) between original and reconstructed VOD dataset for all five simulated missing regions exceeded 0.99, indicating that the reconstructed VOD has a very high correlation with the original dataset at the regional scale. Furthermore, comparison with optical vegetation indices indicates that the reconstructed VOD can also capture vegetation water contentwell. Therefore, reconstructed VOD can provide valuable support for research on drought and vegetation monitoring."

 Existing building annotation methods require significant human resources or other costs, making it challenging to achieve both low cost and high efficiency simultaneously. Crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, with its extensive volume and openness, is widely used for annotation purposes. However, issues such as missing quality information and poor data completeness have hindered its potential to generate deep-learning samples. In this context, our research developed an automated method for generating high-quality building samples based on OSM and deep learning. To address the impact of poor OSM data completeness, we designed a Region-Of-Interest (ROI) generation algorithm to alleviate the negative impact of missing annotations during model training. Leveraging the superior performance of models specialized in the building extraction domain, we devised a method for selecting high-quality samples. Experimental results on the open-source simulation datasets WHU-SIM, MASS-SIM, and real environments in the San Angelo and Washington regions demonstrated the effectiveness of this method. We produced high-quality building samples with a resolution of 0.3 m for the San Angelo and Washington areas, enriching the available data in the building extraction field.

 Aerosol acidity plays a crucial role in atmospheric processes, impacting both environmental and human health. However, previous studies have not comprehensively quantified the pathways through which meteorological parameters and chemical components influence pH changes, particularly overlooking the role of non-ideality (γH+). In this study, we investigate the seasonal variation in aerosol acidity in an urban area of the Pearl River Delta, China, as a case to quantify the contributions of various pathways. We find that H+ concentration is the primary pathway for pH changes, contributing 64.2–81.3 %, followed by non-ideality, which accounts for 18.4–26.7 % and surpasses aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). Temperature affects pH mainly through H+ concentration variation, while relative humidity influences pH primarily via ALWC. Among chemical components, sulfate and ammonium (NH4+) impact pH through H+, while nitrate's influence is mainly driven by non-ideality. Excluding non-ideality shifts the fraction of NH4+ by as large as 48.5 %, underscoring the importance of considering non-ideality in gas-particle partitioning models. Lastly, ionic strength and nitrate fraction significantly influence the activity coefficient, highlighting the need to consider non-ideality when examining aerosol acidity processes."

 This paper statistically analyzes the spatio-temporal characteristics of multiple return strokes cloud-to-ground lightning (MRSCG) parameters in the land and offshore regions of Guangdong Province from 2014 to 2023, based on data from the Guangdong Lightning Location System. The results indicate that, although the proportion of MRSCG in the offshore region (45.66 %) is significantly higher than on land (33.46 %), the MRSCG flash density on land is greater, particularly in the Pearl River Delta region. The quantity of MRSCG exhibits a bimodal distribution, peaking in May–June and August. The daily peak occurs between 16:00 and 17:00 CST on land. The mean multiplicity of positive polarity MRSCG (PMRSCG) is comparable between the land (2.21) and offshore (2.22) regions. The mean multiplicity of negative polarity MRSCG (NMRSCG) is slightly higher in the offshore region (4.48) compared to the land region (4.21). The mean interstroke intervals of PMRSCG for the land and offshore regions are 123.9 ms and 125.26 ms, respectively, while those for NMRSCG are 93.2 ms and 95.16 ms, indicating minimal differences between land and offshore regions. Furthermore, the median peak current of MRSCG is higher in the offshore region, with the mean peak current reaching its maximum during the winter months. Finally, the characteristics of MRSCG in Guangdong Province are examined further by integrating the formation mechanisms of downward MRSCG along with the region's geographical and climatic conditions, and the failure risks of substation power equipment and wind turbines under MRSCG are assessed."

In this work, we identify formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) as a membrane receptor that specifically binds long-chain ceramides (C14 to C20). In brown and beige adipocytes, C16:0 ceramide binding to FPR2 inhibits thermogenesis through Gicyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathways, an effect that is reversed in the absence of FPR2. We present three cryo–electron microscopy structures of FPR2 in complex with Gitrimers bound to C16:0, C18:0, and C20:0 ceramides. The hydrophobic tails are deeply embedded in the orthosteric ligand pocket, which has a limited amount of plasticity.

Hutson;Ana Maria Rey;Jun Ye,Coherent evolution of superexchange interaction in seconds-long optical clock spectroscopy,"Scaling up the performance of atomic clocks requires understanding complex many-body Hamiltonians to ensure meaningful gains for metrological applications. Here we use a degenerate Fermi gas loaded into a three-dimensional optical lattice to study the effect of a tunable Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The clock laser introduces a spin-orbit coupling spiral phase and breaks the isotropy of superexchange interactions, leading to XXZ-type spin anisotropy. By tuning the lattice confinement and applying imaging spectroscopy, we map out favorable atomic coherence regimes. We transition through various interaction regimes and observe coherent superexchange, tunable through on-site interaction and site-to-site energy shift, affecting the Ramsey fringe contrast over timescales >1 second. This study lays the groundwork for using a three-dimensional optical lattice clock to probe quantum magnetism and spin entanglement."

Cohen;Michael Moshe;Eran Sharon,Geometrically frustrated rose petals,"Growth and form are deeply interconnected, in a manner often mediated by mechanical instabilities arising from geometric incompatibilities. Although Gauss incompatibility has long been recognized as the source of morphing in naturally growing slender organs, here we show that the growth profile of rose petals remains Gauss compatible. Their distinctive shape emerges from a different type of geometric incompatibility, the Mainardi-Codazzi-Peterson (MCP) incompatibility, which leads to the formation of localized cusps along the petal margins. We validated this mechanism in model disc petals theoretically, computationally, and experimentally. Our study reveals distinct morphological regimes, ranging from smooth edges to cusp-forming configurations, and demonstrates how stress focusing at cusps influences subsequent petal growth. These findings position MCP incompatibility as a generic mechanism for cusp formation in both natural and manmade self-morphing sheets."

By using participatory science data from eBird, we estimated continental population change and relative abundance at 27-kilometer resolution for 495 bird species from 2007 to 2021. Results revealed high and previously undetected spatial heterogeneity in trends; although 75% of species were declining, 97% of species showed separate areas of significantly increasing and decreasing populations. Populations tended to decline most steeply in strongholds where species were most abundant, yet they fared better where species were least abundant. These high-resolution trends improve our ability to understand population dynamics, prioritize recovery efforts, and guide conservation at a time when action is urgently needed."

Although the most promising realizations of quantum computers are based on various matter-qubit platforms, implementing blind quantum computing on matter qubits remains a challenge. Using silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in nanophotonic diamond cavities with an efficient optical interface, we demonstrated a universal quantum gate set consisting of single- and two-qubit blind gates over a distributed two-node network. Using these ingredients, we performed a distributed algorithm with blind operations across our two-node network, proving a route to develop blind quantum computation with matter qubits in distributed, modular architectures."

Their inherent ability to differentiate into other cell types has been the focus of investigation over decades. This ability is currently being exploited for therapies using strategies to repair or replace damaged tissues and cells or to alleviate immune rejection. Exploring stem cell function has enabled direct reprogramming approaches, for example, through the production of induced pluripotent stem cells and the generation of tissue-specific stem cells. Understanding stem cell function has emerged as an important strategy for repopulating stem cell pools or generating differentiated cells for therapy. Here, we review general principles of mammalian stem cell biology and cellular reprogramming approaches and their use for current and future therapeutic purposes."

Methods have been proposed to predict aggregation from sequence, but these have been trained and evaluated on small and biased experimental datasets. Here we directly address this data shortage by experimentally quantifying the aggregation of >100,000 protein sequences. This unprecedented dataset reveals the limited performance of existing computational methods and allows us to train CANYA, a convolution-attention hybrid neural network that accurately predicts aggregation from sequence. We adapt genomic neural network interpretability analyses to reveal CANYA’s decision-making process and learned grammar. Our results illustrate the power of massive experimental analysis of random sequence-spaces and provide an interpretable and robust neural network model to predict aggregation."

Despite being exhaustively studied, we found that a substantial part of the knowledge on their cranial musculature was mistaken. Eleven previously reported coelacanth “muscles” are nonexistent, while three previously unknown muscle subdivisions and connections are found. These findings markedly affect our understanding of the deep-time cranial evolution of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). Only 13% of the previously identified myological evolutionary novelties for the major gnathostome lineages proved to be accurate, but several new ones are proposed. We show that low, moderate, and high levels of cranial muscle innovation characterized the emergence of lobe-finned (sarcopterygian), cartilaginous (chondrichthyan), and ray-finned (actinopterygian) fishes, respectively. The novelties in the latter group resulted in the evolution of a second active mechanism for the expansion of the oropharyngeal cavity, which was probably crucial for the predominance of suction feeding versus bite feeding in extant actinopterygians."
