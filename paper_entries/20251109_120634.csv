10.1088/1748-9326/ae15aa,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注《巴黎协定》框架下国家自主贡献（NDCs）的最高可能雄心（HPA）的评估框架。它探讨了如何将HPA这一概念转化为实际行动，并提出了一个结构化的框架，该框架考虑了国内、国际和实施等因素，以评估NDCs的雄心水平。论文旨在支持透明的沟通，并促进对NDC准备工作的问责。虽然该论文与气候变化相关，但它主要侧重于政策、承诺和框架，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)', 'Paris Agreement', 'Climate Change Mitigation', 'Highest Possible Ambition (HPA)', 'Equity', 'Due diligence']",Julia Katharina Schönfeld;Joeri Rogelj,A framework to assess highest possible ambition in nationally determined contributions under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement,"Collective progress towards meeting the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal (LTTG) remains insufficient, a shortfall to be addressed by new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The Agreement stipulates that countries’ NDCs will represent a progression and reflect their highest possible ambition (HPA). However, the vague conceptualisation of this HPA norm challenges its translation into practice, allowing states to reference ambition in their NDC without clear evidence. Recently, the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) advisory opinion on climate change provided clarification regarding this norm. The level of ambition communicated in an NDC is not entirely left to the discretion of states but must constitute an adequate contribution to the collective achievement of the global temperature goal. States are obliged to exercise due diligence to ensure their NDCs reflect their best efforts. Building on the ICJ’s interpretative guidance, we propose a structured framework to operationalise the HPA norm and reflect upon considerations of ambition in countries’ NDCs. The framework’s core pillars incorporate domestic, international, and implementation considerations in NDCs, elaborated upon in two elements per pillar. Under domestic considerations, NDCs should be based on a faithful assessment of mitigation options utilising national capabilities. International considerations require contributions that adequately support the LTTG while balancing equity. Implementation considerations demand that NDCs account for the co-impact of the measures considered and be actionable in the near term to ensure ambition is translated into action. The Paris Agreement-HPA Framework can support transparent communication of the conditions under which more ambitious targets can be pursued. We apply the framework to explore the engagement of current NDCs with the framework’s elements. Finally, the framework empowers societal stakeholders to interrogate, verify and, when necessary, challenge whether NDC preparations were carried out with due diligence, supporting accountability in global and national climate action."
10.5194/acp-25-15197-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用大气反演技术，量化了2005年至2021年欧洲地区六氟化硫（SF6）的排放量。虽然该研究没有直接使用遥感技术或卫星观测，但它通过分析大气中SF6的浓度变化来反推排放源，这与大气成分分析密切相关。研究结果揭示了各国国家报告中对SF6排放量的低估，并强调了密集观测网络对提高反演可靠性的重要性。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术存在间接关联，特别是与空气质量监测和大气成分分析领域相关。,"['SF6 emissions', 'Greenhouse gas', 'Atmospheric inversion', 'Emission estimation', 'Air quality monitoring (indirectly)', 'Atmospheric composition (SF6 concentration)']",Martin Vojta;Andreas Plach;Rona L.

Emissions declined in most regions, likely due to EU F-gas regulations. However, our results reveal that most studied countries underestimate their emissions in their national reports. Our sensitivity tests highlight the importance of dense observational networks for reliable inversion-based emission estimates. 
 Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a highly potent and long-lived greenhouse gas whose atmospheric concentrations are increasing due to human emissions. In this study, we determine European SF6 emissions from 2005 to 2021 using a large ensemble of atmospheric inversions. To assess uncertainty, we systematically vary key inversion parameters across 986 sensitivity tests and apply a Monte Carlo approach to randomly combine these parameters in 1003 additional inversions. Our analysis focuses on high-emitting countries with robust observational coverage – UK, Germany, France, and Italy – while also examining aggregated EU-27 emissions.SF6 emissions declined across all studied regions except Italy, largely attributed to EU F-gas regulations (2006, 2014), however, national reports underestimated emissions: (i) UK emissions dropped from 68 (47–77) t yr−1 in 2008 to 19 (15–26) t yr−1 in 2018, aligning with the reports from 2018 onward; (ii) French emissions fell from 78 (51–117) t yr−1 (2005) to 35 (19–54) t yr−1 (2021), exceeding reports by 88 %; (iii) Italian emissions fluctuated (25–48 t yr−1), surpassing reports by 107 %; (iv) German emissions declined from 182 (155–251) t yr−1 (2005) to 97 (88–104) t yr−1 (2021), aligning reasonably well with reports; (v) EU-27 emissions decreased from 403 (335–501) t yr−1 (2005) to 225 (191–260) t yr−1 (2021), exceeding reports by 20 %. A substantial drop from 2017 to 2018 mirrored the trend in southern Germany, suggesting regional actions were taken as the 2014 EU regulation took effect.Our sensitivity tests highlight the crucial role of dense monitoring networks in improving inversion reliability. The UK system expansions (2012, 2014) significantly enhanced result robustness, demonstrating the importance of comprehensive observational networks in refining emission estimates."

Ice production is impacted by aerosols that either can form cloud droplets or ice crystals and processes that form ice crystals from pre-existing cloud particles. All those processes can interact and affect the electrical activity and differently according to the cloud conditions. 
 Ice particles play a crucial role in shaping cloud electrification, affecting the intensity of lightning activity. Previous studies have found a change of electric activity with varying aerosols concentration or active secondary ice production processes (SIP). However, the electric response to those parameters can differ with different cloud conditions and interact between themselves. The Meso-NH model was used with the two-moment microphysics scheme LIMA coupled with an explicit electrical scheme. Three idealized storms with varying warm-phase thicknesses were simulated to examine their response to aerosol concentrations and SIP mechanisms.Increasing the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) or the ice nucleating particle (INP) concentration increases ice crystal concentration, non-inductive charging and lightning activity up to a threshold. The main ice production processes (heterogeneous, homogeneous nucleation or Hallett-Mossop mechanism) depend on the cloud base temperature, and the aerosol concentration. CCN concentration thresholds (1000–8000 cm−3) differ across all storms due to cloud base temperature, while the threshold for INP concentration is generally ∼ 100 L−1. Higher CCN concentrations increase cloud water content, affecting charge polarity, but has a relatively limited impact on graupel mass.SIP mechanisms significantly enhance non-inductive charging and lightning activity by increasing ice crystal concentrations, particularly at low altitudes where primary ice production is inactive. This promotes ice-graupel collisions and amplifies charge exchange in each grid cell. The intensity of SIP processes varies with the thickness of the warm-phase region. Raindrop shattering freezing is the most sensitive and requires a deep warm-phase, while Hallett-Mossop and collisional ice break-up produce abundant ice crystals in all storms."

The mosaic is made harmonising and blending seven regional inventories, gapfilled with the most recent release of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. By incorporating the best available local information, the HTAP_v3.2 emission mosaic can be used for policy-relevant studies at regional and global level. 
 This study, performed under the umbrella of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF-HTAP), responds to the need of the global and regional atmospheric modelling community of having a mosaic emission inventory of air pollutants that conforms to specific requirements: global coverage, long time series, spatially distributed emissions with high time resolution, and a high sectoral resolution. The mosaic approach of integrating official regional emission inventories based on locally reported data, with a global inventory based on a globally consistent methodology, allows modellers to perform simulations of a high scientific quality while also ensuring that the results remain relevant to policymakers.HTAP_v3.2, an ad-hoc global mosaic of anthropogenic inventories, is an update to the HTAP_v3 global mosaic inventory and has been developed by integrating official inventories over specific areas (North America, Europe, Asia including China, Japan and Korea) with the independent Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) inventory for the remaining world regions. The results are spatially and temporally distributed emissions of SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, Black Carbon (BC), and Organic Carbon (OC), with a spatial resolution of 0.1 × 0.1° and time intervals of months and years covering the period 2000–2020 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17086684, Crippa, 2025, https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset_htap_v32, last access: 27 October 2025). The emissions are further disaggregated to 16 anthropogenic emitting sectors. This paper describes the methodology applied to develop such an emission mosaic, reports on source allocation, differences among existing inventories, and best practices for the mosaic compilation. One of the key strengths of the HTAP_v3.2 emission mosaic is its temporal coverage, enabling the analysis of emission trends over the past two decades. The development of a global emission mosaic over such long time series represents a unique product for global air quality modelling and for better-informed policy making, reflecting the community effort expended by the TF-HTAP to disentangle the complexity of transboundary transport of air pollution."

However, these processes do not always produce surface manifestations and may sometimes elude detection by current geological and geodetic monitoring. Here we monitor subsurface seismic velocity changes across Kīlauea's system from 2013 to 2018 and integrate these observations with concurrent measurements of ground deformation and lava lake elevation. We corroborate years‐long seismic velocity decreases around the summit caldera, which are particularly pronounced at southern stations, consistent with sustained pressurization of the South Caldera reservoir (SCR) from a deep magma supply. Following the 2015 summit intrusion, accelerated rates of velocity decrease, summit inflation, and lava lake rise suggest an increased magma supply to the SCR. Notably, we identify an anomalous 7‐month period (late 2016–mid 2017) of disrupted magma/pressure transfer between the SCR and Halema'uma'u magma reservoir (HMR), as evidenced by dropping lava lake levels despite continued summit inflation and SCR pressurization. This period coincided with pressurization observed beneath Pu'u'ō'ō, indicating pressure/magma diversion from the summit toward the ERZ and the episode terminated with a M5.3 flank earthquake in June 2017 that restored the connectivity between the SCR and HMR and triggered shallow crustal pressurization beneath the summit caldera for the subsequent 2–3 months. Our findings reveal significant perturbations in Kīlauea's magmatic plumbing system approximately one year before the catastrophic 2018 eruption, highlighting seismic velocity monitoring's value for detecting subtle changes of the volcano."

We then conducted two monthly simulations for Tibetan Plateau (TP) using the updated WRF model with the new drag scheme and that with orographic anisotropy for eight representative directions (8X) to validate the updated model against station observation and reanalysis data. The new scheme is shown to reduce the root‐mean‐square‐error (RMSE) in the upper‐level zonal wind speed (above 50 hPa) by 10%–20% in the north of the TP and by 5%–10% on the northern TP region. This is achieved by better representation of the orographic parameters that perturbed the launching gravity wave momentum flux from the surface and altered its breaking level aloft, thereby impacting the zonal wind vertically. The weakened drag over the west TP raised the breaking level and enhanced zonal wind below 100‐hPa while weakened zonal wind above; strengthened drag over the north of TP lowered the breaking level and weakened zonal wind below 50 hpa while enhance it above.

Starting from an approximation of planar circular motion and physical laws defining field generation from charged particles, a dust devil model is developed based upon observation and measurements. Simulated electromagnetic fields from a 7 m diameter event match measured fields. The only in situ measurements of electromagnetic fields within a dust devil record an electric field of −4.3 kVm−1 50 m from the center of the dust devil and a central magnetic field of 0.4 nT. Our simulation using 106 superparticles yields 0.16 nT at the center and −3.2 kVm−1 50 m distant, indicating that the model is effective. Analysis shows the results are most sensitive to poorly understood parameters, such as the grain size distribution through the height of the dust devil, and the azimuthal distribution of dust in the event. These are crucial areas for targeted future measurements. The model not only enables simulation of dust devils without supporting experimental data but also allows key properties to be inferred when point measurements are available, this is particularly important given the scarcity of experimental data. The simulation's modular structure means it is readily adapted to simulate dust devils with differing properties, in different environments, or when more experimental data become available."

However, the morphological spatial patterns of UGI and their impact on PM2.5 remain largely unexplored, as most related studies have focused solely on case studies. This study employed morphological spatial pattern analysis to document the national scale spatial distribution of seven UGI morphology space patterns (MSPs) across 288 Chinese cities. It verified the disparities of each MSP under varying geographic conditions and scalar categories. Using advanced interpretable machine learning methods that account for aggregated contribution of location features, the study confirmed the positive role of UGI proportion in mitigating PM2.5 levels. Significantly, the findings revealed that smaller non‐core UGI areas, such as perforation and islet, exert a more pronounced positive impact on reducing PM2.5.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of approaches used in event attribution studies for estimating the return periods of hot extremes based on large samples from large ensembles of climate model simulations. We found that, even with large sample sizes, annual maxima of temperature extremes do not fit well to a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution in the far right tail, leading to an overestimation of return period. However, the maxima of multi‐year blocks generally fit well to a GEV distribution, improving the accuracy of exceedance probability estimates for very rare events. For events with shorter return periods, such as those spanning tens of years or less, fitting annual maxima to a GEV distribution can generally still provide robust estimates. Additionally, estimates based on data samples of similar lengths to observational records are less reliable due to limited sample sizes. These findings highlight the need for caution when interpreting event attribution results for events with long return periods."

Accurately quantifying storm surge hazards is crucial for risk mitigation and climate adaptation. In this study, we conduct climatology‐hydrodynamic modeling to estimate TC surge hazards along the US northeast coastline under future climate scenarios. In this methodology, we generate synthetic TCs for the northeastern US to drive a hydrodynamic model (ADCIRC) to simulate storm surges. Observing their significant effect on storm surge, for the first time, we bias‐correct landfall angles of synthetic TCs, in addition to bias‐correcting their frequency and intensity. Our findings show that under the combined effects of sea level rise (SLR) and TC climatology change, historical 100‐year extreme water levels (EWLs) along the US northeast coastline would occur annually at the end of the century in both SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5 emissions scenarios. 500‐year EWLs are also projected to occur every 1–60 (1–20) years under SSP2‐4.5 (SSP5‐8.5). SLR is the dominant factor in the dramatic changes in the EWLs. However, while in higher latitudes (>40.5° ${ >} 40.5{}^{\circ}$) TC climatology change modestly affect EWLs (<10% ${< } 10\%$ contribution for 100‐year and <40% ${< } 40\%$for 500‐year EWL changes), in lower latitudes the impact is more significant (up to 40% contribution to 100‐year and 55% for 500‐year EWL changes). Extending previous methods, the physics‐based probabilistic framework presented here can be applied to project future coastal flood hazards under the effects of SLR and storm climatology change for any TC‐prone region."

This study shows that anthropogenic warming now has greater influence than the PDO on North Pacific sea surface temperatures, with implications for predictability and impacts. 
 The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has served as a key index linking basin-scale climate variability to marine ecosystem changes in the North Pacific. However, recent apparent breakdowns of PDO–ecosystem correlations have raised concerns about the stability of the mode and its continued relevance in a warming climate. Here we show that basin-wide warming now overwhelms PDO-related sea surface temperature (SST) variability, although neither the PDO’s spatial pattern nor its strength have changed. We introduce the pan-basin pattern as a complementary index to describe the non-stationary SST baseline of the North Pacific. Regional SSTs increasingly reflect the superposition of these two signals, providing an explanation for weakened or inverted PDO–ecosystem correlations. Future use of the PDO index in management will require discerning the effects of internal dynamics from those of absolute changes in SST as extreme and no-analogue ocean conditions driven by interacting natural variability and anthropogenic warming become more common.

 Streetlights are essential infrastructure in cities. They enhance traffic and public safety at night, but they also entail significant energy consumption. The study of the density, quantity and distribution of streetlights is essential for sustainable urban development. The Sustainable Development Global Scientific Satellite-1 has enriched night-time light data. This study is based on the Crowded Scene Recognition Network (CSRNet) and proposes a novel Streetlight Counting Network (SLCNet) by introducing a deeper front-end network and adding a spatial attention mechanism. This model can effectively estimate the density distribution of streetlights within a region and achieve automatic counting of large-scale streetlight numbers. Experimental results show that SLCNet achieves a mean absolute error of 135.35, a root mean square error of 231.37, and a normalised absolute error of 0.22, representing reductions of 5.60 %, 8.08 %, and 12.00 % respectively outperforming the original CSRNet model. The visualisation results also show that SLCNet predicts the distribution of streetlight density more accurately than CSRNet. Comprehensive ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each improvement method. Compared with the high-resolution yet costly Jilin-1 night-time images, SLCNet maintains comparable accuracy while enabling large-scale streetlight density and quantity estimation with publicly accessible SDGSAT-1 images. This study demonstrates the application potential of SDGSAT-1 in urban night-time lighting monitoring, providing new technical pathways and research frameworks for urban lighting management, sustainable development assessment, and smart city construction."

 The increase of surface solar radiation (SSR) observed during the last decades in Europe has raised concerns for its implications for the climate system. Here, we evaluate the past and projected SSR trends in Europe from 1994 to 2054 based on a comprehensive set of ground site observations, five historical gridded datasets and a remarkable ensemble of 30 CMIP6 climate models with projections in four different forcing scenarios. Together, they provide a seamless unprecedented characterisation of the SSR trend in Europe across time and space. The regional SSR trend observed in the period 1994–2023 is 3.1 W/m2/decade. All gridded datasets, except the ERA5 reanalysis, deviate from this value by ±0.3 W/m2/decade, or less. Assuming that clouds and aerosols are the only boosters of the SSR trend, it is found that ≈20% of the trend is explained by aerosol direct effect (ADE). It is shown that the first aerosol indirect effect (AIE) alone cannot explain the SSR trend related to cloud changes, thus leaving a significant role for changes in cloud coverage. It is estimated that the total SSR trend is approximately explained in 1/5 by ADE, 2/5 by first AIE and 2/5 by cloud coverage changes. However, this fractions are likely affected by biases in aerosol optical depth. The results suggest that the CMIP6 ensemble overestimates (underestimates) the clear (cloudy) SSR trend during 1994–2014. The median SSR trend projected by the CMIP6 models is, on average, ≈85% smaller than the trend observed during 1994–2023 with small differences between forcings scenarios."

 Climate-driven increases in wildfire frequency threaten forest resilience in fire-prone ecosystems. Although short-term studies indicate rapid recovery of eucalypt forests, such assessments may be overly optimistic, given the uncertain long-term alignment of structural and functional trajectories. This study integrated multi-source remote sensing data (2000−2020) with eddy covariance flux measurements to quantify post-fire recovery dynamics of eucalypt forests in southeastern Australia. We analyzed key structural metrics, including fraction of tree cover (FTC), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and leaf area index (LAI), as well as functional traits, including gross primary productivity (GPP), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), evapotranspiration (ET), fuel moisture content (FMC), and vegetation optical depth (VOD). On average, all these traits recovered to pre-fire levels within 5.5 to 7.5 years, though some areas required over a decade or more. Recovery trajectories diverged notably both between the structural and functional categories and among individual traits within each category. These recovery rates varied across forest groups, modulated by disturbance severity, understory compositions, and fire frequency. Notably, functional traits such as GPP and SIF recovered rapidly, surpassing even the fastest structural metrics. At the Wallaby Creek flux site (burned in 2009 and rebuilt), GPP and SIF exhibited a distinct “peak-decline-stabilize” pattern, surpassing pre-fire levels within three years before declining as LAI recovered. In contrast, structural metrics recovered gradually, with LAI lagging behind FTC and NDVI. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating multi-dimensional data to comprehensively assess forest recovery, offering critical insights for ecosystem management and carbon cycle modeling in fire-prone regions."

 Child malnutrition continues to be a significant public health issue in Indonesia, with considerable spatial variations among provinces. This study utilizes an integrated framework that combines Bayesian Network (BN) modeling, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), and Moran’s I analysis to ascertain the principal determinants of child nutritional status and their spatial distribution. The Bayesian Network (BN) probabilistic approach captures intricate interdependencies among health and behavioral factors, such as Correct Knowledge about Stunting (CKS), Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF), Breastfeeding for Two Years (BF2Y), Complementary Feeding (CF), Immunization (IMM), Growth Monitoring (GM), Iron-Folic Acid Supplementation (IFA), Antenatal Care (ANC6), and Animal Protein Intake for Pregnant Women (APH), and their impact on outcomes classified as Severely Underweight (SUW), Underweight (UW), and Normal (N). Spatial statistical analyses indicate considerable heterogeneity and elevated-risk clusters of malnutrition, underscoring areas necessitating prioritized interventions. Stochastic simulations elucidate the variability and robustness of critical determinants, whereas model evaluation via Mean Squared Error (MSE) indicates robust predictive performance for variables such as N, ANC6, and SUW, with heightened uncertainty noted for EBF, IFA, and IMM, implying the impact of supplementary social or contextual factors.

 Precise reconstruction of lunar south pole’s terrain is crucial for future exploration missions, particularly for landing site selection, resource identification, and scientific research. However, the challenging illumination conditions, characterized by extensive shadowed areas, pose significant challenges to traditional photogrammetric methods. The shadowed areas lead to poor disparity estimation and less accurate terrain models, highlighting the need for improved techniques that can effectively address these difficult conditions. This study proposes an enhanced dense matching method for terrain reconstruction at lunar south pole, which incorporates prior information of existing lower-resolution terrain model to guide the semi-global matching (SGM) process. We begin by adaptively selecting seed points in shadowed areas of the image through intensity histogram analysis. Homogeneous pixels with close spatial distance and small intensity difference surrounding each seed point are then identified based on distance and intensity differences. After obtaining prior disparity values, the corresponding costs are simulated and combined with matching costs from the original 2D disparity search SGM algorithm, optimizing pixel costs to refine the cost volume and improve the robustness of the matching process. Experiments were conducted in representative areas of lunar south pole to validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, the performance of our method is compared with SGM variants and two advanced cost volume optimization methods, further demonstrating its effectiveness. Finally, we apply our method to several pairs of LROC NAC images to generate detailed terrain models at lunar south pole, quantitatively validating its reliability through comparisons with reference terrain data and LOLA laser points."

 The long-term trend for aerosol optical properties and climate impact sensitivity in terms of radiative forcing efficiency were analyzed at a suburban station in Athens, Southeast Mediterranean, using an extensive dataset from 2008 to 2022. The study examined scattering (σsc) and absorption (σap) coefficients, scattering Ångström exponent (SAE), absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), single scattering albedo (SSA), asymmetry parameter (g), and radiative forcing efficiency (RFE). Seasonal variability was linked to meteorological conditions and human activities. Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) was lowest (0.86), and Radiative Forcing Efficiency (RFE) was highest (−61 W/m2) in winter, confirming enhanced contributions from traffic and biomass burning. Lower SAE values (1.5) in spring indicate a greater presence of coarse particles due to frequent Saharan dust events (SDEs). Daily patterns of σap and SSA reflect local emissions, with pronounced traffic-related peaks. Aerosol classification revealed that Black Carbon (BC) dominates the suburban aerosol (51 %), with mixed BrC-BC (16 %) peaking in winter and dust-pollution mixtures (13 %) increasing in spring. The presence of large particles mixed with BC (11 %) was more frequent in spring, further highlighting seasonal variability. Trend analysis showed statistically significant (ss) decreases in σsc (−0.611) and SSA (−0.003), alongside increases in σap (+0.027) and RFE (+0.270) at a 95 % confidence level, suggesting a shift toward more absorbing aerosols. The findings provide new insights and reveal a new aerosol regime, where a reduction in anthropogenic emissions is affecting the scattering rather than the absorbing aerosol component, while the impact from forest fires as a climate feedback mechanism has a significant effect in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is important for future studies and climate modelling to account for the regionally observed changes of the state of mixing of ambient aerosol leading to a shift in radiative forcing efficiency through the reduction in SSA. This is evident in the long term for the east Mediterranean region and must be accounted for in radiative forcing estimates and future climate projections."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108593,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注中国北京PM2.5中硝酸盐的十年变化趋势。它通过地面实时观测、气象归一化和源解析来研究硝酸盐的浓度变化，并分析了排放控制政策的影响。虽然与大气成分有关，但该研究主要依赖于地面观测数据和统计分析，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['PM2.5', 'Nitrate', 'Air Quality', 'Emission Control', 'Meteorological Normalization', 'Source Identification']",Zelin Du;Xiaojuan Xu;Ruihuan Liu;Jun He;Yu Liu;Erhong Duan;Yuesi Wang;Dongsheng Ji,"Decadal variability of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-associated nitrate in the megacity of Beijing, China: Revelations achieved through continuous real-time in-situ observation","•A 10-year hourly measurement of NO3−in PM2.5was made in urban Beijing. •Stringent emission controls drove a 4.8 % annual decline from 2013 to 2022. •Emission reductions drove 78.4 % of the decline, v.s. 21.6 % for meteorology. •Persistent NO₃−reduction challenges emerged from southern source regions. 
 Atmospheric nitrate (NO₃−), a key component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), significantly impacts air quality and climate. This study investigates decadal variability (2013−2022) of PM2.5-associated NO₃− in Beijing using continuous real-time measurements, meteorological normalization, and source identification. Results reveal an annual NO₃− decline of 4.8 %, driven by stringent clean air policies like “coal-to-gas” initiatives, with autumn and winter reductions (−8.6 %/yr and − 8.4 %/yr, respectively) outpacing other seasons due to targeted emission controls. Despite progress, NO₃− remains elevated (11.7 ± 15.8 μg/m3), contributing 33.0 % to PM2.5 by 2022, underscoring persistent secondary formation under high oxidation capacity. Diurnal patterns show high nocturnal and morning values (shallow boundary layers and traffic emissions) and minima at 16:00–18:00 (volatilization and deep boundary layers), while absent weekend effects reflect unregulated traffic and sustained residential activity. Meteorological normalization attributes 78.4 % of NO₃− decline to emission controls, emphasizing policy efficacy, yet chemical feedbacks (enhanced NOₓ-to-HNO₃ conversion) and transboundary transport challenge further mitigation. The interplay between local emissions and regional transport significantly shaped the variability of PM2.5-associated NO3− in Beijing from 2013 to 2022. The nonparametric wind regression analyses identify northwest and southern hotspots, with shifting source regions post-2018 highlighting growing contributions from southern industrial zones. Based on the potential source contribution function and concentration weighted trajectory methods, it can be found that dominant source regions of NO3− and its precursor (NOₓ) were located south of Beijing. Findings advocate interaction of policy, chemistry, and meteorology in shaping PM2.5 composition, integrated NH₃-NOₓ controls and regional coordination, offering critical insights for optimizing air quality strategies in rapidly urbanizing regions globally."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108614,False,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文主要关注的是利用机器学习算法来预测长江中下游地区的夏季极端降水日数。研究使用了XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost等先进的机器学习模型，并结合Spearman相关性和物理机制筛选出的关键预测因子，构建了一个集成模型。该模型在预测极端降水日数方面表现优于传统的季节性预测方法。此外，研究还利用SHAP分析识别了欧亚积雪深度异常和热带大西洋海表温度异常等主要驱动因素，并揭示了预测因子之间的非线性关系。总的来说，该研究旨在提高极端降水事件的季节性预测能力，并为未来的预测改进提供有价值的机制理解，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,"['Extreme Precipitation', 'Seasonal Forecasting', 'Machine Learning', 'Climate Prediction', 'Eurasian Snow Depth', 'Tropical Atlantic SST']",Chunyan Xiao;Anmin Duan;Yuheng Tang;Bin Tang;Qilu Wang;Xianyi Yang,Machine learning prediction of summer extreme precipitation days in the middle and lower Yangtze River with SHAP explanation,"•Used XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost to predict extreme summer rainfall days in the middle–lower Yangtze River basin. •Machine learning prediction scheme performs better than traditional seasonal forecasting methods. •SHAP analysis finds key nonlinear predictors: Eurasian snow depth and tropical Atlantic SST anomalies. 
 Accurately predicting summer extreme precipitation days in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (YREPD) is critical for disaster mitigation yet remains challenging. This study introduces three advanced machine-learning algorithms—Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)—to enhance seasonal forecasts of the leading mode of YREPD. Key predictors from preceding-season observational datasets were rigorously selected based on Spearman's rank correlation and physical mechanisms. Their ensemble achieves a temporal correlation coefficient (TCC) of 0.73 (P < 0.05) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 on test data. Compared to the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model (TCC = 0.59, RMSE = 0.99), the ensemble increases TCC by 23.7 % and reduces RMSE by 12.1 %. Moreover, the ensemble model significantly outperforms traditional multiple linear regression as well as persistence and climate baseline approaches. Furthermore, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis identifies Eurasian snow depth anomalies and tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies as dominant drivers. Crucially, the SHAP analysis uncovers prevalent nonlinear predictor relationships and significant predictor interactions, providing novel physical insights into YREPD variability. This work demonstrates the enormous potential of machine learning ensembles for advancing seasonal extreme precipitation prediction and provides valuable mechanistic understanding for future forecasting improvements."

 Tropical cyclones and frontal systems are two primary weather systems influencing East Asia. Distinguishing between typhoon rainfall (TR) and non-typhoon rainfall (non-TR) and analyzing their divergent changes are essential for exploring extreme rainfall evolution. Existing related researches remain limited and have primarily focused on a single timescale (annual or seasonal), overlooking characteristics across other timescales. Fujian was selected as a typical case due to its distinctive geographic environment. This study adopted total rainfall and maximum daily rainfall to compare long-term trends of typhoon-related extreme rainfall (TER) and non-typhoon-related extreme rainfall (non-TER) across multiple timescales and their spatial patterns. There were divergent timescale effects in trends of TER and non-TER in Fujian (1961–2021). While no significant trends are found at annual and typhoon-season scales, TER showed a significant increasing trend for August. In contrast, non-TER displayed a significant upward trend for typhoon season, but not at other timescales. Temporally, concentrated typhoon frequency and increased typhoon linger time in August were primary drivers of the significant TER increase during same period. Spatially, the combined influences of terrain and typhoon tracks resulted in a greater relative increase in August TER in the western region than the eastern region, creating a distinct west-east divergence: significant increases in the west contrasted with minimal changes in the east. By distinguishing between TR and non-TR, analyzing regional extreme rainfall variability offers a newer insight into its evolution under distinct weather systems across East Asia."
