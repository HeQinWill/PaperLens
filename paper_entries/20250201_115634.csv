10.5194/acp-25-1353-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了ERA5再分析资料和CMIP6气候模式对中高纬度地区地表降雪和云相的模拟能力，并利用CloudSat-CALIPSO卫星观测资料进行了评估。结果发现，ERA5和CMIP6都高估了过冷液态云和降雪的频率，这可能是由于云微物理参数化方案的差异造成的。该研究强调改进气候模式中云微物理参数化方案的重要性，以便更准确地模拟云相和降雪，从而提高气候预测的可靠性。研究中使用了多种大气环境遥感技术，包括卫星观测（CloudSat-CALIPSO）和再分析资料（ERA5），对大气成分（云相，过冷液态云）和气候模拟进行了分析，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['CloudSat', 'CALIPSO', 'satellite observations', 'supercooled liquid-containing clouds (sLCCs)', 'snowfall', 'cloud phase', 'climate models', 'ERA5', 'CMIP6', 'atmospheric composition', 'cloud microphysics', 'climate projections']",Franziska Hellmuth;Tim Carlsen;Anne Sophie Daloz;Robert Oscar David;Haochi Che;Trude Storelvmo,Evaluation of biases in mid-to-high-latitude surface snowfall and cloud phase in ERA5 and CMIP6 using satellite observations,"This article compares the occurrence of supercooled liquid-containing clouds (sLCCs) and their link to surface snowfall in CloudSat–CALIPSO, ERA5, and the CMIP6 models. Significant discrepancies were found, with ERA5 and CMIP6 consistently overestimating sLCC and snowfall frequency. This bias is likely due to cloud microphysics parameterization. This conclusion has implications for accurately representing cloud phase and snowfall in future climate projections. 
 Supercooled liquid-containing clouds (sLCCs) play a significant role in Earth's radiative budget and the hydrological cycle, especially through surface snowfall production. Evaluating state-of-the-art climate models with respect to their ability to simulate the frequency of occurrence of sLCCs and the frequency with which they produce snow is, therefore, critically important. Here, we compare these quantities as derived from satellite observations, reanalysis datasets, and Earth system models from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and find significant discrepancies between the datasets for mid- and high latitudes in both hemispheres. Specifically, we find that the ERA5 reanalysis and 10 CMIP6 models consistently overestimate the frequency of sLCCs and snowfall frequencies from sLCCs compared to CloudSat–CALIPSO satellite observations. The biases are very similar for ERA5 and the CMIP6 models, which indicates that the discrepancies in cloud phase and snowfall stem from differences in the representation of cloud microphysics rather than the representation of meteorological conditions. This, in turn, highlights the need for refinements in the models’ parameterizations of cloud microphysics in order for them to represent cloud phase and snowfall accurately. The thermodynamic phase of clouds and precipitation has a strong influence on simulated climate feedbacks and, thus, projections of future climate. Understanding the origin(s) of the biases identified here is, therefore, crucial for improving the overall reliability of climate models."
10.5194/acp-25-1333-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了矿物尘对全球硝酸盐气溶胶辐射强迫的影响。研究发现，由于气溶胶-辐射相互作用和云调整，矿物尘对硝酸盐气溶胶的辐射强迫产生了区域性的正负影响。全球平均净辐射强迫分别为-0.11和+0.17 W m−2。该研究使用了全球大气化学和气候模型EMAC以及热力学平衡模型ISORROPIA-lite进行模拟，考虑了矿物尘成分和排放量的影响。结果表明，硝酸盐气溶胶的直接效应导致全球变冷，而间接效应导致全球变暖。这与硝酸盐气溶胶与矿物尘粒子的相互作用，以及对云凝结核的影响有关。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到大气成分分析（硝酸盐气溶胶和矿物尘）、气溶胶辐射强迫的计算以及对气候变化的影响评估，这些都需要依赖于卫星观测和地面空气质量监测数据来进行验证和补充。,"['Nitrate aerosol', 'Mineral dust', 'Radiative effect', 'Aerosol-radiation interaction', 'Cloud adjustment', 'Global climate model', 'Satellite observation', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis']",Alexandros Milousis;Klaus Klingmüller;Alexandra P. Tsimpidi;Jasper F. Kok;Maria Kanakidou;Athanasios Nenes;Vlassis A. Karydis,Impact of mineral dust on the global nitrate aerosol direct and indirect radiative effect,"This study investigates the impact of dust on the global radiative effect of nitrate aerosols. The results indicate both positive and negative regional shortwave and longwave radiative effects due to aerosol–radiation interactions and cloud adjustments. The global average net REari and REaci of nitrate aerosols are −0.11 and +0.17 W m−2, respectively, mainly affecting the shortwave spectrum. Sensitivity simulations evaluated the influence of mineral dust composition and emissions on the results. 
 Nitrate (NO3-) aerosol is projected to increase dramatically in the coming decades and may become the dominant inorganic particle species. This is due to the continued strong decrease in SO2 emissions, which is not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in NOx and especially NH3 emissions. Thus, the radiative effect (RE) of NO3- aerosol may become more important than that of SO42- aerosol in the future. The physicochemical interactions of mineral dust particles with gas and aerosol tracers play an important role in influencing the overall RE of dust and non-dust aerosols but can be a major source of uncertainty due to their lack of representation in many global climate models. Therefore, this study investigates how and to what extent dust affects the current global NO3- aerosol radiative effect through both radiation (REari) and cloud interactions (REaci) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). For this purpose, multiyear simulations nudged towards the observed atmospheric circulation were performed with the global atmospheric chemistry and climate model EMAC, while the thermodynamics of the interactions between inorganic aerosols and mineral dust were simulated with the thermodynamic equilibrium model ISORROPIA-lite. The emission flux of the mineral cations Na+, Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+ is calculated as a fraction of the total aeolian dust emission based on the unique chemical composition of the major deserts worldwide. Our results reveal positive and negative shortwave and longwave radiative effects in different regions of the world via aerosol–radiation interactions and cloud adjustments. Overall, the NO3- aerosol direct effect contributes a global cooling of −0.11 W m−2, driven by fine-mode particle cooling at short wavelengths. Regarding the indirect effect, it is noteworthy that NO3- aerosol exerts a global mean warming of +0.17 W m−2. While the presence of NO3- aerosol enhances the ability of mineral dust particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), it simultaneously inhibits the formation of cloud droplets from the smaller anthropogenic particles. This is due to the coagulation of fine anthropogenic CCN particles with the larger nitrate-coated mineral dust particles, which leads to a reduction in total aerosol number concentration. This mechanism results in an overall reduced cloud albedo effect and is thus attributed as warming."

The observed 3.5-fold increase in ice concentrations between 1750 and 1990 CE is in good agreement with estimated past dominant ammonia emissions from agriculture, mainly from south European Russia and Türkiye. In contrast to present-day conditions, the ammonium level observed in 1750 CE indicates significant natural emissions at that time. 
 Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) is a key transboundary air pollutant that contributes to the impacts of nitrogen and acidity on terrestrial ecosystems. Ammonia also contributes to the atmospheric aerosol that affects air quality. Emission inventories indicate that NH3 was predominantly emitted by agriculture over the 19th and 20th centuries but, up to now, these estimates have not been compared to long-term observations. To document past atmospheric NH3 pollution in south-eastern Europe, ammonium (NH4+) was analysed along an ice core extracted from Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus, Russia. The NH4+ ice-core record indicates a 3.5-fold increase in concentrations between 1750 and 1990 CE. Remaining moderate prior to 1950 CE, the increase then accelerated to reach a maximum in 1989 CE. Comparison between ice-core trends and estimated past emissions using state-of-the-art atmospheric transport modelling of submicron-scale aerosols (FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion) model) indicates good agreement with the course of estimated NH3 emissions from south-eastern Europe since ∼ 1750 CE, with the main contributions from south European Russia, Türkiye, Georgia, and Ukraine. Examination of ice deposited prior to 1850 CE, when agricultural activities remained limited, suggests an NH4+ ice concentration related to natural soil emissions representing ∼ 20 % of the 1980–2009 CE NH4+ level, a level mainly related to current agricultural emissions that almost completely outweigh biogenic emissions from natural soil. These findings on historical NH3 emission trends represent a significant contribution to the understanding of ammonia emissions in Europe over the last 250 years."

Kleindienst;Julio Torres;Ewa Bulska;Witold Danikiewicz;Rafal Szmigielski,"Atmospheric oxidation of 1,3-butadiene: influence of seed aerosol acidity and relative humidity on SOA composition and the production of air toxic compounds","Recent research has established the contribution of 1,3-butadiene (13BD) to organic aerosol formation with negative implications for urban air quality. Health effect studies have focused on whole particulate matter, but compounds responsible for adverse health effects remain uncertain. This study provides the effect of relative humidity and seed aerosol acidity on the chemical composition of aerosol formed from 13BD photooxidation. 
 This study investigated the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the chemical composition of gas and particle phases formed from the photooxidation of 1,3-butadiene (13BD) in the presence of NOx under acidified and non-acidified seed aerosol. The experiments were conducted in a 14.5 m3 smog chamber operated in a steady-state mode. Products were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. More than 50 oxygenated products were identified, including 33 oxygenated organics, 10 organosulfates (OSs), PAN, APAN, glyoxal, formaldehyde, and acrolein. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass and reaction products formed depended on RH and on the acidity of the seed aerosol. Based on the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM), the seed aerosol originated from the acidified and non-acidified solutions was found to exist under aqueous and solid phases, respectively. Although the terms “acidified” and “non-acidified” are true for the solutions from which the seeds were atomized, there are far more fundamental differences between the phase states in which species partition to or from (aqueous/solid), which considerably affects their partitioning and formation mechanisms. SOA mass and most SOA products (i) were higher under acidified seed conditions, where the aerosol particles were deliquescent, than under non-acidified seed conditions, where the aerosol particles did not contain any aqueous phase; (ii) increased with the acidity of the aerosol aqueous phase in the experiments under acidified seed conditions; and (iii) decreased with increasing RH. Glyceric acid, threitols, threonic acids, four dimers, three unknowns, and four organosulfates were among the main species measured under either acidified or non-acidified conditions across all RH levels. Total secondary organic carbon and carbon yield decreased with increasing RH under both acidified and non-acidified seed conditions. The photochemical reactivity of 13BD in our systems decreased with increasing RH and was faster under non-acidified than acidified seed conditions. To determine the contribution of 13BD products to ambient aerosol, we analyzed PM2.5 samples collected at three European monitoring stations located in Poland. The occurrence of several 13BD SOA products (e.g., glyceric acid, tartronic acid, threonic acid, tartaric acid, and OSs) in the field samples suggests that 13BD could contribute to ambient aerosol formation."

Walker,Hemispheric asymmetry in recent stratospheric age of air changes,"The transport rate of air in the stratosphere has changed in response to human emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances. This transport rate can be approximated using measurements of long-lived trace gases. We use observations and model results to derive anomalies and trends in the mean rate of stratospheric air transport. We find that air in the Northern Hemisphere aged by up to 0.3 years per decade relative to air in the Southern Hemisphere over 2004–2017. 
 Many stratospheric trace gases, including O3, HCl, and NOy, have had opposing trends in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) compared to the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the last 2 decades. Some of this difference is due to hemispherically asymmetric changes in the rate of transport by the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC), and some is due to ozone depletion and recovery. The mean age of air (AoA) is a common proxy for the transport rate by the BDC in models; however it cannot be directly measured. We use observations from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) along with results from the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) to derive AoA anomalies and AoA trends. The AoA is derived using observations of N2O, CH4, and CFC-12, all long-lived trace gases with tropospheric sources. We also consider CLaMS simulations driven with four different reanalyses (ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, MERRA-2). We find that, irrespective of which trace gas or reanalysis is used, air in the NH aged by up to 0.3 years per decade relative to the SH over 2004–2017. The maximum hemispheric difference in aging occurs in the middle stratosphere, near 30 hPa (∼ 24 km). We also show that the aging rate in the NH becomes smaller when the analysis is extended to 2021. The observed aging in the NH middle stratosphere contradicts model predictions of a decrease in stratospheric AoA in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. However, the smaller aging rate during 2004–2021 compared to 2004–2017 provides some evidence that the NH aging is impacted by decadal variability and the limited length of the observation period."

Previous measurements dating back to 2010 have been re-calibrated and an improved optimal estimation retrieval performed on these measurements, giving a 13-year dataset. Measurements made with new and improved instrumental hardware are used to correct previous measurements, which show better agreement than the non-corrected dataset. 
 Long-term observations of water vapour in the middle atmosphere are important for climate studies and predictions, chemical and dynamical process studies, and modelling certain weather events with implications for surface conditions. Measurements from an instrument making middle-atmosphere water vapour observations near Bern, Switzerland – named MIAWARA (MIddle Atmosphere WAter vapour RAdiometer) – have been completely reprocessed since 2010. This has comprised of a new calibration which has been integrated into the framework for the calibration of other University of Bern radiometers and a new retrieval algorithm. The installation of a new spectrometer on the instrument has also allowed the comparison and correction of past observations. We present these corrected measurements and their subsequent analysis against data from Aura's Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). The comparison shows that the corrected spectra yield more consistent values of water vapour mixing ratio between MIAWARA and Aura MLS, with a lower standard deviation of differences at all heights and a  reduced bias between the two instruments at pressure (height) levels below (above) 0.3 hPa."

We bring these data into a harmonized framework available through an online Climate Risks Embers Explorer. Without high levels of adaptation, most risks reach a high level around 2 to 2.3 °C of global warming. Improvements in future reports could include systematic collection of explanatory information and broader coverage of regions and adaptation. 
 The completion of the Sixth Assessment Cycle of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a unique opportunity to understand where the world stands on climate-change-related risks to natural and human systems at the global level, as well as for specific regions and sectors. Since its Third Assessment Report (AR3), released 2 decades ago, the IPCC has developed a synthetic representation of how risks increase with global warming, with risk levels reflected by the colours used, including shades of yellow and red, which led to the nickname “burning embers”. While initially designed to illustrate five overarching Reasons for Concern, these diagrams have been progressively applied to risks in specific systems and regions over the last 10 years. However, the information gathered through expert elicitation and the resulting quantitative risk assessments have hitherto remained scattered within and across reports and specific data files. This paper overcomes this limitation by developing a database containing all embers from AR3 to AR6 and an associated online “Climate Risks Embers Explorer” (CREE) to facilitate the exploration of the assessed risks. The data are also available in an archive file in a widely accessible format (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12626976, Marbaix et al., 2024). Important aspects of data homogenization are discussed, and an approach to structuring information on assessed risk increases is presented. Potential uses of the data are explored through aggregated analyses of risks and adaptation benefits, which show that, excluding high-adaptation cases, half of the assessed risk levels increase from a moderate risk to a high risk between 1.5 and 2 to 2.3 °C of global warming, a result which is consistent with the separate assessment of the Reasons for Concern by the IPCC. The database lays the groundwork for future risk assessments and the development of burning embers by providing a standardized baseline of risk data. It also highlights important areas for improvement in the forthcoming Seventh Assessment Cycle of the IPCC, particularly towards the systematic, homogeneous, and structured collection of information on illustrated risk increases; comprehensive coverage of impacted regions; a systematic consideration of adaptation and/or vulnerability levels; and, possibly, the coverage of risks from response measures. In the context of an ever-growing body of literature and knowledge, the facility described herein has the potential to help in synthesizing and illustrating risks across scales and systems in a more consistent and comprehensive way."

Streamflow is estimated through a state-of-the-art hydrological simulation framework benefitting from detailed information about the landscape, climate, and human activities. The resulting Hydrological European ReAnalysis (HERA) can be a valuable tool for studying hydrological dynamics, including the impacts of climate change and human activities on European water resources and flood and drought risks. 
 Since 1950, anthropogenic activities have altered the climate, land cover, soil properties, channel morphologies, and water management in the river basins of Europe. This has resulted in significant changes in hydrological conditions. The availability of consistent estimates of river flow at the global and continental levels is a necessity for assessing changes in the hydrological cycle. To overcome limitations posed by observations (incomplete records, inhomogeneous spatial coverage), we simulate river discharge for Europe for the period 1951–2020 using a state-of-the-art hydrological modelling approach. We use the new European set-up of the OS LISFLOOD model, running at 1 arcmin (≈1.8 km) with 6-hourly time steps. The hydrological model is forced by climate reanalysis data (ERA5-Land) that are bias-corrected and downscaled to the model resolution with gridded weather observations. The model also incorporates 72 surface field maps representing catchment morphology, vegetation, soil properties, land use, water demand, lakes, and reservoirs. Inputs related to human activities are evolving through time to emulate societal changes. The resulting Hydrological European ReAnalysis (HERA) provides 6-hourly river discharge for 282 521 river pixels with an upstream area >100 km2. We assess its skill using 2448 river gauging stations distributed across Europe. Overall, HERA delivers satisfying results (median KGE′=0.55), despite a general underestimation of observed mean discharges (mean bias=-13.1 %), and demonstrates a capacity to reproduce statistics of observed extreme flows. The performance of HERA increases through time and with catchment size, and it varies in space depending on reservoir influence and model calibration. The fine spatial and temporal resolution results in an enhanced performance compared to previous hydrological reanalysis based on OS LISFLOOD for small- to medium-scale catchments (100–10 000 km2). HERA is the first publicly available long-term, high-resolution hydrological reanalysis for Europe. Despite its limitations, HERA enables the analysis of hydrological dynamics related to extremes, human influences, and climate change at a continental scale while maintaining local relevance. It also creates the opportunity to study these dynamics in ungauged catchments across Europe. The HERA hydrological reanalysis and its climate and dynamic socio-economic inputs are available via the JRC data catalogue: https://doi.org/10.2905/a605a675-9444-4017-8b34-d66be5b18c95 (Tilloy et al., 2024)."

This study generates a dataset of high-resolution divergence and vorticity profiles using the measurements of radar wind profiler mesonet in Beijing. The negative divergence and positive vorticity are present in advance of rainfall events. This suggests that this dataset can help improve our understanding of prestorm environment and has the potential to be applied to weather forecasting. 
 Low-level convergence and cyclonic circulation are one of the most important dynamic variables in governing the initiation and development of convective storms. Our ability to obtain high-resolution horizontal divergence and vertical vorticity profiles, nevertheless, remains limited largely due to the lack of vertical wind observations. To fill this data gap, a high-density mesonet consisting of six radar wind profilers (RWP) sites has been operated in Beijing, which allowed for continuous observations of the three-dimensional winds with high vertical resolution. This paper aims to produce a temporally continuous horizontal divergence and vertical vorticity dataset at the vertical resolution of 120 m, which are derived from horizontal winds measured by the RWP mesonet in Beijing by using the triangle method. This dataset is generated at intervals of 6-minute for the whole year of 2023, covering the altitude range of 0–5 km. The dynamic variables from RWP mesonet are found to scatter sharply, as opposed to those from ERA5 that are concentrated around zero, especially at the high altitudes. Particularly, the negative divergence and positive vorticity are detected in the low-level troposphere up to 1 h in advance of the occurrence of rainfall events, and their magnitudes are increasingly becoming greater when the time comes closer to the rainfall onset, exhibiting the key role that the dataset plays in rainfall nowcasting. This is indicative of, to some extent, the effectiveness of high-resolution divergence and vorticity dataset in Beijing. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14176969 (Guo et al., 2024a), which is of significance for a multitude of scientific research and applications, including convection initiation, air quality forecasting, among others. Therefore, the findings highlight the urgent need of exploiting the dynamic variables from the RWP mesonet measurements to better characterize the pre-storm environment."

For the first time, this study utilized multi-sensor Landsat data and a deep learning model, the full resolution network (FR-Net), to explore the annual mapping of paddy rice for Northeast China from 1985 to 2023 (available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27604839.v1, Zhang et al., 2024). First, a cross-sensor paddy training dataset comprising 155 Landsat images was created to map the paddy rice. Then, we developed the annual result enhancement (ARE) method, which considers the differences in category probability of FR-Net at different stages to diminish the impact of the limited training sample in large-scale and across-sensors paddy rice mapping. The accuracy of the paddy rice dataset was evaluated using 107954 ground truth samples. In comparison to traditional rice mapping methods, the results obtained using the ARE method showed a 6 % increase in the F1 score. The overall mapping result obtained from the FR-Net model and ARE methods achieved high user accuracy (UA), producer accuracy (PA), F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values of 0.92, 0.95, 0.93, and 0.81, respectively. The study revealed that the area used for paddy rice cultivation in Northeast China increased from 1.11×104 km2 to 6.45×104 km2. Between 1985 and 2023, there was an overall expansion of 5.34×104 km2 in the paddy rice cultivation area, with the highest growth (4.33×104 km2) occurring in Heilongjiang province. This study shows that long-history crop mapping could be achieved with deep learning, and the result of paddy rice will be beneficial for making timely adjustments to cultivation patterns and ensuring food security."

Podladchikov,"Accelerated pseudo-transient method for elastic, viscoelastic, and coupled hydromechanical problems with applications","The accelerated pseudo-transient (APT) method is an efficient way to solve partial differential equations, particularly well-suited for parallel computing. This paper explores the APT method's effectiveness in solving elastic, viscoelastic, and hydromechanical problems, focusing on quasi-static conditions in 1D, 2D, and 3D. The study examines the best numerical settings for fast and accurate solutions. The paper shows how the APT method can handle complex problems in high-resolution models. 
 The accelerated pseudo-transient (APT) method is a matrix-free approach used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), characterized by its reliance on local operations, which makes it highly suitable for parallelization. With the advent of the memory-wall phenomenon around 2005, where memory access speed overtook floating-point operations as the bottleneck in high-performance computing, the APT method has gained prominence as a powerful tool for tackling various PDEs in geosciences. Recent advancements have demonstrated the APT method's computational efficiency, particularly when applied to quasi-static nonlinear problems using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the APT method, focusing on its application to quasi-static elastic, viscoelastic, and coupled hydromechanical problems, specifically those governed by quasi-static Biot poroelastic equations, across 1D, 2D, and 3D domains. We systematically investigate the optimal numerical parameters required to achieve rapid convergence, offering valuable insights into the method's applicability and efficiency for a range of physical models. Our findings are validated against analytical solutions, underscoring the robustness and accuracy of the APT method in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. We explore the influence of boundary conditions, nonlinearities, and coupling on the optimal convergence parameters, highlighting the method's adaptability in addressing complex and realistic scenarios. To demonstrate the flexibility of the APT method, we apply it to the nonlinear mechanical problem of strain localization using a poro-elasto-viscoplastic rheological model, achieving extremely high resolutions – 10 0002 in 2D and 5123 in 3D – that, to our knowledge, have not been previously explored for such models. Our study contributes significantly to the field by providing a robust framework for the effective implementation of the APT method in solving challenging geophysical problems. Importantly, the results presented in this paper are fully reproducible, with MATLAB code, symbolic Maple scripts, and CUDA C codes made available in a permanent repository."

This study provides the first snapshots of organic micropollutants (OMPs) along the 1466 km Eastern Route of China’s South-to-North Water Diversion Project. Using nontarget analysis with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified and quantified 357 OMPs from water samples collected during the water diversion period (WDP) and the nonwater diversion period (NWDP). The OMPs included 136 household compounds, 112 agricultural compounds, 102 industrial compounds, and 7 traffic markers. Significant regional variations in OMP concentrations and compositions  were observed during the NWDP due to diverse local pollution sources along the route. However, such differences were reduced during the WDP, likely due to water transfer. OMP diversity varied substantially during the NWDP but was more stable with less distance decay during the WDP. Network analysis indicated closer relationships between the OMPs during the WDP, suggesting a more consistent spatial distribution. The source water overwhelmingly influenced the water quality along the diversion route.

Vacancy defects have been shown to significantly enhance arsenate (As) immobilization by hematite. However, the contributions from vacancy defects on different exposed facets of hematite have not been fully quantified. In this study, hematite samples with various morphologies were pretreated with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to generate oxygen vacancy defects (OVDs), analyzed quantitatively using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). Batch experiments revealed that the OVDs on different exposed facets showed significant variations in improving arsenate adsorption, i.e., the quantitative enhancement of arsenate adsorption amount per unit OVD concentration (ΔQm/Cdefect) followed the sequence of (110) facet (80.05 μmol/mmoldef) > (001) facet (31.85 μmol/mmoldef) > (012) facet (13.14 μmol/mmoldef). The underlying mechanism by which OVDs affect arsenate adsorption across different exposed facets of hematite was studied. The results reveal that the tremendous improvement of arsenate adsorption caused by OVDs on the (110) facet compared to (001) and (012) facets was attributed to their stronger bonding strength of As to under-coordinated Fe atoms, thus significantly promoting the immobilization of arsenate.

 Soil alkalinization and global warming are predicted to pose major challenges to agriculture in the future, as they continue to accelerate, markedly reducing global arable land and crop yields1,2. Therefore, strategies for future agriculture are needed to further improve globally cultivated, relatively high-yielding Green Revolution varieties (GRVs) derived from the SEMIDWARF 1 (SD1) gene3,4. Here we propose that precise regulation of the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) to optimal levels is the key to not only confer alkali–thermal tolerance to GRVs, but also to further enhance their yield. Endogenous modulation of ALKALI-THERMAL TOLERANCE 1/2 (ATT1/2), quantitative trait loci encoding GA20-oxidases or exogenous application of GA minimized rice yield loss affected by sodic soils. Mechanistically, high GA concentrations induce reactive oxygen species over-accumulation, whereas low GA concentrations repress the expression of stress-tolerance genes by means of DELLA–NGR5-mediated H3K27me3 methylation. We further showed that ATT1 induces large fluctuations in GA levels, whereas ATT2 is the ideal candidate for fine-tuning GA concentrations to appropriate levels to balance reactive oxygen species and H3K27me3 methylation to improve alkali–thermal tolerance and yield. Thus, ATT2 is expected to be a potential new post-Green Revolution gene that could be harnessed to develop and use marginal lands for sustainable agriculture in the future. Precise regulation of the phytohormone gibberellin to optimal levels may not only confer alkali–thermal tolerance to Green Revolution rice varieties but may also further enhance their yield, and ATT2, by enabling the fine-tuning of gibberellins, is expected to be a potential new post-Green Revolution gene."

Here, the authors show that therapy-resistant cancer cells enhance fatty acid metabolism, which can be therapeutically targeted by inhibiting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). 
 Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy (cetuximab) shows a limited clinical benefit for patients with locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), due to the frequent occurrence of secondary resistance mechanisms. Here we report that cetuximab-resistant HNSCC cells display a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα)-mediated lipid metabolism reprogramming, with increased fatty acid uptake and oxidation capacities, while glycolysis is not modified. This metabolic shift makes cetuximab-resistant HNSCC cells particularly sensitive to a pharmacological inhibition of either carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) or PPARα in 3D spheroids and tumor xenografts in mice. Importantly, the PPARα-related gene signature, in human clinical datasets, correlates with lower response to anti-EGFR therapy and poor survival in HNSCC patients, thereby validating its clinical relevance. This study points out lipid metabolism rewiring as a non-genetic resistance-causing mechanism in HNSCC that may be therapeutically targeted to overcome acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. Resistance to anti-EGFR therapy is a clinical issue for patients with advanced head and neck cancers.

Multivariable analysis is identifying advanced age, high Body Mass Index (BMI), Marfan syndrome, severe aortic regurgitation, bicuspid aortic valve, increased aortic root diameter, and reduced aortic cross-clamp time (ACC) as significant factors associated with ARR. After Propensity Score Matching (PSM), VSRR is showing significantly higher 5-year survival rates than ARR (80.2% vs. 64.1%, P = 0.001), validated by Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) analysis. Reintervention rates are being found comparable, with endocarditis more prevalent in ARR and aortic regurgitation in VSRR. Subgroup analysis indicated that patients aged less than 60 years and those with a BMI greater than 24 in the VSRR group exhibited significantly improved survival probabilities compared to the ARR group. These findings support the wider utilization of valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) in appropriately selected patients, highlighting its potential advantages for suitable candidates.

 Accelerating the discovery of novel crystal materials by machine learning is crucial for advancing various technologies from clean energy to information processing. The machine-learning models for prediction of materials properties require embedding atomic information, while traditional methods have limited effectiveness in enhancing prediction accuracy. Here, we proposed an atomic embedding strategy called universal atomic embeddings (UAEs) for their broad applicability as atomic fingerprints, and generated the UAE tensors based on the proposed CrystalTransformer model. By performing experiments on widely-used materials database, our CrystalTransformer-based UAEs (ct-UAEs) are shown to accurately capture complex atomic features, leading to a 14% improvement in prediction accuracy on CGCNN and 18% on ALIGNN when using formation energies as the target, based on the Materials Project database. We also demonstrated the good transferability of ct-UAEs across various databases. Based on the clustering analysis for multi-task ct-UAEs, the elements in the periodic table can be categorized with reasonable connections between atomic features and targeted crystal properties. After applying ct-UAEs to predict formation energy in hybrid perovskites database, we realized an improvement in accuracy, with a 34% boost in MEGNET and 16% in CGCNN, showcasing their potential as atomic fingerprints to address the data scarcity challenges.

 Bunyavirales is a very large order including viruses infecting a variety of taxonomic groups such as arthropods, vertebrates, plants, and protozoa. Some bunyaviruses are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by blood-sucking arthropods and cause major diseases in humans and animals. It is not understood why only some bunyaviruses have evolved the capacity to be transmitted by arthropod vectors. Here we show that only vector-borne bunyaviruses express a non-structural protein, NSm, whose function has so far remained largely elusive. Using as experimental system Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) and its invertebrate host, Aedes aegypti, we show that NSm is dispensable for viral replication in mosquito cells in vitro but is absolutely required for successful infection in the female mosquito following a blood meal. More specifically, NSm is required for cell-to-cell spread and egress from the mosquito midgut, a known barrier to viral infection. Notably, the requirement for NSm is specific to the midgut; bypassing this barrier by experimental intrathoracic infection of the mosquito eliminates the necessity of NSm for virus spread in other tissues, including the salivary glands. Overall, we unveiled a key evolutionary process that allows the transmission of vector-borne bunyaviruses between arthropod and vertebrate hosts. Bunyaviruses are a large group of viruses that infect a wide range of organisms, including insects, animals, plants, and single-celled organisms.

Here, we investigate the influence of age, sex, and their interaction on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the brown anole (Anolis sagrei), a lizard with pronounced female-biased survival and longevity. We develop a series of age predictor models and find that, contrary to our predictions, rates of epigenetic aging were not slower in female lizards. However, methylation states at loci acquiring age-associated changes appear to be more “youthful” in young females, suggesting that female DNA methylomes are preemptively fortified in early life in opposition to the direction of age-related drift.

Our findings reveal that regional estimates substantially understate sea level rise in parts of San Francisco and Los Angeles, projecting more than double the expected rise by 2050. Additionally, temporally variable (nonlinear) VLM, driven by factors such as hydrocarbon and groundwater extraction, can increase uncertainties in 2050 projections by up to 0.4 meters in certain areas of Los Angeles and San Diego. This study highlights the critical need to include local VLM and its uncertainties in sea level rise assessments to improve coastal management and ensure effective adaptation efforts."
10.1126/sciadv.adq8086,False,Science Advances,这篇研究论文关注的是气候变化对亚马逊雨林鸟类生存率的影响。研究人员通过长期监测(27年)4264只个体鸟类，发现干燥季节温度升高和降雨减少显著降低了24个物种的生存率，寿命较长的物种受影响更大。模型预测，干燥季节平均气温每升高1°C，林下鸟类群落的平均表观生存率将下降63%。 这项研究挑战了原始雨林能够完全保护其生物多样性免受日益恶劣的气候条件影响的观点，揭示了气候变化对亚马逊雨林鸟类生存的直接影响。  研究中使用了长期野外观察数据，而非大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。,[],Jared D.

However, this assumption contrasts with emerging evidence of Neotropical bird population declines in intact rainforests. We assessed the vulnerability of resident rainforest birds to climatic variability, focusing on dry season severity characterized by hotter temperatures and reduced rainfall. Analyzing 4264 individual bird captures over 27 years, we found that harsher Amazonian dry seasons significantly reduced apparent survival for 24 of 29 species, with longer-lived species being more strongly affected. Our model predicted that a 1°C increase in average dry season temperature would reduce the mean apparent survival of the understory bird community by 63%. These findings directly link climate change to declining bird survival in the Amazon, challenging the notion that pristine rainforests can fully protect their biodiversity under increasingly severe climate conditions."
10.1126/sciadv.ads9781,False,Science Advances,这篇论文研究的是植原体如何抑制昆虫的黑色素化免疫反应以促进其在昆虫载体中的传播。研究发现植原体编码的效应蛋白SRP1通过与丝氨酸蛋白酶SP2竞争性结合，抑制了 prophenoloxidase 的激活，从而抑制了黑色素化反应，促进了植原体的增殖。 这与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测，卫星观测和大气成分分析，没有任何关系。,[],Xiao-Feng Zhang;Zhanpeng Li;Jiaxin Qiu;Ruonan Zhang;Zhoumian Jiang;Tengfei Wang;Hongyan Chen;Taiyun Wei,A phytoplasma effector suppresses insect melanization immune response to promote pathogen persistent transmission,"Insect melanization triggered by the conversion of prophenoloxidase to active phenoloxidase via serine proteases (SPs) is an important immediate immune response. However, how phytoplasmas evade this immune response to promote their propagation in insect vectors remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that infection of leafhopper vectors with rice orange leaf phytoplasma (ROLP) activates the mild melanization response in hemolymph. ROLP-encoded effector protein SRP1 is highly expressed in leafhopper hemolymph, where it competitively binds to SP2, thereby inhibiting SP2-mediated cleavage of prophenoloxidase into active phenoloxidase. Consequently, microinjection of SRP1 effectively suppresses the melanization response and enhances ROLP propagation. The histidine residue at position 23 of SRP1 is essential for SRP1-SP2 interaction, and the mutation of this position abolishes its ability to inhibit such SP2-meidated cleavage, ultimately promoting melanization response and inhibiting ROLP propagation. Our findings provide insights into how phytoplasmas antagonize insect melanization response to facilitate their persistent transmission."

While previous studies have primarily focused on direct modulation of neuronal activity for post-stroke treatment, accumulating evidence suggests that astrocytes may play a critical role in post-stroke progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for recovery. In this study, we investigate the effects of selective modulation of astrocytic calcium signals on chronic stroke using OptoSTIM1, an optogenetic tool that activates endogenous calcium channels. In contrast to channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), OptoSTIM1 robustly elevates astrocytic calcium levels, sustaining the increase for over 10 min upon a single activation. The calcium elevation in astrocytes in the ipsilesional sensory-parietal cortex leads to remarkable recovery from post-stroke impairment. Thus, manipulating intracellular calcium levels in astrocytes holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for improving recovery following a stroke."

Immunocompromised individuals from conditions such as primary immune disorders, HIV, or posttransplant immunosuppressive therapies are particularly vulnerable because of EBV’s transformative capability. EBV remodels B cell metabolism to support energy, biosynthetic precursors, and redox equivalents necessary for transformation. Most EBV-driven metabolic pathways center on mitochondria. However, how EBV regulates B cell mitochondrial function and metabolic fluxes remains unclear. Here, we show that EBV boosts cardiolipin (CL) biosynthesis, essential for mitochondrial cristae biogenesis, via EBV nuclear antigen 2/MYC-induced CL enzyme transactivation. Pharmacological and CRISPR genetic analyses underscore the essentiality of CL biosynthesis in EBV-transformed B cells. Metabolomic and isotopic tracing highlight CL’s role in sustaining respiration, one-carbon metabolism, and aspartate synthesis. Disrupting CL biosynthesis destabilizes mitochondrial matrix enzymes pivotal to these pathways. We demonstrate EBV-induced CL metabolism as a therapeutic target, offering synthetic lethal strategies against EBV-associated B cell malignancies."

However, the development of energy-efficient and highly parallel optical nonlinearities, a critical component in ONNs, remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a nonlinear optical microdevice array (NOMA) compatible with incoherent illumination by integrating the liquid crystal cell with silicon photodiodes at the single-pixel level. We fabricate NOMA with more than half a million pixels, each functioning as an optical analog of the rectified linear unit at ultralow switching energy down to 100 femtojoules per pixel. With NOMA, we demonstrate an optical multilayer neural network. Our work holds promise for large-scale and low-power deep ONNs, computer vision, and real-time optical image processing."

Rimmer,Tracing the inner edge of the habitable zone with sulfur chemistry,"The circumstellar liquid-water habitable zone guides our search for potentially inhabited exoplanets but remains observationally untested. We show that the inner edge of the habitable zone can now be mapped among exoplanets using their lack of surface water, which, unlike the presence of water, can be unambiguously revealed by atmospheric sulfur species. Using coupled climate-chemistry modeling, we find that the observability of sulfur gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: Most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalize this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the habitable zone in the near future."

Although proprioceptors are known as non-nociceptive mechanoreceptors, they also express the pro-nociceptive acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) (2–5). To probe the role for proprioceptors in sensing acidosis (or sngception) (6), we found that genetic deletion ofAsic3in proprioceptors but not in nociceptors abolished acid-induced chronic hyperalgesia in mice. Chemo-optogenetically activating proprioceptors resulted in hyperalgesic priming that favored chronic pain induced by acidosis. In humans, intramuscular acidification induced acid perception but not pain. Conversely, in a spinal cord–injured patient who lost pain sensation in the right leg, proprioception and sngception were remaining somatosensory functions, associated with the spinal dorsal column. Together, evidence from both mouse and human studies suggests a role for proprioceptors in sngception."
