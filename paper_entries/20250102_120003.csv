10.1021/acs.est.4c09103,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了北京市冬季氨气（NH3）和气溶胶铵（NH4+）的氮同位素组成，探讨了非农业排放的氨气对气溶胶铵的影响。研究发现，清洁日和污染日NH3和NH4+之间δ15N的差异显著不同，表明动力学分馏和平衡分馏共同作用于NH3和NH4+的转化。通过考虑动力学和平衡分馏，研究者对NH4+的来源进行了重新分配，结果表明，以往仅考虑平衡分馏的方法低估了非农业排放的贡献。该研究强调了在利用氮同位素进行气溶胶铵来源解析时，同时考虑动力学和平衡分馏的重要性，这对于提高空气质量监测和污染控制的精度具有重要意义。,"['Aerosol ammonium', 'Ammonia (NH3)', 'Air pollution', 'Nitrogen isotopes', 'Source apportionment', 'Air quality monitoring']",Mengna Gu;Yang Zeng;Wendell W. Walters;Qian Sun;Yunting Fang;Yuepeng Pan,Enhanced Nonagricultural Emissions of Ammonia Influence Aerosol Ammonium in an Urban Atmosphere: Evidence from Kinetic Versus Equilibrium Isotope Fractionation Controls on Nitrogen,"Aerosol ammonium (NH4+) is a critical component of particulate matter that affects air pollution, climate, and human health. Isotope-based source apportionment of NH4+ is essential for ammonia (NH3) mitigation but the role of kinetic vs equilibrium controls on nitrogen isotope (δ15N) fractionation between NH3 and NH4+ remains unresolved. Based on concurrent  measurements of NH3 and NH4+ in winter Beijing, we observed that the difference of δ15N between NH3 and NH4+ on clean days (3.3 ± 13.3‰) was significantly lower than that during polluted periods (30.2 ± 11.8‰). This difference signified  incomplete  equilibrium fractionation and that kinetic fractionation may have occurred between NH3 and NH4+, especially during clean days. Assuming that kinetic and equilibrium fractionation occurred successively, the contribution of nonagricultural emissions to NH4+ was apportioned to 60.3 ± 12.8%, higher than that of 50.4 ± 17.7% considering only equilibrium fractionation. These results indicate that the source apportionment of NH4+ considering only equilibrium fractionation in the conventional scenario would underestimate the contribution of nonagricultural emissions by 16.4% (up to 33.1% on clean days). Our analysis highlighted the importance in considering both kinetic and equilibrium fractionation scenarios to improve the precision of NH4+ source apportionment by using nitrogen isotopes."
10.1021/acs.est.4c09545,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了CO2封存技术（CSTs）在中国实现净零排放目标中的作用及其对可持续发展目标的影响。虽然CSTs可以降低实现净零排放的成本，但它可能会对非化石能源渗透率、空气质量和公众健康产生负面影响。研究使用了一个综合建模框架，评估了CSTs在气候-能源-空气-健康级联中的利弊。研究发现，CSTs虽然可以节省巨额资金，但也可能导致高达7.82万亿元人民币的损失。因此，论文强调需要在CSTs的益处和弊端之间取得平衡，建议优先将CSTs应用于电力部门，并在向非电力部门应用CSTs之前，对其进行严格的末端处理设备改造。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到空气质量监测（空气质量改善与否是CSTs应用的直接结果）、CO2排放监测（需要通过卫星观测或地面监测来验证）以及大气成分分析（CO2是大气成分的重要组成部分）。,"['air quality', 'CO2 emissions', 'atmospheric composition', 'satellite observations', 'integrated modeling']",Zeyuan Liu;Kai Fang;Anqi Xu;Zuhui Zhang;Jing Zhu;Hetong Wang;Yi Zhang;Zhenci Xu;Fangming Jiang;Qingyu Zhang;Jinnan Wang,CO2 Sequestration Technologies May Undermine China’s Sustainable Development Goals through the Climate-Energy-Air-Health Cascade,"CO2 sequestration technologies (CSTs) allow for increased CO2 emissions without exceeding a chosen temperature limit by creating additional carbon budgets. While these CO2 sequestration technologies offer low-cost routes to net-zero emissions, namely, the CST benefits, they impede progress to the Sustainable Development Goals, namely, the CST disbenefits. Focusing on China, we assess both the CST disbenefits and benefits in the climate-energy-air-health cascade by an integrated modeling framework. We show that, CST can save 4.98–15.65 trillion CNY in achieving net-zero emissions while compromising the sustainability on non-fossil energy penetration, air quality, and public health improvement, leading to a substantial loss up to 7.82 trillion CNY during 2020–2060. Given the high likelihood of a large-scale deployment of CSTs in the future, pursuing policy coherence that balances trade-offs between CST disbenefits and benefits is vital. To that end, CSTs should be allocated to power sectors as a priority and stringent end-of-pipe equipment should be retrofitted into non-power sectors before CST allocation."

E. Krause;Tina Treude,Iron Oxides Fuel Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane in the Presence of Sulfate in Hypersaline Coastal Wetland Sediment,"Wetland methane emissions are the primary natural contributor to the global methane budget, accounting for approximately one-third of total emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) serves as the major sink of methane in anoxic wetland sediments, where electron acceptors are present, thereby effectively mitigating its emissions. Nevertheless, environmental controls on electron acceptors, in particular, the ubiquitous iron oxides, involved in AOM are poorly understood. Here, we explored methane sinks within a hypersaline pool situated in a coastal wetland. The geochemical profiles reveal a tiering, where microbial sulfate reduction dominates in the organic-rich surface sediment, yielding to iron reduction in the deeper organic-poor yet sulfate-rich subsurface sediment. This shift is attributed to the drilling-induced depression and subsequent diagenetic transformation of the surface sediment. Radiotracer incubations demonstrate a strong association of AOM with sulfate in surface sediment and with iron oxides in subsurface sediment. Despite high concentrations of sulfate in coastal wetlands, Fe-dependent AOM may play a significant, yet often under-considered, role as a sink for methane emissions."

However, the physiological and defense response mechanisms of plants exposed to multiple stresses remain largely unexplored. Herein, we examined how foliar application of biogenic nanosilica (BNS) impacts rice plant growth, molecular defenses, and metabolic responses when subjected to arsenic (As) toxicity and infested by the insect Chilo suppressalis. We show that BNS significantly increased shoot and root silicon accumulation but reduced the shoot As content by 34.7% under herbivory. Additionally, BNS reduced C. suppressalis larval weight gain by 34.5 and 12.3% without and with As stress, respectively. Importantly, BNS enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity under As stress, herbivore attack, and combined pressures, surpassing the effects of traditional silicate fertilizers. BNS ultimately increased rice shoot biomass by 8.2–23.4% under the respective stress conditions compared to the control treatment. Moreover, while As stress alone diminished the plant’s resistance to herbivores, BNS application countered this effect by increasing detoxifying compound (e.g., glutathione) production and antioxidant enzyme activity. This study highlights the impact of biotic and abiotic stress interactions on BNS-enhanced plant resilience mechanisms in rice plants, reallocating resources to counter heavy metal toxicity and herbivore damage in agroecosystems."

Previous studies have focused on evaluating the cobenefits of climate policies on air quality, studies that consider how air pollution controls affect carbon emissions remain relatively sparse. To evaluate different emission reduction strategies’ impacts on multiple air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2), here we apply a multi-pollutant analysis framework, focused on sulfur dioxide (SO2) controls on coal-fired EGUs in the United States (U.S.). Eighty-nine EGUs without SO2 controls in the contiguous U.S. as of 2020 are identified and investigated. Results show that add-on pollution controls like flue gas desulfurization (FGD) reduce SO2 emissions from coal combustion, but increase emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and CO2. A coal-to-natural gas transition reduces all pollutants except VOCs. A coal-to-renewable transition reduces all studied pollutants. We find that add-on SO2 controls could generate a total annual net benefit of $13.4 billion nationwide when considering a multi-pollutant portfolio of emissions, as compared with $32.9 billion total annual net benefits from coal-to-natural gas transition and $40.5 billion from coal-to-renewable transition. Our results highlight the potential of implementing the multi-pollutant analysis framework to evaluate multi-pollutant emission reduction strategies."

However, the mechanistic understanding of how large eddies originating from both the ground (updrafts) and aloft (downdrafts) regulate flux convergence (FC) and divergence (FD) remains relatively unexplored. Based on turbulence data measured at 12 levels, spanning from 1.2 to 60.5 m above the ground, we observe a notable increase in the variability of sensible heat flux magnitudes with height. Our results show that FC and FD of sensible heat are primarily linked to variations in the respective transport efficiencies (γwθ ${\gamma }_{w\theta }$) at different heights. Using the cross‐wavelet transform, we find that in FC cases, the regions with high wavelet coherence expand with height, resulting in higher γwθ ${\gamma }_{w\theta }$ at higher levels compared to low ones. Conversely, in FD cases, the regions with high wavelet coherence decrease with height, leading to lower γwθ ${\gamma }_{w\theta }$ at higher levels. Large eddies with length scales of approximately 120–500 m have a significant impact on amplifying or attenuating γwθ ${\gamma }_{w\theta }$ at higher levels compared to lower levels. Using conditional sampling to extract the updrafts and downdrafts of large eddies, distinct patterns are observed in the characteristics of updrafts and downdrafts between FC and FD groups especially in their flux contribution and transport efficiencies. This work emphasizes the significant contribution of asymmetric turbulent transport by updrafts and downdrafts to the discrepancy between the observed turbulent fluxes and those predicted by the Monin‐Obukhov similarity theory."

In this manuscript, CBH is retrieved using a multi‐linear regression equation, while CBVV used a random forests model. Both retrievals combine satellite and numerical weather prediction data. The satellite data used are the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite imagery, while measurements of CBH and CBVV include DL and radiosonde data at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement observatory. Data from 83 summer days (May‐August) in 2018–2021 featuring cumulus clouds forced by solar heating were examined and used to train the models, with years 2022–2023 used for validation. Various spatial domains were defined with one large (2.4° longitude by 2.0° latitude) SGP domain being split into smaller sections (smallest being 0.99° and 0.61° longitude and latitude respectably). CBH and CBVV values obtained from the DL as compared to the models show root mean square errors between 150 and 200 m, with CBVV values between 0.45 and 1 ms−1. It was found that the CBH formulation performs well over all domains, while the CBVV retrievals become less accurate due to more turbulence being introduced into the observations as the number of DL stations decreases in the smaller domains."

 Silicon photonics is a rapidly developing technology that promises to revolutionize the way we communicate, compute and sense the world1–6. However, the lack of highly scalable, native complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)-integrated light sources is one of the main factors hampering its widespread adoption. Despite considerable progress in hybrid and heterogeneous integration of III–V light sources on silicon7–12, monolithic integration by direct epitaxy of III–V materials remains the pinnacle of cost-effective on-chip light sources. Here we report the electrically driven gallium arsenide (GaAs)-based laser diodes fully fabricated on 300-mm Si wafers in a CMOS pilot manufacturing line based on a new integration approach, nano-ridge engineering. GaAs nano-ridge waveguides with embedded p–i–n diodes and InGaAs quantum wells are grown at high quality on a wafer scale. Room-temperature continuous-wave lasing is demonstrated at wavelengths around 1,020 nm in more than 300 devices across a wafer, with threshold currents as low as 5 mA, output powers beyond 1 mW, laser linewidths down to 46 MHz and laser operation up to 55 °C.

 Stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments, termed niches, at several different locations in tissues1–3. The differential functions of heterogeneous stem cells and niches are important given the increasing clinical applications of stem-cell transplantation and immunotherapy. Whether hierarchical structures among stem cells at distinct niches exist and further control aspects of immune tolerance is unknown. Here we describe previously unknown new hierarchical arrangements in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow niches that dictate both regenerative potential and immune privilege. High-level nitric oxide-generating (NOhi) HSCs are refractory to immune attack and exhibit delayed albeit robust long-term reconstitution. Such highly immune-privileged, primitive NOhi HSCs co-localize with distinctive capillaries characterized by primary ciliated endothelium and high levels of the immune-checkpoint molecule CD200. These capillaries regulate the regenerative functions of NOhi HSCs through the ciliary protein IFT20 together with CD200, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and autophagy signals, which further mediate immunoprotection. Notably, previously described niche constituents, sinusoidal cells and type-H vessels2–10 co-localize with less immune-privileged and less potent NOlow HSCs. Together, we identify highly immune-privileged, late-rising primitive HSCs and characterize their immunoprotective niches comprising specialized vascular domains. Our results indicate that the niche orchestrates hierarchy in stem cells and immune tolerance, and highlight future immunotherapeutic targets.

Here we introduce non-toxic ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms. These optical ‘microgauges’ comprise upconverting NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during feeding on the order of 10 µN and that the temporal pattern of force generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm7,8.

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) originates from differentiated hepatocytes undergoing compensatory proliferation in livers damaged by viruses or metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)1. While increasing HCC risk2, MASH triggers p53-dependent hepatocyte senescence3, which we found to parallel hypernutrition-induced DNA breaks. How this tumour-suppressive response is bypassed to license oncogenic mutagenesis and enable HCC evolution was previously unclear. Here we identified the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) as a p53 target that is elevated in senescent-like MASH hepatocytes but suppressed through promoter hypermethylation and proteasomal degradation in most human HCCs. FBP1 first declines in metabolically stressed premalignant disease-associated hepatocytes and HCC progenitor cells4,5, paralleling the protumorigenic activation of AKT and NRF2. By accelerating FBP1 and p53 degradation, AKT and NRF2 enhance the proliferation and metabolic activity of previously senescent HCC progenitors. The senescence-reversing and proliferation-supportive NRF2–FBP1–AKT–p53 metabolic switch, operative in mice and humans, also enhances the accumulation of DNA-damage-induced somatic mutations needed for MASH-to-HCC progression.

 Many known and unknown historical events have remained below detection thresholds of genetic studies because subtle ancestry changes are challenging to reconstruct. Methods based on shared haplotypes1,2 and rare variants3,4 improve power but are not explicitly temporal and have not been possible to adopt in unbiased ancestry models. Here we develop Twigstats, an approach of time-stratified ancestry analysis that can improve statistical power by an order of magnitude by focusing on coalescences in recent times, while remaining unbiased by population-specific drift. We apply this framework to 1,556 available ancient whole genomes from Europe in the historical period. We are able to model individual-level ancestry using preceding genomes to provide high resolution. During the first half of the first millennium ce, we observe at least two different streams of Scandinavian-related ancestry expanding across western, central and eastern Europe. By contrast, during the second half of the first millennium ce, ancestry patterns suggest the regional disappearance or substantial admixture of these ancestries. In Scandinavia, we document a major ancestry influx by approximately 800 ce, when a large proportion of Viking Age individuals carried ancestry from groups related to central Europe not seen in individuals from the early Iron Age. Our findings suggest that time-stratified ancestry analysis can provide a higher-resolution lens for genetic history.

 Accurate goal-directed behaviour requires the sense of touch to be integrated with information about body position and ongoing motion1,2. Behaviours such as chewing, swallowing and speech critically depend on precise tactile events on a rapidly moving tongue3, but neural circuits for dynamic touch-guided tongue control are unknown. Here, using high-speed videography, we examined three-dimensional lingual kinematics as mice drank from a water spout that unexpectedly changed position during licking, requiring re-aiming in response to subtle contact events on the left, centre or right surface of the tongue. Mice integrated information about both precise touch events and tongue position to re-aim ensuing licks. Touch-guided re-aiming was unaffected by photoinactivation of tongue sensory, premotor and motor cortices, but was impaired by photoinactivation of the lateral superior colliculus (latSC). Electrophysiological recordings identified latSC neurons with mechanosensory receptive fields for precise touch events that were anchored in tongue-centred, head-centred or conjunctive reference frames. Notably, latSC neurons also encoded tongue position before contact, information that is important for tongue-to-head-based coordinate transformations underlying accurate touch-guided aiming. Viral tracing revealed tongue sensory inputs to the latSC from the lingual trigeminal nucleus, and optical microstimulation in the latSC revealed a topographic map for aiming licks. These findings demonstrate that touch-guided tongue control relies on a collicular mechanosensorimotor map, analogous to collicular visuomotor maps associated with visually guided orienting across many species.

 Biological ageing can be defined as a gradual loss of homeostasis across various aspects of molecular and cellular function1,2. Mammalian brains consist of thousands of cell types3, which may be differentially susceptible or resilient to ageing. Here we present a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing roughly 1.2 million high-quality single-cell transcriptomes of brain cells from young adult and aged mice of both sexes, from regions spanning the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. High-resolution clustering of all cells results in 847 cell clusters and reveals at least 14 age-biased clusters that are mostly glial types. At the broader cell subclass and supertype levels, we find age-associated gene expression signatures and provide a list of 2,449 unique differentially expressed genes (age-DE genes) for many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Whereas most age-DE genes are unique to specific cell types, we observe common signatures with ageing across cell types, including a decrease in expression of genes related to neuronal structure and function in many neuron types, major astrocyte types and mature oligodendrocytes, and an increase in expression of genes related to immune function, antigen presentation, inflammation, and cell motility in immune cell types and some vascular cell types. Finally, we observe that some of the cell types that demonstrate the greatest sensitivity to ageing are concentrated around the third ventricle in the hypothalamus, including tanycytes, ependymal cells, and certain neuron types in the arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and paraventricular nucleus that express genes canonically related to energy homeostasis. Many of these types demonstrate both a decrease in neuronal function and an increase in immune response. These findings suggest that the third ventricle in the hypothalamus may be a hub for ageing in the mouse brain. Overall, this study systematically delineates a dynamic landscape of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal ageing that will serve as a foundation for the investigation of functional changes in ageing and the interaction of ageing and disease.

 Non-Abelian gauge fields1 provide a conceptual framework to describe particles having spins, underlying many phenomena in electrodynamics, condensed-matter physics2,3 and particle physics4,5. Lattice models6 of non-Abelian gauge fields allow us to understand their physical implications in extended systems. The theoretical importance of non-Abelian lattice gauge fields motivates their experimental synthesis and explorations7–9. Photons are fundamental particles for which artificial gauge fields can be synthesized10–30, yet the demonstration of non-Abelian lattice gauge fields for photons has not been achieved. Here we demonstrate SU(2) lattice gauge fields for photons in the synthetic frequency dimensions31,32, a playground to study lattice physics in a scalable and programmable way. In our lattice model, we theoretically observe that homogeneous non-Abelian lattice gauge potentials induce Dirac cones at time-reversal-invariant momenta in the Brillouin zone. We experimentally confirm the presence of non-Abelian lattice gauge fields by two signatures: linear band crossings at the Dirac cones, and the associated direction reversal of eigenstate trajectories. We further demonstrate a non-Abelian scalar lattice gauge potential that lifts the degeneracies of the Dirac cones. Our results highlight the implications of non-Abelian lattice gauge fields in topological physics, and provide a starting point for demonstrations of emerging non-Abelian physics in the photonic synthetic dimensions.

 The relation between d-wave superconductivity and stripes is fundamental to the understanding of ordered phases in high-temperature cuprate superconductors1–6. These phases can be strongly influenced by anisotropic couplings, leading to higher critical temperatures, as emphasized by the recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelates7–10. Quantum simulators with ultracold atoms provide a versatile platform to engineer such couplings and to observe emergent structures in real space with single-particle resolution. Here we show, to our knowledge, the first signatures of individual stripes in a cold-atom Fermi–Hubbard quantum simulator using mixed-dimensional (mixD) settings. Increasing the energy scale of hole–hole attraction to the spin exchange energy, we access the interesting crossover temperature regime in which stripes begin to form11. We observe extended, attractive correlations between hole dopants and find an increased probability of forming larger structures akin to individual stripes. In the spin sector, we study correlation functions up to the third order and find results consistent with stripe formation. These observations are interpreted as a precursor to the stripe phase, which is characterized by interleaved charge and spin density wave ordering with fluctuating lines of dopants separating domains of opposite antiferromagnetic order12–14.

 Inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) are genetic disorders that underlie susceptibility to infection, autoimmunity, autoinflammation, allergy and/or malignancy1. Incomplete penetrance is common among IEIs despite their monogenic basis2. Here we investigate the contribution of autosomal random monoallelic expression (aRMAE), a somatic commitment to the expression of one allele3,4, to phenotypic variability observed in families with IEIs. Using a clonal primary T cell system to assess aRMAE status of genes in healthy individuals, we find that 4.30% of IEI genes and 5.20% of all genes undergo aRMAE. Perturbing H3K27me3 and DNA methylation alters allele expression commitment, in support of two proposed mechanisms5,6 for the regulation of aRMAE. We tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with IEIs with shared genetic lesions but discordant clinical phenotypes for aRMAE. Among two relatives who were heterozygous for a mutation in PLCG2 (delEx19), an antibody deficiency phenotype corresponds to selective mutant allele expression in B cells. By contrast, among relatives who were heterozygous for a mutation in JAK1 (c.2099G>A; p.S700N), the unaffected carrier T cells predominantly expressed the wild-type JAK1 allele, whereas the affected carrier T cells exhibited biallelic expression. Allelic expression bias was also documented in phenotypically discordant family members with mutations in STAT1 and CARD11. This study highlights the importance of considering both the genotype and the ‘transcriptotype’ in analyses of the penetrance and expressivity of monogenic disorders.

 Mechanical force is an essential feature for many physical and biological processes1–7, and remote measurement of mechanical signals with high sensitivity and spatial resolution is needed for diverse applications, including robotics8, biophysics9,10, energy storage11 and medicine12,13. Nanoscale luminescent force sensors excel at measuring piconewton forces, whereas larger sensors have proven powerful in probing micronewton forces14–16. However, large gaps remain in the force magnitudes that can be probed remotely from subsurface or interfacial sites, and no individual, non-invasive sensor is capable of measuring over the large dynamic range needed to understand many systems14,17.

 Cerebral cortex development in humans is a highly complex and orchestrated process that is under tight genetic regulation. Rare mutations that alter gene expression or function can disrupt the structure of the cerebral cortex, resulting in a range of neurological conditions1. Lissencephaly (‘smooth brain’) spectrum disorders comprise a group of rare, genetically heterogeneous congenital brain malformations commonly associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability2. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain unknown. Here we establish hypoactivity of the mTOR pathway as a clinically relevant molecular mechanism in lissencephaly spectrum disorders. We characterized two types of cerebral organoid derived from individuals with genetically distinct lissencephalies with a recessive mutation in p53-induced death domain protein 1 (PIDD1) or a heterozygous chromosome 17p13.3 microdeletion leading to Miller–Dieker lissencephaly syndrome (MDLS). PIDD1-mutant organoids and MDLS organoids recapitulated the thickened cortex typical of human lissencephaly and demonstrated dysregulation of protein translation, metabolism and the mTOR pathway. A brain-selective activator of mTOR complex 1 prevented and reversed cellular and molecular defects in the lissencephaly organoids.

 The rapid melting of mountain glaciers and the vanishing of their streams is emblematic of climate change1,2. Glacier-fed streams (GFSs) are cold, oligotrophic and unstable ecosystems in which life is dominated by microbial biofilms2,3. However, current knowledge on the GFS microbiome is scarce4,5, precluding an understanding of its response to glacier shrinkage. Here, by leveraging metabarcoding and metagenomics, we provide a comprehensive survey of bacteria in the benthic microbiome across 152 GFSs draining the Earth’s major mountain ranges. We find that the GFS bacterial microbiome is taxonomically and functionally distinct from other cryospheric microbiomes. GFS bacteria are diverse, with more than half being specific to a given mountain range, some unique to single GFSs and a few cosmopolitan and abundant. We show how geographic isolation and environmental selection shape their biogeography, which is characterized by distinct compositional patterns between mountain ranges and hemispheres. Phylogenetic analyses furthermore uncovered microdiverse clades resulting from environmental selection, probably promoting functional resilience and contributing to GFS bacterial biodiversity and biogeography.

 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are microsecond-to-millisecond-duration radio transients1 that originate mostly from extragalactic distances. The FRB emission mechanism remains debated, with two main competing classes of models: physical processes that occur within close proximity to a central engine2–4; and relativistic shocks that propagate out to large radial distances5–8. The expected emission-region sizes are notably different between these two types of models9. Here we present the measurement of two mutually coherent scintillation scales in the frequency spectrum of FRB 20221022A10: one originating from a scattering screen located within the Milky Way, and the second originating from its host galaxy or local environment. We use the scattering media as an astrophysical lens to constrain the size of the observed FRB lateral emission region9 to ≲3 × 104 kilometres. This emission size is inconsistent with the expectation for the large-radial-distance models5–8, and is more naturally explained by an emission process that operates within or just beyond the magnetosphere of a central compact object. Recently, FRB 20221022A was found to exhibit an S-shaped polarization angle swing10, most likely originating from a magnetospheric emission process. The scintillation results presented in this work independently support this conclusion, while highlighting scintillation as a useful tool in our understanding of FRB emission physics and progenitors.

 Reproduction, development and homeostasis depend on motile cilia, whose rhythmic beating is powered by a microtubule-based molecular machine called the axoneme. Although an atomic model of the axoneme is available for the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii1, structures of mammalian axonemes are incomplete1–5. Furthermore, we do not fully understand how molecular structures of axonemes vary across motile-ciliated cell types in the body. Here we use cryoelectron microscopy, cryoelectron tomography and proteomics to resolve the 96-nm modular repeat of axonemal doublet microtubules (DMTs) from both sperm flagella and epithelial cilia of the oviduct, brain ventricles and respiratory tract.

 Glioblastoma is an incurable brain malignancy. By the time of clinical diagnosis, these tumours exhibit a degree of genetic and cellular heterogeneity that provides few clues to the mechanisms that initiate and drive gliomagenesis1,2. Here, to explore the early steps in gliomagenesis, we utilized conditional gene deletion and lineage tracing in tumour mouse models, coupled with serial magnetic resonance imaging, to initiate and then closely track tumour formation. We isolated labelled and unlabelled cells at multiple stages—before the first visible abnormality, at the time of the first visible lesion, and then through the stages of tumour growth—and subjected cells of each stage to single-cell profiling. We identify a malignant cell state with a neural crest-like gene expression signature that is highly abundant in the early stages, but relatively diminished in the late stage of tumour growth. Genomic analysis based on the presence of copy number alterations suggests that these neural crest-like states exist as part of a heterogeneous clonal hierarchy that evolves with tumour growth. By exploring the injury response in wounded normal mouse brains, we identify cells with a similar signature that emerge following injury and then disappear over time, suggesting that activation of an injury response program occurs during tumorigenesis. Indeed, our experiments reveal a non-malignant injury-like microenvironment that is initiated in the brain following oncogene activation in cerebral precursor cells. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the early stages of glioblastoma, identifying a unique cell state and an injury response program tied to early tumour formation. These findings have implications for glioblastoma therapies and raise new possibilities for early diagnosis and prevention of disease.

 Understanding the causes of past atmospheric methane (CH4) variability is important for characterizing the relationship between CH4, global climate and terrestrial biogeochemical cycling. Ice core records of atmospheric CH4 contain rapid variations linked to abrupt climate changes of the last glacial period known as Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) events and Heinrich events (HE)1,2. The drivers of these CH4 variations remain unknown but can be constrained with ice core measurements of the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CH4, which is sensitive to the strength of different isotopically distinguishable emission categories (microbial, pyrogenic and geologic)3–5. Here we present multi-decadal-scale measurements of δ13C–CH4 and δD–CH4 from the WAIS Divide and Talos Dome ice cores and identify abrupt 1‰ enrichments in δ13C–CH4 synchronous with HE CH4 pulses and 0.5‰ δ13C–CH4 enrichments synchronous with DO CH4 increases. δD–CH4 varied little across the abrupt CH4 changes. Using box models to interpret these isotopic shifts6 and assuming a constant δ13C–CH4 of microbial emissions, we propose that abrupt shifts in tropical rainfall associated with HEs and DO events enhanced 13C-enriched pyrogenic CH4 emissions, and by extension global wildfire extent, by 90–150%. Carbon cycle box modelling experiments7 suggest that the resulting released terrestrial carbon could have caused from one-third to all of the abrupt CO2 increases associated with HEs. These findings suggest that fire regimes and the terrestrial carbon cycle varied contemporaneously and substantially with past abrupt climate changes of the last glacial period. An increase in wildfire extent and related greenhouse gas emissions can be linked to abrupt climatic changes during the last glacial period."

 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) last for milliseconds and arrive at Earth from cosmological distances. Although their origins and emission mechanisms are unknown, their signals bear similarities with the much less luminous radio emission generated by pulsars within our Miky Way Galaxy1, with properties suggesting neutron star origins2,3. However, unlike pulsars, FRBs typically show minimal variability in their linear polarization position angle (PA) curves4. Even when marked PA evolution is present, their curves deviate significantly from the canonical shape predicted by the rotating vector model (RVM) of pulsars5. Here we report on FRB 20221022A, detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst project (CHIME/FRB) and localized to a nearby host galaxy (about 65 Mpc), MCG+14-02-011. This FRB shows a notable approximately 130° PA rotation over its about 2.5 ms burst duration, resembling the characteristic S-shaped evolution seen in many pulsars and some radio magnetars. The observed PA evolution supports magnetospheric origins6–8 over models involving distant shocks9–11, echoing similar conclusions drawn from tempo-polarimetric studies of some repeating FRBs12,13. The PA evolution is well described by the RVM and, although we cannot determine the inclination and magnetic obliquity because of the unknown period or duty cycle of the source, we exclude very short-period pulsars (for example, recycled millisecond pulsars) as the progenitor.

 The dynamics of the genetic diversity of pathogens, including the emergence of lineages with increased fitness, is a foundational concept of disease ecology with key public-health implications. However, the identification of such lineages and estimation of associated fitness remain challenging, and is rarely done outside densely sampled systems1,2. Here we present phylowave, a scalable approach that summarizes changes in population composition in phylogenetic trees, enabling the automatic detection of lineages based on shared fitness and evolutionary relationships. We use our approach on a broad set of viruses and bacteria (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A subtype H3N2, Bordetella pertussis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), which include both well-studied and understudied threats to human health. We show that phylowave recovers the main known circulating lineages for each pathogen and that it can detect specific amino acid changes linked to fitness changes. Furthermore, phylowave identifies previously undetected lineages with increased fitness, including three co-circulating B. pertussis lineages. Inference using phylowave is robust to uneven and limited observations. This widely applicable approach provides an avenue to monitor evolution in real time to support public-health action and explore fundamental drivers of pathogen fitness.

 Lung metastases occur in up to 54% of patients with metastatic tumours1,2. Contributing factors to this high frequency include the physical properties of the pulmonary system and a less oxidative environment that may favour the survival of cancer cells3. Moreover, secreted factors from primary tumours alter immune cells and the extracellular matrix of the lung, creating a permissive pre-metastatic environment primed for the arriving cancer cells4,5. Nutrients are also primed during pre-metastatic niche formation6. Yet, whether and how nutrients available in organs in which tumours metastasize confer cancer cells with aggressive traits is mostly undefined. Here we found that pulmonary aspartate triggers a cellular signalling cascade in disseminated cancer cells, resulting in a translational programme that boosts aggressiveness of lung metastases. Specifically, we observe that patients and mice with breast cancer have high concentrations of aspartate in their lung interstitial fluid. This extracellular aspartate activates the ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor in cancer cells, which promotes CREB-dependent expression of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). DOHH is essential for hypusination, a post-translational modification that is required for the activity of the non-classical translation initiation factor eIF5A. In turn, a translational programme with TGFβ signalling as a central hub promotes collagen synthesis in lung-disseminated breast cancer cells. We detected key proteins of this mechanism in lung metastases from patients with breast cancer. In summary, we found that aspartate, a classical biosynthesis metabolite, functions in the lung environment as an extracellular signalling molecule to promote aggressiveness of metastases. Aspartate in the tumour environment activates the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor in cancer cells to induce cellular programmes that increase the aggressiveness of metastasis."

 In organisms ranging from vertebrates to plants, major components of centromeres are rapidly evolving repeat sequences, such as tandem repeats (TRs) and transposable elements (TEs), which harbour centromere-specific histone H3 (CENH3)1,2. Complete centromere structures recently determined in human and Arabidopsis suggest frequent integration and purging of retrotransposons within the TR regions of centromeres3–5. Despite the high impact of ‘centrophilic’ retrotransposons on the paradox of rapid centromere evolution, the mechanisms involved in centromere targeting remain poorly understood in any organism. Here we show that both Ty3 and Ty1 long terminal repeat retrotransposons rapidly turnover within the centromeric TRs of Arabidopsis species. We demonstrate that the Ty1/Copia element Tal1 (Transposon of Arabidopsis lyrata 1) integrates de novo into regions occupied by CENH3 in Arabidopsis thaliana, and that ectopic expansion of the CENH3 region results in spread of Tal1 integration regions. The integration spectra of chimeric TEs reveal the key structural variations responsible for contrasting chromatin-targeting specificities to centromeres versus gene-rich regions, which have recurrently converted during the evolution of these TEs.

 Yellowstone Caldera is one of the largest volcanic systems on Earth, hosting three major caldera-forming eruptions in the past two million years, interspersed with periods of less explosive, smaller-volume eruptions1. Caldera-forming eruptions at Yellowstone are sourced by rhyolitic melts stored within the mid- to upper crust. Seismic tomography studies have suggested that a broad region of rhyolitic melt extends beneath Yellowstone Caldera, with an estimated melt volume that is one to four times greater than the eruptive volume of the largest past caldera-forming eruption, and an estimated melt fraction of 6–28 per cent2–5. Seismic velocity is strongly influenced by temperature, pressure and melt; however, magnetotelluric data are primarily sensitive to the presence of melt, making these data ideal for constraining volcanic systems. Here we utilize magnetotelluric data to model the resistivity structure of Yellowstone Caldera’s crustal magma reservoir and constrain the region’s potential for producing major volcanic eruptions. We find that rhyolitic melts are stored in segregated regions beneath the caldera with low melt fractions, indicating that the reservoirs are not eruptible. Typically, these regions have melt volumes equivalent to small-volume post-caldera Yellowstone eruptions. The largest region of rhyolitic melt storage, concentrated beneath northeast Yellowstone Caldera, has a storage volume similar to the eruptive volume of Yellowstone’s smallest caldera-forming eruption. We identify regions of basalt migrating from the lower crust, merging with and supplying heat to the northeast region of rhyolitic melt storage. On the basis of our analysis, we suggest that the locus of future rhyolitic volcanism has shifted to northeast Yellowstone Caldera.

 Recently acquired memories are reactivated in the hippocampus during sleep, an initial step for their consolidation1–3. This process is concomitant with the hippocampal reactivation of previous memories4–6, posing the problem of how to prevent interference between older and recent, initially labile, memory traces. Theoretical work has suggested that consolidating multiple memories while minimizing interference can be achieved by randomly interleaving their reactivation7–10. An alternative is that a temporal microstructure of sleep can promote the reactivation of different types of memories during specific substates. Here, to test these two hypotheses, we developed a method to simultaneously record large hippocampal ensembles and monitor sleep dynamics through pupillometry in naturally sleeping mice. Oscillatory pupil fluctuations revealed a previously unknown microstructure of non-REM sleep-associated memory processes. We found that memory replay of recent experiences dominated in sharp-wave ripples during contracted pupil substates of non-REM sleep, whereas replay of previous memories preferentially occurred during dilated pupil substates. Selective closed-loop disruption of sharp-wave ripples during contracted pupil non-REM sleep impaired the recall of recent memories, whereas the same manipulation during dilated pupil substates had no behavioural effect. Stronger extrinsic excitatory inputs characterized the contracted pupil substate, whereas higher recruitment of local inhibition was prominent during dilated pupil substates. Thus, the microstructure of non-REM sleep organizes memory replay, with previous versus new memories being temporally segregated in different substates and supported by local and input-driven mechanisms, respectively. Our results suggest that the brain can multiplex distinct cognitive processes during sleep to facilitate continuous learning without interference.

 The seasonal cycle, responsible for much of the temperature variability in the upper ocean, exerts profound climatic and ecological influence. While surface intensification of temperature seasonality has been widely examined, changes beneath the ocean surface remain unknown. Here we analyze multiple ocean temperature datasets, revealing a robust, substantial weakening of subsurface seasonality by 5.7 ± 1.8% below the mixed layer in extratropical oceans since the 1980s. Using a hierarchy of climate models and an idealized diffusive model, we attribute this weakening to increased ocean heat uptake driven by rising greenhouse gases.

 Satellite technologies are essential for global conservation actions through providing continuous, real-time Earth monitoring. However, development of these technologies necessitates an increase in rocket launches, which introduces new threats to biodiversity. Here, we mapped rocket launch sites and assessed their threats on protected areas and terrestrial biodiversity. Our analysis revealed that over 90% launch sites are within areas where unprotected habitats excesses 50% and over 62% of operating sites are located within or near protected areas. The threats from rocket launches are potentially associated with biomes, coordinates, and proximity to oceans. In particular, threatened terrestrial species in Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests are more vulnerable to these risks compared to species in other biomes. Without strategic planning, the continued growth of rocket launches could create conflicts between technological development and conservation efforts, undermining the achievement of UN Biodiversity Goals.

 Forest-based carbon sequestration projects incentivize reforestation and restoration activities while offering opportunities to realize co-benefits such as biodiversity conservation. While conservation aspects are increasingly emphasized in these projects, the rigor of biodiversity co-benefit verification has been highly variable. Recent advances in biodiversity monitoring based on shed DNA in the environment (eDNA) offer promise for improving effectiveness, standardization, and transparency. Here we analyze 129 forest carbon projects and 396 peer-reviewed studies to identify how biodiversity co-benefits are currently verified within forest carbon markets, and to evaluate the potential of eDNA for tracking biodiversity change. Our analysis revealed that eDNA studies focused more on smaller organisms (microbes and invertebrates) and on temperate ecosystems compared with biodiversity-focused forest carbon projects. Efforts to align these two worlds via investments into broadening the geographic and taxonomic scope could allow greater adoption and increased accountability in biodiversity monitoring within forest carbon markets (i.e. standardized, auditable biodiversity data trails). Adapting advancements in eDNA technology to the biodiversity monitoring needs of nature-based initiatives will aid countries and organizations striving to meet global conservation commitments.

 Under climate change, temperature extremes have become more frequent and intense in recent decades, both in the atmosphere and in the ocean with devastating impacts on ecosystems and succeeding socioeconomic consequences. This is particularly true in climate change hotspots such as the Mediterranean region, where spatiotemporal compounding of extreme phenomena is becoming the norm. In the framework of a new spatiotemporal approach to heatwave detection, which tracks the evolution of the phenomena throughout their life cycle, the concurrence of marine and atmospheric heatwaves is investigated in this study. Concurrency of both phenomena in time and space shows a relevant impact on the intensity of the marine heatwaves, while no relevant changes are observed in atmospheric heat waves. Therefore, we demonstrate that intensification in extreme temperature events is accompanied by the added local intensification effect of marine heatwaves when concurring with atmospheric heatwaves, especially in recent years.

 Stand structure influences the distribution of light and water and thus affects the functioning of forest ecosystems.

Here we use principal component analysis to derive a stand structural indicator (SSI) index based on four structural metrics derived from GEDI covering tropical forests and upscale the GEDI footprint-level SSI to a spatially continuous distribution using Sentinel-1&2 imagery. The majority of high SSI values representing higher forest height, density and diversity of canopy height, is found for all tropical forest areas in moist regions, natural forests, and regions with less fire activity. We show that SSI is positively correlated with primary productivity and that the sensitivity of productivity to SSI is larger in natural forests than in managed forests.

 Automatic collection of tree-level crown information is essential for sustainable forest management and fine carbon stock estimation. UAV-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and UAV-based multi-angle photogrammetry (UMP) data depict the 3D structure of forests at a fine-grained level by generating detailed point clouds, making them potential alternatives to labor-intensive forest inventories. However, the accuracy of the individual tree crown segmentation algorithms that have been developed is unstable in forest stands with high terrain undulation and high canopy density, mainly due to the various crown sizes and interlocking crowns resulting in varying degrees of over- or under-segmentation. Here, we propose self-similarity cluster grouping (SCG) algorithm for individual tree crown segmentation that integrates multivariable calculus of crown surfaces and spectral-texture-color spatial information of crown. Firstly, according to the property that DSM and its multi-order gradient information can characterize the crown surface variation and concavity-convexity features, first- and second-order edge detection operators were used to preliminarily determine the crown patch edges in order to reduce under-segmentation. Then, we developed a self-similarity weight function controlled by the spectral, texture and color spatial information of the tree crown patches to increase the similarity difference between adjacent crown patches of the same tree and those of neighboring trees, and designed the strategy for cluster grouping crown patches to complete individual tree crown segmentation. The performance of the proposed SCG algorithm was verified in Mytilaria, Red oatchestnu, Chinese fir and Eucalyptus plots in subtropical forests of China using LiDAR and UMP data. The overall accuracy of F-score (f) was above 0.85 for crown segmentation, and the rRMSE for crown width, crown area and crown circumference extractions reached 0.13, 0.22 and 0.14, respectively. On this basis, we evaluated the effect of spatial resolution of DSM on the segmentation accuracy of SCG algorithm, and found that the crown segmentation accuracy was proportional to the spatial resolution. Compared to the normalized cut algorithm, marker-controlled watershed algorithm and threshold-based cloud point segmentation algorithm, the SCG algorithm improved the overall accuracy f of individual tree crown segmentation by 0.06, 0.13 and 0.05 for LiDAR and 0.06, 0.21 and 0.10 for UMP, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness and generalizability of the SCG algorithm was verified in other Mytilaria, Red oatchestnut, Chinese fir and Eucalyptus plots in subtropical forests and Larch and Chinese pine plots in temperate forests using UMP data. The crown segmentation accuracy was better than 0.82, and the crown width extraction accuracy was up to 89 %. Overall, our proposed SCG algorithm reduces the over- and under-segmentation in complex forest structures and provides technical support for accurate crown information extraction at both plot and forest stand levels."

 Recently, Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content has declined across global Mollisols region due to erosion, intensive agriculture, and other factors, weakening the soil's capacity to buffer climate change and necessitating urgent monitoring of SOC dynamics. Large-scale SOC content monitoring using remote sensing technology faces challenges in extracting advanced features from remote sensing data and mitigating the negative impact of high spatial heterogeneity in SOC content on prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, we collected 8984 samples, 956,423 Landsat TM/OLI images, shuttle radar topography mission-digital elevation model data, and meteorological data. We developed a Geographic Knowledge Dataset (GEKD) incorporating prior knowledge of soil formation and erosion processes. We then input the GEKD into a Probability Hybrid Model (PHM). In the PHM, we applied a fuzzy Gaussian mixture model to cluster the global Mollisols region and calculate corresponding probabilities. We then built a high-accuracy SOC content prediction model by integrating the Attention mechanism, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (A-CNN-ConvLSTM). Finally, we generated spatial maps of SOC content at a 30 m resolution for 8 periods since 1984 and verified the accuracy of its spatial distribution and temporal variation patterns. The results showed that (1) the highest SOC content prediction accuracy (RMSE = 7.17 g/kg, R2 = 0.72, and RPIQ = 1.92) was achieved when GEKD was input into PHM using the A-CNN-ConvLSTM algorithm. (2) PHM effectively reduces the negative impact of high SOC spatial heterogeneity on prediction accuracy, resulting in smoother spatial distribution at cluster boundaries. Compared to the global model, PHM reduced RMSE by 1.66 g/kg and improved R2 and RPIQ by 0.06 and 0.15, respectively. (3) Compared to the commonly used random forest algorithm, A-CNN-ConvLSTM reduced RMSE by 1.50 g/kg and improved R2 and RPIQ by 0.13 and 0.47, respectively. The spatial context features extracted by the CNN structure in the A-CNN-ConvLSTM algorithm are the most effective in improving SOC content prediction accuracy. (4) Currently, the SOC content across continents in the global Mollisols region is ranked as follows: Siberia (27.21 g/kg) > Europe (26.78 g/kg) > Asia (20.48 g/kg) > North America (20.43 g/kg) > South America (16.49 g/kg). Since 1984, SOC content has shown a decreasing trend, with the global Mollisols region losing 1.91 g/kg overall. The Asian Mollisols region experienced the largest decline (2.93 g/kg), while Siberia saw the smallest decrease (1.45 g/kg)."

 The importance of water resources in supporting food production is ever increasing, especially in the face of climate change, urbanization and population growth. This study aims to map and analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of irrigated agricultural areas to support improved planning of irrigation water and irrigation sector in Nepal. Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) employing Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, this study classifies and analyzes change in irrigated and rainfed areas over the past two decades. NDVI time series analysis across different physiographic regions uncovered two cropping cycles annually in the Terai and Siwalik regions. In contrast, predominantly a single cropping cycle was observed in the Middle and High Mountain regions. The k-means clustering algorithm was applied to NDVI time series within the agriculture land use database of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) for Nepal. The obtained irrigated areas distribution were also analyzed across different provinces of Nepal as provinces are the main functional administrative divisions after federal level that are responsible for irrigation development. The produced irrigation areas distribution showed reasonable accuracy as compared to the statistical irrigation areas database of the Department of Water Resources and Irrigation (DWRI), Nepal. The results showed that, on average, approximately 60% (2.18 million hectares) of agricultural land was irrigated annually over the past decade.

 Temperature inversion is an important meteorological phenomenon that affects the diffusion and migration of air pollutants. To forecast air quality accurately, it is essential to understand the characteristics, formation, and dissipation mechanisms of temperature inversion. The sounding data used in this study came from 24 radiosonde stations in northwest China. We systematically analyzed the characteristics of inversions and their effects on air pollution in northwest China. Additionally, we developed a conceptual model of inversion formation mechanisms over the region's complex underlying surfaces. The results indicated that inversions are prevalent throughout the year in northwest China, occurring more frequently at 08:00 Beijing time than at 20:00. The annual average number of inversion days across multiple stations is 330.4 days, with an average inversion strength of 1.20 °C/100 m and an average inversion depth of 291.2 m. The spatial distribution of the number of inversion days, strength and depth in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region is smaller than that in the Arid region of northwest China and the Eastern monsoon marginal zone. The occurrence of inversions in Northwest China exacerbates air pollution, demonstrating with inversions accounted for more than 70% of the days of occurrence in the daily statistics of air pollution. In particular, SBIs(surface-based inversions) and NSIs(near-surface inversions) have a significant impact on air pollution. Both representative indicators of air pollution, PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, exhibited parabolic relationships with inversion strength. The PM2.5 concentration reached its maximum value (108.27 μg/m³) at an inversion strength of 1.51 °C/100m, showing a linear positive correlation with inversion depth and a negative correlation with O3 concentration. The formation of inversions in northwest China is primarily influenced by two factors: the concave topography and the unique geographic environment of the Tibetan Plateau, and the atmospheric circulation. These findings provide a scientific basis for understanding the structural characteristics of inversions in northwest China and for developing strategies to mitigate air pollution."

We used single-cell analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from rhesus macaques vaccinated via different routes and doses of BCG to identify alterations in the immune ecosystem in the airway following vaccination. Our findings reveal that high-dose intravenous BCG induces an influx of polyfunctional T cells and macrophages in the airways, with alveolar macrophages from high-dose intravenous BCG displaying a basal activation state in the absence of purified protein derivative stimulation, defined in part by interferon signaling.

Recent advancements have revealed the heterogeneous distribution of TF molecules, posing challenges to precisely decoding concentration signals. Using high-resolution single-cell imaging of the fluorescently tagged TF Bicoid in livingDrosophilaembryos, we show that Bicoid accumulation in submicrometer clusters preserves the spatial information of the maternal Bicoid gradient. These clusters provide precise spatial cues through intensity, size, and frequency. We further discover that Bicoid target genes colocalize with these clusters in an enhancer-binding affinity-dependent manner. Our modeling suggests that clustering offers a faster sensing mechanism for global nuclear concentrations than freely diffusing TF molecules detected by simple enhancers."

To determine the impact of somatic mtDNA mutations on this process, we assessed the leukemogenic potential of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from mtDNA mutator mice (Polg D257A) with or without NMyc overexpression. We observed a higher incidence of spontaneous leukemogenesis in recipients transplanted with heterozygous Polg HPCs and a lower incidence of NMyc-driven leukemia in those with homozygous Polg HPCs compared to controls. Although mtDNA mutations in heterozygous and homozygous HPCs caused similar baseline impairments in mitochondrial function, only heterozygous HPCs responded to and supported altered metabolic demands associated with NMyc overexpression. Homozygous HPCs showed altered glucose utilization with pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition due to increased phosphorylation, exacerbated by NMyc overexpression. The impaired growth of NMyc-expressing homozygous HPCs was partially rescued by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, highlighting a relationship between mtDNA mutation burden and metabolic plasticity in leukemogenesis."

These CMSSCs are marked by interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) and are specifically located around the periosteum of the jawbone and frontal bone. Additionally, these CMSSCs exhibit strong self-renewal and osteogenic differentiation capacities but lower chondrogenic differentiation potency, mediating intramembranous bone formation without cartilage formation. IFITM5+cells are also observed in the adult jawbone and exhibit functions similar to those of embryonic CMSSCs.

During late infection, EBOV virions are on the skin’s surface; however, the permissive skin cell types and the route of virus translocation to the epidermal surface are unknown. We describe a human skin explant model and demonstrate that EBOV infection of human skin via basal media increases in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. In the dermis, cells of myeloid, endothelial, and fibroblast origin were EBOV antigen–positive whereas keratinocytes harbored virus in the epidermis. Infectious virus was detected on the apical epidermal surface within 3 days, indicating that virus propagates and traffics through the explants. Purified human fibroblasts and keratinocytes supported EBOV infection ex vivo and both cell types required the phosphatidylserine receptor, AXL, and the endosomal protein, NPC1, for virus entry. This platform identified susceptible cell types and demonstrated dynamic trafficking of EBOV virions. These findings may explain person-to-person transmission via skin contact."

How this diversity evolves remains elusive. We discovered within-cell variation in the recruitment of the major centromere protein CenH3, reminiscent of variation typically observed among species. While CenH3-containing nucleosomes are distributed in a monocentric fashion on autosomes and bind tandem repeat sequences specific to individual or groups of chromosomes, they show a longitudinal distribution and broad intergenic binding on the X chromosome, which partially recapitulates phenotypes known from holocentric species. Despite this variable CenH3 distribution among chromosomes, all chromosomes are functionally monocentric, marking the first instance of a monocentric species with chromosome-wide CenH3 deposition.

Here, we investigated information processing within each hemisphere over time and the degree to which it is distinct or duplicated across hemispheres. We presented participants with object images lateralized to the left or right visual fields while measuring their brain activity with electroencephalography. Stimulus coding was more robust and emerged earlier in the contralateral than the ipsilateral hemisphere. Presentation of two stimuli, one to each hemifield, reduced the fidelity of representations in both hemispheres relative to one stimulus alone, signifying hemispheric interference. Last, we found that processing within the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, hemisphere was biased to image-related over concept-related information.

The apparent long-range tetragonal structure that can be recovered to ambient conditions is only the configurational ensemble average of the underlying orthorhombic domains.

Here, we conducted a pan-tissue analysis of the dynamics of seven key histone modifications during human aging. Our histone-specific age prediction models showed surprisingly accurate performance, proving resilient to experimental and artificial noise. Simulation experiments for comparison with DNA methylation age predictors revealed competitive performance. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis uncovered several critical developmental pathways for age prediction. Different from DNA methylation age predictors, genes known to be involved in aging biology are among the most important ones for the models. Last, we developed a pan-tissue pan-histone age predictor, suggesting that age-related epigenetic information is degenerated across the epigenome. This research highlights the power of histone marks as input for creating robust age predictors and opens avenues for understanding the role of epigenetic changes during aging."

Here, we show that mice exposed to methamphetamine in drinking water develop infradian locomotor rhythms with periods of 48 hours and beyond which extend to sleep length and manic state–associated behaviors in support of a model for cycling in BD. The cycling capacity is abrogated upon genetic disruption of dopamine (DA) production in DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or ablation of nucleus accumbens projecting DA neurons. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation ofVTADA neurons including those that project to the nucleus accumbens led to locomotor period lengthening in circadian clock–deficient mice, which was counteracted by antipsychotic treatment. Together, our findings argue that BD cycling relies on infradian rhythm generation that depends on mesolimbic DA neurons."

The mid-to-late-stage evolution of the lunar magnetic field is poorly constrained, and thus, the existence of a long-lived lunar dynamo remains controversial. The Chang’e-5 mission returned the heretofore youngest mare basalts from Oceanus Procellarum uniquely positioned at midlatitude. We recovered weak paleointensities of ~2 to 4 microtesla from the Chang’e-5 basalt clasts at 2 billion years ago, attesting to the longevity of the lunar dynamo until at least the Moon’s midstage. This paleomagnetic result implies the existence of thermal convection in the lunar deep interior at the lunar midstage, which may have supplied mantle heat flux for young volcanism."

A challenge with autonomous accelerator tuning remains that the most capable algorithms require experts in optimization and machine learning to implement them for every new tuning task. Here, we propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to tune particle accelerators. We demonstrate on a proof-of-principle example the ability of LLMs to tune an accelerator subsystem based on only a natural language prompt from the operator, and compare their performance to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning–trained optimization. In doing so, we also show how LLMs can perform numerical optimization of a nonlinear real-world objective. Ultimately, this work represents another complex task that LLMs can solve and promises to help accelerate the deployment of autonomous tuning algorithms to day-to-day particle accelerator operations."

Here, we examined the roles of prefrontal vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)–expressing neurons and their D1 receptors (D1Rs) in working memory using a delayed match-to-sample task in mice. VIP neurons conveyed robust working-memory signals, and their inactivation impaired behavioral performance. Moreover, selective knockdown of D1Rs in VIP neurons also resulted in impaired performance, indicating the critical role of VIP neurons and their D1Rs in supporting working memory. Additionally, we found that dopamine release dynamics during the delay period varied depending on the target location. Furthermore, dopaminergic terminal stimulation induced a contralateral response bias and enhanced neuronal target selectivity in a laterality-dependent manner. These results suggest that prefrontal dopamine modulates behavioral responses and delay-period activity based on laterality. Overall, these findings shed light on dopamine-modulated prefrontal neural processes underlying higher-order cognitive functions."

Finding the optimal design is challenging: Generically, these problems are highly nonconvex and finding global optima is NP hard. Here, we show that the associated optimization problem can be transformed to a sparse-matrix, quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). Sparse QCQPs can be tackled with convex optimization techniques (such as semidefinite programming) that have thrived for identifying global bounds and high-performance designs in many areas of science and engineering but seemed inapplicable to the design problems of wave physics. We apply our formulation to prototypical photonic design problems, showing the possibility to compute fundamental limits for large-area metasurfaces, as well as the identification of designs approaching global optimality. Our approach appears directly extensible to any design problem whose governing dynamics are bilinear differential equations, as arise in structural optimization, fluid dynamics, and quantum control."

Underlying mechanisms and the role of muscle lipid distribution and composition on glucose metabolism remain unclear. We compared highly trained athletes (ATHL) with sedentary normal weight (LEAN) and overweight-to-obese (OVWE) male and female individuals. This observational study found that ATHL show higher insulin sensitivity, muscle mitochondrial content, and capacity, but lower activation of novel protein kinase C (nPKC) isoforms, despite higher diacylglycerol concentrations. Notably, sedentary but insulin sensitive OVWE feature lower plasma membrane-to-mitochondriasn-1,2-diacylglycerol ratios. In ATHL, calpain-2, which cleaves nPKC, negatively associates with PKCε activation and positively with insulin sensitivity along with higher GLUT4 and hexokinase II content. These findings contribute to explaining the athletes’ paradox by demonstrating lower nPKC activation, increased calpain, and mitochondrial partitioning of bioactive diacylglycerols, the latter further identifying an obesity subtype with increased insulin sensitivity (NCT03314714)."

Odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) mutants show enhanced attraction to human skin temperature and increased heat-evoked neuronal activity in foreleg sensory neurons.Ir140, a foreleg-enriched member of the ionotropic receptor (IR) superfamily of sensory receptors, is up-regulated inOrcomutant legs.Ir140,Orcodouble mutants do not show the enhanced heat seeking seen inOrcosingle mutants, suggesting that up-regulation ofIr140in the foreleg is a key mechanism underlying sensory compensation inOrcomutants. BecauseOrcoexpression is sparse in legs, this sensory compensation requires an indirect, long-range mechanism. Our findings highlight how femaleAedes aegyptimosquitoes, despite suffering olfactory sensory loss, maintain the overall effectiveness of their host-seeking behavior by up-regulating attraction to human skin temperature, further enhancing their status as the most dangerous predator of humans."

Each cell within a fracture site resides within different local microenvironments characterized by different levels of mechanical strain; thus, preserving the spatial location of each cell is critical in relating cellular responses to mechanical stimuli. Our spatial transcriptomics–based “mechanomics” platform facilitates spatially resolved analysis of the molecular profiles of cells with respect to their local in vivo mechanical environment by integrating time-lapsed in vivo micro–computed tomography, spatial transcriptomics, and micro–finite element analysis. We investigate the transcriptomic responses of cells as a function of the local strain magnitude by identifying the differential expression of genes in regions of high and low strain within a fracture site. Our platform thus has the potential to address fundamental open questions within the field and to discover mechano-responsive targets to enhance fracture healing."

To date, it is unknown how extracellular fluid viscosity affects hMSC function on substrates of different stiffness and viscoelasticity. While hMSCs assume an adipogenic phenotype on gels of low stiffness and prescribed stress relaxation times, elevated fluid viscosity is sufficient to bias hMSCs toward an osteogenic phenotype. Elevated viscosity induces Arp2/3-dependent actin remodeling, enhances NHE1 activity, and promotes hMSC spreading via up-regulation of integrin-linked kinase. The resulting increase in membrane tension triggers the activation of transient receptor potential cation vanilloid 4 to facilitate calcium influx, thereby stimulating RhoA/ROCK and driving YAP-dependent RUNX2 translocation to the nucleus, leading to osteogenic differentiation. hMSCs on soft gels at elevated relative to basal viscosity favor an M2 macrophage phenotype. This study establishes fluid viscosity as a key physical cue that imprints osteogenic memory in hMSCs and promotes an immunosuppressive phenotype."

Through rigorous analysis, APLP1+EVs from human sera were unequivocally determined to be of cerebral origin. This assertion was corroborated by distinctive small RNA expression patterns of APLP1+EVs. The miRNAs’ putative targets within these EVs manifested pronounced expression in the brain, fortifying their neurospecific provenance. We subjected our findings to stringent validation using Thy-1 GFP M line mice, transgenic models wherein GFP expression is confined to hippocampal neurons.
