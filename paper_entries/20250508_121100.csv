10.1088/1748-9326/adc8bd,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注气候变化对澳大利亚复合干旱热浪事件的影响，侧重于使用气候模型预测和分析干旱和热浪的发生频率、持续时间和严重程度。虽然研究涉及大气温度和降水等气象要素，但它不直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,[],Sarah Chapman;Ralph Trancoso;Jozef Syktus;Rohan Eccles;Nathan Toombs,Impacts on compound drought heatwave events in Australia per global warming level,"Droughts and heatwaves are amongst the most frequent hazards in Australia. They cause severe impacts to society and the environment, and the magnitude of impacts increase when they are compounded- occurring simultaneously or sequentially. Using CMIP6 projections dynamically downscaled with the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model to a 10 km resolution over Australia, we examine the impact of climate change on compound drought heatwave events (CDHWs). We define droughts using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and for heatwaves use the Excess Heat Factor. In the historical period, most models capture the temperature-precipitation correlation well, however, most fail to capture the observed strengthening of this relationship over time. The models also over-estimate the number of CDHWs. In the historical period, the choice of SPEI or SPI has little impact on CDHWs, however for climate change impacts, using SPEI results in more severe impacts with less uncertainty. Under SSP370, by the end of the century, for SPEI CDHWs, there are around 3 more events/year, versus little change for SPI CDHWs. However, the duration of both events increase by around 3 days. A global warming level (GWL) analysis shows spikes in impacts when moving from 2 to 3°C, with a doubling in the number of SPEI CDHWs for Northern Australia. Moving from 3 to 4°C of warming, the length of SPEI CDHWs increases from 8 to 13 days in Northern Australia. This highlights the urgent need to reduce emissions to avoid more than 2°C of warming. A storyline analysis reveals that even in a wetter future, CDHWs will increase due to increasing temperatures and heatwaves, showing that as the climate warms, CDHWs are likely to increase despite uncertainty in precipitation projections. This research applies a novel approach to examine CDHWs using downscaled climate simulations, considering two drought metrics, GWLs and storylines, offering new insights to disentangle uncertainty in future compound extreme events."
10.1088/1748-9326/adcc43,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了气溶胶和土地利用/土地覆盖变化对印度夏季风的影响。虽然它没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或特定的卫星观测，但它分析了气溶胶对降水、能量平衡和水循环的影响，这些都是大气环境遥感可以监测和研究的关键要素。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术间接相关，因为它提供了关于大气成分（特别是气溶胶）如何影响气候系统的见解，而这些成分可以通过遥感技术进行观测和分析。,"['aerosols', 'Indian summer monsoon', 'land-use/land-cover change', 'precipitation', 'energy budget', 'water cycle', 'surface temperature', 'moist static energy']",R Puri;A Giannini,Differences and similarities in Indian monsoon response to aerosols and to land-use/land-cover change,"Aerosols are known to exert a powerful influence on the Indian summer monsoon, reducing precipitation from onset through demise. We analyze model simulations aimed at detection and attribution to compare and contrast the processes that affect the energy budget and water cycle in the presence of aerosols to those associated with land-use/land-cover change (LULCC) over the Indian subcontinent. We find that the response of the water cycle to these external forcings is remarkably similar: precipitation decreases in the presence of either aerosols or LULCC. We also find that this occurs despite opposite responses in the surface energy budget, manifest in surface temperature: aerosols cool the continent, while LULCC warms it. Consequently, the temperature contrast set up by the difference in thermal inertia between land and ocean at peak insolation is weakened in the aerosol case, but it is strengthened in the LULCC case. These results therefore support the perspective that has forcefully emerged in tropical climate dynamics in the past couple decades that the temperature contrast between land and ocean alone is not sufficient to explain variation in monsoon rains. In line with this perspective, we find that viewing humidity as an expression of energy on par with temperature, that is, considering the moist static energy contrast, is critical to explaining outcome. In the simulations analyzed here, the presence of either aerosols or LULCC coherently reduces moist static energy over land, weakening the contrast between land and ocean, and results in reduced precipitation, confirming the monsoon’s sensitivity to external forcing."

Several reviews have explored historic associations between meteorological factors and diarrheal diseases, but none have evaluated the literature on projections of future trends. We summarize climate change-attributable projections of diarrheal diseases, appraise study methods and results, and examine evidence for adaptation strategies. We searched Web of Science and PubMed databases for terms related to diarrhea, dysentery, and projected climate change through February 2024 and included studies with future projections of climate-related diarrhea burden. We summarized range of projected percent change in future diarrheal disease relative to study baseline, stratified by economic context, pathogen, time period, and emission scenario. We assessed modeling approaches and quality of evidence for included studies. We screened 2949 records, reviewed full text for 105, and ultimately included 35. There was substantial heterogeneity in study approaches, for example types of models implemented, exposure and outcomes considered, covariates included, and adaptation or vulnerability scenarios examined. The majority of studies indicated an increase in future diarrheal diseases in the near (2020–40), mid (2040–2060) and long term (2060+) due to climate change, despite overall downward trends in diarrhea rates globally. There was substantial heterogeneity in study approaches. High baseline burdens translated to large increases, even under conservative assumptions about temperature sensitivities and emissions. Projected increases by percent change from baseline were greatest in high-income countries and low-and middle-income countries, and increased in size with increasing severity of emissions scenarios modeled. There were no studies in LICs. Viral pathogen estimates tended to decrease in a warming climate while bacterial pathogens estimates tended to increase. Most studies included multiple emissions scenarios and accounted for future population change, but few incorporated adaptation strategies or changes in underlying population vulnerability. When stratified, studies that considered future adaptation and vulnerability estimated higher projections of future burden compared to studies that did not. Climate change has the potential to increase diarrhea burden, absent adaptation. Diarrhea is heavily dependent on the underlying development context, so explicit inclusion of assumptions on future development factors, including population exposure, vulnerability, and adaptation, is essential for projections of climate-related diarrhea burden. Scenarios such as the shared socioeconomic pathways can help align projections by standardizing modeling approaches and offering future population and economic storylines to be paired with emissions scenarios."

Meanwhile, it is a key driver of local and regional climate due to its influence on energy and water exchange between land surface and atmosphere. Despite the irrigation-induced evaporative cooling on temperature alone, how irrigation affects summer heat stress—a combination of temperature and humidity can become a concern to public health—is not well understood. This study examines the potential impacts of irrigation practices on summer temperature and heat extremes in the Great Plains using a set of sensitivity experiments conducted with the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model for 10 growing seasons. Results show that intensive irrigation lowers the ambient temperature, but the increased humidity from enhanced evapotranspiration, especially during the extreme hot and dry summers, can possibly elevate the risks of heat stress in the heavily irrigated area and its surroundings. The response of humid heat extremes to irrigation depends on the heat metrics used in the assessment. For variables like wet-bulb temperature, wet-bulb globe temperature, and equivalent temperature, irrigation leads to significantly intensified humid heat extremes by up to 5 °C and increased heatwave frequency by 3 events year−1. In contrast, metrics like the heat index and environmental stress index suggest that irrigation mitigates heat intensity by decreasing the temperature metrics by up to 1 °C. Given the importance of irrigation in Great Plains agriculture in a changing climate, these uncertainties underscore the urgent need to connect heat metrics with health outcomes to better address heat mitigation in rural communities."
10.1088/1748-9326/add02a,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是中亚地区秋季降温现象，以及积雪覆盖增加对这一现象的影响。研究重点在于积雪覆盖率的变化如何影响地表短波辐射，进而导致气温下降。虽然涉及气候变化和地表辐射，但与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有直接关联。研究的核心是气候变化背景下积雪与气温的相互作用，而非利用遥感技术手段分析大气环境。,"['snow cover', 'Eurasia', 'cooling trend', 'shortwave radiation']",Baofu Li;Fangshu Dong;Lishu Lian;Tao Pan;Weijun Sun;Bowen Sun;Yanfeng Chen;Yunqian Wang;Yanhua Qin;Minghu Ding,Recent increase in snow cover as a contributing driver to autumn cooling in central Eurasia,"In the context of global warming, autumn air temperatures in central Eurasia have exhibited a cooling trend over the past two decades. However, the extent to which snow cover contributes to the cooling remains unclear. This study reveals that despite a general decrease in global snow cover extent, the autumn snow cover percentage over central Eurasia has increased by 5.38% per decade in the past two decades. Quantitative assessments indicate that the contribution of this increase in snow cover to the observed cooling was 21.5%. We also found that the increase in snow cover leads to a reduction in net shortwave radiation, which is the primary mechanism of the cooling effect induced by snow cover. This study advances our understanding of the evolution of the global climate system and provides scientific support for addressing climate change."

When flood events occur in close succession, they pose significant challenges for emergency management due to limited recovery time between events. This study focuses on multi-peak (MP) floods, where peaks occur within hours to days. Using discharge data from 77 hydrometric stations in Northern Italy’s Po district, we examined statistical differences between MP and single-peak (SP) flood events and analyzed their seasonal patterns and generating mechanisms across diverse river regimes. We demonstrated that SP and MP events exhibit distinct statistical behaviors. The first type of events has more skewed distributions with heavy tails, while the second displays flatter distributions with lighter tails and higher mean values. Seasonal analyses suggest that MP floods in glacial and nival-pluvial regimes are influenced by glacier and snow melting, whereas those in the Padanian regime are driven by tributary routing effects. These triggering mechanisms seem to be responsible of the lighter tails of the distribution of MP floods. By highlighting the distinct statistical behaviors and generating mechanisms of MP and SP floods, we identified recommendations for designing MP flood hydrograph, supporting flood-risk management."

Data are needed to better understand the relative impact of a changing climate across life course strata and ultimately inform effective adaptation strategies. Using the UK September 2023 heatwave as a case study, we surveyed 3242 participants from the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children about their lived experience of extreme heat. Responses evidenced perceived adverse impacts on sleep quality (67% of the participants), productivity at home (41%), appetite (29%), and productivity at work (25%). Beneficial impacts were perceived for mood (39% of the participants) and physical health (20%). Demographic (age and gender) and socio-economic variables (employment status and housing type) were associated with differences in the reported heat effects for lived experience of sleep quality, productivity at home and mood. Participants who were female, ⩽34 years of age, and unemployed/not working, perceived ‘a lot worse’ impacts on sleep quality in greater numbers than other sub-groups (age: 25% ⩽ 34 versus 10% ⩾ 65; gender: 21% female versus 10% male; employment status: 37% unemployed/not working versus 19% employed). These groups, as well as people living in flats, are also perceived ‘a lot and slightly worse’ impacts on productivity at home and mood, more often than other sub-groups. Despite the majority of the (82%) participants reporting awareness of the UK Health Security Agency and Met Office amber heat-health alerts, only 34% reported taking adaptive measures. Understanding the physiological and socio-economic drivers behind the experience of extreme heat is crucial for building resilience. Established cohort studies can be usefully employed to rapidly measure impact and variation in response."

However, the impact of changing snow dynamics on drought propagation time (tP) has rarely been assessed. Utilizing observed streamflow and reanalyzed climate data from ∼900 northern snow-affected catchments, here we provide a comprehensive investigation on temporal changes in tP and underlying mechanisms in the context of diminishing snow. Results show that catchments with a higher fraction of precipitation falling as snow (fs) exhibit a longer tP compared to catchments with marginal snowfall. Over the past 70 years, tP has significantly decreased following decreased fs, indicating accelerated drought propagation in a snow-diminishing world. Specifically, for catchments with lower mean annual fs ( ⩽ 30%), tP is decreasing at a rate of −0.8 d per decade. In contrast, for catchments with higher ( > 50%), tP is decreasing at a rate of −3.4 d per decade, four times faster than the rate observed in low- catchments. This acceleration is attributed to a reduced total snowmelt and slower snowmelt rate during the drought propagation process, which decreases streamflow recharge from snowmelt and increases evaporation losses. These findings are important for enhancing drought prediction and risk management in snow-affected regions."

Evidence from the EU 2040 climate target negotiation","The ongoing integration of novel carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods into climate policy has raised concerns that expectations of CDR may delay or undermine emission reduction efforts—a risk discussed as mitigation deterrence. Separating targets for emission reduction and CDR has emerged as a key policy proposal to address this risk, limiting the fungibility of emission reduction and CDR, and enabling critical assessment of the credibility and ambition of mitigation plans. However, stakeholder preferences and rationales as well as factors shaping political decisions on target separation have not been systematically analyzed to date. Here, we investigate the politics of the EU’s 2040 climate target design as a key conflict over how to deal with mitigation deterrence risks in climate policy-making through target separation. Drawing on data from the EU consultation process, document analysis, expert interviews and relevant online events, we find that a majority of stakeholders, including business actors, prefer separate targets over a net target, albeit based on different rationales. We also provide evidence on the political factors that led the European Commission to opt against target separation in its 2040 climate target communication. Our analysis suggests that the Commission perceived separate targets as too complex, inflexible, and potentially costly, particularly in light of a growing backlash to climate policy, concerns over growth and competitiveness, and pressures for legislative simplification and deregulation. Our results contribute to the emerging literature on the political economy of CDR and the empirics of mitigation deterrence and highlight the need to further explore how separate target designs can become politically feasible."

In this study, we investigate the tropical precipitation response to declining Arctic sea-ice using observations and climate model simulations. Observational evidence and idealized model experiments in which the Arctic becomes seasonally ice free under greenhouse warming reveal association between the Arctic sea-ice decline and intense precipitation events (IPEs) over South Asia. The enhanced Arctic sea-ice melt increases the mid-latitude waviness and intensifies the circumglobal teleconnection-like pattern and strengthens the subtropical high over East Asia. This, together with a La-Nina like response in the Pacific enhances mean summer monsoon precipitation over South Asia. Additionally, the enhanced energy in the tropics and the anomalous mid-latitude intrusions due to the Arctic sea-ice melt provide a conducive environment for moisture convergence and intense summer monsoon precipitation events over South Asia. Our findings reveal that, in a future warming scenario, Arctic sea-ice melt is likely a contributing factor for the amplified mean and IPEs over the South Asian region."

However, current models that predict this process vary greatly due to different methods and inaccuracies. We examined how nitrate forms in a global model, focusing on how gases condense on dust, the lifespan of different particles, and the impact of alkalinity. Our findings show that models work best when they consider reversible gas condensation with alkalinity. This should lead to better estimates of climate impacts. 
 Desert dust undergoes complex heterogeneous chemical reactions during atmospheric transport, forming nitrate coatings that influence hygroscopicity, gas partitioning, optical properties, and aerosol radiative forcing. Contemporary atmospheric chemistry models show significant disparities in aerosol nitrogen species due to varying parameterizations and inaccuracies in representing heterogeneous chemistry and dust alkalinity. This study investigates key processes in nitrate formation in the presence of dust and evaluates their representation in models. We incorporate varying levels of dust heterogeneous chemistry complexity into the Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry (MONARCH)  model, assessing sensitivity to critical processes. Our analyses address the condensation pathways of gas species onto dust (irreversible and reversible); the influence of nitrate representation on species burdens, lifetimes, and size distribution; and the role of alkalinity. Using annual global simulations, we compare particulate and gas species surface concentrations to observations and evaluate global budgets and spatial distributions. Findings show significant outcome dependence on methodology, particularly on reversible vs. irreversible gas condensation on dust, with wide ranges for particulate nitrate burdens (0.66 to 1.93 Tg) and correlations with observations (0.66 to 0.91). In contrast, particulate ammonium burdens show lower variability (0.19 to 0.31 Tg). Incorporating dust (together with sea-salt) alkalinity improves consistency with observations, with reversible condensation along with alkalinity representation yielding the best agreement, while showing consistent gas and particle partitioning. In contrast, irreversible uptake reactions overestimate coarse particulate nitrate formation. Our findings offer guidelines for integrating nitrate heterogeneous formation on dust in models, paving the road for improved estimates of aerosol radiative effects."

A new method to derive the size-resolved chemical composition of particles from ρeff is proposed. 
 The effective density (ρeff) is closely associated with the aging process and can serve as a tracer of chemical composition. Recently, studies investigating the effect of particle size on density have been limited. In this study, size-resolved ρeff was characterized using a tandem aerodynamic aerosol classifier (AAC) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) system during 1 month of observations in Hangzhou. The results indicate that the ρeff values of the particles exhibit a unimodal distribution, with average values ranging from 1.47   to 1.63 g cm−3, increasing as the particle diameter increases. The diurnal variation is more pronounced for small particles (dae < 350 nm), which generally exhibit lower density during the day and higher density at night. The relationship between ρeff and particle diameter varies under different pollution conditions due to differences in the chemical composition of the particles. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values revealed good relationships between ρeff and the bulk composition of particles with diameters smaller than 350 nm, while the relationship with larger particles was weak. As determining the size-resolved chemical composition of particles remains challenging, a new method to investigate the size-resolved chemical composition was proposed, in which the size-resolved composition can be derived from the ρeff and fixed material density of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs), organic aerosols (OAs), and black carbon (BC)."

A simulation study has been carried out to analyse the information content of the instrument combination, identify retrievable parameters, and initiate the development of a uniform retrieval algorithm for the AOD and aerosol components. The simulation study for the information content analysis is implemented using the radiative transfer model SCIATRAN and MERRA-2 reanalysis data for AOD and mass mixing ratios of different aerosol components.

 We present a 14-year, 12 km, hourly air quality dataset (https://doi.org/10.5065/cfya-4g50, Kumar and He, 2023) created by assimilating satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and carbon monoxide (CO) in an air quality model to fill gaps in the contiguous United States (CONUS) air quality monitoring network and help air quality managers understand long-term changes in county-level air quality.

We show that our dataset captures regional hourly, seasonal, and interannual variability in meteorology very well across the CONUS. The correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated surface ozone and PM2.5 concentrations for different regions defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) across the CONUS are 0.77–0.91 and 0.49–0.79, respectively.

We estimate that the annual CONUS-averaged maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) ozone and PM2.5 trends are −0.30 ppb yr−1 and −0.24 µg m−3 yr−1, respectively. Wintertime MDA8 ozone shows an increasing but statistically insignificant trend at several sites. We also found a decreasing trend in the 95th percentile of MDA8 ozone but an increasing trend in the 5th percentile. Most of the sites in the Pacific Northwest show an increasing but statistically insignificant trend during summer. An ArcGIS air quality dashboard has been developed to enable easy visualization and interpretation of county-level air quality measures and trends by stakeholders, and a Python-based Streamlit application has been developed to allow the download of the air quality data in simplified text and graphic formats."

Our study introduces HDNTL, a daily NTL dataset for 653 major cities (population >1 M by 2025) from 2012–2024, enhancing NASA's VNP46A2 accuracy by correcting spatial mismatches, angular effects, and filling small missing holes via spatiotemporal interpolation. Validated against high-resolution NTL datasets and ground-truth records, HDNTL enables precise monitoring of nighttime human activities. 
 Nighttime light (NTL) data at daily scales presents an innovative foundation for monitoring human activities, offering vast potential across various research domains such as urban planning and management, disaster monitoring, and energy consumption. The VNP46A2 dataset, sourced from NPP/VIIRS, has been providing globally corrected daily NTL data since 2012. However, persistent challenges, such as fluctuations in daily NTL series due to spatial mismatch and angular effects, as well as missing data holes, have significantly impacted the accuracy and comprehensiveness of extracting daily NTL changes. To address these challenges, a dataset production framework focusing on error correction, interpolation, and validation was developed. This framework led to the creation of a high-quality daily NTL dataset from 2012 to 2024, named HDNTL, which specifically targets 653 cities with populations predictably exceeding one million in 2025. A comparative analysis with the VNP46A2 dataset revealed promising results in spatial mismatch correction for two sample areas – the airport and flyover (angular effect can be ignored). These areas exhibited reduced fluctuations in HDNTL time series and maintained or strengthened weekly periodicity, which reflects traffic flow dynamics. Furthermore, the correction of angular effects across various urban building landscapes demonstrated sound improvements, mitigating angular effects in different directions and reducing periodicity from the angular impacts. The spatiotemporal interpolation of missing data holes has high similarity with the reference data, as indicated by an R2 of 0.98, and it increased the valid pixels of all cities by 15.12%. The HDNTL dataset exhibited enhanced consistency with high-resolution SDGSAT-1 data regarding the NTL change rate and alignment with ground truth data of power outages, showcasing superior performance in short-event detection. Overall, the HDNTL dataset effectively mitigates instability in daily series caused by spatial mismatch and angular effects observed in VNP46A2, improving data comparability across time and space dimensions. This dataset enhances the ability of the NTL to reflect the ground events, providing a more accurate reference for daily-scale nighttime light research. Additionally, the dataset production framework facilitates easy updates from future VNP46A2 products to HDNTL. The HDNTL is openly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14992989 (Pei et al., 2025)."

However, the roles of functional microbial types, OM molecular characteristics, and microbe-OM interactions in iodine mobilization remain unclear. In this study, groundwater samples with different iodine concentrations were collected from the central Yangtze River basins, China. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified sulfur disproportionation and methanogenesis as dominant metabolic processes in relatively low-I (<300 μg/L) and high-I (>300 μg/L) groundwater, respectively. Sediment incubation experiments showed that combined sulfur disproportionation and methanogenesis can promote iodine release by 87.1%. Ultrahigh-resolution molecular characterization of the organic components revealed that sulfur-disproportionating microbes may selectively metabolize bioactive OM (e.g., aliphatic compounds and oxygen-poor highly unsaturated compounds), leaving recalcitrant OM (e.g., N-containing oxygen-rich highly unsaturated compounds, polyphenols, and polycyclic aromatic compounds) in groundwater, and methanogenic microbes preferentially consume bioactive OM in low-I groundwater and recalcitrant OM in high-I groundwater. Thus, a cooperative-competitive pattern between methanogens and sulfur disproportionating microorganisms may influence OM degradation and potentially contribute to iodine mobilization. This study highlights that the OM transformation process, driven by biological sulfur disproportionation and methanogenesis, promotes iodine enrichment in alluvial-lacustrine groundwater and improves our understanding of the genesis of geogenic high-iodine groundwater systems."

The implications for food security depend not only on harvest biomass but also concentrations of nutrients and toxins in fish. Using brook trout from Adirondack lakes (New York, USA), we tested whether ongoing lake deoxygenation trends will affect fish muscle omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, and mercury concentrations. Across space (16 lakes: 1 year) and time (6 years: 1 lake), anoxia decreased selenium and was associated with elevated fish mercury, with no effect on omega-3 content. Because selenium may mitigate some end points of mercury toxicity, highly variable Se:Hg molar ratios (0.70–35.79) in neighboring lakes may have health risk implications. For fish consumers, ongoing lake deoxygenation under climate change could potentially reduce selenium intake while enhancing mercury exposure. Simultaneous alteration of beneficial compounds and toxins by environmental change complicates the development of fish consumption advisories to safeguard public health in a warming world."

However, commercial membranes inevitably reach the end-of-life (EoL) after long-term operation, which constrains the sustainability of membrane technology. Herein, we demonstrated the feasibility of upcycling real EoL poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) microfiltration (MF) membranes into reverse osmosis (RO) membranes with higher separation precision via the interfacial polymerization (IP) reaction. We highlighted that the EoL MF membrane, with a fouling-induced narrowed pore size and relatively hydrophobic properties, is preferred for upcycling. The resultant upcycled RO membrane exhibited a satisfactory NaCl rejection (98.6 ± 0.4%) with favorable water permeance (2.3 ± 0.7 L m–2 h–1 bar–1), comparable to the performance of commercial RO membranes. Real wastewater treatment evaluations confirmed the membrane stability and permeate safety. Life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis showed that this upcycling process promises environmental and economic benefits, potentially reducing CO2-eq emissions by 18.6% and costs by 76.5%–92.2% compared with the conventional membrane approach.

Phytoremediation, in which metals in contaminated soil are accumulated by plants for remediation, is energy- and cost-intensive, as the recovered plants are typically burned with the aim of concentrating the metals. In this study, we propose a Li recovery method that entails harvesting the salts excreted by Li-tolerant halophytes. Acids exuded from the roots of halophytic Rhodes grass can leach Li+ ions from soil-borne Li ore, thereby facilitating Li absorption via the roots and subsequent excretion through leaf salt glands. Li concentrations in the salts excreted by Rhodes grass grown in soil containing Li ore (amblygonite) at 200 mg Li kg–1 were 110-fold higher than those in the soil. Efficient recovery of Li from Li-containing soil as excreted salts thus reduces soil contamination and ultimately contributes to a sustainable Li cycle with low environmental impact."

Similarly to the water–air transfer process, such as sea spray, aerosols generated during the wastewater treatment process, driven by aeration and mechanical agitation, are an overlooked potential source of airborne microplastics. This study constitutes the first attempt to investigate the pollution characteristics of microplastics in aerosols generated during wastewater treatment, based on laser direct infrared spectroscopy (LDIR) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Microplastics were ubiquitously observed in aerosols from each unit of the wastewater treatment plant, with abundances in the range of 0.83–28.03 items·m–3. A total of 30 different polymer types were identified by LDIR, while polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate were the most common polymers. Film and fragment were the main shapes, with a predominant size range of 20–50 μm. The aerosolization degree of microplastics is affected by the aeration intensities and hydrodynamic conditions maintained in each unit, but also varied depending on their inherent characteristics. These findings suggest that the aerosolization of microplastics from wastewater treatment is a potential source of airborne microplastics.

Aerobic methanotrophs, which serve as biological methane sinks, play a key role in methane cycling, but their responses to Cd stress remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the relationship between Cd pollution levels and aerobic methane oxidation potential in paddy soils. We evaluated methanotrophic enrichments under Cd exposure, applied metagenomic sequencing to identify functional microbes, and investigated Cd tolerance mechanisms in pure culture. Aerobic methane oxidation rates were positively correlated with Cd levels in paddy soils from South China, with Methylocystis and Methylomonas emerging as dominant genera possessing diverse Cd tolerance genes. Notably, interspecific differences in Cd tolerance were observed among methanotrophic strains. The faster-growing Methylomonas sp., endowed with more robust antioxidant defenses and extracellular polymeric substances synthesis genes, exhibited Cd resistance through markedly enhanced loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances production, in contrast to the Cd-sensitive Methylobacter sp. Gene knockout experiments confirmed the essential roles of glutathione synthase, glutathione peroxidase, and exosortase in exopolysaccharide extrusion for Cd detoxification.

Carbon sources and eutrophication trends were observed for lakes from the 1990s to 2020s, with further deterioration expected over the next 80 years. Unmanaged land use change in lake watersheds could exacerbate the CO2 flux into lakes and water quality degradation.

The WLUP framework identifies Asia and Europe as the regions experiencing the greatest demands for land use transformation, where optimization leads to the most significant improvements. Metagenomic analysis revealed that forests enhance carbon fixation and that grasslands reduce carbon degradation and phosphorus metabolism in lake watersheds, explaining and supporting the possibility of WLUP.

By measuring the particle-resolved mixing state of BCc in the residues of orographic clouds downstream of a ground-based counter-flow virtual impactor, we found that a fraction of 30–90% of BCc could be in clouds by a collision/coalescence process without satisfying the conventional Köhler theory for CCN activation. These non-CCN BCc in clouds occupied a larger fraction of total in-cloud BCc when cloud droplets were larger, e.g., the non-CCN BCc fraction in clouds increased from 40% to 80% when the effective diameter of droplets increased from about 7.6 to 15.8 μm. This collision/coalescence process among droplets and BCc tended to be more efficient for larger droplets, which is also supported by microscopy images that one droplet could capture more than one BC cores. Larger droplets corresponded to lower ambient water supersaturation, under which conditions the removal of BCc in clouds by collision/coalescence may override CCN activation. By in situ measurements, the results here for the first time separated and quantified the BCc in clouds between activation and nonactivation processes, which provides insights into evaluating the wet removal and aging of atmospheric BC."

While the impact of BC in snow (BCS) on snowmelt is widely recognized, its competitive effect relative to climate warming has been less studied, a critical knowledge gap given Northeast China’s heavy reliance on snowmelt for agricultural and residential water use. This study, utilizing comprehensive field measurements across Northeast China, reveals alarmingly high BCS concentrations with a mean of 1100 ± 810 ng g–1, 17 times greater than the global average. These high BCS levels contribute to 72% (0.82 cm d–1) of accelerated snowmelt rates (ASR), surpassing the effects of climate warming (28%, 0.32 cm d–1). Importantly, the observation-constrained CMIP6 projections under the SSP245 scenario indicate an 82% reduction in BCS by 2080–2100. This decline could offset 40% of the projected ASR increase by future warming, slowing the total ASR of 2080–2100 to 71% above that of 2000–2020.

This study demonstrated that cadmium ion (Cd(II)) mediation accelerated the photoaging of polystyrene NPs (carboxyl-modified CNPs, amino-modified ANPs, sulfonate, and amino comodified SANPs) by generating more •OH and 1O2, thereby altering their physicochemical properties and consequent transport behavior. Kinetic attachment models and Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory proved that the Cd(II)-mediated photoaging process had diverse effects on the transport and retention of surface-functionalized NPs in water-saturated sand media. In particular, Cd(II) mediation at 50 mg/L increased the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on aged CNPs, facilitating their transport by 20.3% with reduced k2 (0.036 vs 0.021) and increased φmax (74.804 KBT vs 85.127 KBT) values. Conversely, enhanced aged ANP agglomerates driven by amino-carboxyl electrostatic attraction had ripening adsorption on additional heterogeneous surfaces of sand. The presence of reinforced fragments of aged ANPs deposited on sand led to remarkable detachment. Aged SANPs retained their original mobility after Cd(II) mediation due to negligible changes in surface groups, whereas their retention associated with a higher k1d (0.347 vs 0.183) became more reversible to be flushed out by water.

Because prolonged use of pharmaceutical glucocorticoids in humans has been linked to osteoporosis and impaired bone growth, we hypothesized that the ability of teleost fish to regenerate fins following damage may be inhibited by exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids in the environment. In the present study, we examined fin regeneration following a 7 days waterborne exposure of juvenile fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to the synthetic glucocorticoids, fluticasone propionate and dexamethasone. Expression of several biologically relevant gene products (sgk1, tdgf1, runx2a, lef1, shha, and tsc22d3) was measured in paired caudal fin and whole-body tissues. Fluticasone propionate and dexamethasone significantly impaired fin regeneration at measured water concentrations of 2.62 μg/L and 4.62 mg/L, respectively. Changes in gene expression indicated disruption of intercellular communication in the Wnt/β-catenin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways after exposure to 4.86 μg/L fluticasone propionate. Upregulation of tsc22d3, a transcription factor responsible for suppression of anti-inflammatory response, may be the plausible cause of repressed cellular signaling.

However, the prevalence of these chemicals in PCPs used by the public, particularly by Black women and Latinas, remains poorly documented. We examined the prevalence of formaldehyde and FRPs listed as ingredients on PCPs from the Taking Stock Study (TSS), a community-engaged study in which 70 Black women and Latinas in South Los Angeles logged their PCP use with a smartphone application. We contextualized our results using EPA’s Chemical and Products Database (CPDat), a public ingredient database. More than half of the TSS participants (53%) reported using at least one PCP with formaldehyde or FRPs despite only 4% of TSS PCPs and 8% of CPDat PCPs listing formaldehyde and/or FRPs as ingredients. We found formaldehyde and FRPs listed in frequently used products such as lotions and cleansers. The most common FRP was 1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMDM) hydantoin.

This study explores these processes within semi‐confined aquifers using laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The results reveal, for the first time, that contaminants from semi‐confined aquifers mix within the interiors of overlying saltwater wedges in unconfined aquifers. As aquitard permeability decreases, contaminant composition mixed within overlying wedges changes from saltwater‐density to freshwater‐density counterparts. Two primary retention mechanisms are identified for deep‐layer contaminants: One involves entrapment within aquitards, facilitating the mixing of contaminants into overlying wedges; the other arises from gravity‐induced mixing between saltwater‐density plumes and saltwater wedges. Interestingly, the residence times of freshwater‐density and saltwater‐density contaminants increase initially and then decline with reduced aquitard permeability. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex processes involved in deep‐layer contaminant transport and retention in coastal aquifers."

Results reveal that the modified autoconversion parameterization better simulates the active‐break spells of the ISM rainfall. The main improvements include the contrasting features of rainfall over land and ocean and the MISO index, representing MISO periodicity. The improvements are qualitatively and quantitatively more significant in the higher‐resolution simulations, particularly regarding rainfall spatial patterns over the Indian subcontinent during active spells. The MISO monitoring index in the revised CFSv2 also shows improvement compared with the control run.

To support accurate investigations into environmental and climatic impacts of dust from these deserts, we analyzed over sixty thousand individual dust particles, generated by sandblasting from their primary surface types: Gobi soils and sand dunes. TGD particles were generally smaller, rounder, and smoother than UBD's. The Gobi soil and sand dune particles of the TGD exhibited the largest number fractions at 0.5 μm and 0.5–0.6 μm in size and those of the UBD at 0.7 and 0.6 μm, respectively. Aspect ratios were similar across particles, around 1.3 roundness varied, with TGD particles averaging 0.55 (Gobi soils) and 0.50 (sand dunes) compared to UBD particles at 0.40–0.45 (Gobi soils) and 0.45 (sand dunes). Mineral analysis revealed both deserts produced particles rich in clay minerals, quartz, and other silicate particles. TGD particles contained more kaolinite and quartz, whereas UBD particles had higher chlorite and other silicates. Gypsum and halite were identified in 3.13% and 3.63% of UBD Gobi particles, respectively, indicating salt abundance in some particles; but these two salts were rarely detected in TGD particles.

Here, we compare these novel Asian UTLS measurements with long‐term satellite observations and regional measurements to broaden understanding of OCS trends and its transport by the ASM. Trajectory analysis identifies northern China as the main source region for deep convective lofting of OCS‐enriched parcels and demonstrates ASM entrainment in the UTLS, allowing evaluation of global model predictions for OCS's stratospheric influence.

Previous studies have proposed using outputs from sea‐ice growth model to estimate microwave emissivities and emission temperatures for DA. However, this approach poses practical challenges, as it operates independently of numerical weather prediction systems. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an artificial neural network (ANN) technique that transforms the modeling approach into an algorithm capable of directly retrieving radiative boundary conditions from satellite observations. The ANN leverages empirical knowledge that sea‐ice emissivity is closely related to ice type and that microwave penetration depth varies with frequency, capturing temperature profiles within sea ice. It targets winter Arctic Ocean, using brightness temperatures (TBs) from ATMS channels 1 to 3 (23, 36, and 51 GHz) as inputs to retrieve emissivity and emission temperature for surface‐sensitive channels 6 and 7 (53 and 54 GHz). The ANN algorithm was trained and validated using simulated data sets, demonstrating high accuracy with correlation coefficients of 0.99 and low errors. Further evaluation using ATMS observations from the winters of 2021 and 2022 was conducted by converting the retrievals into top‐of‐atmosphere TBs, yielding consistent error statistics: correlation coefficients of 0.99, mean deviations of about −0.3 K, and standard deviations of about 0.3 K for both channels. These results confirm the algorithm's stability and robust generalization capabilities, underscoring its potential for integration within DA systems and broader applications to other microwave sensors."

This study unravels the characteristics, variations, and driving factors of compound extreme temperature‐extreme dust events in the Gobi Desert (GD) during the springs of 2000–2023. The temperature in the GD is high before extreme dust events (EDEs), while that is low during EDEs. Correspondingly, extreme hot events (EHEs) occur prior to EDEs and extreme cold events (ECEs) occur during EDEs. The frequency of EHEs associated with EDEs in 2012–2023 is 100% higher than that in 2000–2011, while the frequency of ECEs associated with EDEs in 2012–2023 is 75% lower than that in 2000–2011. Accordingly, compound extreme events associated with EDEs shift from EDE‐ECEs to EHE‐EDEs. By strengthening East Asian anomalous high pressure, enhanced Arctic Oscillation during the pre‐EDE periods and weakened Eurasian teleconnection during EDEs increases EHEs and decreases ECEs, respectively, and combined drive the shift in the compound extreme events. This study reveals a new feature of compound extreme weather events in the context of climate change, which manifests as the shift from EDE‐ECEs to EHE‐EDEs in the GD. The occurrence of more EHE‐EDEs will put already fragile ecosystems of the GD at even greater risk. Therefore, the containment of global warming, especially in arid and semiarid regions, is necessary and urgent."

The role of mixed Rossby‐Gravity (MRG) waves in modulating the east Pacific Hadley circulation (EPHC) strength is explored during boreal summer season using ERA5 reanalysis data. Composite analysis of MRG activity for five strong and five weak EPHC seasons identified based on a mass stream function based metric reveal that strong EPHC seasons are associated with pronounced MRG activity, whereas the MRG activity is weak during weak EPHC seasons. Although the sea surface temperature (SST) background state over EP is not favorable for thermally driven deep convection, low‐level convergence induced by synoptic scale disturbances such as the MRG waves can trigger deep convection over the region, and in turn influence the EPHC strength. The question of whether boundary forced convergence can have an impact on the EPHC strength is further investigated using an atmospheric mixed layer model. Surface convergence driven by meridional SST gradients are not found to be significantly different during strong and weak EPHC seasons, implying the dominant role of MRG in modulating the strength of EPHC. The study also reveals a new possible mechanism via which the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the strength of EPHC—ENSO induced changes in the mean background state modulates the spatio‐temporal characteristics of MRG waves which in turn affect the low‐level convergence over the region and impacts the strength of EPHC."

The present study offers an insight into the consistency of convective rain observations from spaceborne active (KuPR)/passive (GPM Microwave Imager [GMI]) microwave sensors and ground‐based radar network (GV‐MRMS). Findings over CONUS suggest a strong agreement in convective rain detection between the three products for the deep convective regime—the storms exceeding 10 km in height and characterized by low brightness temperature at ice‐sensing channels. In contrast, a poor agreement occurs for shallow‐broken rain systems with storm tops below 5 km. Compared to the GV‐MRMS product, GMI and KuPR tend to classify shallow‐broken rain as convective. Globally, at the midlatitudes, GMI recognizes less than 20% of KuPR‐detected convective rain, while showing a better agreement in the tropical regions. Linear trends of GMI and KuPR convective rain, calculated for the period 2014–2023, reveal agreement in cold (ice phase present in the hydrometer column) and disagreement in warm (no ice phase present) rain cases, with −0.022 (GMI) and −0.019 (KuPR) mm day−1 decade−1 for cold and −0.010 (KuPR) and 0.002 (GMI) mm day−1 decade−1 for warm rain, respectively.

We analyze the health impacts across Western and Central Europe from exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ${\text{PM}}_{2.5}$) and surface level ozone (O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$) in 2014 and in 2050 using three scenarios with different levels of climate change mitigation, using a high‐resolution atmospheric chemistry model to simulate future air quality. We use recent health functions to estimate mortality related to the aforementioned pollutants. We also analyze the relationship between air quality mortality rate per 100,000 people and Human Development Index to establish if reductions in air quality mortality are achieved equitably. We find that air quality‐related mortality (PM2.5 ${\text{PM}}_{2.5}$ + O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ mortality) will only reduce in the future following a high‐mitigation scenario (54%). It could increase by 7.5% following a medium‐mitigation scenario and by 8.3% following a weak mitigation scenario. The differences are driven by larger reductions in PM2.5 ${\text{PM}}_{2.5}$‐related mortality and a small reduction in O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$‐related mortality following the high‐mitigation scenario, whereas for the other scenarios, smaller improvements in PM2.5 ${\text{PM}}_{2.5}$‐related mortality are masked by worsening O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$‐related mortality.

 Soils can be either a source or sink of atmospheric CO2 depending on how soil organic carbon (SOC) responds to climate warming and changes in plant productivity. Whereas warming typically accelerates SOC decomposition, the effect of plant productivity changes remains unclear. Here we use a space-for-change substitution approach to analyse a global dataset of SOC measurements down to 1 metre. We find that warming-induced SOC reduction in the 0–0.3-m topsoil is gradually offset by increasing plant productivity but exacerbated in the 0.3–1-m subsoil until plant productivity increase crosses a threshold of 30%. Consequently, entirely offsetting warming-induced SOC reduction in the top metre of soil requires an unrealistically high increase in plant productivity, albeit with substantial variance across ecosystems. Soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is the dominant predictor of the variance in SOC response, as this ratio determines whether nitrogen released during carbon loss meets the requirement for additional plant growth or whether additional nitrogen must be mined from soil organic matter. Such mining accelerates SOC losses, particularly in the subsoil, where the soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is lower than in topsoils. We conclude that globally, increased plant productivity may exacerbate SOC losses under climate warming, particularly in the subsoil. Soils may release more CO2 under warming when increases in plant productivity mine nitrogen from soil organic matter, according to an analysis of a global dataset of soil organic carbon measurements."

Here, the authors suggest that adaptations endotherms needed to return to marine life are associated with longer reproductive lifespans and delayed development, favouring a slow-paced life strategy. 
 All organisms face a certain risk of dying before reproducing, putting strong pressure on individuals to reproduce as early as possible. Despite this, some organisms delay maturity, defer reproduction, and age slowly. The evolution of such slow-paced life is classically attributed to allometric effects and reduced extrinsic mortality, but might also result from the invasion of challenging environments requiring adaptations that boost adult survival yet impose substantial energetic and developmental costs. Here, we reveal that the invasion of marine environments by endotherms may have triggered adaptive shifts towards slow life histories, particularly in pelagic lineages. Such life history convergences may have been facilitated by the slow-paced nature of their non-marine ancestors, and were associated with adaptations for enhanced energy acquisition and storage, enabling a long reproductive lifespan at the expense of extended development. Ancestral traits and lifestyle changes might thus have been important in shaping the evolution of slow life histories. The evolution of a slow life history may be due to reduced extrinsic mortality and allometric effects.

 Lipid degradation is generally considered an antagonistic pathway to lipid synthesis, so this pathway is often removed to improve lipid production. In this study, triacylglycerol (TAG) cycling formed by lipid degradation is found to be crucial for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthesis; this result contradicts the notion that lipid degradation is a useless process. Specifically, we demonstrate that TAG cycling promoting PUFA biosynthesis occurred in Yarrowia lipolytica and Mortierella alpina via the desaturase/elongase pathway but not in Schizochytrium sp. with the polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway. Exploiting the TAG cycling mechanism, a strategy of decoupling the TAG biosynthesis and degradation is developed. Using this strategy, the titers of C20:5, C22:5 and prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) in Y. lipolytica are improved by 116.2%, 99.4% and 41.7%, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of the TAG cycling for related biochemical synthesis in the construction of excellent oleaginous engineered strains.

 Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is a standard therapy for treating bone defects, with collagen-based barrier membranes widely used clinically. However, these membranes face challenges like poor mechanical properties, early bacterial invasion and immunomodulation deficiency, potentially risking GBR failure. Orchestrating macrophage activation and controlling their M1 or M2 polarization are effective strategies for bone repair. Here, we present a Janus collagen-based barrier membrane with immunomodulation. The porous layer promotes direct osteogenic differentiation and inward growth of osteoblasts. The dense layer prevents invasion of soft tissue into bone defects and protects bone defects from bacterial infection. The membrane also enhances rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell infiltration, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation by regulating the immune microenvironment, demonstrating superior bone regeneration compared to the commercial Bio-Gide® membrane. Overall, the Janus collagen-based membrane reduces tissue inflammation and fosters an osteoimmune environment conducive to new bone formation, offering effective material design for advanced GBR technology.

The authors here unveil the selective stepwise transition, achieve ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films. 
 Antiferroelectrics exhibit reversible antipolar-polar phase transitions under electric fields, yielding large electrostrain suitable for electromechanical devices. Nevertheless, in thin-film form, the antiferroelectric behavior is often obscured by competing ferroic orders, resulting in slanted hysteresis loops with undesired remnant polarization, subsequently posing challenges in obtaining ideal antiferroelectricity and understanding their intrinsic electrical behavior. Here, atomistic models for controllable antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition pathways are unveiled along specific crystallographic directions. Guided by the anisotropic phase transition and orientation design, we achieved ideal antiferroelectricity with square double hysteresis loop, large saturated polarization (~60 μC/cm2), near-zero remnant polarization, fast response time (~75 ns), and near-fatigue-free performance (~1010 cycles) in (111)P-oriented PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films. Moreover, a bipolar and frequency-independent digital electrostrain (~0.83%) was demonstrated in this architype antiferroelectric system. In-situ X-ray diffraction studies further reveal that the large digital electrostrain results from an intrinsic field-induced antiferroelectric-ferroelectric structural transition. This work demonstrates the anisotropic phase transition mechanism and ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in antiferroelectric thin films, offering a new avenue for applications of antiferroelectricity in nanoelectromechanical systems.

 K+ homeostasis is crucial for bacterial survival. The bacterial K+ channel KtrAB is regulated by the binding of ADP and ATP to the cytosolic RCK subunits KtrA. While the ligand-induced conformational changes in KtrA are well described, the transmission to the gating regions within KtrB is not understood. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of the ADP-bound, inactive KtrAB complex from Vibrio alginolyticus, which resolves part of KtrB’s N termini. They are short intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) located at the interface of KtrA and KtrB. We reveal that these IDRs play a decisive role in ATP-mediated channel opening, while the closed ADP-bound state does not depend on the N-termini. We propose an allosteric mechanism, in which ATP-induced conformational changes within KtrA trigger an interaction of KtrB’s N-terminal IDRs with the membrane, stabilizing the active and conductive state of KtrAB.

 Directed evolution is a process of mutation and artificial selection to breed biomolecules with new or improved activity.

This platform is stable and can generate sufficient diversity for directed evolution in mammalian systems. Using PROTEUS, we alter the doxycycline responsiveness of tetracycline-controlled transactivators, generating a more sensitive TetON-4G tool for gene regulation with mammalian-specific adaptations.

Here the authors show that the posterior parietal cortex can represent these associations and generate mismatch responses to deviations in these sequences. 
 An important function of the neocortex is to compare sensory feedback stimuli with internal predictions of the outside world and evoke mismatch responses to deviations, thus allowing expectations to be updated. The mechanisms behind sensory feedback mismatch and prediction formation however remain unclear. Here we created a learned association of an auditory-tactile stimulus sequence in awake head-fixed mice, where a sound predicted an up-coming whisker stimulus and introduced mismatches by omitting or altering the whisker stimulus intensity. We showed that layer 2/3 posterior parietal cortex (PPC) neurons could report stimulus sequence mismatches, as well as display neural correlates of expectation. Inhibition of PPC-projecting secondary motor cortex (M2) neurons suppressed these correlates, along with population mismatch responses. Hence, M2 can influence sensory processing in the PPC and potentially contribute to the prediction of sensory feedback from learned relationships within sequences of sensory stimuli. How learned associations of sensory sequences can influence subsequent processing remains unclear.

 Despite remarkable progress in designing RNA delivery systems, endosomal escape remains a recognized challenge for efficient RNA delivery. In this study, we develop a robust mRNA delivery platform termed endosomolytic chloroquine-like optimized lipid nanoparticles (ecoLNPs) for versatile mRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo via integrating the signature scaffold extracted from endosomolytic chloroquine into ionizable lipids. RNase-resistant ecoLNPs are capable of delivering a broad variety of mRNA payloads to diverse cell types, even hard-to-transfect 3D cells, with an efficiency of up to 18.9-fold higher than that of commercial transfection reagents. The pH-responsive endosomolytic activity of ecoLNPs can be largely attributed to the proton sponge effect and saposin B-promoted membrane disruption. In vivo, ecoLNPs enable potent local and systemic mRNA delivery and exhibit comparable potency to the clinically approved mRNA vaccine carrier, but strong tropism for lymph nodes following intramuscular injection. Furthermore, ecoLNPs are able to retain in vivo delivery potency for at least one week under non-frozen conditions and induce efficient genome editing in transgenic mice.

 Climate injustice persists as those least responsible often bear the greatest impacts, both between and within countries. Here we show how GHG emissions from consumption and investments attributable to the wealthiest population groups have disproportionately influenced present-day climate change. We link emissions inequality over the period 1990–2020 to regional climate extremes using an emulator-based framework. We find that two-thirds (one-fifth) of warming is attributable to the wealthiest 10% (1%), meaning that individual contributions are 6.5 (20) times the average per capita contribution. For extreme events, the top 10% (1%) contributed 7 (26) times the average to increases in monthly 1-in-100-year heat extremes globally and 6 (17) times more to Amazon droughts. Emissions from the wealthiest 10% in the United States and China led to a two- to threefold increase in heat extremes across vulnerable regions. Quantifying the link between wealth disparities and climate impacts can assist in the discourse on climate equity and justice.

Here the authors show a strategy to amplify the resistance to crack growth in natural rubber by forming a tanglemer. 
 Natural rubber, with annual production of 15 million tonnes, is the most used bio-elastomer. Improving its resistance to crack growth is highly desired, to prolong its service life for many applications and eventually improve its sustainability. Here we markedly amplify the resistance to crack growth in natural rubber by forming a tanglemer, a polymer network in which entanglements greatly outnumber crosslinks. Specifically, we cast natural rubber latex without high-intensity processing that cuts long polymers. The long polymers densely entangle by thermal motion and are then sparsely crosslinked. At a crack tip, long polymer strands between neighbouring crosslinks deconcentrate stress, extend strain-induced crystallization over a large region and enhance crystallinity. For example, when the ratio of crosslinks to repeat units reduces from 10−2 to 10−3, the network amplifies fatigue threshold from ~50 J m−2 to ~200 J m−2, and toughness from ~104 J m−2 to over 105 J m−2. Overall, this work provides a viable strategy to improve the practical applicability of natural rubber, contributing to the development of sustainable polymers.

 From 2021 to 2023, satellite records reveal that February Antarctic sea ice extent reached record lows in 2022 and 2023. Simultaneously, the Antarctic ice sheet experienced a transient mass gain and rebounded temporarily from a decadal decline since 2002. The reasons behind these dramatic changes are unknown. Here, we show that the triple-dip La Niña event during 2021–2023 (referred to as TD_LN2023) played a major role in these changes. Compared to a previous triple-dip La Niña event (1999–2001), the tropical-Antarctic teleconnections during TD_LN2023 were stronger. A more pronounced southward shift of the Ferrel Cell was identified as a key driver for the enhanced tropical-Antarctic teleconnections during TD_LN2023 against the background of intensified westerly winds and tropical expansion. The poleward increase, which facilitated poleward atmospheric heat and moisture transport, contributed to the sea ice extent decline and the ice sheet mass growth. Additionally, this southward shift strengthened the Rossby wave train, which, sustained by enhanced stratosphere-troposphere coupling, amplified the Pacific-South American pattern, and further promoted regional sea ice decline. Finally, this southward shift, associated with the southward shift of the westerly jet, enhanced Ekman suction, bringing subsurface warm water to the surface and contributing to pan-Antarctic low sea ice. The physical processes outlined in the case study are further validated through empirical orthogonal function and regression analysis. Under global warming, multi-year La Niña events are projected to occur more frequently. The evolving tropical-Antarctic teleconnections in the context warrant close attention."

 The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the principal mode of atmospheric variability over the North Atlantic, modulating the weather and climate of neighboring regions in both winter and summer. While Earth System Models generally project a more positive NAO under 21st century high-emission scenarios, uncertainties persist as to the precise response of the NAO to increased CO2 levels, owing to large internal variability. In this study we investigate the response of the NAO to a wide range of CO2 forcings, from two to eight times the preindustrial values. Analyzing a large sample of present-generation climate models, we find that the NAO likely becomes more positive with increasing CO2 concentrations. Moreover, we find a reduction in NAO variability. This leads to a smaller increase in the likelihood of extremely positive NAO events than would be expected based solely on the shift in the mean. On the other hand, we also find a reduction in extremely negative NAO events, which is attributable to both the shift toward more positive values and the decrease in variance. Finally, our analysis reveals that the distribution of the NAO response at high CO2 forcing is negatively skewed. This fact partially offsets the decrease in extremely positive NAO events associated with reduced variability. Ultimately, our results suggest a greater increase in positive NAO events compared to the decrease in extremely negative NAO events at higher CO2 forcing."

 The rapid decline of Arctic sea ice resulting from anthropogenic climate change poses significant risks to indigenous communities, ecosystems, and the global climate system. This situation emphasizes the immediate necessity for precise seasonal sea ice forecasts. While dynamical models perform well for short-term forecasts, they encounter limitations in long-term forecasts and are computationally intensive. Deep learning models, while more computationally efficient, often have difficulty managing seasonal variations and uncertainties when dealing with complex sea ice dynamics. In this research, we introduce IceMamba, a deep learning architecture that integrates sophisticated attention mechanisms within the state space model. Through comparative analysis of 25 renowned forecast models, including dynamical, statistical, and deep learning approaches, our experimental results indicate that IceMamba delivers excellent seasonal forecasting capabilities for Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration.

 Accurate estimations of global land surface energy balance components [including net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), soil heat flux (G) and sensible heat flux (H)] are crucial for quantifying the exchange of heat and water between the land surface and atmosphere. In this study, a novel and practical model for Coordinated estimates of 4-day 500 m global land Surface Energy Balance components (CoSEB) was developed, using the multivariate random forest technique and a synthesis of remote sensing and reanalysis datasets, as well as the extensive observations at 336 eddy-covariance sites worldwide. The CoSEB model effectively balances the estimates of Rn, LE, H, and G by learning the physics of energy conservation embedded in these components within the training datasets. Its advantages include 1) the accurate estimation of the four energy components and their ratios [i.e. evaporation fraction, defined as LE/Rn−G, which reflects the proportion of surface available energy that is allocated to LE instead of H], and 2) the ability to maintain energy balance among the four energy components, i.e. Rn−G−LE−H=0. With the 10-fold cross-validation at 286 sites, the CoSEB model achieved the root mean square error (RMSE) of 16.42 W/m2, 16.40 W/m2, 16.49 W/m2, 4.79 W/m2 and 0.22, and the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.92, 0.86, 0.83, 0.55 and 0.59, respectively, for estimating Rn, LE, H, G and evaporative fraction, which were comparable or superior to those estimated by other typical data-driven uncoordinated and coordinated models. In the validation with test datasets at another 50 eddy-covariance sites, the CoSEB model, with the RMSE of 18.23 W/m2, 17.98 W/m2, and 19.17 W/m2, and the R2 of 0.87, 0.72, 0.71 in estimating Rn, LE, and H, respectively, outperformed all six state-of-the-art algorithms/products, i.e. FLUXCOM, BESSV2.0, MOD16A2, PML_V2, ETMonitor and GLASS. Besides, the CoSEB model successfully maintained energy balance, exhibiting an energy imbalance ratio [EIR, defined as 100%×Rn−G−LE−H/Rn] of 0, in comparison to other coordinated and uncoordinated models/products presenting the EIRs of as high as 50%. The new model also produced consistent global patterns with the six state-of-the-art products for each of the Rn, LE, and H estimates at 8-day, monthly, and yearly scales. The CoSEB model is promising for operationally generating high-accuracy global balanced land surface energy components and their ratios, which is essential for rationally partitioning surface available energy into H and LE, and for revealing the spatiotemporal variations of the energy components and their attributions and mechanisms at regional and global scales."

 A top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance model based on the temporal characteristics of stable land surface targets, such as pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICSs), was developed to monitor the stability of satellite visible imagers without requiring ground measurements. This model accounts for variations in the viewing zenith angle, solar zenith angle, and atmospheric parameters. To better represent multiple scattering contributions between the surface and atmosphere, we introduced the scattering angle and applied a sinusoidal function with a 365-day period to model seasonal atmospheric variations. Notably, the model does not rely on long-term temporal stability of PICSs, as it primarily characterizes angular and atmospheric variations rather than site-inherent stability. A comprehensive uncertainty analysis, based on a metrology-driven approach, indicates that the model achieves an average uncertainty of better than 4 %. Furthermore, the modeled TOA reflectance maintains long-term radiometric consistency with observations from the Sentinel-2 A/B MSI and Landsat-8/OLI sensors. Across 177 matching observations, the relative difference between observed and modeled values is mostly within 3 %, demonstrating the model's effectiveness. The proposed model is further applied to calibrate the GF6/WFI sensor, with cross-validation conducted using Sentinel-2/MSI and Terra/MODIS observed TOA reflectance as references, while constraining imaging time and viewing geometry. The TOA reflectance calibrated using the proposed model shows improved consistency with the reference TOA reflectance compared to that obtained using official calibration coefficients."

 Tunnel mapping systems are essential for tunnel inspection, integrating sensors like LiDAR, cameras, and odometers to enhance data accuracy. However, calibration is challenging due to mechanical constraints and repetitive sensor installations, especially for LiDAR-Camera alignment. Existing methods struggle in tunnels with poor lighting and low texture, and they fail to address irregular vibrations from the flashing light system, causing instability. We propose a robust online calibration technique for LiDAR-Camera extrinsic parameters. By establishing a reversible mapping through surface parameterization, our approach ensures accurate cross-modality alignment. Additionally, we use depth constraints to stabilize adjacent camera stations, which are typically short-edge connections and prone to instability in photogrammetric bundle adjustment. This effectively mitigates irregular vibration effects. Validation in real-world tunnels confirms persistent vibration issues despite mechanical reinforcement. Our algorithm achieves precise point cloud and image alignment, reducing back-projection errors by over 50% and significantly improving data fusion accuracy in challenging conditions."

 Reliable tropical cyclone (TC) modeling and forecasting requires appropriate selection of physical parameterization schemes. This study focusses on the poleward-moving TCs in the northern East China Sea. Numerical experiments are carried out to examine the sensitivity of modeled TC parameters to different combinations of microphysics (MP), planetary boundary layer (PBL), and cumulus convection (CC) schemes. Model performance is evaluated against observations from China Meteorological Administration best-track dataset, satellite retrieved wind fields, and land-based meteorological stations. A composite evaluation metric is introduced to enable cross-variable model assessment and quantify the relative performance of each scheme combination. Results indicate that while MP schemes have a moderate impact on TC's minimum sea level pressure and maximum wind speed, they evidently influence surface wind field reproduction. Model performance across the PBL schemes is generally comparable, except for the University of Washington boundary layer scheme, which demonstrates strong forecasting skill for maximum wind speed but introduces substantial discrepancies in TC track, minimum sea level pressure, and surface wind fields. Moreover, model performance is highly sensitive to the choice of CC scheme. The Tiedtke scheme consistently yields the highest performance score across all datasets, particularly effective in reducing wind field discrepancies. This study underscores the necessity of considering multiple TC parameters and addressing spatial discrepancies in model calibration and performance evaluation. The findings provide insights into optimizing physical scheme combinations for TC modeling in the northern East China Sea, with broader implications for improving extreme weather forecasting. However, their applicability to other regions and TC types remains uncertain. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the physical mechanisms driving scheme-related differences in model performance."

Specifically, 1) the positive phase of the IOBM favours anomalous diabatic cooling extending from northern India to the northeastern maritime continents, which induces anomalous anticyclonic circulation there and a negative phase of East Asia-Pacific teleconnection, resulting in more EWS in the west Sichuan Plateau; 2) the atmospheric heating anomaly over the maritime continents in the El Niño decaying summertime shows an anomalous diabatic cooling in the northeastern part and anomalous diabatic warming in the southwestern part, which corresponds to a more robust and westward extending western Pacific subtropical high and favours the occurrence of EWS in the Sichuan Basin; 3) to the interannual variation of EWS in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, it is closely related to the anomalous cyclonic circulation covering South China, which is significantly associated with the anomalous diabatic cooling over the Arabian Sea-Bay of Bengal region.

 The CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) yield a generally large bias in air temperature simulation over China, necessitating corrections before we can rely on their future projections. In this study, we performed air temperature corrections of 26 CMIP6 GCMs using two methods—bias correction method (BC-correction) and quantile mapping (QM-correction), with the CN05.1 observational data serving as the benchmark. We conducted a comparative assessment of the simulation performance of the CMIP6 GCMs and their multi-model ensemble means (MMEs) before and after corrections, considering both temporal and spatial scales across historical and future periods under multiple shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios. The results show that the BC-correction method substantially rectifies the systematic underestimation of annual mean air temperature in CMIP6 GCMs across China, demonstrating superior performance compared to the QM approach, but with varying correction effects observed across different seasons. The MMEs show efficacy in capturing temporal-spatial variation patterns of air temperature recorded by the CN05.1 observation, however, certain discrepancies persist in specific trend magnitudes and locations. Moreover, compared to the original MME, the BC-corrected MME reveals projected enhanced future warming amplitudes across various timeframes and SSPs relative to the baseline period (1995–2014).

Current treatments, such as hearing aids and implants, aim to mitigate these effects but often fall short in addressing the critical issue of accurately pinpointing sound sources. We report an intelligent hearing system inspired by the human auditory system: asymmetric well-aligned piezoelectric nanofibers combined with neural networks to mimic natural auditory processes. Piezoelectric nanofibers with spirally varying lengths and directions transmit and convert acoustic sound into mechanoelectrical signals, mimicking the complex cochlear dynamics. These signals are then encoded by digital neural networks, enabling accurate sound direction recognition. This intelligent hearing system surpasses human directional hearing, accurately recognizing sound directions horizontally and vertically. The advancement represents a substantial stride toward next-generation artificial hearing, harmonizing transduction and perception with a nature-inspired design. It promises for applications in hearing aids, wearable devices, and implants, offering enhanced auditory experiences for those with hearing impairments."

The cell is the basic unit of biological systems, and yet the study of cell-type allometry remains relatively unexplored. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a promising tool for investigating cell-type allometry. Planarians, capable of growing and degrowing following allometric scaling rules, serve as an excellent model for these studies. We used scRNA-seq to examine cell-type allometry in asexual planarians of different sizes, revealing that they consist of the same basic cell types but in varying proportions. Notably, the gut basal cells are the most responsive to changes in size, suggesting a role in energy storage. We capture the regulated gene modules of distinct cell types in response to body size. This research sheds light on the molecular and cellular aspects of cell-type allometry in planarians and underscores the utility of scRNA-seq in these investigations."

Constraining the maximum extent of these aseismic ruptures is, thus, important for better delineating the influence zone of injections concerning their seismic hazard. Here, we derive a scaling relation based on rupture physics for the maximum size of aseismic ruptures, accounting for fluid injections with arbitrary flow rate histories. Moreover, on the basis of mounting evidence that the moment release during these operations is often predominantly aseismic, we derive a scaling relation for the maximum magnitude of aseismic slip events. Our theoretical predictions are consistent with observations over a broad spectrum of event sizes, from laboratory to real-world cases, indicating that fault zone storativity, background stress change, and injected fluid volume are key determinants of the maximum size and magnitude of injection-induced slow slip events."

Our results showed that notable reductions of the average ozone concentration (2.0 to 12.2 parts per billion by volume) were observed during the 12 dust storm events from 2016 to 2023, relative to predust storm levels. The chemical interactions of dust particles with ozone production processes played crucial roles in explaining approximately 13 to 35% of the observed ozone reduction, alongside the impact of intense meteorological disturbances on transport and formation of ozone. Among these interactions, the uptake of ozone, reactive nitrogen, and hydroperoxyl radical by dust particles could substantially contribute to the ozone suppression.

Loss-of-function mutations inCLN1, encoding palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1), cause CLN1 disease, a devastating neurodegenerative LSD that has no curative treatment. Numerous proteins in the brain require dynamic S-palmitoylation (palmitoylation-depalmitoylation) for trafficking to their destination. Although PPT1 depalmitoylates S-palmitoylated proteins and its deficiency causes CLN1 disease, the underlying pathogenic mechanism has remained elusive. We report that Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a polytopic membrane protein mediating lysosomal cholesterol egress, requires dynamic S-palmitoylation for trafficking to the lysosome. InCln1−/−mice, Ppt1 deficiency misroutes NPC1-dysregulating lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis. Along with this defect, increased oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) promotes cholesterol-mediated activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1), which inhibits autophagy contributing to neurodegeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of OSBP suppresses mTORC1 activation, rescues autophagy, and ameliorates neuropathology inCln1−/−mice.

However, research has predominantly focused on their quasi-static characteristics, leaving their behavior under extreme dynamic conditions, especially at length scales relevant to practical applications largely unexplored. Here, we present a strategy to achieve extreme impact mitigation at the macroscale by combining shell-based microarchitecture with an additively manufactured medium-entropy alloy (MEA) featuring low stacking fault energy (SFE). Notably, the shell-based architecture amplifies the effective dynamic stress within the metamaterial compared to truss-based morphologies, leading to the earlier activation of multiscale toughening mechanisms in the alloy. The low SFE of the MEA enables the evolution of a diverse array of defect types, thereby prolonging strain hardening behavior across seven orders of magnitude in strain rate.

While DUX4 activates similar programs in early embryos and FSHD muscle, the isoform usage of known DUX4 targets is notably distinct between the two contexts. DUX4 also activates hundreds of previously unannotated intergenic loci dominated by repetitive elements. The transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of these loci in myogenic and embryonic contexts indicate that the usage of DUX4-binding sites at these intergenic loci is influenced by the cellular environment.

Pregnancy complications like preeclampsia are associated with altered expression of interferon-stimulated genes, including guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5). Here, we show that misdirected antiviral activity of GBP5 impairs processing and activation of Syncytin-1. In contrast, the proteolytic activation of Syncytin-2 is not affected by GBP5, and its fusogenic activity is only modestly reduced. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Syncytin-1 is mainly cleaved by the GBP5 target furin, whereas Syncytin-2 is also efficiently processed by the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7 (PCSK7) and thus resistant to GBP5-mediated restriction. Mutational analyses mapped PCSK7 processing of Syncytin-2 to a leucine residue upstream of the polybasic cleavage site.

BPD also increases the risk of adult emphysema, marked by alveolar loss. Despite this connection, mechanisms linking these conditions and effective treatments are still lacking. We identify hedgehog-interacting protein (HHIP), associated with both BPD and emphysema, as a critical regulator of alveologenesis. During this process,Hhip-expressing cells expanded, accompanied by hedgehog (Hh) signaling inhibition and myofibroblast transition. Stromal-specificHhipdeletion led to hyperactivation of Hh-IGF1 signaling axis, causing persistent SMA+myofibroblasts and epithelial stem/progenitor cell senescence. Hyperactivation of this pathway was also observed in human BPD and hyperoxia-induced BPD models. EarlyHhipdeficiency resulted in adult emphysema with myofibroblast accumulation.

Using deep potential molecular dynamics simulations with ab initio accuracy, we explored the dissociation dynamics of H2CO3in solution on the nanosecond timescale. While the CC conformer is the most abundant, the CT conformer is the dominant proton donor. This enhanced deprotonation ability arises from the CT conformer’s involvement in more hydrogen-bonding ring structures, enabling diverse proton transfer pathways, and its greater electronic asymmetry, which increases hydrophilicity and destabilizes the hydroxyl group. Furthermore, protons dissociated from the CT conformer demonstrate a stronger preference for the homing pathway.

This is corroborated by x-ray crystallography, which reveals a cryptic epitope recognized by the conformationally selective 2C1 antibody, common to both forms. These data definitively preclude most models of polymerization and are compatible with sequential intermolecular donation of the carboxyl terminus of one molecule into the next during polymer formation."

We characterized 144 human HEV-CA–specific monoclonal antibodies cloned from the memory B cells of HEV-exposed individuals. Most human anti-CA antibodies cross-reacted with all HEV genotype variants, and a subset also recognized the zoonotic rat hepatitis E virus. HEV antibody repertoire was diverse and contained highly potent neutralizing antibodies binding to the CA protruding (P) domain. Structural analyses of CA protein complexed with three potent and broad HEV antibodies uncovered a neutralizing site located on monomeric P domain loops at the apex of the viral spike. These findings provide valuable insights into the protective humoral response to HEV and offer a framework for the rational design of HEV vaccines and immunotherapies."

Conventional methods commonly used are sequential and computing intensive, rendering them inadequate for addressing large-scale and real-time situations. Here, we propose a highly parallel, computation- and energy-efficient approach to shortest path–based graph learning based on an emerging memristor spiking neural network via algorithm-device codesign. The shortest path is obtained parallelly in nature using simultaneous spike traveling instead of arithmetic calculation, achieving extremely low time and space complexity. A nonlinear weight mapping approach is proposed to counterbalance the neuron intrinsic nonlinearity to guarantee accuracy to support large-scale graphs. The memristor hardware capability is experimentally demonstrated in unsupervised and supervised classification tasks. The estimated energy efficiency of 517.82 giga-traversal edges per second per watt outperforms field programmable gate arrays by three to four orders of magnitude, providing a pathway toward highly energy-efficient graph computing hardware."

Here, we report protein cage–spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) that can be used as nanoreactors for quantum dot (QD) synthesis and subsequent intracellular delivery. The resulting QD-SNA structures are monodisperse, colloidally stable, and photoluminescent in aqueous solution. The nanoreactors were prepared using two different proteins (~10 and 12 nanometers in diameter), and CdS, CdSe, and PbSe nanocrystals were synthesized. Moreover, the extent of surface defects and crystallinity depends on the relative concentrations of ionic precursors, which control the growth rate and the number of ionic vacancies. By optimizing conditions, CdS-SNAs that exhibit near-zero reabsorption loss were synthesized. Last, QD-SNAs exhibit enhanced cellular uptake and minimal cytotoxicity when compared to commercial QD-protein conjugates, making them potentially useful in bioimaging and diagnostic applications."

It has long been recognized that sex chromosome–linked drivers present a paradox: Their success in transmission can severely distort populations’ sex ratio and lead to extinction. This paradox is typically solved by the presence of suppressors or fitness costs associated with the driver, limiting the propagation of the driver. Here, we show thatStellate (Ste)inDrosophila melanogasterrepresents a novel class of X chromosome–linked driver that operates with an inherent mechanism that weakens its drive strength. Ste protein asymmetrically segregates into Y-bearing cells during meiosis I, subsequently causing their death. Unexpectedly, Ste segregates asymmetrically again during meiosis II, sparing half of the Y-bearing spermatids from Ste-induced defects, thereby weakening the drive strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which sex chromosome drivers avoid suicidal success."

Their strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry lead to the spin-valley locking effect, in which carriers occupying theKandK′ valleys of the reciprocal space must have opposite spins. This effect is particularly strong for holes due to a larger spin-orbit gap in the valence band. By reducing the dimensionality of a monolayer of WSe2to 1D via electrostatic confinement, we demonstrate that spin-valley locking and strong hole-hole interactions lead to a ferromagnetic state where hole transport is spin-valley polarized, even without an applied magnetic field. A massive Dirac fermion model in the Hartree-Fock approximation reveals that many-body hole-exchange interactions lead to this polarized ground-state. This observation opens the possibility of implementing a robust and stable valley-polarized system, essential in valleytronic applications."

Plasmodesmata (PD) are plant-specific nanopore structures pivotal for cell-to-cell communication and plant survival. However, how PD form and their structure, regulation, and evolution remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the exogenous supply of abscisic acid (ABA), a well-conserved phytohormone in land plants, reduces primary PD density in the mossPhyscomitrium patens. This regulation requires all core components of the ABA signaling pathway. Furthermore, we reveal that ABA-INSENSITIVE 5, a well-conserved transcription factor in the ABA signaling pathway of land plants, plays a pivotal role in PD density regulation, whereas ABA-INSENSITIVE 3 does not. Our findings show that the ABA-induced reduction in primary PD density is mediated by these ABA-responsive factors inP. patens. Considering previous reports on ABA-dependent PD regulation in both moss and angiosperms, we propose that the ABA-mediated control of PD biogenesis and permeability represents a conserved mechanism in land plants, with critical implications for cell-to-cell communication and stress adaptation."
