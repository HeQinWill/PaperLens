In this study, we analyzed the joint impacts of AO plus EP-El Niño or CP-El Niño on precipitation in South China spanning boreal winter from 1961 to 2019. We found that AO and El Niño regulated precipitation over the target region via independent teleconnection pathways. The positive/negative phase of AO can induce an anomalous cyclone/anticyclone in the Indo-Myanmar by initiating a Rossby wave from the North Atlantic, passing through the Mediterranean, Middle East, and then eastward along the subtropical jet stream to the low latitudes of East Asia. This can enhance/weaken the local Indo-Myanmar Trough, and further contribute to above/below-normal precipitation to 100° E–110° E in South China via a stronger/weaker water vapor transport and ascending/descending motion. Through a Gill-type response and/or weaker-than-normal Walker circulation, El Niño generates an anomalous anticyclone over the northwestern Pacific Ocean; specifically, CP-El Niño forces the anomalous anticyclone in the Philippines, and southerly winds on the western flank of the anticyclone can carry moisture to the area between 110° E and 120° E. However, during EP-El Niño, this anomalous anticyclone is active to the east of 130° E, which is unfavorable for precipitation in South China."

In the southwestern plains passing cold fronts are the primary cause of dust; in the understudied northern plains, summertime patterns and southerly pre-frontal winds are most important in the west and east, respectively. These results are valuable to understanding and forecasting dust in this complex source region. 
 The North American Great Plains is a semi-arid and windy environment prone to dust events that produce a variety of hazards to public health, transportation, and land degradation.  Dust has substantial spatial variability across the plains, and the weather responsible for that dust is understudied in most of the plains, especially the northern and eastern plains.  Here we identify specific weather patterns associated with dust occurrence across the plains. We make use of an atmospheric classification that defines 21 weather patterns for the Great Plains that includes various stages of warm and cold frontal passages, northerlies, anticyclones, and summertime patterns not associated with mid-latitude cyclones.  We use the time series of weather pattern to composite satellite and station daily dust observations from 2012–2021. We calculate average dust occurrence for each weather pattern, calculate the contribution of each pattern to local dust loads, and identify the specific weather patterns most important to each location and subregion.  We find no single weather pattern is responsible for dust occurrence in the plains but that different patterns are responsible for dust in different subregions of the Great Plains.  Passing cold fronts are most responsible for dust events in West Texas and New Mexico, southerlies are responsible for those in the northeastern plains of Iowa and the Dakotas, and summer weather patterns produce the majority of dust in the High Plains from Colorado to Canada.  Identifying the dust-producing weather patterns of particular subregions is a valuable step toward understanding dust variability and improving dust predictions, both present and future."

Tests based on self-captured data showcase its excellent accuracy in distinguishing image types and in structure segmentation. With potential applications in astronomical observations, our work pioneers a robust solution for ground-based sky quality assessment, promising advancements in the photometric observation experiments. 
 Infrared thermal cameras offer reliable means of assessing atmospheric conditions by measuring the downward radiance from the sky, facilitating their usage in cloud monitoring endeavors. The precise identification and detection of clouds in images pose great challenges stemming from the indistinct boundaries inherent to cloud formations. Various methodologies for segmentation have been previously suggested. Most of them rely on color as the distinguishing criterion for cloud identification in the visible spectral domain and thus lack the ability to detect cloud structures in gray-scaled images with satisfying accuracy. In this work, we propose a new complete deep-learning framework to perform image classification and segmentation with convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by conducting a series of tests and validations based on self-captured infrared sky images.  Our findings reveal that the models can effectively differentiate between image types and accurately capture detailed cloud structure information at the pixel level, even when trained with a single binary ground-truth mask per input sample. The classifier model achieves an excellent accuracy of 99 % in image type distinction, while the segmentation model attains a mean pixel accuracy of 95 % in our dataset. We emphasize that our framework exhibits strong viability and can be used for infrared thermal ground-based cloud monitoring operations over extended durations. We expect to take advantage of this framework for astronomical applications by providing cloud cover selection criteria for ground-based photometric observations within the StarDICE experiment."

A model was applied to correct for differences in pollen production between different plants, and modern remote-sensing forest cover was used to validate the reconstructed tree cover. Accurate data on past vegetation are invaluable for the investigation of vegetation–climate dynamics and the validation of vegetation models. 
 With rapid anthropogenic climate change, future vegetation trajectories are uncertain. Climate–vegetation models can be useful for predictions, but they require extensive data on past vegetation for validation and improving systemic understanding. Even though pollen data provide a great source of this information, they are compositionally biased due to differences in taxon-specific relative pollen productivity (RPP) and dispersal.Here, we present a Northern Hemisphere reconstruction of quantitative regional vegetation cover from a sedimentary pollen dataset for the last 14 kyr using the REVEALS model to correct for taxon- and basin-specific biases. For the reconstruction, we expanded on a previously published synthesis of continental RPP values.The datasets include the taxonomic composition and reconstructed tree cover for each original pollen sample. Additional metadata include modeled ages, age model sources, basin locations, types, and sizes.The improvements in tree cover reconstructions with the REVEALS reconstruction using continental RPP values range from 22 % (Asia) to 67 % (Europe) relative to the mean absolute error (MAE) of the pollen-based tree cover. The dataset can be used as a grid with binned and aggregated samples (adjustable script provided on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13902976, Schild, 2024) or as individual time series if the record's basin size exceeds 50 ha.This alternative quantitative reconstruction of vegetation cover is beneficial for the investigation of past vegetation dynamics and modern model validation when varying spatial and temporal resolutions may be required. By collecting more RPP estimates, especially in North America, and adding more records to existing pollen data syntheses, reconstructions may be improved even further. The new REVEALS dataset is freely available on PANGAEA (see the Code and data availability section; https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.974798, Herzschuh et al., 2025)."

This manuscript documents key aspects of these datasets, including their history, changes through time, and best use practices. 
 Processes mediating the coupling of terrestrial, aquatic, biospheric, and atmospheric systems influence weather, climate, and ecosystem dynamics via transfer of energy, momentum, water, and carbon (or other species). These exchange processes are quantified by measurements of near surface turbulent fluxes. Understanding processes at these interfaces provides insight into understanding and predicting current and future states within the Earth system. The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility has been conducting measurements of near surface turbulent fluxes since the early 1990's at long term fixed locations and shorter-term, mobile deployments across the Earth. ARM has utilized two established methods for conducting these measurements, energy balance Bowen ratio (EBBR) and eddy covariance (EC). Primary measurements from the former include sensible and latent heat flux, while the latter also measures fluxes of momentum and carbon (primarily carbon dioxide, with methane fluxes measured at select (two to date) locations). The EBBR systems were deployed at 22 locations, and to date, the EC systems have been deployed at over 50 sites with plans for additional novel site locations into the future. Herein, the history, evolution, and key aspects of these instrument systems are documented, along with information on data quality assurance and post-processing, and best use practices. Additionally, three recent data validation experiments were conducted, and their key findings are summarized. Finally, ancillary datasets acquired by ARM, that can contextualize and aid interpretation of the near surface turbulent flux measurements, are discussed."

It identifies 25 sources, including agriculture, wetlands, and fossil fuels, enhancing India’s global data representation. Emissions peak in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and coastal states, highlighting mitigation priorities. Urban emissions are lower, suggesting underestimation. This dataset helps policymakers design targeted reduction strategies, supporting India’s climate goals and global efforts. 
 Methane (CH4) is a predominant climate-forcing agent and has become a focal point of global climate discussions, owing to its significant contribution to atmospheric warming. The ambiguity surrounding the relative contributions of various natural and anthropogenic sources, coupled with associated uncertainties, poses significant challenges to assessing methane emissions in developing nations like India. To address these challenges and better understand the methane-emitting sources, this study presents a comprehensive high-resolution gridded (0.1°×0.1°) inventory of CH4 emission by including 25 distinct anthropogenic and natural sources in India for 2023 by adopting the IPCC bottom-up approach. The estimated CH4 over India is 37.79 Tg/yr, which will redefine the contribution of various sources. The agriculture sector contributed ~50 % followed by wetlands (8.6 %), fossil fuel and waste management. This study reports the first-ever comprehensive emissions from natural sources like wetlands and termites. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and coastal states show elevated emissions with Uttar Pradesh contributing the highest (10.8 %) followed by Gujarat (9.4%), and Maharashtra (8.6 %). However, surprisingly cities exhibit lower CH4 as compared to other semi-urban/rural regions. This developed dataset can be a valuable input to optimize the climate study by filling the data gap, enabling policymakers to formulate various mitigation measures.

Many researchers have examined TBI using comprehensive climate models but have obtained conflicting results. This may be partly due to differences in experiment protocols and partly due to systematic model errors. The Tropical Basin Interaction Model Intercomparison Project (TBIMIP) aims to address this problem by designing a set of TBI experiments that will be performed by multiple models. 
 Large-scale interaction between the three tropical ocean basins is an area of intense research that is often conducted through experimentation with numerical models. A common problem is that modeling groups use different experimental setups, which makes it difficult to compare results and delineate the role of model biases from differences in experimental setups. To address this issue, an experimental protocol for examining interaction between the tropical basins is introduced. The Tropical Basin Interaction Model Intercomparison Project (TBIMIP) consists of experiments in which sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are prescribed to follow observed values in selected basins. There are two types of experiments. One type, called standard pacemaker, consists of simulations in which SSTs are restored to observations in selected basins during a historical simulation. The other type, called pacemaker hindcast, consists of seasonal hindcast simulations in which SSTs are restored to observations during 12-month forecast periods. TBIMIP is coordinated by the Climate and Ocean – Variability, Predictability, and Change (CLIVAR) Research Focus on Tropical Basin Interaction. The datasets from the model simulations will be made available to the community to facilitate and stimulate research on tropical basin interaction and its role in seasonal-to-decadal variability and climate change."

Here, we utilized two Chinese cohorts with repeated follow-up visits to address this knowledge gap and explored the underlying DNA methylation mechanisms. We first conducted a multistate modeling analysis in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS), a nationwide cohort with 21,654 older adults who had participated in at least two survey waves. An interquartile range reduction in PM2.5 exposure increased the likelihood of improvement for frail/prefrail individuals by more than 50% while lowering their risks of worsening frailty or mortality. A quasi-experimental study within a CLHLS subcohort of 1816 adults, leveraging the implementation of China’s Clean Air Act, further validated these findings. Additionally, in the Guangxi Eco-Environmental Health and Aging Study─a regional prospective cohort based in Guilin, China─we included 235 older adults with follow-up data and identified three frailty-related CpG sites that were associated with PM2.5 exposure. The CpG site cg25453797 mapped to the PRKCE gene was robustly associated with the change in frailty. These findings demonstrate that air quality improvement benefits older adults by alleviating the frailty burden.

However, prevailing membrane-based technologies, such as reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodialysis (ED), can hardly handle high concentration differences (ΔC) in a single stage, where multi-stage operation is needed, which increases the operational difficulties and energy input. However, membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) is theoretically applicable to high ΔC. This study explored the feasibility of employing an MCDI in brine concentrating and proposed several regulating measures on the electrode’s porosity, electrical quantity for charging–discharging, and desorption conditions. Based on the determination of salt and water fluxes, these measures were confirmed to mitigate water transfer across the membrane, thereby facilitating salt transportation for brine concentrating. To address the mass imbalance between adsorbed and desorbed, a novel pre-charge strategy was designed, which enabled successful MCDI continuous operation over 50 cycles. A concentration difference of 161 g/L NaCl was achieved per single stage, which is the highest reported result among RO, ED, and MCDI studies. The concentrating rate was as high as 38.4 g/(m2·h) with a comparative energy consumption at RO and ED. This study demonstrated that MCDI is an optional technology for the future application of brine concentrating in ZLD facilities."

It remains a challenge to develop a rationally designed device with a high proportion of adsorbents for increased performance. Herein, using 3,8-diamino-6-phenylphenanthridine (DPP) and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (TP) as monomers, a β-ketoenamine-linked covalent organic framework membrane (TPDPP) was fabricated via interface assembly. TPDPP was further loaded on ultrathin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using solvent evaporation, resulting in a high proportion of TPDPP functional components in the hybrid membrane (TPDPP@PDMS).

The TPDPP@PDMS membranes reproducibly performed simultaneous SPME in a variety of environmental water samples, simplifying the pretreatment process and saving time.

This is the case for zooplankton species, which ensure the coupling between primary producers and fishes in pelagic food webs. Here, we measured lifespan, reproduction, and mobility of laboratory-raised water fleas Daphnia magna, a widespread freshwater zooplankton species, in response to continuous broadband noise. Surprisingly, we found a significant increase in survival and fecundity, leading to a higher individual fitness when considering total offspring production and a slight increase in the population growth rate according to the Euler–Lotka equation. Exposed water fleas were found to be slower than control individuals, and we discussed potential links between mobility and fitness. Our results can have implications in aquaculture and for in-lab studies (e.g., in ecotoxicology) where the acoustic environment receives little attention. Chronic broadband noise can be associated with certain human activities, but the consequences for natural Daphnia populations might differ as reduced velocity could have negative outcomes when considering competition and predation.

Here, we found that NPs, even without significant toxicity (cell survival: 99.11%), amplified the hepatocyte toxicity of Cd2+. Mechanistically, higher Cd2+ uptake (Δ = 23.80%) combined with crucial intracellular desorption behavior of Cd2+ loaded in NPs (desorption rate: 82.70%) were identified as prerequisites for NPs amplifying Cd2+ cytotoxicity. As for toxigenic pathways, the inflammatory response and calcium (Ca) signaling pathway were identified as the primary molecular events leading to the amplification of Cd2+ cytotoxicity. Further phenotypic monitoring revealed that NPs synergized with Cd2+ to induce more severe pyroptosis and apoptosis by activating the inflammatory caspase-1-dependent and Ca2+-mitochondrial-caspase-3 pathways to a greater extent, respectively.

We performed friction experiments on simulated bassanite gouges under various confining pressures and temperatures. At room temperature (RT), stress drops and recurrence intervals of stick‐slip events varied with confining pressures. Under a confining pressure of 200 MPa and 110°C, stress drops and recurrence intervals decreased over time. Microstructures indicate that gouges deformed under RT contain numerous Riedel shears. On the other hand, a sample deformed under the confining pressure of 200 MPa and 110°C had few Riedel shear planes. Above observations indicate that the elevated pore pressure by the dehydration of bassanite gouges reduces the effective pressures controlling slip behaviors and suppresses the development of shear planes. We derived time function of dehydration‐driven pore pressure evolution using Avrami kinetics, which can be expressed by the Weibull distribution function representing the failure probability. Our result shows that the kinetics‐driven pore fluid evolution controlled the stick‐slip behaviors of the bassanite gouges."

Kim,In Situ Analysis of Jupiter's Broadband Kilometric Auroral Radio Emissions With Juno,"Among the zoo of Jovian auroral radio emissions, the broadband kilometric (bKOM) component has been the least studied. Taking advantage of Juno in situ measurements within the auroral regions, we surveyed the Juno/Waves radio observations over the 60 first orbits to identify 7 bKOM source candidates. These were mostly detected during dawn storm auroral episodes (4/7) and three were found to be colocated with auroral cavities. By applying a growth rate analysis based on JADE‐E electron measurements, we show that the observed waves are driven by the Cyclotron Maser Instability from two free energy sources. The main emission, produced slightly above the electron gyrofrequency fce $\left({f}_{ce}\right)$, is amplified by conics‐type electron distribution functions (EDF) with 2–30 keV electron characteristic energies. Sporadic bursts, produced slightly below fce ${f}_{ce}$, are driven by shell‐type EDF of 0.1–10 keV. These results are analyzed comparatively to those obtained previously for Jovian hectometric and decametric emissions."

DDT formation does not correlate with elevation, indicating it does not depend on ambient atmospheric pressure. Locations and timing of DDTs are similar to active dust devils, with several regional exceptions. DDTs are most common in areas characterized by low albedo and moderate thermal inertia, where thin layers of dust overlie larger‐grained material that provides an albedo contrast when uncovered by the passage of an atmospheric vortex.

This study demonstrates that the intensification of WNPAC is preceded by a reduction in western North Pacific tropical cyclones (WNPTCs) approximately 2 months earlier. By estimating the relative vorticity associated with WNPTCs, we find that reduced WNPTC activity accounts for about 33% of WNPAC variability from November of the El Niño year to September of the following year. This reduction is primarily driven by decreased relative humidity at 600 hPa, with low‐level vorticity changes playing a minor role. Our finding of the significant impact of WNPTCs on the WNPAC aligns with the circulation theorem and enhances the dynamical understanding of WNPAC changes induced by El Niño."

Isotope measurements (δ18O) on these samples enable us to estimate surface paleotemperatures for both the current interglacial period and the Last Glacial Maximum. Combining these paleotemperatures with the spatially varying source elevation of the sampled blue ice provides new insights on the (lack of) lapse rate evolution (i.e., changes in the elevation‐temperature relationship) outside the 40°N–40°S latitudinal band. This result contrasts with low‐latitude areas that have experienced elevation‐dependent warming (EDW) during this period.

 Long-term terrestrial ecosystem development is characterized by declining soil phosphorus (P) and a corresponding increase in biological P limitation. The function of P-limited ecosystems relies on efficient use of P by soil microorganisms, but the physiological strategies used by microorganisms to manage P scarcity during ecosystem development are unknown. Here, by applying recent advances in soil metabolomic techniques to samples collected from a ~700,000-year chronosequence of ecosystem development in eastern Australia, we show that soil microbial physiological strategies for P efficiency include a high proportion of non-phosphorous membrane lipids along with substantial intracellular carbon storage. These strategies—which proliferate during primary succession and are maximized in retrogressive, P-depleted ecosystems—uphold microbial carbon limitation, triple modelled P-mineralization potential and can conserve close to double the P contained in the aboveground biomass of vegetation. These findings transform our understanding of terrestrial ecosystems by revealing a strong yet overlooked interplay between the ecophysiology of soil microorganisms and the long-term trajectory of ecosystem development.

 Beneath Antarctica’s ice sheets, a little-observed network of liquid water connects vast landscapes and contributes to the motion of the overriding ice. When this subglacial water reaches the ocean cavity beneath ice shelves, it mixes with seawater, amplifying melt and in places forming deep channels in the base of the ice. Here we present observations from a hot-water-drilled borehole documenting subglacial water entering the ocean cavity at the grounding zone of Kamb Ice Stream and the Ross Ice Shelf. Our observations show that melt has removed approximately a third of the ice thickness, yet measurements reveal low rates of subglacial discharge in a turbid plume. Sediment cored from the channel floor shows larger discharge events occur and episodically deposit material from distinct geological domains. We quantify subglacial discharge and link our observations to the catchment upstream. We conclude that discrete discharge events are likely to dominate channel melt and sediment transport and result in the extensive ice-shelf features downstream of Kamb Ice Stream.

Here, the authors report a co-initiating system for fabrication of printable entangled networks. 
 Entanglement significantly enhances the mechanical performance and functionality of both natural and synthetic materials. However, developing straightforward, versatile strategies for creating high-performance entangled polymer materials remains a challenge. Here, a co-initiating-system dual-mechanism strategy is designed for fabricating printable entangled polymer multinetworks. This thermal-light dual-initiation process benefits the synthesis of high-molecular-weight polymers and promotes the rapid formation of multinetworks within hydrogels. The resulting long polymer chains enable hydrogels with higher mechanical performance, lower stress relaxation, and activation energy compared to short polymer chain-contained samples. Such a method proves more effective than traditional self-thickening and strengthening techniques for enhancing hydrogel entanglements and is also compatible with additive manufacturing, enabling the design of complex 2D webs with adaptive mechanical performance and capable of detecting and sensing applications. This work provides an effective strategy for designing high-performance entangled polymer materials, which are set to impact numerous fields, from advanced sensing to material science and beyond.

 Although histone modifications are linked with chromatin activities such as transcription, proofs of their causal importance remain limited. Sequence variants within each histone family expand chromatin diversity and may carry specific modifications, further raising questions about their coordination. Here, we investigate the role of lysine 4 (K4) in two Arabidopsis H3 variants, H3.1 and H3.3. K4 is essential for H3.3 function but not H3.1 in plant development. Mutating K4 in H3.3 drastically reduced H3K4 methylation levels and mimicked the transcriptomic effects of losing SDG2, the major H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) methyltransferase. Moreover, H3.3K4 and SDG2 are required for de novo gene activation and RNA Pol II elongation. H3K4 methylation is preferentially enriched on H3.3, likely due to the coordinated activity of H3.3 deposition and H3K4 methylation. Furthermore, we reveal the diverse impacts of K4 nearby residue mutations on H3K4 methylation and H3.3 function. These findings highlight H3.3 as a critical substrate for H3K4 methylation, which is important for gene expression regulation. Sequence variation between histones expands chromatin diversity.

Here, authors propose entropy regulation with zero Li/Co usage to suppress lattice strain, enhancing structural stability and improving the electrochemical performance. 
 Transition-metal (TM) layered oxides have emerged as the primary cathode choice for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high energy density and sustainable chemistry using non-critical elements. However, their anisotropic lattice strain and stress accumulation during (de)sodiation lead to severe structural degradation, yet an intrinsic strain-depressant approach remains elusive. Herein, we propose entropy regulation with zero Li/Co usage to mitigate harmful lattice displacements and enhance the electrochemical performance of sodium layered cathodes. Our findings demonstrate that high entropy design effectively inhibits TMO6 octahedra distortions upon cycling, as evidenced by hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy, greatly reducing near-surface structural deconstruction and interface side reactions. Furthermore, multicationic interactions driven by configurational entropy thermodynamically mitigate the formation of oxygen defects and strengthen ligand-to-metal coordination. The complementarity inherent in charge compensation within complex systems is unveiled and the restrained lattice parameters deviations without interior volume residuals are successfully achieved. As a result, the multicationic cathode exhibits improved cycling stability and Na+ diffusion kinetics in both half and full cells. The cathode chemistries outlined here broaden the prospects for lattice engineering to alleviate bulk fatigue and open up the possibility to develop an economically viable layered oxides with long durability.

 Strong and lightweight materials are highly desired. Here we report the emergence of a compressive strength exceeding 2 GPa in a directly printed poly(ethylene glycol) micropillar. This strong and highly crosslinked micropillar is not brittle, instead, it behaves like rubber under compression. Experimental results show that the micropillar sustains a strain approaching 70%, absorbs energy up to 310 MJ/m3, and displays an almost 100% recovery after cyclic loading. Simple micro-lattices (e.g., honeycombs) of poly(ethylene glycol) also display high strength at low structural densities. By combining a series of control experiments, computational simulations and in situ characterization, we find that the key to achieving such mechanical performance lies in the fabrication of a highly homogeneous structure with suppressed defect formation. Our discovery unveils a generalizable approach for achieving a performance leap in polymeric materials and provides a complementary approach to enhance the mechanical performance of low-density latticed structures.

 Water plays an essential role in enzyme structure, stability, and the substantial rate enhancement of enzyme catalysis. However, direct observations linking enzyme catalysis and active-site water dynamics pose a significant challenge due to experimental difficulties. By integrating an ultraviolet (UV) photolysis technique with temperature-controlled X-ray crystallography, we track the catalytic pathway of carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) at 1.2 Å resolution. This approach enables us to construct molecular movies of CAII catalysis, encompassing substrate (CO2) binding, conversion from substrate to product (bicarbonate), and product release. In the catalytic pathway, we identify an unexpected configuration in product binding and correlate it with sub-nanosecond rearrangement of active-site water. Based on these experimental observations, we propose a comprehensive mechanism of CAII and describe the detailed structure and dynamics of active-site water in CAII. Our findings suggest that CAII has evolved to utilize the structure and fast dynamics of the active-site waters for its diffusion-limited catalytic efficiency.

 Antarctic ice shelves typically comprise continental meteoric ice, in situ-accumulated meteoric ice, and marine ice accumulated at the shelf base. Using borehole optical televiewer logs from across Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula, we identify and report an intermediate ice unit, located between continental and in situ meteoric ice, that is tens of metres thick and formed of layers that progressively increase in dip (by ~60°) with depth. The unit’s stratigraphic position and depth, supported by flowline modelling, indicate formation at the grounding zone. We hypothesise that the unit forms due to changes in the surface slope of feeder glaciers at the grounding zone, resulting in both variable surface accumulation and intense deformation. The top of the unit also marks the depth at which lateral consistency in radar layering is lost from radargrams, which may, to some degree, mark the depth of grounding zone ice across all ice shelves.

 Efficient uranium extraction from seawater has the potential to secure an abundant and reliable supply of nuclear fuel, providing affordable energy with minimized carbon emissions. Among the many extraction methods, the electrochemical route has emerged as a promising choice owing to its fast kinetics and materials regeneration. The major challenges facing this technology, however, lie in its high energy consumption, low extraction efficiency and poor selectivity. Here we show a bipolar electrochemical uranium extraction (EUE) system that combines cathodic direct electroreduction of uranium species and electrochemistry-assisted indirect uranium reduction at the anode.

 The sustainable separation of hydrocarbons from crude oil is critical for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in the chemical industry. Current methods are energy intensive and do not allow for isolation of specific hydrocarbons due to overlapping physicochemical properties and molecular complexities in crude oil. Here we introduce an energy-efficient molecular sieving strategy using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) aqueous solution to directly extract cyclohexane (CH) from crude oil. CB[7] enables efficient CH separation under ambient and harsh conditions through shape- and size-selective binding with an ultrahigh affinity (2.5 × 109 M−1). Industrial validation shows >99% CH purity from azeotropic benzene mixtures and crude distillates and achieves 57.4–82.4% energy savings compared with current industrial methods. By demonstrating the scalability and robustness of CB[7]-based separations, this work highlights the potential of molecular sieves for sustainable, cost-effective hydrocarbon recovery from crude oil, paving the way for large-scale, sustainable hydrocarbon purification.

 The role of submesoscale processes as the primary energy source for ocean turbulence remains controversial due to observational limitations. Seismic imaging captures multi-scale processes from mesoscale to finescale, allowing us to infer turbulence processes. This study identified hundreds of ~200-m-long high seismic reflection patches, primarily caused by vertical temperature changes, moving at 0.24 ± 0.13 m/s across the deep-reaching front of Bransfield Current, Antarctica. Patch distribution within the main current is uneven, increasing exponentially towards the frontal leading edge. Over 95% of the detected patches are concentrated within 10 km from the frontal leading edge, where elevated Thorpe-scale diffusivity exceeding 10−2 m2/s has been observed hydrographically. These patches may indicate stratified turbulence, including broken internal wave segments, interleaving interfaces, and overturns, which may correspond to wave breaking, frontal instability, and shear instability, respectively. Our findings challenge the recently questioned classical hypothesis that energy cascades directly from internal waves to isotropic turbulence, instead supporting the paradigm of a stratified turbulence stage."

 U-Pb carbonate geochronology can directly constrain the timing and rates of important geological processes. However, the mechanisms and controls on U incorporation, distribution, and retention in carbonate minerals remain unclear, limiting geological interpretations. Here X-ray absorption spectroscopy (µXAS) and in-situ U-Pb carbonate geochronology are combined to temporally track U distribution and redox state in a porphyry-epithermal system. In this setting, multiple generations of carbonate minerals record fluid conditions and processes which control the solubility and deposition of metals, including U. This novel approach provides the first evidence of both oxidized UO22+ and reduced U4+ species in temporally distinct generations of carbonate within a single sample. Preservation of two different U oxidation states during discrete precipitation events requires U retentivity within older domains, demonstrating that the U-Pb carbonate geochronometer is robust under hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, crystal zones with abundant fluid/vapour inclusions linked to boiling processes coincide with relatively high levels of U and favourable U/Pb. Targeting carbonate domains with these textures may therefore increase success in U-Pb geochronology. U-Pb carbonate dating combined with µXAS can track the temporal evolution of processes critical for metal deposition in long-lived and multistage hydrothermal-magmatic ore deposit settings.

 The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently marked a transformative shift in the realms of 3D representation, efficient rendering, and novel view synthesis. Despite its advancements, the geometric precision, photometric consistency, and the quality of novel view synthesis continue to pose significant challenges in the context of large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based 3D reconstruction. To tackle these challenges, we propose a geometry-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting Approach, incorporating three novel methods specifically designed for large-scale UAV-based reconstruction. Firstly, recognizing that existing LiDAR-supervised 3DGS methods are primarily utilized for optimizing Gaussian properties derived from Structure from Motion (SfM), we introduce a precise 3DGS initialization method that leverages highly accurate dense LiDAR point clouds precisely registered with imagery. By extracting depth, normal, and curvature information from the dense UAV LiDAR point cloud, we enhance geometric accuracy through geometric supervision in complex large-scale outdoor scenes. Secondly, addressing the limitations of current photometric supervision in 3DGS, which struggles with illumination variations due to the constraints of spherical harmonics (SH) color representation and lighting changes, we propose a spatial–temporal SH method. This innovative method aims to refine photometric consistency by dynamically adapting to varying lighting conditions, thereby improving the overall quality of 3D reconstruction in diverse environmental settings. Through these methods, our approach seeks to advance the capabilities of 3DGS in large-scale UAV-based 3D reconstruction, offering improved geometric accuracy, photometric consistency, and novel view synthesis quality.Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional SLAM-based reconstruction and multi-view reconstruction approaches. In large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks that use both UAV LiDAR point clouds and imagery, our method achieves a 31.25 % improvement in geometric accuracy while consistently surpassing existing methods in the quality metrics of novel view synthesis. Furthermore, our approach attains a PSNR exceeding 30 dB and optimizes photometric consistency, enhancing rendering quality and visual realism."

 Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP, ≤100 nm) is an emerging health concern linked to premature mortality, with jet fuel combustion identified as a significant source of UFPs near airports. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption has the potential to reduce aviation-related UFPs and may particularly benefit populations who reside nearby. However, assessing aviation-specific impacts on health remains challenging due to the lack of tools capable of addressing: fine-scale exposure evaluation, novel ambient pollutants, and groups with increased exposure or susceptibility.We develop and apply a method to estimate reductions in mortality associated with aviation-related UFP reductions at the Seattle-Tacoma (SEA-TAC) International Airport under SAF adoption scenarios, with a focus on near-airport communities. Using UFP exposure surfaces generated from AERMOD modeling, flight count data, and UFP measurements, we evaluated UFP reductions under various control scenarios. We estimated mortality reductions by combining this with population data, baseline mortality, and a hazard ratio of 1.012 (95 % confidence interval: 1.010, 1.015) per interquartile range increment of 2723 particles/cm3.Our analysis included 412 census tracts representing almost 1.5 million adults. Baseline aviation-related UFP exposures averaged 1145 (SD: 277) particles/cm3. The highest baseline concentrations and subsequent reductions under SAF scenarios were near SEA-TAC. Mortality case reductions averaged between 3.1 (95 % range: 2.5–3.7) for a 5 % UFP reduction to 31.0 (24.6–37.4) for a 50 % reduction, with corresponding mortality rate reductions of 0.2 (0.2–0.3) to 2.1 (1.7–2.5) cases per 100,000 people per year. Mortality rate reductions were larger among populations residing closer to SEA-TAC, including those that were Hispanic or Latino, below-poverty, and did not identify as White.Reducing aviation-related UFPs through SAF adoption could lead to lower mortality, particularly in near-airport communities. This reproducible approach can be adapted to other settings to evaluate health benefits from aviation-related UFP reductions."

 During the last decades several gridded climatic datasets have been developed offering thus long-term, continuous, and spatially uniform records of key hydrometeorological parameters. Few studies, however, have rigorously evaluated the accuracy and reliability of these datasets, especially in regions characterized by complex topography and sparse observational data, such as the Mediterranean. Moreover, even fewer have explored how uncertainties inherent in these datasets affect derived climatic indices. To address this gap, the present study deals with the application of ground station measurements and a gridded dataset (CRU_TS 4.04) to estimate the aridity index (AI) and Thornthwaite's Moisture index (Im) over the Greek peninsula for three different consecutive climatic periods. Ground station data estimations are compared against the outcomes of the respective gridded datasets. Results show that the application of gridded data led to AI values increase in many areas, altering the aridity classification from semi-arid (SA) to sub-humid (SH) or humid (H) categories. Further, the application of gridded data led to both underestimations and overestimations of the Im, depending on the site: more dry conditions along the western coast (in most cases) and the eastern Aegean islands (with significant differences in some of the islands) and more humid conditions over the northwestern mainland and the southern part along with the Aegean islands. These results suggest that while gridded datasets always offer an alternative, careful consideration is required when they are used in regions characterized by complex topography (heterogenous terrain, site continentality and extensive land-sea contrast) and also temporal climatic variability."
