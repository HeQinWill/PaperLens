10.5194/acp-25-705-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了混合相层积云中冰晶数浓度 (ICNC) 与云滴数浓度 (CDNC) 的比率 (ICNC/CDNC) 对云的特性和云-气溶胶相互作用的影响。研究使用大涡模拟 (LES) 方法，比较了极地和中纬度混合相层积云的案例，发现ICNC/CDNC比率在影响云中潜热过程，进而影响云的液态水和冰态水的比例，以及云与气溶胶的相互作用方面起着关键作用。该研究认为ICNC/CDNC可以作为简化的通用因子，有助于更好地理解和参数化混合相云及其与气溶胶的相互作用。虽然研究与大气过程密切相关，但它主要关注的是云的微物理过程和气候模拟，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的直接关系并不强。,"['cloud properties', 'aerosol-cloud interaction', 'ice crystal number concentration', 'cloud droplet number concentration', 'large-eddy simulation', 'mixed-phase stratocumulus clouds', 'climate modeling']",Seoung Soo Lee;Chang Hoon Jung;Jinho Choi;Young Jun Yoon;Junshik Um;Youtong Zheng;Jianping Guo;Manguttathil G. Manoj;Sang-Keun Song,Role of a key microphysical factor in mixed-phase stratocumulus clouds and their interactions with aerosols,"This study attempts to test a general factor that explains differences in the properties of different mixed-phase clouds using a modeling tool. Although this attempt is not to identify a factor that can perfectly explain and represent the properties of different mixed-phase clouds, we believe that this attempt acts as a valuable stepping stone towards a more complete, general way of using climate models to better predict climate change. 
 This study examines the ratio of ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) to cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), that is ICNC / CDNC, in mixed-phase stratocumulus clouds. This examination is performed using a large-eddy simulation (LES) framework and is one of the efforts toward a more general understanding of mechanisms controlling cloud development and aerosol–cloud interactions, as well as the impacts of ice processes on them in mixed-phase stratocumulus clouds. For the examination, this study compares a case of polar mixed-phase stratocumulus clouds to one of midlatitude mixed-phase stratocumulus clouds with weak precipitation. It is found that ICNC / CDNC plays a critical role in causing differences in cloud development with respect to the relative proportion of liquid and ice mass between the cases by affecting in-cloud latent-heat processes. Note that this proportion has an important implication for cloud radiative properties and, thus, for climate. It is also found that ICNC / CDNC plays a critical role in causing differences in the interactions between clouds and aerosols and in the impacts of ice processes on clouds and their interactions with aerosols between the cases by affecting in-cloud latent-heat processes. Findings of this study suggest that ICNC / CDNC can be a simplified general factor that contributes to a more general understanding and parameterization of mixed-phase clouds, their interactions with aerosols and the roles of ice processes within them."

 Radiocarbon (14C) is an optimal tracer of methane emissions, as 14C measurements enable distinguishing between fossil methane and biogenic methane (CH4). However, 14C measurements in atmospheric methane are still rare, mainly because of the technical challenge of collecting enough carbon for 14C analysis from ambient air samples. In this study, we address this challenge by advancing the system in Zazzeri et al. (2021) into a much more compact and portable sampler and by coupling the sampler with the MICADAS (MIni CArbon DAting System) accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) system at ETH Zurich, using a gas interface.Here, we present the new sampler setup, the assessment of the system contamination and a first inter-laboratory comparison with LARA (Laboratory for the Analysis of Radiocarbon with AMS) at the University of Bern.With our sampling line, we achieved a very low blank, 0.7 µgC compared to 5.5 µgC in Zazzeri et al. (2021), and a sample precision of 0.9 %, comparable with other measurement techniques for 14CH4, while reducing the sample size to 60 L of air. We show that this technique, with further improvements, will enable routine 14CH4 measurements in the field for an improved understanding of CH4 sources."

This paper describes data acquisition and processing and provides maps in unprecedented detail of this area affected by geological changes and human impacts. The findings support future geological and geomorphological investigations and mapping and monitoring of the seafloor and habitats. 
 High-resolution bathymetry provides critical information to marine geoscientists. Bathymetric big data help characterise the seafloor and its benthic habitats, understand sedimentary records, and support the development of offshore engineering infrastructures. From 27 September to 20 October 2022, the new CNR research vessel Gaia Blu explored the seafloor of the Naples and Pozzuoli gulfs and the Amalfi coastal area (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) from 50 to more than 2000 m water depth, acquiring about 5000 km2 of multi-beam echo sounder data. This area is particularly vulnerable to abrupt changes driven by the dynamics of several volcanic complexes, active in the area, and by human-induced impacts reflecting the proximity to the highly populated and touristic coastal area of Naples and nearby famous islands. For these reasons, the seafloor of the area needs to be known and constantly monitored. The digital bathymetric data previously available are restricted to the shallow highly dynamic area of the Gulf of Naples and appear fragmented as they were acquired in successive years, with different goals thereby using a variety of devices, with markedly different spatial resolutions. In this paper, we present bathymetric maps of the Gulf of Naples and adjacent slope basins at unprecedented resolution using three state-of-the-art multi-beam echo sounders. These high-resolution data highlight the technological advances of geophysical surveys achieved over the last 20 years and contribute to assessing the most dynamic areas where changes in the seafloor over time can be quantified. The new digital multi-resolution bathymetric products are openly accessible via Marine Geosciences Data System MGDS (refer to “Data availability” section, Table 8, for datasets and product DOIs), perfectly matching the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) and open science principles."

 Seafloor topography, as a fundamental marine spatial geographic information, plays a vital role in marine observation and science research. With the growing demand for high-precision bathymetric models, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network is used to integrate multi-source marine geodetic data in this paper.

The multi-source marine geodetic data used include gravity anomaly data released by the Shandong University of Science and Technology, the vertical gravity gradient and the vertical deflection data released by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), and the mean dynamic topography data released by Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). First, input and output data are organized from the multi-source marine geodetic data to train the MLP model. Second, the input data at interesting points are fed into the MLP model to obtain prediction bathymetry. Finally, a high-precision bathymetric model with a resolution of 1′ × 1′ has been constructed for the global marine area.

Our contribution provides a novel, spatially-explicit dataset on eight forest structural diversity metrics. 
 Forest structural diversity, defined as the heterogeneity of canopy structural elements in space, is an important axis of functional diversity and is central to understanding the relationship between canopy structure, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning. Despite the recognised importance of forest structural diversity, the development of specific data products has been hindered by the challenges associated with collecting information on forest structure over large spatial scales. However, the advent of novel spaceborne LiDAR sensors like the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is now revolutionising the assessment of forest structural diversity by providing high-quality information on forest structural parameters with a quasi-global coverage. Whilst the availability of GEDI data and the computational capacity to handle large datasets have opened up new opportunities for mapping structural diversity, GEDI only collects sparse measurements of vegetation structure. Continuous information of forest structural diversity over large spatial domains may be needed for a variety of applications. The aim of this study was to create wall-to-wall maps of canopy structural diversity in European forests using a predictive modelling framework based on machine learning. We leverage multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to create a series of input features that were related to eight different structural diversity metrics, calculated using GEDI. The models proved to be robust, indicating that active radar and passive optical data can effectively be used to predict structural diversity. Our dataset finds applications in a range of disciplines, including ecology, hydrology, and climate science. As our models can be regularly rerun as new images become available, it can be used to monitor the impacts of climate change and land use management on forest structural diversity."

It decomposes the internal tide field into 60 plane waves at each point, giving numerous long-range beams that contain key information on their generation, propagation, and dissipation. 
 An internal tide model ZHAO30yr is developed using 30 years of satellite altimetry sea surface height measurements from 1993 to 2022 by a newly improved mapping technique that consists of two rounds of plane wave analysis with a spatial bandpass filter in between. Prerequisite wavelengths are obtained using climatological annual-mean hydrographic profiles in the World Ocean Atlas 2018. The model contains 12 internal tide constituents: 8 mode-1 constituents (M2, S2, N2, K2, K1, O1, P1, and Q1) and 4 mode-2 constituents (M2, S2, K1, and O1). Model errors are estimated to be lower than 1 mm in amplitude, thanks to the new mapping technique and long data record. The model is evaluated by making internal tide correction to independent altimetry data in 2023. Ten constituents (but for K2 and Q1) can reduce variance on global average; K2 and Q1 can cause variance reductions in their source regions. The model decomposes the multiconstituent multimodal multidirectional internal tide field into a series of plane waves at each grid point. The decomposition reveals unprecedented features previously masked by multiwave interference. The model divides each internal tide constituent into components by propagation direction. The directionally-decomposed components reveal numerous long-range internal tidal beams associated with notable topographic features.

It was not clear that acceptable accuracy could be achieved because of computational and data limitations, but the model's predictions agreed well with observations. When we used the model to examine ocean temperature trends in areas that lack observations, it indicated that some seasons and areas are warming faster than others. 
 Decadal-scale oceanographic, environmental, and ecological changes have been reported in the Salish Sea, an ecologically productive inland sea in the northeast Pacific that supports the economies and cultures of millions of people. However, there are substantial data gaps related to physical water properties that make it difficult to evaluate trends and the pathways of effects between physical ocean water properties and the productivity of marine ecosystems. With the aim of addressing these gaps, we present the Hindcast of the Salish Sea (HOTSSea) v1, a 3D physical oceanographic model developed using the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) ocean engine, with temporal coverage from 1980–2018. We used an experimental approach to incrementally assess sensitivity to atmospheric and ocean reanalysis products used for boundary forcings and to the horizontal discretisation of the model grid (∼ 1.5 km). Biases inherited from forcings were quantified, and a simple temperature bias correction factor applied at one ocean boundary was found to substantially improve model skill. Evaluation of salinity and temperature indicates performance is best in the Strait of Georgia. Relatively large biases occur in near-surface waters, especially in subdomains with topography narrower than the model grid's horizontal resolution. However, we demonstrated that the model simulates temperature anomalies and a secular warming trend over the entire water column in general agreement with observations. HOTSSea v1 provided a first look at spatially and temporally heterogenous ocean temperature trends throughout the northern and central part of the domain where observations are sparse. Overall, despite the biases inherited from forcings and a relatively coarse horizontal discretisation, HOTSSea v1 performs well at representing temperature and salinity at the spatial–temporal scales needed to support research related to decadal-scale climate effects on marine ecosystems, fish, and fisheries. We conclude by underscoring the need to further extend the hindcast to capture a regime shift that occurred in the 1970s."
10.1021/acs.est.4c08340,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了单萜衍生的α-酰氧烷基氢过氧化物（AAHPs）与铁离子在水相中的Fenton类反应。AAHPs是一类重要的有机过氧化物，由烯烃臭氧分解过程中产生的Criegee中间体形成，对大气气溶胶的化学、组成和健康影响具有深远意义。研究发现，AAHPs对Fe3+基本不反应，但对Fe2+反应性很高。反应速率常数受pH值、水含量和温度的影响。此外，AAHPs通过Fenton类反应主要生成烷氧基自由基，OH自由基的产率较低。研究还发现，包括松属酮酸衍生的AAHP在内的几种常见过氧化物，在溶解的α-蒎烯二次有机气溶胶中也表现出对Fe2+的高反应性和对Fe3+的低反应性。定量分析表明，Fenton类反应是AAHPs在大气中转化的重要甚至主要驱动力，这将显著影响大气多相化学和气溶胶的健康影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它揭示了大气气溶胶的重要化学过程，这些过程会影响气溶胶的物理和光学性质，而这些性质是卫星和地面遥感技术监测的目标。虽然论文没有直接讨论具体的遥感技术，但其研究结果有助于改进大气化学模型，从而提高遥感数据的解释和应用，例如改进空气质量监测和预测模型。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Aerosol chemistry', 'Cloud chemistry', 'Air quality', 'Multiphase chemistry', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Monoterpenes', 'Organic peroxides', 'Iron', 'Fenton reactions', 'Satellite observations (indirectly)']",Chongxuan Chang;Han Zang;Min Yao;Chenxi Li;Ziyue Li;Shunyao Wang;Ru-Jin Huang;Yue Zhao,Rapid Iron-Mediated Aqueous-Phase Reactions of Organic Peroxides from Monoterpene-Derived Criegee Intermediates and Implications for Aerosol and Cloud Chemistry,"Fenton-like reactions between organic peroxides and transition-metal ions in the atmospheric aqueous phase have profound impacts on the chemistry, composition, and health effects of aerosols. However, the kinetics, mechanisms, and key influencing factors of such reactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we synthesized a series of monoterpene-derived α-acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (AAHPs), an important class of organic peroxides formed from Criegee intermediates during the ozonolysis of alkenes, and investigated their Fenton-like reactions with iron ions in the aqueous phase. We found that the AAHPs are essentially chemically inert to Fe3+ but highly reactive toward Fe2+. The aqueous-phase reaction rate constant between AAHPs and Fe2+ (kIIAAHP+Fe(II)) was determined to range between 11.0 ± 0.8 and 150.0 ± 3.3 M–1 s–1, depending positively on the solution pH (1–3), water content (50%–90%), and temperature (8–25 °C). Meanwhile, the kIIAAHP+Fe(II) value is linearly correlated to the O/C ratio of AAHPs, which allows for the estimation of the Fenton-like reactivity of AAHPs based on their oxygenation level. In addition, the decomposition of AAHPs via Fenton-like reactions with Fe2+ predominantly yields alkoxy (RO) radicals with the production yield of OH radicals smaller than 16%. Similar to synthesized AAHPs, several abundant peroxides including the pinonic acid-derived AAHP exhibit high Fenton-like reactivity toward Fe2+ but low reactivity toward Fe3+ in dissolved α-pinene secondary organic aerosol. A quantitative analysis based on the measured kinetics suggests that Fenton-like reactions are important and even dominant drivers behind the transformation of AAHPs in the atmosphere, which would significantly affect atmospheric multiphase chemistry and aerosol health impacts."

However, transit use produces smaller externalities relative to private vehicles and is cheaper but can increase travel time. Here we compare the benefits and costs of real TNC trips in Chicago to a counterfactual in which they are performed by transit. We assess total fare and monetized value of travel time, as well as externalities. We find that the median breakeven value of time at which a rider would be indifferent between transit and a TNC, $34/hour (interquartile range: $21–60), is almost exactly equal to the regional median wage, which in turn is a metric that is commonly used to value travel time for business purposes. Internalizing externalities would require riders to value their time at $37/hour ($22–64). Transit use and electrification of TNC gasoline vehicles could reduce air emissions externalities to a similar extent assuming current transit load factors. Half of transit trips’ duration consists of walking and waiting; policies that reduce walking and waiting would make transit more attractive."

However, the stability of the precursor signals in AO for Asian surface air temperature (SAT), which is important for short‐term climate prediction, has received little attention. In this study, a strengthened relationship is identified between the late‐winter AO and the early spring SAT over North and Northeast Asia (NNA) around the 1990s. During 1990–2022, a positive (negative) phase of AO during late winter is generally followed by significant warming (cooling) anomalies in the NNA during early spring, whereas this relationship is insignificant during 1961–1987. Further result shows a good persistence of the late‐winter AO to early spring after the 1990s. Accordingly, the AO exerts a strengthened impact on Mongolian anticyclone and Asian westerly anomalies through modulation of a Rossby wave train that propagates from the Arctic to the NNA in early spring, leading to significant SAT anomalies at NNA. Additionally, the AO‐related temperature anomalies intensified in the stratosphere after the 1990s, linking AO and stratospheric polar vortex (SPV). The intensified (weakened) SPV following positive (negative) AO facilitates warming (cooling) anomalies at NNA via downward‐propagating Eliassen‐Palm fluxes at wave number 1 and circumpolar westerlies in middle and lower troposphere. The seasonal persistence of AO and the strengthened relationship between AO and SPV synergistically enhance the influence of late‐winter AO on early spring SAT in the NNA, which might be attributed to the interdecadal changes in background circulation over the Arctic."

Repert;Ruth C. Heindel;Sheila F. Murphy;Kaitlyn M. Jeanis,Relationship of Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition to Soil Nitrogen Cycling Along an Elevation Gradient in the Colorado Front Range,"Microbial processing of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition regulates the retention and mobilization of N in soils, with important implications for water quality. Understanding the links between N deposition, microbial communities, N transformations, and water quality is critical as N deposition shifts toward reduced N and remains persistently high in many regions. Here, we investigated these connections along an elevation transect in the Colorado Front Range. Although rates of N deposition and pools of extractable N increased down the elevation transect, soil microbial communities and N transformation rates did not follow clear elevational patterns. The subalpine microbial community was distinct, corresponding to a high C:N ratio and low pH, while the microbial communities at the lower elevation sites were all very similar. Net nitrification, mineralization, and nitrification potential rates were highest at the Plains (1,700 m) and Montane (2,527 m) sites, suggesting that these ecosystems mobilize N. In contrast, the net immobilization of N observed at the Foothills (1,978 m) and Subalpine (3,015 m) sites suggests that these ecosystems retain N deposition. The contrast in N transformation rates between the plains and foothills, both of which receive elevated N deposition, may be due to spatial heterogeneity not captured in this study and warrants further investigation. Stream N concentrations from the subalpine to the foothills were consistently low, indicating that these soils are currently able to process and retain N deposition, but this may be disrupted if drought, wildfire, or land‐use change alter the ability of the soils to retain N."

Catlow;Junwang Tang,Methane oxidation to ethanol by a molecular junction photocatalyst,"Methane oxidation to ethanol by a molecular junction photocatalyst 
 Methane, the major component of natural and shale gas, is a significant carbon source for chemical synthesis. The direct partial oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenates under mild conditions1–3 is an attractive pathway, but the molecule’s inertness makes it challenging to achieve simultaneously high conversion and high selectivity towards a single target product. This difficulty is amplified when aiming for more valuable products that require C-C coupling4,5. While selective partial methane oxidation processes1-3,6-9 have thus typically generated C1 oxygenates6,7, recent reports have documented photocatalytic methane conversion to the C2 oxygenate ethanol with low conversions but good to high selectivities4,5,8-12. Here, we show that the intramolecular junction photocatalyst CTF-1 with alternating benzene and triazine motifs7,13 drives methane coupling and oxidation to ethanol with a high selectivity and much improved conversion. The heterojunction architecture not only enables efficient and long-lived separation of charges after their generation, but also preferential adsorption of H2O and O2 to the triazine and benzene units, respectively. This dual-site feature separates C-C coupling to form ethane intermediates from the sites where •OH radicals are formed and thereby avoids overoxidation. When loaded with Pt to boost performance further, the molecular heterojunction photocatalyst generates ethanol in a packed-bed flow reactor with improved conversion that results in an apparent quantum efficiency of 9.4%. We anticipate that further developing the “intramolecular junction” approach will deliver efficient and selective catalysts for C-C coupling, pertaining, but not limited, to methane conversion to C2+ chemicals."

 The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a >200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

 Inspired by counterintuitive water “swelling” ability of the hydrophobic moss of the genus Sphagnum (Peat moss), we prepared a hydrophobic pseudo-hydrogel (HPH), composed of a pure hydrophobic silicone elastomer with a tailored porous structure. In contrast to conventional hydrogels, HPH achieves absorption-induced volume expansion through surface tension induced elastocapillarity, presenting an unexpected absorption-induced volume expansion capability in hydrophobic matrices. We adopt a theoretical framework elucidating the interplay of surface tension induced elastocapillarity, providing insights into the absorption-induced volume expansion behavior. By systematically programming the pore structure, we demonstrate tunable, anisotropic, and programmable absorption-induced expansion. This leads to dedicated self-shaping transformations. Incorporating magnetic particles, we engineer HPH-based soft robots capable of swimming, rolling, and walking. This study demonstrates a unusual approach to achieve water-responsive behavior in hydrophobic materials, expanding the possibilities for programmable shape-morphing in soft materials and soft robotic applications.

Existing sample preparation methods are insufficient at accessing the plasma membrane and its associated proteins. Here, we present a correlative cryo-electron tomography pipeline optimally suited to image large ultra-thin areas of isolated basal and apical plasma membranes. The pipeline allows for angstrom-scale structure determination with subtomogram averaging and employs a genetically encodable rapid chemically-induced electron microscopy visible tag for marking specific proteins within the complex cellular environment. The pipeline provides efficient, distributable, low-cost sample preparation and enables targeted structural studies of identified proteins at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. Cryo-electron tomography requires thin samples. Few cell-thinning techniques have been standardized. Here, the authors provide and validate a method to prepare, label, and image proteins at mammalian cell plasma membranes for sub-nanometer structural analysis."

Here, the authors report the development of transparent wood with room temperature phosphorescence. 
 Transparent wood with high transmittance and versatility has attracted great attention as an energy-saving building material. Many studies have focused on luminescent transparent wood, while the research on organic afterglow transparent wood is an interesting combination. Here, we use luminescent difluoroboron β-diketonate (BF2bdk) compounds, methyl methacrylate (MMA), delignified wood, and initiators to prepare room-temperature phosphorescent transparent wood by thermal initiation polymerization. The resultant PMMA has been found to interact with BF2bdk via dipole-dipole interactions and consequently enhance the intersystem crossing of BF2bdk excited states. The transparent wood matrix can provide a rigid environment for BF2bdk triplets and serve as oxygen barrier to suppress non-radiative decay and oxygen quenching. The prepared afterglow material has the characteristics of diverse composition, long afterglow emission lifetimes, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. This afterglow transparent wood also demonstrates potential application value in areas such as high mechanical strength, good hydrophobicity, and high cost-effectiveness. Transparent wood has potential in building applications, and there is interest in this having additional functionality.

 The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database."
10.1038/s41612-025-00916-1,True,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science,这篇论文研究了全球气候模式(GCMs)在模拟南亚夏季风降水时出现的系统性偏差，特别是印度次大陆的干旱偏差。研究发现，GCMs模拟结果中赤道地区过多的轻微降水与印度次大陆的干旱偏差之间存在关联。高分辨率(3公里)模式比低分辨率(60公里)模式更好地模拟了印度北部地区的降水和赤道印度洋地区的轻微降水。论文认为，低分辨率模式中赤道印度洋地区过多的轻微降水导致该区域的降水和潜热增加，进而引发异常的哈德利环流，其下沉支抑制了印度北部地区的上升气流，减少了水汽输送，最终导致干旱偏差。该研究强调了在全球气候模式中控制过量轻微降水对于区域气候预测的重要性。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为对降水和水汽输送的观测需要依赖卫星观测等遥感技术。,"['monsoon rainfall', 'satellite observations', 'climate modeling', 'latent heating', 'Hadley circulation', 'moisture transport', 'precipitation']",Gudongze Li;Chun Zhao;Jun Gu;Jiawang Feng;Mingyue Xu;Xiaoyu Hao;Junshi Chen;Hong An;Wenju Cai;Tao Geng,Excessive equatorial light rain causes modeling dry bias of Indian summer monsoon rainfall,"Excessive equatorial light rain causes modeling dry bias of Indian summer monsoon rainfall 
 Simulating accurately the South Asian summer monsoon is crucial for food security of several South Asian countries yet challenging for global climate models (GCMs). The GCMs suffer from some systematic biases including dry bias in mean monsoon rainfall over the India subcontinent and excessive equatorial light rain between which the relationship was rarely discussed. Numerical experiments are conducted for one month during active monsoon with global quasi-uniform resolution of 60 km (U60 km) and 3 km (U3 km) separately. Evaluation with observations shows that U3 km reduces the dry bias over northern India and excessive light rain over the equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) that are both prominent in U60 km. Excessive light rain in U60 km contributes critically to stronger rainfall and latent heating over the EIO. A Hadley-type anomalous circulation is thus induced, whose subsidence branch suppresses updrafts and reduces moisture transport into northern India, contributing to the dry bias. The findings highlight the importance of constraining excessive light rain for regional climate projection in GCMs."

 Temporary ice roads built by the process of snow compaction, watering, and icing during cold winters are lifelines for land access in remote Arctic. In the context of the Arctic amplified warming, the vulnerability of potential ice roads under the influence of complex climate system remains unclear. Here, we construct a potential ice road assessment model that allows quantization of the climatic suitability of potential ice roads in the Arctic. Using satellite remote sensing and meteorological data, we find changes in surface air temperature and snow cover reduced the climatic suitability of potential ice roads during 1979–2017. Spatially, potential ice roads in North America face more immediate threats due to decreased snow depth compared to Eurasia. Before the end of the 21st century, we project a further decline in the climatic suitability of potential ice roads, primarily due to increasing surface air temperatures and decreasing permafrost stability. Taking precious metal/diamond exploration as an example, we conclude that mining activities associated with ice roads will face access difficulties by 2050–2100 due to the decreased potential ice roads. These results give new insights into the challenges and opportunities of Arctic overland travel. Changes in surface air temperature and snow cover between 1979-2017, particularly in North America, are reducing the climatic suitability of potential ice roads, and their contribution to land accessibility is expected to decrease by the end of the 21st century, according to model results for assessing the climatic suitability of potential Arctic ice roads using satellite remote sensing and meteorological data."

 Tropical forests may be nearing critical temperatures, yet tree species may respond differently. Using high-resolution thermal, hyperspectral, and LiDAR imagery, we mapped 652 crowns of four Hawaiian tree species to study the effects of crown traits and abiotic conditions on species’ temperatures at two scales (whole crown vs. sunlit leaves). We show scale-dependent, species-specific relationships with environmental fluctuations. Net radiation was consistently the dominant determinant of crown temperature deviations from air temperature (Tdiff), while vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, and crown traits (e.g., roughness) varied in importance by species and scale. Species explained 17% and 44% of Tdiff variation at the crown and leaf scales, respectively, after controlling for climatic factors. Findings suggest that leaf temperatures overestimate larger-scale temperature differences, while canopy-scale observations underestimate leaf heat stress. Because leaf and crown traits can have opposing effects on Tdiff, disentangling these can advance our understanding of species’ thermoregulation under climate change. Tree temperatures in tropical forests show distinct responses to external changes at leaf and crown levels, with crown temperatures being less sensitive due to canopy structure modulation, as revealed by high-resolution thermal, hyperspectral, and LiDAR imagery and field surveys of 652 trees"
