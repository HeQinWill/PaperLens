Previous studies often use a single drought index, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) or the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), while our study uses both SPI and SPEI to elucidate the effect of different drought indices on the quantification of population exposure to CDHW events. Six General Circulation Models under four future Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) are considered. Exposure is defined as the product of CDHW Magnitude (°C) and the population in each region (million people), providing a quantitative measure of how CDHW events affect populations. The role of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in CDHW population exposure projections is examined by comparing SPI, which considers only precipitation, with SPEI, which accounts for both precipitation and PET in drought measurements. Results show that after 2050, CDHW Magnitude population exposure diverges significantly across scenarios, with SSP3-7.0 exhibiting the largest increase, reaching 0.72 (SPI) and 1.78 (SPEI) million person-°C by the end of the century. Regions such as Western Africa (WAF), Southeastern Africa, and South Asia (SAS) experience the largest increases in population exposure under SSP3-7.0 with SPEI, reaching 6.93, 6.77, and 5.56 million person-°C, respectively. Additionally, regions like Western & Central Europe, the Mediterranean, WAF, Western Central Africa, Eastern Asia, and SAS display heightened sensitivity to PET, with discrepancies between SPEI and SPI projections exceeding 1 million person-°C. Attribution analysis reveals that climate change, particularly when drought is calculated using PET by SPEI, is the primary factor, followed by interaction change and population change. These findings emphasize the critical role of PET in CDHW projections and the need for region-specific adaptation strategies to manage escalating risks in highly vulnerable areas."

Corresponding to the decadal increase in TCGF, the seasonal mean anomalies of the genesis potential and environmental fields over the SCS are not favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, indicating their limited role in the decadal variation of the SCS TCGF. It is found instead that the decadal change in tropical cyclogenesis over the SCS is more attributed to the local environmental fields associated with atmospheric intraseasonal oscillation (ISO). The decadal change in SCS TCGF is closely linked to the northward extension of ISO-related convection from the central SCS, which is contributed by the horizontal advection by background monsoon flow and the vertical advection by ISO-related vertical motions. Further analyses indicate that the anomalous upper-level cyclonic circulation over East Asia and the lower-level anticyclonic circulation over the western Pacific produce unfavorable seasonal mean environmental fields in the SCS, whereas the resultant strong summer mean SCS monsoon flow facilitates the northward extension of ISO-related convection. This study highlights the importance of ISO activity for projections of long-term change in the SCS TC activity."

We assess the extent to which different types of investments in the water sector affect water quality from three perspectives (resource management, operation management, and water quality management) by implementing fixed effects, nonparametric fixed effects, and structural equation models. We introduce an innovative spatial index to account for investments in water treatment and sewage made by upstream municipalities. We use a panel dataset from 2009 to 2014 with nearly 400 observations at the provider-municipality level in Colombia with information on drinking water quality, and key variables that may influence it such as investment in water and sewage, poverty, and rurality. We show that improving resource allocation could enhance the effect of investment on water quality. Provider size also plays a role: investments made by providers with 100–450 employees show significant improvements, while other provider sizes do not. Finally, we show the need for investment in chemical, physical, and microbiological components that improve water quality."

It has a large carbon pool and acts as a major carbon sink. However, in 2023–2024, a compound heatwave-drought (CHWD) event (HD2023) hit the Amazon region, resulting in extreme temperatures and soil moisture deficits, threatening the region’s carbon sink capacity. Using advanced multisource satellite data and meteorological reanalysis, we quantified the impact of various climatic factors on vegetation productivity during HD2023 and analyzed its progression. Our findings showed that HD2023 led to a 530 Tg C decline in gross primary productivity (GPP) and 0.003 reduction in near-infrared reflectance of vegetation. The strongest phase of the event spanned 5 months, causing persistently high temperatures and reduced precipitation, leading to a continuous decline in soil moisture and marked reduction in GPP. The most severe decrease in GPP occurred in January 2024. The event originated in the northwest and gradually spread to the southeast. Soil moisture was the dominant factor in the decline of photosynthesis across vegetation types, whereas high solar radiation mitigated the impact of drought in evergreen broad forests and savannas. Moreover, the sensitivity of GPP to CHWD varied across vegetation types, ranking as grassland > savanna > evergreen broad forest. This study assessed the impact of HD2023 on regional carbon flux in the Amazon. As climate projections indicate future increases in climate extremes over the Amazon, it is important to identify the drivers of this impact on the carbon cycle of the Amazon."

Characterized by a wind speed maximum that resides at the top of the marine boundary layer, the CLLJ is largely controlled by the location and strength of the North Pacific High (NPH) as well as the coastal geometry. Considering the rich wind resource available in this offshore region, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management identified wind energy lease areas offshore California and supported the deployment of two U.S. Department of Energy wind lidar buoys near Morro Bay and Humboldt. Despite our relatively good understanding of the fundamental mechanisms responsible for large-scale CLLJ properties offshore the western U.S., future changes in CLLJ characteristics are less clear. To address this research challenge, and ultimately to better inform future wind turbine deployments, we use simulations driven by three global climate models (GCMs). We apply self-organizing maps to the model outputs for a historical and two future climate periods to show the range of NPH regimes that support CLLJ conditions during the warm seasons, as well as the subtle contribution from land-falling cyclones approaching the mainland during the cold seasons. Compared to the historical period, the three GCM-driven simulations agree that CLLJ conditions will become more (less) prevalent from central California northward (southward). They agree less with respect to future changes in maximum CLLJ wind speeds and CLLJ heights. However, after considering model biases present during the historical period, wind speeds between the models are actually more similar during the 2070–2095 period than during the historical period. The potential combination of more frequent CLLJ conditions characterized by relatively consistent wind speeds occurring at lower heights across northern California suggests that the Humboldt lease area may be ideal for a long-term wind turbine deployment."

Therefore, the extent of mitigating effect of Taiwan Island on Fujian Province-bound TCs requires investigation. Here, we classified 71 Fujian Province-bound TCs from 1984 to 2023 into two categories based on their track: Taiwan Island-crossing TCs (TCTs) and non-TCTs (nTCTs). We discovered that the duration of nTCTs was longer than TCTs, and nTCTs landing positions are more inclined to the southern Fujian Province with greater intensity as compared with TCTs. Due to the obstruction of Taiwan Island, the intensity of nTCTs with Fujian landfall was greater than that of TCTs cases. The disaster losses caused by nTCTs were significantly greater than those caused by TCTs. The number of victims, including deaths and missing people, as well as collapsed buildings, caused by nTCTs were three and two times greater than that caused by TCTs, respectively. Whether it is TCT or nTCT, the landing track and specific location determine the severity of the disaster. The damage caused by TCTs with southern tracks was more serious than that caused by TCTs with other tracks. The south -tracks caused more severe damage than north-tracks in the nTCTs category."

Updating the hydrosocial cycle to loop into stakeholders’ roles, interactions, and power dynamics","Over the years, a substantial body of knowledge has emerged to analyse the water–tourism nexus, shifting from setting agendas to problem-solving approaches, while highlighting the importance of involving stakeholders in effective governance. In this respect, the hydrosocial cycle approach has demonstrated its effectiveness in assessing the human–nature dimension of water resources by examining the roles and narratives of stakeholders, as well as the asymmetrical power dynamics influencing decision-making processes. This study establishes a framework aimed at enhancing governance in hydrosocial research related to the intersection of water and tourism by exploring stakeholders’ interactions across five key dimensions: relevance, representativeness, recognition, performance, and collaboration. Additionally, it articulates each dimension using a triple-loop factor scheme that considers stakeholders’ knowledge (to be), actions (to do), and relationships (to share). This framework was implemented in two Mediterranean coastal hotspots, Benidorm (Spain) and Rimini (Italy), which exemplify complex water management contexts marked by competing water needs. Data were gathered through questionnaires distributed to key stakeholders, such as municipalities, regional authorities, water suppliers, irrigation districts, and tourism associations. Our findings illustrate that within the water–tourism nexus, governance tends to favour the water component over the tourism dimension, as evidenced by water stakeholders’ leadership roles, player status, and their greater relevance and recognition in terms of their responsibilities and actions. Moreover, although some stakeholders lack awareness of others’ roles within the system, no stakeholder was seen as redundant, which suggests potential for fostering engagement by pinpointing most influential stakeholders and reassessing their positions in power-imbalanced contexts. The proposed framework introduces a straightforward, flexible, and easily replicable strategy for dealing with context-dependent issues and challenges, such as the water–tourism nexus, and can enhance the effectiveness of broader participatory tools, such as semi-structured interviews and workshops, improving its applicability in a range of governance environments."

We show that satellite remote sensing data can effectively constrain these parameters, enabling us to produce the first global maps of ozone production rates with unprecedented resolution. 
 Ozone pollution is secondarily produced through a complex, non-linear chemical process. Our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations in photochemically produced ozone (i.e., PO3) is limited to sparse aircraft campaigns and chemical transport models, which often carry significant biases. Hence, we present a novel satellite-derived PO3 product informed by bias-corrected TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO, NO2, surface albedo data, and various models. These data are integrated into a parameterization that relies on HCHO, NO2, HCHO / NO2, jNO2, and jO1D. Despite its simplicity, it can reproduce ∼ 90 % of the variance in observationally constrained PO3, with minimal biases in moderately to highly polluted regions. We map PO3 across various regions with respect to July 2019 at a 0.1° × 0.1° spatial resolution, revealing accelerated values (> 8 ppbv h−1) for numerous cities throughout Asia and the Middle East, resulting from elevated ozone precursors and enhanced photochemistry. In Europe and the United States, such high levels are only detected over Benelux, Los Angeles, and New York City. PO3 maxima are observed in various seasons and are attributed to changes in photolysis rates, non-linear ozone chemistry, and fluctuations in HCHO and NO2. Satellite errors result in moderate errors (10 %–20 %) in PO3 estimates over cities on a monthly average basis, while these errors exceed 50 % in clean areas and under low light conditions. Using the current algorithm, we demonstrate that satellite data can provide valuable information for robust PO3 estimation. This capability expands future research through the application of data to address significant scientific questions about locally produced ozone hotspots, seasonality, and long-term trends."

Young leaves play a key role in this process, but their efficiency has been difficult to measure at large scales. Using satellite data, we developed a new method to track the seasonal patterns of young leaves’ photosynthetic capacity from 2001 to 2018. Our dataset helps scientists better understand forest growth and how ecosystems respond to climate change. 
 Determining the large-scale Rubisco carboxylation maximum rate (Vc,max25) in relation to leaf age is crucial for assessing the photosynthetic capacity of canopy leaves in global forests. Young leaves (≤180 days) with higher Vc,max25 compared with old leaves (>180 days) largely control the seasonality of leaf photosynthetic capacity in tropical and subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests (TEFs). Nevertheless, it has not yet been adequately quantified across TEFs. In this study, we propose an innovative method that leverages neighborhood pixel analysis with a nonlinear least squares fitting approach to derive the Vc,max25 of the young leaves at 0.25° spatial resolution from satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) products spanning from 2001 to 2018, which were reconstructed using both the TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) SIF and MODIS reflectance data (RTSIF). Validations against in situ observations show that the newly developed Vc,max25 products accurately capture the seasonality of the young leaf area in South America and subtropical Asia, with correlation coefficients equal to 0.837, 0.661, and 0.952, respectively. Additionally, the Vc,max25 of the young leaves simulated from the RTSIF is effectively correlated (R>0.512) with that dissolved from the gridded gross primary production (GOSIF-derived GPP). Furthermore, the gridded young leaf Vc,max25 dataset effectively detects the green-up region during the dry seasons in the tropics, where the average annual precipitation exceeds 2000 mm/year. The clustering patterns of the young leaf Vc,max25 also effectively match those clustered by climatic variables across the TEFs. Overall, the newly developed Vc,max25 product is the first satellite-based dataset for addressing the Vc,max25 of photosynthetically efficient young leaves and can provide useful information for modeling the large-scale photosynthesis dynamics and thus carbon cycle across the TEFs. Herein, we provide the time series of Vc,max25 derived from RTSIF GPP as the main dataset and GOSIF- and FLUXCOM- derived as supplementary datasets.

 Modern pollen datasets can provide invaluable data for interpreting temporal variations in climate, vegetation, land cover, and plant diversity from fossil pollen. Here we present 555 pollen count data, identified from topsoil collected within plant plots across a vast area of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and along the southern margin of Xinjiang that borders the TP. This dataset fills a geographical gap in the published datasets that offer pollen count data for this area. Ordination analysis and multiple regression reveal that precipitation is the primary factor influencing the spatial distribution of pollen assemblages across the entire study area. Furthermore, ordination analysis indicates that pollen assemblages can be used to distinguish vegetation types in the southeastern TP, such as coniferous forest, alpine shrubland, and alpine meadow, from vegetation types found in other regions of TP. Additionally, it is possible to distinguish vegetation types that have low precipitation or moisture requirements based on pollen assemblages. Generalized additive models demonstrate that six commonly used pollen ratios, involving taxa such as Artemisia, Amaranthaceae, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae, are not sufficiently reliable for reflecting changes in annual precipitation. Nevertheless, they can provide some indication of changes in vegetation or landscape. This dataset holds various potential applications in paleoecological and paleoclimatic researches. It not only offers a scientific foundation for reconstructing changes in climate and vegetation over time, but also enables the assessment of the reliability of pollen assemblages in representing the dynamics of vegetation cover, functional traits, and plant diversity, by integrating the simultaneously measured plot-level plant communities and functional traits.

Evidently, it is not enough to use more computing units of the conventionally used architectures; higher memory throughput is the most promising approach. More potential can be gained from single-node optimization rather than simply increasing the number of compute nodes. 
 The weather and climate model ICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) is being used in high-resolution climate simulations, in order to resolve small-scale physical processes. The envisaged performance for this task is 1 simulated year per day for a coupled atmosphere–ocean setup at global 1.2 km resolution. The necessary computing power for such simulations can only be found on exascale supercomputing systems. The main question we try to answer in this article is where to find sustained exascale performance, i.e. which hardware (processor type) is best suited for the weather and climate model ICON, and consequently how this performance can be exploited by the model, i.e. what changes are required in ICON's software design so as to utilize exascale platforms efficiently.  To this end, we present an overview of the available hardware technologies and a quantitative analysis of the key performance indicators of the ICON model on several architectures. It becomes clear that parallelization based on the decomposition of the spatial domain has reached the scaling limits, leading us to conclude that the performance of a single node is crucial to achieve both better performance and better energy efficiency. Furthermore, based on the computational intensity of the examined kernels of the model it is shown that architectures with higher memory throughput are better suited than those with high computational peak performance. From a software engineering perspective, a redesign of ICON from a monolithic to a modular approach is required to address the complexity caused by hardware heterogeneity and new programming models to make ICON suitable for running on such machines."

To better understand climate impacts of forest bioenergy use, we develop a comprehensive framework for assessing the dynamic lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for bioenergy projects using pine pulpwood feedstocks from managed forests in the U.S. South. We apply it in eight different forest basins to determine the carbon payback period and cumulative carbon storage for hypothetical bioenergy projects with 30-year plant operating lives (2030–2060). Variations in local forest types, age class distributions, and traditional wood product market demands result in large differences in carbon payback times between basins. In general, carbon debt repayment is faster for biofuel or bioelectricity projects that employ CCS than those that do not. We find that facilities employing CCS and consuming 3 million green tons of feedstock annually yield carbon payback periods below 10 years if located within pine-dominated coastal plain or gulf coast regions. In a hardwood-dominated basin such as in Virginia, carbon payback is not achieved."

However, understanding of how anthropogenic freshwater withdrawals perturb land-freshwater-ocean and freshwater-atmosphere inorganic carbon fluxes is limited. Using the United States (US) as an exemplar, we estimate that fresh surface water withdrawals across the country during the year 2015 resulted in a median gross dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) retention flux of 8.2 (uncertainty range: 6.7–9.9) Tg C yr–1, equivalent to 28.3% of the total export of DIC to the oceans from US rivers. The median gross retention flux due to fresh groundwater withdrawals was 6.9 (uncertainty range: 5.3–8.8) Tg C yr–1, over eight times the magnitude of the DIC flux to the oceans by US subterranean groundwater discharge. The degassing of CO2 supersaturated groundwater following withdrawal emitted 3.6 (uncertainty range: 2.2–5.5) Tg of CO2 yr–1, 112% larger than previous estimates. On a county level, these CO2 emissions exceeded CO2 emissions from major emitting facilities across 45% of US counties.

One potential risk of wildfire smoke exposure is the impairment that it may cause to lung macrophages, which serve as the first line of defense against inhaled pathogens and particles. Size-fractionated wildfire particulate matter (WFPM) collected in the New Jersey/New York metropolitan area during the June 2023 Canadian wildfire event was used to assess the effect on the health and function of THP-1 lung macrophages. Environmentally relevant in vitro WFPM doses were determined using established in vivo and in vitro dosimetry models. Exposure to WFPM0.1–2.5 (0.1–2.5 μm) for 24 h caused a significant (∼15%) increase in reactive oxygen species, indicating oxidative stress. More importantly, exposure to either WFPM0.1 (≤0.1 μm) or WFPM0.1–2.5 significantly reduced THP-1 lung macrophage viability. Additionally, 24 h exposure to either of the WFPM fractions reduced phagocytosis of unopsonized 1 μm polystyrene beads by approximately 50%, which appeared to be due to a defect in binding, which could in turn be a result of scavenger receptor blockade by WFPM or diminished viability and thus ATP depletion, depriving the macrophages of energy required to perform phagocytosis. Together, these findings suggest that WFPM exposure could impair lung macrophage health and function, which could increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. Further mechanistic in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to better understand the impacts of WFPM on lung innate immunity and the risk of pulmonary infection."

During seasonal destratification, large, short-lived pulses of aqueous MeHg may be released into the subsequently mixed water column, but little is known about the fate of these pulses, particularly whether there are concomitant increases in MeHg uptake into aquatic food webs. We examined the magnitude and timing of MeHg uptake across several trophic guilds relative to the reservoir stratification status using biweekly mercury data from water, zooplankton, and fish (Bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus and Smallmouth Bass, Micropterus dolomieu). Zooplankton MeHg concentrations increased by up to 250% during destratification, concurrent with increases in aqueous MeHg concentrations. Zooplankton and filter-passing MeHg concentrations were positively correlated when the reservoir was mixed (R2 = 0.95) and destratifying (R2 = 0.57) but not while the reservoir was stratified (R2 = 0.21). Mercury concentrations in adult bluegill and juveniles of both fish species increased 20–70% following destratification, with responses lagging 4–8 weeks behind those in water and zooplankton MeHg. Mercury concentrations in piscivorous adult bass varied little over the course of the study. Our findings demonstrate the responsiveness of reservoir food webs to pulses in MeHg availability, suggesting that these pulses could play an important role in biotic MeHg exposure within and downstream of reservoirs."

This has prompted a need for life cycle assessment (LCA) models to predict their terrestrial comparative toxicity potential (CTP) and impact score. We compared the LCA (reference method) prediction ability with that obtained with an experimental data set obtained from a month-long incubation experiment (experimental method) on a soil amended or not with 31 livestock effluents mimicking agronomically relevant scenarios. The impact scores for Cu and Zn differed between the reference and experimental methods due to CTP discrepancies between the two methods. The application of 31 livestock effluents on the soil resulted in variability in the experimentally determined CTP for Zn and Cu (0.6 and 1.9 log10 units) comparable to the CTP variability estimated by the reference method for several hundred worldwide soils. These results could be explained by the inadequate prediction of the dissolved organic carbon concentration and Cu and Zn concentration and speciation in soil solution. We propose refinements to the multilinear regressions used for the CTP computation that take the soil property patterns following livestock effluent application on soils into account."

However, fundamental questions regarding their formation and prevalence remain unanswered. Here, we endeavor to answer how congestus cloud tops form by detraining preferentially at altitudes between 5 and 6 km and why this detraining outflow is invigorated by drier mid‐tropospheric conditions. We construct a clear‐sky radiative‐convective framework of congestus cloud‐top formation that is grounded in the discovery of an important spectroscopic property of water vapor. In this mass‐ and energy‐conserving framework, convective detrainment maximizes at a height of 5 and 6 km due to a swift decline in radiative cooling in clear‐sky regions. This decline is, in turn, a consequence of water vapor spectroscopy: more specifically, a drop in the number of strong absorption lines in the water vapor rotation band. In a simple spectral model, we link this spectroscopic property to the shape of the rotation band, which can be approximated as the product of a power law and a sine wave representing the band's deviation from statistical log‐linearity. The characteristic “C”‐shaped relative humidity profile in the tropics further strengthens the outflow in drier mid‐level conditions by amplifying vertical decreases in the clear‐sky cooling rate. Essential to this process are strong RH gradients, which are most pronounced under the driest conditions and induce a vertical decrease in the optical depth lapse rate across the mid‐troposphere."

Differences in tropical sea surface temperature (SST) trends can only partially explain the discrepancy in jet trends between models and observations and a small minority of simulations forced with observed SSTs match the magnitude of the observed jet trend. However, analysis of longer‐term jet variability in reanalysis suggests that the jet trend has not clearly emerged from multi‐decadal internal climate variability. Consequently, it is unclear whether the difference in observed and modeled jet trends arises due to differing responses to anthropogenic forcing or overly weak long‐term internal variability in models.

To quantify the impact of vegetation greenness change on drought across global vegetation zones, this study conducted two simulations with and without linear trends in the Leaf Area Index (LAI), based on the Standardized Precipitation‐Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) combined with the calibrated Shuttleworth‐Wallace potential evapotranspiration (PET) equation. Results revealed vegetation greening affected 71% of areas, and over 55% of areas experienced increases in PET, decreases in SPEI (indicating drying), and intensified drought conditions. The linear trends in LAI increased potential transpiration but decreased potential soil evaporation in most regions. The changes in drought are determined by the combined effects of these changes in potential transpiration and soil evaporation.

This study comprehensively investigated the carbonate chemistry, sediment carbon content, mineral composition, and benthic alkalinity fluxes in two distinct sites with tropical seagrass meadows: one situated in organic carbon (OC)‐rich reef sediments and the other in OC‐poor terrestrial sediments. Results showed nearly two orders of magnitude higher benthic alkalinity fluxes in the OC‐rich reefs than in OC‐poor sediments (72.8 ± 64.4 vs. 0.53 ± 0.99 mmol m−2 d−1). This can further substantially increase alkalinity levels and reduce the partial pressure of CO2 in the overlying seawater, thereby enhancing the capacity for CO2 uptake.

To address this, we modified the algorithm to set negative weights to zero and compared the performance with the original algorithm. Our findings indicate that setting negative weights to zero results in a slight improvement in blending performance compared to using negative weights directly. This improvement may be attributed to modeling the actual forecast error as a normally distributed unified parameter and applying a consistent correlation coefficient across the annual data set."

Long term static pressure measurements above a sub‐arctic forested canopy for near‐neutral conditions during the winter and spring were collected and analyzed for three snow cover conditions: trees and ground covered with snow, trees are snow free but the ground is covered with snow, and snow free cover. In all three cases, it is shown that Eppkx ${E}_{pp}\left({k}_{x}\right)$ obeys the attached eddy hypothesis at low wavenumbers 1/δ<kx<1/z $\left(1/\delta <  {k}_{x}<  1/z\right)$—with Eppkx∝u∗4kx−1 ${E}_{pp}\left({k}_{x}\right)\propto {u}_{\ast }^{4}{k}_{x}^{-1}$ and Kolmogorov scaling in the inertial subrange at higher wavenumbers—with Eppkx∝ϵ4/3kx−7/3 ${E}_{pp}\left({k}_{x}\right)\propto {{\epsilon}}^{4/3}{k}_{x}^{-7/3}$, where u∗ ${u}_{\ast }$ is the friction velocity at the canopy top, ϵ ${\epsilon}$ is the mean turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, z $z$ is the distance from the snow top, and δ $\delta $ is the boundary layer depth.

Using composite analysis, we find that there is significant warming along the coastal region of Southern California preceding a TC, particularly for storms that remain offshore. Three main mechanisms contribute to this warming pattern—adiabatic compression associated with downslope winds, warm air advection by the TC itself, and suppression of coastal upwelling.

In idealized numerical studies of TCs, a two‐stage mode of RI is frequently observed. However, the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain unclear. This study examines the physics of the second RI phase from the perspective of TC internal dynamics. It is revealed that the formation and maintenance of outer rainbands inhibit the development of inner rainbands, resulting in a more upright and compact heating structure within the inner core of the TC. This change in heating structure results in an intensification and inward movement of negative heating gradient that effectively enhances the boundary layer (BL) inflow within the radius of maximum wind (RMW), leading to a rapid increase in the inward flux of vorticity and ultimately contributing to the second phase of RI. This study highlights the significance of rainband interactions in the two‐stage RI process of TCs, suggesting that enhancing our understanding and characterization of rainband interactions hold promise for key progress in TC intensity estimation and prediction."

Among these challenges, competition for land between large‐scale renewable energy production plants and agriculture poses a risk, especially for photovoltaics. Agrivoltaics offers an opportunity to synergistically use land for simultaneous production of energy and food. Recent studies have investigated the upscaling potential of agrivoltaics, moving from field scale analyses to larger‐scale suitability assessments. Yet, studies addressing the interaction between crop dynamics and local climatic factors, as well as explicitly investigating hydrological dynamics of agrivoltaics across crops and climates, are still limited. Here, we first superpose a spatial data set of existing photovoltaic farms with different land use/land cover maps to assess the magnitude of land use competition associated with photovoltaics. Then, we use a spatialized agro‐hydrological model to simulate the response to different levels of radiation attenuation of 22 non‐irrigated crops in their harvested areas across the globe. We find that 22%–35% of rainfed harvested areas globally would maintain their yields if converted to agrivoltaics, while 13%–16% of ground‐mounted photovoltaic plants globally are associated with a cropland to non‐cropland transition. While carrying the typical limitations and uncertainties of global studies, our results may offer novel possibilities for cross‐crop and cross‐location comparisons of agrivoltaic experiences, as well as a basis to have a deeper and cross‐scale understanding of the feasibility of photovoltaics."

We analyzed 2,322 AMI patients admitted to 103 US hospitals (2008–2012). Daily maximum 8‐hr O3 concentrations estimated using a spatiotemporal deep learning approach were assigned to participants' home addresses. We used a time‐stratified case‐crossover design with conditional logistic regression to assess the association between O3 and AMI, adjusting for fine particulate matter, air temperature, and relative humidity. We conducted stratified analyses to examine associations for AMI subtypes and effect modification by sociodemographic status, lifestyle factors, and medical history. An interquartile range (16.6 ppb) increase in O3 concentrations was associated with an increased AMI risk at lag 4 days (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08–1.34) and lag 5 days (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.00–1.24).

Stronger O3‐AMI associations were observed in non‐Hispanic Blacks than in non‐Hispanic Whites. Our study provides evidence that short‐term O3 exposure is associated with increased AMI risk in younger patients, with varying associations across AMI subtypes.

 Ultra-hot Jupiters, an extreme class of planets not found in our solar system, provide a unique window into atmospheric processes. The extreme temperature contrasts between their day- and night-sides pose a fundamental climate puzzle: how is energy distributed? To address this, we must observe the 3D structure of these atmospheres, particularly their vertical circulation patterns, which can serve as a testbed for advanced Global Circulation Models (GCM) e.g.1. Here we show a dramatic shift in atmospheric circulation in an ultra-hot Jupiter: a unilateral flow from the hot star- facing side to the cooler space-facing side of the planet sits below an equatorial super-rotational jet stream. By resolving the vertical structure of atmospheric dynamics, we move beyond integrated global snapshots of the atmosphere, enabling more accurate identification of flow patterns and allowing for a more nuanced comparison to models. Global Circulation Models based on first principles struggle to replicate the observed circulation pattern3 underscoring a critical gap between theoretical understanding of atmospheric flows and observational evidence.

 Over the last deglaciation, global sea level rose by ~120–130 m, 10–20 m of which was attributed to a singular, catastrophic event known as Meltwater Pulse 1A (MWP-1A) that spanned at most 500 years approximately 14.6 kyr ago. Given data limitations and simplified models of Earth deformation, previous studies have struggled to determine the ice sources responsible for MWP-1A, its timing and, consequently, the impacts on global climate. With the expansion of palaeo sea-level records and growing consensus that more complex Earth deformation occurs over MWP-1A timescales, revisiting MWP-1A is timely. Here we resolve a sequence of ice loss over MWP-1A using a spatiotemporal sea-level fingerprinting approach constrained by temporal variations across sea-level data that fully models transient viscoelastic deformation, resulting in a space–time melt evolution. Our favoured sequence of ice sheet melting begins with the Laurentide contributing ~3 m (~14.6–14.2 kyr ago), followed by Eurasia and West Antarctica contributing ~7 m and ~5 m, respectively (~14.35–14.2 kyr ago). This scenario is consistent with proxy data that suggest a minimal Laurentide contribution and large retreat of the Eurasian Ice Sheet Complex. Our MWP-1A ice evolution demands the revision of global ice histories and illustrates deformation feedbacks that are relevant for modern ice collapse and sea-level rise.

This study uncovers the structure and function of a critical enzyme involved in their production and breakdown, revealing how cells control inositol pyrophosphate levels to regulate nutrient signaling. 
 Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are eukaryotic nutrient messengers. The N-terminal kinase domain of diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase (PPIP5K) generates the messenger 1,5-InsP8, the C-terminal phosphatase domain catalyzes PP-InsP breakdown. The balance between kinase and phosphatase activities regulates 1,5-InsP8 levels. Here, we present crystal structures of the apo and substrate-bound PPIP5K phosphatase domain from S. cerevisiae (ScVip1PD). ScVip1PD is a phytase-like inositol 1-pyrophosphate histidine phosphatase with two conserved catalytic motifs. The enzyme has a strong preference for 1,5-InsP8 and is inhibited by inorganic phosphate. It contains an α-helical insertion domain stabilized by a structural Zn2+ binding site, and a unique GAF domain that channels the substrate to the active site. Mutations that alter the active site, restrict the movement of the GAF domain, or change the substrate channel’s charge inhibit the enzyme activity in vitro, and Arabidopsis VIH2 in planta.

Here, Sun et al. use a genome-wide approach to identify variants of IDO2 associated with depression in individuals who have undergone child maltreatment. 
 Childhood maltreatment stands out as a pivotal risk factor for depression, with gene-by-environment interaction serving as a crucial mechanism. Here we perform genome-wide interaction analyzes of childhood maltreatment in the UK Biobank, integrating methylation evidence through colocalization analysis and identifying associated brain structure abnormalities from childhood to adulthood. A genome-wide significant genomic region interacting with childhood maltreatment is identified at 8p11.21 (IDO2 rs7846217, P = 2.02e–08), implicating the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway. Colocalization analysis reveals that IDO2 rs11777027, rs2340953 and rs28631334 are associated with depression in individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment and colocalize with methylation signals in both blood and brain for IDO2. These interactions affect cortical thickness of the left supramarginal gyrus in children (P = 9.72e–04) and adults (P = 1.34e–04), as well as cortical volume in the right angular gyrus in children (P = 1.02e–04). Furthermore, the interactions significantly predict new-onset depression at a 2-year follow-up in children. Stunted increase in cortical thickness of the left middle-anterior cingulate gyrus and sulcus significantly mediates the interaction between childhood maltreatment and IDO2 on childhood depression.

Here, the authors employ structure-based docking screens of vast fragment libraries to identify inhibitors of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, a difficult drug target implicated in cancer and inflammation. 
 Fragment-based screening can catalyze drug discovery by identifying novel scaffolds, but this approach is limited by the small chemical libraries studied by biophysical experiments and the challenging optimization process. To expand the explored chemical space, we employ structure-based docking to evaluate orders-of-magnitude larger libraries than those used in traditional fragment screening. We computationally dock a set of 14 million fragments to 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), a difficult drug target involved in cancer and inflammation, and evaluate 29 highly ranked compounds experimentally. Four of these bind to OGG1 and X-ray crystallography confirms the binding modes predicted by docking. Furthermore, we show how fragment elaboration using searches among billions of readily synthesizable compounds identifies submicromolar inhibitors with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects in cells. Comparisons of virtual screening strategies to explore a chemical space of 1022 compounds illustrate that fragment-based design enables enumeration of all molecules relevant for inhibitor discovery. Virtual fragment screening is hence a highly efficient strategy for navigating the rapidly growing combinatorial libraries and can serve as a powerful tool to accelerate drug discovery efforts for challenging therapeutic targets.

Here, the authors show that upregulation of the FOSL1 transcription factor restores YAP/TEAD occupancy on chromatin to drive resistance to GNE-7883, an allosteric TEAD inhibitor. 
 TEAD (transcriptional enhanced associate domain) transcription factors (TEAD1-4) serve as the primary effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway in various cancers. Targeted therapy leads to the emergence of resistance and the underlying mechanism of resistance to TEAD inhibition in cancers is less characterized. We uncover that upregulation of the AP-1 (activator protein-1) transcription factors, along with restored YAP (yes-associated protein) and TEAD activity, drives resistance to GNE-7883, a pan-TEAD inhibitor. Acute GNE-7883 treatment abrogates YAP-TEAD binding and attenuates FOSL1 (FOS like 1) activity. TEAD inhibitor resistant cells restore YAP and TEAD chromatin occupancy, acquire additional FOSL1 binding and exhibit increased MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway activity. FOSL1 is required for the chromatin binding of YAP and TEAD. This study describes a clinically relevant interplay between the Hippo and MAPK pathway and highlights the key role of MAPK pathway inhibitors in mitigating resistance to TEAD inhibition in Hippo pathway dependent cancers.

 The genetic bases of mosaic pigmentation disorders have increasingly been identified, but these conditions remain poorly characterised, and their pathophysiology is unclear. Here, we report in four unrelated patients that a recurrent postzygotic mutation in GNA13 is responsible for a recognizable syndrome with hypomelanosis of Ito associated with developmental anomalies. GNA13 encodes Gα13, a subunit of αβγ heterotrimeric G proteins coupled to specific transmembrane receptors known as G-protein coupled receptors. In-depth functional investigations revealed that this R200K mutation provides a gain of function to Gα13. Mechanistically, we show that this variant hyperactivates the RHOA/ROCK signalling pathway that consequently increases actin polymerisation and myosin light chains phosphorylation, and promotes melanocytes rounding. Our results also indicate that R200K Gα13 hyperactivates the YAP signalling pathway. All these changes appear to affect cell migration and adhesion but not the proliferation. Our results suggest that hypopigmentation can result from a defect in melanosome transfer to keratinocytes due to cell shape alterations. These findings highlight the interaction between heterotrimeric G proteins and the RHOA pathway, and their role in melanocyte function.

Here, the authors use an emergent constraint to show that the tropical Hadley circulation is weakening more intensely than previously thought, resulting in stronger precipitation increases in subtropical regions. 
 Accurately assessing future precipitation changes presents one of the greatest challenges of climate change. In the tropics, changes in the Hadley circulation are expected to considerably affect precipitation in dry subtropical and wet equatorial regions. However, while climate models project a robust weakening of the Northern Hemisphere circulation in the coming decades, currently, there is low confidence in the magnitude of such weakening and its impact on regional precipitation patterns. Here we use emergent constraint analyses and observation-based Hadley circulation strength changes to show that the projected circulation weakening will probably be larger than in current predictions. The more pronounced weakening of the flow results in a doubling of the subtropical precipitation increase compared with current forecasts, specifically over Asia, Africa and the Pacific Ocean. Our findings provide more accurate tropical circulation and precipitation projections and have considerable societal impacts, given the scarcity of water in subtropical regions. The degree to which the tropical circulation changes with warming is not well known.

 Eurasian teleconnections in boreal summer significantly influence regional climates and extremes, yet their dynamic origins remain largely unclear. Here, we revealed two critical modes of tropical convection that drive these Eurasian teleconnections in boreal summer. The first mode is characterized by suppressed convection in the equatorial eastern Pacific, coupled with enhanced convection extending from the equatorial Atlantic to northern Africa. In contrast, the second mode displays similar suppressed convection in the equatorial eastern Pacific, but features enhanced convection in the Gulf of Mexico and the equatorial Atlantic. These two modes result in markedly different atmospheric teleconnections, leading to distinct surface air temperature anomalies across the Eurasian continent. Both modes arise from the combined effects of sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern Pacific and the North Atlantic/Indian Ocean.

 Severe urban air pollution in China is driven by a synergistic conversion of SO2, NOx, and NH3 into fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Field studies indicated NO2 as an important oxidizer to SO2 in polluted atmospheres with low photochemical reactivity, but this rapid reaction cannot be explained by the aqueous reactive nitrogen chemistry in acidic urban aerosols. Here, using an aerosol optical tweezer and Raman spectroscopy, we show that the multiphase SO2 oxidation by NO2 is accelerated for two-order-of-magnitude by a copper catalyst. This reaction occurs on aerosol surfaces, is independent of pH between 3 and 5, and produces sulfate by a rate of up to 10 µg m-3air hr-1 when reactive copper reaches a millimolar concentration in aerosol water – typical of severe haze events in North China Plain.

 Global warming is accelerating climate disasters by triggering tipping points in various Earth systems. Although changes in precipitation patterns in High-Mountain Asia (HMA) have been extensively studied, the specific thresholds that trigger rapid snowfall loss remain unclear. A continuous piecewise linear regression model was employed to classify HMA into four distinct precipitation regimes: insensitive snowfall-dominated areas, sensitive snowfall-dominated areas, sensitive rainfall-dominated areas, and insensitive rainfall-dominated areas. Our results show that future warming will increase the sensitivity of winter and spring snowfall to climate change, whereas summer and autumn snowfall will become less sensitive. All four precipitation regimes exhibit an upward shift to higher elevations, with varying rates of elevation gain across regions and seasons. Temperature is the primary driver of snowfall loss, whereas relative humidity mitigates it.

 Previous studies focused on the spatial diversity of ENSO’s influence on tropical cyclones (TCs) in the western North Pacific (WNP), with less emphasis on temporal evolution. This study examines the variability of TC genesis in the WNP during boreal autumn (September-November) across three types of La Niña transitions: cyclic, multi-year, and episodic. The findings highlight significant differences, particularly in the South China Sea’s (SCS) role within the WNP region. During a cyclic La Niña, the SCS TC frequency is approximately 2.6 times greater than those of the other two types due to higher local humidity from increased water vapor transport from the Indian Ocean and convergence in the SCS, driven by an anomalous cyclone in the SCS and Maritime Continent. Observations and model simulations revealed that a warmer sea surface temperature in the Philippine Sea, a delayed effect of the preceding El Niño, triggered this cyclonic circulation and moisture influx."

Our findings indicate atmospheric forcing as the primary driver of marine heatwave onsets in the northeast and southwest, while horizontal advection plays a key role in the southeast and northwest coasts. While the frequency and associated temperature changes of the events’ main drivers are subject to regional influences, the intensity and duration of extreme warming due to horizontal advection, on average, exceed that of atmosphere heat fluxes, which act as the major cooling mechanism across the majority of study areas. Ecological threats for Red Sea corals are further highlighted with a view to enhance our understanding of their response to climate change. Atmospheric forcing governs summer marine heatwave onsets in the northeast and southwest Red Sea, whereas horizontal advection is key in the southeast and northwest, according to high-resolution ocean model simulations."

 Solar farms play an integral role in the global energy transition and climate change mitigation. However, criticism has emerged, arguing that mitigating climate change cannot come at the expense of ecosystem degradation due to an ambiguous understanding of solar farms’ environmental impacts. Here we developed a harmonic regression model to conduct a nuanced global analysis of solar farms’ influences on vegetation. Results show that 52% of solar farms exhibited beneficial effects on vegetation coverage, with the highest enhancement (136.72%) found in regions where the aridity index is 0.39. However, changes in coverage are not triggered solely by solar farms; rather, there is a counterbalance between the contributions from climate change and from solar farms, implying that observed coverage changes could be stalled or even reversed in the future. Furthermore, plant functional type transition is an additional potential driver. Our findings could improve solar farm site selection and policies.

 Carbon removal and emission reductions simultaneously play a decisive role in carbon neutrality. Yet, different from the structural upgrades in emission reduction, carbon removal through afforestation often heavily relies on specific geographical space. Although carbon neutrality pathways that overlook spatial details play a significant role, the challenge of spatiotemporal equilibrium linked with carbon neutrality exacerbates the economic risks of joint abatement by both parties. Here, we assessed cost-optimal pathways for afforestation in China up to 2060 by incorporating marginal abatement cost curves derived from spatial decomposition of afforestation into a dynamic multi-model analysis of joint abatement. Our findings reveal that afforestation needs to play an increasingly important role in climate mitigation from 2020 to 2060, while the share of emissions reduction needs to gradually decrease. Afforestation policies and actions under carbon neutrality should be coordinated with emissions reduction efforts, aiming to achieve cost-optimal joint abatement, which can be an important source of climate mitigation efforts and address the financial challenges of carbon neutrality. Moreover, the intertemporal cost-optimal maps to carbon neutrality through afforestation observed significant spatiotemporal variability of cost-optimal areas. Hence, focusing afforestation efforts on cost-optimal areas during specific periods can be another important way of addressing the financial challenges.

 In tropical montane forests, the Earth’s largest biodiversity hotspots, there is increasing evidence that climate warming is resulting in montane species being displaced by their lowland counterparts. However, the drivers of these changes are poorly understood. Across a large elevation gradient in the Colombian Andes, we established three experimental plantations of 15 dominant tree species including both naturally occurring montane and lowland species and measured their survival and growth. Here we show that 55% of the studied montane species maintained growth at their survival’s hottest temperature with the remaining 45% being intolerant to such levels of warming, declining their growth, while lowland species benefited strongly from the warmest temperatures. Our findings suggest that the direct negative effects of warming and increased competition of montane species with lowland species are promoting increased homogeneity in community composition, resulting in reduced biodiversity.

Zhang;Yu Shen;Yongchang Ye;Yuxia Liu;Shuai Gao;Shuai An,A transformer-based model for detecting land surface phenology from the irregular harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series across the United States,"•A Transformer-based model enables to handle time series with missing data. •The model is well trained with spatially matched high-quality phenology reference. •The model detects 30 m phenometrics with raw HLS time series across the US. •The model outperforms the traditional method in phenology detections across regions. 
 Land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely generated using traditional methods of fitting satellite-based time series of vegetation indices over the past two decades. However, these methods are highly vulnerable to the presence of temporal gaps and the use of specific smoothing or gap-filling algorithms. Several attempts have recently used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to detect phenology, which produce an uncertainty of larger than three weeks and as large as two months. Further, these deep learning methods cannot handle missing data in time series and still need temporal gap-filling, which results in low to moderate accuracy in phenology detection. This study proposed a novel Transformer-based model to detect 30 m phenological events across the United States for the years 2019 and 2020. Specifically, we adapted the Transformer architecture to handle irregular time series and capture long-range relationships among all high-quality observations in the satellite time series. The Transformer-based model was trained using reference time series samples extracted from the high-quality LSP product, which was recently produced by fusing the HLS (Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2) observations with near-surface PhenoCam time series (HLS-PhenoCam LSP). The accuracy of the Transformer-based model for LSP detection using the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) was investigated and compared with the most widely used Hybrid Piecewise Logistic Model based Land Surface Phenology Detection (HPLM-LSPD) algorithm and one dimensional (1D) CNN model. The phenological patterns detected from the Transformer-based model and the HPLM-LSPD algorithm were mostly comparable, despite the occasional differences in magnitude and local details when compared to the reference HLS-PhenoCam LSP product. The accuracy metrics indicated that the Transformer-based model produced overall higher accuracy than the HPLM-LSPD algorithm and the 1D-CNN model, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.74–0.88, a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 9.6–15 days, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 13.5–20.6 days, and a mean systematic bias (MSB) of 0.7–4.7 days. The statistical analyses also showed that the Transformer-based model outperformed the HPLM-LSPD algorithm across all vegetation types and the HLS time series with different numbers of high-quality observations. Further, the accuracy of the Transformer-based model is contingent upon the proportion of high-quality observations. The model could achieve consistently high accuracy if the high-quality observations exceed 25 %. This study paved an effective way from traditional methodologies to machine learning methods for detecting phenological transition dates of vegetation development across various ecosystems."

 NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Clouds, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, launched on 8th February 2024, carries a hyperspectral radiometer, Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) and two multi-angle polarimeters, Hyper Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP2) and Spectro-Polarimeter for Planetary Exploration one (SPEX-one). The simultaneous deployment of these sensors offers an unprecedented opportunity to derive more accurate bidirectional factors for correcting the Sun-sensor viewing dependence of the remote sensing reflectance derived from OCI. With a bidirectional remote sensing model based on quasi-single-scattering approximation to the radiative transfer equation, the angular shape of the volume scattering function (VSF) in backward directions, i.e., the χ factor for particles (χp) is derived from the multi-angle observation of HARP2. The derived χp is in turn used to drive the bidirectional remote sensing model to predict the bidirectional factor. Testing with prelaunch simulated HARP2 L1C data that includes uncertainties due to atmospheric correction, the proposed method can estimate bidirectional factor with an uncertainty <10 % at any three visible bands of HARP2. Because the proposed method estimates the χp directly from the multi-angle observation, it fully accounts for the natural variability of VSFs, which were assumed to confine within a limited range of variation in the earlier bidirectional correction models."

 Crop models are essential for evaluating the effects of climate change on crop yields, optimizing agronomic practices, and guiding policy decisions to enhance food security. However, using traditional crop models, including both process-based and statistical models, for regional applications presents significant challenges. Process-based crop models often require extensive, locally-sensed inputs to drive the models, which are generally lacking at the regional level. Meanwhile, statistical crop models depend heavily on training data, but it is often difficult, or even impossible, to find high-quality training data on a large scale. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a more physiologically based proxy for gross primary production (GPP), has shown good potential for estimating GPP and crop yield. We developed a practical SIF-based crop model driven by satellite SIF observations and three readily available datasets: air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and soil moisture content. The key improvement of our research is to parameterize the fraction of open PSII reaction centers (qL) for crops, and incorporate variations in qL into the SIF-based estimation of crop GPP and yield. Using a leaf-level measurement system, we provided parameters for qL in corn and soybean. We showed that the simulated qL closely matches the measured qL, with R2 > 0.95 and RMSE <0.05, even under conditions of high light and/or high temperature, whereas the performance of SIF alone significantly decreased under stress. By using SIF and qL within the mechanistic light response model, one can accurately estimate crop GPP without the need to parameterize various plant physiological processes or nutrient dynamics and management practices. This improvement substantially simplifies the model, reduces the need for driving variables and calibration data, and minimizes associated uncertainties. We applied the model to estimate corn and soybean yields in the U.S. Midwest for the period 2018–2023. A comparison with eddy covariance-based GPP measurements reveals that the simulated GPP accounts for 85 % of the variability in daily observed GPP for corn and 81 % for soybean. The model's performance at the regional scale was assessed by comparing it against county-level crop yield statistics. On average, the model captures 78 % of the county-level yield variability across more than 700 counties during the study period, achieving 76 % for corn and 81 % for soybean, with RMSE values of 14.47 Bu/Acre, and 4.09 Bu/Acre, respectively. The practical, yet mechanistic, SIF-based model introduced in this study represents a significant advance in regional and national crop yield estimation."

 Silty Midstream Yellow River (MYR), characterized by its turbid waters, is currently underserved by a sparse network of gauging stations, which is insufficient for comprehensive flow monitoring. Establishing an extensive gauging network in this region is almost impractical. This study addresses the challenge by estimating discharge at selected ungauged reaches of the MYR, leveraging multiple remote sensing datasets with high spatiotemporal resolutions, complemented by Manning’s Equation. Satellite observation reaches (SORs) were strategically positioned at each small river section between adjacent tributaries, chosen for their variable river width, stable channel terrain, and uniform flow, which are conducive to the application of Manning’s Equation. Hydraulic parameters for 16 SORs were calculated, integrating optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar data with a digital elevation model to derive river width, water surface level, and slope. River bathymetry and bed elevation, not directly observable by satellites, were simulated using an adapted altimetry-assimilated one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic model. The discharge time-series at the SOR locations was subsequently retrieved and validated against observed discharges at existing gauges, demonstrating high accuracy with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values ranging from 0.704 to 0.779 and R2 values from 0.773 to 0.925. This study effectively expanded discharge observations at ungauged river reaches, increasing the number of observation sites from three to sixteen and achieving an average monitoring interval of 2.7 days per site. The enhanced river discharge observations facilitated by remote sensing provides more granular water and sediment flux data, which is instrumental for future hydrological research and soil conservation planning within large river basins."

 Plantation forests have been increasingly established in Fagita Lekoma District, located in the Northwestern Highlands of Ethiopia, over the past two decades. However, their interaction with climate variables remains largely unexplored. This study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of plantation forests driven vegetation changes and their relationship with climate variables in the district from 2000 to 2020. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and Enhanced National Climate Services (ENACTS) data of the study area were processed for 21 years to examine trends using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator, employing R 4.3 programming software. Concurrently, various climatic data, including evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and rainfall, were processed, and analysed to explore the relationships between vegetation change and climate variability in the district during the study period. Increasing trends of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) greenness in the district were highlighted, with mean annual NDVI rising from 0.53 to 0.64, showing an average trend of 0.0036 year−1. This increase is primarily attributed to the widespread establishment of plantation forests across the district. The largest increase was revealed in ET, with a rate of 12.27 kg/m2 year−1. Conversely, LST and rainfall exhibited insignificant decreasing trends, with a rate of − 0.15 °C year−1 and − 10.54 mm year−1, respectively. Furthermore, a statistically significant positive correlation between NDVI and ET was observed, underscoring the critical role of vegetation in maintaining water availability. The negative correlation between NDVI and LST suggests that increased vegetation cover contributes to land surface temperature cooling. Additionally, the statistically insignificant negative correlation between NDVI and rainfall emphasizes the influence of land use change and human intervention on vegetation productivity. Overall, this study highlights the significance of long-term satellite observations in assessing the intricate interplays between vegetation dynamics driven by plantation forestry and climate variables at a local scale. The findings emphasize the role of plantation forests in enhancing vegetation greenness, improving water regulation, and mitigating land surface temperature warming, providing critical insights for sustainable land management and policy interventions in similar regions."

An improved cloud masking approach is proposed using additional information of the Alternate Floating Algae Index (AFAI) and a new normalized AFAI (nAFAI), as well as ratios of the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance ε(RC)(λi, λj) from the blue and near-infrared bands. Specifically, the proposed algorithm adds a recovery procedure after the original cloud masking to retrieve falsely masked pixels and identifies these pixels as turbid waters, floating algae or absorbing aerosols, from which ocean color products can be further derived.

This study investigates the characteristics of bioaerosols and bacterial communities in rural households of the Fenwei Plain, China, comparing indoor and outdoor environments and contrasting rural-urban differences. The peak concentrations of total airborne microbes (TAMs), viable bacteria, non-viable bacteria, and viability showed pronounced indoor/outdoor variations, meanwhile, rural areas exhibited significantly lower bioaerosol concentrations than urban areas. The bacterial communities displayed distinct indoor-outdoor patterns: Actinobacteria (40.5% and 27.3%) and Proteobacteria (34.5% and 40.3%) were the predominant phyla detected in kitchen and living room, respectively, while Bacteroidetes (41% and 51.5) for chimney and outdoor environment. Notably, rural areas showed 2.8 and 8 times higher relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes compared to urban areas, indicating fundamentally different microbial ecosystems. At the genus level, the top two bacteria were Vibrio and Chloroplast in indoor areas, whereas the predominant genera in outdoor areas included Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, and Bacteroides. Bacterial communities in urban and rural areas displayed significant heterogeneity. The peak and valley relative abundance of potential pathogenic bacteria in rural areas appeared in the chimney area (62.7%) and in the living room (18.3%), respectively. Rhodococcus and Prevotella were the indicator pathogenic bacteria for urban and rural sites, respectively, with links to pulmonary infections and intestinal diseases. This study provides valuable insights into the characteristics of bioaerosols and their implications for human health protection in rural areas."

 The Guenther 1993 (G-93) formula is the most extensively used algorithm for predicting leaf-scale isoprene emissions driven by temperature and light intensity, and has been incorporated into many isoprene emission models. The temperature and light response variables of the G-93 define the rate of increase (ascend) and decrease (descend) of emissions as driven by temperature and light intensity. Our previous study on the tropical tree Ficus septica noted that hot weather in the previous days impacted unevenly the ascend and descend changes of isoprene emission, causing a significant deviation between the G-93 prediction and observations. Separate parameterization of the ascend and the descend phases successfully ameliorated this deviation, however, the relationship between weather history and parameters for individual ascend and descend phase still warrants more detailed studies to inform their reliable use in emission algorithms. We herein further examined the relationship between weather history and G-93 parameters for individual ascending and descending phase responses. We found that among the G-93 parameters, CT1 and α correlated with cumulative temperature or PPFD, whilst CT2 essentially remained constant for both the ascending and descending phases. These correlations allowed us to parameterize the G-93 formula based on weather history for the first time, and direct modification of CT1 and α in terms of cumulative temperature and light intensity captured 96.6% of variation in the ascending and 98.1% in the descending phase in the study period. Separate parameterization of the upward and the downward changes was found to be effective in improving our ability to predict isoprene emission from plants that experienced hot weather in the previous days. More importantly, this result implies that the assumption of a symmetric response of isoprene emission across the maxima temperature and light intensity needs revision especially under circumstances of a warming climate."

 This study aims to evaluate and improve the performance of the scale-aware cumulus parameterization scheme (CPS) in the Korean Integrated Model (KIM), referred to as KSAS. The performance of the KSAS for simulating precipitation over Korea is first evaluated in comparison with other scale-aware CPSs available in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by conducting a series of experiments at multiple horizontal resolutions, including the gray zone. The results show that the KSAS significantly improves precipitation forecast skill compared to its original version. However, its performance is lower than that of the other scale-aware CPSs at 27-km and 9-km spatial resolutions due to the substantial contribution of cumulus parameterization. To address issues in the scale-aware parameterization of KSAS, the method for defining the convective updraft fraction is revised to adopt a more physically based approach. The WRF simulation results demonstrate improved precipitation forecast skill with the revised scale-aware parameterization at the gray-zone resolution, where the contribution of cumulus parameterization is significantly reduced. Further evaluation of the revised scheme in KIM also reveals enhanced medium-range forecast skill for both large-scale fields and precipitation at horizontal resolutions of NE360NP3 (∼12 km) and NE576NP3 (∼8 km). The warm bias in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere is alleviated by reduced convective heating. Notably, the revised scheme exhibits a pronounced improvement in the skill for forecasting precipitation over the Korean Peninsula, better capturing the pattern and intensity of the precipitation core for heavy rainfall events, as confirmed by higher skill scores."

 The main objective of this research, was to incorporate Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) estimations across backward air mass trajectories to the broadly used Trajectory Sector Analysis (TSA) and Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) methods, in order to attain a three-dimensional (3D) identification of aerosol transport pathways and to reveal the role of the Mixed Layer (ML) on the transferring of particulates. The developed 3D-TSA and 3D-CWT tools, were combined with daily concentrations of PM10-bound SO42−, NO3−, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ measured at three rural sampling sites in Spain during the years 2019–2020. Vertically extended Saharan dust intrusions from North Africa were associated with air masses travelling both inside and outside the ML and were related to increases of PM10-bound SO42− and Ca2+ at all stations, attributed to the reactions of mineral dust with gaseous precursors of SO42− such as SO2. The advection of sea salt particles, marked by high levels of Na+ and Mg2+, was associated with marine air masses from the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, moving mainly within the ML. Enhanced levels of PM10 constituents emitted by anthropogenic sources, such as NO3− (traffic and industrial emissions) and K+ (biomass burning), were clearly related to air masses originating from Iberian Peninsula, Central Europe and North African coastline, whilst in most cases the strongest contributions were transferred by air masses moving above the ML. Therefore, the implemented 3D version of TSA and CWT methods, revealed new information regarding the altitudinal characteristics of air masses affecting PM10 levels in Spain."

 The study on transmission characteristics of lightning return-stroke currents along the channel is of great significance for deeply understanding the microphysical mechanisms of lightning discharge processes, improving theoretical models, and optimizing lightning protection systems. Based on the spectra obtained from three lightning processes and the waveforms of ground electric field changes caused by the lightning, the characteristic parameters such as channel temperature, linear charge density, and radius are calculated. Combined with the electrodynamics model of lightning, the propagation process of electromagnetic waves in the lightning channel and the surrounding corona sheath is simulated, and the dispersion curves, as well as the intensity changes of radial and axial electric fields are obtained under two conditions: with and without considering the electrical conductivity in the corona sheath. The impact of the actual electrical conductivity distribution in the corona sheath on the transmission characteristic of electromagnetic waves is analyzed for the first time. On this basis, the transmission law of current along the channel height at different moments for the three return-strokes is simulated. The results show that compared with the case that only the electrical conductivity of the current-carrying core channel is considered, the radial distribution of electrical conductivity in the outer corona sheath will slow down the decay rate of current transmission along the channel. The larger the radius of the high electrical conductivity channel, the smaller the decay rate of the return-stroke current along the channel. In the early stage of the return-stroke, the current intensity decays rapidly along the channel height, decaying in an exponential form. As time goes on, the current decay slows down and gradually transitions to a linear decay or a uniform distribution form. It further confirms that the decay of the return-stroke current along the channel height is mainly manifested in the early stage of the return-stroke. The radius of the current-carrying channel and the distribution of conductivity in the corona sheath are key factors affecting the transmission decay of current along the channel."
