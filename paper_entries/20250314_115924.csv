10.5194/acp-25-3011-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注重度臭氧污染下的氧化过程，通过测量大气中的自由基（OH、HO2、RO2）以及kOH来研究化学复杂大气中的氧化限制。论文还利用模型模拟（RACM2-LIM1）和灵敏度测试来评估不同化学机制（如HAM）对自由基浓度和臭氧生成的影响。研究结果表明，考虑OVOCs和单萜烯衍生的较大烷氧基自由基可以提高模型与观测数据的一致性，从而更好地理解重度臭氧污染期间的氧化过程。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其对大气成分的分析和对空气质量监测的贡献使其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是通过地面观测数据来验证和改进大气化学模型，这些模型可以用于遥感数据的解释和应用。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'ozone pollution', 'radicals (OH, HO2, RO2)', 'OVOCs', 'chemical mechanism modeling']",Renzhi Hu;Guoxian Zhang;Haotian Cai;Jingyi Guo;Keding Lu;Xin Li;Shengrong Lou;Zhaofeng Tan;Changjin Hu;Pinhua Xie;Wenqing Liu,Accurate elucidation of oxidation under heavy ozone pollution: a full suite of radical measurements in the chemically complex atmosphere,"A full suite of radical measurements (OH, HO2, RO2, and kOH) was established to accurately elucidate the limitations of oxidation in a chemically complex atmosphere. Sensitivity tests revealed that the incorporation of complex processes enabled a balance in both radical concentrations and coordinate ratios, effectively addressing the deficiency in the ozone generation mechanism. The full-chain radical detection bridged the gap between the photochemistry and the intensive oxidation level. 
 The Yangze River Delta (YRD) in China encountered prolonged ozone pollution in September 2020. To accurately elucidate the limitations of oxidation processes in the chemically complex atmosphere, a full suite of radical measurements (OH, HO2, RO2, and kOH) was established in the YRD region for the first time. The diurnal peaks of radicals exhibited considerable variation due to environmental factors, showing ranges of 3.6 to 27.1 × 106 cm−3 for OH, 2.1 to 33.2 × 108 cm−3 for HO2, and 4.9 to 30.5 × 108 cm−3 for RO2. The simulated results provided by RACM2-LIM1 failed to adequately match the observed data in both radical concentration and experimental budget for a heavy ozone pollution episode. Sensitivity tests utilizing a comprehensive set of radical measurements revealed that the Higher Aldehyde Mechanism (HAM) effectively complements the regeneration of OH radicals, yielding enhancements of 4.4 %–6.0 % compared to the base scenario, while the concentrations of HO2 and RO2 radicals have shown increments of about 7.4 % and 12.5 %, respectively. It is noteworthy that under the constraints of kOH measurement, the inclusion of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and larger alkoxy radicals derived from monoterpenes improved the model–measurement consistency for ozone formation, reducing the discrepancy under high NO conditions from 4.17 to 2.39. This outcome corroborates the hypothesis of sensitivity analysis as it pertains to ozone formation. Moving forward, by implementing a comprehensive radical detection approach, further investigations should concentrate on a broader range of OVOCs to rectify the imbalance associated with RO2 radicals, thereby providing a more precise understanding of oxidation processes during severe ozone pollution episodes."

This analysis isolated 90 southwesterly NLLJs observed from May to September 2017–2021, highlighting key features in the evolution and morphology of the mid-Atlantic NLLJ. 
 This paper introduces a machine-learning-driven approach for automated nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ) identification using observations of wind profiles from a radar wind profiler (RWP). The work discussed here is an effort to lay the groundwork for a systematic study of the mid-Atlantic NLLJ's formation mechanisms and their influence on nocturnal and diurnal air quality in major urban regions by establishing a general framework of NLLJ features and characteristics with an identification algorithm. Leveraging a comprehensive wind profile dataset maintained by the Maryland Department of the Environment's RWP network, our methodology employs supervised-machine-learning techniques to isolate the features of the southwesterly NLLJ because of its association with pollution transport in the mid-Atlantic states. This methodology was developed to illuminate spatiotemporal patterns and physical characteristics of NLLJ events to study their role in planetary boundary layer evolution and composition. This paper discusses the construction of this methodology, its performance against known NLLJs in the current literature, intended usage, and a preliminary statistical analysis. The results from this analysis have yielded a total of 90 southwesterly NLLJs from May–September of 2017–2021, as captured by the RWP stationed in Beltsville, MD (39.05° N, 76.87° W; 135 m a.s.l.). A composite analysis of 90 jets reveals that the mid-Atlantic NLLJ is characterized by a core wind speed exceeding 10 m s−1 at altitudes typically between 300–500 m above ground level, with maximum wind speeds occurring between 3–6 h after sunset. The jets show consistent wind direction from the southwest but transition from more southerly- to more westerly-dominated with increasing altitude and time after sunset. We hope our study equips researchers and policymakers with further means to monitor, predict, and address these nocturnal dynamics phenomena that frequently influence boundary layer composition and air quality in the US mid-Atlantic and northeastern regions."

Via labelling with unique identifiers, the database allows for a quick and consistent retrieval of all of the resources associated with a storm event. The adopted approach can be easily exported to all European countries and beyond. 
 Detailed information on coastal storm impacts is crucial to evaluate the degree of physical and economic damage caused by floods, implement effective recovery actions for risk prevention and preparedness, and design appropriate coastal zone management plans. This article presents a new database containing information on extreme storm events that generated impacts and flooding along European coastlines between 2010 and 2020. The storm events, associated with specific locations, are used to define test cases that are subsequently employed to retrieve information from different extreme coastal storms that hit the same area. The database collects items organized in worksheets and constitutes an inventory of resources with different types of information that is employed to characterize a storm event (i.e. hydrodynamics and weather information) and its consequences (impacts, flood extent, etc.). The guidelines and polygons (in GeoJSON format) that define the domain of the sites are also provided along with the database. The database contains 11 coastal storm events, 26 sites, 28 test cases, and 232 resources, and it has been designed to allow the addition of new events and resources. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to define the types and topics addressed by the resources and the distribution of the resource types per country.

To enhance our understanding of hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics of the NP, a multi-year field observation campaign was designed and conducted from 2015 to 2018. This campaign improves the temporal and spatial coverage compared to previous observations, enabling more detailed investigations of this important channel system. 
 A comprehensive multi-year field campaign, the North Passage Channel Measurements (NP-ChaM), was designed and executed to enhance our understanding of the hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics in the North Passage, the primary navigation channel of the Changjiang Estuary, China. The NP-ChaM campaign comprised eight observational sites and spanned 50 d, distributed over 4 years, including two dry seasons and two wet seasons. A series of tripod systems, equipped with multiple instruments, were deployed on the seabed to monitor near-bed physical processes reliably.The resulting dataset comprises the following: (i) fluid motions, encompassing pressure, flow velocity and direction (at the bottom and throughout the entire water column), and wave patterns; (ii) near-bed environmental conditions, including temperature, salinity, and turbidity (at the bottom and across a near-bed 1-meter range); (iii) supplementary meteorological data sourced from credible providers; and (iv) preliminary results from post-processing, showcasing the practical application of the data, such as lateral flows and turbulent kinetic energy characterizations.This dataset is especially valuable due to its extensive temporal and spatial coverage, as well as the high concentrations characterizing many of the observations (from several grams per liter to tens of grams per liter). Conducted annually from 2015 to 2018, the NP-ChaM campaign facilitated detailed observations of seasonal variations in environmental conditions and associated physical processes. The eight observational sites, positioned on either side of the deep channel, enable quantifications of channel–shoal exchanges, along-channel flow dynamics, and saltwater intrusion. This dataset is suitable for advancing our understanding of along-channel and cross-channel dynamics in a channel–shoal system and for calibrating numerical models. The dataset has undergone rigorous quality control to ensure reliability and accuracy.

 Landslide inventories play a vital role in assessing susceptibility, hazards, and risks and are essential for developing resilience strategies in mountainous areas. This importance is amplified in the context of climate change as existing inventories might not adequately reflect changing stability conditions. In May 2023, the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy was hit by two major rainfall events, leading to widespread flooding and the triggering of thousands of landslides. Predominantly, these were shallow debris slides and debris flows, occurring on slopes previously deemed to be stable based on historical data, with no prior landslides recorded. Our team supported the Civil Protection Agency through field surveys and mapping efforts to pinpoint and record these landslides, prioritizing areas critical to immediate public safety and focusing on thorough mapping for future recovery planning. The outcome is a detailed map of all landslides induced by these events, manually identified using high-resolution aerial photography (0.2 m pixel resolution; four bands – RGB and near-infrared (NIR)) and categorized with the help of a 3D viewer.

To understand the EAC regime and the inner shelf dynamics, we implement a variational approach to produce the first multiyear coastal radar dataset (2012–2023) in this region. The validated data allow for a comprehensive investigation of the EAC dynamics. This dataset will be useful for understanding the complex EAC regime and its far-reaching impacts on the shelf environment. 
 The East Australian Current (EAC) exhibits significant variability across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, from mesoscale eddies and meanders to seasonal, interannual, and long-term fluctuations in its intensity, pathway, and influence on the continental shelf circulation. Understanding and monitoring this variability is crucial, as the EAC plays an important role in controlling shelf dynamics, regional circulation, coastal weather, and global climate patterns. As such, two high-frequency (HF) coastal radar systems have been deployed on the eastern coast of Australia to measure surface currents upstream and downstream of the East Australian Current (EAC) separation point. The multiyear radar dataset (spanning 4–8 years) is presented here, and its use is demonstrated to assess the spatial and temporal variability in the EAC and the adjacent continental shelf circulation, ranging from seasonal to interannual scales. The dataset is gap-filled using a 2dVar approach (after rigorous comparison with the traditional unweighted least-squares (LS) fit method). Additionally, we explore the representation of the depth variability in the observations by comparing the data with surface Lagrangian drifter velocities (with and without depth drogues). The multiyear radar-derived surface current dataset, which was validated using short-term drifter and long-term current meter observations, revealed that the local upstream circulation is strongly dominated by the EAC's annual cycle, peaking in the austral summer. The analysis using 8 years of upstream data revealed the period of the EAC intensification at around 3–5 years. The interannual variability in the poleward transport downstream was driven by the intrinsic variability in the jet. This dataset which continues to be collected, complemented by numerical simulations and in situ measurements, will provide a comprehensive view of the EAC's variability and its impact on the broader regional circulation dynamics that can be used for a range of dynamical investigations.

Vernon,Long-term hydro-economic analysis tool for evaluating global groundwater cost and supply: Superwell v1.1,"Superwell is a physics-based hydro-economic model that estimates the production costs and availability of groundwater worldwide. It calculates how much groundwater can be extracted and at what cost, using detailed maps and data of the Earth's properties. Through these estimates, and by using them with other models, Superwell facilitates exploration of coupled human–environmental system challenges, such as future water supply sustainability or multi-sectoral energy–water–land feedbacks. 
 Groundwater plays a key role in meeting water demands, supplying over 40 % of irrigation water globally, with this role likely to grow as water demands and surface water variability increase. A better understanding of the future role of groundwater in meeting sectoral demands requires an integrated hydro-economic evaluation of its cost and availability. Yet substantial gaps remain in our knowledge and modeling capabilities related to groundwater availability, recharge, feasible locations for extraction, extractable volumes, and associated extraction costs, which are essential for large-scale analyses of integrated human–water system scenarios, particularly at the global scale. To address these needs, we developed Superwell, a physics-based groundwater extraction and cost accounting model that operates at sub-annual temporal and at the coarsest 0.5° (≈50 km × 50 km) gridded spatial resolution with global coverage. The model produces location-specific groundwater supply–cost curves that provide the levelized cost to access different quantities of available groundwater. The inputs to Superwell include recent high-resolution hydrogeologic datasets of permeability, porosity, aquifer thickness, depth to water table, recharge, and hydrogeological complexity zones. It also accounts for well capital and maintenance costs, as well as the energy costs required to lift water to the surface. The model employs a Theis-based scheme coupled with an amortization-based cost accounting formulation to simulate groundwater extraction and quantify the cost of groundwater pumping. The result is a spatiotemporally flexible, physically realistic, economics-based model that produces groundwater supply–cost curves. We show examples of these supply–cost curves and the insights that can be derived from them across a set of scenarios designed to explore model outcomes. The supply–cost curves produced by the model show that most (90 %) nonrenewable groundwater in storage globally is extractable at costs lower than USD 0.57 m−3, while half of the volume remains extractable at under USD 0.108 m−3. The global unit cost is estimated to range from a minimum of USD 0.004 m−3 to a maximum of USD 3.971 m−3. We also demonstrate and discuss examples of how these cost curves could be used by linking Superwell's outputs with other models to explore coupled human–environmental system challenges, such as water resources planning and management, or broader analyses of multisectoral feedbacks."

Using 112 sensitivity experiments with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and focusing on 28 wind events, it is found that wind direction was less sensitive to the PBL schemes. The quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE) scheme captured temporal variations best, while the Mellor–Yamada–Janjić (MYJ) scheme had the least error in wind speed. 
 The topography of the Sichuan Basin is complex, and high-resolution wind field simulations over this region are of great significance for meteorology, air quality, and wind energy utilization. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to investigate the performance of different planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes in simulating near-surface wind fields over the Sichuan Basin at a spatial resolution of 0.33 km. The experiment is based on multiple case studies of a selection of 28 near-surface wind events from 2021 to 2022, and a total of 112 sensitivity simulations were carried out and compared to observations by employing four commonly used PBL schemes: the Yonsei University (YSU) scheme, the Mellor–Yamada–Janjić (MYJ) scheme, the Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–Niino level 2 (MYNN2) scheme, and the quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE) scheme. The results demonstrate that the wind direction can be reasonably reproduced, and its sensitivity to the PBL scheme appears to be less pronounced compared to the near-surface wind speed, though some variability is still observed. As for wind speed, the QNSE scheme had the best performance in reproducing the temporal variation out of the four schemes, while the MYJ scheme had the smallest model bias. Further cluster analysis demonstrates that the sensitivity of the PBL schemes is affected by diurnal variation and different circulation geneses. For instance, when the near-surface wind event, caused by the southward movement of strong cold air, occurred between 06:00 and 08:00 UTC, the variation and speed were well reproduced by all four PBL schemes, and the differences between them were small. However, the simulation results for strong winds occurring during midnight to the early hours of the morning exhibit poor root mean square errors but high correlation coefficients, whereas for strong wind processes happening in the early to late evening hours and for southwesterly wind processes, the opposite pattern occurs. Overall, the four schemes are better for near-surface wind simulations in daytime than at night. The results show the role of PBL schemes in wind field simulations under unstable weather conditions and provide a valuable reference for further research in the study area and surrounding areas."

Among ∼21 million participants for AD and ∼20 million for ADRD, each interquartile range increase in UFP exposure (3701.6 and 3668.5 particles/cm3, respectively) was associated with higher AD (HR: 1.026, 95% CI: 1.014–1.038) and ADRD (HR: 1.016, 95% CI: 1.008–1.023) risks. The association was linear within typical exposure levels and stronger in individuals with comorbidities. Geographically, the UFP-associated dementia risk was higher in rural areas than in urban areas, possibly due to different pollution sources. These findings underscore UFPs as neurotoxicants and highlight the need for targeted public health interventions to protect vulnerable populations."

This work found the synergistic effect of light and sulfite on destroying rCOPR stability, causing the significant release of Cr(VI), which was 4∼7 times higher than that under single factor action. In CrxFe1–x(OH)3/sulfite/light system, Cr(VI) release rate could reach 11.11 × 10–7 M min–1 g–1, because of the rapid formation of ·OH, O2·–, SO4·–, and quadrivalent iron [Fe(IV)]. In addition, this study found that the oxidized chromium residue could continuously release Cr(III) after being transferred to the dark environment. This should be attributed to the obvious change in the iron coordination structure of rCOPR caused by the catalytic reaction of sulfite with light, which greatly weakened the ability of the Fe–O structure to encase chromium elements in a solid. These insights are crucial for predicting the environmental risks of rCOPR in the presence of visible light and sulfur-containing compounds."

We employed taxi-based measurements with 30 m resolution to characterize PM2.5 exposure with local source contribution (PM2.5 adjusted concentration) discerned for 2019 winter and 2020 summer, in Xi’an. A big data set comprising ∼6 × 106 hourly PM2.5 measurements and SES data from ∼5000 communities was utilized to examine the socioeconomic inequalities in community-level PM2.5 exposure. Our results indicate that the inhabitants with lower SES are more likely to be disproportionately exposed compared to those with higher SES. At least 92% of disproportionately exposed inhabitants in rural regions reside in low SES areas, whereas a relatively smaller proportion (69–78%) reside in urban regions. The local source has a more profound impact on PM2.5 exposure during summer than winter. The inhabitants in polluted areas and low PM2.5 adjusted concentration areas accounted for 22% and 26% of total PM2.5 exposure during the winter. However, inhabitants residing in low-concentration areas contributed only 12% of total exposure during summer while those polluted areas contributed 30%.

In this study, a functional flower-like TiO2@Mn/rGO (FTMG) catalyst coupled with a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lamp was used as a novel photocatalytic oxidation (VUV–PCO) system for chlorobenzene (CB) oxidation. In this system, more than 80% of CB was efficiently oxidized at a high w8 hly space velocity of 600,000 gcat–1 h–1, which was a 6.5-fold increase compared to conventional UV–PCO, and no catalytic deactivation over 1300 min of reaction. Notably, the COx selectivity consistently reached 100%. These outstanding performances were attributed to the synergy of direct VUV photolysis and gas–solid interface photocatalysis. Importantly, the C–Cl bond of CB was efficiently cleaved by VUV photolysis, generating •Cl as the oxidant. Ozone (O3) generated from VUV photolysis was efficiently adsorbed on oxygen vacancies and Mn (Ov + Mn) adjacent sites on FTMG. These adsorbed O3 rapidly captured the photogenerated electrons, thereby effectively preventing Cl reduction and avoiding catalyst deactivation. This study sheds light on the unique dechlorination reaction and Cl-poisoning-resistance mechanism in the VUV–PCO system, offering a novel strategy to boost the catalytic oxidation of Cl–VOCs."

However, until now, evidence for the translocation of airborne nanoparticles (NPs) in the human kidney has been lacking, hindering the understanding of the relationships between PM2.5 exposure and kidney diseases. Here, we report the discovery and analysis of airborne magnetite nanoparticles in human kidney stones (with mass concentrations ranging from 363 to 740 ng/g dry tissue weight) by high-resolution microstructural characterization. Notably, we established a methodology for highly selective extraction and accurate characterization of distinctive magnetite NPs and identified the abundant presence of these NPs with a distinctive core–shell structure of Fe3O4/SiO2 in both kidney stones and human blood. We demonstrate that such distinctive core–shell magnetite NPs are indicative of a coal-burning source. Hence, magnetite NPs deposited in the human kidneys in this study area most likely derived from air pollution emissions from coal-fired power plants and were transported via blood circulation to the kidney. Our results provide compelling evidence for understanding the systemic health risks of exposure to nanoparticulate, Fe-bearing air pollution and the associations observed between kidney diseases and PM2.5 exposure."

Here, laboratory-based combustion experiments were conducted to characterize EPFRs for different pellets burned in cooking and heating stoves and compared with those for the corresponding uncompressed biofuels. Emission factors (EFs) of EPFRs for biomass pellets ranged from 2.97 × 1017 to 2.33 × 1019 spins/kg, following a log-normal distribution, with a geometric mean of 4.21 × 1018 spins/kg. These EPFRs were carbon-centered free radicals adjacent to oxygen atoms. Emissions varied largely across different fuel–stove combinations, with the combustion efficiency and combustion temperature as key influencing factors explaining 49% of the variations in EFPR EFs. Compared to raw fuels, pelletized fuels showed 50–80% lower EPFR EFs and 40–70% lower EPFRs per PM but more different EPFR types, and there was no significant change in the degree of oxidation of the EPFRs. The burning of pellets made from crop residues in a clean cookstove can reduce nearly 90% EFPRs from the raw biomass burning, which is different from the reduction degree in PM mass.

This would result in a moderate reduction of O3 pollution, decreasing the average number of population-weighted O3 exceedance days in August from 9 to 6 days, and would shift the majority of LA, except for the coastline, into a NOx-limited regime. Our results also show that adopting ZEVs for on-road diesel and off-road vehicles would further reduce the number of O3 exceedance days in August to an average of 1 day."

However, the roles of photogenerated carriers in PFR formation remain underexplored. We compared and analyzed the PFR formation on hematite-SiO2 loaded catechol, combining experimental and theoretical investigations. Significant PFRs were observed only under ultraviolet light irradiation. The PFR concentration on hematite nanoplates (HP, 1.29 × 1017 spins/mg) was higher than those on hematite nanocubes (HC, 9.19 × 1016 spins/mg) and nanorods (HR, 7.02 × 1016 spins/mg). A stronger stability of PFRs on HR (183 h of t1/e) was observed compared with HP (95.4 h of t1/e) and HC (37.7 h of t1/e). Photoelectrochemical analysis and quenching experiments indicated that photogenerated holes, rather than electrons, controlled the PFR formation. Photogenerated holes manipulate the asymmetric distribution of up-spin and down-spin electrons in the p orbital of catechol to regulate PFR formation. Hole quantity and exposed facets caused significant differences in the concentration and stability of PFRs. The high concentration of PFRs on HP is due to abundant holes, while the weak stability of PFRs on HC is due to the exposed {012} facet. This study introduces a novel mechanism for PFR formation regulated by photogenerated holes, contributing to a better understanding of their environmental function and associated risks."

Using a population cohort from the UK Biobank, we aimed to investigate the mediating role of psychiatric disorders on the associations between floods and dementia. In this study, cumulative exposure to floods over an eight-year period preceding the study baseline was assessed for each participant at residential addresses. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to study the associations of flooding exposure with psychiatric disorders and dementia. Stratified analyses and mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether psychiatric disorders mediate the relationship between floods and dementia.

Using land surface models and water budget simulations, we examined the extent to which increased flow was driven by natural climate variability, anthropogenic climate trends, land‐use and land‐cover change (LULCC), and ecological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2. Natural climate variability (arising largely from coupled ocean‐atmosphere circulation systems in both the Pacific and North Atlantic) accounted for ∼765 m3 s−1 of the ∼900 m3 s−1 increase in flow since mid‐century, while anthropogenic climate trends negatively forced flow by increasing evapotranspiration more than precipitation. LULCC and elevated CO2 further increased simulated mean streamflow by ∼550 and ∼70 m3 s−1, respectively, relative to pre‐Industrial conditions and ∼100 and ∼65 m3 s−1 relative to mid‐20th century conditions. The LULCC effect was especially large in wet years, implying that current land cover is ill‐suited for buffering against extreme precipitation, likely in large part due to replacement of forest by cropland in the lower basin. Because increases in Missouri River flow over the past century were driven mostly by a recent (and likely transient) pluvial, our results suggest that flow in the basin could revert to a drier mean state when that pluvial ends, likely made worse by increased evaporative demand from anthropogenic warming."

In 2022, Hurricane Ian generated extensive river plumes laden with nutrients, followed by a large K. brevis bloom that lasted for six months. Analysis using a coupled hydrodynamic‐biogeochemical model showed that Hurricane Ian drove the bloom in two ways. First, northerly winds on the western half of Ian generated coastal upwelling and onshore bottom currents that transported subsurface K. brevis cells toward the coast.

We find that a near‐surface dry region forms prior to the passage of a strong front. The near‐surface dry air originates in the upper atmosphere over the Indian Ocean and Southern Ocean, before circulating around an anticyclone, descending as a dry slot onto a deep mixed layer, and finally rapidly reaching the surface through convective rolls. A second dry region forms after the front passes. Again, much of the dry air originates in the upper atmosphere near Antarctica, before descending to the top of the boundary layer and forming a postfrontal dry slot. The dry air then mixes rapidly to the surface. These findings have potential applications for fire weather forecasting and fire management."

The results show that, during transport to the Pacific, dust from North Africa and the Middle East first moves northeast to Central Asia (30–55°N) and ascends to 200–400 hPa before crossing East Asia. In contrast, dust from the Taklamakan Desert in East Asia rises to 300–400 hPa before being transported eastward. As these dust sources descend into East Asia, they often mix with dust from the Gobi Desert. Indian dust travels zonally eastward at altitudes of 600–800 hPa over Southeast Asia without mixing. In the northwest Pacific, reanalysis data show that while dust is concentrated near the surface, maximum outflow to the Pacific occurs at 400 hPa in the mid‐latitudes due to strong westerlies. Trajectory analysis combined with observations suggests that this high‐altitude transport includes dust from the Sahara, Arabia, and Taklamakan deserts. At Mt. Lulin along the subtropical coast of East Asia, measured dust concentrations during dust events range from 15 to 39 μg m−3, while the annual average is close to 5 μg m−3, accounting for 42% of the aerosol concentration over the high mountain."

Williams,The Seasonal Variation of the Direct Current Global Electric Circuit: 1. A New Analysis Based on Long‐Term Measurements in Antarctica,"It has long been noted that the seasonal behavior of the global electric circuit (GEC) is difficult to reliably determine from measurements of atmospheric electrical parameters, largely owing to prominent annual cycles of aerosols affecting the conductivity in most continental locations. Here we discuss earlier studies in this direction and present further analysis of this problem using the results of potential gradient (PG) measurements at the Vostok station in Antarctica during 2006–2020. Collected at the high and remote Antarctic Plateau, Vostok PG values form a unique continuous data set indicating the variation of atmospheric electricity on different timescales; on the annual timescale the uniformity and consistency of the data turn out to be especially important (in particular, seasonal behavior of GEC parameters at specific UTC hours may be substantially different from the respective diurnal mean variation). PG measurements at Vostok indicate the highest and lowest values of the diurnal mean GEC intensity during the Northern Hemisphere summer and winter, respectively; this variation generally agrees with the available results of air—Earth current measurements. The seasonal variation of the GEC has been previously linked to the annual cycle of insolation; our findings further support this relationship, as it can provide a physical explanation not only for the summer PG maximum observed at Vostok but also for a small local minimum inside this maximum. The dominance of the Northern Hemisphere in the resulting variation is apparently related to the latitudinally asymmetrical distribution of land over the Earth's surface."

Cox,Surface Energy Balance Responses to Radiative Forcing in the Central Arctic From MOSAiC and Models,"The Arctic surface energy budget (SEB) couples the atmosphere with the sea ice, making it useful for both studying surface processes as well as evaluating models. Improved understanding of atmosphere‐ice interactions is required to improve models, requiring year‐round observations to address seasonally dependent biases. This work uses novel observations from the MOSAiC expedition to quantify the responses of surface fluxes to radiative forcing over sea ice throughout a complete annual cycle. We identify two primary regimes of flux response: an ice growth regime in winter and an ice melt regime in summer. In the growth regime, changes in radiative forcing impact upwelling longwave, sensible heat, and subsurface heat fluxes, whereas in the melt regime changes in radiative forcing primarily alter the amount of melt and subsurface transmission because the surface temperature is fixed. These observed responses of surface fluxes to radiative forcing are used to evaluate seven weather forecast models during the ice growth regime. In most models, the responses of surface fluxes to radiative forcing do not match observations. Many models also have biased downwelling longwave. One model (the Coupled Arctic Forecast System; CAFS) adequately captures both the mean radiative forcing and the flux responses in winter. CAFS is further evaluated against observations spanning the full MOSAiC year, demonstrating sufficient agreement to provide a more generalized understanding of these SEB process relationships across the Arctic."

Based on the multivariate empirical orthogonal function (MV‐EOF) method, this study identifies two dominant modes of summer NWP MHWs. The first mode, characterized by widespread warming across the low‐latitude NWP, occurs during the summer following an El Niño event. This mode is strongly associated with the Pacific–Japan teleconnection pattern and sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly gradient between the North Indian Ocean and tropical western Pacific. The second mode exhibits a northeast‐to‐southwest tripole structure, representing the summer phase during El Niño development. This tripole pattern is possibly influenced by the North Pacific Oscillation, highlighting an extratropical–tropical teleconnection that propagates the effects of positive SST anomalies. Using physics‐based empirical prediction models validated by the leave‐one‐out cross‐validation approach, a notable degree of predictability is found for these MHW modes. The temporal correlation coefficient scores and Root Mean Square Errors between observed and predicted principal components (PC1 and PC2) reach 0.65 and 0.77 for PC1 and 0.55 and 0.84 for PC2, respectively, over the period 1982–2022. Both models effectively capture the peak intensity and spatial distribution of MHWs, despite minor discrepancies. These findings might advance our understanding of MHW dynamics in the NWP and provide a foundation for developing early warning systems to mitigate their adverse effects on marine ecosystems and coastal communities."

Additional research is needed to ensure that climate intervention strategies will be safe, effective, and environmentally acceptable. The importance of the Arctic in influencing global climate has led investigators to propose various climate intervention strategies specific to the Arctic (Strawa et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.08.010). One approach, proposed by Field et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EF000820), is to distribute reflective hollow glass microspheres (HGM) on strategic areas of Arctic sea ice at strategic times to reduce ice melt, thereby slowing the Arctic ice‐albedo feedback and interrupting further acceleration of ice melt. While research into this technique is still in its early stages, results show this approach can effectively slow melt of Arctic sea ice (Field et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EF000820; Johnson et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2022ef002883). On the other hand, a recent paper by Webster and Warren (2022, https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022EF002815) claims that this technique would warm the Arctic and speed up ice loss. Webster and Warren (2022), https://doi.org/10.1029/2022ef002815 largely ignore the promising results of field experiments conducted using hollow glass microspheres on pond ice (Field et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EF000820; Johnson et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2022ef002883) and instead present an analysis that hinges upon a very high absorptance value for HGM.

 Frictional interfaces are found in systems ranging from biological joints to earthquake faults. When and how these interfaces slide is a fundamental problem in geosciences and engineering1–20. It is believed that there exists a threshold shear force, called static friction, below which the interface is stationary4,10, despite many studies suggesting that this concept is outdated1,21–28. By contrast, rate-and-state friction formulations1,26,27 predict that interfaces are always sliding29, but this feature is often considered an artefact that calls for modifications30. Here we show that nominally stationary interfaces subjected to constant shear and normal loads, with a driving force that is notably below the classically defined static friction for which creep is known to occur9,27–29, are sliding, but with diminishingly small rates down to 10−12 m s−1. Our precise measurements directly at the interface are enabled by digital image correlation18,31,32. This behaviour contradicts classical models of friction but confirms the prediction of rate-and-state friction1,26,27. The diminishing slip rates of nominally stationary interfaces reflect interface healing, which would manifest itself in higher peak friction in subsequent slip events15,27,33, such as earthquakes and landslides, substantially modifying their nucleation and propagation and hence their hazard3,12,13,34.

 Although learning in response to extrinsic reinforcement is theorized to be driven by dopamine signals that encode the difference between expected and experienced rewards1,2, skills that enable verbal or musical expression can be learned without extrinsic reinforcement. Instead, spontaneous execution of these skills is thought to be intrinsically reinforcing3,4. Whether dopamine signals similarly guide learning of these intrinsically reinforced behaviours is unknown. In juvenile zebra finches learning from an adult tutor, dopamine signalling in a song-specialized basal ganglia region is required for successful song copying, a spontaneous, intrinsically reinforced process5. Here we show that dopamine dynamics in the song basal ganglia faithfully track the learned quality of juvenile song performance on a rendition-by-rendition basis. Furthermore, dopamine release in the basal ganglia is driven not only by inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons classically associated with reinforcement learning but also by song premotor inputs, which act by means of local cholinergic signalling to elevate dopamine during singing. Although both cholinergic and dopaminergic signalling are necessary for juvenile song learning, only dopamine tracks the learned quality of song performance. Therefore, dopamine dynamics in the basal ganglia encode performance quality during self-directed, long-term learning of natural behaviours. Dopamine release in the basal ganglia of the zebra finch is driven by neurons associated with reinforcement learning and by cholinergic signalling, and tracks performance quality during long-term learning of its song."

The recent challenge lies primarily in developing high-performance red CPL emitters. Here, coupling the f-f transition characteristics of trivalent europium ions (Eu3+) with chirality, we construct the chiral Eu-based halides, (R/S-3BrMBA)3EuCl6, which exhibit strong and predictable red emission with large photoluminescence quantum yield (59.8%), narrow bandwidth (≈2 nm), long lifetime (≈2 ms), together with large dissymmetry factor |glum| of 1.84 × 10−2. Compared with the previously reported chiral metal halides, these chiral Eu-based halides show the highest red CPL brightness. Furthermore, the degree of photoluminescence polarization in (R/S-3BrMBA)3EuCl6 can be manipulated by the external magnetic field. Particularly, benefiting from the field-generated Zeeman splitting and spin mixing at exciton states, an anomalously positive magneto-photoluminescence was observed at room temperature.

Its low power consumption and on-board energy harvesting capability allows for 24 hours of light-to-microwave information transmission with 8 hours of sole sunlight energy input. A hybrid wireless communication system for real-time image transmission is demonstrated to show the outstanding features of SLMPM. We believe that SLMPM can contribute to the sustainable advancement of future wireless communications, rendering them more cost-effective, energy-efficient, environment-friendly, and ubiquitous.

This study shows how a government-supported strategy of overfishing this sea urchin could help conservation and fisheries outcomes. 
 Climate change is driving species to colonize new ranges, sometimes causing uncontrollable damage. Here we present a remarkable scenario in which government-supported incentives have driven the establishment of a commercial fishery targeting a destructive urchin, intentionally encouraging overfishing to protect kelp ecosystems. This ecosystem management strategy is paradoxical in the objective to overfish sustainably. Due to consistent and increasing larval influx, the eradication of urchins in their extended range is implausible. Management, therefore, focuses on maintaining urchin density below a critical threshold while ensuring a viable commercial fishery for long-term species control. Our model dissects the fishery’s impact, offering practical strategies for controlling a destructive range extender given economic and spatial dynamics. Beyond the implications of subsidizing a commercial fishery to counteract the impacts of climate change, our study explores the conflict between exploitation and conservation, challenging traditional views and presenting practical pathways to sustainability.

 Although the productivity of modern volcanic soils is well established, the fertilization effects of ancient volcanic ash on aqueous ecosystems remains contentious. Here we demonstrate volcanic fertilization effects on a Late Triassic lacustrine ecosystem based on micropaleontological and geochemical records from the Yanchang Formation of North China. Frequent eruptions of a regional volcanic arc system increased cyanobacterial populations and organic carbon sinking fluxes, as recorded by extreme total organic carbon content (>30 wt.%) and positive organic carbon and negative nitrogen isotopic excursions. In turn, high levels of primary productivity induced intense water-column anoxia, facilitating preservation of organic matter. These findings underscore the potential influences of volcanism on ecological conditions, primary productivity, and carbon sequestration throughout geological history.

 Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is increasingly recognized as a non-destructive probe for tracking terrestrial photosynthesis. Emerging developments in spectral invariants theory provide an innovative and efficient approach for representing SIF radiative transfer processes at the canopy scale. However, modeling leaf-scale fluorescence based on the spectral invariants properties (SIP) remains underexplored. In this study, the spectral invariants theory is employed for the first time to model the leaf-scale total, backward and forward fluorescence (leaf-SIP SIF). The leaf-SIP SIF model separates the leaf-scale radiative transfer process into two distinct components: the wavelength-dependent one associated with leaf biochemical properties, and the wavelength-independent component linked to leaf structural characteristics. The leaf structure-related effects are characterized by two spectrally invariant parameters: the photon recollision probability (p) and the scattering asymmetry parameter (q), which are parameterized using the directly measurable leaf dry matter. Evaluation against field measurements shows that the proposed leaf-SIP SIF model has a good performance, with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89, 0.89, 0.90 and root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 1.28, 0.69, 0.74 Wm−2μm−1sr−1, respectively for the total, backward, and forward fluorescence (660–800 nm). The leaf-SIP SIF model with a more concise formulation demonstrates comparable performance with the widely used Fluspect model. The leaf-SIP SIF model provides a simple and efficient approach for simulating leaf-scale fluorescence, with the potential to be integrated into a unified SIP-based model framework for simulating the radiative transfer processes across the soil-leaf-canopy-atmosphere continuum."

 Topography alters both the incident radiation and radiative transfer (RT) processes within the canopy, leading to changes in the canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). Most traditional semi-physical terrain correction (TC) methods for vegetation canopy BRFs rely on simplifying physically-based analytical RT models. However, these analytical RT models are not comprehensively parameterized for all RT computations, leading to the neglect of crucial processes, such as multiple scattering processes during the derivation of semi-physical TC methods. The spectral invariants theory (p-theory) offers an efficient approach to model canopy BRFs by simplifying RT computations. We extended p-theory to sloping terrain, considering the variation of the terrain-induced incident radiation and RT processes, and developed a canopy BRF TC model, termed the p-C method. The p-C method applies not only to spectral bands with lower multiple scattering within the canopy (e.g., visible bands) but also to near-infrared (NIR) bands, where multiple scattering effects may be more pronounced than in the visible bands within the canopy. We used the three-dimensional RT model DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) to simulate BRFs of homogeneous, realistic canopies of the RAMI (RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison) experiment, and BRF images with real DEM (Digital Elevation Model) to evaluate the p-C method and to compare it with traditional empirical and semi-physical TC methods (CC, SCS, SCS+C, DS, PLC-S, and SE). The p-C method reduced the RMSE (root mean square error) by 67 %, 64 %, 64 %, 85 %, 83 %, and 54 % respectively over these methods. Furthermore, when applied to Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing BRF images, the p-C method effectively eliminated terrain texture, as confirmed by visual interpretation and the linear regression between the corrected BRF images and the local solar incidence angle. Currently, the p-C method only considers illuminated slopes, and corrections for shaded slopes need to be studied in the future."

 Accurate measurement of high-resolution snow depth (SD) is crucial for regional ecohydrology and climate studies. Passive microwave remote sensing is an effective technique for SD retrieval on global or regional scales. However, its low spatial resolution limits its application in various fields. Additionally, the complex effects of multiple factors in the microwave radiation process pose a significant challenge for accurate SD retrieval as SD increases. In this study, a high-resolution SD retrieval algorithm for passive microwave data was developed based on the linear unmixing method and machine learning (ML) stacking technique. Firstly, the 0.25° AMSR2 brightness temperature data were downscaled to 0.01° through linear unmixing. Then, combining the temporal and spatial features of the snowpack, the high-resolution SD was retrieved based on the ML stacking technique. This method combined the advantages of multiple base models for retrieving different depths of snow, which effectively improved the overall estimation performance of the algorithm. Compared with in situ observed SD at meteorological stations and field observation SD, the algorithm achieved an overall RMSE of 5.25 cm, which was lower than that of other coarse-resolution SD datasets and products, including the long-term series of daily SD dataset in China (7.40 cm), the ERA5-Land (9.71 cm), and JAXA AMSR2 Level 2 SD products (12.59 cm).

The method proposed herein leverages diverse data sources – including L8 optical imagery, S1 (C-band) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, PL (L-band) SAR imagery, and terrain features – to capture comprehensive information about fuel types and distributions. An ensemble model was trained to predict landscape-scale fuels – such as the ’Scott and Burgan 40’ – using the as-received Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field survey plot data obtained from the USDA Forest Service. However, this basic approach yielded relatively poor results due to the inadequate amount of training data. Pseudo-labeled and fully synthetic datasets were developed using generative AI approaches to address the limitations of ground truth data availability. These synthetic datasets were used for augmenting the FIA data from California to enhance the robustness and coverage of model training. The use of an ensemble of methods – including deep learning neural networks, decision trees, and gradient boosting – offered a fuel mapping accuracy of nearly 80%. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated for regions of the 2021 Dixie and Caldor fires. Comparative analyses against high-resolution data from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and timber harvest maps affirmed the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach, which is capable of near-real-time fuel mapping."

 Particulate matter (PM) is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the association between short-term PM exposure and CVD incidence among older adults remains unclear. We aimed to assess the impact of PM2.5 and PMcoarse on CVD risk and its specific types, including overall CVD, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke.We recruited 471,706 patients aged 65 years and older who were newly diagnosed with CVD between 2015 and 2021, using data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database in South Korea. PM concentrations, specifically those with diameters smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM10), were obtained from the National Ambient Air Monitoring System. The concentration of PMcoarse was calculated by subtracting PM2.5 from PM10. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CVD using conditional logistic regression.Compared to the lowest quartile of PM2.5, the highest quartile of lag0 (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.05) and lag0-1 (aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.04) had higher CVD risk. Similarly, the 4th quartile of lag0 (aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.04) and lag0-1 (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.03) had higher odds for CVD compared to the 1st quartile of PMcoarse. The highest quartile of lag0-1 for PM2.5 (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06) and PMcoarse (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.04) showed increased odds of coronary heart disease. For stroke, however, a significant increase in CVD risk was observed only for ischemic stroke, not hemorrhagic stroke.We found a significant dose-response relationship indicating that higher levels of short-term PM exposure were associated with an increased risk of CVD among older adults.

 Due to the large extent of seawater surface over the globe, aerosol particles spend significant time being transported over this type of surface. Therefore, global aerosol circulation is largely impacted by the processes particles undergo during long-range transport overseas. In this study, we investigated submicron aerosol (PM1) chemical composition changes during long-range transport events over the southern Baltic Sea across two sites in Sweden (Hyltemossa) and Lithuania (Preila). The chemical composition was determined simultaneously using mass spectroscopy (time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF-ACSM)) in Hyltemossa and quadrupole ACSM (Q-ACSM) in Preila and filter-based optical (AE33 in Hyltemossa and AE31in Preila) methods. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of long-range air mass transport over the sea on PM1 chemical composition at the two remote background sites in the southern Baltic Sea region. The campaign average PM1 concentration in Preila (11.2 μg/m3) was higher than in Hyltemossa (6.3 μg/m3). Yet, during long-range transport events, PM1 concentration in Preila, downwind, was 40% lower (2.5 μg/m3) than in Hyltemossa (4.3 μg/m3), upwind, suggesting aerosol removal and dilution processes over the sea. We used the meteorological and spatial parameters from backward trajectory analysis to categorise the long-range air mass transport events across the two sites. Then the combinations of dilution, wet and dry deposition, emissions over land and other processes were labelled as the sea transport effect, wet deposition processes and land-atmosphere interaction. The results showed that during the events when air mass trajectories stretched from west to east from over Hyltemossa to Preila without precipitation along the path, the PM1 concentration decreased on average by 50%. The addition of precipitation resulted in a larger decrease (70%) of PM1 concentration. However, during the events with precipitation when air mass trajectories passed over a continental area before arriving at the downwind site, the net decrease was the lowest (27%). The lowest relative change in PM1 concentration during those events suggests the potential uptake of pollutants into the air mass over land with more significant anthropogenic pollution sources. Our approach allows us to quantitively assess the mitigating effects of sea transport, wet deposition processes and the opposite effect when air mass is advected over land on PM1 concentration using the proposed classification based on meteorological and spatial parameters of HYSPLIT backward trajectories."

 The city of Urumqi experiences severe air pollution, for which the variations and causes remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively investigate the seasonality, trends, and drivers of fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10) and ozone (O3) in Urumqi in the Chinese national context by statistical analysis of surface and satellite observations during 2015–2023. Wintertime PM2.5 in Urumqi is twice as high as that averaged over Eastern China due to intensive emissions and unfavourable topography and meteorology, monthly PM2.5-10 in Urumqi of above 40 μg m−3 year-round is driven by spring and autumn natural dust episodes and ubiquitous anthropogenic fugitive dust. During 2015–2023, PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 decreased by 34–38% credited to emissions control. However, the maximum daily 8h average (MDA8) O3 in Urumqi increases rapidly at a rate of 2.5 ppbv yr−1 due to increased volatile organic compounds (VOCs), decreased nitrogen oxides (NOx) in earlier years of 2015–2016, and decreased PM2.5. Impacts from VOCs and NOx emission changes are supported by summertime O3 formation regime transits from VOCs-limited to NOx and VOCs co-limited during 2015–2023 as depicted by surface O3-nitrogen dioxide (NO2) correlations and satellite formaldehyde (HCHO)/NO2 ratios. Responses of PM2.5, PM2.5-10, O3, and related gases during the 2020 winter and summer epidemic lockdowns conform to our findings for their 2015–2023 trends. This study concludes that joint NOx and VOCs emissions control would be particularly effective in reducing PM2.5 and O3 in Urumqi.

 Black carbon (BC) is a highly absorbent aerosol that significantly impacts regional air quality, public health, and global climate change. In this study, we develop a machine learning-based stacking model to estimate hourly BC in China, using observational data from 36 BC sites of the China Atmosphere Watch Network (CAWNET) from 2020 to 2023. The stacking model shows strong robustness and high accuracy nationwide, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.79 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.60 μg/m3. Compared to Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP), the stacking model reduces bias by 33.8% in urban areas and 56.9% in rural areas. According to this model, the urban BC concentration is 48.5% higher than that in rural areas across China. North China Plain, Central China, and the Sichuan Basin continue to be the regions with the highest BC concentrations in China, with average concentrations of 1.73 ± 0.66 μg/m3, 1.61 ± 0.55 μg/m3, and 1.71 ± 0.58 μg/m3, respectively, from 2020 to 2023.

 During March 13–18, 2021, East Asia experienced the strongest dust storm in the last decade. This windblown dust event caused large-scale dispersion of aerosol pollution, and attracted widespread attention due to its severe impacts on land-atmosphere-marine ecosystems. Here we investigated the dust sources, transport, and deposition of this dust storm and its effects on the Asia-Pacific region by using ground observations, satellite remote sensing products, and numerical simulation. The results showed that the potential aeolian dust source was mainly located in the Gobi Desert in southern Mongolia and central Inner Mongolia. This dust storm generated rapid increases in ambient particle concentrations over northern and eastern China, the Korean peninsula, and southwestern Japan. Air quality in 82% of the studied East Asian cities deteriorated noticeably as a result of mineral dust intensification. The ground-based Mie-scattering lidar detected the long-distance dispersion of dust aerosols in the 3–5 km high altitudes over Seoul, Osaka, Tokyo, and Niigata. Approximately 16.1 Tg of floating dust was deposited in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. The intensity of dust deposition in the East China Sea was almost twice that in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. Satellite data revealed that dust particles transported remotely from the East Asian desert were deposited in the North Pacific, resulting in an evident increase (55%–86%) in regional chlorophyll-a concentrations within a week after this dust storm event. Marine algal blooms developed quickly in response to the joint effects of atmospheric dry or wet deposition and surface-ocean currents. This study quantitatively assessed the potential influences of this strong East Asian dust storm on the atmospheric and marine environment, providing a multi-angle perspective for investigating the dynamic long-range transport of aerosols and its implications for global dust cycles."

 Since the successful launch and operation of the FengYun-3E (FY-3E) satellite, the assessment of its data quality and applications has garnered significant attention. By comparison with previous studies focusing on the assessment on a single case, this research assimilates the Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2) and the Microwave Temperature Sounder-3 (MWTS-3) data to evaluate the track and intensity prediction of 19 tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific (WNP). This comprehensive investigation seeks to unravel the contributions of microwave radiance onboard FY-3E to the initial fields in the multi-typhoon predictions. For each TC case, three experiments are carried out to evaluate the effect of microwave radiance data on clear-sky assimilation: the control experiment (CONV) assimilates only conventional data, while the other two experiments incorporate MWHS-2 (MWHS) and MWTS-3 (MWTS) data, respectively. The results indicate that MWHS and MWTS exert distinct effects on dynamical and thermodynamic variables across various atmospheric levels. The positive impact of MWHS and MWTS on the track and intensity forecast has been proven, respectively, with the root mean square errors reduced by 3.86 % for track, 4.76 % for maximum wind speed (MWS), and 7.78 % for minimum surface level pressure (MSLP) relative to CONV. For the three-day average forecast errors, the MWHS exhibits the lowest daily mean track error, while the MWTS primarily contributes to reducing the MSLP error on the second day and the MWS error on the first and third days."

Changing the location of production to regions of lower water stress would alleviate current exceedances of water constraints; however, considering economic factors shows that this is not always feasible.

Sunlight induces substantial and consistent N2O production under oxic abiotic conditions in fresh and marine waters. We measured photochemical N2O production rates using isotope tracers and determined that nitrite is the main substrate and that nitrate can also contribute after being photoreduced to nitrite.

Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes."

Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate these immune responses by presenting luminal antigens to CD4+T cells and inducing their differentiation into regulatory (peripheral regulatory T cell) or inflammatory [T helper (Th) cell] subsets. We used a proximity labeling method (LIPSTIC) to identify APCs that presented dietary antigens under tolerizing and inflammatory conditions and to understand cellular mechanisms by which tolerance to food is induced and can be disrupted by infection. Helminth infections disrupted tolerance induction proportionally to the reduction in the ratio between tolerogenic APCs—including migratory dendritic cells (cDC1s) and Rorγt+APCs—and inflammatory APCs, which were primarily cDC2s. These inflammatory cDC2s expanded by helminth infection did not present dietary antigens, thus avoiding diet-specific Th2 responses."
