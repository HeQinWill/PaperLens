The experiments are designed with the goal of answering science policy questions related to fires. The options for the multi-model approach, including inputs, outputs, and model set up are discussed, and the official recommendations for the project are presented. 
 Open biomass burning has major impacts globally and regionally on atmospheric composition. Fire emissions include particulate matter, tropospheric ozone precursors, greenhouse gases, as well as persistent organic pollutants, mercury and other metals. Fire frequency, intensity, duration, and location are changing as the climate warms, and modelling these fires and their impacts is becoming more and more critical to inform climate adaptation and mitigation, as well as land management. Indeed, the air pollution from fires can reverse the progress made by emission controls on industry and transportation. At the same time, nearly all aspects of fire modelling – such as emissions, plume injection height, long-range transport, and plume chemistry – are highly uncertain. This paper outlines a multi-model, multi-pollutant, multi-regional study to improve the understanding of the uncertainties and variability in fire atmospheric science, models, and fires’ impacts, in addition to providing quantitative estimates of the air pollution and radiative impacts of biomass burning. Coordinated under the auspices of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution, the international atmospheric modelling and fire science communities are working towards the common goal of improving global fire modelling and using this multi-model experiment to provide estimates of fire pollution for impact studies. This paper outlines the research needs, opportunities, and options for the fire-focused multi-model experiments and provides guidance for these modelling experiments, outputs, and analysis that are to be pursued over the next 3 to 5 years. It proposes a plan for delivering specific products at key points over this period to meet important milestones relevant to science and policy audiences."

This may help understand why models produce varying amounts of sea ice in the present day. We find models tend to show more melt, growth or conduction for a given ice thickness than the buoys, though the difference is smaller for models with more physically realistic thermodynamics. 
 With the ongoing decline in Arctic sea ice extent, the accurate simulation of Arctic sea ice in coupled models remains an important problem in climate modelling. In this study, the substantial CMIP6 model spread in Arctic sea ice extent and volume is investigated using a novel, process-based approach. An observational dataset derived from the Arctic Ice Mass Balance buoy (IMB) network is used to evaluate the thermodynamic and mass balance diagnostics produced by a subset of CMIP6 models, to better understand the model processes that underlie the large-scale sea ice states. Due to the sparse nature of the IMB observations, the evaluation is performed by comparing distributions of modelled and observed fluxes in the densely sampled regions of the North Pole and Beaufort Sea."

Do;Sabine Griessbach;Patrick Jöckel;Domenico Taraborrelli,The MESSy DWARF (based on MESSy v2.55.2),"This article introduces the MESSy DWARF. Usually, the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) is linked to full dynamical models to build chemistry climate models. However, due to the modular concept of MESSy, and the newly developed DWARF component, it is now possible to create simplified models containing just one or some process descriptions. This renders very useful for technical optimisation (e.g., GPU porting) and can be used to create less complex models, e.g., a chemical box model. 
 Adaptation of Earth system model (ESM) codes to modern computing architectures is challenging, as ESMs consist of a multitude of different components. Historically grown and developed by scientists rather than software engineers, the codes of the individual components are often interwoven, making the optimisation of the ESMs on modern computing architectures rather challenging, if not impossible."

Raj;Puna Ram Sinha;Rohit Srivastava;Srinivas Bikkina;Damu Bala Subrahamanyam,AeroMix v1.0.1: a Python package for modeling aerosol optical properties and mixing states,"A Python successor to the aerosol module of the OPAC model, named AeroMix, has been developed, with enhanced capabilities to better represent real atmospheric aerosol mixing scenarios. AeroMix’s performance in modeling aerosol mixing states has been evaluated against field measurements, substantiating its potential as a versatile aerosol optical model framework for next-generation algorithms to infer aerosol mixing states and chemical composition. 
 Assessing aerosol mixing states, which primarily depend on aerosol chemical compositions, is indispensable to estimate direct and indirect effects of aerosols. The limitations of the direct measurements of aerosol chemical composition and mixing states necessitate modeling approaches to infer the aerosol mixing states. The Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) model has been extensively utilized to construct optically equivalent aerosol chemical compositions from measured aerosol optical properties using Mie inversion. However, the representation of real atmospheric aerosol mixing scenarios in OPAC has perennially been challenged by the exclusive assumption of external mixing. A Python successor to the aerosol module of the OPAC model is developed, named AeroMix, with novel capabilities to (1) model externally and core–shell mixed aerosols, (2) simulate optical properties of aerosol mixtures constituted by any number of aerosol components, and (3) define aerosol composition and relative humidity in up to six vertical layers. Designed as a versatile open-source aerosol optical model framework, AeroMix is tailored for sophisticated inversion algorithms aimed at modeling aerosol mixing states and also their physical and chemical properties. AeroMix's performance is demonstrated by modeling the probable aerosol mixing states over Kanpur (urban) and the Bay of Bengal (marine) in south Asia. The modeled mixing states are consistent with independent measurements using a single-particle soot photometer (SP2) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), substantiating the potential capability of AeroMix to model complex aerosol mixing scenarios involving multiple internally mixed components in diverse environments. This work contributes a valuable tool for modeling aerosol mixing states to assess their impact on cloud-nucleating properties and radiation budget."

The deep-learning model can serve as the cloud parameterization within reanalysis frameworks, offering insights into improving the simulation of low clouds. By quantifying biases due to various meteorological factors and parameterizations, this deep-learning-driven approach helps bridge the observation–modeling divide. 
 Based on long-term observations at the Southern Great Plains site by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program for training and validation, a deep-learning model is developed to simulate the daytime evolution of boundary layer clouds (BLCs) from the perspective of land–atmosphere coupling. The model takes ARM measurements (including early-morning soundings and diurnally varying surface meteorological conditions and heat fluxes) as inputs and predicts hourly estimates (including cloud occurrence, the positions of cloud boundaries, and the vertical profile of the cloud fraction) as outputs. The deep-learning model offers good agreement with the observed cloud fields, especially in the accuracy with which cloud occurrence and base height are reproduced. When the inputs are substituted by reanalysis data from ERA5 and MERRA-2, the outputs of the deep-learning model provide a better agreement with observation than the cloud fields extracted from ERA5 and MERRA-2 themselves. Thus, the deep-learning model shows great potential to serve as a diagnostic tool for the performance of physics-based models in simulating stratiform and cumulus clouds. By quantifying biases in clouds and attributing them to the simulated atmospheric state variables versus the model-parameterized cloud processes, this observation-based deep-learning model may offer insights into the directions needed to improve the simulation of BLCs in physics-based models for weather forecasting and climate prediction."

Reich;Zhiyi Zhao;Yanqing Zhou,Quantifying the role of ozone-caused damage to vegetation in the Earth system: a new parameterization scheme for photosynthetic and stomatal responses,"A new scheme is developed to model the surface ozone damage to vegetation in regional and global process-based models. Based on 4210 data points from ozone experiments, it accurately reproduces statistically significant linear or nonlinear photosynthetic and stomatal responses to ozone in observations for all vegetation types. It also enables models to implicitly capture the variability in plant ozone tolerance and the shift among species within a vegetation type. 
 Surface ozone (O3) is the primary air pollutant threatening global vegetation. It typically reduces the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, leading to changes in carbon, water, and energy cycles; vegetation structure and composition; and climate. Several parameterization schemes have been developed to integrate the photosynthetic and stomatal responses to O3 exposure in regional and global process-based models to simulate time- and space-varying O3 plant damage and its cascading dynamic influence. However, these schemes are calibrated based on limited observations and often fail to reproduce the response relationships in observations, impeding accurate assessments of the role of O3 plant damage in the Earth system. This study proposes a new parameterization scheme to utilize the extensive observations from O3 fumigation experiments to inform large-scale modeling. It is built on 4210 paired data points of photosynthetic and stomatal responses compiled from the peer-reviewed literature, more than 6 times larger than those employed in earlier schemes. Functions of phytotoxic O3 dose (POD) are found to accurately reproduce the statistically significant linear or nonlinear relationships observed between POD and either relative leaf photosynthetic rate or relative stomatal conductance for needleleaf trees, broadleaf trees, shrubs, grasses, and crops. These eliminate the practice in earlier schemes of setting response functions as constants and applying the response function from one vegetation type to another. It outperforms the old scheme in the Community Land Model (CLM), which skillfully reproduces the observed response for crop photosynthetic rate only. The nonlinear response functions we developed depict decreasing plant sensitivity with increases in POD, enabling models to implicitly capture the variability in plant ozone tolerance and the shift among plant species for both intra- and inter-PFTs (plant functional types) within a vegetation type observed in the real world. Then, the new scheme is incorporated into the Community Earth System Model version 2.2 (CESM2.2), specifically its land component CLM5, to quantify the global impacts of present-day O3 plant damage by comparing the simulations with and without O3 plant damage. Results show that O3 exposure reduces the global leaf photosynthetic rate by 8.5 % and stomatal conductance by 7.4 %, around half the estimates using the old scheme. Furthermore, the new scheme improves global gross primary productivity (GPP) simulations, decreasing RMSE by 11.1 % relative to simulations without O3 plant damage and by 11.7 % compared to the old scheme. These results underscore the importance of including O3 plant damage in large-scale process-based models and the effectiveness of the new scheme in assessing and projecting globally the role of O3 plant damage in the Earth system."

The data are derived from low light imaging data collected nightly by the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day / night band (DNB). The form of the structures only becomes apparent when data from one or more years are accumulated. Identifiable structures include fishing grounds, platforms, gas flares, anchorages, and transportation routes. 
 We present the first comprehensive multiyear global mapping of offshore lighting structures derived from low-light imaging satellite observations collected at night. The sensor is the day/night band (DNB) flown as part of the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The product merges two operational nighttime light products: VIIRS boat detection (VBD) data and VIIRS cloud-free nighttime lights (VNL). The two products are spatially complementary, making it possible to fill gaps through a merger. Both product sets have an average DNB radiance layer, and the merger involves preserving the higher of the two average radiances. A wide range of lighting structures are present, from fishing grounds, platforms, anchorages, gas flares, transit routes, and the glow surrounding bright lighting onshore. The richness in the numbers and types of offshore lighting structures traces back to the DNB spike detector at the core of the VBD algorithm. The VNL algorithm uses outlier removal to filter out biomass burning, an essential process for mapping electric lighting onshore. The outlier removal drops about 80 % of the offshore lighting detections. We expect the new product will lead to an improved understanding of fishing grounds, offshore light pollution, and supply chain disruptions at anchorages, thereby aiding in the development of more sustainable and efficient practices."

In this study, we develop a novel algorithm to infer ocean subsurface temperature and salinity using satellite observations of ocean surface properties. The algorithm proposed is efficient, interpretable and widely applicable. The resultant dataset has a global coverage with a high spatial resolution (0.25°x0.25°) and has been validated against in-situ observations with satisfactory accuracy. 
 In-situ measurements of ocean temperature and salinity are critical to ocean-related studies but are limited in space and time. Satellite retrievals provide high-resolution, globally-covered sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS) and cannot directly measure the subsurface information., and height (SSH), but are limited to the ocean surface and cannot directly measure the subsurface information. Here we design a physics-informed algorithm that can reconstruct the vertical distributions of upper ocean temperature and salinity based purely on satellite observations. The algorithm stresses the tight ocean surface-subsurface coupling and the co-variability of ocean temperature and salinity. It is firstly tested with climate model simulations and then validated with actual observations by Argo floats, moored buoys and multiple ocean reanalysis datasets. The resultant satellite-based upper ocean temperature and salinity dataset has a global coverage, a high spatial resolution, and resolves ocean thermohaline structure from surface to 400 m. This dataset complements existing ocean subsurface products as an independent satellite-based observational dataset. The success of our reconstruction algorithm highlights a pressing need to maintain and advance the satellite observations of SST, SSS, and SSH. The reconstructed ocean temperature and salinity dataset can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13145129 (Liu, 2024) and be used by researchers to study mesoscale ocean phenomena, assess the ocean heat content in various sea areas and etc."

However, global LIA knowledge is still lacking. This study generated the first global 500 m LIA products by gap-filling LIA measurement data. The global LIA is 41.47°±9.55° and increases with latitude. The LIA products would enhance our understanding of global LIA and assist remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies. 
 Leaf inclination angle (LIA), the angle between leaf surface normal and zenith directions, is a vital parameter in radiative transfer, rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and hydrological processes. Due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale field measurement data, LIA is typically assumed to follow the spherical leaf distribution or simply considered constant for different plant types. However, the appropriateness of these simplifications and the global LIA distribution are still unknown. This study compiled global LIA measurements and generated the first global 500 m mean LIA (MLA) product by gap-filling the LIA measurement data using a random forest regressor. Different generation strategies were employed for noncrops and crops. The MLA product was evaluated by validating the nadir leaf projection function (G(0)) derived from the MLA product with high-resolution reference data. The global MLA is 41.47°±9.55°, and the value increases with latitude. The MLAs for different vegetation types follow the order of cereal crops (54.65°) > broadleaf crops (52.35°) > deciduous needleleaf forest (50.05°) > shrubland (49.23°) > evergreen needleleaf forest (47.13°) ≈ grassland (47.12°) > deciduous broadleaf forest (41.23°) > evergreen broadleaf forest (34.40°). Cross-validation shows that the predicted MLA presents a medium consistency (r = 0.75, RMSE = 7.15°) with the validation samples for noncrops, whereas crops show relatively lower correspondence (r = 0.48 and 0.60 for broadleaf crops and cereal crops) because of limited LIA measurements and strong seasonality. The global G(0) distribution is opposite to that of the MLA and agrees moderately with the reference data (r = 0.62, RMSE = 0.15). This study shows that the common spherical and constant LIA assumptions may underestimate the intercept capability for most vegetation. The MLA and G(0) products derived in this study would enhance our knowledge about global LIA and should greatly facilitate remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies."

Using machine learning and environmental data, it reconstructs sea surface CO2 levels from 1993–2021. The product accurately captures seasonal cycles, regional variations, and long-term trends, outperforming earlier attempts. It provides crucial data for studying coastal carbon dynamics and climate change impacts. 
 Insufficient spatiotemporal coverage of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) observations has hindered precise studies of the coastal carbon cycle along the North American Atlantic Coastal Ocean Margin (NAACOM). Earlier pCO2-products have encountered difficulties in accurately capturing the heterogeneity of regional variations and decadal trends of pCO2 in the NAACOM. This study developed a regional reconstructed pCO2-product for the NAACOM (Reconstructed Coastal Acidification Database-pCO2, or ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2) using a two-step approach combining random forest regression and linear regression. The product provides monthly pCO2 data at 0.25° spatial resolution from 1993 to 2021, enabling investigation of regional spatial differences, seasonal cycles, and decadal changes in pCO2. The observation-based reconstruction was trained using Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) observations as ground-truth values, with various satellite-derived and reanalysis environmental variables known to control sea surface pCO2 as model inputs. The product shows high accuracy during the model training, validation, and independent test phases, demonstrating robustness and capability to accurately reconstruct pCO2 in regions or periods lacking direct observational data in the NAACOM. Compared with all the observation samples from SOCAT, the pCO2-product yields a determination coefficient of 0.83, a root-mean-square error of 18.64 µatm, and an accumulative uncertainty of 23.83 µatm. The ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2 product demonstrates its capability to resolve seasonal cycles, regional-scale variations, and decadal linear trends of pCO2 along the NAACOM. This new product provides reliable pCO2 data for more precise studies of coastal carbon dynamics in the NAACOM region.

This program collected 700 d of measurements under different latitudes, seasons, sea states, and weather conditions. These new data will support the calibration and validation of numerical models and the understanding of the atmospheric composition of this region of Earth. 
 This article is devoted to the presentation of the MAP-IO observation program. This program, launched in early 2021, has enabled the observation of nearly 700 d of measurements over the Indian and Southern Ocean with the equipment of 17 meteorological and oceanographic scientific instruments on board the ship Marion Dufresne. Several observational techniques have been developed to respond to the difficulties of observations on board the ship, in particular for passive remote sensing data, as well as for quasi-autonomous data acquisition and transfer. The first measurements made it possible to draw up unprecedented climatological data of the Southern Ocean regarding the size distribution and optical thickness of aerosols, the concentration of trace gases and greenhouse gases, UV, and integrated water vapor. High-resolution observations of phytoplankton in surface waters have also shown a great variability in latitude in terms of abundance and community structure (diversity). The operational success of this program and these unique scientific results together establish a proof of concept and underline the need to transform this program into a permanent observatory. The multi-year rotations over the Indian Ocean will enable us to assess the trends and seasonal variability of phytoplankton, greenhouse gases, ozone, and marine aerosols in a sensitive and poorly documented climatic region. Without being exhaustive, MAP-IO should make it possible to better understand and assess the biological carbon pump, to study the variability of gases and aerosols in a region that is remote in relation to the main anthropogenic sources, and to monitor the transport of stratospheric ozone by the Brewer–Dobson circulation.

It is the first attempt to synergistically estimate all-weather instantaneous and daily mean LST data on a long  global-scale time series. The generated datasets were evaluated by the observations from in situ stations and other LST datasets, and the evaluation indicated that the dataset is sufficiently reliable. 
 Land surface temperature (LST) serves as a crucial variable in characterizing climatological, agricultural, ecological, and hydrological processes. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing provides high temporal and spatial resolutions for obtaining LST information. Nevertheless, TIR-based satellite LST products frequently exhibit missing values due to cloud interference. Prior research on estimating all-weather instantaneous LST has predominantly concentrated on regional or continental scales. This study involved generating a global all-weather instantaneous and daily mean LST product spanning from 2000 to 2020 using XGBoost. Multisource data, including Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations, surface radiation products, and reanalysis data, were employed. Validation using an independent dataset of 77 individual stations demonstrated the high accuracy of our products, yielding root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.787 K (instantaneous) and 2.175 K (daily). The RMSE for clear-sky conditions was 2.614 K for the instantaneous product, which is slightly lower than the cloudy-sky RMSE of 2.931 K. Our instantaneous and daily mean LST products exhibit higher accuracy compared to the MODIS official LST product (instantaneous RMSE = 3.583 K; daily 3.105 K) and the land component of the fifth generation of the European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) LST product (instantaneous RMSE = 4.048 K; daily 2.988 K). Significant improvements are observed in our LST product, notably at high latitudes, compared to the official MODIS LST product.

Fu,Retrieving ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in China (2013–2021) with a numerical-model-informed testbed to mitigate sample-imbalance-induced biases,"Surface PM2.5 data have gained widespread application in health assessments and related fields, while the inherent uncertainties in PM2.5 data persist due to the lack of ground-truth data across the space. This study provides a novel testbed, enabling comprehensive evaluation across the entire spatial domain. The optimized deep-learning model with spatiotemporal features successfully retrieved surface PM2.5 concentrations in China (2013–2021), with reduced biases induced by sample imbalance. 
 Ground-level PM2.5 data derived from satellites with machine learning are crucial for health and climate assessments. However, uncertainties persist due to the absence of spatially covered observations. To address this, we propose a novel testbed using nontraditional numerical simulations to evaluate PM2.5 estimation across the entire spatial domain. The testbed emulates the general machine-learning approach by training the model with grids corresponding to ground monitoring sites and subsequently testing its predictive accuracy for other locations. Our approach enables comprehensive evaluation of various machine-learning methods' performance in estimating PM2.5 across the spatial domain for the first time. Unexpected results are shown in the application in China, with larger absolute PM2.5 biases found in densely populated regions with abundant ground observations across all benchmark models due to the higher baseline concentration, though the relative error (approximately 20 %) is smaller compared to that in rural areas (over 50 %). The imbalance in training samples, mostly from urban areas with high emissions, is the main reason, leading to significant overestimation due to the lack of monitors in downwind areas where PM2.5 is transported from urban areas with varying vertical profiles. Our proposed testbed also provides an efficient strategy for optimizing model structure or training samples to enhance satellite-retrieval model performance. Integration of spatiotemporal features, especially with conventional neural network (CNN)-based deep-learning approaches like the residual neural network (ResNet) model, has successfully mitigated PM2.5 overestimation (by 5–30 µg m−3) and the corresponding exposure (by 3 million people ⋅ µg m−3) in the downwind area over 9 years (2013–2021) compared to the traditional approach. Furthermore, the incorporation of 600 strategically positioned ground monitoring sites identified through the testbed is essential for achieving a more balanced distribution of training samples, thereby ensuring precise PM2.5 estimation and facilitating the assessment of the associated impacts in China. In addition to presenting the retrieved surface PM2.5 concentrations in China from 2013 to 2021, this study provides a testbed dataset derived from physical modeling simulations which can serve to evaluate the performance of data-driven methodologies, such as machine learning, in estimating spatial PM2.5 concentrations for the community (Li et al., 2024a; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11122294)."

For key events, we analyse their predictability and drivers and attribute them to climate change and land use. We provide a seasonal outlook and decadal projections. Key anomalies occurred in Canada, Greece, and western Amazonia, with other high-impact events catalogued worldwide. Climate change significantly increased the likelihood of extreme fires, and mitigation is required to lessen future risk. 
 Climate change contributes to the increased frequency and intensity of wildfires globally, with significant impacts on society and the environment. However, our understanding of the global distribution of extreme fires remains skewed, primarily influenced by media coverage and regionalised research efforts. This inaugural State of Wildfires report systematically analyses fire activity worldwide, identifying extreme events from the March 2023–February 2024 fire season. We assess the causes, predictability, and attribution of these events to climate change and land use and forecast future risks under different climate scenarios. During the 2023–2024 fire season, 3.9×106 km2 burned globally, slightly below the average of previous seasons, but fire carbon (C) emissions were 16 % above average, totalling 2.4 Pg C. Global fire C emissions were increased by record emissions in Canadian boreal forests (over 9 times the average) and reduced by low emissions from African savannahs. Notable events included record-breaking fire extent and emissions in Canada, the largest recorded wildfire in the European Union (Greece), drought-driven fires in western Amazonia and northern parts of South America, and deadly fires in Hawaii (100 deaths) and Chile (131 deaths). Over 232 000 people were evacuated in Canada alone, highlighting the severity of human impact. Our analyses revealed that multiple drivers were needed to cause areas of extreme fire activity. In Canada and Greece, a combination of high fire weather and an abundance of dry fuels increased the probability of fires, whereas burned area anomalies were weaker in regions with lower fuel loads and higher direct suppression, particularly in Canada. Fire weather prediction in Canada showed a mild anomalous signal 1 to 2 months in advance, whereas events in Greece and Amazonia had shorter predictability horizons. Attribution analyses indicated that modelled anomalies in burned area were up to 40 %, 18 %, and 50 % higher due to climate change in Canada, Greece, and western Amazonia during the 2023–2024 fire season, respectively. Meanwhile, the probability of extreme fire seasons of these magnitudes has increased significantly due to anthropogenic climate change, with a 2.9–3.6-fold increase in likelihood of high fire weather in Canada and a 20.0–28.5-fold increase in Amazonia. By the end of the century, events of similar magnitude to 2023 in Canada are projected to occur 6.3–10.8 times more frequently under a medium–high emission scenario (SSP370). This report represents our first annual effort to catalogue extreme wildfire events, explain their occurrence, and predict future risks. By consolidating state-of-the-art wildfire science and delivering key insights relevant to policymakers, disaster management services, firefighting agencies, and land managers, we aim to enhance society's resilience to wildfires and promote advances in preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation.

Our study demonstrates the potential of high-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) satellite to estimate ground-level PM concentrations using a machine learning model. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is the world's first ultraviolet–visible instrument for air quality monitoring in geostationary orbit. Since its launch in 2020, GEMS has provided hourly daytime air quality information over Asia. However, to date, validation and applications of these data are lacking. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of the first 1.5-year GEMS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data in estimating ground-level particulate matter (PM) concentrations at an hourly scale. To do so, we employ random forest models and use GEMS AOD data and meteorological variables as input features to estimate PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, respectively, in South Korea. The model-estimated PM concentrations are strongly correlated with ground measurements, but they exhibit negative biases, particularly during high aerosol loading months. Our results indicate that GEMS AOD values represent underestimates compared to ground-measured AOD values, possibly leading to negative biases in the final PM estimates. Further, we demonstrate that more training data could significantly improve random forest model performance, thus indicating the potential of GEMS for high-resolution surface PM prediction when sufficient data are accumulated over the coming years. Our results will serve as a reference to aid the evaluation of future GEMS AOD retrieval algorithm improvements and also provide initial guidance for data users."

Nagao;Kentaroh Suzuki;Makoto Kuji,Retrieving cloud base height and geometric thickness using the oxygen A-band channel of GCOM-C/SGLI,"In satellite remote sensing, estimating cloud base height (CBH) is more challenging than estimating cloud top height because the cloud base is obscured by the cloud itself. We developed an algorithm using the specific channel (known as the oxygen A-band channel) of the SGLI instrument on JAXA’s GCOM-C satellite to estimate CBH together with other cloud properties. This algorithm can provide global distributions of CBH across various cloud types, including liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds. 
 Measurements with a 763 nm channel, located within the oxygen A-band and equipped on the Second-generation Global Imager (SGLI) onboard the JAXA’s Global Change Observation Mission – Climate (GCOM-C) satellite, have the potential to retrieve cloud base height (CBH) and cloud geometric thickness (CGT) through passive remote sensing. This study implemented an algorithm to retrieve the CBH using the SGLI 763 nm channel in combination with several other SGLI channels in the visible, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared regions. In addition to CBH, the algorithm can simultaneously retrieve other key cloud properties, including cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius, ice COT fraction as the cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud top height (CTH), and CGT. Moreover, the algorithm can be seamlessly applied to global clouds comprised of liquid, ice, and mixed phases. The SGLI-retrieved CBH exhibited quantitative consistency with CBH data obtained from the ground-based ceilometer network, ship-borne ceilometer, satellite-borne radar and lidar observations, as evidenced by sufficiently high correlations and small biases. These results provide practical evidence that the retrieval of CBH is indeed possible using the SGLI 763 nm channel. Moreover, the results lend credence to the future use of SGLI CBH data, including the estimation of the surface downward longwave radiative flux from clouds. Nevertheless, issues remain that must be addressed to enhance the value of SGLI-derived cloud retrieval products. These include the systematic bias of SGLI CTH related to cirrus clouds and the bias of SGLI CBH caused by multi-layer clouds."

The results uncovered three factors that influence calibration performance: calibration period, concentration range, and time averaging. We developed a comprehensive framework for the best sensor calibration practices, which serves as a valuable reference for calibrating various sensor types used in air quality monitoring. 
 The rapid expansion of low-cost sensor networks for air quality monitoring necessitates rigorous calibration to ensure data accuracy. Despite numerous published field calibration studies, a universal and comprehensive assessment of factors affecting sensor calibration remains elusive, leading to potential discrepancies in data quality across different networks. To address these challenges, this study deployed eight sensor-based monitors equipped with electrochemical sensors for NO2, NO, CO, and O3 measurement in strategically chosen locations within Hong Kong, Macau, and Shanghai, covering a wide range of climatic conditions: Hong Kong's subtropical climate, Macau's similar yet distinct urban environment, and Shanghai's more variable climate. This strategic deployment ensured that the sensors' performance and calibration processes were tested across diverse atmospheric conditions. Each monitor employed a patented dynamic baseline tracking method for the gas sensors, which isolates the concentration signals from temperature and humidity effects, enhancing the sensors' accuracy and reliability. The tests, which involved evaluating the validation performance by analyzing randomly selected calibration sample subsets ranging from 1 to 15 days, indicated that the length of the calibration period, pollutant concentration range, and time averaging period are pivotal for sensor calibration quality. We determined that a 5–7 days calibration period minimizes calibration coefficient errors, and a wider concentration range improves the validation R2 values for all sensors, suggesting the necessity of setting specific concentration range thresholds. Moreover, a time averaging period of at least 5 minutes for data with 1-minute resolution was recommended to enable optimal calibration in field operation. This study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive calibration assessment and the importance of considering environmental variability in sensor calibration condition. These findings offer methodological guidance for the calibration of other sensor types, providing a reference for future research in the field of sensor calibration."

 In recent years, the application of compact and cost-effective deployable X-band polarimetric radars has gained in popularity, particularly in regions with complex terrain. The deployable radars generally use a radome constructed by joining multiple panels using metallic threads to facilitate easy transportation. As a part of the ESPOIRS project, Laboratoire de l’Atmosphère et des Cyclones has acquired an X-band meteorological radar with four panel radome configuration. In this study, we investigated the effect of the radome on the measured polarimetric variables, particularly differential reflectivity and differential phase. Our observations reveal that the metallic threads connecting the radome panels introduce power loss at vertical polarization, leading to a positive bias in the differential reflectivity values. To address the spatial variability bias observed in differential reflectivity and differential phase, we have developed a novel algorithm based on the Discrete Fourier Transform. The algorithm's performance was tested during an intense heavy rainfall event caused by the Batsirai cyclone on Reunion Island. The comparative and joint histogram analysis demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in correcting the spatial bias in the polarimetric variables."

Both models can provide a good match to measurements from airborne radiometers and are sufficiently accurate for use with ICI. 
 Accurate gas absorption models at millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths are required to make best use of observations from instruments on board the next generation of EUMETSAT polar-orbiting weather satellites, including the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI), which measures at frequencies up to 664 GHz. In this study, airborne observations of clear-sky scenes between 89 and 664 GHz are used to perform radiative closure calculations for both upward- and downward-looking viewing directions in order to evaluate two state-of-the-art absorption models, both of which are integrated into the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS). Differences of 20 K are seen in some individual comparisons, with the largest discrepancies occurring where the brightness temperature is highly sensitive to the atmospheric water vapour profile. However, these differences are within the expected uncertainty due to the observed water vapour variability, highlighting the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of water vapour when performing such comparisons. The errors can be significantly reduced by averaging across multiple flights, which reduces the impact of uncertainties in individual atmospheric profiles. For upward-looking views, which have the greatest sensitivity to the absorption model, the mean differences between observed and simulated brightness temperatures are generally close to, or within, the estimated spectroscopic uncertainty. For downward-looking views, which more closely match the satellite viewing geometry, the mean differences were generally less than 1.5 K, with the exception of window channels at 89 and 157 GHz, which are significantly influenced by surface properties. These results suggest that both of the absorption models considered are sufficiently accurate for use with ICI."

To improve the accuracy of this wind measurement and to evaluate this improvement, we conducted experiments with the drones in a wind tunnel under various conditions. This wind tunnel can generate different kinds and intensities of wind. Here we measured with the drones and with other sensors as a reference and compared the results. We were able to improve our wind measurement and show how accurately it works in different situations. 
 As a contribution to closing observational gaps in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), the Simultaneous Wind measurement with Uncrewed Flight Systems in 3D (SWUF-3D) fleet of uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) is utilized for in situ measurements of turbulence. To date, the coefficients for the transformation terms used in our algorithm for deriving wind speeds from avionic data have only been determined via calibration flights in the free field. Therefore, we present in this work calibration and verification under laboratory conditions. The UAS measurements are performed in a wind tunnel equipped with an active grid and constant temperature anemometers (CTAs) as a reference. Calibration is performed in x- and y-coordinate directions of the UAS body frame at wind speeds of 2 … 18 m s−1. For systematic verification of the measurement capabilities and identification of limitations, different measurement scenarios like gusts, velocity steps, and turbulence are generated with the active grid. Furthermore, the measurement accuracy under different angles of sideslip (AoSs) and wind speeds is investigated, and we examined whether the calibration coefficients can be ported to other UASs in the fleet. Our analyses show that the uncertainty in measuring the wind speed depends on the wind speed magnitude and increases with extreme velocity changes and with higher wind speeds, resulting in a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 0.2 m s−1 for steady wind speeds. Applying the calibration coefficients from one UAS to others within the fleet results in comparable accuracies. Flights in gusts of different strengths yield an RMSE of up to 0.6 m s−1. The maximal RMSE occurs in the most extreme velocity steps (i.e., a lower speed of 5 m s−1 and an amplitude of 10 m s−1) and exceeds 1.3 m s−1. For variances below approx. 0.5 and 0.3 m2 s−2, the maximal resolvable frequencies of the turbulence are about 2 and 1 Hz, respectively. The results indicate successful calibration but with susceptibility to high AoSs in high wind speeds, no necessity for wind tunnel calibration for individual UASs, and the need for further research regarding turbulence analysis."

The enhancement varied multiple dimensional factors, emphasizing the complexity of temperature inside of OFR. The effects of temperature on the flow field and gas- or particle-phase reaction inside OFR were also evaluated with experiments and model simulations. Finally, multiple mitigation strategies were demonstrated to minimize this temperature increase. 
 Oxidation flow reactors (OFRs) have been extensively utilized to examine the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). However, the UV lamps typically employed to initiate the photochemistry in OFRs can result in an elevated reactor temperature when their implications are not thoroughly evaluated. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the temperature distribution within an Aerodyne potential aerosol mass OFR (PAM-OFR) and then examined the subsequent effects on flow and chemistry due to lamp heating. A lamp-induced temperature increase was observed, which was a function of lamp-driving voltage, number of lamps, lamp types, OFR residence time, and positions within the PAM-OFR. Under typical PAM-OFR operational conditions (e.g., < 5 d of equivalent atmospheric OH exposure under low-NOx conditions), the temperature increase typically ranged from 1–5 °C. Under extreme (but less frequently encountered) conditions, the heating could reach up to 15 °C. The influences of the increased temperature over ambient conditions on the flow distribution, gas, and condensed-phase chemistry within PAM-OFR were evaluated. Our findings indicate that the increase in temperature altered the flow field, resulting in a diminished tail on the residence time distribution and corresponding oxidant exposure due to faster recirculation. According to simulation results from a radical chemistry box model, the variation in absolute oxidant concentration within PAM-OFR due to temperature increase was minimal (< 5 %). The temperature influences on seed organic aerosol (OA) and newly formed secondary OA were also investigated, suggesting that an increase in temperature can impact the yield, size, and oxidation levels of representative biogenic and anthropogenic SOA types. Recommendations for  temperature-dependent SOA yield corrections and PAM-OFR operating protocols that mitigate lamp-induced temperature enhancement and fluctuations are  presented. We recommend blowing air around the reactor's exterior with fans during PAM-OFR experiments to minimize the temperature increase within  PAM-OFR. Temperature increases are substantially lower for OFRs utilizing less powerful lamps compared to the Aerodyne version."

 Ceilometers are used routinely at aerodromes worldwide to derive the height and sky coverage fraction of cloud layers. This information, possibly combined with direct observations by human observers, contributes to the production of meteorological aerodrome reports (METARs). Here, we present ampycloud, a new algorithm, and its associated Python package for automatic processing of ceilometer data with the aim of determining the sky coverage fraction and base height of cloud layers above aerodromes. The ampycloud algorithm was developed at the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss) as part of the AMAROC (AutoMETAR/AutoReport rOund the Clock) program to help in the fully automatic production of METARs at Swiss civil aerodromes. ampycloud is designed to work with no direct human supervision. The algorithm consists of three distinct, sequential steps that rely on agglomerative clustering methods and Gaussian mixture models to identify distinct cloud layers from individual cloud base hits reported by ceilometers. The robustness of the ampycloud algorithm stems from the first processing step, which is simple and reliable. It constrains the two subsequent processing steps that are more sensitive but also better suited to handling complex cloud distributions. The software implementation of the ampycloud algorithm takes the form of an eponymous, pip-installable Python package developed on GitHub and made publicly accessible."

A novel method is developed to define four phases of mixed-phase clouds. Relationships between cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties are quantified. Effects of aerosols and thermodynamic and dynamical conditions on ice nucleation and phase partitioning are examined. 
 The onset of ice nucleation in mixed-phase clouds determines the lifetime and microphysical properties of ice clouds. In this work, we develop a novel method that differentiates between various phases of mixed-phase clouds, such as clouds dominated by pure liquid or pure ice segments, compared with those having ice crystals surrounded by supercooled liquid water droplets or vice versa. Using this method, we examine the relationship between the macrophysical and microphysical properties of Southern Ocean mixed-phase clouds at −40 to 0 °C (e.g. stratiform and cumuliform clouds) based on the in situ aircraft-based observations during the US National Science Foundation Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) flight campaign. The results show that the exchange between supercooled liquid water and ice crystals from a macrophysical perspective, represented by the increasing spatial ratio of regions containing ice crystals relative to the total in-cloud region (defined as ice spatial ratio), is positively correlated with the phase exchange from a microphysical perspective, represented by the increasing ice water content (IWC), decreasing liquid water content (LWC), increasing ice mass fraction, and increasing ice particle number fraction (IPNF). The mass exchange between liquid and ice becomes more significant during phase 3 when pure ice cloud regions (ICRs) start to appear. Occurrence frequencies of cloud thermodynamic phases show a significant phase change from liquid to ice at a similar temperature (i.e. −17.5 °C) among three types of definitions of mixed-phase clouds based on ice spatial ratio, ice mass fraction, or IPNF. Aerosol indirect effects are quantified for different phases using number concentrations of aerosols greater than 100 or 500 nm (N>100 and N>500, respectively). N>500 shows stronger positive correlations with ice spatial ratios compared with N>100. This result indicates that larger aerosols potentially contain ice-nucleating particles (INPs), which facilitate the formation of ice crystals in mixed-phase clouds. The impact of N>500 is also more significant in phase 2 when ice crystals just start to appear in the mixed phase compared with phase 3 when pure ICRs have formed, possibly due to the competing aerosol indirect effects on primary and secondary ice production in phase 3. The thermodynamic and dynamic conditions are quantified for each phase. The results show stronger in-cloud turbulence and higher updraughts in phases 2 and 3 when liquid and ice coexist compared with pure liquid or ice (phases 1 and 4, respectively). The highest updraughts and turbulence are seen in phase 3 when supercooled liquid droplets are surrounded by ice crystals. These results indicate both updraughts and turbulence support the maintenance of supercooled liquid water amongst ice crystals. Overall, these results illustrate the varying effects of aerosols, thermodynamics, and dynamics through various stages of mixed-phase cloud evolution based on this new method that categorizes cloud phases."

In this study, we proposed the wide-field-of-view ultraviolet imager (WFUI) and built a forward model to evaluate the detection capability and efficiency. The results demonstrate that the WFUI performs well in PMC detection and has high detection efficiency. The relationship between ice water content and detection efficiency follows an exponential function distribution. 
 The variation trends and characteristics of polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) are important for studying the evolution of atmospheric systems and understanding various atmospheric dynamic processes. Through observation and analysis of PMCs, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving atmospheric processes, providing a scientific basis and support for addressing climate change. Ultraviolet (UV) imaging technology, adopted by the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite, has significantly advanced the research on PMCs. Due to the retirement of the AIM satellite, there is currently no concrete plan for next-generation instruments based on the CIPS model, resulting in a discontinuity in the observation data sequence.In this study, we propose a compact and cost-effective wide-field-of-view ultraviolet imager (WFUI) that can be integrated into various satellite platforms for future PMC observation missions. A forward model was built to evaluate the detection capability and efficiency of the WFUI. CIPS and Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) data were fused to reconstruct a three-dimensional PMC scene as the input background. Based on the scattering and extinction characteristics of ice particles and atmospheric molecules, the radiative transfer was calculated using the solar radiation path through the atmosphere and PMCs. The optical system and satellite platform parameters of the WFUI were selected according to CIPS, enabling the calculation of the number of photons received by the WFUI. The actual detection signal is then simulated by photoelectric conversion, and the PMC information can be obtained by removing detector noise. Subsequently, a comparison with the input background field was conducted to compute and analyze the detection efficiency. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the instrument and platform parameters was conducted.Simulations were performed for both individual orbits and for the entire PMC seasons. The research results demonstrate that the WFUI performs well in PMC detection and has high detection efficiency. Statistical analysis of the detection efficiency using data from 2008 to 2012 revealed an exponential relationship between the ice water content (IWC) of PMCs and detection efficiency. During the initial and final durations of the PMC season, when the IWC was relatively low, the detection efficiency remained limited. However, as the season progressed and the IWC increased, the detection efficiency significantly improved. We note that regions at lower latitudes exhibited a lower IWC and, consequently, lower detection efficiency. In contrast, regions at higher latitudes, with a greater IWC, demonstrated better detection efficiency. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis results suggest that increasing the satellite orbit altitude and expanding the field of view (FOV) of the WFUI both contribute to improving the detection efficiency."

Renewed interest in H2 as a low- or zero-carbon source of energy may lead to increased production, uses, and supply chain emissions. NOAA measurements of weekly air samples collected between 2009 and 2021 at over 50 sites in mostly remote locations are now available, and they complement other datasets to study the H2 global budget. 
 The NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) measures atmospheric hydrogen (H2) in grab samples collected weekly as flask pairs at over 50 sites in the Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network. Measurements representative of background air sampling show higher H2 in recent years at all latitudes. The marine boundary layer (MBL) global mean H2 was 552.8 ppb in 2021, 20.2 ± 0.2 ppb higher compared to 2010. A 10 ppb or more increase over the 2010–2021 average annual cycle was detected in 2016 for MBL zonal means in the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere. Carbon monoxide measurements in the same-air samples suggest large biomass burning events in different regions likely contributed to the observed interannual variability at different latitudes. The NOAA H2 measurements from 2009 to 2021 are now based on the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmospheric Watch (WMO GAW) H2 mole fraction calibration scale, developed and maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC), Jena, Germany. GML maintains eight H2 primary calibration standards to propagate the WMO scale. These are gravimetric hydrogen-in-air mixtures in electropolished stainless steel cylinders (Essex Industries, St. Louis, MO), which are stable for H2. These mixtures were calibrated at the MPI-BGC, the WMO Central Calibration Laboratory (CCL) for H2, in late 2020 and span the range 250–700 ppb. We have used the CCL assignments to propagate the WMO H2 calibration scale to NOAA air measurements performed using gas chromatography and helium pulse discharge detector instruments since 2009. To propagate the scale, NOAA uses a hierarchy of secondary and tertiary standards, which consist of high-pressure whole-air mixtures in aluminum cylinders, calibrated against the primary and secondary standards, respectively. Hydrogen at the parts per billion level has a tendency to increase in aluminum cylinders over time. We fit the calibration histories of these standards with zero-, first-, or second-order polynomial functions of time and use the time-dependent mole fraction assignments on the WMO scale to reprocess all tank air and flask air H2 measurement records. The robustness of the scale propagation over multiple years is evaluated with the regular analysis of target air cylinders and with long-term same-air measurement comparison efforts with WMO GAW partner laboratories. Long-term calibrated, globally distributed, and freely accessible measurements of H2 and other gases and isotopes continue to be essential to track and interpret regional and global changes in the atmosphere composition. The adoption of the WMO H2 calibration scale and subsequent reprocessing of NOAA atmospheric data constitute a significant improvement in the NOAA H2 measurement records."

A total of eight potentially unique events are analyzed, considering both the number and size of raindrops. However, no clear evidence supporting the existence of a special rainfall regime could be found. The results highlight the challenges in experimentally confirming well-established theoretical ideas in the field of precipitation sciences. 
 An experimental study aimed at identifying special rainfall regimes with the help of co-located disdrometers is performed. Eight potentially special events (i.e., four number-controlled events and four size-controlled events) are identified and examined. However, a detailed cross-check with additional, independent radar measurements reveals no clear evidence of special rainfall dynamics. The research underscores the difficulty of experimentally confirming seemingly straightforward questions about rainfall patterns and dynamics that have been theorized in the literature for several decades but never formally validated experimentally. The study also questions the reliability of previous claims and serves as a reminder to approach such problems with more caution, emphasizing the need for rigorous uncertainty analysis and multiple cross-checks between sensors to avoid misinterpretation."

We demonstrate our method by making measurements of the emissivity of water. We then compare our results to the emissivity predicted using a model and find good agreement. The observations from FINESSE are novel because they allow us to determine surface emissivity at longer wavelengths than have been routinely measured before. 
 In this paper, we describe a method for retrieving the surface emissivity of specular surfaces across the wavenumber range of 400–1600 cm−1 using novel radiance measurements of the Far-INfrarEd Spectrometer for Surface Emissivity (FINESSE) instrument. FINESSE is described in detail in Part 1 (Murray et al., 2024) of this paper. We apply the method to two sets of measurements of distilled water. The first set of emissivity retrievals is of distilled water heated above ambient temperature to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The second set of emissivity retrievals is of ambient temperate water at a range of viewing angles. In both cases, the observations agree well with calculations based on compiled refractive indices across the mid- and far-infrared. It is found that the reduced contrast between the up- and downwelling radiation in the ambient temperature case degrades the performance of the retrieval. Therefore, a filter is developed to target regions of high contrast, which improves the agreement between the ambient temperature emissivity retrieval and the predicted emissivity. These retrievals are, to the best of our knowledge, the first published simultaneous retrievals of the surface temperature and emissivity of water that extend into the far-infrared and demonstrate a method that can be used and further developed for the in situ retrieval of the emissivity of other surfaces in the field."

Polarization measurements are demonstrated to aid in the determination of snow grain shape, ice crystal roughness, and the vertical distribution of impurities in the snow–atmosphere system, data that are critical for estimating snow albedo for use in climate models. 
 This study presents a detailed theoretical assessment of the information content of passive polarimetric observations over snow scenes, using a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method. Conventional sensitivity studies focus on varying a single parameter while keeping all other parameters fixed. In contrast, the GSA correctly addresses the covariance of state parameters across their entire parameter space, hence favoring a more correct interpretation of inversion algorithms and the optimal design of their state vectors.The forward simulations exploit a vector radiative transfer model to obtain the Stokes vector emerging at the top of the atmosphere for different solar zenith angles, when the bottom boundary consists of a vertically resolved snowpack of non-spherical grains. The presence of light-absorbing particulates (LAPs), either embedded in the snow or aloft in the atmosphere above in the form of aerosols, is also considered. The results are presented for a set of wavelengths spanning the visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the spectrum.The GSA correctly captures the expected, high sensitivity of the reflectance to LAPs in the VIS–NIR and to grain size at different depths in the snowpack in the NIR–SWIR. With adequate viewing geometries, mono-angle measurements of total reflectance in the VIS–SWIR (akin to those of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) resolve grain size in the top layer of the snowpack sufficiently well. The addition of multi-angle polarimetric observations in the VIS–NIR provides information on grain shape and microscale roughness. The simultaneous sensitivity in the VIS–NIR to both aerosols and snow-embedded impurities can be disentangled by extending the spectral range to the SWIR, which contains information on aerosol optical depth while remaining essentially unaffected when the same particulates are mixed with the snow. Multi-angle polarimetric observations can therefore (i) effectively partition LAPs between the atmosphere and the surface, which represents a notorious challenge for snow remote sensing based on measurements of total reflectance only and (ii) lead to better estimates of grain shape and roughness and, in turn, the asymmetry parameter, which is critical for the determination of albedo. The retrieval uncertainties are minimized when the degree of linear polarization is used in place of the polarized reflectance.The Sobol indices, which are the main metric for the GSA, were used to select the state parameters in retrievals performed on data simulated for multiple instrument configurations. Improvements in retrieval quality with the addition of measurements of polarization, multi-angle views, and different spectral channels reflect the information content, identified by the Sobol indices, relative to each configuration.The results encourage the development of new remote sensing algorithms that fully leverage multi-angle and polarimetric capabilities of modern remote sensors. They can also aid flight planning activities, since the optimal exploitation of the information content of multi-angle measurements depends on the viewing geometry. The better characterization of surface and atmospheric parameters in snow-covered regions advances  research opportunities for scientists of the cryosphere and ultimately benefits albedo estimates in climate models."

 We report in-plume carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and carbon isotope ratios during the 2021 eruption of Tajogaite volcano, island of La Palma, Spain. CO2 measurements inform our understanding of volcanic contributions to the global climate carbon cycle and the role of CO2 in eruptions. Traditional ground-based methods of CO2 collection are difficult and dangerous, and as a result only about 5 % of volcanoes have been directly surveyed. We demonstrate that unpiloted aerial system (UAS) surveys allow for fast and relatively safe measurements. Using CO2 concentration profiles we estimate the total flux during several measurements in November 2021 to be 1.76±0.20×103 to 2.23±0.26×104 t d−1. Carbon isotope ratios of plume  CO2 indicate a deep magmatic source, consistent with the intensity of the eruption.

We performed calibrations on a NO3¯ ToFCIMS instrument to determine its sensitivity and linearity for detecting various organic compounds. Our findings revealed significant variability, over several orders of magnitude, in the calibration factors obtained. The results suggest that relying on a single calibration factor from H2SO4 for the quantification of all compounds detected by this technique is not appropriate. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a key role in tropospheric chemistry, giving rise to secondary products such as highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). HOMs, a group of low-volatility gas-phase products, are formed through the autoxidation process of peroxy radicals (RO2) originating from the oxidation of VOCs. The measurement of HOMs is made by a NO3- ToFCIMS instrument, which also detects other species like small highly oxygenated VOCs (e.g., dicarboxylic acids) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The instrument response to HOMs is typically estimated using H2SO4, as HOMs are neither commercially available nor easily synthesized in the laboratory. The resulting calibration factor is then applied to quantify all species detected using this technique. In this study, we explore the sensitivity of the instrument to commercially available small organic compounds, primarily dicarboxylic acids, given the limitations associated with producing known amounts of HOMs for calibration. We compare these single-compound calibration factors to the one obtained for H2SO4 under identical operational conditions. The study found that the sensitivity of the NO3- ToFCIMS varies depending on the specific type of organic compound, illustrating how a single calibration factor derived from sulfuric acid is clearly inadequate for quantifying all detected species using this technique. The results highlighted substantial variability in the calibration factors for the tested organic compounds, with 4-nitrocatechol exhibiting the highest sensitivity and pyruvic acid the lowest. The obtained sulfuric acid calibration factor agreed well with the previous values from the literature. In summary, this research emphasized the need to develop reliable and precise calibration methods for progressively oxygenated reaction products measured with a NO3- chemical-ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS), for example, HOMs."

 We assess the temperature stability requirements of unseeded Nd:YAG lasers in lidar systems for atmospheric temperature profiling through the rotational Raman technique. Taking as a reference a system using a seeded laser assumed to emit pulses of negligible spectral width and free of wavelength drifts, we estimate first the effect of the pulse spectral widening of the unseeded laser on the output of the interference filters, and then we derive the limits of the allowable wavelength drift for a given bias in the temperature measurement that would add to the noise-induced uncertainty. Finally, using spectroscopic data, we relate the allowable wavelength drift to allowable temperature variations in the YAG rod. We find that, in order to keep the bias affecting atmospheric temperature measurements smaller than 1 K, the Nd:YAG rod temperature should also be kept within  a variation range of 1 K."

The accuracy and linearization of rain rates can further improve the Gaussianity. 
 Given that the Gaussianity of the observation error distribution is the fundamental principle of some data assimilation and machine learning algorithms, the error structure of radar reflectivity has become increasingly important with the development of high-resolution forecasts and nowcasts of convective systems. This study examines the error distribution of radar reflectivity and discusses what causes the non-Gaussian error distribution using 6-month observations minus backgrounds (OmBs) of composites of vertical maximum reflectivity (CVMRs) in mountainous and hilly areas. By following the symmetric error model in all-sky satellite radiance assimilation, we reveal the error structure of CVMRs as a function of symmetric rain rates, which is the average of the observed and simulated rain rates. Unlike satellite radiance, the error structure of CVMRs shows a sharper slope for light precipitation than for moderate precipitation. Thus, a three-piecewise fitting function is more suitable for CVMRs. The probability density functions of OmBs normalized by symmetric rain rates become more Gaussian than the probability density functions normalized by all samples. Moreover, the possibility of using a third-party predictor to construct the symmetric error model is also discussed in this study. The result shows that the Gaussian distribution of OmBs can be further improved via more accurate precipitation observations. According to the Jensen–Shannon divergence, a more linear predictor, the logarithmic transformation of the rain rate, can provide the most Gaussian error distribution in comparison with other predictors."

Haywood,In-plume and out-of-plume analysis of  aerosol–cloud interactions derived from the   2014–2015 Holuhraun volcanic eruption,"Natural aerosols from volcanic eruptions can help us understand how anthropogenic aerosols modify climate. We use observations and model simulations of the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption plume to examine aerosol–cloud interactions in September 2014. We find a shift to clouds with smaller, more numerous cloud droplets in the first 2 weeks of the eruption. In the third week, the background meteorology and previous conditions experienced by air masses modulate the aerosol perturbation to clouds. 
 Aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) has persisted as the most uncertain aspect of anthropogenic forcing over the industrial period, limiting our ability to constrain estimates of climate sensitivity and to confidently predict 21st century climate change. Aerosol–cloud interactions are the most uncertain component of aerosol ERF. The 2014–2015 Holuhraun volcanic eruption acted as a large source of sulfur dioxide, providing an opportunistic experiment for studying aerosol–cloud interactions at a climatically relevant scale. We evaluate the observed aerosol-induced perturbation to marine liquid cloud properties inside the volcanic plume in the first month of the eruption and compare the results to those from UKESM1 (UK Earth System Model). In the first 2 weeks, as expected, we find an in-plume shift to smaller and more numerous cloud droplets in both the observations and the simulations. We find an observed increase in liquid water path (LWP) values inside the plume that is not captured in UKESM1. However, in the third week, the in-plume shift to smaller and more numerous cloud droplets is neither observed nor modelled, and there are discrepancies between the observed and modelled response in the fourth week. An analysis of the model simulations and trajectory modelling reveals that air mass history and background meteorological factors can strongly influence aerosol–cloud interactions between the weeks of our analysis. Overall, our study supports the findings of many previous studies: the aerosol impact on cloud effective radius is significant, with differences in the observed and modelled response for in-cloud LWP."

Harrison,Insights into the sources of ultrafine particle numbers at six European urban sites obtained by investigating COVID-19 lockdowns,"Different sources of airborne particles in the atmospheres of four European cities were distinguished by recognising their particle size distributions using a statistical procedure, positive matrix factorisation. The various sources responded differently to the changes in emissions associated with COVID-19 lockdowns, and the reasons are investigated. While traffic emissions generally decreased, particles formed from reactions of atmospheric gases decreased in some cities but increased in others. 
 Lockdown restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to the curtailment of many activities and reduced emissions of primary air pollutants. Here, we applied positive matrix factorisation  to particle size distribution (PSD) data from six monitoring sites (three urban background and three roadside) between four European cities (Helsinki, Leipzig, Budapest, and London) to evaluate how particle number concentrations (PNCs) and their sources changed during the respective 2020 lockdown periods compared to the reference years 2014–2019. A number of common factors were resolved between sites, including nucleation, road traffic semi-volatile fraction (road trafficsvf), road traffic solid fraction (road trafficsf), diffuse urban (wood smoke + aged traffic), ozone-associated secondary aerosol (O3-associated SA), and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA). Nucleation, road traffic, and diffuse urban factors were the largest contributors to mean PNCs during the reference years and respective lockdown periods. However, SIA factors were the largest contributors to particle mass concentrations, irrespective of environment type. Total mean PNCs were lower at two of the urban-background and all roadside sites during lockdown. The response of nucleation and road trafficsvf factors to lockdown restrictions was highly variable, although road trafficsf factors were consistently lower at roadside sites. The responses of diffuse urban factors were largely consistent and were mostly lower at urban-background sites. Secondary aerosols (O3-associated SA and SIA) exhibited extensive reductions in their mean PNCs at all sites. These variegated responses to lockdowns across Europe point to a complex network of sources and aerosol sinks contributing to PSDs."

We explored highly oxygenated organic molecule (HOM) formation from ∆3-carene ozonolysis in chambers and investigated the impact of temperature and relative humidity on HOM formation. Our findings provide new insights into ∆3-carene oxidation pathways and their potential to impact atmospheric aerosols. 
 Δ3-carene is a prominent monoterpene in the atmosphere, contributing significantly to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. However, knowledge about Δ3-carene oxidation pathways, particularly regarding their ability to form highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), is still limited. In this study, we present HOM measurements during Δ3-carene ozonolysis under various conditions in two simulation chambers. We identified numerous HOMs (monomers: C7−10H10−18O6−14; dimers: C17−20H24−34O6−18) using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS). Δ3-carene ozonolysis yielded higher HOM concentrations than α-pinene, with a distinct distribution, indicating differences in formation pathways. All HOM signals decreased considerably at lower temperatures, reducing the estimated molar HOM yield from ∼ 3 % at 20 °C to ∼ 0.5 % at 0 °C. Interestingly, the temperature change altered the HOM distribution, increasing the observed dimer-to-monomer ratios from roughly 0.8 at 20 °C to 1.5 at 0 °C. HOM monomers with six or seven O atoms condensed more efficiently onto particles at colder temperatures, while monomers with nine or more O atoms and all dimers condensed irreversibly even at 20 °C. Using the gas- and particle-phase chemistry kinetic multilayer model ADCHAM, we were also able to reproduce the experimentally observed HOM composition, yields, and temperature dependence."

The DCSs over the TP are less frequent, showing narrower and thinner cores and anvils compared to those over the TO. TP DCSs show a stronger longwave cloud radiative effect at the surface and in the low-level atmosphere. Distinct aerosol–cloud–precipitation interaction is found in TP DCSs, probably due to the cold cloud bases. 
 Using spaceborne lidar and radar observations, this study identifies deep convection systems (DCSs), including deep convection cores (DCCs) and anvils, over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and tropical Indian Ocean (TO) and finds that DCSs over the TP are less frequent, exhibiting narrower and thinner DCCs and anvils compared to those over the TO. The thinner DCCs over the TP exert weaker radiative cooling effects at the top of atmosphere (TOA) compared to the TO. But, the shortwave TOA cloud radiative effect (CRE) of TP anvils is stronger than that of the TO possibly due to more densely packed cloud tops over the TP. It results in a stronger TOA CRE of DCSs over the TP than that of TO. In particular, the longwave CRE of DCSs over the TP is notably greater at surface and low-level atmosphere due to the distinct lower temperature and less water vapour. The width of DCSs shows a positive correlation with wind shear and atmospheric instability, and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. We also find that the impact of aerosols on cloud top heights and precipitation displays significant discrepancies between the two regions. It is because that the aerosol invigoration effect is less efficient on the TP DCSs, mainly attributed to the significantly colder cloud base. Due to competition between invigoration and direct/semi-direct radiative effects of aerosols, the correlation between precipitation and aerosols over the TP is not obvious. However, precipitation in the TO experiences invigoration followed by suppression with increasing aerosols, due to the dominance of aerosol radiative effects and enhancement entrainment under polluted conditions."

The algorithm is mathematically proved, and its performance is shown for a carbon flux observing system simulation experiment. These results legitimize and generalize this algorithm's current use and make available this effective algorithm to new DA domains. 
 Through the Bayesian lens of four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation, uncertainty in model parameters is traditionally quantified through the posterior covariance matrix. However, in modern settings involving high-dimensional and computationally expensive forward models, posterior covariance knowledge must be relaxed to deterministic or stochastic approximations. In the carbon flux inversion literature, (Chevallier et al., 2007) proposed a stochastic method capable of approximating posterior variances of linear functionals of the model parameters that is particularly well suited for large-scale Earth-system 4D-Var data assimilation tasks. This note formalizes this algorithm and clarifies its properties. We provide a formal statement of the algorithm, demonstrate why it converges to the desired posterior variance quantity of interest, and provide additional uncertainty quantification allowing incorporation of the Monte Carlo sampling uncertainty into the method's Bayesian credible intervals. The methodology is demonstrated using toy simulations and a realistic carbon flux inversion observing system simulation experiment."

Observed results highlighted remarkably different aqueous processing of primary and secondary submicron aerosol components under distinct ambient relative humidity (RH) conditions and that RH levels significantly impact aerosol sampling through the aerosol swelling effect. 
 Aerosol hygroscopic growth and activation under high-relative-humidity (RH) conditions significantly influence the physicochemical properties of submicron aerosols (PM1). However, this process remains poorly characterized due to limited measurements. To address this gap, we deployed an advanced aerosol–fog sampling system that automatically switched between PM1, PM2.5 and total suspended particulate (TSP) inlets at a rural site in the North China Plain in the cold season. The results revealed that aerosol swelling due to water vapor uptake influenced aerosol sampling under high-RH conditions by shifting the cut-off size of impactors. At subsaturated high RH (> 90 %), over 25 % of aerosol mass with dry diameters below 1 µm resided in supermicron ranges, while in supersaturated foggy conditions, more than 70 % of submicron aerosol migrated to supermicron ranges. Hygroscopic growth and activation particularly affected highly hydrophilic inorganic salts,  shifting a significant number of submicron sulfate and nitrate particles to supermicron ranges, with 27 %–33 % at 95 % ≤ RH ≤ 99 % and more than 78 % under supersaturated foggy conditions. Moreover, more than 10 % of submicron biomass burning organic aerosols grew beyond 2.5 µm during fog events, while fossil-fuel-related organic aerosol (FFOA) remained dominantly in submicron ranges, suggesting inefficient aqueous conversion of FFOA. The two secondary organic aerosol (SOA) factors (OOA1 and OOA2) behaved differently under supersaturated conditions, with OOA2 exhibiting a higher activated fraction despite a lower oxygen / carbon ratio. A substantial increase in organic nitrate and organosulfur mass concentrations in activated droplets during fog events suggested aqueous conversions and formations of brown carbon with potential radiative impacts. Overall, our study highlights remarkably different cloud and fog processing behaviors between primary and secondary aerosols, which would benefit a better understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions under distinct atmospheric conditions."

We found that the trends did not match satellite data or emission estimates, revealing complexities in ammonia sources. While seasonal variations in ammonia were temperature-dependent, daily variations were correlated with water vapor. We also found an increasing contribution of ammonia reduction, emphasizing its importance in mitigating the effects of fine particulate matter in Beijing. 
 Ammonia (NH3) has major effects on the environment and climate. In situ measurements of NH3 concentrations taken between June 2009 and July 2020 at an urban site in Beijing were analyzed to study its long-term behavior, responses to meteorological conditions, and influences on the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs). The 11-year average NH3 mixing ratio was 26.9±19.3 ppb (median 23.5 ppb). The annual average NH3 mixing ratio increased from 2009 to 2017 by 50 % and then decreased by 49 % from 2017 to 2020. Notably, the long-term trend for NH3 at the ground level did not align with the trends derived from satellite observations and emission estimates. The NH3 concentration exhibited a stronger correlation with the daily variation in water vapor (H2O) concentration than with air temperature. Thermodynamic modeling revealed the nonlinear response of SIAs to NH3, with increased sensitivity when its concentration was reduced to 40 % of the initial level. Although reducing NH3 concentrations can improve air quality during winter, controlling acid gas concentrations has a greater effect than controlling NH3 concentrations on reducing SIA concentrations, until NH3 and acidic gas concentrations are reduced below 80 % of their current levels. Nevertheless, the increased mass proportion of ammonium salts in SIAs during the observation period indicates that future control measures for NH3 concentrations may need to be prioritized in Beijing."

The OA rise in the SEUS is driven by the enhanced formation of epoxydiol-derived secondary organic aerosol due to the increase in biogenic volatile organic compounds and sulfate, while in the PNW, it is caused by wildfires. A total of 10 climate models captured the OA increase in the PNW yet greatly underestimated it in the SEUS. 
 Drought events have been linked with the enhancements of organic aerosols (OAs), but the mechanisms have not been comprehensively understood. This study investigates the relationships between the monthly standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and surface OA in the contiguous United States (CONUS) during the summertime from 1998 to 2018. OA under severe drought conditions shows a significant increase in mass concentrations across most of the CONUS relative to non-drought periods, with the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Southeast United States (SEUS) experiencing the highest average enhancement of 1.79 µg m−3 (112 %) and 0.92 µg m−3 (33 %), respectively. In the SEUS, a linear regression approach between OA and sulfate was used to estimate the epoxydiol-derived secondary organic aerosol (IEPOX SOA), which is the primary driver of the OA enhancements under droughts due to the simultaneous increase in emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs; such as isoprene and monoterpene) and sulfate. The rise in sulfate is mainly caused by the reduced wet deposition because of the up to 62 % lower precipitation amount. In the PNW, OA enhancements are closely linked to intensified wildfire emissions, which raise OA mass concentrations to be 4–8 times higher relative to non-fire conditions. All 10 Earth system models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) can capture the slopes between SPEI and OA in the PNW, with CESM2-WACCM and GFDL-ESM4 performing the best and worst in predicting the OA enhancement under severe droughts. However, all models significantly underestimate the OA increase in the SEUS, with Nor-ESM2-LM and MIRCO6 showing relatively better performance. This study reveals the key drivers of the elevated OA levels under droughts in the CONUS and underscores the deficiencies of current climate models in their predictive capacity for assessing the impact of future droughts on air quality."

We demonstrate that the aerosol–cloud interaction's effect on top-of-atmosphere energy gain strongly depends on the underlying SST, while the shortwave part of the spectrum is significantly more sensitive to SST. Furthermore, increasing aerosols influences upper-troposphere stability and thus anvil cloud fraction. 
 Clouds play a vital role in regulating Earth's energy balance and are impacted by anthropogenic aerosol concentration (Na) and sea   surface temperature (SST) alterations. Traditionally, these factors, aerosols and SST, are investigated independently. This study employs   cloud-resolving, radiative–convective-equilibrium (RCE) simulations to explore aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) under varying SSTs. ACIs are   found to be SST-dependent even under RCE conditions. Notably, changes in cloud radiative effects for both longwave radiation and shortwave radiation lead  to a decrease in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy gain with increasing Na. The changes in TOA shortwave flux exhibit greater sensitivity to underlying SST conditions compared to longwave radiation. To comprehend these trends, we perform a linear decomposition, analyzing the responses of different cloud regimes and contributions from changes in the cloud's opacity and occurrence. This breakdown reveals that ice and shallow clouds predominantly contribute to the radiative effect, mostly due to changes in the cloud's opacity and due to the Twomey effect, which is proportional to the baseline cloud fraction. Moreover, with an increase in Na, we observe an increase in latent heat release at the upper troposphere associated with heightened production of snow and graupel. We show that this trend, consistently across all SSTs, affects the anvil cloud cover by affecting the static stability at the upper troposphere via a similar mechanism to the stability iris effect, resulting in an increase in outgoing longwave radiation. In conclusion, under the ongoing climate change, studying the sensitivity of clouds to aerosols and SST should be conducted concomitantly as mutual effects are expected."

The publication offers a new toolbox, illustrating NA's fragmentation and pattern of kinetic degradation leading to the formation of new small molecules. Furthermore, the research strategy presented here demonstrates how a mass spectrometer can function as a gas-phase reactor and the quantum chemistry method can serve as a reaction model builder. 
 Norpinonic acid has been known as an important α-pinene atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA) component. It is formed in the reaction of α-pinene, β-pinene or verbenone with atmospheric oxidizing reagents. In the presented study, tandem mass spectrometry techniques were used to determine the exact norpinonic acid fragmentation pathway in the gas phase. The precursor anion – deprotonated norpinonic acid (m/z 169), generated in an electrospray (ESI) source – was introduced into the collision cell of the mass spectrometer and fragmented using the energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation (ER-CID) technique. The experimental energy values of degradation processes were determined via analysis of the breakdown curves. Quantum chemical calculations of the reaction models were also constructed, including calculation of all transition states. Comparison between the experimental and the theoretical threshold energies calculated at a ωB97XD/6-311+G(2d,p) theoretical level has shown a good correlation. Two basic pathways of the fragmentation of the parent anion [M-H]− (m/z 169) were observed. Firstly this leads to the decarboxylation product (m/z 125) and secondly to the loss of a neutral molecule (C4H6O), together with the formation of the anion m/z 99. On the other hand, the breakdown of the anion m/z 125 gives rise to the m/z 69, 57 and 55 ions. To confirm structures formed during ER-CID experiments, the gas-phase proton transfer reactions were examined of all norpinonic acid anionic fragments with a series of neutral reagents, characterized by proton affinity (PA) values. Based on PA difference analysis, the most possible chemical structures were proposed for the observed fragment anions."

While impacts from large-scale meteorology were evaluated by separating ozone (O3) exceedance (>70 ppb) and non-exceedance (<70 ppb) days, we developed a technique that allows direct comparisons of small temporal variations between chemical and dynamics measurements under rapid dynamical transitions. 
 The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory (CSL) conducted the Southwest Urban NOx and VOCs Experiment (SUNVEx) to study emissions and the role of boundary layer (BL) dynamics and sea-breeze (SB) transitions in the evolution of coastal air quality. The study presented utilizes remote sensing and in situ observations in Pasadena, California. Separate analyses are conducted on the synoptic conditions during ozone (O3) exceedance (>70 ppb) and non-exceedance (<70 ppb) days, as well as the fine-structure variability of in situ chemistry measurements during BL growth and SB transitions.Diurnal analyses spanning August 2021 revealed a markedly different wind direction during evenings preceding O3 exceedance (northerly) versus non-exceedance (easterly) days. Increased O3 occurred simultaneously with warmer and drier conditions, a reduction in winds, and an increase in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). While the average BL height was lower and surface pressure was higher, the day-to-day variability of these quantities led to an overall weak statistical relationship. Investigations focused on the fine-structure variability of in situ chemistry measurements superimposed on background trends were conducted using a novel multivariate spectral coherence mapping (MSCM) technique that combined the spectral structure of two or more independent measurements through a wavelet analysis as reported by maximum-normalized scaleograms.  A case study was chosen to illustrate the MSCM technique, where the dominant peaks in scaleograms were identified and compared to BL height during the growth phase.  The temporal widths of peaks (τmax) derived from VOC and nitrogen oxide (NOx) scaleograms, as well as scaleograms combining VOCs, NOx, and variations in BL height, indicated a broadening with respect to time as the BL increased in depth. A separate section focused on comparisons between τmax and BL height during August 2021 revealed uncorrelated or weakly correlated scatter, except in the case of VOCs when really large τmax and relatively deep BL heights were ignored.  Instances of large τmax  and relatively deep BL heights occurred near sunrise and as onshore flow entered Pasadena, respectively.  Wind transitions likely influenced both the dynamical evolution of the BL and tracer advection and thus offer additional challenges when separating factors contributing to the fine structure.  Other insights gained from this work include observations of descending wind jets from the San Gabriel Mountains that were not resolved by the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model and the derivation of intrinsic properties of oscillations observed in NOx and O3 during the interaction between an SB and enhanced winds above the BL that flowed in opposition to the SB."

Our observations show that the enhanced light absorption of BrC relative to black carbon at the tropopause can be attributed to the formation of nitrogen-containing organic compounds through the aqueous-phase reactions of carbonyls with ammonium. 
 An enhanced formation of brown carbon (BrC) with a non-negligible warming effect at the tropopause has recently been found. However, its formation mechanism is unclear. Here, we report on a BrC formation process that happens during air mass upward transport by conducting simultaneous measurements on atmospheric BrC with a 4 h time resolution at the mountain foot (MF, 400 m a.s.l.) and mountainside (MS, 1120 m a.s.l.) of Mt. Hua, China, in the 2016 summer. Our results showed that the daytime light absorption (abs365 nm) of BrC on the MS is approximately 60 % lower than that at the MF due to a dilution effect caused by the planetary boundary layer expansion, but the daytime light absorption of BrC relative to black carbon on the MS is about 30 % higher than that at the MF, suggesting a significant formation of secondary BrC in the lifting process of air mass from the MF to the MS. Such a secondary formation accounted for > 50 % of BrC on the MS but only 27 % of BrC at the MF. Moreover, the N:C elemental ratio of the daytime BrC was 15 % higher on the MS than that at the MF, mainly due to an aerosol aqueous-phase formation of water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) compounds. Stable nitrogen isotope composition further indicated that such light-absorbing WSON compounds were produced from the aerosol aqueous-phase reaction of carbonyls with NH4+. Our work revealed, for the first time, that ammonia-induced aerosol aqueous reactions can significantly promote BrC formation during the air mass lifting process, which is probably responsible for an enhanced light absorption of BrC in the upper boundary layer."

Wuebbles,Understanding the role of contrails and contrail cirrus in climate change: a global perspective,"Radiative forcing of contrails could triple by 2050 due to increased air traffic and potential changes in flight altitudes. Factors like air traffic patterns, fuel efficiency, alternative fuels, and climate change further influence this impact. By highlighting gaps in knowledge and uncertainties, this research helps set priorities for future studies and assess strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of aviation emissions. 
 Globally, emissions from aviation affect Earth's climate via complex processes. Contrail cirrus and carbon dioxide emissions are the largest factors contributing to aviation's radiative forcing on climate. Contrail cirrus, like natural cirrus clouds, impacts Earth's climate. Even with the extensive ongoing research, the relative importance of the climate effects of contrails compared to other aviation effects on climate still has major uncertainties requiring further research. Contrail cirrus encompasses linear contrails and the associated cirrus clouds; these are characterized by ice particle properties, e.g., size, concentration, mixing, extinction, ice water content, optical depth, geometrical depth, and cloud coverage. The climate impact of contrails may intensify due to projected increases in air traffic. The radiative forcing from global contrail cirrus has the potential to triple and could reach as much as 160 mW m−2 by 2050. This projection is based on anticipated growth in air traffic and a potential shift to higher altitudes. The future climate impact of contrail cirrus is influenced by factors like the magnitude and geographical spread in air traffic, advancements in fuel efficiency, the effects of the use of alternative fuels, and the effects of the changing climate on the background atmosphere. This study reviews the microphysical processes affecting contrail formation and the aging of contrails and contrail cirrus. Furthermore, the study explores global observational datasets for contrails, current analyses, and future projections and will aid in evaluating the effectiveness and tradeoffs associated with various mitigation strategies. The research highlights gaps in knowledge and uncertainties while outlining research priorities for the future."

Results show distinct differences based on both air mass source region (North America, Ocean, Caribbean/North Africa) and altitude for a given air mass type. This work highlights the sensitivity of remote marine areas to long-range transport and the importance of considering the vertical dependence of trace gas and aerosol properties. 
 Remote marine regions comprise a high fraction of Earth's surface, but in situ vertically resolved measurements over these locations remain scarce. Here we use airborne data during 15 vertical spiral soundings (0.15–8.5 km) over Bermuda during the NASA Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions over the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) to investigate the impact of different source regions on the vertical structure of trace gases, aerosol particles, and meteorological variables over 1000 km offshore of the US East Coast. Results reveal significant differences in vertical profiles of variables between three different air mass source categories (North America, Ocean, Caribbean/North Africa) identified using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model: (i) the strongest pollution signature is from air masses from the North America category, while the weakest one is from the Ocean category; (ii) North America air has the highest levels of CO, CH4, submicron particle number concentration, aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) mass, and organic mass fraction along with smoke layers in the free troposphere (FT); (iii) Ocean air has the highest relative amount of nitrate, non-sea-salt sulfate, and oxalate, which are key acidic species participating in chloride depletion; (iv) air masses from the Caribbean/North Africa showed a pronounced coarse aerosol signature in the FT and reduced aerosol hygroscopicity, which is associated with dust transport; and (v) there is considerable vertical heterogeneity for almost all variables examined, including higher O3 and submicron particle concentrations with altitude, suggesting that the FT is a potential contributor of both constituents in the marine boundary layer.

Satellite records of tropospheric ozone currently show large-scale inconsistencies in long-term trends. Our detailed study of the potential factors (e.g. satellite errors, where the satellite can observe ozone) potentially driving these inconsistencies found that, in North America, Europe, and East Asia, the underlying trends are typically small with large uncertainties. 
 Ozone is a potent air pollutant in the lower troposphere and an important short-lived climate forcer (SLCF) in the upper troposphere. Studies investigating long-term trends in the tropospheric column ozone (TCO3) have shown large-scale spatio-temporal inconsistencies. Here, we investigate the long-term trends in lower-tropospheric column ozone (LTCO3, surface–450 hPa sub-column) by exploiting a synergy of satellite and ozonesonde data sets and an Earth system model (UK's Earth System Model, UKESM) over North America, Europe, and East Asia for the decade 2008–2017. Overall, we typically find small LTCO3 linear trends with large uncertainty ranges using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), while model simulations indicate a stable LTCO3 tendency. The satellite a priori data sets show negligible trends, indicating that any year-to-year changes in the spatio-temporal sampling of these satellite data sets over the period concerned have not artificially influenced their LTCO3 temporal evolution. The application of the satellite averaging kernels (AKs) to the UKESM simulated ozone profiles, accounting for the satellite vertical sensitivity and allowing for like-for-like comparisons, has a limited impact on the modelled LTCO3 tendency in most cases. While, in relative terms, this is more substantial (e.g. on the order of 100 %), the absolute magnitudes of the model trends show negligible change. However, as the model has a near-zero tendency, artificial trends were imposed on the model time series (i.e. LTCO3 values rearranged from smallest to largest) to test the influence of the AKs, but simulated LTCO3 trends remained small. Therefore, the LTCO3 tendencies between 2008 and 2017 in northern-hemispheric regions are likely to be small, with large uncertainties, and it is difficult to detect any small underlying linear trends due to interannual variability or other factors which require further investigation (e.g. the radiative transfer scheme (RTS) used and/or the inputs (e.g. meteorological fields) used in the RTS)."

These properties are key to understanding the effect of dust upon climate. We found two different playa lakes according to the groundwater regime, which implies differences in crusts' cohesion state and mineralogy, which can affect the dust emission potential and properties. We also compare them with Moroccan Sahara crusts and Icelandic top sediments. 
 Constraining dust models to understand and quantify the effect of dust upon climate and ecosystems requires comprehensive analyses of the physiochemical properties of dust-emitting sediments in arid regions. Building upon previous studies in the Moroccan Sahara and Iceland, we analyse a diverse set of crusts and aeolian ripples (n=55) from various potential dust-emitting basins within the Mojave Desert, California, USA. Our focus is on characterizing the particle size distribution (PSD), mineralogy, aggregation/cohesion state, and Fe mode of occurrence. Our results show differences in fully and minimally dispersed PSDs, with crusts exhibiting average median diameters of 92 and 37 µm, respectively, compared to aeolian ripples with 226 and 213 µm, respectively. Mineralogical analyses unveiled strong variations between crusts and ripples, with crusts being enriched in phyllosilicates (24 % vs. 7.8 %), carbonates (6.6 % vs. 1.1 %), Na salts (7.3 % vs. 1.1 %), and zeolites (1.2 % and 0.12 %) and ripples being enriched in feldspars (48 % vs. 37 %), quartz (32 % vs. 16 %), and gypsum (4.7 % vs. 3.1 %). The size fractions from crust sediments display a homogeneous mineralogy, whereas those of aeolian ripples display more heterogeneity, mostly due to different particle aggregation. Bulk Fe content analyses indicate higher concentrations in crusts (3.0 ± 1.3 wt %) compared to ripples (1.9 ± 1.1 wt %), with similar proportions in their Fe mode of occurrence: nano-sized Fe oxides and readily exchangeable Fe represent ∼1.6 %, hematite and goethite ∼15 %, magnetite/maghemite ∼2.0 %, and structural Fe in silicates ∼80 % of the total Fe. We identified segregation patterns in the PSD and mineralogy differences in Na salt content within the Mojave basins, which can be explained by sediment transportation dynamics and precipitates due to groundwater table fluctuations described in previous studies in the region. Mojave Desert crusts show similarities with previously sampled crusts in the Moroccan Sahara in terms of the PSD and readily exchangeable Fe yet exhibit substantial differences in mineralogical composition, which should significantly influence the characteristic of the emitted dust particles."

It was found that intercomparisons among aerosol mixing-state parameters derived from different techniques can help us gain more insight into aerosol physical properties which, in turn, will aid the investigation of emission characteristics and secondary aerosol formation pathways. 
 ​​​​​​​This study compares aerosol mixing-state parameters obtained via simultaneous measurements using DMA–CCNC, H(/V)TDMA, and DMA–SP2, shedding light on the impacts of primary aerosol emissions and secondary aerosol (SA) formation. The analysis reveals significant variations in mixing-state parameters among different techniques, with VTDMA and DMA–SP2 indicating that non-volatile particles mainly stem from black carbon (BC)-containing aerosols, while a substantial proportion of nearly hydrophobic aerosols originates from fossil fuel combustion and biomass-burning emissions. Synthesizing the results, some nearly hydrophobic BC-free particles were found to be cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)-inactive under the measured supersaturated conditions, likely from fossil fuel combustion emissions, while others were CCN-active, linked to biomass-burning emissions. Moreover, BC-containing aerosols emitted from fossil fuel combustion exhibit more external mixing with other aerosol components compared to those from biomass burning. Secondary nitrate and organic aerosol formation significantly affect aerosol mixing states, enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and volatility while reducing heterogeneity among techniques. The study also highlights distinct physical properties of two resolved secondary organic aerosol factors, hinting at their formation through different mechanisms. These findings underscore the importance of comparing aerosol mixing states from different techniques as a tool for understanding aerosol physical properties from different sources and their responses to SA formation, as well as aiding in the exploration of SA formation mechanisms."

Despite advances in science, not all the factors that lead to the formation of thunderclouds, to their charging and to lightning ignition are known in detail. This paper shows that lightning frequency may, to some extent, be modulated by solar activity and solar wind. Namely, in the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly of the Earth's magnetic field, it correlates with the polarity and intensity of the solar wind. 
 The cross-correlation between annual lightning frequency and solar activity and the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) is examined on a global scale using corrected data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) for the period 2009 to 2022. Relatively large regions with significant cross-correlation coefficients (p<0.05) between the yearly lightning rates and sunspot number (SSN) are found in eastern Africa, part of South America overlapping with the South Atlantic Anomaly, and the Indian Ocean and west coast of Australia. The main region that shows a significant correlation between lightning activity and the By component of the HMF and the magnetopause reconnection Kan–Lee electric field matches the South Atlantic Anomaly quite well. Also shown are areas that show a significant cross-correlation of lightning activity with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation index.Similar areas of significant cross-correlation are obtained if simulated thunder days are used instead of lightning counts. Possible mechanisms leading to the observed correlations and limitations of the current study are discussed. The findings of the present study do not support previous works indicating that cosmic ray intensity is in phase with the global occurrence of lightning, but they do not rule out the role of cosmic rays in lightning ignition in developed thunderclouds and the role of energetic particles precipitating from the magnetosphere in the significant correlation between lightning and the By component of the HMF (SSN) in the South Atlantic Anomaly."

Our study highlights the differences in aerosol–cloud interactions between land and ocean and between precipitation clouds and non-precipitation clouds, and it differentiates and quantifies their underlying mechanisms. 
 In this study we explore aerosol–cloud interactions in liquid-phase clouds over eastern China (EC) and its adjacent ocean (ECO) using the WRF-Chem–SBM model with four-dimensional assimilation. The results show that our simulations and analyses based on each vertical layer provide a more detailed representation of the aerosol–cloud relationship compared to the column-based analyses which have been widely conducted previously. For aerosol activation, cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) generally increases with aerosol number concentration (Naero) at low Naero and decreases with Naero at high Naero. The main difference between EC and ECO is that Nd increases faster in ECO than EC at low Naero due to abundant water vapor, whereas at high Naero, when aerosol activation in ECO is suppressed, Nd in EC shows significant fluctuation due to strong surface effects (longwave radiation cooling and terrain uplift) and intense updrafts. Cloud liquid water content (CLWC) increases with Nd, but the increase rate gradually slows down for precipitating clouds, while CLWC increases and then decreases in non-precipitating clouds. Higher Nd and CLWC can be found in EC than in ECO, and the transition-point Nd value at which CLWC in non-precipitating clouds changes from increasing to decreasing is also higher in EC. Aerosol activation is strongest at moderate Naero, but CLWC increases relatively fast at low Naero. ECO cloud processes are more limited by cooling and humidification, whereas strong and diverse surface and atmospheric processes in EC allow intense cloud processes to occur under significant warming or drying conditions."

A potential approach to compensate for this is the use of satellite measurements of ozone, because cyclones impact the tropopause and therefore also ozone. In this study we used this connection to investigate the correlation between ozone and the tropopause in the Arctic and to identify cyclones with satellite ozone observations. 
 Large-scale meteorological events (e.g. cyclones), referred to as synoptic events, strongly influence weather predictability but still cannot be fully characterised in the Arctic region because of the sparse coverage of measurements. Due to the fact that atmospheric dynamics in the lower stratosphere and troposphere influence the ozone field, one approach to analyse these events further is the use of space-borne measurements of ozone vertical distributions and total columns in addition to conventional parameters such as pressure or wind speed. In this study we investigate the link between cyclones and changes in stratospheric ozone by using a combination of unique measurements during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) ship expedition, ozone profile and total column observations by satellite instruments (OMPS-LP, TROPOMI), and ERA5 reanalysis data. The final goal of the study is to assess whether the satellite ozone data can be used to obtain information about cyclones and provide herewith an additional value in the assimilation by numerical weather prediction models. Three special cases during the MOSAiC expedition were selected and classified for the analysis. They are one “normal” cyclone, where a low surface pressure coincides with a minimum in tropopause height, and two “untypical” cyclones, where this is not observed. The influence of cyclone events on ozone in the upper-troposphere lower-stratosphere (UTLS) region was investigated, using the fact that both are correlated with tropopause height changes. The negative correlation between tropopause height from ERA5 and ozone columns was investigated in the Arctic region for the 3-month period from June to August 2020. This was done using total ozone columns and sub-columns from TROPOMI, OMPS-LP, and MOSAiC ozonesonde data. The greatest influence of tropopause height changes on ozone contour levels occurs at an altitude between 10 and 20 km. Moreover, the lowering of the 250 ppb ozonopause (at about 11 km altitude) below 9 km was used to detect cyclones using OMPS-LP ozone observations. The potential of this approach was demonstrated in two case studies where the boundaries of cyclones could be determined using ozone observations. The results of this study can help improve our understanding of the relationship between cyclones, tropopause height, and ozone in the Arctic and demonstrate the usability of satellite ozone data in addition to the conventional parameters for investigating cyclones in the Arctic."

The effects of these wind reversals on aerosol and cloud characteristics are not well understood. Using data from multiple datasets we found that southerly flow periods had enhanced signatures of anthropogenic emissions due to shipping and continental sources, and clouds had more but smaller droplets. 
 Wind reversals resulting in southerly flow along the California coast are not well understood in terms of how aerosol and cloud characteristics change. This gap is addressed using airborne field measurements enhanced with data from spaceborne remote sensing (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), surface stations (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments), and models (Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System and Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System), with a focus on submicron and supermicron aerosol, as well as cloud microphysical variables: cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud droplet effective radius (re). Southerly flow coincided with higher values of submicron aerosol concentration (Na) and mass concentrations of species representative of fine-aerosol pollution (NO3- and nss-SO42-) as well as shipping and continental emissions (V, oxalate, NH4+, Ni, OC, and EC). Supermicron Na did not change; however, heightened levels of acidic species in southerly flow coincided with reduced Cl− : Na+, suggestive of Cl− depletion in salt particles. Clouds responded correspondingly in southerly flow, with more acidic cloud water and higher levels of similar species as in the aerosol phase (e.g., NO3-, nss-SO42-, NH4+, V), along with elevated values of Nd and COT and reduced re during campaigns with similar cloud liquid water paths. Case study flights help to visualize offshore pollution gradients and highlight the sensitivity of the results to the presence of widespread smoke coverage including how associated plumes have enhanced supermicron Na.

A high-fidelity ambient instrumentation system was deployed at Madrid–Barajas Airport to measure the following: concentrations of organic aerosols (with their composition), black carbon (eBC), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), total hydrocarbon (THC), and total particle number. The average concentrations of eBC, NOx, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO, and THC at the airport for the entire campaign were 1.07 µg m−3, 22.7 µg m−3, 4.10 µg m−3, 9.35 µg m−3, 16.43 µg m−3, 0.23 mg m−3, and 2.30 mg m−3, respectively. The source apportionment analysis of the non-refractory organic aerosol (OA) using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) allowed us to discriminate between different sources of pollution, namely less oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA), alkane organic aerosol (AlkOA), and more oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA). The results showed that LO-OOA and MO-OOA account for more than 80 % of the total organic particle mass measured near the runway. Trace gases correlate better with the AlkOA factor than LO-OOA and MO-OOA, indicating that AlkOA is mainly related to primary combustion emissions. Bivariate polar plots were used for pollutant source identification. Significantly higher concentrations of the obtained factors were observed at low wind speeds (<3 m s−1) from the southwest, where two of the runways and all terminals are located. Higher SO2/NOx and CO/eBC ratios were observed when the winds originated from the northeast, where the two northern runways are located. These elevated ratios are attributed to the aircraft activity being the major pollutant source in the northeast area."

Lee,The effect of different climate and air quality policies in China on in situ ozone production in Beijing,"The impact of combined air quality and carbon neutrality policies on O3 formation in Beijing was investigated. Emissions inventory data were used to estimate future pollutant mixing ratios relative to ground-level observations. O3 production was found to be most sensitive to changes in alkenes, but large reductions in less reactive compounds led to larger reductions in future O3 production. This study highlights the importance of understanding the emissions of organic pollutants. 
 In recent years, clean air policies have led to reductions in air pollution across China. Alongside this, emerging carbon neutrality (CN) policies that aim to address the impacts of climate change may also deliver air quality (AQ) co-benefits or climate penalties. Different CN policies will lead to different changes in volatile organic compound (VOC), NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions, which will in turn impact the photochemical production of secondary pollutants such as ozone (O3). It is currently unclear how different combinations of AQ and CN policies may impact in situ O3 production across China in the future. A detailed chemical box model incorporating the Master Chemical Mechanism was developed to investigate the impact of combined AQ and CN policies on O3 formation in Beijing. The Multi-resolution Emission Inventory model for Climate and air pollution research (MEIC) and the Dynamic Projection model for Emissions in China (DPEC) were used to estimate future pollutant mixing ratios, relative to ambient observations of 35 VOCs, NOx, CO and aerosol surface area (ASA) during the APHH-Beijing 2017 summer campaign. The most ambitious policy scenario, “Ambitious Pollution 1.5D Goals”, led to the largest reduction in O3 production by 2060 but was not the most impactful scenario for reducing O3 production between 2030–2045. Larger reductions were observed under the “Ambitious Pollution Neutral Goals” policy, which focuses on achieving net zero by 2060. O3 production was found to be most sensitive to changes in the OLE2 group of VOCs (alkenes where kOH>7×104 ppm−1 min−1; a 5 % increase in OLE2 increased simulated O3 production by 1.12 %). However, reducing less reactive but higher concentration species in Beijing (such as short-chain alkanes) led to larger reductions in O3 production under all scenarios. O3 production was not sensitive to changes in ASA, with a 69 % decrease in ASA leading to a change of <1 % in O3. However, doubling biogenic VOCs in the model further increased O3 production in 2060 under all future scenarios by up to 18 %, indicating that the influence of future climate-induced changes in biogenic emissions may have a significant impact on in situ O3 formation in Beijing. This study highlights that the emission trajectories of certain specific VOCs are highly influential in determining possible future O3 air quality effects that may arise from increasing ambient temperatures and decarbonisation in Beijing."

Note that RFE increment is higher under clean conditions than that under polluted conditions, which is contributed to high-oxygen-content products. The enhanced RFE of amine–mineral particles caused by heterogenous oxidation is expected to alleviate warming effects. 
 The warming radiative forcing effect (RFE) derived from atmospheric amines attracts a lot of attention because of their contribution to brown carbon. Herein, the enhanced influence of amines (methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethylamine) on cooling RFE of mineral particles is first confirmed at visible wavelengths. Present results state heterogeneous uptake and oxidation reactions of atmospheric amines are feasible on mineral particles under clean and polluted conditions, which are proven by related thermodynamics and kinetics data obtained using combined classical molecular dynamics and density function theory methods. Based on mineral particles, simple forcing efficiency (SFE) results explain that amine uptake induces at least 11.8 %–29.5 % enhancement on cooling RFE of amine–mineral particles at visible wavelengths. After amine heterogeneous oxidation, oxidized amine–mineral particle cooling RFEs are furthermore enhanced due to increased oxygen contents. Moreover, oxidized amine–mineral particles under clean conditions show 27.1 %–47.1 % SFE increments at 400–600 nm, which is at least 11.3 % higher than that of itself under polluted conditions, due to high-oxygen-content product formation through amine autoxidation. Our results suggest cooling RFE derived from atmospheric amines can be equally important to their warming RFE on the atmosphere. It is necessary to update the heterogeneous oxidation mechanism and kinetics data of amines in atmospheric models in order to accurately evaluate the whole RFE caused by amines on the atmosphere."

On-board tests of VOCs from nine cargo ships in China were carried out. Results showed that switching from heavy-fuel oil to diesel increased emission factor VOCs by 48 % on average, enhancing O3 and the secondary organic aerosol formation potential. Thus, implementing a global ultra-low-sulfur oil policy needs to be optimized in the near future. 
 Mandatory use of low-sulfur fuel according to the global sulfur limit regulation has reduced the emissions of SO2 and particulate matter (PM) significantly on ships, and it also leads to a very large uncertainty in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Therefore, an on-board test of VOCs from nine typical cargo ships with low-sulfur fuels in China was carried out in this study. Results showed that the emission factor of VOCs (EFVOCs) varied largely from 0.09 to 3.01 g kg−1 of fuel, with domestic coastal cargo ships (CCSs) having the highest level, followed by inland cargo ships (ICSs) and ocean-going vessels (OGVs). The switch of fuels from heavy fuel oil (HFO) to diesel increased EFVOCs by 48 % on average, which enhanced both O3 and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation potential, especially for OGVs. Besides, the use of low-sulfur fuels for OGVs also led to a significant increase in naphthalene emission. These indicated that the implementation of a global ultra-low-sulfur oil policy in the near future needs to be optimized. Moreover, aromatics were the most important common contributors to O3 and SOA in ship exhausts, which need to be controlled as a matter of priority. It was also found that the benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene ratio of 0.5:0.3:0.2 on average could be considered a diagnostic characteristic to distinguish ship emissions from other emission sources."

Crowley,NO3 reactivity during a summer period in a temperate forest below and above the canopy,"In the scope of a field campaign in a suburban forest near Paris in the summer of 2022, we measured the reactivity of the nitrate radical NO3 towards biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs; e.g. monoterpenes) mainly below but also above the canopy. NO3 reactivity was the highest during nights with strong temperature inversions and decreased strongly with height. Reactions with BVOCs were the main removal process of NO3 throughout the diel cycle below the canopy. 
 We present direct measurements of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC)-induced nitrate radical (NO3) reactivity (kVOC) through the diel cycle in the suburban, temperate forest of Rambouillet near Paris (France). The data were obtained in a 6-week summer period in 2022 as part of the Atmospheric ChemistRy Of the Suburban foreSt (ACROSS) campaign. kVOC was measured in a small (700 m2) clearing mainly at a height of 5.5 m above ground level but also at 40 m (for 5 d and nights). At nighttime, mean values (and 25th–75th percentile ranges) of knightVOC(5.5m) = (0.24-0.06+0.32) s−1 and knightVOC(40m) = (0.016-0.007+0.018) s−1 indicate a significant vertical gradient and low NO3 reactivity above the canopy, whereas knightVOC(5.5 m) showed peak values of up to 2 s−1 close to the ground. The strong vertical gradient in NO3 reactivity could be confirmed by measurements between 0 and 24 m on one particular night characterized by a strong temperature inversion and is a result of the decoupling of air masses aloft from the ground- and canopy-level sources of BVOCs (and nitric oxide, NO). No strong vertical gradient was observed in the mean daytime NO3 reactivity, with kdayVOC(5.5m) = (0.12 ± 0.04) s−1 for the entire campaign and kdayVOC(40m) = (0.07 ± 0.02) s−1 during the 5 d period.Within the clearing, the fractional contribution of VOCs to the total NO3 loss rate coefficient (ktot, determined by photolysis, reaction with NO and VOCs) was 80 %–90 % during the night and ∼ 50 % during the day. In terms of chemical losses of α-pinene below canopy height in the clearing, we find that at nighttime hydroxyl radicals (OH) and ozone (O3) dominate, with NO3 contributing “only” 17 %, which decreases further to 8.5 % during the day. Based on measured OH, measured O3, and calculated NO3 concentrations, the chemical lifetime of BVOCs at noon is about 1 h and is likely to be longer than timescales of transport out of the canopy (typically of the order of minutes), thus significantly reducing the importance of daytime in-canopy processing. Clearly, in forested regions where sufficient nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide (NOx) is available, the role of NO3 and OH as initiators of BVOC oxidation is not strictly limited to nighttime and daytime, respectively, as often implied in e.g. atmospheric chemistry textbooks."

Numerical simulation experiments showed CRI could cause a 50 % reduction in aerosol radiation interaction (ARI) under a low-trough system. The results emphasized the nonnegligible role of CRI and its inhibition of ARI under wet and cloudy pollution synoptic patterns. 
 Persistent winter aerosol pollution frequently occurs in the Sichuan Basin (SCB) due to its unfavourable weather conditions, such as low wind, wetness, and cloudiness. Based on long-term observational data analyses from 2015–2021, it has been found that the four representative stations in  the SCB often simultaneously experience PM2.5 pollution accompanied by variations in meteorological conditions above 850 hPa, which indicates a connection between regional winter air pollution in the SCB and large-scale synoptic patterns. The dominant 850 hPa synoptic patterns of winter in the SCB were classified into six patterns using T-model principal component analysis: (1) strong high pressure in the north, (2) east high–west low (EHWL) pressure, (3) weak high pressure in the north, (4) a weak ridge of high pressure after the trough, (5) a low trough (LT), and (6) strong high pressure. Pattern 2 characterized by the EHWL pressure system, and Pattern 5, featured with LT, was identified as having key synoptic patterns for the beginning and accumulation of pollution processes. Pattern 1, characterized by a strong high pressure in the north, was the cleanest pattern associated with reduced PM2.5 concentrations. The EHWL and LT patterns were associated with a remarkably high cloud liquid content attributed to upper southerly winds introducing humid air. Clouds reduce solar radiation through reflection and scattering, resulting in more stable stratification and aerosol accumulation. This cloud radiation interaction (CRI) was more pronounced in the LT pattern due to denser isobaric lines and stronger southerly winds than in the EHWL pattern. Numerical simulation experiments utilizing WRF-Chem indicated that there is an upper-level heating during afternoon and surface cooling in the morning forced by the aerosol radiation interaction (ARI) under the EHWL and LT patterns. Additionally, strong surface cooling in the evening influenced by valley winds could be found. With wet and cloudy synoptic forcing, ARI directly affects the stability of the boundary layer and is modulated through CRI inhibition. For example, Chongqing exhibited lower PM2.5 concentrations and stronger ARI compared to the western and southern SCB due to lower cloud liquid content and weaker CRI inhibition on the ARI. The CRI inhibition caused a 50 % reduction in solar radiation and boundary layer height during the daytime under the LT pattern, which was larger than that under the EHWL pattern. This study comprehensively analysed the spatial disparities in cloud inhibition on the ARIs, their impacts on the boundary layer structure, and the discrepancies of these interactions under different synoptic patterns during pollution processes. The findings have important implications for the effective management of pollution processes in cloudy and foggy weather."
