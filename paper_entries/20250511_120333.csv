Detailed long-term sampling of pesticide concentrations, including rainfall and pesticide application events, is still lacking to better predict pesticide transport pathways and toxicity within agricultural catchments. In the present study, pesticide and TP transport dynamics were evaluated over a three-year monitoring period, which included 12 stormwater events and 7 dry events. An extensive target screening for 328 pesticides was conducted, while simultaneously performing suspect and nontarget analysis (SNTA) using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. Twenty-one pesticides and two TPs associated with the main crop, rice, were identified as the major pollutants. The risk assessment results, based on the stepwise toxicity data collection, suggested that insecticides, primarily neonicotinoids, exhibited severe ecological risk. Additionally, SNTA revealed the presence of 8 parent compounds and 46 TPs. TPs occurred following parent peak periods, indicating that integrated pesticide monitoring is a practical approach to risk assessment. A precautionary approach using SNTA of parent pesticides and TP identification suggests that the potential aquatic effects of pesticide TPs may be underestimated by a conventional pesticide monitoring strategy."

Application of the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS) has expanded dramatically for the molecular characterization of DOM in various research communities. However, data processing/mining on the detected tens of thousands of molecular formulas is complex. Here, we introduced a browser-based webtool (MoleTrans) for flexible and comprehensive postanalysis on a formula-assigned data set from FT-ICR MS. MoleTrans includes the classical but fundamental analysis/visualization techniques (e.g., chemodiversity, multivariate statistics, van Krevelen diagrams, formula composition plots, Kendrick Mass Defect (KMD) based homologous series analysis). Users can explore the putative molecular transformation relations in single or multiple samples using a Paired Mass Distance (PMD) network in a flexible manner (e.g., user-defined mass errors and reference transformation groups, etc.). This unique tool also supports the machine learning (ML) workflow (data processing and training models) for explaining the molecular transformation behaviors between samples (e.g., exploring the disappeared, resistant, and newly appeared formulas during the transformation). Therefore, MoleTrans provides the opportunity to unravel the molecular fingerprint in DOM mixtures in a comprehensive, flexible, and reproducible way."

While RCFs are generally considered environmentally friendly, they are not necessarily biodegradable, and their occurrence and toxicity in the environment have previously been overlooked. The lack of suitable extraction methods for RCFs may be a crucial factor hindering research on their environmental effects as it remains largely unknown whether the extraction methods for MPs are applicable for RCFs. This study revealed that digestion reagents (such as Fenton’s and H2O2) and flotation salt solutions (such as NaCl, ZnCl2, etc.) commonly used for MPs separation cannot effectively recover RCFs. The digestion of RCFs in 30% H2O2 at 70 °C resulted in significant breakdown and dissolution. Moreover, the flotation efficiency of RCFs in various salt solutions was <30%. We propose using soybean oil as a flotation reagent, which can recover 99% of acetate cellulose and 69–85% of other RCFs. This study is the first to highlight the limitations of the current methods for separating RCFs from environmental media and to propose a feasible solution."

Barsanti,Comprehensive Fuel and Emissions Measurements Highlight Uncertainties in Smoke Production Using Predictive Modeling Tools,"Predictive modeling tools, such as the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM), are used to generate estimates of the effects from wildland fires, including fuel consumption and smoke emissions. Given the use of such models in planning and forecasting for wildland fires, coupled with the adverse health and climate impacts of smoke, there is a need to understand the sensitivity to model inputs and processes, evaluate smoke production, and identify critical uncertainties. In this work, FOFEM was applied to a series of prescribed burns at the Blodgett Forest Research Station (BFRS), a western mixed coniferous forest in northern California, adapted to a frequent low-severity fire regime. We evaluated the sensitivity of predicted smoke emissions to parametric uncertainty in model inputs, including fuel characteristics (composition, loading, and moisture) and emission factors (EFs), and structural uncertainty in the consumption model. The results of the modeling simulations and comparison with a unique and comprehensive suite of fuel and emissions measurements suggest that in this application of FOFEM, fuel loadings based on land cover maps had the highest uncertainty and resulted in the largest sensitivity in predicted smoke emissions. The use of land-cover-based fuel loading values significantly underpredicted gas and particle emissions from the prescribed burns by up to ∼80% for carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and by up to ∼85% for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Improvement in the predicted smoke emissions could specifically be achieved by more accurate fuel loading data, particularly for duff and coarse wood, the consumption of which generated the majority of gas (∼50–70%) and particle (∼65%) emissions. For individual gaseous nonmethane organic compounds (NMOCs), predicted emissions were additionally sensitive to uncertainty in EFs, demonstrating that the accurate prediction of these NMOCs requires accurate representation of fuel consumption as well as representative EFs."

Besides conventional observations, target observations are essential to further improve initial field accuracy and then increasing high‐impact weather event forecasting skills. The identification of the sensitive area, where the additional observations should be deployed, is the key to implementing target observations. In this paper, a sensitive area identification system is established for the FuXi model on the basis of FuXi‐En4DVar, based on the fully nonlinear method of conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP). The CNOP represents the optimally growing initial perturbation and can be calculated by using the adjoint of numerical models in numerical forecast models, but in the AI‐based FuXi model, it is solved by directly using the automatic differential algorithm embedded in the FuXi model. Such an approach of calculating CNOP significantly increases the computational efficiency. Applying this system to the forecasts of 11 TCs demonstrates that the additional target observations can significantly improve TC track forecast skills, as compared with the other additional observations. Moreover, a small number of additional target observations can be expected to achieve the forecast skill comparable to, or even surpassing to, that obtained by tens of times more observations. This validation shows the potential of applying dynamical CNOP to AI‐based model for highly effectively identifying the sensitive area for target observations associated with TC forecasting."

Previous studies have shown that, while chemistry‐climate models reproduce the negative ozone trend in the tropical lower stratosphere as a response to increased upwelling, they fail to capture the ozone decline in northern midlatitudes. This study revisits recent lower stratospheric ozone trends over the period 1998–2018 using two types of simulations from the new Chemistry Climate Model Initiative 2022 (CCMI‐2022): REF‐D1, with observed sea surface temperatures, and REF‐D2, with simulated ocean. The observed negative trend in midlatitudes falls within the range of model trends, especially when considering simulations with observed boundary conditions. There is a large spread in the simulated midlatitudes ozone trends, with some simulations showing positive and others negative trends. A multiple linear regression analysis shows that the spread in the trends is not explained by the different linear response to external forcings (solar cycle, global warming, and ozone‐depleting substances) or to the main variability modes (El Niño‐Southern Oscillation and the quasi‐biennial oscillation) but is instead attributed to internal atmospheric variability. Moreover, the fact that some models show very different trends across members, while other models show similar trends in all members, suggests fundamental differences in the representation of the internal variability of ozone transport across models. Indeed, we report substantial intermodel differences in the ozone‐transport connection on interannual timescales and we find that ozone trends are closely coupled to transport trends."

Mixa;David C. Fritts;Thomas S. Lund,KHI Tube & Knot Dynamics in a Weakly Unstable Stratospheric Mixing Event,"Kelvin‐Helmholtz Instabilities (KHI) are known to be significant drivers of atmospheric turbulence. Recent observations show KHI forming with misaligned or angled billow segments that develop connecting vortex tubes and knots (T&K); these features promote distinctive, event‐defining instability and mixing characteristics that were not accounted for in prior idealized studies. Though T&K have been shown to increase mixing in KHI events with low Richardson numbers (Ri), their influence in weakly KH‐unstable, less‐idealized environments is unknown. Here we present modeling results of KHI in the stratosphere to assess the impact of T&K dynamics in weakly KH‐unstable environments. Radiosonde wind and temperature profiles from 22 February 2006 near Lamont, Oklahoma, measured vertically offset shear and stability peaks near 16.2 km with a minimum Ri = 0.11. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of this event reveal decreasing shear and increasing stratification, where Ri increases to 0.2 as the shear and stratification peaks move to a common altitude. The resulting KHI exhibit T&K features forming adjacent to, and in superposition with, secondary convective instabilities (CI) rather than superseding them as in prior T&K studies with Ri = 0.05. Newly discovered “crankshaft” instabilities distort the billows and give rise to secondary KHI with delayed, elevated dissipation. KHI that exhibit T&K dynamics are found to accumulate ∼60 ${\sim} 60$% greater mixing than axially uniform KHI with equal or lower mixing efficiency. The substantial increase in mixing suggests significant contributions of T&K dynamics to KHI events throughout the atmosphere that remain unaddressed in general circulation models' turbulence parameterizations."

Cumulus parameterization is a critical element in model‐generated CCKW activity among the various factors. This study investigated the impact of cumulus parameterization on CCKW simulation by analyzing the coupling mechanism between tropical convection and Kelvin waves, expanding on the stratiform instability theory. This theory suggests that CCKWs are enhanced through a positive feedback loop between stratiform heating and temperature. We aimed to minimize contamination from large‐scale environmental influences by employing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model configured for tropical channel simulations with spectral nudging. We assessed three distinct cumulus parameterization schemes: Grell‐Freitas (GF), Multi‐scale Kain‐Fritsch (MSKF), and New Tiedtke (NTDK). Our analysis revealed that the NTDK scheme simulates the strongest CCKW signal, whereas the GF and MSKF schemes exhibit weaker signals. The vertical‐mode decomposition of diabatic heating and temperature identified two prominent modes corresponding to deep convection and stratiform precipitation. The results demonstrated that NTDK shows the most favorable conditions for CCKW enhancement, characterized by substantial contributions from the second mode of heating and temperature anomalies. These aspects underline the critical role of cumulus parameterization for the enhancement of CCKWs, highlighting the importance of accurately representing stratiform instability to reduce deficiencies in CCKW modeling."

Central Europe, including Germany, lies in a transitional zone showing weaker and diverging change signals exposing the region to uncertainties. The recent extreme drought years in Germany, which resulted in multi‐sectoral impacts accounting to combined drought and heat damages of 35 billion Euros and large scale forest losses, underline the relevance of studying future changes in SM droughts. To analyze the projected SM drought changes and associated uncertainties in Germany, we utilize a large ensemble of 57 bias‐adjusted and spatially disaggregated regional climate model simulations to run the hydrologic model mHM at a high spatial resolution of approximately 1.2 km. We show that projections of future changes in soil moisture droughts over Germany depend on the emission scenario, the soil depth and the timing during the vegetation growing period. Most robust and widespread increases in soil moisture drought intensities are projected for upper soil layers in the late growing season (July–September) under the high emission scenario. There are greater uncertainties in the changes in soil moisture droughts in the early vegetation growing period (April–June). We find stronger imprints of changes in meteorological drivers controlling the spatial disparities of SM droughts than regional diversity in physio‐geographic landscape properties. Our study provides nuanced insights into SM drought changes for an important climatic transition zone and is therefore relevant for regions with similar transitions."

Aquifers with variability dominated by seasonal (marked annual cycle) or low‐frequency variations (interannual to decadal variations driven by large‐scale climate dynamics) may encounter different sensitivities to climate change. We investigated this hypothesis by generating groundwater level projections using deep learning models for annual, inertial (low‐frequency dominated) or mixed annual/low‐frequency aquifer types in northern France from 16 CMIP6 climate model inputs in an ensemble approach. Generated projections were then analyzed for trends and changes in variability. Generally, groundwater levels tended to decrease for all types and scenarios across 2030–2100 without any significant differences between emission scenarios. However, when comparing future projections to historical data, groundwater levels appeared slightly higher in the near future (2030–2050), with decreasing intensities in later periods. The variability of projections showed slightly increasing variability for annual types for all scenarios but decreasing variability for mixed and inertial types. As the severity of the scenario increased, more mixed and inertial‐type stations appeared to be affected by decreasing variability. Focusing on low‐frequency confirmed this observation: while a significant amount of stations showed increasing variability for the less severe SSP2‐4.5 scenario, low‐frequency variability eventually showed slight yet statistically significant decreasing trends as the severity of the scenario increased. For the most severe scenario, almost all stations were affected by decreasing low‐frequency variability."

 Experimental stroke models in rodents are essential for mechanistic studies and therapeutic development. However, these models have several limitations negatively impacting their translational relevance. Here we aimed to develop a minimally invasive thrombotic stroke model through magnetic particle delivery that does not require craniotomy, is amenable to reperfusion therapy, can be combined with in vivo imaging modalities, and can be performed in awake mice. We found that the model results in reproducible cortical infarcts within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory with cytologic and immune changes similar to that observed with more invasive distal MCA occlusion models. Importantly, the injury produced by the model was ameliorated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration. We also show that MCA occlusion in awake animals results in bigger ischemic lesions independent of day/night cycle. Magnetic particle delivery had no overt effects on physiologic parameters and systemic immune biomarkers. In conclusion, we developed a novel stroke model in mice that fulfills many requirements for modeling human stroke. Rodent stroke models are crucial but often invasive and limited in translational relevance.

 Soil quality is fundamental to nutrient-rich food production and the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems. However, inappropriate agricultural practices often lead to persistent soil exposure to air and sunlight, which increases soil organic matter losses and erosion risks, particularly under climate extremes. Here, we provide a satellite-based mapping of daily soil exposure occurrence across global croplands from 2001 to 2022 and evaluate the associated degradation risks caused by extreme climate events. We find that while 57% of global croplands experienced a reduction in soil exposure duration in the past two decades, 86% are increasingly subjected to climate extremes. The areas exposed to increasing climate extremes tend to have higher soil organic carbon levels, indicating an intensified degradation risk of global nutrient-rich cropland soils. Our study offers spatio-temporally explicit insights into global cropland soil exposure and its vulnerability to climate extremes, providing evidence to support improvements in sustainable agriculture practices.

 Protein synthesis in natural cells involves intricate interactions between chemical environments, protein-protein interactions, and protein machinery. Replicating such interactions in artificial and cell-free environments can control the precision of protein synthesis, elucidate complex cellular mechanisms, create synthetic cells, and discover new therapeutics. Yet, creating artificial synthesis environments, particularly for membrane proteins, is challenging due to the poorly defined chemical-protein-lipid interactions. Here, we introduce MEMPLEX (Membrane Protein Learning and Expression), which utilizes machine learning and a fluorescent reporter to rapidly design artificial synthesis environments of membrane proteins. MEMPLEX generates over 20,000 different artificial chemical-protein environments spanning 28 membrane proteins. It captures the interdependent impact of lipid types, chemical environments, chaperone proteins, and protein structures on membrane protein synthesis. As a result, MEMPLEX creates new artificial environments that successfully synthesize membrane proteins of broad interest but previously intractable. In addition, we identify a quantitative metric, based on the hydrophobicity of the membrane-contacting amino acids, that predicts membrane protein synthesis in artificial environments. Our work allows others to rapidly study and resolve the “dark” proteome using predictive generation of artificial chemical-protein environments. Furthermore, the results represent a new frontier in artificial intelligence-guided approaches to creating synthetic environments for protein synthesis.

Here, the authors show that anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh)-mediated signaling sustains molecular clock oscillations in the pituitary gland, thereby maintaining circadian homeostasis at both tissue and systemic levels. 
 Circadian clocks temporally orchestrate the behavioural and physiological rhythms. The core molecules establishing the circadian clock are clear; however, the critical signalling pathways that cause or favour the homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, we report that anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh)-mediated signalling plays an important role in sustaining circadian homeostasis in zebrafish. Notably, amh knockout dampens molecular clock oscillations and disrupts both behavioural and hormonal circadian rhythms, which are recapitulated in bmpr2a null mutants. Somatotropes and gonadotropes are identified as Amh-targeted pituitary cell populations. Single-cell transcriptome analysis further reveals a lineage-specific regulation of pituitary clock by Amh. Moreover, Amh-induced effect on clock gene expression can be abolished by blocking Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation and bmpr2a knockout. Mechanistically, Amh binds to its receptors, Bmpr2a/Bmpr1bb, which in turn activate Smad1/5/9 by phosphorylation and promote circadian gene expression. Our findings reveal a key hormone signalling pathway for circadian homeostasis in zebrafish with implications for rhythmic organ functions and circadian health.

 Smoke from wildfires across North American high latitudes can travel long distances, degrading regional air quality. Hourly fire emissions are a crucial input of air quality models. However, they are unavailable for fires at high latitudes. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-R Series satellites detects fires across North America every 10 min at a nominal resolution of 2 km, offering a good opportunity to estimate hourly fire emissions. At high latitudes, the polar-orbiting Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor provides 375 m fire observations up to six times a day for the same locations. In this study, we estimated hourly fire emissions at high latitudes for the first time by blending the high-temporal resolution ABI fire radiative power (FRP) and fine-spatial resolution VIIRS FRP. First, we corrected the parallax issue in ABI active fire data by considering land surface elevation. Next, FRPs from ABI and VIIRS fire pixels were separately aggregated into 3 km grids, and ABI FRP was calibrated against VIIRS FRP to correct for underestimation at large view angles. Then, the calibrated ABI FRP and VIIRS FRP were fused to reconstruct FRP diurnal cycles with the help of FRP diurnal climatologies. Finally, hourly emissions for eleven species were estimated using the reconstructed FRP diurnal cycles for two years (2021 and 2022). The results suggest that fires emitted a total of ∼0.54 Tg and 0.4 Tg PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 μm) in 2021 and 2022, respectively, with over 86 % of emissions released from summertime boreal forest fires. Moreover, hourly emissions revealed a general diurnal pattern: emissions were limited in the early morning, peaked around 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM local time, and decreased in the evening. Notably, the diurnal pattern of emissions varied by region and season in timing of peak emission and emission magnitude. Furthermore, we evaluated hourly emissions estimates using carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over 29 fresh smoke plumes. Evaluation results show that the hourly ABI-VIIRS CO estimates were significantly correlated with the TROPOMI-based CO estimates (R2 = 0.94, P < 0.001) and both were generally comparable, with a difference of 17.5 %. The proposed algorithm in this study has been integrated into the near real-time hourly Regional ABI and VIIRS fire Emissions (RAVE) product and is expected to improve air quality forecasting."

 Managing water resources in alpine, cold regions is increasingly complicated by climate change, which alters streamflow patterns and poses significant challenges to resource sustainability. This study addresses the critical issue of understanding how distinct hydrological watersheds respond to these climatic shifts. By examining four watersheds (BRW, the Burqin River Watershed; MRW, the Manas River Watershed; URW, the Urumqi River Watershed, and HRW, the Hotan River Watershed) with varying streamflow recharged characteristics, long-term streamflow was constructed by the SWAT model and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to evaluate the key climatic drivers of streamflow characteristics. Over the past 60 years, streamflow in typical watersheds has generally increased, with more frequent alternation between wet and dry periods. Notably, abrupt changes predominantly occurred in the 1990s, and these changes have shown a progressive delay as one moves geographically from north to south. Cold-season precipitation provides crucial solid water resources for alpine watersheds, with glacier melt driven by minimum and summer temperatures, while precipitation dominates other recharge systems. Future scenarios predict a significant increase in URW streamflow (approximately 18.3 %-25.8 %), while other watersheds are expected to see more moderate increases (around 4.6 %-12.9 %). Anticipated seasonal shifts include an earlier onset of streamflow advancing from April to March in the BRW, and delayed streamflow shifting to June in the HRW. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the BRW shows a decrease in late summer and early autumn streamflow, while the URW may become increasingly dependent on rainfall, indicating a potential temperature threshold for streamflow changes. The earlier onset of spring snowmelt, combined with increased streamflow and reduced summer precipitation, heightens the risk of spring floods and summer droughts. Building emergency storage and adopting dynamic seasonal water allocation can reduce the impacts of streamflow changes and boost climate resilience."

 Accurately estimating evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP), and winter wheat yield (WWY) is of great significance for climate change research, agricultural development, and water resources management in the cultivation regions of winter wheat. In this study, the coupling strategy of the Noah-MP land surface model and the multi-pass land data assimilation scheme (MLDAS) has been adopted to simulate the water-carbon fluxes and yield within the winter wheat-covered area in the Haihe River Basin (HRB). Utilizing the crop and irrigation modules embedded within the Noah-MP model, in conjunction with a double-variable assimilation approach encompassing leaf area index (LAI) and surface soil moisture (SSM), this study designed four schemes: Open Loop (OL), Open Loop with Irrigation (OL_IRR), Data Assimilation (DA), and Data Assimilation with Irrigation (DA_IRR). Validation results at both field and regional scales revealed that all schemes possess the capability to reasonably simulate spatiotemporal distributions for water-carbon fluxes (ET and GPP) and WWY to a certain extent. Through integrating multi-source observations, data assimilation schemes (DA and DA_IRR) outperformed open loop schemes (OL and OL_IRR). Notably, DA_IRR exhibited the most significant improvement, with reductions in root mean square deviation (RMSD) relative to the OL scheme as follows: 73.57 % for LAI (compared to a baseline RMSD of 0.88 m2/m2), 41.60 % for SSM (compared to 0.05 m3/m3), 54.99 % for root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) (compared to 0.08 m3/m3), 14.98 % for ET (OL: 1.22 mm/day), 35.42 % for GPP (OL: 4.24 g/m2/day), and 67.23 % for WWY (OL: 518.10 kt). Meanwhile, this study found that while irrigation slightly improves simulation results (e.g., a 21.19 % RMSE reduction for RZSM with OL_IRR), its effect is less significant than data assimilation. This highlights the potential for additional utilization of the integration approach involving the Noah-MP model and the MLDAS methodology to winter wheat cropland ecosystems, as demonstrated in this investigation."

 Accurate geospatial extent data of photovoltaic (PV) power plants is essential for assessing their socioeconomic benefits and environmental impacts.

To address these limitations, we proposed a novel edge-enhanced Segment Anything Model (ESAM) tailored for PV power plant extraction.

An edge module is developed to improve the edge delineation ability of ESAM. Additionally, a learning-based fusion module is designed to combine semantic and edge information to enhance PV power plant identifications. Validation demonstrates that ESAM achieved a high overall accuracy (OA = 98.46 %). Meanwhile, it outperformed three state-of-the-art models by providing higher accuracy metrics and more accurate edges of PV power plants.

 In recent years, research on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target detection based on deep learning methods has made substantial progress in model accuracy. However, there are still limitations related to model size and computational complexity, which makes it challenging to deploy the model on edge devices, limiting its practical application. To this end, this paper proposes an automatic pruning method for SAR target detection models based on multitask reinforcement learning called SARRLP. First, an automatic grouping strategy (GSP) for a deep learning SAR target-detection model network structure is designed. The network structure of the model is coupled with groups, and the same group has a unified pruning layout. The coupled groups are sorted according to the maximum entropy principle to achieve end-to-end pruning of the SAR target detection model. Second, an automatic pruning strategy search method based on multitask reinforcement learning (RLAS) is designed. This method automatically searches for the best pruning strategy for each network structure, and an entropy-based multitask reward function MOR is constructed to guide RLAS in searching for the optimal pruning strategy considering the edge accuracy, sparsity, and model feature channels entropy. Experimental results based on SSDD and HRSID show that the SARRLP method can achieve automatic optimal pruning detection models. With YOLOv5s as the baseline and a pruning rate of 75%, the accuracy of the SSDD and HRSID datasets is reduced by 0/0.4, and the inference speed increases by 184.4/106.2 images per second."

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from hyperspectral imaging is strongly associated with agricultural indices, particularly leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), in crop phenotyping. However, confounding factors such as spectral resolution (SR), canopy structure, and illumination reduce SIF sensitivity and complicate its association with these indices. This study focused on examining the effect of SR and mitigating the influence of canopy structure and illumination to enhance SIF accuracy. This study employed theoretical simulations, experimental validation, and two field experiments comparing devices with varying SRs to extract SIF at 687 nm and 761 nm (SIFRed and SIFNIR). Initially, SCOPE model was used to simulate radiance trends across different SRs. Secondly, narrow-band imager with 7 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM) were then compared with radiance from sub-nanometer and ASD spectrometers (0.3 nm and 3 nm FWHM). Finally, to modify SIF measurements, canopy structure was quantified using fluorescence escape fraction (fesc), while absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and intensity component from hue-saturation-intensity color model (IHSI) were used to account for illumination. And driver factor for SIF extraction was explored. Results showed a strong relationship (R2 ≥ 0.95) between original simulated radiance from sub-nanometer spectrometers and radiance resampled to 3, 5, and 7 nm FWHM. SIFNIR from the narrow-band imager correlated with the other spectrometers (R ≥ 0.64). While lower SR reduced SIF sensitivity, the narrow-band imager still showed potential for estimating LCC. Modified SIFNIR by fesc, APAR, and IHSI, improved correlations with LCC (R = 0.77, 0.74, and 0.86) compared to unmodified SIFNIR (R = 0.65). Estimation model based on SIF modified by fesc, APAR and IHSI presented RP2 of 0.73, 0.75, 0.84 and outperformed SIF (RP2 = 0.52), and photosynthetically active radiation and APAR showed R of 0.52 and 0.72 with SIFNIR, which indicated that disentangling confounding factors could enhance the sensitivity of SIF and structural effect governed SIF strongly than illumination effect. This study demonstrated the feasibility of narrow-band imagers for capturing spatial–temporal SIF variability by addressing confounding factors and can provide guidance for narrow-band instrument development for SIF extraction."

 Soil salinization is one of the main causes of low yield in cotton fields, leading to soil compaction and significantly affecting crop growth and nutrient absorption. There is an urgent need for rapid, non-destructive, and efficient methods to extract soil salinity spatial distribution information under cover conditions. These methods are essential for optimizing irrigation techniques, controlling salinization, and promoting sustainable agriculture. To address these issues, this study proposes a method combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral remote sensing data with a particle swarm optimization Gaussian process regression (PSO-GPR) model. Fractional-order differentiation (FOD) technology was used for spectral preprocessing, combined with the random frog algorithm (RF), uninformative variable elimination (UVE), and bootstrap soft shrinkage (BOSS) selection algorithms to optimize one-dimensional spectral bands. By integrating it with the optimal two-dimensional and three-dimensional indices, a PSO-GPR model will be developed to accurately predict soil salinity during the cotton emergence and squaring periods. The results indicate: (1) SG smoothing and FOD technology effectively enhanced the spectral characteristics of cotton field soils and crop canopies. (2) The soil salinity prediction model constructed using 0.7-order FOD combined with the BOSS algorithm yields the best performance, with an R2 of 0.92, RMSE of 0.15 dS m−1, and RPD of 3.54 on the test set.

 This paper describes a novel approach that uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery to identify river sections with persistent, stable, high-flow water. Such sections represent candidate sites for the generation of green electricity through the deployment of hydrokinetic turbines. Canada-wide mapping of potential hydrokinetic turbine sites requires Earth Observation satellite technology. The application of SAR satellites is advantageous because of their capacity to acquire high-quality images independent of weather and light conditions. Our SAR image approach includes two classifiers. The first identifies whitewater river sections in images acquired during summer. The second uses images acquired during winter to identify river ice and open water. Both classifiers are developed using a machine-learning algorithm that identifies classification thresholds in a multidimensional space made up of advanced SAR image parameters. The whitewater classifier makes use of backscatter and image texture parameters to achieve 92.6% accuracy. The ice–water classifier makes use of backscatter in two polarizations and a polarimetric decomposition to achieve 89.0% accuracy. In combination, the classes identified enable the mapping of river sections with persistent, stable, high-flow water, i.e., candidate hydrokinetic turbine sites.

 Droughts are hydrometeorological extreme events influenced by highly intricate land–atmosphere feedback mechanisms and climate variability. Deep learning models have recently succeeded in detecting extreme climate events and promise to uncover and understand droughts further. There are two main challenges of reliability and trustworthiness limiting their applications: miscalibration and inherent uncertainty. However, they remain rarely explored because deep learning models are overparameterized and seldom tractable. To address this shortcoming, we introduce methodologies for model calibration and entropy-based uncertainty quantification for deep learning-based drought detection. The calibration algorithm can deal with calibration errors by reducing distributional shifts and alleviating overconfident predictions. The uncertainty framework, in turn, decomposes and quantifies the total uncertainty according to several components: data uncertainty, procedural variability, parametric variability, and latent variability. Thus, our method identifies uncertain predictions and supports robust evaluations, benefiting the credibility of the decision-making process. Empirical evidence of performance in a wide range of European drought events is given, justifying the effectiveness of our approach. The calibration methodology yields the lowest expected calibration error (0.31%) and the precision of the uncertainty-based decision-making is improved from 72.27% to 74.06% and 76.59%, based on ensemble predictions and rejecting the predictions for the top 20% uncertain negative samples, respectively.

Carratala,Trends of anthropogenic sources in a Southeastern Mediterranean coastal site over five years,"•Notable decrease in traffic source contributions aligns with vehicle fleet renewal. •The decrease in the shipping source coincides with the IMO2020 sulphur regulations. •Bulk material mitigations cut exceedance days, but its contribution stay unchanged. 
 A five-year study of PM10 concentrations was carried out from 2017 to 2021 in the port of a Mediterranean coastal city, with an annual collection rate approaching 50 % of the days. The chemical composition of the PM10 dataset was analyzed to assess changes in both natural sources and the effects of regulations and mitigation measures on PM10 and its precursors. While overall PM10 concentrations remained stable over the study period, the analysis suggests that mitigation measures have contributed to a reduction in daily exceedances of PM10 levels in the area.Using positive matrix factorization, seven distinct PM10 sources were identified and ranked by their contribution: road traffic, bulk materials + dust resuspension, aged sea salt, Saharan intrusion, fresh sea salt, shipping emissions, and ammonium sulphate. Further analysis showed decreasing trends over the five-year period for road traffic, shipping, and ammonium sulphate sources, and increasing trends for Saharan intrusion and aged sea salt sources. No significant trends were observed for the bulk materials + dust resuspension and fresh sea salt sources. Although the measures taken by the Port of Alicante did not lead to a reduction in the PM10 average concentrations of this source, they did reduce the number of exceedance episodes. On the other hand, the efforts to reduce emissions from shipping and traffic succeeded in reducing the contribution of these sources."
