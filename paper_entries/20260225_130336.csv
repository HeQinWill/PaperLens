However, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the costs of bio-jet including but not limited to costs of feedstock, transformation costs and the competition with co-products of bio-jet that may be demanded elsewhere in the transportation or energy sectors. This study models alternative trajectories of bio-jet adoption in the US aviation industry by 2050 through the use of a global integrated multi sector dynamics model. Three bio-jet production and consumption pathways are presented- soybean oil to jet, corn ethanol to jet (ETJ) and Fisher–Tropsch-based bio-jet, with each pathway explicitly considering the co-production of renewable diesel and renewable gasoline alongside the bio-jet. Without explicit actions or technology changes to offset the technology cost of bio-jet, scenarios where bio-jet displaces refined liquids result in higher aviation fuel prices (ranging from a 25% increase to 120% increase by mid-century) and lower demand (ranging from −14% to −43%). Corn ethanol will play an important role in the US if large scale amounts of bio-jet are to be produced with smaller effects on demand and prices. While scenarios with high levels of bio-jet availability without the availability of ETJ in the US can significantly reduce emissions in the aviation sector, these reductions are achieved more through the reduction in overall aviation fuel demand rather than technology adoption."

We conducted a long-term modeling study for the Rhine and Elbe basins and their 146 subbasins from 1950 to 2021 to quantify the roles of diffuse and, in particular, point sources in driving stream NO₃–N concentrations. In both basins, simulated results show a decline in point source contributions from 1950 to 2000, followed by a relatively stable level at around 25% in the Rhine and fluctuations around 30% levels in the Elbe. The decline in the simulated stream NO₃–N concentrations in both basins after 1990 was largely driven by a decrease in point sources, and stream NO₃–N concentrations remained high (∼2 mg l−1) during 2010–2021, even when point sources were excluded. At the subbasin level, changes in point source contributions and stream NO₃–N concentrations reflected the overall trends of their respective basins, although individual subbasins exhibited diverse patterns. In subbasins with high stream NO₃–N concentrations during 2010–2021, point source contribution accounted for around 30% (median values across subbasins), and the fractions of agricultural, urban, and industrial land cover were relatively high. These results highlight that point source management alone is not sufficient to reduce stream nitrate to a good ecological status (< 2 mg l−1), and spatial targeted management is required to achieve good ecological status at both the regional and local levels."

This study modeled CCN and chemical composition, aerosol size and hygroscopicity (κ) of SOA using a model treating every single step. We evaluated the model ability and limitations in simulated chemical composition, κ, particle size distribution and CCN as a potential benchmark model and found that the accurate simulation of SOA size and κ is essential for reliable CCN prediction. 
 Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) contribute significantly to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which depend on particle size distribution (PSD), chemical composition and the hygroscopicity parameter (κ). Simulating SOA and CCN in chemical transport models relies on parameterizations, which need to be evaluated and improved against process-level models as a benchmark. Here, we simulated SOA concentration, chemical composition, PSD, κ, and CCN in α-pinene ozonolysis, a classical system for SOA studies, using a process-level box model PyCHAM with near-explicit chemical mechanisms. We assessed how CCN, chemical composition, PSD and κ can be modelled against measurements and evaluated the influence of these factors on CCN simulation. The model well simulated SOA mass concentration but overestimated O : C and H : C ratios, suggesting a possible lack of particle-phase chemistry. Highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) contributed substantially to SOA mass. Simulated κ closely agreed with measurements at moderate supersaturation (0.37 %) but was overestimated at low supersaturation (0.19 %) and underestimated at high supersaturation (0.55 % and 0.73 %). Particle growth and number concentrations were reasonably reproduced, though the simulated PSD was broader and flatter than measurement. Simulated CCN concentrations agreed well with measurements at moderate to high supersaturation (0.37 %–0.73 %) but were overestimated at low supersaturation (0.19 %). Sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of accurately representing both PSD and κ for reliable CCN prediction, especially at supersaturation < 0.4 %. This study also highlights that HOM formation, finer PSD resolution and improved κ parameterizations are warranted in future chemical transport models, and evaluates the ability and limitations of this benchmark model."

Buehler;Luisa Ickes,Advancements and continued challenges in observations and global modelling of atmospheric ice mass,"Our study shows that accurately representing atmospheric ice mass remains a major challenge. We compared climate models to satellite data, finding that conventional models consistently underestimate the amount of ice. While new, higher-resolution models perform better, both models and observations still have significant discrepancies. These shortcomings limit our confidence in cloud-related climate feedbacks, which are critical for our predictions of the future climate. 
 We assess the current status of atmospheric ice mass estimates by first critically comparing satellite-based datasets, then examining global circulation and global storm-resolving models. The analysis focuses on the frozen water path, which offers a more consistent measure across modelling and observational datasets than cloud ice or other partial quantities. As a reference, we use three retrievals derived from the CloudSat mission. Despite using the same input data, these retrievals exhibit a significant spread. Still, common biases cannot be ruled out, and we argue that the uncertainty in overall means can be as high as 30 %. A recently developed machine learning product based on passive thermal infrared observations greatly extends the spatial and temporal coverage available for comparisons, but its local precision is limited compared to radar-based retrievals.Global circulation models continue to underestimate frozen water paths compared to the observational benchmark and fail to provide consistent representations of regional temporal changes or the annual cycle. Storm-resolving models, which operate at finer grid spacing and explicitly resolve convective dynamics, show better representation of total ice mass, with variations among them similar to the observational uncertainty. However, several issues were noted, such as apparent deviations in the spatial structures of tropical deep convection, and they differ significantly in their relative amounts of cloud ice, snow, and graupel. Together, these findings reveal progress but highlight continuing uncertainties that limit confidence in projections of cloud-related climate feedbacks."

This study comprehensively utilized ground-based and satellite observation data to analyze the spatio-temporal variations of dust in the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas, as well as the diurnal variation characteristics of regional dust transport. This study has deepened the understanding of the variation patterns of dust around the Tibetan Plateau. 
 Dust transport around the Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a key role in regional climate and air quality, yet its seasonal and diurnal variability remains insufficiently understood. Here, we presented the spatiotemporal characteristics of dust transport in the TP region combining satellite observations, reanalysis datasets and ground-based measurements. A new method for dust mass concentration based on CATS (Cloud-Aerosol Transport System) lidar was developed and showed strong consistency with multiple products in both spatial and temporal scales. Our results revealed persistent dust transport belts on both the northern and southern sides of TP, with peaks in spring. The amounts of dust flux transported to TP were estimated for different directional sources, seasons and heights. The vertical variation and amount of dust backflow in Taklamakan Desert were analyzed. The diurnal characteristics of vertical resolved dust flux were presented in three-hour interval and four sections around TP. Overall, this study deepened the understanding of the dust climatology over the TP region from a satellite perspective."

BrC’s photobleaching has been determined as a key reason to the uncertainty in its global radiative effect, which has been poorly constrained. This study revelas the source-dependent BrC photobleaching rates, and explained this difference from molecular perspective. Consequently, the OH oxidation reactivity of molecular composition of different types of BrC determines their distinct photobleaching rates. 
 The global radiative effect of brown carbon (BrC) remains highly uncertain. BrC's photobleaching, which significantly affects its radiative effect, has been still poorly constrained. This study investigates and compares photobleaching rates of laboratory-synthesized secondary BrC (aq-BrC), biomass burning-derived BrC (b-BrC), and ambient PM2.5-derived BrC (p-BrC) to illustrate the variability in BrC photobleaching kinetics from different types of BrC reported in prior studies. Our results reveal a source dependence in BrC photobleaching rates. The highest photobleaching rate constant (kBrC) is observed for aq-BrC (1.13 ± 0.08 h−1), followed by p-BrC (0.12 ± 0.02 h−1) and b-BrC (0.05 ± 0.01 h−1), indicating the stable light-absorption capacity of b-BrC in the atmosphere. Integration of these rate constants with data derived from previous studies highlighted the differences in photobleaching behaviors among BrC from different sources. The OH oxidation of imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (2-IC) and methylglyoxal oligomers, nitrophenols (including phenols), and lignin derivatives governs the photobleaching of aq-BrC, p-BrC, and b-BrC, respectively. The high kBrC of aq-BrC is attributed to the high reactivity of the chain structures in 2-IC and methylglyoxal oligomers. In contrast, the highly conjugated structures of lignin derivatives in b-BrC impart stability against OH oxidation, resulting in a low kBrC. Our findings reveal the significant differences in the photobleaching behavior of BrC originated from different sources, underscoring the crucial need to account for source differences in assessments of BrC's global radiative forcing effect."

Figueiredo;Junxue Wu;Kai Wang,Gas-particle partitioning of pesticides in the atmosphere of the North China Plain,"Gas-particle partitioning is critical to govern the environmental fate of atmospheric pesticides, yet it remains poorly studied. Our work investigated atmospheric pesticides in gas and particulate phases in the North China Plain and their gas-particle partitioning mechanism. Results revealed pesticides in particulate phase were dominant. Absorption is the main mechanism of gas-particle partitioning, indicating atmospheric pesticides were absorbed into the interior organic film of particles. 
 Pesticide residues are ubiquitous in the atmosphere in the North China Plain (NCP), with concentrations largely determined by application patterns and physicochemical parameters such as persistence and volatility. However, knowledge of gas-particle partitioning of pesticides remains limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their abundance, transport, and health risks. Here, we aim to elucidate the underlying mechanism of gas-particle partitioning for pesticides. In this study, 14 pairs of air and particulate matter samples were collected simultaneously in Quzhou County, the NCP. A total of 19 pesticides were observed in both gas and particulate-phases. Average pesticide concentrations in particulate phase (2025.76±1048.83 pg m−3) were significantly higher than in gas phase (143.38±146.31 pg m−3), accounting for 93.4 % of the total atmospheric pesticide mass. Tebuconazole (662.49±448.52 pg m−3), pyraclostrobin (212.01±119.70 pg m−3), and carbendazim (158.68±86.54 pg m−3) exhibited the highest concentrations in the particulate phase, whereas pyrimethanil (93.00±79.18 pg m−3), pymetrozine (22.96±21.50 pg m−3), and imidacloprid (5.78±2.64 pg m−3) were predominant in the gas phase. A positive correlation between temperature and particulate-phase pesticide concentrations was found, as indicated by rising of logKp values which is likely attributable to an interplay of pesticide physicochemical properties, ambient relative humidity, particle phase state and pesticide use patterns. Gas-particle partitioning model simulations showed absorption as the main mechanism of gas-particle partitioning, indicating atmospheric pesticides are absorbed into the interior organic film of particulate matter."

Some unique characteristics of the vertical profiles of DSD parameters in the eastern Tibetan Plateau are found. The empirical relationships for quantitative precipitation estimates and attenuation correction in the eastern Tibetan Plateau with Ka-band radar are derived. 
 The eastern Tibetan Plateau has a high elevation, with a cold and dry atmospheric background. The features of the raindrop size distributions (DSD) in this region have notable differences from those in the plains. The general empirical relationships for retrieving parameters of precipitation from radar observations are not applicable in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we developed a new method based on optimal estimation theory to retrieve the vertical profiles of N0 and Dm from a Ka-band zenith-pointing Doppler radar. Validation by a field campaign during the summer of 2024 indicates that the mean bias in the log 10(N0) and Dm derived from the PARSIVEL2 disdrometer and the retrieved values are 0.12 and −0.1 mm respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the retrieved DSD parameters in this region. Based on the retrieved vertical profiles of DSD parameters, some unique characteristics are found. The heavy precipitation (the maximum value in the reflectivity profile exceeding 30 dBZ) exhibits a higher particle number concentration above 2 km and larger raindrop size in the bottom of the rainfall on average. The mean values of Dm above 2 km are approximately 0.5 mm, for heavy precipitation, the value increase as the raindrops fall, reaching a peak at around 0.5 km. Precipitation that occurs after the nighttime cooling usually has higher particle concentrations and smaller particle sizes. Based on the above research, empirical relationships for the quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) and attenuation correction using Ka-band radar in the eastern Tibetan Plateau are established."

We created GlobalGeoTree, a massive public dataset linking 6.3 million tree locations worldwide with satellite data. This dataset helps computers learn to identify tree species from space, supporting biodiversity monitoring and climate action. Our baseline model shows this is a promising path to understanding global forests. 
 Global tree species mapping using remote sensing data is vital for biodiversity monitoring, forest management, and ecological research. However, progress in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, labeled datasets. To address this, we introduce GlobalGeoTree, a comprehensive global dataset for tree species classification. GlobalGeoTree comprises 6.3 million geolocated tree occurrences, spanning 275 families, 2734 genera, and 21 001 species across the hierarchical taxonomic levels. Each sample is paired with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables, encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned into GlobalGeoTree-6M, a large subset for model pretraining, and curated evaluation subsets, primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval, a benchmark for zero-shot and few-shot classification. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model, GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M. Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing advanced models.

Here, we compiled an open global soil methane uptake database from the 1980s, covering most regions in multi-timescale along with the soil moisture and temperature data. The data show strong seasonal changes and different controls across biomes, helping improve climate estimates, models, and satellite evaluations. 
 Soil methane uptake (SMU), the second-largest and represents a biologically mediated sink for atmospheric methane (CH4) in terrestrial ecosystems, plays a non-negligible role in regulating the global CH4 budget. Field SMU observations have been conducted since the 1980s, but have not yet been systematically compiled within any unified and openly available framework. Here, we present the global Soil Methane Uptake Database (SMUD), which includes 2427 site-level records from 920 peer-reviewed publications spanning 1986 to 2025. SMUD contains SMU measurements at multiple temporal scales, including daily (n = 1425), monthly (n = 2001), seasonal (n = 1720), and annual (n = 1098), along with soil moisture and temperature data at daily and monthly scales. The collected datasets cover all major climatic zones and ecosystem types, across which SMU exhibits pronounced spatial and temporal variability. We found that seasonal- and biome-specific variations were key to understanding intra-annual changes in SMU. In particular, the effects of soil temperature and moisture on SMU are biome-specific: observations from Temperate Grassland are primarily associated with temperature changes, whereas those from Tropical Rainforest and Desert are mainly controlled by moisture, and other biomes show a mix of controlling factors. Overall, SMUD provides a comprehensive basis for understanding the global patterns of SMU, unraveling the underlying mechanisms, and estimating the global SMU budget. The database, associated data, and code to reproduce the results can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18299391 (Jiang et al., 2026).

It includes oil and gas facilities, coal mines, and other sources. We used machine-learning and satellite data to map the first global landfill dataset (~13,000 landfills >2.5-ha in size). METER should improve inventories of methane emissions by enhancing infrastructure counts and provides locations for tasking satellite detections. 
 Methane (CH4) is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas for warming after carbon dioxide (CO2). Methane is also more potent than CO2 ton for ton, with a global warming potential (GWP) > 80-times higher than CO2 over the first two decades after release and ~30-times greater over a century. Currently, approximately 160 countries and the European Union are attempting to reduce global methane emissions through the Global Methane Pledge. Accurate assessments of methane emissions are needed to track progress and verify emission reductions. Satellites are one of the tools being used to do this work, but satellites require accurate counts and locations of infrastructure types for tasking their imagers. Here, we introduce the first version of the MEthane Tracking Emissions Reference (METER) database. METER is a publicly available, global database of methane-emitting infrastructure, designed as a platform to be updated with new datasets identified by users. We combined public datasets and machine-learning (ML) identifications based on satellite imagery. We processed public databases of a given infrastructure type, using the collected databases as training and validation data to ML models on multiple sources of remotely sensed data to detect infrastructure globally. This synergy of ML with earth observation enabled a substantial increase in the completeness of multiple types of facilities represented in METER. It contains more than 12.3 million locations of methane-emitting infrastructure in more than 200 countries globally. The locations represent most major methane-emitting infrastructure types, from the fossil fuel industry (including oil and gas wells and wellpads, pipelines, refineries, terminals, and compressor stations) and from additional methane-emitting sources that include landfills, power plants, and coal mines. For some infrastructure types, most of the locations were made using ML. These determinations include to our knowledge the first global estimate of landfill locations (~13,000 landfills >2.5-ha in size), three-quarters of which came from ML approaches, storage tanks on oil and gas well pads (100 % ML determinations for both storage tanks and well pad determinations). We identified >170,000 new well pads globally, including ~40,000 well pads in Russia, one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, where to our knowledge no prior sources or public data existed previously. METER is already playing an important role in satellite tracking of methane emissions, providing satellite providers with infrastructure locations such as landfills to track. It should also prove useful for updating bottom-up inventories of methane emissions through more accurate infrastructure counts or “activity factors.”"

The current study explored the potential of deploying a coupled modelling framework for the estimation and forecasting of this parameter. The framework showed promising potential in addressing the challenge of estimating and forecasting the under-ice discharge. 
 Year-round river discharge estimation and forecasting is a critical component of sustainable water resource management. In cold-climate regions such as Canada, this task is complicated by dynamic river-ice conditions which alter channel hydraulics and render open-water rating curves invalid. Some methods such as backwater-adjusted rating curves and ice thickness-based rating curves have been developed. However, these methods are site specific and subjective to human judgement. It is therefore an active field of research and development. The current study develops and assesses the performance of a river ice forecasting system for the Chaudière River in Quebec based on coupled hydrologic-hydraulic modelling approach within the Delft Flood Early Warning System (Delft-FEWS) platform. The current configuration of the system integrates (i) meteorological products such as the Regional Ensemble Prediction System (REPS); (ii) a hydrological module implemented through the HydrOlOgical Prediction LAboratory (HOOPLA), a multi-model based hydrological modelling framework; and (iii) hydraulic module implemented through a 1D steady and unsteady HEC-RAS river ice models. The system produces ensemble forecasts for discharge and water level and provides flexibility to modify various dynamic parameters such as discharge timeseries, and ice properties.  Performance of the coupled modelling approach was assessed against “Perfect Forecast” for selected winter events between 2020 and 2023 using the root mean square error (RMSE) and percent bias (PBias) metrics. The hydrologic module of the system consistently underestimated the under-ice discharges.  This can be explained by the inherent uncertainty in the under-ice discharge estimates used as observations as well as uncertainty in the model states.  The hydraulic module had an RMSE between 0.1–0.5 m. The higher error in RMSE can be attributed to the uncertainty in the ice thickness estimates at one of the stations. The PBias analysis of the hydraulic module also confirmed that the forecasted discharges were under-estimated by the hydrologic module."

Secondary effluent-constructed wetlands (SECWs) offer a sustainable solution for advanced nitrogen removal from this low-ammonia effluent, yet the functional role of comammox bacteria remains largely unexplored in such habitats. This study investigated the abundance, activity, kinetics, and ecological adaptations of comammox in typical SECWs. Quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing revealed that comammox Nitrospira ubiquitously presented across all samples, even numerically dominated over ammonia-oxidizing bacteria/archaea (AOB/AOA). Consistent results from double-inhibition assays and DNA-stable isotope probing microcosm experiments indicated that comammox actively participated in nitrification, contributing 2.03–3.89 times those of canonical nitrifiers. Substrate kinetic and metagenomic analyses identified the Nitrospira nitrosa cluster as the sole active comammox population in SECWs, which exhibited relatively lower ammonia affinity (Km(app) = 0.055 ± 0.007 mg N/L) than other comammox species and distinct genomic adaptations to SECW-specific stressors, potentially explaining its dominance. Compared to AOB, comammox combines high substrate affinity with environmental resilience, aligning with K-strategist traits that enable it to outperform r-strategist AOB in SECWs. Overall, it is within this niche differentiation among comammox species and nitrifiers that the N. nitrosa cluster numerically and functionally dominated the nitrification process in SECWs, positioning comammox Nitrospira as pivotal biocatalysts for advanced nitrogen removal in engineered ecosystems."

We examined critical windows for the associations between heat exposure during pregnancy and fetal growth and investigated the role of air pollution, vegetation, and social stressors in these associations. Weekly exposure to ambient temperature and air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, O3) from highly resolved spatiotemporal models, vegetation, and contextual deprivation were estimated for 20,904 French women (2002–2017). Distributed lag nonlinear models evaluated associations between heat and term birth weight (tBW), tBW Z-score, and small-for-gestational-age. We further adjusted our models for air pollutants and stratified on vegetation and social determinants. Heat exposure during the first two trimesters was associated with reduced fetal growth. A mean temperature of 21.6 °C (95th percentile vs median 13.6 °C) during weeks 2–15 was associated with a reduced tBW (−199 g [95% CI: −268; −131]). These associations differed after adjusting for O3 exposure. Trends for stronger associations were observed in women with low vegetation exposure, low social position, and high contextual deprivation.

Yang;Ziyi Li,Enhancing Sorbate–Sorbent Interactions via Anchoring Multiple Nitrogen Sites into Multilayered Porous Carbons Enables Superior Toluene Capture,"Toluene, a toxic aromatic pollutant widely present in air, poses serious risks to environmental health, especially at trace concentrations. Although porous carbon stands out as one of the most potentially useful materials for toluene capture, achieving superior toluene capture from real-world ambient conditions remains a tough challenge, attributed to weak sorbate–sorbent interactions and competitive adsorption from ubiquitous water vapor. Herein, we propose a design concept centered on driving the tight binding between toluene and sorbent through multiple π–π complexation and point-to-point interactions by anchoring multiple nitrogen sites into multilayered porous carbon (FPC) via a urea-mediated pyrolysis approach. This strong sorbate–sorbent interaction mechanism imparts effectively enhanced adsorption and selectivity for toluene. This behavior enables FPC to achieve a remarkable toluene uptake of 344 mg·g–1 at trace concentration (400 ppm), surpassing previous benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains 97% efficiency even at 70% relative humidity, a performance unparalleled in known porous carbons. This work demonstrates a practical and scalable approach to designing high-performance carbon adsorbents through molecular-level functionality modulation, providing a feasible solution for the removal of aromatic pollutants under realistic conditions."

We measure Hg concentrations and isotopic compositions in 12 major Chinese rivers during 2021–2022 to constrain riverine Hg sources and evaluate trends and drivers of national riverine Hg export. We determine a two- to twentyfold decrease in THg levels in 2021–2022 (mean: 6.69 ± 4.74 ng L–1) compared with previous observations since 2008. The median δ202Hg, Δ199Hg, and Δ200Hg values of riverine THg are −1.22‰, 0.01‰, and 0.01‰, respectively. Hg isotope mixing model results reveal that soil erosion, wastewater discharge, and rainfall input contribute ∼51%, ∼33%, and ∼16%, respectively, to riverine Hg. The estimated riverine THg export in 2021–2022 was 45.1 ± 12.1 Mg yr–1, ∼46% lower than the 2016 estimate. We combine source identification and atmospheric Hg observations to demonstrate that water pollution controls contribute ∼95% to recent riverine THg export declines. Using new riverine Hg isotope data, we estimate that riverine export contributes ∼67% and ∼45% to estuarine and continental shelf sediment Hg, respectively, in East Asia.

Generally, the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels manifest as sharp oscillations or gradual variations depending on the mass transfer rate. Unlike sharp DO oscillations, the impact of gradual DO variations remains unclear. This study demonstrated that gradual DO variations (47.3%) enhanced 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) attenuation in iron-rich soils compared with sharp DO oscillations (31.2%). Hydroxyl radicals (•OH) derived from surface-bound Fe(II) oxygenation were the primary oxidants in both systems. However, the gradual DO variation promoted surface-bound Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycling, favoring steady hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation and its selective decomposition to •OH in kinetics, while the sharp DO oscillations showed declined H2O2 generation and increased termination reactions producing nonradical species (e.g., Fe(IV)). Thermodynamic calculations confirmed that Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycling sustained the surface-bound Fe(II) reduction capacity by suppressing amorphous Fe(III) oxide formation under gradual DO variations, thereby providing an efficient thermodynamic force to maintain favorable reaction kinetics for •OH generation. These findings broaden the scope of natural contaminant attenuation, extending its relevance beyond narrow, sharp redox oscillation zones to wider regions governed by gradual DO fluctuations in the subsurface soils."

We investigated these mechanisms using synthetic birnessite, a natural analogue of hexagonal layered Mn oxides, in controlled laboratory experiments in seawater under three scenarios reflecting different OAE deployment strategies: direct olivine-birnessite contact, exposure to simulated olivine leachate, and repeated alkaline inputs. Results revealed a dual role for birnessite. It accelerated olivine dissolution through proton-releasing cation exchange and surface-mediated Fe(II) oxidation. However, this proton generation consumed alkalinity, diminishing carbon sequestration efficiency. Regarding trace metals, birnessite efficiently scavenged Ni (>50%) and Co (>99%) but markedly enhanced Cr mobility (reaching ∼0.05 μmol kg–1), likely via oxidation to more toxic Cr(VI). Crucially, sustained Fe(II) supply mitigated this risk by reducing >50% of Cr(VI) back to Cr(III). Birnessite maintained structural stability throughout. While natural sediment systems are expected to introduce additional complexities, our findings underscore potential environmental trade-offs: Cr(VI) accumulation could exceed ecological thresholds in poorly flushed environments.

In this study, systematic screening of nitrogen-containing compounds showed that discrete inorganic nitrogen species (e.g., ammonium and nitrate) failed to induce any measurable degradation or defluorination of PFOA. In contrast, nitrogen-containing compounds with lone-pair electrons (e.g., glycine and nitrilotriacetic acid) acted as effective promoters, enabling a maximum PFOA removal efficiency of 88.4% within 300 min. Using glycine as a representative additive, mechanistic investigations demonstrated that cooperative coordination among glycine, PFOA, and the Pt electrode surface promotes anodic direct electron transfer. In parallel, glycine-assisted electrochemical processes generate reactive oxidizing species, particularly reactive nitrogen species (e.g., •NO3) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which contribute to indirect oxidation pathways. These two processes act synergistically to govern the PFOA degradation. Fluorine mass balance analysis further revealed that stepwise defluorination via CnF2n+1• and COF2 formation dominated mineralization, accounting for 85.4–97.9% of fluorine release, whereas short-chain intermediates constituted only a minor route.

Herein, we quantitatively elucidate the interaction forces between aged polystyrene MPs (PSMPs) and self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-functionalized surfaces at the solid/water interface using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (AFM), complemented by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis. The results reveal that adhesion forces are strongly influenced by aqueous salinity and pH, with π–π stacking and electrostatic/cation−π interactions likely contributing predominantly on phenyl- and amino-terminated surfaces, respectively. A robust correlation between nanoscale adhesion forces and macroscopic adsorption capabilities is established, enabling predictive understanding of aged MP–surface interactions. Guided by these mechanistic insights, a tannic acid-modified chitosan biomaterial integrating amino and phenyl functionalities is developed, achieving over 92.1% removal efficiency for aged PSMPs across diverse water chemistries at an environmentally relevant initial MP concentration of 1 mg L–1. This work provides an intermolecular force–driven design paradigm that bridges nanoscale intermolecular interaction mechanisms with macroscopic material performance, offering theoretical and practical guidance for next-generation remediation strategies targeting environmentally aged MPs."

Soil biodegradability is typically established in laboratory soil incubations at constant temperatures exceeding those in many field soils, highlighting the need for robust temperature-biodegradability relationships to transfer laboratory-determined biodegradation rates to field conditions. This work systematically assesses the temperature dependence of the biodegradation of three poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) variants, containing differing molar amounts of 3-hydroxyhexanoate (where x = 5, 9, and 12%) in three agricultural soils. Scanning electron microscopy images of PHBHH9 films incubated for 18 days showed increasing film surface colonization by fungi and/or filamentous bacteria from 5 to 15, 25, and 35 °C, with dense hyphal networks and film disintegration at the higher tested temperatures. Soil biodegradation of PHBHHx powders over the same temperature range was followed by extracting and quantifying residual PHBHHx mass over time by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Fitting of these residual masses with a shoulder-log linear kinetic model yielded PHBHHx-variant-independent initial lag phases and biodegradation rate constants. Increasing the temperature shortened the initial lag phase and increased the subsequent rate of PHBHHx biodegradation. Arrhenius rate law analysis revealed soil-specific activation energies that correspond to approximately 2- to 5-fold changes in biodegradation rates per 10 °C. This work establishes temperature as a key abiotic factor controlling polyester biodegradation rates in soils and guides more accurate extrapolation of laboratory-determined biodegradation rates at elevated temperatures to field conditions."

To resolve this, we reveal the physical–structural relationships of river macrolitter using two of the most comprehensive data sets generated to date. First, we dissect the properties of river litter using a detailed data set of 14,052 riverbank items, for which their dimensions (longest L1, intermediate L2, shortest L3) and physical characteristics (mass, volume, density) are determined. These properties are mapped onto a data set of 239,290 River-OSPAR items collected from 22 river and riverbank sites across four continents, using multivariate statistics and database density estimates. We then identify the most persistent River-OSPAR litter categories, together with kernel density estimations of their principal dimensions and geometries. Results show that only 25 River-OSPAR categories account for 80% of all river and riverbank litter, with soft plastic pieces/films and candy, snack, and crisp packaging being the most abundant. Flat, 2D-shaped macrolitter are the most persistent litter items, with 48% of the top 25 items sharing similar geometric properties: L1 between 1–10 cm, and a flatness ratio (L3/L2) of <0.4. In practice, these are flat objects with two larger dimensions and a third that is at least 1 order of magnitude smaller. This large, physically based data set enables the prioritization of which shapes, sizes, and densities should be targeted by future plastic transport models, informing what plastics may be missing in current monitoring protocols and the design of river cleanup technologies."

Here, we investigated the association between BDE 47 and MASLD using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and explored the potential mechanisms through network toxicology and multiomics analyses. Individuals with higher serum BDE 47 levels showed positive associations with MASLD and advanced fibrosis. Network toxicology predicted that BDE 47 perturbed lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress, thereby contributing to malignant progression. In vitro, integrated lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that BDE 47 disrupted lysosome, sphingolipid, and cholesterol metabolism, leading to lipid accumulation. Additionally, BDE 47 exposure enhanced inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and the development of immunosuppressive environment, which may facilitate MASLD-to-HCC progression. Pharmacological experiments further demonstrated that increased sphingolipid synthesis and impaired cholesterol efflux played important roles in BDE 47-induced lipid accumulation. Notably, only the parent BDE 47 compound was detected in exposed cells.

A key SOA formation pathway is the reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX), a process influenced by multiple environmental factors. Here, we simulate the spatial distribution and interannual trend of IEPOX-SOA over Eastern China from 2014 to 2019 using CMAQ and quantify the contributions of different factors. Our results indicate that ambient IEPOX-SOA concentrations are elevated in central and northeast China, averaging 135 ng·m−3 and with a recent declining trend between −19.1 and −34.8 ng·m−3·yr−1. Long-term trends of IEPOX-SOA are primarily driven by changes in sulfate (−50.5 ng·m−3·yr−1), which serve as seed aerosols, while a decrease in organic carbon reduces the coating effects and partially offsets (+16.1 ng·m−3·yr−1) the decline. Aerosol acidity plays a key role in governing its spatial distribution by affecting reactive rates. In Eastern China, high ammonia levels effectively neutralize acidity, thereby suppressing abundant IEPOX-SOA formation, resulting in lower concentrations compared to other regions, such as the United States. Sensitivity tests indicate that substantial future NH3 reductions in China could increase the IEPOX-SOA by up to 100%.

Pyrite was substituted with trace levels of Ni and Co to systematically investigate the influence of their incorporation on interfacial reactions and the generation of redox active species under light irradiation. Photocatalytic degradation of model organic matter and a pollutant in the presence of pyrite was significantly accelerated by the trace Ni/Co substitution. Trace Ni/Co substitution was found to significantly enhance the photochemical reactivity of pyrite through altering the pathways of interfacial redox reactions, accelerating the release of Fe2+, sustaining the production of redox active species, and suppressing the oxidation of sulfur. Specifically, Ni substitution increased •OH production by 1.80-fold, mainly via a photoelectron-driven reduction that sustains the photo-Fenton process. Co substitution increased •OH production by 1.64-fold, primarily through photo-Fenton and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes. Dual substitution with Ni and Co leads to cooperative enhancement of •OH production by 1.97-fold through multiple pathways, including photo-Fenton, LMCT, and reactions involving Fe2+/sulfur intermediates and O2.

However, the vertical variations of NO3 chemistry within the nocturnal boundary layer remain poorly understood, owing to the stratification of air masses and complex vertical chemistry. Here, we combined vertical and ground-based measurements of NO3 precursors from diverse atmospheric environments with model simulations to investigate the vertical structure of nocturnal NO3 oxidation and its long-term trend. Our results indicate that the nocturnal enhanced NO3 chemistry aloft event occurs far more frequently in megacities (64–72%) than in representative clean areas (16%), with a median enhancement factor of 2.7 relative to the surface. The event largely promotes the formation of secondary pollutants aloft rather than at the surface. We further show the event is more prevalent in China and India, attributed to intense ground-level NOx emissions, than in the United States and Europe. However, its frequency has declined rapidly in China in recent years, closely linked to the implementation of NOx emission controls. These findings highlight the critical role of vertical gradients in nocturnal NO3 chemistry on surface air pollution and underscore the need for comprehensive vertical measurements to support further improvement of urban air quality."

Substantial field surveys have been undertaken to explore the dynamics of MPs in urban runoff within small catchments (typically below 1000 km2). Nevertheless, identifying potential sources of MPs in large regions remains a challenging task. In this study, we provide a polymer-type-specific exploration of MPs in a large metropolitan area located on a piedmont alluvial fan, spanning over 16 000 km2. A total of 20 759 MPs (size ranging from 20 to 500 μm), representing 11 polymer types, were identified using laser direct infrared (LDIR) chemical imaging spectroscopy. Different sampling types, including impervious surfaces, roof drainage, and soil slopes across both hilly and plain areas, were included in this study. Multivariate statistical analyses, including partial least squares path modeling, showed that the abundance of MPs was influenced by precipitation characteristics, topography, and degree of rurality. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence from abundance, polymer type, oxidation, and fouling characteristics suggested contributions from both local mobilization of soil MPs and atmospheric deposition.

Prather,Wind-Driven Influence on Submicron Sea Spray Aerosol Chemical Mixing State,"Sea spray aerosols (SSA) influence cloud properties by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice-nucleating particles (INP), yet the factors controlling their climate-relevant properties remain poorly constrained. Current models often oversimplify SSA composition while neglecting the potential impact of wind speed variability. Here, we present the first direct measurements of SSA chemical mixing state under controlled wind speeds (11–18 m/s) in the Scripps Ocean-Atmosphere Research Simulator (SOARS). These experiments isolate the impact of wind speed on SSA chemical mixing state while limiting biological variability. Increasing wind speed drives a transition toward more homogeneous, salt-enriched SSA, increasing from 46% at 11 m/s to 80% at 18 m/s. Simultaneously, aerosolized coastal water pollutants decline sharply, while organic-enriched and biologically influenced particles increase, consistent with wind-driven disruption of the sea surface microlayer. As the size of SSA particles approaches the CCN-relevant range, we observe enhanced organic fractions, largely associated with sea salt. Moreover, the rise in larger accumulation mode SSA (>700 nm) enriched with biological species at high wind speeds is consistent with observed increases in INP concentrations in parallel SOARS measurements. This study demonstrates how wind-driven changes alter SSA mixing state, underscoring the need to incorporate these effects when modeling SSA climate properties and aerosol–cloud interactions."

Fung,Advancing EKMA Applications in Regional Air Quality Models: Insights into Interpretive Biases and Ozone Abatement Policies,"The Empirical Kinetics Modeling Approach (EKMA) is a valuable tool for guiding ozone (O3) precursor emission controls, but O3 isopleths generated through regional emission perturbations in regional air quality models (RAQMs) may hide interpretive biases for local applications. Using the WRF-CMAQ model, this study constructs city-specific EKMA diagrams by perturbing O3 precursor emissions across the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China and integrates source apportionment to quantify these biases. Results reveal that such isopleths overestimate city-specific control efficacy by approximately 58.7% on average across the GBA cities, based on monthly O3 metrics, with biases persisting as high as 47.2% even in relatively stagnant meteorological conditions. This indicates that local isopleths derived from regional emission perturbations inadequately represent the effectiveness of local emission controls. Reinterpreting the city-specific isopleths from a regional emission reduction perspective and applying multiple air quality indicators, we observe O3 concentration rebounds in numerous GBA cities due to inappropriate NOx reductions. Nonetheless, when shifting to a risk-based perspective, short-term NOx reductions achieve overall health benefits by offsetting greater NO2 risks, which outweigh the elevated O3-related risks in VOC-limited regimes. These insights provide evidence supporting governmental efforts to prioritize short-term, cost-effective NOx-focused controls, which deliver immediate health benefits, particularly in high-NOx urban cores. Additionally, this study offers positive incentives for adopting long-term attainment strategies with balanced NOx:AVOCs (anthropogenic VOCs) ratios of 1:1 or even 2:1 to achieve air pollution abatement and decarbonization in the GBA simultaneously. Our work highlights the imperative of aligning EKMA-RAQMs diagram interpretations with experimental designs and provides a novel perspective for holistically evaluating regional emission control policies."

A systematic evaluation of the NCD burden attributable to e-cigarettes is critically needed to inform policy. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the burden of major NCDs attributable to e-cigarette use between 2010 and 2021 and project future trends through 2050. This study used deidentified 2010–2021 NCD data from GBD 2021. We applied a comparative risk assessment framework to estimate the burden of NCDs attributable to e-cigarette use and used a generalized additive model to project future trends. We found that between 2010 and 2021, global prevalence of current e-cigarette use increased from 0.90% (95% CI, 0.46–1.48) to 8.73% (95% CI, 5.24–12.99). During this period, prevalent cases and DALYs for major NCDs showed consistent upward trends worldwide. Notably, NCD DALYs attributable to e-cigarette use increased from 2010 to 2021. Projections indicate that this concerning trend will continue, with marked increases in e-cigarette-attributable NCD burden anticipated through 2050.

Dysregulated lipid metabolism in activated microglia contributes to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PM0.1-induced lipid metabolic disruption remain poorly understood. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging regulators of lipid metabolism, prompting us to investigate their role in PM0.1-exposed microglia. In vitro models of PM0.1-treated microglia (HMC3 and BV2) were established. We identified circDNAJC5, a lipid metabolism–associated circRNA, as significantly downregulated during PM0.1-induced lipid metabolic disruption. circDNAJC5 silencing aggravated lipid dysregulation, whereas its overexpression mitigated PM0.1-induced metabolic alterations. circDNAJC5 functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-98–5p, thereby regulating sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1), a key enzyme in the sphingolipid signaling pathway. circDNAJC5 downregulation and lipid metabolic abnormalities were further validated in the brains of PM-exposed mice and AD mouse models, as well as in the blood of elderly individuals with cognitive impairment and hyperlipidemia. These findings highlight an epigenetic mechanism linking environmental exposure to microglial lipid metabolism and suggest circDNAJC5 as a potential biomarker for neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders."

The latter is ∼4X the precipitation change observed since 1950. Glacier morphology and topographic setting explain 32% of ΔELA variance, likely reflecting differing sensitivities to climatic shifts and elevation‐dependent warming. Spatially interpolated ΔELA residuals are most strongly correlated to winter precipitation (r = −0.67).

Using observations in Shanghai, we show that ambient aerosols exhibit a bimodal size distribution, with the larger mode strongly correlated with NV‐PM (R2 ∼ 0.83), suggesting that NV‐PM acts as seed particles. We propose an S/L‐mode mixing‐state classification that separates small and large diameter modes and apply a core–shell optical model using retrieved refractive indices for NV‐PM and coatings. Modeled absorption at 530 nm agrees with observations and reproduces the mean absorption enhancement (Eabs ∼ 2.80 vs. 3.28 observed).

We estimate geomagnetic reversal frequency from 0 to 155 Ma using adaptive‐bandwidth kernel density estimation (AKDE) to evaluate data sparseness and to assess how reversal frequency changes when recently identified geomagnetic reversals are incorporated into the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) data set. AKDE is a two‐stage procedure that uses an initial density estimator based on an initial (pilot) bandwidth. We found that the pilot bandwidth determined using cross‐validation is stable with respect to data set length. The AKDE results obtained based on the cross‐validated pilot bandwidth reveal four troughs after the Cretaceous Normal Superchron, spaced 13.5–15.0 Myr apart and corresponding to relatively long chrons (>0.8 Myr). One trough near 32 Ma becomes less distinct after the four recently identified reversals are added to the data set.

In the mid‐latitude Northeast Pacific (NEP), persistent sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) have attracted wide attention in recent decades and have been linked to tropical variability. Considering their important climate impacts and potential linkages, this study investigates the non‐stationary relationship between SSTAs in the NEP (SSTANEP) and ENSO using correlation decomposition and Linear Inverse Modeling. Our analysis reveals notable shifts in the SSTANEP‐ENSO linkage during 1961–2022. Before 1980, SSTANEP exhibited minimal influence on ENSO evolution. Conversely, during 1981–2000, SSTANEP substantially contributed to ENSO development, primarily via the North Pacific Meridional Mode. However, after 2000, this relationship has weakened again, suggesting a complex interplay between SSTANEP and ENSO. Understanding these relationship shifts is essential for advancing ENSO predictability and thereby enhancing the reliability of seasonal‐to‐decadal climate prediction."

Two Polar Radiant Energy in the Far Infrared Experiment (PREFIRE) satellites, PREFIRE2 (SAT‐2) and PREFIRE1 (SAT‐1), were launched in 2024. They measure spectrally resolved radiances from 5 to 53 μm at 0.84 μm spectral resolution. Deriving spectral outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and tracking its changes relative to other polar climate factors are key focuses of the PREFIRE mission. We describe a set of algorithms developed to estimate spectral OLR from the PREFIRE L1B‐calibrated radiances. Spectral angular distribution models were developed to invert spectral radiance to spectral flux. For the spectral region not covered by the PREFIRE measurements, a principal‐component‐based linear regression scheme is used to estimate the spectral flux. When the clear‐sky spectral OLRs derived from the PREFIRE SAT‐2 measurements are compared with counterparts derived from in situ measurements, the mean differences in broadband and far‐IR OLR are 7.5 and 3.4 Wm−2, respectively. The results are also evaluated against collocated broadband and other spectral satellite measurements. The difference (mean ± standard deviation) between the collocated PREFIRE SAT‐2 and CERES broadband OLR is 2.8 ± 5.7 and 2.7 ± 6.5 Wm−2 for clear‐sky and cloudy‐sky footprints, respectively. Similar agreements can be seen from the comparisons with spectral OLR derived from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder and Cross‐track Infrared Sounder measurements. In general, spectral OLR derived from SAT‐2 has better agreement with other collocated measurements than that from SAT‐1, which can be attributed to the higher noisy performance of the SAT‐1 instrument."

Based on 23 years (2001–2023) of multiple observational data sets, our study provides the first comprehensive observational assessment of RCE applicability over the TP. We find that the TP exhibits a pronounced annual‐mean energy imbalance (−15.9 W/m2), characterized by strong seasonal asymmetry. Summers show intense positive energy imbalance (+56.0 W/m2) driven by latent heating from precipitation, while winters show extreme radiative cooling (−71.8 W/m2). Transitional months (April/September) alone achieve transient energy balance. The TP manifests four energy imbalance regimes, categorized by precipitation intensity and radiative cooling thresholds. These regimes transition seasonally, with Strong Precipitation‐Weak Cooling dominating summer monsoonal regions and Weak Precipitation‐Strong Cooling prevailing in winter and autumn. Daily near‐RCE conditions occur transiently with only 5%–10% frequency across all spatiotemporal scales, contrasting sharply with tropical regions where equilibrium emerges through spatial aggregation. Analysis of extreme events reveals that intense latent heating drives a positive imbalance during summer heating events, which is compensated primarily by enhanced vertical dry static energy divergence. Persistent radiative cooling creates a sustained negative imbalance during winter cooling events, which is countered by vertical divergence of dry static energy flux and meridional cold air advection. These results challenge the direct application of tropical RCE paradigms to the TP region and highlight the need for a skewed RCE framework that explicitly incorporates the TP's unique thermal forcing effects."

However, uncertainties in hydrological models and a lack of consideration for HWLM in climate models have limited the estimation and attribution of the changes in global‐scale flood risks. Based on a multi‐model ensemble of daily discharge simulations and projections from the latest Inter‐Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP 3), our estimation shows that flood risks significantly increased (slightly decreased) in the north (south) of 50°N during 1971–2019 when considering the combined effects of ACC and HWLM. Under continuing global warming (from 1.5°C to 3°C), 59.6%–69.4% of the global land area would witness an increasing flood risk, with 71.9%–87.5% of basin‐level risks attributable to anthropogenic activities, particularly in arid/tropical zones. Meanwhile, the flood risk in 38.8% of the global land area shows the anthropogenic signals before 2065. This increase is enlarged by greater flood magnitude and variability in the future, with flood magnitude being the dominant factor in most regions. We suggest that hydrological services and policymakers should implement adaptive strategies that consider anthropogenic increases in flood magnitude and variability, utilizing detected signals to guide global flood‐risk mitigation."

 Clonally expanded CD4+ T-cells harboring rebound-competent HIV persist lifelong during ART1-5. Latency is considered the principal barrier to viral eradication and has resisted pharmacological reversal6,7, yet sustained immune pressure appears to erode reservoirs8-15. Recent advances have yielded glimpses into exceptionally rare reservoir-harboring cells, implicating pro-survival properties in persistence16-18. Here, we isolate and characterize authentic reservoir clones (ARCs) that robustly proliferate and accumulate while producing infectious virus, without overtly succumbing to cytopathicity. At any moment, only small fractions of ARCs expressed HIV proteins, a state associated with conserved host transcriptional programs but remarkably refractory to potent T-cell stimulation. Nevertheless, sustained co-culture with a CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone substantially culled proliferating ARCs, revealing time-integrated vulnerability to immune pressure. The corresponding ex vivo CD8+ T-cell response was poorly cytotoxic and in vivo erosion of ARCs occurred only slowly.

 Mott materials are archetypal quantum systems actively explored as next-generation electronic and photonic platforms, with potential applications spanning non-Von Neumann computing, robotics, energy storage, and microwave technologies. Among these, vanadium dioxide (VO2) has emerged as one of the most intensively studied compounds, owing to its sharp, near-room-temperature insulator-to-metal phase transition. VO2 also serves as a benchmark system for testing cutting-edge theories and experimental techniques. Here, we directly visualize the electrically driven transition dynamics in VO2 using a microwave-driven, frequency-tunable pulsed transmission electron microscope that combines nanometer spatial and picosecond temporal resolution. Under high-frequency (MHz–GHz) excitation, we capture the ultrafast nucleation, propagation, and dissolution of metallic domains within an operating device over millions of reversible cycles. We observe the ultrafast formation of consistent metallic nuclei beneath the electrodes, followed by the propagation of a structural phase front at 4.54 nm/ns. Our experiments show that phonon-mediated structural recovery ultimately limits reversible switching of VO2 at GHz frequencies, and that a tunable regime for reversible operation spans from kHz to GHz through device engineering. Beyond VO2, our approach provides a powerful framework for probing non-equilibrium structural transformations in correlated and functional materials under realistic electrical stimuli.

 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the abnormal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow and is closely associated with systemic light chain amyloidosis (AL), a disease triggered by the amyloid aggregation of antibody light chain (LC). High-resolution structures of amyloid LC fibrils from MM patients remain largely unexplored. Here, we extracted LC amyloid fibrils directly from abdominal fat biopsies of two living MM patients. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we further determined the structures of three distinct LC fibril morphologies, which differ significantly from previously reported fibril structures derived from AL amyloidosis patients. Structural comparisons and computational analyses suggested distinct LC fibrillation mechanisms in MM compared to AL amyloidosis, highlighting a potential role of elevated protein concentration in driving LC aggregation in MM. These findings provide essential molecular insights into LC fibril formation in MM and offer a structural foundation for biological diagnosis of living MM patients based on accessible abdominal fat biopsy samples.

Here, the authors identify DNA-PK as a key kinase mediating STAT6 phosphorylation in murine and human macrophages and show that this post-translational modification is required to prevent macrophage senescence and protects animals from senescence-driven lung fibrosis and aging. 
 Macrophage senescence drives inflammaging, a chronic, age-related inflammation. To date, the protective mechanisms against inflammaging are poorly defined. Here, we identify DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of murine STAT6 at serine 807 (Ser807) as a crucial post-translational modification for preventing macrophage senescence. Ser807 phosphorylation blocks STAT6 ubiquitination-mediated degradation and promotes STAT6 partnering with PU.1 to activate DNA repair genes. Macrophages lacking Ser807 phosphorylation exhibit DNA repair defects, undergo senescence, and fuel inflammaging. In vivo, the phosphor-null STAT6 mutant (STAT6(S807A)) accelerates macrophage senescence, tissue fibrosis, and systemic aging. Adoptive transfer of phosphomimetic STAT6(S807E)-expressing macrophages rescues accelerated aging. Importantly, phosphorylation of human STAT6 at the homologous residue (Ser817) is significantly reduced in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), correlating with increased DNA damage and senescence. Thus, our findings reveal a DNA-PK-STAT6 axis enacting a non-canonical type 2 immunity via DNA repair to prevent macrophage senescence, presenting a therapeutic target for healthy aging. STAT6 mitigates cellular aging and senescence by regulating the expression of DNA repair genes. However, the upstream signals driving the activation of this non-canonical STAT6 function have not been identified.

Zhu and colleagues show that the transcription factor Foxl1 impacts key events during the epithelial transition of the fetal mammalian gut. 
 The primitive gut tube of mammals initially forms as a simple cylinder consisting of the endoderm-derived, pseudostratified epithelium and the mesoderm-derived surrounding mesenchyme. During mid-gestation, a dramatic transformation occurs in which the epithelium is both restructured into its final cuboidal form and simultaneously folded and refolded to create intestinal villi and intervillus regions. Here, we show that the mesenchymal winged helix transcription factor Foxl1, itself induced by epithelial hedgehog signaling, controls villification by activating BMP and PDGFRα and the planar cell polarity factor Fat4 in epithelial-adjacent telocyte progenitors either directly or indirectly. In the absence of Foxl1-dependent mesenchymal signaling, villus formation and the separation of epithelial cells into mitotic intervillus and postmitotic villus are delayed, and the differentiation of secretory progenitors temporarily blocked. Thus, Foxl1 orchestrates key events during the epithelial transition of the fetal mammalian gut. The mammalian gut undergoes a dramatic transformation during mid-gestation to create intestinal villi.

Here, the authors show that vibronic interactions survive at room temperature in disordered light-harvesting aggregates, challenging the view that disorder inhibits energy transport. 
 Photosynthesis relies on a network of chlorophyll-like molecules which together lead to efficient long-range energy transfer. Evidence at cryogenic temperatures suggests that mechanistic details of energy/charge transfer must invoke coupled vibrational-electronic (vibronic) states. Whether these survive at physiological temperature in large photosynthetic aggregates is an open question. Parallel research on artificial templates has relied on cyanines which are unlike chlorophylls. Here we report time-resolved optical spectra of porphyrin nanotubes where we selectively probe coupled Qx − Qy states through polarization control. Early time cross peaks between electronic states, their rapid broadening and survival of quantum beats with anisotropic beating amplitude conclusively demonstrate that overlapping vibrational-electronic bands of photosynthetic aggregates indeed host functional vibronic couplings at room temperature. Calculations reveal that disorder is the vital ingredient that dramatically enhances intraband vibronic couplings across the entire Q band. The parameter regime where energetic disorder is of the order of dense Raman-active vibrations with weak reorganization energies may be the key design principle. Influence of quantum effects on energy transport is an open question. Here, the authors show that vibronic interactions survive at room temperature in disordered light-harvesting aggregates, challenging the view that disorder inhibits energy transport."

 Pathogenic CD4+ memory T cells (Tm) sustain chronic inflammation, but mechanisms remain undefined. Here, we identify four donor-type CD4+ Tm subsets in the target tissues of autoimmune-like chronic graft-versus-host disease in mice: Ly108+CD69− stem-like memory T cells (Tsm), Ly108+CD69+ resident memory progenitor T cells (Trmp), Ly108−CD69+ terminally differentiated tissue-resident T cells (Trm), and Ly108−CD69− intermediate T cells (Tint). Trm are terminally differentiated but not exhausted and show highly biased clonotypes with high proinflammatory cytokine expression. Tsm cells require TCR-MHCII interactions for their maintenance and expansion and show greater capacity than Trmp cells in self-renewal/expansion, generation of Trm, and pathogenicity in adoptive recipients. The transcription factors TCF1/BCL6 and BHLHE40 differentially regulate the stemness and differentiation of Tsm into Trm, respectively, and their selective targeting reduces the number of Trm in tissues and ameliorates inflammation. Thus, our findings indicate that targeting the Tsm subset, involved in the maintenance of the pathogenic Tm pool, offers an attractive approach to treat T cell-mediated chronic inflammation.

 Sticky-ended cohesion has been the driving force for DNA self-assembly and has enabled model and design programmability in DNA nanotechnology for over 40 years. Traditional units within self-assembled crystals have rationally-designed sticky ends to avoid unpredictable packing behavior, but in doing so, the surprising variety of contact flavors available to natural nucleic acids remains unexploited. Here, we employ composable DNA tiles to form complex 3D architectures using blunt-ended motifs with single duplex interfaces, thereby leveraging the geometry of the tile and the terminal nucleobase identity to control self-assembly outcomes.

We establish programmability and tunable packing, including translational and inversion symmetries, 5’−3’ and 5’−5’ stacking, and both positive and negative helical twist values. Finally, we establish the ability of racemic mixtures of L- and D-DNA motifs to perform programmable co-assembly driven by terminal π–π interactions, demonstrating molecular recognition and coexistence between mirror molecular systems.

This study examines how protest repression shapes climate activism and indicates distinct effects across collective action types and repression experience, with emotions as mediators. 
 As climate activism has expanded, governments have increasingly repressed disruptive but non-violent protests. Yet evidence remains mixed regarding whether repression inhibits or galvanizes activism. In this study, we examine how anticipated and experienced repression predict intentions to engage in normative (rule-conforming) and non-normative (rule-violating) collective climate action, over and above past activism and core psychological antecedents. Survey data from Extinction Rebellion UK mailing list subscribers (n = 1,375) showed that experienced repression positively predicted non-normative action intentions and showed a positive indirect predictive effect on non-normative action via reduced fear. Although anticipated repression was not directly associated with either action type, it had positive indirect predictive effects on both action types via anger/outrage and on non-normative action via contempt. Conversely, it also had a negative indirect predictive effect on non-normative action through heightened fear. These findings predominantly reflect a galvanizing effect of repression on disruptive collective climate action among committed activists.

Focusing on relevance, quality and diversity, researchers develop a simple and transparent weighting framework to address these challenges. 
 Integrated assessment models produce large ensembles of socioeconomic scenarios that are used profusely in climate change research. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), non-governmental organizations or national climate committees often rely on ensemble statistics to identify mitigation strategies and set climate targets. A limitation of such evidence is the opportunistic nature of scenario ensembles: they are an unstructured, serendipitous collection of evidence. Drawing on concepts from physical climate science and ensemble analysis, we present an approach for the flexible, multidimensional weighting of emission scenario data that accounts for relevance, quality and diversity. Our illustrative application to the latest IPCC scenario database demonstrates a reduction in dominance of highly represented models and studies, and sees net-zero emission milestones differ to those originally reported. Our framework formalizes decisions otherwise made in an ad hoc manner, providing a tool contributing to the broader challenge of assessing ensembles of opportunity.

This work proposes a ‘multi-zonal anammox’ concept that can be incorporated into existing wastewater treatment plants. 
 Biological nitrogen removal is a main contributor to the carbon footprint of municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs). Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is key to decarbonizing MWWTPs. However, anammox technology has long been developed following the ‘hotspot’ concept, which spatially confines anammox to specific zones in MWWTPs, leaving its potential underexploited in mainstream treatment. Here we propose a ‘multi-zonal anammox’ concept to expand the anammox process throughout the whole MWWTP mainstream. It allows the implementation of anammox in existing MWWTPs with minimal reconstruction requirements. We evaluated the feasibility of this concept in an anaerobic–anoxic–oxic (A2O) biosystem, which is one of the most widely used processes in MWWTPs. During a 2-year-long operation, anammox bacteria highly self-enriched and contributed to nitrogen removal throughout the mainstream, with relative abundances reaching 4.8%, 5.7–10.0% and 0.2–1.0% in anaerobic, anoxic and oxic zones, respectively. The multi-zonal anammox enhanced nitrogen removal efficiency by 20%, reduced aerating electricity input by 20%, mitigated nitrous oxide emissions by 66% and eliminated the need for supplemental organic carbon. Overall, this work opens a promising avenue for implementing the anammox process, paving the way towards sustainable wastewater management.

 Bromine (Br), mostly extracted from nature, plays an essential role in the form of organobromides in various goods, including electronics, vehicles and furniture. At the same time, Br is continuously released into the environment in the form of persistent brominated pollutants upon the retirement of those goods, causing severe environmental consequences and loss of resources. Here we propose a catalytic strategy that enables the selective and mild-condition conversion of all organobromides present in wastes into renewed bromides for Br recycling. It employs Ullmann-type reactions enabled by inexpensive Cu(I), simple ligands and hydroxides in DMSO–H2O solvent. This strategy achieved >95% bromide yields at a temperature ≤120 °C for complex real-world Br-laden wastes. It can produce bromide-rich solution amenable to Br2 production, as demonstrated by the inorganicization–evaporation–oxidation process, and recoverable debrominated solids with preserved chemical states. Mechanistic studies revealed a full debromination framework encompassing diverse activated pathways. This work provides a viable approach for Br recycling and potentially facilitates a circular and sustainable anthropogenic Br flow.

This work presents a water-soluble binder that enables the fast separation of active materials from current collectors in aqueous solutions for sustainable recycling of electrode materials. 
 The substantial growth in the market for lithium-ion batteries has created a huge challenge for their end-of-life management and demands sustainable solutions. Direct recycling is a promising choice due to its superior energy efficiency and environmental benefits, particularly the advantage in preserving the original chemistry and structure of the target materials. However, binders hold the active electrode materials and the current collectors tightly together, and their separation usually involves energy-intensive thermal treatment and environmentally hazardous chemicals. Here we present a water-soluble binder by crosslinking natural sericin protein with sulfuric acid through supramolecular interactions. The as-fabricated binder demonstrates comparable electrochemical performance with the most common polyvinylidene fluoride formulation, when applied to a typical LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) cathode. A 1.3-Ah pouch cell retained 85.0% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles. Equally importantly, after being soaked in water at 50 °C for less than 1 min, the NCM111 and graphite can be completely detached from the current collectors for recycling. By integrating the circular economy into the battery design, this work paves the way for the development of next-generation battery chemistries with enhanced sustainability.

 Maintaining thermal comfort sustainably is critical to reduce the share of global energy used for heating and cooling. However, current radiative materials for personal thermal management typically offer a singular direction of operation (either heating or cooling), lacking intelligent and sustainable adaptability to fluctuating environments. Here we report an all-solid-state autonomous colour-changing skin (ACCS) that integrates both solar heating and radiative cooling within a single energy-efficient platform. Inspired by the adaptive behaviour of chameleon skin, the ACCS enables continuous modulation of emissivity across the solar (0.3–2.5 µm) and mid-infrared (8–13 µm) spectra. The device tunes solar absorptivity by ~40% and infrared emissivity by over 50% under a voltage bias of only ±1.3 V, maintaining each state for more than 24 h without power consumption. Outdoor tests revealed reversible temperature differences of up to 15.5 °C between heating and cooling modes, while a single smartphone battery can power over 200 full-range switching cycles. The solution-processable functional layers permit scalable fabrication via drop-casting and roll-to-roll techniques, extending applications from wearable devices to large-area environmental control. This flexible, energy-neutral platform advances adaptive personal thermoregulation and illustrates how multispectral electrochromic design can decouple human comfort from fossil fuel-based climate control, contributing to global sustainability goals.

 Antarctic fast ice is essential for ice shelf stability and the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water, which are critical for global ocean circulation. Despite its importance, the variability of fast ice has not been extensively studied. Here, we investigate the influence of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on fast ice variability in March. We find that circum-Antarctic fast ice variability in March is significantly associated with the strength of SAM in the previous September, particularly in the regions of Dronning Maud Land (DML), the Amundsen Sea (AS), and the Australian sector (Aus). In DML and AS, positive SAM induces northward sea ice drift near the coast, which can contribute to reduced surrounding sea ice during spring. This sea ice loss is further amplified by increased net solar radiation associated with reduced albedo. In turn, ocean swell near the coast increases during summer, contributing to the reduction of fast ice in March. In contrast, fast ice variability in the Aus region is less linked to coastal sea ice loss. Instead, in this region, where north–south-oriented coastal features are prominent, fast ice formation is associated with westward pack ice advection driven by the Antarctic Coastal Current. Positive SAM enhances eastward sea ice drift, hindering westward ice advection and reducing springtime fast ice, ultimately leading to decreased fast ice in March."

 Many European lakes have suffered oxygen declines from recent eutrophication raising the question as to which conditions are representative of their pre-impact state. Here we present a palaeoecological record revealing that deepwater oxygen in small lakes can be variable over long timescales and subject to human influence for millennia. Remains of chironomids and other invertebrates indicate that Bichelsee (Switzerland) shifted from a stable, oxygen-rich to a dynamic, oxygen-poor state before major human activity. Initially, increased human activity and clearcutting coincided with improved oxygen conditions for deepwater midge larvae. However, from the Roman Age onwards, similar disturbances were associated with low oxygen and reduced deepwater invertebrate populations. These results demonstrate that small European lakes can have multiple, contrasting pre-impact reference states, and that ecological effects of human activity, even their directionality, may shift over time. Furthermore, repeated cycles of impact and recovery can occur over millennia, complicating assumptions about their baseline conditions.

 The formation mechanism of arc mafic rocks with heavy iron isotope signature remains enigmatic. Here we report Fe-Mo-Sr-Nd-Hf isotope data of arc rocks from Northeast China. The studied arc rocks have δ56Fe values (0.08‰ to 0.23‰) comparable to or higher than those of mid-oceanic-ridge basalts, and enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotope compositions. Combined with the published data of global arc mafic rocks, we find there is a correlation between the δ56Fe values and radiogenic Sr-Nd isotopes, indicating that sediment recycling may have affected the iron isotope of arc rocks. Notably, the positive correlation between the δ56Fe and δ98Mo values further suggests that the metasomatism of mantle wedge peridotite by anoxic sediment-derived melts may be the first-order control for the heavy iron isotopes of arc mafic rocks. Therefore, the arc rocks with heavy iron isotopes can be explained by the addition of anoxic sediments to their mantle sources.

 Accurate representation of terrestrial water storage is essential for water resource management and climate adaptation, yet model‑observation inconsistencies hinder global water cycle assessment. Here we show, using a unified multi‑scale framework, that seven model products with diverse modeling strategies and varying structural completeness exhibit scale‑dependent performance against Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment observations across global, climate-zone, and basin scales. Globally, hydrological models show the highest temporal correlation (0.94) but underperform spatially (0.32), whereas the assimilation system balances both dimensions with higher spatial agreement (0.73). Across climate zones, the assimilation system maintains robust performance, while physical models degrade in polar regions (−0.40). From large to small basin scales, hydrological model performance deteriorates systematically, whereas the assimilation system retains higher consistency and directional accuracy. These findings demonstrate that satellite observation-constrained assimilation substantially reduces inconsistencies relative to model‑driven products, offering essential guidance for climate adaptation and water management strategies.

 Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions drive ocean acidification. Trichodesmium, a key marine nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, displays contrasting growth responses to ocean acidification across morphotypes: negative in filamentous free trichomes but neutral or positive in colonies. However, lacking mechanistic understanding for these discrepancies has impaired our ability to predict Trichodesmium’s ecophysiological response. Here, we develop ecophysiological models to underpin mechanisms behind these divergent responses. For free trichomes, ocean acidification reduces nitrogen-fixing enzyme activity and photosynthetic energy production. In colonies, however, it alleviates copper and ammonia toxicity within the microenvironment—likely synergizing with enhanced iron acquisition—thereby outweighing minor benefit from relieved inorganic carbon limitation in the colony center. Projections suggest that globally, ocean acidification will reduce nitrogen fixation of trichomes by 16 ± 6% but increase that of colonies by 19 ± 24% within this century.

 Sedimentary nitrogen loss is a major sink for nitrogen in marine systems mitigating excess nitrogen inputs, with anammox representing a critical pathway. Conventional understanding holds that anammox bacteria exclusively mediate ammonium oxidation, while their capacity for anaerobic urea oxidation (AUO) has remained largely overlooked. Here we present the direct measurements of AUO rates and contributions across China’s marginal sea sediments, using a revised 15N isotope pairing technique. AUO exhibited a lower rate, accounting for 15 ± 10% of anammox. Moreover, porewater ammonium concentration emerged as a key regulator of AUO contribution due to substrate competition. Extrapolation to a global scale suggests that AUO accounts for ~7% of total sedimentary nitrogen loss, with a disproportionately high contribution in deep-sea sediments. These findings identify AUO as a previously overlooked but globally relevant nitrogen loss pathway, underscoring the need to incorporate AUO and other anaerobic dissolved organic nitrogen transformations into marine nitrogen budgets.

 Addressing the limited compatibility, generalizability, and interpretability of prevailing methods for evaluating the cooling effects of urban blue–green spaces (BGS), this study proposes a Land Surface Temperature Parameterization Method (LSTPM). Based on local temperature gradients and divergence, LSTPM physically characterizes the dominant cooling influence of BGS to derive four indicators: cooling intensity (CI), cooling distance (CD), cooling efficiency (CE), and cooling gradient (CG). Using 208 BGS within Beijing's Sixth Ring Road and multi-temporal Landsat imagery, we compare LSTPM with the Buffer Method (BM) and Gaussian Model Method (GMM). Results indicate that: (1) The BM was the most permissive, identifying valid cooling effects in over 60% of samples across all seasons, whereas the GMM was the most conservative and unstable. (2) Numerically, LSTPM and BM showed strong consistency in CI (r = 0.68 in summer) but diverged significantly in CD (r = 0.17), highlighting LSTPM's distinct spatial delineation capabilities. (3) Validity tests using built-up land as a negative control demonstrated that LSTPM offered the strongest discrimination, whereas the BM frequently misclassified built-up areas as cooling sources. (4) Sensitivity analysis revealed that while the BM is highly robust (CI relative change <18% under 0.3σ noise), the LSTPM is more sensitive to data quality (CI change up to 71.5%). Consequently, LSTPM is best suited for precise, explanatory analyses with high-quality data; the BM for general, robust applications; and the GMM for small-sample exploratory modeling.

 Remote sensing text–image retrieval (RSTIR) aims to retrieve the matched remote sensing (RS) images from the database according to the descriptive text. Recently, the rapid development of large visual-language pre-training models provides new insights for RSTIR. Nevertheless, as the complexity of models grows in RSTIR, the previous studies suffer from suboptimal resource efficiency during transfer learning. To address this issue, we propose a computation and memory-efficient retrieval (CMER) framework for RSTIR. To reduce the training memory consumption, we propose the Focus-Adapter module, which adopts a side branch structure. Its focus layer suppresses the interference of background pixels for small targets. Simultaneously, to enhance data efficacy, we regard the RS scene category as the metadata and design a concise augmentation technique. The scene label augmentation leverages the prior knowledge from land cover categories and shrinks the search space. We propose the negative sample recycling strategy to make the negative sample pool decoupled from the mini-batch size. It improves the generalization performance without introducing additional encoders. We have conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on public datasets and expanded the benchmark with some advanced approaches, which demonstrates the competitiveness of the proposed CMER. Compared with the recent advanced methods, the overall retrieval performance of CMER is 2%–5% higher on RSITMD. Moreover, our proposed method reduces memory consumption by 49% and has a 1.4x data throughput during training. The code of the CMER and the dataset will be released at [Link]."

 In the framework of vegetation modelling, the accurate representation of spatial heterogeneity is a challenge for remotely sensed radiative transfer models (RTMs). On the one hand, one-dimensional RTMs are highly realistic on homogeneous surfaces but have limitations when modelling complex structures, while three-dimensional RTMs, although physically detailed, have a high computational cost and greater complexity in parameterisation. In this paper, we present the SILVO (Simplified Light-Vegetation Overlay) model as a streamlined ray-tracing tool that allows the generation of basic spatial metrics (gap fraction, scene vegetation density) on a geometrical representation of the canopy. The model is driven by a simplified scene description and solar illumination conditions, and has been implemented in parallel with OpenMP to provide a computationally efficient solution. The results obtained in a real heterogeneous forest scene demonstrate the ability of the model to capture the essential aspects of the canopy’s spatial structure, facilitating the extension of 1D RTMs for more realistic representations of heterogeneous canopies. An indicative comparison with LiDAR-derived structural proxies is also reported (R2 = 0.774 for vertical vegetation density; NRMSE = 11.7% for gap fraction), while acknowledging that this does not constitute a full validation exercise.

Here we benchmarked Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) footprint canopy-height metrics and two GEDI-derived global canopy-height products (GFCH 2019 and GCH 2020) using a 1 m UAV-LiDAR canopy height model acquired along a ∼ 2,000 m elevational transect in the central Himalayas, Nepal. We show that GEDI RH95, paired with the UAV P95 reference in a like-with-like percentile comparison, reproduces the overall canopy-height distribution with minimal systematic bias but substantial footprint-scale dispersion, with errors that are spatially structured by terrain and sub-footprint heterogeneity. A footprint-shift experiment indicates that plausible horizontal misregistration contributes comparatively little to overall uncertainty reinforcing that topography and within-footprint variability dominate the error budget in this setting. At the map scale, GFCH 2019 captures broad elevational patterns but systematically underestimates tall canopy heights and exhibits terrain-dependent residual structure, whereas GCH 2020 shows widespread positive bias and spatially patchy coverage over the LiDAR-mapped domain. Together, these results provide a rare UAV-LiDAR benchmark for interpreting GEDI footprint heights and GEDI-derived canopy height models in a data-scarce, high-relief mountain forest, and highlight the need for terrain-aware uncertainty characterization and local calibration when these products are used for biomass, habitat, and treeline/upper-montane applications."

 Accurate road extraction from remote sensing imagery is vital for urban planning and intelligent transportation. However, its accuracy is often limited by complex backgrounds, spectral ambiguity, and diverse road shapes. Recent deep learning methods have made strong progress, including topology-aware designs that explicitly encourage structural consistency; however, performance can still degrade under weak textures, occlusion, and rapidly changing orientations, where thin roads become fragmented and boundaries blur. To address these limitations, RoadAttNet is developed to enhance road network integrity and boundary delineation. The architecture integrates multidimensional physical priors through a learnable weighting mechanism. Furthermore, an Oriented Coordinate Attention (OCA) module is incorporated to reinforce directional continuity and refine boundary precision via oriented pooling operations. Feature representation and training stability are further optimized through an adaptive deep supervision strategy. Quantitative evaluations on the Massachusetts and Lanzhou datasets demonstrate the superiority of RoadAttNet over existing benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods such as MSMDFF-Net, the proposed architecture achieves improvements of up to 2.3% in IoU and 1.43% in F1-score. Additionally, the clDice connectivity metric increases by 2.1%, indicating a substantial reduction in network fragmentation and enhanced topological consistency.

 Flood risk in mountainous regions is expected to intensify under the compounding effects of climate change, population growth, and land cover changes. However, there is limited understanding of how these interacting factors will shape future flood risk, particularly in the transboundary and ecologically sensitive Kabul River Basin (KRB). The present study addresses this critical gap by assessing the spatiotemporal patterns of projected flood susceptibility in the KRB from 2020 to 2100 under different future scenarios. Future flood susceptibility was predicted using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model with three dynamic and nine static predictors. The findings indicate a significant shift in flood susceptibility over time. Specifically, the areas classified as “Very Highly” susceptible increased from 11.78% in 2020 to 12.17% in 2040, 14.44% in 2060, 13.32% in 2080, and 13.51% by 2100, while the areas classified as “Very Low” susceptibility steadily declined from 66.17% in 2020 to 56.43% by 2100. The XGBoost model showed strong predictive accuracy (AUC: 0.961–0.962) and high cross-temporal consistency across future scenarios (Correlation: 0.75–0.85), confirming its suitability for flood susceptibility assessment. Bootstrap uncertainty analysis further supported its robustness, with mean AUCs of 0.9817–0.9834, very low standard errors (0.0003), and narrow confidence intervals (0.9719–0.9887). These results underscore the need to integrate dynamic environmental and demographic changes into flood management strategies in KRB. The research offers a transferable outline for flood assessment in climate-sensitive mountainous regions. It provides actionable insights for land use planning and climate adaptation policy aimed at reducing future flood impacts."

 Urban commuting flow prediction is crucial for optimizing public transportation and improving efficiency, yet traditional models often focus on geographic adjacency, overlooking the complex cross-regional interactions within transportation networks. To address this, we propose a Geography-Aware Graph Neural Network (GAGNN) model for commuting flow prediction. The model first jointly encodes the geographic adjacency matrix and semantic adjacency from public transportation networks, developing a comprehensive attention mechanism to fuse regional proximity with cross-regional semantic connectivity. Subsequently, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) is employed to embed the multiple adjacency relations and multi-source geographic knowledge. Finally, graph embeddings are combined with spatial factors into multidimensional feature vectors, fed into an MLP for commuting flow prediction. The model was validated with Fuzhou workday mobile phone data from January to February 2023, assessing the impact of semantic adjacency from different transportation networks on performance. The results show that: (1) We proposed the GAGNN outperforms both traditional models and advanced graph neural network models (e.g., GSGNN), reducing MAE by 14.9% and improving CPC by 2.1%; (2) The type of semantic adjacency significantly impacts model prediction accuracy. Road-based semantic connections perform best, especially for long-distance commuting flows, followed by metro and bus semantic connections, while the absence of semantic connections yields the worst performance. (3) Spatial scale significantly affects model prediction performance. Under road-based semantic adjacency, accuracy slightly declines with increasing scale, whereas metro, bus, and non-semantic connections, prediction accuracy improves. These findings offer effective support for accurate regional commuting flow modeling and public transportation networks optimization."

 Although the adverse health effects of particulate matter (PM) are often considered in terms of mass and particle size, a growing number of studies now focus on new health metrics such as the oxidative potential (OP) of PM, highlighting the role of certain metals, among them copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) for their capacity to impact OP levels in ambient air. In this study, we built on a previously-developed European anthropogenic emission inventory for Cu, Fe and Mn to simulate PM10 concentrations of these metals within PM10 during a two-year period with the WRF-CHIMERE chemistry transport model, applying a source-tagging method. We also estimated the contribution of erosion dust (mostly of African origin) and urban dust (mostly road and construction dust) as significant sources for each of these metals.For validation purpose, we compared the simulation results with a large database of measurements collected from various sources and locations. The medians of the fractional mean biases for Cu are close to zero for both rural and urban background sites, indicating that the emission in the inventory adequately represent atmospheric Cu concentrations. However, the biases are highly negative for Fe and Mn in a simulation when only considering anthropogenic emissions. The correlation coefficients obtained for (rural and urban) background stations range from 0.4 to 0.6, with urban sites showing slightly higher correlations for Fe but slightly lower ones for Cu and Mn. The inclusion of desert dust sources improves the correlation for some rural stations, while including local urban dust has a less pronounced effect. However, neither source fully explains the significant biases for Fe and Mn concentrations. Overall, this study calls for further works to try and elucidate the missing sources of Fe and Mn, revisit our previously developed emission inventory, and refine the share of PM resuspension to ambient air concentrations of key metallic compounds."

 Air pollution poses a significant environmental risk, necessitating effective mitigation and management strategies. The Yellow River Basin (YRB), being a critical region for air pollution control, as it contains 20 cities with the poorest air quality in China, making it one of the area's most severely affected by smog pollution. Understanding the spatiotemporal variations, extreme events, and abrupt changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD) across the YRB is crucial for optimizing measures for air pollution prevention and control measures. This study employs a comprehensive approach, utilizing Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis, Mann-Kendall tests, HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT), and circulation field synthesis to investigate AOD variations across different subregions of the YRB from 2000 to 2023. Result reveals a significant abrupt change in 2019, marking a transition from an increasing to decreasing trend. Regionally, AOD slightly increased in the western part, while notable decrease was observed in the central and eastern parts. Among different pollutants, dust contributed the most to AOD, followed by SO2, SO4, and OC, with sea salt and BC are contributing the least. At the synoptic scale, air masses originating from the eastern regions of YRB contributed to higher AOD values, whereas those from the western contributed to lower values. Furthermore, air subsidence under high–pressure control and low planetary boundary layer height (excluding western YRB) hampered vertical diffusion, and failed to explain observed AOD change, underscoring the substantial influence of human interventions. Anthropogenic emissions and policy interventions are significant drivers of AOD variations, indicating that targeted interventions need to be done to improve the air quality."

 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are hazardous air pollutants with significant environmental justice (EJ) implications for communities located near industrial zones. In this study, we deployed an integrated monitoring framework combining online thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS), proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-QMS), and targeted offline sampling to characterize toxic VOCs in an EJ community adjacent to two industrial complexes. A total of 86 toxic VOCs were monitored at high temporal resolution over one month, supported by inter-comparison with offline canisters and PTR-QMS validation. Our study underscores the value of real-time plume detection, which is indispensable for two purposes: facilitating source investigation and accurately assessing health risks. Time-resolved measurements revealed frequent episodic plumes that are often missed by offline methods, with benzene, vinyl chloride, and carbon tetrachloride dominating both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health burdens. For example, benzene contributed approximately 40–45% of the total cancer risk, followed by vinyl chloride (30–35%) and carbon tetrachloride (15–20%). In contrast, risk estimates based on offline canister data were lower by nearly 50–60%, highlighting the substantial underestimation of episodic exposures when relying on canister sampling. Trajectory analysis linked emission spikes to specific industrial sectors, including textile dyeing, plastics, and solvent use, with sorbent sampling confirming sources. The detection of carbon tetrachloride, a banned ozone-depleting substance, underscores its persistent emissions. This integrated monitoring approach demonstrates the critical role of high-resolution VOC data in health risk assessment, pollution forensics, and targeted mitigation in vulnerable EJ communities."

 Understanding the response of the global hydrological cycle to anthropogenic warming is critical for advancing water resources management and mitigating hydrological risks. This study employs a multi-model ensemble from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to quantify projected changes in key global hydrological components, including evaporation, precipitation, total column water vapor (TCWV), and ocean-to-land moisture transport, under medium-emission (SSP2–4.5) and high-emission (SSP5–8.5) scenarios. Our analysis demonstrates a robust and progressively intensifying hydrological cycle throughout the 21st century, with substantially stronger changes under SSP5–8.5. Relative to 1995–2014, TCWV increases by 5.5% (2021–2040) and 16.8% (2081–2100) under SSP2–4.5, and by 6.3% and 34.8% under SSP5–8.5. A pronounced land–ocean asymmetry emerges: land regions exhibit more pronounced changes than oceans, with increases in terrestrial precipitation approximately 1.10–1.40 times greater than the corresponding oceanic rates, indicating stronger land amplification. Ocean-to-land moisture transport rises by 6.2% under SSP2–4.5 and 13.5% under SSP5–8.5 by the end of the century, contributing significantly to enhanced land precipitation and highlighting the importance of atmospheric moisture redistribution in shaping continental water availability. This study consolidates the quantitative sensitivity of the global water cycle to emission pathways and provides critical insights to support climate adaptation strategies."

 The distinctive light-absorption properties of elemental carbon (EC) emitted from solid fuel combustion significantly influence both regional and global climate systems. This study investigated the mass absorption efficiency of EC (MAEEC) at 633 nm wavelength using laboratory-simulated biomass and coal combustion combined with carbon analysis. Diagnostic ratios of carbon components, including EC/PM2.5, organic carbon (OC)/EC, and char-EC/soot-EC, were investigated to characterize the difference in crop residue, wood, and coal combustion emissions. The average MAEEC values varied significantly among fuel types, with crop residue burning showing the highest value (11.2 ± 3.2 m2 g−1), followed by coal combustion (5.5 ± 2.2 m2 g−1) and wood burning (3.0 ± 0.9 m2 g−1). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that OC/EC ratio was the primary factor influencing MAEEC values, possibly attributed to the lensing effect of OC coating. An optical emission inventory of EC from residential solid fuel combustion in the Guanzhong Plain was further developed using our experimentally determined MAEEC, referenced mass emission factors of EC, and county-level activity data to quantify regional optical impacts. These results should advance the understanding of EC radiative effects from residential solid fuel combustion and provide crucial scientific evidence for developing targeted emission reduction policies."
