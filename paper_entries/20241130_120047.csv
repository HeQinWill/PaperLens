10.1088/1748-9326/ad8c6d,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是沿海地区洪水风险在季风期和季风后期的差异性研究。它采用了一维二维耦合洪水模型，结合降雨和风暴潮的复合作用，生成高分辨率的洪水灾害图，并考虑了易受洪水影响的物理和社会经济指标，在最精细的行政尺度上绘制了洪水脆弱性图。研究中引入了两个新的指标：（a）面积指数和（b）多灾害风险指数，以推进对季风期和季风后期洪水风险多灾害性质的理解。总的来说，这是一项关于洪水风险评估和管理的科研工作，与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。,[],Dev Anand Thakur;Mohit Prakash Mohanty,Do disparities exist in flood risks during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons? Comprehending diametric behaviors over coastal multi-hazard catchments,"Global coastal catchments experience peculiar flood risk attributes due to the confluence of multiple flood drivers. In these regions, the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons impose diverse flood risks that evoke meticulous research for the prudent execution of appropriate flood management options. For the first time in flood management literature, we develop an integrated approach to quantify the distinguishing nature of flood risks during both seasons. We employ a sophisticated 1D–2D coupled flood model to generate high-resolution flood hazards while considering the compound interactions between rainfalls and storm-tides. Flood vulnerability is mapped at the finest administrative scale while considering flood-susceptible physical and socio-economic indicators. With the concept of Bivariate Risk Classifier, we introduce two novel metrics: (a) area index and (b) multi-hazard risk index that advance our understanding of the multi-hazard nature of flood risks during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. These incisive indices propound case-specific flood management measures for long-term resilience."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8f46,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是食物和土地系统转型对可持续发展目标的影响，探讨了不同可持续发展路径下（经济驱动创新、有韧性的社区和全球公共资源管理）粮食、土地利用和环境变化之间的关系。虽然研究涉及温室气体排放、氮污染等大气成分，并可能间接利用卫星观测数据（例如土地利用变化），但其核心并非大气环境遥感技术本身。文章主要关注的是宏观层面的政策和经济模型分析，而非具体的遥感技术和数据分析。因此，与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['Greenhouse gas emissions', 'Nitrogen pollution', 'Air quality', 'Satellite observation (implied)']",Isabelle Weindl;Bjoern Soergel;Geanderson Ambrósio;Vassilis Daioglou;Jonathan Doelman;Felicitas Beier;Arthur Beusen;Benjamin Leon Bodirsky;Astrid Bos;Jan Philipp Dietrich;Florian Humpenöder;Patrick von Jeetze;Kristine Karstens;Sebastian Rauner;Elke Stehfest;Miodrag Stevanović;Willem-Jan van Zeist;Hermann Lotze-Campen;Detlef van Vuuren;Elmar Kriegler;Alexander Popp,Food and land system transformations under different societal perspectives on sustainable development,"The future of food and land systems is crucial for achieving multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals, given their essential role in providing adequate nutrition and their significant impact on Earth system processes. Despite widespread consensus on the need for transformation, discussed strategies vary widely, from technology-driven to sufficiency-focused approaches, emphasizing different agents of change and policy mixes. This study assesses the implications of a new generation of target-seeking scenarios incorporating such diverse sustainability perspectives. We apply two integrated assessment models to explore food and land futures under three whole-economy sustainable development pathways (SDPs): Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons. Our assessment shows that the SDPs align sufficient food supply with progress towards planetary integrity, halting biodiversity loss, mitigating adverse impacts from irrigation, and significantly reducing nitrogen pollution. While all SDPs comply with the Paris climate target, they diverge in the timing of climate mitigation efforts and focus on different greenhouse gases and emission sources. The Economy-driven Innovation pathway rapidly achieves net-negative CO2 emissions from the land system, whereas the pathways Resilient Communities and Managing the Global Commons significantly decrease agricultural non-CO2 emissions. Moreover, sustainability interventions attenuate trade-offs associated with narrowly focused mitigation scenarios and reduce reliance on carbon dioxide removal strategies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8f4a,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了中国水资源有限地区生态系统对突发干旱的响应。利用卫星遥感技术，特别是太阳诱导叶绿素荧光(SIF)和总初级生产力(GPP)数据，评估了2001年至2022年期间突发干旱事件的变化，量化了植被对突发干旱的抵抗力（维持旱前水平的能力）和恢复力（从干旱中恢复的能力）。研究发现，突发干旱的频率和持续时间都在增加，植被的恢复力显著下降。不同植被类型对干旱的抵抗力和恢复力存在差异，并且抵抗力和恢复力之间存在权衡关系。干旱指数、水汽压差和温度是影响植被抵抗力和恢复力的重要环境变量。该研究强调了水资源有效性对陆地生态系统稳定性的影响，使用了遥感技术监测植被状况和干旱，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如利用卫星数据监测大气水汽含量和地表温度等。,"['solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence', 'gross primary productivity', 'vegetation monitoring', 'satellite remote sensing', 'drought monitoring', 'carbon sink', 'atmospheric water vapor', 'land surface temperature']",Tingting Yao;Suxia Liu;Shi Hu;Xingguo Mo,Evaluation of ecosystem’s response to flash drought in water-limited regions of China,"Intensive and frequent flash droughts pose a threat to the stability of terrestrial ecosystems and affect land carbon sinks, particularly in vulnerable water-limited regions. Here, we evaluated variations in flash drought events in water-limited regions of China from 2001 to 2022 and quantified vegetation resistance (its ability to maintain predrought level) and resilience (its capacity to bounce back from droughts) to flash drought based on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and gross primary productivity. The average frequency of flash droughts was approximately 3.5 events per decade and the duration increased significantly by 3 d during 2001–2022. We found that vegetation resistance to flash drought did not show significant temporal changes, while resilience decreased significantly. Spatially, as aridity increased, vegetation resistance gradually decreased while resilience rose. The strong negative correlation between resistance and resilience demonstrated a trade-off in individual climate regions, which varied among different vegetation types. Among eight vegetation types, evergreen needleleaf forest, evergreen broadleaf forest and mixed forest displayed high-resistance and low-resilience, while deciduous needleleaf forest exhibited both high-resistance and high-resilience. Furthermore, we revealed that aridity index, vapor pressure deficit, and temperature were the most relevant environmental variables for both vegetation resistance and resilience, but had opposite effects and different magnitudes. Our findings highlight that the vulnerability and stability of terrestrial ecosystems are decreasing and are affected by water availability."

This study quantifies historical trends in climate metrics affecting apple growth, production, and quality, which remain understudied. Utilizing the high-resolution gridMET dataset, we analyzed trends (1979–2022) in several key metrics across the U.S.—cold degree days, chill portions, last day of spring frost, growing degree days (GDD), extreme heat days (daily maximum temperature >34 °C), and warm nights (daily minimum temperatures >15 °C). We found significant trends across large parts of the U.S. in all metrics, with the spatial patterns consistent with pronounced warming across the western states in summer and winter. Yakima County, WA, Kent County, MI, Wayne County, NY—leading apple-producers—showed significant decreasing trends in cold degree days and increasing trends in GDD and warm fall nights. Yakima county, with over 48 870 acres of apple orchards, showed significant changes in five of the six metrics—earlier last day of spring frost, fewer cold degree days, increasing GDD over the overall growth period, and more extreme heat days and warm nights. These trends could negatively affect apple production by reducing the dormancy period, altering bloom timing, increasing sunburn risk, and diminishing apple appearance and quality. Large parts of the U.S. experience detrimental trends in multiple metrics simultaneously that indicate the potential for compounding negative impacts on the production and quality of apples and other tree fruit, emphasizing the need for developing and adopting adaptation strategies."

However, it is also a regulated toxic substance with a long history of environmental and health impacts. As the mining of both Zn and Cd will need to increase to support the global energy transition, the status of Cd as either a resource or a pollutant has major implications for global supply chains and environmental management. Here, we present a new global, site-specific database and analysis of Cd resources in Zn-bearing mineral deposits and mines. Our database, which exceeds past Cd studies in scope, transparency and replicability is made available in full to support future assessments of Cd and Zn resources, mine production and associated risks. It includes 927 sites subject to detailed geological data compilation and analysis. Collectively, these sites suggest a new global resource estimate of 3.3 Mt Cd (95% confidence interval: 2.7–6.1 Mt). A preliminary geospatial analysis of sites in our database and mine toxicity indicators was also conducted. It shows that: - A human population of approximately 3.27 million live within 10 km of sites containing Cd resources, - ∼31% of the world’s Cd resources sit within 20 km of International Union for the Conservation of Nature protected areas, and - Some 28% of Cd mobilised annually by mining originates from areas hosting seasonal or permanent surface water cover. As ∼27% of Cd resources are in countries that do not refine it, our study highlights the need for further research exploring global Cd trade flows and associated emissions. Heavy metal pollution in mining and metal production regions is an ongoing challenge, and our global dataset refines our understanding of its magnitude and distribution."

In this study, we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of avocado frontier expansion and intensification from 2011 to 2019 and assess their effects on landscape connectivity, focusing on Michoacán, Mexico, the world’s leading avocado exporter. Using high-resolution satellite imagery combined with deep learning based on convolutional neural networks, we delineated avocado orchards and other land use/cover classes, mapped individual avocado tree crowns and irrigation ponds, and identified hotspots of expanding and intensifying avocado production. We used a circuit theory approach to evaluate the effects of avocado expansion and intensification on the connectivity of natural and semi-natural habitats. Our results reveal a rapid increase in avocado orchards, which expanded by 4175 ha—a growth from 27.9% to 37% in area—over the eight-year period. There was also a decline in rainfed agriculture by 3252 ha, and oak-pine forests by 1343 ha. We observed not only the expansion of the avocado frontier into forests but also an intensification of avocado production via increases in high-density plantations, irrigation ponds, and orchards prone to intensive pruning. Moreover, lower-intensity land-use classes, such as rainfed crops, were rapidly converted to avocado orchards. This expansion and intensification have led to increasing isolation of forest fragments. Although we identified routes that could facilitate the movement of species, the dense avocado monocultures continue to threaten the connectivity of natural and semi-natural habitats, causing notable losses of old-growth oak-pine forests and disrupting crucial ecological corridors. Our research underscores the adverse effects of avocado production on land use and landscape connectivity, emphasizing the need for sustainable management practices to ensure the long-term viability of avocado production systems and overall ecosystem functioning."

Although the three characteristics of heatwaves are closely interconnected, they are often studied separately, especially over the Indian subcontinent. Here, we assess the HIDF over India during the period 1961–2023, and show that there exists a systematic East–West asymmetry in their characteristics over northern India. Specifically, we show that a substantial increase (decrease) in HIDF exists over major cities in the western (eastern) parts of North India. For example, Ahmedabad (a city in the western part) shows a 67.5% increase in the likelihood of four-day heatwaves in the recent decades (1991–2023) compared to the reference period 1961–1990. On the other hand, in the city of Patna (in the eastern part), we notice a 78% decrease in the likelihood of four-day heatwaves in the recent decades. Furthermore, we show that the East–West asymmetry in the HIDF is caused by a major climatic mode, i.e. the Atlantic Niño. Overall, our study provides a first insight into the contrasting characteristics of heatwaves over Northern India and their potential drivers. Such information is vital for the design of regionally appropriate adaptation strategies across India."

The 2022 global energy crisis raises questions about how the war affects the energy transition and global climate policy. However, there are limited studies that incorporate its effects into self-consistent projections of alternative scenarios. This scenario study uses two leading macro-economic models and one integrated assessment model to assess how the war in Ukraine and its direct implications—trade restrictions and rising energy prices—affect economies, energy supply and demand trends, emissions and the feasibility of climate policies. The models consistently project that the disruptive responses to the war lead to a shift from fossil fuels (notably natural gas) to renewable energy and a consequent CO2 emission reduction of about 1%–5%, in the period up to 2050, both for the European Union and globally. However, projections differ across models in terms of sectoral and regional contributions to emission reductions. The results are found to be highly sensitive to the expected, yet uncertain persistence of higher fossil energy prices due to the war, which depends on the duration of the conflict, the disruption of global energy supplies and the response of other major fossil fuel exporters."

We explored neural network learning behavior in wheat yield prediction using game theory-based methods (SHapley Additive exPlanations, Shapley-like, cohort Owen), examined data impact on model performance and show optimization approaches. By identifying and removing harmful data samples, we demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. We show that neural networks can learn decision patterns that often align with agronomic causal relationships. Building on these insights we propose a novel approach using an autoencoder to detect statistical implausible decisions, allowing us to flag and correct potential ‘misjudgements’, resulting in an 11% reduction in global model error. The proposed explainability methods can optimize the neural network training process through improved data acquisition and revising the internal learning process. This enhancement presents neural networks as trustworthy simulation agents for agricultural research, capable of supporting new scientific discoveries and assisting in real-world applications."

Such disturbances not only cause species losses but also affect a myriad of ecological processes that are critical for forest recovery. Here, we present the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date (1976–2023) of human impacts on the regenerating tree community (i.e. seedlings, saplings, and juveniles) across tropical rainforests. We examined the response of woody plant (i.e. trees, shrubs and palms) community patterns (e.g. species diversity) and processes (e.g. individual growth and survival) to four major human disturbances: fire, defaunation, logging, and exotic/invasive species. We gathered 773 disturbed vs. non-disturbed comparisons from 99 studies. Exotic/invasive species and fire showed strong negative impacts on the regenerating plant community, causing a decrease in species richness, diversity and abundance in more disturbed areas. Such impacts were especially detrimental to old-growth forest species, which are usually rare and more prone to local extirpation. Time since the last fire had a negative impact on the early phases of the regenerating community recovery. Conversely, most response variables increased in defaunated and logged forests, as these disturbances (e.g. loss of herbivores) increased plant performance. Yet, the loss of seed dispersers seems to have weak effects on most responses. Interestingly, reduced-impact logging activities show effects similar to those of conventional and selective logging. Overall, our results revealed that human disturbances threaten the abundance and diversity of regenerating tropical trees, but tree performance and productivity variables may be favored by some human activities. Although further research is needed to fill persisting knowledge gaps, our findings have valuable ecological and applied implications that can guide urgently needed conservation and restoration strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of human disturbances on forest regeneration."

This emerging research field of climate resilience explores the capability of socio-ecological systems to cope with stresses, maintain functions, and evolve into more desirable systems within stressful climatic and environmental conditions. This synthetic review examines historical and archaeological studies on climate resilience especially concentrating on human societies in the past 5000 years. It highlights that human societies have had a degree of general resilience to climate and environmental stresses over various spatial and temporal scales, which is reflected through the evidence of population growth, agriculture development, settlement expansion and continuing social-economic development in hazard-prone conditions. Many of the cases considered here demonstrate that climate resilience manifests as a profile of resilience loop and scale relationships in different social systems. Multiple and diverse measures have been identified as being helpful in enhancing the resilience level of various social systems, e.g. improvement of infrastructure, knowledge and technology development, and the strengthening of social organization and cooperation. This review emphasizes the necessity and priority of deepening our understanding of long-term resilience dynamics, and it calls for holistic studies in the field of climate resiliology, particularly targeting to effective and efficient resilience measures as well as their transference across time and space."

Here we use multiple sources of observations, reanalysis data, and model simulations to examine the responses of fire activity to climate change over northeastern China in the past two decades. We detected significant positive burned area (BA) trends in this region since 2003 during spring and much stronger interannual variations in BA in the last decade. We then separated the study region into cropland and natural vegetation and found that the increasing BA trends come mainly from agricultural burning. Our results also show that temperature is the dominant driver for BA variations in natural vegetation, whereas agricultural burning is influenced by precipitation, although human activities largely contribute to BA variations due to farming practices and land use and management. Our results further suggest that tropical North Atlantic (TNA) sea surface temperatures (SST) variability regulates the fire weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) in northeastern China through the Rossby wave train from the tropical Atlantic to the Eurasian continent. The cooling of TNA SST since 2010 could induce an anomalous anticyclonic circulation around Northeast Asia, leading to sinking motion and divergence in the region and resulting in reduced precipitation and warm temperatures. Thus, the co-occurrence of warm and dry anomalies has led to more frequent burning since the 2010s. Our study not only detects recent BA variations in northeastern China but also provides further evidence for the remote impact of TNA variability on recent BA and climate variations over the region."

Traffic-related emissions and biomass burning were the main sources of DTTv in the south, and traffic-related emissions contributed the most to DTTv in the north. 
 Water-soluble components significantly contribute to the oxidative potential (OP) of atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5), but our understanding of the water-soluble PM2.5 OP and its sources, as well as its relationship with water-soluble components, is still limited. In this study, the water-soluble OP levels in wintertime PM2.5 in the south and north of Beijing, representing the difference in sources, were measured with the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. The volume-normalized DTT (DTTv) in the north (3.5±1.2 nmol min−1 m−3) was comparable to that in the south (3.9±0.9 nmol min−1 m−3), while the mass-normalized DTT (DTTm) in the north (65±28 pmol min−1 µg−3) was almost twice that in the south (36±14 pmol min−1 µg−3). In both the south and north of Beijing, DTTv was better correlated with soluble elements instead of total elements. In the north, soluble elements (mainly Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, As, Cd and Pb) and water-soluble organic compounds, especially light-absorbing compounds (also known as brown carbon), had positive correlations with DTTv. However, in the south, DTTv was mainly related to soluble As, Fe and Pb. The sources of DTTv were further resolved using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. Traffic-related emissions (39 %) and biomass burning (25 %) were the main sources of DTTv in the south, and traffic-related emissions (>50 %) contributed the most to DTTv in the north. Our results indicate that vehicle emission was an important contributor to the OP in Beijing ambient PM2.5 and suggest that more study is needed to understand the intrinsic relationship between the OP and light-absorbing organic compounds."

 For nearly 30 years, the International Network to study Deposition and Atmospheric chemistry in AFrica (INDAAF) programme has measured surface ozone from 14 sites in Africa representative of the main African ecosystems: dry savannas (Banizoumbou, Niger; Katibougou and Agoufou, Mali; Bambey and Dahra, Senegal), wet savannas (Lamto, Côte d'Ivoire; Djougou, Benin), forests (Zoétélé, Cameroon; Bomassa, Republic of the Congo) and agricultural–semi-arid savannas (Mbita, Kenya; Louis Trichardt, Amersfoort, Skukuza and Cape Point, South Africa). The data are collected with passive samplers and archived as monthly averages; quality assurance is maintained by INDAAF's calibration and intercomparison protocols with other programmes employing the same systems. This analysis reports on correlations of INDAAF ozone time series (1995–2020) with local meteorological parameters and with ozone precursors, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), derived from standard global databases. Mean annual averages of surface ozone range from 3.9 ± 1.1 ppb (Bomassa) to 30.8 ± 8.0 ppb (Louis Trichardt), reflecting a general positive gradient from west central Africa to South Africa. At the decade scale, from 2000 to 2020, the Katibougou and Banizoumbou sites (dry savanna) experienced a significant decrease in ozone of around −2.4 and −0.8 ppb per decade, respectively. These decreasing trends are consistent with those observed for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and BVOCs. An increasing trend is observed in Zoétélé (2001–2020), estimated at +0.7 ppb per decade, and at Skukuza (2000–2015; +3.4 ppb per decade). The increasing trends are consistent with increasing biogenic emissions at Zoétélé and NO2 levels at Skukuza. Very few surface O3 measurements exist in Africa, and the long-term results presented in this study are the most extensive for the ecosystems studied. The importance of maintaining long-term observations like INDAAF cannot be overstated. The data can be used to assess ozone impacts on African crops. For the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report Phase II (TOAR II), they provide invaluable constraints for models of chemical and climate processes in the atmosphere."

 This work concerns analysis of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) shortly before and after sunset. Based on a large set of Doppler  lidar measurements at rural and urban sites, we analyze frequency spectra of vertical wind  at different heights and show that they increasingly deviate from Kolmogorov's -5/3 prediction in the measured low-wavenumber part of the inertial range. We find that before sunset, the integral length scales tend to decrease with time. These findings  contrast with a classical model of  equilibrium decay of isotropic turbulence, which predicts that the scaling exponent should remain constant and equal to -5/3 and the integral length scale should increase in time. We explain the observations using  recent theories of non-equilibrium turbulence. The presence of non-equilibrium  suggests that classical parametrization schemes  fail to predict turbulence statistics shortly before sunset. By comparing the classical and the non-equilibrium models, we conclude that the former may underestimate the dissipation rate of turbulence kinetic energy in the initial stages of decay."

Bednarz;Jim Haywood,How does the latitude of stratospheric aerosol injection affect the climate in UKESM1?,"Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) refers to a climate intervention by which aerosols are intentionally added to the high atmosphere to increase the amount of reflected sunlight and reduce Earth's temperature. The climate outcomes of SAI depend on the latitude of injection. While injecting aerosols at the Equator has undesirable side effects, injecting away from the Equator has different effects on temperature, rainfall, ozone, and atmospheric circulation, which are analysed in this work. 
 Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) refers to a climate intervention method by which aerosols are intentionally added to the lower stratosphere to enhance sunlight reflection and offset some of the adverse effects of global warming. The climate outcomes of SAI depend on the location, amount, and timing of injection, as well as the material used. Here, we isolate the role of the latitude of SO2 injection by comparing different scenarios that have the same global-mean temperature target, altitude of injection, and hemispherically symmetric injection rates. These are as follows: injection at the Equator (EQ) and injection at 15° N and S (15N+15S), 30° N and S (30N+30S), or 60° N and S (60N+60S). We show that injection at the Equator leads to a substantial undercooling of the Arctic, a significant reduction in tropical precipitation, reductions in high-latitude ozone, heating in the tropical lower-stratosphere, and strengthening of the stratospheric jets in both hemispheres. Additionally, we find that the most efficient injection locations are the subtropics (15 and 30° N and S), although the 60N+60S strategy only requires around 30 % more SO2 injection for the same amount of cooling; the latter also leads to much less stratospheric warming but only marginally increases high-latitude surface cooling. Finally, while all the SAI strategies come with trade-offs, our work shows that the 30N+30S strategy is a good candidate strategy for an intermodel comparison and is easier to implement than a multi-latitude controller algorithm."

OA was mainly attributed to the monoterpene oxidation products. The mixing ratios of BVOCs were higher than the values previously measured in other temperate forests. The results demonstrate that BVOCs are influenced not only by meteorology and biogenic emissions but also by local anthropogenic emissions and subsequent chemical transformation processes. 
 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are key components of the atmosphere, playing a significant role in the formation of organic aerosols (OAs). However, only a few studies have simultaneously examined the characteristics of BVOCs and OAs in forest ecosystems on the background of environmental stressors, such as consecutive droughts and extensive bark beetle infestations. Here, we present real-time measurements of OAs and BVOCs in a stressed spruce-dominated forest near a biogas power plant (BPP) in western Germany during June 2020. A proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with a particle inlet (CHARON-PTR-ToF-MS) and a Vocus-PTR-ToF-MS were used to measure OAs and BVOCs. The average OA mass concentration was 0.8 ± 0.5 µg m−3, consisting mainly of semi-volatile monoterpene oxidation products. The average mixing ratios of isoprene (0.58 ± 0.54 ppb) and monoterpenes (2.5 ± 5.3 ppb) were higher than the values previously measured in both German temperate forests and boreal forests. Based on a wind direction analysis, BVOC data were categorized into two groups: one mainly influenced by biogenic emissions from an intact forest and a clear-cut area (referred to as the biogenic group) and the other mainly influenced by anthropogenic emissions from a BPP and a village (referred to as the anthropogenic group). High mixing ratios of monoterpenes were observed in the anthropogenic group, indicating a significant contribution of BPP emissions. In the biogenic group, the variations in BVOC mixing ratios were driven by the interplay between meteorology, biogenic emissions and their photochemical consumption. Positive matrix factorization analysis of VOCs revealed substantial contributions of oxygenated organic compounds from the photochemical oxidation of BVOCs during daytime, while monoterpenes and their weakly oxidized products dominated at night. Furthermore, increasing relative humidity and decreasing temperatures promoted the gas-to-particle partitioning of these weakly oxidized monoterpene products, leading to an increase in nighttime OA mass. The results demonstrate that variations in BVOCs are influenced not only by meteorological conditions and biogenic emissions but also by local BPP emissions and subsequent chemical transformation processes. This study highlights the need to investigate the changes in biogenic emissions in stressed European forests."

A parameterization equation relating JNO3−–HONO to OC/NO3− has been established and can be used to estimate JNO3−–HONO in different environments. Our work provides an important reference for research in other regions of the world where aerosol samples have a high proportion of organic components. 
 The production mechanism of atmospheric nitrous acid (HONO), an important precursor of the hydroxyl radical (OH), remains controversial. Few studies have explored the effects of particulate nitrate photolysis on HONO sources under different environment conditions across China. In this work, the photolysis rate constant of particulate nitrate for HONO production (JNO3--HONO) was determined through a photochemical reaction system with PM2.5 samples collected from five representative sites in China. We developed a method to correct and quantify the “shadowing effect” – potential light extinction within aerosol layers under heavy PM2.5 loading conditions on the filters – for JNO3--HONO measurements, showing that elemental carbon (EC), the dominant light-absorbing component in PM2.5, plays a dominant role in it. The corrected JNO3--HONO values varied with the sampling period and location over a wide range, from 1.6 × 10−6 to 1.96 × 10−4 s−1, with a mean (±1 SD) of 1.71 (± 2.36) × 10−5 s−1. Chemical compositions, specifically those concerning nitrate loading and organic components, affected the production of HONO through particulate nitrate photolysis: high JNO3--HONO values were generally associated with PM2.5 samples with a high organic carbon (OC) / NO3- ratio (R2 = 0.86). We suggest that the parameterization equation between JNO3--HONO and the OC / NO3- ratio established in this work can be used to estimate JNO3--HONO under different aerosol chemical conditions, thus reducing the uncertainty in exploring daytime HONO sources. This study confirms that the photolysis of particulate nitrate can be a potential daytime HONO source in rural or southern urban sites, which are characterized by PM2.5 containing high proportions of organic matter."

This is well suited for satellite observations providing multi-angle polarization measurements. Cloud fraction and cloud optical thickness can be derived from measurements at two viewing angles: one within the cloudbow and one in the sun glint region. 
 We introduce a novel method to retrieve the cloud fraction and the optical thickness of liquid clouds over a water surface based on polarimetry. The approach is well suited for satellite observations providing multi-angle polarization measurements, in particular those of the Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter #2 (HARP2). Unlike commonly used methods to derive cloud fractions, our method does not depend on the spatial resolution of observations, and it does not require any threshold values for cloud detection. Based on radiative transfer simulations, we show that the cloud fraction and the cloud optical thickness can be derived from measurements at two viewing angles: one within the cloudbow and one in the sun glint region. In the cloudbow, the degree of polarization mainly depends on the cloud optical thickness. Conversely, for a viewing direction in the sun glint region, the degree of polarization depends on the clear fraction of the pixel, because here the radiation scattered by cloud droplets is almost unpolarized, whereas radiation reflected by the surface is highly polarized. Utilizing these dependencies, we developed a retrieval using a simple lookup table approach. Based on sensitivity studies, we show that prior information about wind speed and aerosol optical thickness improves the accuracy of the cloud fraction retrieval. Prior information about the cloud droplet size distribution can reduce the uncertainty of the cloud optical thickness retrieval. The prior information should be obtained by combining our method with already existing aerosol and cloud retrieval algorithms. We performed 3D radiative transfer simulations and found that the cloud optical thickness is generally underestimated due to neglect of 3D scattering effects. The cloud fraction is overestimated in cloud shadows and underestimated in in-scattering regions.As a demonstration, we apply the methodology to airborne observations from polarization cameras of the Munich Aerosol Cloud Scanner (specMACS) instrument. The high-spatial-resolution data (10–20 m) have been averaged to a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5 km to mimic satellite observations. From the average linear polarization at scattering angles of 140 and 110°, we derive continuous cloud fraction values and the corresponding cloud optical thicknesses. Comparison for cases including low, medium, and high cloud fractions shows that the retrieval, using only reflected polarized radiances at two scattering angles, provides accurate estimates of the cloud fraction for observations with coarse spatial resolution."

We developed a quality control procedure to ensure the high quality of the heterogeneous ocean oxygen data archive and to prove data consistency. Oxygen data obtained by means of oxygen sensors on autonomous Argo floats were compared with reference data based on the chemical analysis, and estimates of the residual offsets were obtained. 
 Global ocean oxygen concentrations have declined in the past decades, posing threats to marine life and human society. High-quality and bias-free observations are crucial to understanding ocean oxygen changes and assessing their impact. Here, we propose a new automated quality control (QC) procedure for ocean profile oxygen data. This procedure consists of a suite of 10 quality checks, with outlier rejection thresholds being defined based on underlying statistics of the data. The procedure is applied to three main instrumentation types: bottle casts, CTD (conductivity–temperature–depth) casts, and Argo profiling floats. Application of the quality control procedure to several manually quality-controlled datasets of good quality suggests the ability of the scheme to successfully identify outliers in the data. Collocated quality-controlled oxygen profiles obtained by means of the Winkler titration method are used as unbiased references to estimate possible residual biases in the oxygen sensor data. The residual bias is found to be negligible for electrochemical sensors typically used on CTD casts. We explain this as the consequence of adjusting to the concurrent sample Winkler data. Our analysis finds a prevailing negative residual bias with the magnitude of several µmol kg−1 for the delayed-mode quality-controlled and adjusted profiles from Argo floats varying among the data subsets adjusted by different Argo Data Assembly Centers (DACs). The respective overall DAC- and sensor-specific corrections are suggested. We also find the bias dependence on pressure, a feature common to both AANDERAA optodes and SBE43-series sensors. Applying the new QC procedure and bias adjustments resulted in a new global ocean oxygen dataset from 1920 to 2023 with consistent data quality across bottle samples, CTD casts, and Argo floats.

NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 has better computing efficiency, excels when used with a small ensemble size, and can significantly improve the simulation performance of chemical components. 
 Identifying PM2.5 chemical components is crucial for formulating emission strategies, estimating radiative forcing, and assessing human health effects. However, accurately describing spatiotemporal variations in PM2.5 chemical components remains a challenge. In our earlier work, we developed an aerosol extinction coefficient data assimilation (DA) system (Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System with the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (NAQPMS-PDAF) v1.0) that was suboptimal for chemical components. This paper introduces a novel hybrid nonlinear chemical DA system (NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0) to accurately interpret key chemical components (SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, OC, and EC). NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 improves upon v1.0 by effectively handling and balancing stability and nonlinearity in chemical DA, which is achieved by incorporating the non-Gaussian distribution ensemble perturbation and hybrid localized Kalman–nonlinear ensemble transform filter with an adaptive forgetting factor for the first time. The dependence tests demonstrate that NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 provides excellent DA results with a minimal ensemble size of 10, surpassing previous reports and v1.0. A 1-month DA experiment shows that the analysis field generated by NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 is in good agreement with observations, especially in reducing the underestimation of NH4+ and NO3- and the overestimation of SO42-, OC, and EC. In particular, the Pearson correlation coefficient (CORR) values for NO3-, OC, and EC are above 0.96, and the R2 values are above 0.93. NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 also demonstrates superior spatiotemporal interpretation, with most DA sites showing improvements of over 50 %–200 % in CORR and over 50 %–90 % in RMSE for the five chemical components. Compared to the poor performance in the global reanalysis dataset (CORR: 0.42–0.55, RMSE: 4.51–12.27 µg m−3) and NAQPMS-PDAF v1.0 (CORR: 0.35–0.98, RMSE: 2.46–15.50 µg m−3), NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 has the highest CORR of 0.86–0.99 and the lowest RMSE of 0.14–3.18 µg m−3.

We used these observations to attribute emissions to major sources, including the landfill work face, where new waste is placed at the landfill and gas-control infrastructure. Methane emissions from the work face appeared to be more prevalent than gas-control infrastructure emissions, with 52 landfills exhibiting work face emissions out of the 115 observed landfills shown to be emitting in 2023. Landfills with work face emissions were often the highest emitters, especially sites with associated renewable natural gas facilities, and the total average site emissions from these landfills accounted for 79% of the observed emissions, indicating inefficient gas capture at these sites. Landfills with work face emissions also displayed the greatest disparity between observed emission rates and hourly emission rates that we estimated using annual emissions reported to the US EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Work face emissions present a major opportunity for methane mitigation: Observed emissions from work face emitting-landfills in this study were equivalent to 15% of US methane emissions from municipal solid waste landfills in 2022, as reported in the 2024 Greenhouse Gas Inventory, though these landfills accounted for only 4% of open sites in the US. As the 217 landfills in this study cover only 17% of open landfills in the US, the total mitigation potential is likely greater.

Here, we present the first investigation of thermoelastic properties of SiO2‐seifertite under 30–200 GPa and 1,000–4,000 K using first‐principles molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the compressional and shear wave velocities of seifertite are 2.0%–4.3% and 7.4%–11.3% lower, respectively, than those of CaCl2‐type SiO2 in the D'' layer. The reductions in VS across the phase transition are significantly larger than previous estimates from density functional theory results. Incorporating the elastic properties of other minerals, we demonstrate that the presence of SiO2 in the accumulated subducted oceanic crust and the associated VS reductions can contribute to the negative velocity discontinuities observed in the D'' layer.

Powerful canyon‐flushing turbidity currents break sensors placed in their path, making them notoriously challenging to measure, and thus poorly understood. This study provides the first remote measurements of canyon‐flushing flows, using ocean‐bottom seismographs located outside the flow's destructive path, revolutionizing flow monitoring. We recorded the internal dynamics of the longest sediment flows yet monitored on Earth, which traveled >1,000 km down the Congo Canyon‐Channel at 3.7–7.6 m s−1 and lasted >3 weeks. These observations allow us to test fundamental models for turbidity current behavior and reveal that flows contain dense and fast frontal‐zones up to ∼400 km in length. These frontal‐zones developed near‐uniform durations and speeds for hundreds of kilometres despite substantial seabed erosion, enabling flows to rapidly transport prodigious volumes of organic carbon, sediment, and warm water to the deep‐sea."

The low‐wavenumber ends of the −5/3 scaling law regions in the spanwise and vertical velocity spectra correlate better with a shear‐related length scale. Based on the characteristics of velocity spectra and the balance between kinetic energy and potential energy, a new length scale is proposed to indicate Lmt ${L}_{mt}$ for moderately stable conditions.

Turbulent mixing is characterized by tidal excursion parameter (Te) and topographic steepness parameter (Sp) measuring tidal current strength and seafloor slope gradient, respectively. Under strong tidal currents (Te > 1), high‐wavenumber internal lee waves propagate upward from the seafloor. Even when Te and Sp are set to produce nearly the same upward energy flux, the vertical profile of mixing hotspots varies with Sp. For Sp ≳ $\mathit{\gtrsim }$ 0.2, near‐inertial currents above the seafloor rapidly amplify by absorbing energy of internal lee waves from below, hindering their upward propagation and creating “short mixing hotspots.” For Sp < 0.2, these near‐inertial currents diminish, allowing internal lee waves to propagate upward and interact with the GM background internal waves, creating “tall mixing hotspots.”"

However, available forcing data sets remain highly uncertain and can introduce additional differences in LSM simulations. This study explored the impact of various forcing data sets, ranging from widely used to newly developed, on hydrological simulations using the Common Land Model 2024 (CoLM2024). We conducted 12 global experiments using different forcing data sets to force CoLM2024. We evaluated the model's performance against plot‐scale observations and globally gridded reference data. We examined the uncertainties in forcings and their impact on output variables such as latent heat, sensible heat, net radiation, and total runoff. Globally, precipitation has the highest degree of uncertainty at 4.4%. The forcing uncertainties propagate to the model simulations and cause significant differences in simulated variables. Runoff uncertainty is about 15.7% globally, with a greater impact in low latitudes. Our evaluation shows that the newly developed data sets, such as CRUJRA and ERA5LAND, generally outperform the others. However, the optimal forcing data set varies depending on the variable of interest and the targeted region. Partial Least Squares Regression analysis reveals that different simulated variables are associated with dominant forcing variables, highlighting the importance of selecting forcing data sets for specific applications and regions. This study confirms the importance of improving the quality and consistency of meteorological data. This would help reduce simulation biases and guide the improvement of the model structure and parameterization of CoLM2024."

Moreover, high proportions of secondary inorganic aerosols sources (SNA) were identified by PMF without corresponding primary sources. This study develops a new method that combines multi‐isotopes (34S, 15N, 18O and 14C) and PMF model to optimize source apportionment. Data sets A–F, constructed from PM2.5 components, were input into PMF model to obtain optimal results (3–9 factors), which changed with the selection of species. Specifically, the contributions of coal combustion (CC, 3%–36%), biomass burning (BB, 11%–38%), and vehicle sources (VS, 4%–15%) showed significant differences in data sets, indicating that conventional methods cannot obtain accurate results. Then, 15N, 34S, 18O were introduced to restrict and reallocate identified SNA sources to primary sources, overcoming the influence of species on results. Additionally, 14C was used to evaluate data sets results, which showed that the combination of PMF model with more markers (data set F, 9‐factor) and multi‐isotopes techniques obtained optimized results that aligned with 14C results. Compared with the initial results, the contributions of CC, VS, and BB in the allocated 9‐factor increased by 26.4%, 5%, and 19.5%, respectively, becoming main sources of PM2.5. This study represents the first time that combination of PMF model and multi‐isotopes achieves SNA sources reapportionment and results evaluation, improving source apportionment methods."

Kilometer‐scale convection‐permitting climate models (CPMs) represent convective precipitation and complex terrain more realistically than other climate models, thereby enhancing the representation of sub‐daily extremes. This study employs a novel statistical approach to evaluate projected changes in extreme sub‐daily precipitation and provides a physical interpretation of their driving processes. It focuses on the complex‐topography area of northern Italy, where resides almost half of the Italian population and a significant portion of the Italian economy, with a rich diversity in industry, agriculture, tourism. We use precipitation data from a CPMs ensemble covering three periods: historical (1996–2005), near future (2041–2050), far future (2090–2099) under the RCP8.5 scenario. Sub‐daily to daily precipitation extremes with return periods up to 100 years are examined. We find a general intensification of extremes across all durations (from 1 to 24 hr), stronger at shorter durations and rarer probabilities. Spatial patterns vary with duration, with higher and significant increases emerging in mountainous areas in Eastern Alps and North Apennines. The detected changes cannot be explained by thermodynamics alone, highlighting the modulating role of the changes in atmospheric dynamics. These findings are crucial for enhancing risk management strategies and adapting to natural hazards in a warming climate. This approach may be exploited in larger scale analysis."

However, this view fails to explain the observation of the low free‐living BNF rates in these sites. Here, we conducted two field experiments and a global synthesis to assess the regulatory patterns of free‐living BNF at both regional and global scales. The field experiments showed that the regional distributions of litter free‐living BNF did not necessarily peak at warm and wet sites, due to co‐regulation by climate and substrate stoichiometry (especially carbon:(nitrogen:phosphorus)). Subsequently, the global synthesis demonstrated that these phenomena and co‐regulatory patterns persisted in free‐living BNF in litter and other substrates (e.g., soil) at global scale.

 The dynamic alteration of the tumor microenvironment (TME) serves as a driving force behind the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Within the intricate TME, a pivotal player is the extracellular matrix (ECM), where modifications in components, degradation, and stiffness are considered critical factors in tumor development. In this study, we find that the membrane glycoprotein dysadherin directly targets matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), initiating ECM remodeling within the TME and amplifying cancer progression. Mechanistically, the dysadherin/MMP9 axis not only enhances CRC cell invasiveness and ECM proteolytic activity but also activates cancer-associated fibroblasts, orchestrating the restructuring of the ECM through the synthesis of its components in human CRC cells, patient samples, and mouse models. Notably, disruption of ECM reorganization by dysadherin knockout results in a discernible reduction in the immunosuppressive and proangiogenic milieu in a humanized mouse model. Intriguingly, these effects are reversed upon the overexpression of MMP9, highlighting the intricate and pivotal role of the dysadherin/MMP9 axis in shaping the development of a malignant TME. Therefore, our findings not only highlight that dysadherin contributes to CRC progression by influencing the TME through ECM remodeling but also suggest that dysadherin may be a potential therapeutic target for CRC.

 Transcranial brain stimulation is a promising technology for safe modulation of brain function without invasive procedures. Recent advances in transcranial optogenetic techniques with external light sources, using upconversion particles and highly sensitive opsins, have shown promise for precise neuromodulation with improved spatial resolution in deeper brain regions. However, these methods have not yet been used to selectively excite or inhibit specific neural populations in multiple brain regions.

We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in freely behaving mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate its usefulness in studies of complex behaviors and brain dysfunction by controlling extorting behavior in mice in food competition tests and alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

 Satellite earth observation (EO) data plays a vital role quantifying vegetation structural and functional metrics across spatio-temporal scales. However, the degree of coupling between satellite derived spectral signals and the rate of photosynthesis, as estimated by Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), both before and after bushfire remain understudied, yet these are a critical part of the global carbon cycle. This study evaluated a combination of passive optical and active LiDAR satellite data to quantify the disturbance and recovery of photosynthesis from a major fire event. The work was completed at the Tumbarumba long-term tall eucalypt flux site following a catastrophic bushfire in December 2019. TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and Sentinel 2 derived greenness and burn severity metrics (NDVI, EVI, NIRv, and NBR) were investigated, termed ‘spectral metrics’ herewith. Detailed in-situ observations from leaf-to-canopy scales were utilised to examine variations in vegetation structural-functional parameters.We found the rate of vegetation spectral metrics recovery largely outpaced GPP recovery at the one- and two-year post-fire mark. Specifically, SIF recovered to 80–90 % compared to pre-fire levels, whereas GPP recovered only 45–50 %. This indicated that separate SIF:GPP functions were required for pre- and post-fire data to account for different recovery trajectories due to changes in canopy structure and species composition. The use of TROPOMI SIF for monitoring canopy productivity at seasonal (monthly) time-scales was advantageous over traditional greenness-based indices, as SIF tracked GPP seasonality both pre- and post-fire. Spaceborne GEDI LiDAR data effectively captured post-fire changes in forest structure, albeit at sparse spatio-temporal sampling intervals, revealing a significant reduction in overstorey vegetation density and a concurrent increase in understorey vegetation density. This contributed to reduced carbon uptake, compared to pre-fire, due to the lower light use efficiency of understorey species, which was verified with in-situ gas exchange measurements. Overall, this study highlights the importance of accounting for disturbance history and the relative abundance of overstorey and understorey vegetation for tracking GPP from satellite platforms. Our results also highlight the crucial role of longitudinal field-based data for calibration and validation of EO data, ultimately enhancing our understanding of forest recovery processes."

 Using remote sensing to measure suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in mountainous rivers can compensate for the scarcity of in situ sediment observations, providing valuable direct supplementation to observational records. However, for inland rivers, remote sensing SSC assessments face challenges such as data quality, long-term water body changes, environmental noise, flood events, and the transferability of local calibrations. Here, we introduce and apply remote sensing big data techniques using 12,445 cloud-free Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images to calibrate SSC in the source region of the Yangtze River (SRYR). Utilizing Google Earth Engine, we implemented a series of image preprocessing techniques and water fraction methods to extract precise inland river water masks. Then we used unsupervised K-Means clustering and machine learning algorithms to model the relationship between water optical properties and SSC. By integrating these methodologies, we achieved an average relative calibration error of 0.26 for each optical cluster, and an average relative station deviation of 0.24 based on in situ measurements, minimizing SSC calibration to acceptable levels. Additionally, our results reveal that geomorphic patterns significantly influence sediment yield and transport by regulating sediment sources and sinks, fluvial morphology, and water-sediment connectivity. Over the past two decades, approximately 35.73 % of the sediment relative to the basin outlet discharge in the SRYR has been temporarily stored or confined within sediment sinks.

 Surface soil moisture (SM) plays an important role in water and energy cycles. Passive microwave remote sensing observation has become the main means of obtaining large-scale surface SM. Due to its low spatial resolution, the spatial downscaling is required. With the development of artificial intelligence, data-driven SM downscaling models have emerged in recent years and have shown better accuracy than traditional physical models. However, data-driven SM downscaling models still have problems such as poor interpretability and easy overfitting. Therefore, this paper proposes a new SM downscaling model based on physical rule-constrained deep learning, named Physics-informed Soil Moisture Downscaling Deep Neural Network (PhySoilNet). This model adds the physical relationship between SM and the downscaling factor Land surface Evaporative Efficiency, as well as the saturated and residual boundary of SM into the Loss function of deep learning, thereby constraining the neural network. Results showed that PhySoilNet successfully downscaled the 9 km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM to 500 m, and performed well in the evaluations with in-situ, aerial, and SMAP SM. Compared to the downscaling model of only data-driven, the PhySoilNet had better performance in all evaluations, and the metrics in the in-situ SM network evaluation were improved by 20 % for R, 9.9 % for ubRMSE, 7.2 % for MAE, and 7.2 % for RMSE. At the same time, the number of SM predicted by PhySoilNet that outside the reasonable SM boundary range was significantly reduced. This fully demonstrates that data-driven based on physical rule constraints can achieve SM downscaling more effectively. Coupling physical rules and deep learning can fully utilize the powerful fitting ability of data-driven methods while improving the generalization ability and interpretability of downscaling models through prior physical knowledge."

 Inland freshwaters are essential in maintaining ecological balance and supporting human development. However, comprehensive water data cataloguing remains insufficient, especially for small water bodies (i.e., ponds), which are overlooked despite their ecological importance. To address this gap, remote sensing has emerged as a possible solution for understanding ecohydrological characteristics of water bodies, particularly in water-stressed areas. Here, we propose a novel framework based on a Sentinel-1&2 local surface water (SLSW) model targeting very small (<0.5 ha, Mdn ≈ 0.031 ha) and seasonal water bodies. We tested this framework in three semiarid regions in SW Iberia, subjected to distinct seasonality and bioclimatic changes. Surface water attributes, including surface water occurrence and extent, were modelled using a Random Forests classifier, and SLSW time series forecasts were generated from 2020 to 2021. Model reliability was first verified through comparative data completeness analyses with the established Landsat-based global surface water (LGSW) model, considering both intra-annual and inter-annual variations. Further, the performance of the SLSW and LGSW models was compared by examining their correlations for specific periods (dry and wet seasons) and against a validation dataset. The SLSW model demonstrated satisfactory results in detecting surface water occurrence (μ ≈ 72 %), and provided far greater completeness and reconstructed seasonality patterns than the LGSW model. Additionally, SLSW model exhibited a stronger correlation with LGSW during wet seasons (R2 = 0.38) than dry seasons (R2 = 0.05), and aligned more closely with the validation dataset (R2 = 0.66) compared to the LGSW model (R2 = 0.24). These findings underscore the SLSW model’s potential to effectively capture surface characteristics of very small and seasonal water bodies, which are challenging to map over broad regions and often beyond the capabilities of conventional global products. Also, given the vulnerability of water resources in semiarid regions to climate fluctuations, the present framework offers advantages for the local reconstruction of continuous, high-resolution time series, useful for identifying surface water trends and anomalies. This information has the potential to better guide regional water management and policy in support of Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on ecosystem resilience and water sustainability."

 The phenological characteristics of vegetation exposed to oil pollution can reveal how different vegetation types and species respond to the effects of hydrocarbons in crude oil. This can further inform the recovery status and remediation efforts on polluted sites. In this study, the potential of various SAR frequencies (including multitemporal C band Sentinel-1, X band Cosmo Skymed, X band TanDEM-X, and L band ALOS PALSAR 2) were explored to analyse the characteristics of vegetation affected by hydrocarbons over time. The SAR backscatter characteristics of both oil-polluted and oil-free vegetation were systematically examined across different seasons to deduce the primary effects of oil pollution. Additionally, machine learning random forest (RF) classification and support vector machines (SVM) were implemented on seasonal image composites to assess spatial extent. Results show that stress caused by oil pollution on vegetation is better distinguishable during the wet season in the VV channel than in the VH channel of the multitemporal Sentinel 1. This was supported by the machine learning classification, as overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa (K) were also highest with the wet season SAR image composites.

 This study aimed to create a model to identify land suitable for growing sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) in the Okavango River basin of the Kavango East region of Namibia. Advanced tree-based ensemble learning models, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost and multivariate regression analysis , were employed to enhance analytical accuracy. The Random Forest and XGboost models exhibited outstanding performance, as evidenced by their respective accuracy values of 0.97 and 0.96. In addition, this study proposed an innovative approach through the integration of subjective and objective analytical methods, which are independent of one another. The subjective component of the analysis employed a Multi-Criteria Decision Making-Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP). On the other hand, the objective component used a data-driven multivariate approach supported by tree-based learning algorithms. Twenty-two variables were considered, encompassing climatic conditions, hydro-geomorphologic features, soil characteristics, vegetation patterns, and socio-economic factors. These variables played a crucial role to identify the most suitable areas for growing the selected leguminous crops. The MCDM-AHP method utilised expert evaluations to rank the importance of variables, identifying water sources, slope, and soil properties as key factors. A suitability mapping analysis revealed that 17.63% of the area was highly suitable and 62.77% moderately suitable, while 10% was less suitable and 9.59% unsuitable for growing these two legumes.

 The perception of safety significantly impacts residents’ urban living and socio-economic development. However, the phenomenon and drivers of gender differences in safety perceptions have not received sufficient emphasis, resulting in the gradual exacerbation of gender inequality in urban environments. To address this issue, we explored a research methodology that integrates visual perception with socio-environmental characteristics to more comprehensively explain gender differences in safety perceptions. We conducted an empirical investigation in the primary urban area of Nanjing, China. We explored the spatial distribution characteristics of safety perception differences using the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model and spatial autocorrelation analysis. Additionally, we examined the impact of visual elements on gender differences through ridge regression analysis. Given the unsteady spatial distribution of urban environmental data and safety perceptions, we employed multi-scale geographically weighted regression models to account for differential distributions. These models captured the spatial relationships between indicators of socio-economic characteristics, urban environmental characteristics, social media vitality, and safety perceptions. Some interesting findings were identified in the study: (1) Gender differences were concentrated in high-density old urban areas and expansive agricultural land.

 Understanding the characteristics of the growth zones of live corals and competitive algae, including turf algae and macroalgae, is crucial for assessing the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. However, identifying live corals and competitive algae in multispectral satellite images is challenging because different objects can have similar spectra. To address this, we used two satellite images acquired at different times (Landsat thematic mapper (TM), Landsat operational land imager (OLI), or Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI)) to assess the growth zone characteristics of live corals and competitive algae. This assessment leveraged the seasonal dieback of competitive algae and the relative stability of live-coral growth zones over a short period. Specifically, we developed a normalized red–green difference index (NRGI) to segment live-coral-or-competitive-alga growth zones in satellite images. By comparing the segmentation results from an image captured during a period with few competitive algae and another image captured during a period with lush competitive algae, we estimated the growth zone areas of the live corals and competitive algae. Finally, we calculated the ratio of the competitive-alga growth zone area to the live-coral growth zone area (RCL). Experiments on eight typical coral islands and reefs in the South China Sea (SCS) from 1995 to 2022 revealed that: (1) the identification accuracies of live-coral-or-competitive-alga growth zones reached 80.3 % and 92.6 % during periods with few competitive algae (January to March) and lush competitive algae (April to October), respectively; (2) the RCL was well correlated with the coral-macroalgae encounter rate (an ecological index indicating the pressure of the competitive algae on the live corals) (r = 0.79, P<0.05); and (3) the trends in the growth zones of competitive algae and live corals, along with the RCL, were consistent with major ecological events in the SCS, such as coral bleaching, outbreak of Acanthaster planci, and black band disease. (4) Moreover, a time-lagged correlation was observed between heat stress and the RCL. In summary, the proposed approach is simple, effective, and feasible. The RCL is a valuable indicator of the status of coral reef ecosystems, highlighting the pressure of competitive algae on live corals and the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. This method introduces a novel application of multispectral satellite images for assessing coral reef ecosystems and has significant potential for future coral reef ecosystem monitoring."

 Monitoring the distribution and size of long-living large shrubs, such as junipers, is crucial for assessing the long-term impacts of global change on high-mountain ecosystems. While deep learning models have shown remarkable success in object segmentation, adapting these models to detect shrub species with polymorphic nature remains challenging. In this research, we release a large dataset of individual shrub delineations on freely available satellite imagery and use an instance segmentation model to map all junipers over the treeline for an entire biosphere reserve (Sierra Nevada, Spain). To optimize performance, we introduced a novel dual data construction approach: using photo-interpreted (PI) data for model development and fieldwork (FW) data for validation. To account for the polymorphic nature of junipers during model evaluation, we developed a soft version of the Intersection over Union metric. Finally, we assessed the uncertainty of the resulting map in terms of canopy cover and density of shrubs per size class. Our model achieved an F1-score in shrub delineation of 87.87% on the PI data and 76.86% on the FW data. The R2 and RMSE of the observed versus predicted relationship were 0.63 and 6.67% for canopy cover, and 0.90 and 20.62 for shrub density. The greater density of larger shrubs in lower altitudes and smaller shrubs in higher altitudes observed in the model outputs was also present in the PI and FW data, suggesting an altitudinal uplift in the optimal performance of the species. This study demonstrates that deep learning applied on freely available high-resolution satellite imagery is useful to detect medium to large shrubs of high ecological value at the regional scale, which could be expanded to other high-mountains worldwide and to historical and fothcoming imagery."

 There is a need to help farmers make decisions to maximize crop yields. Many studies have emerged in recent years using deep learning on remotely sensed images to detect plant diseases, which can be caused by multiple factors such as environmental conditions, genetics or pathogens. This problem can be considered as an anomaly detection task. However, these approaches are often limited by the availability of annotated data or prior knowledge of the existence of an anomaly. In many cases, it is not possible to obtain this information. In this work, we propose an approach that can detect plant anomalies without prior knowledge of their existence, thus overcoming these limitations. To this end, we train a model on an auxiliary prediction task using a dataset composed of samples of normal and abnormal plants. Our proposed method studies the distribution of heatmaps retrieved from an explainability model. Based on the assumptions that the model trained on the auxiliary task is able to extract important plant characteristics, we propose to study how closely the heatmap of a new observation follows the heatmap distribution of a normal dataset. Through the proposed a contrario approach, we derive a score indicating potential anomalies.Experiments show that our approach outperforms reference approaches such as f-AnoGAN and OCSVM on the GrowliFlower and PlantDoc datasets and has competitive performances on the PlantVillage dataset, while not requiring the prior knowledge on the existence of anomalies."

 Rice, a crucial global food crop, necessitates accurate mapping for food security assessment.

The Hongzehu (HZH) area in Jiangsu contributes substantially to rice supply, supporting food security locally and province-wide. Sentinel-1 SAR data, particularly Single Look Complex (SLC) products, holds promise for precise crop mapping with enhanced phase and polarization information, enhancing sensitivity to rice growth changes by analyzing rice surface features information. However, challenges persist, especially climate impacts and timing inconsistencies between fields for planting rice. To overcome this, our study proposes a progressive feature screening and fusion method using multi-temporal SAR images. We introduce fuzzy coarse screening based on statistical distribution characteristics and refine it with Gaussian fitting. A model incorporating time-series sample separation and polarization decomposition feature fusion based on rice growth height enhances rice growth expression. For more precise results, we advocate a multi-temporal feature fusion approach using optimized sample features in the BiLSTM network to characterize rice growth and ground features. Experimental results demonstrate the method’s efficacy in two cities with a limited number of sampling points. The progressive feature fusion (DF) method outperforms classical classification methods using single feature (SF) or combined features (CF). Our proposed strategy proves effective for rice mapping applications, providing a promising approach for leveraging Sentinel-1 SLC SAR data.

Results indicate that the choice of relative humidity (RH) threshold for filtering precipitating parcels has a noticeable impact on the Lagrangian precipitation estimates. In addition, methods applying the atmospheric boundary layer restriction produce a weaker moisture source pattern than those accounting for moisture uptakes in the whole atmospheric column. In particular, methods imposing an RH restriction along the air parcel trajectories to filter out noise in moisture losses outperform the others, providing more reliable moisture source contributions.

 A downburst is a localized and intense downdraft of air that descends quickly from the middle troposphere and reaches the Earth's surface. It is frequently originated by a thunderstorm or a supercell. Downburst winds can cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and pose a great threat to aviation traffic. On July 1, 2018, many supercells were spotted near the Zaragoza Airport (Spain), and at least one of them generated a downburst that affected the airport, causing significant damage in the surrounding area. This event is here simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) numerical weather prediction model. Three different WRF-ARW orography experiments are carried out to investigate if the region's complex orography has an important role in supercell and downburst development over the research area. One of the three experiments uses the default orography as control; another one uses a 90 % smoothed orography, and the third experiment is configured with a high-resolution dataset. Several atmospheric and convective variables are compared for each orography experiment. Results show that MUCAPE is clearly higher when the orography complexity is reduced. The smoothing process leads to a more uniform wind flow, contributing to the formation of numerous supercells. However, supercells channel through valleys and mountains in the control and high-resolution orography experiments, where the surface wind divergences are uniquely reproduced, and the highest reflectivity values are observed. Moisture advection from the Mediterranean Sea is essential in the process, reaching more deeply into the study region in the smoothed orography experiment due to the lack of orographic barriers.

 Regional variations in atmospheric moisture residence time (RT) highlight the need to obtain independent observation indexes to constrain different model-based estimates. Stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen naturally exist in water molecules that can provide such observational constraints. We analyzed the relationship between RT and precipitation isotopes (δ2H and δ18O) across different climatic zones in Eurasia from 1980 to 2020. Our analysis reveals that: (1) Both precipitation isotopes and RT showed significant increasing trends during 1980–2020. The increase in RT corresponds to weakened net isotopic distillation over Eurasia, suggesting reduced atmospheric circulation intensity under warming conditions. (2) The spatial patterns of RT and precipitation isotopes vary significantly among different moisture source regions, reflecting distinct moisture transport and precipitation formation processes. (3) On long-term scales, RT generally shows positive correlations with precipitation isotopes, except in plateau regions.

 Characterizing and understanding the evolving water cycle in the Three-River Headwaters (TRH) region of the Tibetan Plateau, where data scarcity poses significant challenges to climate and atmospheric water cycle research, heavily depends on model simulations. However, advanced global climate models and reanalysis datasets frequently overestimate precipitation. To address this, we employ high-resolution (9 km) regional climate simulations (WRF9km) to examine atmospheric water cycle variables in the TRH region, comparing them with in-situ observations and ERA5 reanalysis. Our study demonstrates that WRF9km substantially reduces the overestimation of summer precipitation (by 24.0 %) and evapotranspiration (by 52.7 %) compared to ERA5, thereby improving its alignment with observational data. The reduced biases in precipitation are attributed to diminished moisture influx from the southern boundary and local evapotranspiration, coupled with increased moisture export from the eastern boundary. Summer precipitation recycling (PR) accounts for approximately 20 % of total precipitation in the TRH region. Despite divergent trends in PR between a water accounting model (WAM) and a bulk method, our findings support the reliability of WAM, indicating a slight decrease in summer PR (−0.4 %/10a for ERA5 and − 0.6 %/10a for WRF9km). While WRF9km accurately captures the spatial pattern of summer PR, ERA5 appears to overestimate it, likely due to biases in evapotranspiration and moisture inflow. In conclusion, WRF9km provides a more accurate representation of the atmospheric water cycle in the TRH region."

This biomass fibrous framework (Ct-Cel) showcases an excellent adsorption performance for polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate.

Here, we show in male and female mice that enhancing levels of the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), through pharmacological inhibition of its catabolic enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), either systemically or in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) with JZL184, leads to a substantial attenuation of the rewarding effects of opioids in mice using conditioned place preference and self-administration paradigms, without altering their analgesic properties. These effects are driven by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) within the VTA, as VTA CB1R conditional knockout counteracts JZL184’s effects. Using fiber photometry with fluorescent sensors for calcium and dopamine (DA), we find that enhancing 2-AG levels diminishes opioid reward–related nucleus accumbens (NAc) activity and DA neurotransmission.

Biochemical data indicate that FER phosphorylates CC1 on multiple residues in its second and third hydrophobic microtubule-binding regions and that these phosphorylations modulate CC1 trafficking and affect the ability of CC1 to engage with microtubules. Furthermore, CC1 phosphorylation level is altered upon exposure to salt stress, which coincides with the changes of microtubule organization.

Dense laths composed of the multiscaled LCO domains evolve from planar-slip bands that form in the prior thermomechanical processing, contributing to ultrahigh yield strengths over a wide temperature range. During cryogenic tensile deformation, LCO further develops and promotes remarkable dislocation cross-slip.

A key effector of these changes is exaggerated airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell contraction to spasmogens. No drugs in clinical use effectively prevent ASM hyperresponsiveness in asthma across all severities. We find that N-cadherin, a membrane cell-cell adhesion protein up-regulated in ASM from patients with severe asthma, is required for the development of airway obstruction induced by allergic airway inflammation in mice. Inhibition of N-cadherin by ADH-1 reduced airway hyperresponsiveness independent of allergic inflammation, prevented bronchoconstriction, and actively promoted bronchodilation of airways ex vivo. ADH-1 inhibited ASM contraction by disrupting N-cadherin–δ-catenin interactions, which decreased intracellular actin remodeling.

When one end of an actively reptative polymer is anchored, it undergoes continual self-knotting as a result of intermittent giant conformation fluctuations and the outward reptative motion. Once a knot is formed, it migrates to the anchoring point due to a nonequilibrium ratchet effect. Moreover, when the active polymer is grafted on a passive polymer, it can function as a self-propelling soft needle to either transfer its own knots or directly braid knots on the passive polymer.

For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to be essential in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz, is challenging because of limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO3and SrTiO3by surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO3, the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 terahertz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO3broadens substantially below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub–milli–electron volt phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition.

Steven,Climate refugia in the Great Barrier Reef may endure into the future,"Although global warming is leading to more frequent mass coral bleaching events worldwide, parts of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) have consistently escaped severe coral bleaching. Modeling and satellite observations show that climate refugia are created by the upwelling of cooler water to the surface through the interactions of tides and currents with dense reef structures. Here, we use a high-resolution nested regional ocean model to investigate the future status of two relatively large refugia. On the basis of model projections under a high-emission scenario, we find that the upwelling mechanisms will stay active in a warming climate, and these regions are likely to remain approximately more than 1°C cooler than surrounding waters until at least into the 2080s, providing thermal relief to corals. Identification and protection of these refugia may help facilitate reef survival and related biodiversity preservation by allowing their corals time to acclimatize and adapt and ultimately provide source populations to replenish the rest of the reef."

An example is the carboxysome, a bacterial microcompartment for CO2fixation. The carboxysome uses a polyhedral protein shell made of hexamers, pentamers, and trimers to encapsulate Rubisco, increasing CO2levels near Rubisco to enhance carboxylation. Despite their role in the global carbon cycle, the molecular mechanisms behind carboxysome shell assembly remain unclear. Here, we present a structural characterization of α-carboxysome shells generated from recombinant systems, which contain all shell proteins and the scaffolding protein CsoS2. Atomic-resolution cryo–electron microscopy of the shell assemblies, with a maximal size of 54 nm, unveil diverse assembly interfaces between shell proteins, detailed interactions of CsoS2 with shell proteins to drive shell assembly, and the formation of heterohexamers and heteropentamers by different shell protein paralogs, facilitating the assembly of larger empty shells. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the construction principles of α-carboxysome shells and the role of CsoS2 in governing α-carboxysome assembly and functionality."

To reverse this situation, we synthesized inhalable PFCE-C25 nanoemulsions (NEs), which target lymphocyte activation genes (LAG-3) on immune cells within tumor microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). By combining in vivo19F-MR molecular imaging, we investigate the immunological effects of a single low-dose PFCE-C25 NEs in multiple murine lung cancer models, including human immune system (HIS) mouse models, and validated its immunological effects in human TDLNs. The nebulization therapy with PFCE-C25 NEs demonstrated a notable and enduring maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in TDLNs, leading to systemic immune responses, prolonged survival, the establishment of immune memory, and resistance to tumor rechallenge. Thus, PFCE-C25 NEs successfully demonstrate a promising and efficient approach for enhancing lymphatic transport and sustained activation of antitumor immune responses in lung cancer."

Our study investigated the association between PM2.5exposure and immune response, as well as epigenetic changes using high-dimensional epigenetic landscape profiling using cytometry by time-of-flight (EpiTOF) at the single cell. We found statistically significant associations between PM2.5exposure and levels of certain cytokines [interleukin-1RA (IL-1RA), IL-8/CXCL8, IL-18, and IL-27)] and histone posttranslational modifications (HPTMs) in immune cells (HPTMs: H3K9ac, H3K23ac, H3K27ac, H2BK120ub, H4K20me1/3, and H3K9me1/2) among pregnant and nonpregnant women. The cord blood of neonates with high maternal PM2.5exposure showed lower IL-27 than those with low exposure. Furthermore, PM2.5exposure affects the co-modification profiles of cytokines between pregnant women and their neonates, along with HPTMs in each immune cell type between pregnant and nonpregnant women. These modifications in specific histones and cytokines could indicate the toxicological mechanism of PM2.5exposure in inflammation, inflammasome pathway, and pregnancy complications."

Marshall,High temperatures are associated with decreased immune system performance in a wild primate,"Rising temperatures due to climate change are predicted to threaten the persistence of wild animals, but there is little evidence that climate change has pushed species beyond their thermal tolerance. The immune system is an ideal avenue to assess the effects of climate change because immune performance is sensitive to changes in temperature and immune competency can affect reproductive success. We investigate the effect of rising temperatures on a biomarker of nonspecific immune performance in a wild population of capuchin monkeys and provide compelling evidence that immune performance is associated with ambient temperature. Critically, we found that immune performance in young individuals is more sensitive to high temperatures compared to other age groups. Coupled with evidence of rising temperatures in the region, our results offer insight into how climate change will affect the immune system of wild mammals."
