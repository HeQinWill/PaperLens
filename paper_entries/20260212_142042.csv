Turnock;Yixiong Lu;Tongwen Wu;Fang Zhang;Xiaoge Xin;Yuyun Liu,Unveiling the dominant control of the systematic  cooling bias in CMIP6 models: quantification  and corrective strategies,"Aerosol cooling has been identified as a key driver of the cold biases in CMIP6 (sixth Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project) models. We demonstrate the critical role of sulfate burden anomaly and the contribution of sulfur removal processes. Faster sulfate deposition directly lowers atmospheric sulfate levels, while enhanced SO₂ deposition reduces the precursor for sulfate formation. The systematically short sulfate lifetime implies that model improvements should focus on SO₂ deposition processes, rather than sulfate deposition. 
 Including sophisticated aerosol schemes in the models of the sixth Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6) has not improved historical climate simulations. In particular, the models underestimate the surface air temperature anomaly (SATa) when anthropogenic sulfur emissions increased in 1960–1990, making the reliability of the CMIP6 projections questionable. This cooling bias is largely attributable to the unreasonable simulated atmospheric sulfate burden changes. Sulfate burden anomaly are closely linked to both sulfate and SO2 deposition processes. Intensified sulfate deposition directly reduces atmospheric sulfate loading, while enhanced SO2 deposition limits precursor availability for sulfate formation by oxidation. These deposition processes regulate sulfate concentrations directly and indirectly. The systematically underestimated sulfate turnover time in CMIP6 models suggests that refining SO2 deposition process rather than sulfate deposition would be a more scientific approach for model improvement. This is supported by two post-CMIP6 models that show better SATa reproduction after improving the SO2 deposition parameterizations. Strong correlations between sulfate burden anomaly and SATa persist before, during, and after the 1960–1990 period. Such temporal consistency confirms the dominant role of sulfate-related physical processes across all examined time intervals."

These equations are used to transfer calibrations from our standards calibrated at the World Radiation Center in Davos, Switzerland, to our field PIR pyrgeometers. A clear choice in terms of the most precise method to follow emerges from this study. Further, we evaluate the stability of the Eppley PIR, necessary for long-term trend analysis. 
 The Eppley Precision Infrared Radiometer (PIR) is widely used for broadband (3.5–50 µm), thermal infrared wavelength measurements of the downwelling and upwelling radiation from the atmosphere and surface, respectively. The field of view of the instrument is 2π steradians with a receiver that has an approximate cosine response. In this paper we examine four equations suggested by the literature that have been used to transfer irradiance calibrations from our standard PIRs that are calibrated at the World Radiation Center to field units used for network operations. We first discuss various equations used to convert the resistance measurements of the thermistors to temperatures of the body and dome that are used in the derivation of incoming irradiance. We then use the four related, but distinct, equations for the transfer of the calibration from standard PIRs to field instruments. A clear choice for the preferred equation to use for calibration and transfer of calibration to field PIRs emerges from this study."

A variety of different sensors measure precipitation, water vapor content, humidity, temperature, and cloud properties in high spatial and temporal resolution. This enables detailed analyses of weather phenomena in a changing climate, such as heavy rainfall events and thunderstorms. 
 This paper describes the first release of Level 1b and Level 2 high-resolution atmospheric data cubes generated in the WegenerNet 3D Open-Air Laboratory for Climate Change Research Feldbach Region (WEGN3D Open-Air Lab). These datasets, based on the continuous WegenerNet 3D observations form a growing multi-year observational data collection at sub-kilometer scale and sub-hourly resolution. They are capable to support the study of weather extremes in a changing climate, water vapor–cloud–precipitation interactions, and interactions between the surface and the free atmosphere, among other uses.The data are not assimilated into reanalyses or numerical weather prediction models. Consequently, they can also serve as an independent dataset for evaluation and validation of such models, as well as of climate-oriented modeling, at high spatial and temporal resolution. The instrumentation behind the WEGN3D Open-Air Lab atmospheric data cubes consists of an X-band dual-polarization precipitation radar, a combined microwave/infrared tropospheric sounding radiometer, an infrared cloud structure radiometer, and a six-station water vapor sounding Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) network with baselines of 5 to 10 km. These sensors form the WegenerNet 3D Observing System and complement the existing WegenerNet climate station network in the Feldbach region. The site is situated in the Alpine forelands of southeastern Austria and covers an area of approximately 1400 km2, with radar volume scans reaching up to an altitude of about 6 km and tropospheric profiles up to an altitude of 10 km. Precipitation radar measurements started in mid-2020, with the current sensor configuration being operational since mid-2021. The dataset will be continuously extended in near real time with the goal of providing a consistent, high-resolution long-term data record for atmospheric and climate sciences.The temporal resolution of the datasets ranges from 2.5 min for precipitation radar and GNSS-derived datasets to 10 min for radiometer-derived datasets. Precipitation and cloud data cubes are provided on a 200 m by 200 m Cartesian grid, with height level resolution ranging from 20 m near the surface, to 200 m at 10 km altitude. These height levels adequately cover the sensor resolution of the observed tropospheric profiles.The Level 1b dataset (Kvas et al., 2024a, https://doi.org/10.25364/WEGC/WPS3D-L1B-10) and the Level 2 dataset (Kvas et al., 2024b, https://doi.org/10.25364/WEGC/WPS3D-L2-10) are published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license on the WegenerNet Data Portal (https://wegenernet.org/portal/3ddownload/, last access: 9 January 2026) and are described with standardized metadata formats. The data portal offers users several convenient options for exploring and downloading the individual datasets. These include visualization tools for selected data variables, web interfaces for manual subsetting of datasets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for automated or scripted downloads."

DoD2k contains 4781 unique records assembled from 5 curated databases using DT2k. We analyze for common features across moisture and temperature sensitive records, and we test cave carbonate data simulations against observations. DoD2k is expected to be useful for attributing climate change on decadal timescales and for improving data models and paleoclimate reconstructions. 
 We present a merged database of five curated databases (DoD2k version 2.0.0) developed for Common Era (1–2000 A.D.)  paleoclimate research. A toolkit to create the database is also provided and leverages codebases developed by individual database developers and the paleoclimate data informatics communities over the past decade.  It includes Python notebooks for (1) loading each database from its public repository, using a common, compact set of terms for metadata and data management; (2) their merger using that common set of dictionary terms; (3) a multistage algorithm to identify candidate duplicates; (4) an operator-supervised, semiautomated decisionmaking procedure, checking against a common set of metadata and comparison metrics; and (5) creation and checking of the finalized, duplicate-free database across 22 dictionary terms.  Each of the curated databases, which arise from individual, community and PAGES (Past Global Changes) 2k working groups, represent a range of development approaches, from single archive, single observation datasets with a range of reported environmental responses, to multiarchive-multiobservation collections which target a specific climate response.The resulting DoD2k spans 13 archive types, 37 data types, and 4781 records within the Common Era. We illustrate the value of the DoD2k with two applications.  In the first, we extract the moisture (M) and temperature (T) sensitive subset of records and perform an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on the resulting multi-archive, multi-observation MT-sensitive dataset.  In the second, we show that calcite speleothem oxygen isotopic composition is consistent with that simulated using simple models of this proxy system. DoD2k may also be useful for paleoclimatic detection and attribution analysis using proxy system modeling, data assimilation, and deep learning for the development and testing of improved proxy system models.

 Two field measurement campaigns were carried out in the Dutch Wadden Sea in winter 2023–24 and in early spring 2025. The campaigns were designed to understand and quantify sediment transport and exchange between morphological units at two spatial scales: on larger scale between two adjacent tidal basins and on smaller scale between individual channels and shoals. These observations support ongoing research to better understand sediment dynamics in the Wadden Sea, and thereby to improve sediment management strategies essential for maintaining coastal functions in the Dutch coastal system over short (days–months) to long (decades) timescales."

Sanz;Clemens Schwingshackl;Stephen Sitch;Giacomo Grassi,The LULUCF Data Hub: translating global land use emissions estimates into the national GHG inventory framework,"We created the LULUCF Data Hub to make information on how land use affects carbon dioxide emissions and removals more transparent and comparable among datasets. We show country-level data from national reports and global sources, allowing users to explore differences and similarities in land-based carbon fluxes. It helps identify where data agree, where they differ, and where more research is needed. 
 Global estimates of anthropogenic land use CO2 fluxes from bookkeeping models and dynamic global vegetation models, as well as those derived from Earth observations (EO), can differ widely from those obtained by aggregation of national GHG inventories (NGHGI). These discrepancies are mostly due to conceptual differences, reflecting varying definitions (or system boundaries) of anthropogenic CO2 fluxes, particularly on the forest carbon sink. This study presents a new online platform ‒ the ""LULUCF Data Hub"" ‒ which compiles various datasets of country-level CO2 emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Through a multi-disciplinary collaboration, results from two key global initiatives ‒ one based on carbon cycle modelling (Global Carbon Budget, GCB 2024) and one on Earth Observations (Global Forest Watch, GFW 2024) ‒ are ""translated"" to conceptually align with NGHGI definitions. We compared these global approaches to the 2024 NGHGI data submitted to the UNFCCC under the Paris Agreement reporting rules (cut-off date April 2025). The aim is to enhance comparability and foster consensus on anthropogenic land-use CO2 flux estimates. Translating definitions between datasets considerably improves the match in land use CO2 flux estimates, both globally and for most countries. At the global level, NGHGI indicate that LULUCF is a net sink of -3.4 Gt CO2 yr-1 (2001–2023 average; 2023 estimate is an extrapolation for all NGHGI), whereas GCB reports a net source of +4.7 Gt CO2 yr-1. This +8.1 Gt CO2 yr-1 discrepancy drops to +1.8 Gt CO2 yr-1 when GCB fluxes are translated to NGHGI definitions. When the global net forest-related flux of -5.8 Gt CO2 yr-1 estimated by the GFW model (sum of fluxes from Forest and Deforestation including organic soils) is limited to a proxy of managed forest area, the sink declines to -3.5 Gt CO2 yr-1, closely aligning with NGHGI (-3.2 Gt CO2 yr-1 for forest-related flux only, including Forest, Deforestation, and organic soils in Indonesia). Despite improved alignment in magnitude after translation, some differences persist in global CO2 flux trends: in the last two decades, forests (including re/afforestation) have remained a roughly constant net sink in NGHGI and GCB but are a declining net sink in GFW; deforestation emissions are stable or slightly declining in NGHGI and GCB but increase in GFW. For other land uses, NGHGI globally reports a greater sink than GCB (the GFW model does not include other land uses). At the country-level, we identify both convergences and divergences in CO2 flux estimates between NGHGI and the translated datasets – in sign, magnitude and trend. Notably, after translation, estimates of both GCB and GFW still differ from individual NGHGI values in 19 countries by more than ±0.1 Gt CO2 yr-1 on average (2001–2023), highlighting areas that deserve further investigation."

It integrates over 4 million vertical profiles with 35 million vortex observations. The dataset, processed using advanced computing, is openly accessible and offers a foundation for studying the role of ocean vortices on weather, climate, and ecosystems. 
 Satellite altimetry has revolutionized our understanding of ocean physics by providing global sea-surface height data. These measurements reveal the intricate dynamics of ocean mesoscale strain and vortices, and their interactions with multiple physical scales in the oceans. Although surface dynamics has been extensively studied, investigating the vertical structure of mesoscale eddies globally remains a computational challenge. In this study, we combine the comprehensive World Ocean Database (WOD) with a database of Eulerian mesoscale eddies (META3.2 DT). We pre-process and filter the WOD data, selecting quality controlled profiles at local depths greater than 100 m. By integrating WOD data with altimetry-derived mesoscale eddies, we aim to facilitate future studies on the role of mesoscale vortices in multiple processes, such as heat, mass and nutrient transport, and water-mass subduction. The analysis is performed using high-performance computing resources, with Python packages for parallel processing of the data and analysis of more than 4.2 million profiles with more than 35 million vortex observations. The dataset is available for download from Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17425853 (Simoes-Sousa et al., 2025) and by direct access through an OPeNDAP/HTTP server and an S3 bucket in icechunk format. Additionally, we provide the code for performing the vortex-profile matching, along with an example of use to facilitate future updates to the code and merged data. This dataset supports further research on eddy vertical structure, biogeochemical processes, and their role in climate systems across different regions and time periods."

As models become more detailed, traditional methods are too slow. TChem-atm runs on both standard processors and graphics processors, making these simulations faster and more efficient. The tool provides a foundation for next-generation models that improve predictions of air quality and climate. 
 We present TChem-atm, a performance-portable approach that enables efficient simulation of chemically detailed and multiphase atmospheric chemistry on modern heterogeneous computing architectures. Unlike previous efforts that rely on architecture-specific code or focus exclusively on gas-phase chemistry, TChem-atm supports fully coupled gas–aerosol systems with execution across CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, and AMD GPUs through the Kokkos programming model. It integrates the flexible multiphase capabilities of the Community Atmospheric Model Chemistry Package (CAMP) with the high-performance kinetic routines of TChem, and includes automatic Jacobian construction with support for a range of stiff ODE solvers. In a proof-of-concept integration with the particle-resolved model PartMC, TChem-atm reproduces the existing PartMC–CAMP implementation within solver tolerances and delivers substantial GPU speedups, especially for large particle populations. Performance benchmarks reveal substantial speedups on GPU platforms, particularly for large particle populations, with consistent results across hardware backends.  TChem-atm enables performance-portable execution across CPUs and GPUs, though optimal efficiency may require modest architecture-specific tuning (e.g., team and vector sizes), with up to a twofold improvement on the NVIDIA H100. It directly supports sectional and particle-resolved host models, while modal aerosol schemes require minor adaptation to provide particle-scale quantities such as representative diameters. By enabling chemically detailed, multiphase simulations with performance portability and host-model flexibility, TChem-atm facilitates the incorporation of advanced chemistry into atmospheric models."

Here, we analyzed the water quality of 20 kiosks from 4 different manufacturers across 6 states in the first comprehensive comparison of the chemical and microbial characteristics of kiosk water to paired tap samples. Of the 16 kiosks listing specific water treatment processes (others indicated “filtered” or “purified”), only 1 dispensed water with ionic composition (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+)  inconsistent with the stated treatment. Most kiosks tested used reverse osmosis (RO), which removed fluoride and residual disinfectant, although we found no evidence of microbial contamination. RO also provided the benefit of removing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. However, we frequently detected higher lead levels in kiosk water than in nearby tap water. Lead was detected (>0.05 μg/L, our method detection limit) in 15 kiosks; 5 were >1 μg/L (American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation), 2 were >5 μg/L (FDA allowable level for bottled water), and 1 was >10 μg/L (US EPA Action Level). Lead co-occurred with zinc and copper, consistent with corrosion of lead-containing plumbing materials. XRF analysis of plumbing in 2 kiosks from different manufacturers with nationwide distribution confirmed this suspicion although all components in question met the definition of lead free under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Lead release was most evident  with the use of RO treatment, which can produce corrosive water low in alkalinity and pH. Going forward, the removal of lead-containing plumbing components downstream of RO treatment and regulation with routine testing of kiosk water quality is imperative to address this unchecked public health risk."

However, conventional bioaccumulation assessments are costly, time-consuming, and low-throughput, limiting their utility for screening the growing array of emerging QACs. In this study, we developed a protein affinity ultrafiltration mass spectrometry (PA-UF-MS) strategy using human serum albumin (HSA) as a molecular bait to selectively isolate bioaccumulative QACs from disinfectants. We identified 12 traditional and emerging QACs, including several silanol alkyltrimethylammonium compounds (silanol-ATMACs), with strong HSA binding affinities [fold changes (FCs): 10.1–60.0]. Five silanol-ATMACs (C10–C18) were further structurally elucidated by MS/MS characterization and confirmed via a hydrolysis-based transformation experiment. In silico toxicokinetic modeling and in vivo rat experiments revealed longer elimination half-lives for silanol-ATMACs compared to ATMACs, indicating their bioaccumulation potential. These silanol-ATMACs were mainly detected in medical disinfectants with a median total concentration (∑silanol-ATMAC) of 779 mg/L. While detected at modest levels in indoor dust (median: 8.04 ng/g), silanol-ATMACs exhibited elevated concentrations in human serum, comparable to those of 18 traditional QACs (medians: 10.6 and 13.9 ng/mL, respectively). Our findings demonstrate the application of PA-UF-MS for prioritizing emerging bioaccumulative contaminants and highlight the need for further toxicological evaluation and human exposure assessment of silanol-ATMACs."

Here, we employed DNA quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP) using two VFAs, acetate and propionate, in cyclic anaerobic/aerobic incubations to assess their effects on P cycling and microbial activity with biomass from two full-scale EBPR water resource-recovery facilities that utilize VFA addition. We found that anaerobic VFA uptake preferences differed within known groups of PAOs, such as Candidatus Accumulibacter and Tetrasphaera-affiliated members (e.g., Ca. Phosphoribacter), between the two biomasses. The combination of qSIP with metagenomics identified isotopically labeled phages that were linked to active PAOs, highlighting their potential roles in modulating EBPR community composition and activity. The highest levels of anaerobic labeling from acetate were in genomes belonging to Saccharimonadales and Rickettsiales, which are generally host-associated with bacteria and eukaryotes, respectively. This finding highlights the possibility of cross-feeding between PAO hosts and their parasites or predators, as well as the role of so-far uncharacterized organisms participating in carbon cycling under EBPR conditions. Collectively, these results expand our understanding of the ecological interactions involved in communities anaerobically uptaking VFAs and cycling P that are central to EBPR."

This study investigated the Sb(V) adsorption mechanism on the (001) and (012) facets of hematite and the associated isotope fractionation mechanism, combining batch adsorption experiments, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that the adsorption capacity of the (012) facet is stronger than that of the (001) facet, with Sb existing in an edge-sharing complex form on the (001) facet, while edge and corner-sharing complex forms coexist on the (012) facet. The lighter Sb isotope is preferentially enriched on both facets through equilibrium fractionation, with the fractionation extent independent of pH and initial Sb concentration. Since the (001) facet contains fewer Sb atoms in the Sb–Fe shell, the complexation is weaker, resulting in a Sb isotope fractionation value (Δ123Sbaqueous-adsorbed = 14.11 ± 0.03 ‰) that is higher than that of the (012) facet (Δ123Sbaqueous-adsorbed = 9.8 ± 0.02 ‰).

However, the occurrence, mechanisms, and products of surface heterogeneous reactions remain poorly understood. Here, based on flow tube experiments, we show that cleaning-emitted reactive chlorine gases (RCGs) (containing ∼350 ppb chloramine) react with surface-sorbed aromatic and aliphatic amines, generating diverse transformation products, including nitrosamines, hydrazines, chlorinated species, and dimers. As an example, dibenzylamine exhibited a heterogeneous reaction rate constant of approximately 7.9 × 10–3 min–1 at 30% relative humidity (RH), corresponding to a half-life of ∼2.1 h, and with nitrosamine and hydrazine yields of 6.2% and 1.0%, respectively. Nontargeted analysis identified an extensive suite of additional products for different amines, generated through ring cleavage, hydroxylation, chlorination, oxidation, and dimerization. Product formation and reaction kinetics depend on RH, chloramine levels, and amine structures. We further confirmed the formation of these products during cleaning events in indoor environments. These transformation products exhibit greater environmental persistence than their parent amines, especially for chlorinated products, posing concerning exposure risks. Our findings demonstrate that heterogeneous reactions of surface-bound organic amines during cleaning form structurally diverse, persistent, and hazardous products─a process potentially applicable to a wide range of indoor contaminants."

Here, we present the most comprehensive life-cycle assessment to date using operational data from 46 recycling facilities in China, covering approximately 50% of the global capacity in 2023. We evaluate multiple recycling outputs, black mass, metal salts, precursors, and cathodes and reveal that new hydrometallurgical technologies for direct precursor and cathode recovery could reduce carbon emissions by 61% compared to mining production due to skipping multiple extraction steps. Real-world recycling often requires blending with virgin materials to maintain the targeted Ni–Co–Mn ratio for recycling the nickel–cobalt–manganese (NCM) precursor or cathode due to market preference for high-nickel chemistries. Our results show that, compared with virgin production, fully recycled cathode materials can reduce pack-level carbon footprint levels of lithium–iron phosphate (LFP) batteries by 11% (2–14%), significantly greater than previous estimates, and by 24% (12–27%) for NCM811 batteries. Coupled with dynamic fleet modeling, battery recycling is identified to cumulatively avoid 147–433 million tons of CO2 emissions in China by 2050. These insights offer important guidance for carbon footprint regulations and the advancement of circular economy practices globally."

However, the under-recognized pathway of irrigation-induced iodine transport from groundwater to topsoil and its redistribution mechanisms in agricultural systems remain critical knowledge gaps. This study investigated geogenic iodine dynamics in the Jianghan Plain agricultural system, where widespread high iodine groundwater (54.5–655 μg/L) drives irrigation practices. Field experiments and hydrogeochemical analyses revealed that 7 days of irrigation increased surface soil iodine by 27–99% (reaching 1.47–2.92 μg/g). Fe(II) oxidation during aeration drives iodine cycling via Fe(III) oxyhydroxide formation, immobilizing groundwater iodine and transforming iodide to organic iodine (16%) and iodate (11%). Organic matter (OM) played dual roles: as an iodine reservoir and precursor for organo-iodine compounds (OICs) formation. Using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, we identified 93 newly formed OICs in dissolved organic matter (DOM) of aerated groundwater and 54 additional OICs in water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) of postirrigation soil, with highly unsaturated groundwater DOM and aromatic soil WSOM facilitating iodination. This research highlights irrigation-induced Fe-OM-I interactions as critical for understanding geogenic iodine exposure risks, emphasizing overlooked irrigation pathways in agricultural environments and establishing irrigation as a key exposure vector requiring urgent policy integration."

Despite the existence of well-established probe methods for HO•, 1O2, and 3CDOM*, reliable techniques for quantification of the CO3•– and LOORs remain lacking. Here, we developed a multiple-probe chemical method capable of quantifying all five key PPRIs under solar irradiation. The method integrates two complementary probe sets: (i) a high-level probe set (5 μM terephthalic acid (TA), furfuryl alcohol (FFA), 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP), and 3,4-dimethoxyphenol (DMOP)) to determine 3CDOM* while suppressing the CO3•– and LOOR contribution, and (ii) a low-level probe set (0.1 μM 4-methylphenol, 0.05 μM TMP and DMOP, 5 μM TA and FFA) to quantify CO3•– and LOORs with minimal probe–probe interference. Using this framework, the five PPRIs were determined in both simulated and natural waters. Kinetic modeling revealed that at Br– < 10 μM, halogen radicals minimally affected the method accuracy, confirming its applicability to most freshwaters and wastewater effluents. Overall, this multiple PC method provides a practical, sensitive, and accessible tool for the simultaneous determination of five major PPRIs in sunlit waters."

We recently introduced how polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foam─or silicone foam─can be synthesized for passive air sampling, enabling simple and cost-effective nontarget chemical profiling of indoor air. Here, we demonstrate expanded applications, indoors and outdoors, with commercial PDMS-foam, including for: (i) wide-scope target analysis of >220 priority substances by quantitative liquid- and gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, (ii) microscopic characterization and nontarget profiling of accumulated fine particles, and (iii) effect-guided discovery of harmful substances, combining toxicological data with nontarget analysis in silico. Median method quantification limits were 0.12 ng/mL, 90% of target analytes had absolute recoveries between 70 and 130%, and hazardous substances were discovered, including ethylene glycols, insecticides, and UV filters. Microscopy revealed the accumulation of abundant fine particles, and the automated characterization of the fluorescent fraction revealed that most were <4 μm. Extracts from outdoor samples reduced human lung cell viability, and multivariate modeling flagged families of potentially toxic substances in a virtual effect-directed analysis. PDMS-foam disks require field calibration to determine their linear sampling rate(s), but current results and applications establish PDMS-foam as a multimodal passive sampler, enabling integrated chemical quantitation, toxicological analysis, and molecular discovery in air."

However, previous studies have primarily examined methane concentrations well above those found at most emission sources and have overlooked the role of realistic humidity. This work reports methane oxidation rates at 25 °C for oxide-based photocatalysts for methane concentrations ranging from 2 to 5000 ppm. Even under dry conditions with less than 2% relative humidity, residual water attracted to the hydrophilic surfaces of these photocatalysts severely inhibits methane oxidation. Thinning this water layer boosts methane oxidation rates by up to 1 order of magnitude. Furthermore, surface modification of titanium dioxide with a hydrophobic fluorosilane coating (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane) enables room temperature photocatalytic removal of dilute methane even under conditions with up to 80% relative humidity. These findings and engineering solutions offer guidance for the development of light-driven approaches for scalable methane removal."

However, a holistic understanding of the composition profiles of PPARγ agonists in complex environmental matrices remains elusive.

All mixed dust extracts activated PPARγ within the exposure concentration range (7.8 × 10–2–10 mg dust/mL assay medium). A total of 123 putative agonists covering 35 structural categories were found, among which 30 chemicals were verified as specific PPARγ agonists through reference standards and in vitro assays. These agonists could explain up to 84% of the effect in the mixed dust extracts, with phthalates (31% ± 19%), fatty acids (12% ± 9%), quaternary ammonium compounds (2% ± 1%), and hydrocarbon surfactants (2% ± 1%) being the major contributors.

The first type, “internal functional materials”, facilitates interspecies interactions and stimulates metabolic processes. The second type, “external functional materials”, mediates the exchange with external energy. We discuss the mechanisms of enhancing interspecies and extracellular electron transfer, which largely determine the microbial metabolism of substance and energy. We reflect on the remaining challenges in bringing functional materials to practical applications and clarify the potential suitable scenarios based on the properties of these materials. In the future, designing new functional materials using artificial-intelligence-driven models should necessitate identifying specific microbial metabolic mechanisms. This Perspective highlights innovative use of internal and external functional materials to boost microbial activity and electron transfer.  It also provides an intuitive interpretation for the rational design of functional materials to address the urgent need for materials in large-scale engineering applications."

Recently, it was shown that treating the exhaust gas with a combination of a scrubber and a wet electrostatic precipitator can significantly reduce particle number, mass, and black carbon concentrations in the exhaust of marine engines. In this study, the effect of the system on the secondary aerosol formation potential was investigated. The exhaust aerosol produced during heavy fuel oil combustion readily formed aged particle mass, with the majority of the mass consisting of sulfate. The combination of the scrubber and WESP reduced the aged PM to levels corresponding to air utilized for dilution of the exhaust. For sulfate, the detected reduction efficiency of the system was more than 99%. The system was also effective in reducing primary PM during both heavy fuel oil and marine diesel oil combustion.

Studies have assessed methane emission measurement systems but have not quantified the effect on methane emissions of oil and gas operator access to methane emission data. In this study, methane emissions were measured with and without operator access to real-time methane emission data (“data-on” and “data-off”) and fugitive emission alerts (“alert-on” and “alert-off”). In two U.S. producing basins, 46 wellsite, processing, and production facilities were monitored for 10 months. In Basin 1, average emission rates decreased nonsignificantly by 7% after alerts were turned on (data-on/alert-off to data-on/alert-on mode). In Basin 2, emissions decreased by 39% after alerts were turned on (at the transition from data-on/alert-off to data-on/alert-on). When both data and alerts were turned off for the operator (data-on/alert-on to data-off/alert-off), emissions were reversed, increasing by 85%. Wellsites emitted disproportionately more than facilities. Basin 1 sites exhibited a more coherent site design than Basin 2. These findings suggest that operator access to continuous methane monitoring data and site-specific alerts at oil and gas production sites may correlate with reduced methane emissions, particularly for assets with heterogeneous equipment vintages and design. Longer periods of study will help to solidify these findings."

Extensions are commonly made of human hair, other natural fibers, or synthetic fibers that may be treated with dyes, flame retardants, waterproofing agents, pesticides, antimicrobials, and conditioning agents with hazardous properties. Hair extension use may contribute to exposure and health disparities. We used nontargeted analysis (NTA) to understand the chemical composition of 44 hair samples. We performed suspect screening and NTA using two-dimensional gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. We used the Highlight machine-learning platform to annotate detected chemical features by comparing their mass spectra to those of the National Institute of Standards and Technology library. We detected 933 chemical signatures, with 5,275 total detections across all samples. We confirmed and tentatively identified 169 chemicals then classified their potential hazard using structure (e.g., organohalogens) and presence on public chemical lists. Nearly 10% of samples contained hazardous organotin compounds, including some above 0.4% (w/w) tin. Four organotin structures were confirmed with reference standards, and seven structures were solved de novo. The remaining structures are tentatively annotated but unambiguously contain tin or tin and halogens based on the unique isotope patterns and mass defects. Forty-eight chemicals confirmed and tentatively identified in hair extensions were on a hazard list including California’s Proposition 65. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive testing of hair extensions publicly reported.

We chronically exposed the medicinal leech Hirudo verbana for two months to four PFAS congeners at 1 nmol L–1 aligned with the EU Drinking Water Directive thresholds (PFAS total = 0.50 μg L–1): a legacy long-chain acid (PFOA), two short-chain ether replacements (HFPO-DA and PFMoBa), and an intermediate methoxy analogue (PFMOPrA). Histology, enzymatic histochemical staining, immunofluorescence, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction tracked the canonical inflammatory sequence, represented by CD11b+ granulocyte influx, CD31+ neovessel formation, and recruitment of CD45+/ACP+ macrophage-like cells, together with transcriptional responses of oxidative stress genes (SOD and GST) and two immune mediators (HvRNASET2 and HmAIF-1), chosen for their known role in leech innate immunity. PFOA and PFMOPrA sustained the full CD11b/CD45/CD31 cascade, maintained high ACP activity, and strongly upregulated HvRNASET2, HmAIF-1, SOD and GST, signaling stability, and tissue-remodeling inflammation. By contrast, HFPO-DA and PFMoBa induced a granulocyte influx but failed to promote macrophage recruitment or neovascularization; HvRNASET2 transcripts rose, whereas HmAIF-1 expression, ACP activity, and CD31 signal remained at the baseline. These outcomes suggest that while all PFAS trigger the same innate-immune program, only PFOA and PFMOPrA sustained its full development. Taken together, these observations suggest that multiple structural and bioactivity determinants, potentially including but not limited to the chain length, shape the sustained response at the chronic level in leeches. This supports the need for multitemporal, policy-relevant PFAS hazard assessment."

Although the majority of published literature indicates that sulfidation can significantly mitigate the toxicity of Ag NPs, it remains unknown how the degree of sulfidation influences nano-bio interactions of Ag NPs in mammalian cells. To elucidate the potential role of sulfidation in the cytotoxicity of Ag NPs, we first synthesized and characterized Ag NPs with varying degrees of sulfidation. Unexpectedly, while high-degree sulfidation resulted in a reduction of the cytotoxicity of Ag NPs, mild sulfidation intensified their toxicity. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that the oxidative dissolution of low-degree sulfidized Ag NPs enhanced the release of Ag+, promoted the generation of reactive oxygen radicals, and aggravated lipid peroxidation within cells, thereby activating ferroptosis through inhibiting the expression of ferritin and glutathione peroxidase 4."

These interactions influence effective radiative forcing, cloud dynamics, and precipitation patterns, yet remain insufficiently constrained due to limitations in observations, modeling, and process understanding. This uncertainty hampers robust policy advice across multiple domains—from estimating remaining carbon budgets and climate sensitivity, to anticipating regional extreme events and evaluating climate interventions such as solar radiation modification. In many cases, the influence of ACI is either underappreciated or excluded from decision‐making frameworks due to its complexity and lack of quantification. This perspective outlines a path forward to overcome these barriers by leveraging emerging opportunities in satellite remote sensing, ground‐based and airborne observations, high‐resolution climate modeling, and machine learning. We identify key areas where rapid progress is feasible, including improved retrievals of cloud microphysical properties, better representation of natural aerosols in a warming world, and enhanced integration of observational and modeling communities. Even as anthropogenic aerosol and its impacts on clouds is reducing owing to emissions controls, addressing ACI uncertainties remains essential for refining climate projections, supporting effective mitigation and adaptation strategies, and delivering actionable science to policymakers in a rapidly changing climate system."

This study documents the remotely sensed fire spread, intensity, and smoke emissions from the wildfires by leveraging fire and emission observations from multiple satellites. We found that during the first 24 hr after ignition, two main fires moved through urban settlements, under hurricane‐like Santa Ana winds, at rates of up to 3.7 km hr−1 while burning 75%–80% of the final fire areas, including all affected residential areas. We also report the first satellite‐derived intensities of wildfires burning through residential areas. With a mean intensity of 72–297 W m−2, these fires at night were significantly more intense than the contemporaneous vegetation fires in the Palisades Fire. Smoke emissions exhibited strong hourly variations that were closely coupled with temporal fire intensity patterns, and the emission coefficients (Ce) of carbon monoxide (CO), total particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were 146, 10.2–21.1, and 0.89 g MJ−1, respectively. In comparison between vegetation fires and residential‐area fires, CO Ce discrepancies suggest that residential fires likely released less CO emissions per unit of radiative energy, whereas temporal variations in NOx Ce discrepancies varied temporally indicate complex factors influencing Ce in wildfires occurring at the wildland‐Urban Interface. Our findings reveal the extreme characteristics of the Los Angeles wildfires and illustrate how integrated remote sensing imagery can provide critical wildfire information to support safe evacuation, firefighting operations, and air quality forecasting."

Both near‐surface and main pycnocline stratification are found to exhibit spatially structured, vertically coherent, global‐scale variations on seasonal‐to‐decadal time scales, suggesting that stratification at both levels are rapidly‐evolving and responsive components of the climate system. Variability in stratification is organized into well‐defined patterns that replicate the spatial footprints and time scales of major climate modes, pointing to these modes of variability as important drivers of stratification changes. Our diagnosed patterns and forcings of stratification variability provide a benchmark for advancing the climate models used to understand and predict the ongoing climate change."

Additionally, an analytical kernel is introduced, enabling the estimation of broadband radiative kernel values from boundary conditions such as TOA insolation, reflectance, and stratospheric AOD. Using these kernels, the stratosphere AREs of the 2022 Hunga volcanic eruption and the 2020 Australian wildfire are estimated. The Hunga eruption resulted in a global mean cooling effect of approximately −0.4 W/m2 throughout 2022. In contrast, the Australian wildfire induced a global mean instantaneous ARE of +0.3 W/m2 and a stratosphere‐adjusted ARE of −0.04 W/m2. Validation against radiative transfer model calculations confirms the accuracy of our kernel‐based estimates. The results demonstrate the significance of spectral dependencies in stratospheric ARE and highlight the distinct radiative sensitivities of stratospheric aerosols compared to their tropospheric counterparts. The developed radiative kernels provide an efficient and versatile tool for assessing the climatic impacts of stratospheric aerosols."

We develop an analytical model that captures this behavior by combining: (1) simple parameterizations of LW and SW CRE as functions of SW cloud optical depth; (2) a two‐phase cloud spreading model, incorporating both initial convective detrainment and subsequent radiatively driven expansion; and (3) a minimal cloud microphysics scheme. The model performs well when tested against data from a cloud‐resolving model simulation, suggesting it captures the essential physics governing anvil cloud lifecycles. Sensitivity tests reveal a strong dependence of the total net CRE on initial cloud temperature and the timing of convective initiation, and identify several microphysical and dynamical processes that may be relevant for high‐cloud feedbacks."

Warm extremes exhibit broadly linear trends: they are more intense and frequent in the early‐Holocene and weaken toward the pre‐industrial period. In non‐monsoon regions, these warm events respond directly to changes in solar radiation, with only a small seasonal lag. In Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions, increased pre‐monsoon precipitation cools the surface and suppresses warm extremes, while reduced precipitation amplifies them in the South American monsoon region. Notably, in Australia, a decrease in the warmest day temperature coincides with an increase in warm day frequency, reflecting opposing seasonal insolation effects on intensity versus frequency. Cold extremes are simpler relative to warm extremes: at low latitudes, they track winter insolation linearly—the coldest nights occur just after the annual insolation minimum, and their frequency changes accordingly. In contrast, Northern Hemisphere high‐latitude cold extremes show no clear response to orbital‐driven insolation change, likely because they occur during polar night when internal climate variability dominates. Our findings highlight that, under early‐Holocene orbital conditions, both warm and cold extremes are more intense and more frequent, in contrast to more warm extremes but less cold extremes in response to anthropogenic warming."

Accurately assessing these hazards requires modeling frameworks capable of capturing both the individual and combined effects of multiple flood drivers, as well as the diversity of flood scenarios that can arise from their interactions. In this study, we implemented a physics‐based, high‐resolution modeling approach to assess flood hazards in Philadelphia, PA, a coastal city exemplifying multi‐driver flood risks over multiple decades (1985–2019), by simulating a wide range of flood events at a 10‐m resolution. By integrating watershed, coastal, and urban flood models, we explicitly resolved the interaction between fluvial, pluvial, and coastal processes across the city. From these simulations, we identified flood hazard hotspots and systematically attributed the primary drivers of flooding for each event. The results suggested that 44% of Philadelphia's flood events were compound floods, primarily driven by fluvial‐surge and fluvial‐pluvial combinations. Notably, 77% of these events involved fluvial flooding, either as a single flood driver or in combination with other drivers, underscoring the dominant role of riverine processes in the city's flood hazard. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of a comprehensive, process‐based approach for urban flood hazard assessment and highlights the importance of considering the full spectrum of flood scenarios to inform targeted and adaptive flood management strategies in coastal cities."

In China, previous studies focused on the total area of mangroves using remote sensing technique, neglecting expansion of the exotic mangrove species Sonneratia apetala, even when it is encroaching on habitat of native species. We proposed a robust and interpretable approach to identify the exotic species, applied this approach to generate S. apetala map in China for 2024 using Sentinel‐1/2 imagery, and revealed its expansion since start of the SDGs by combining existing data sets. The approach, in the form of a decision rule—Sentinel‐1 VH (vertical transmit–horizontal receive polarization) ≥ −14.390 & Sentinel‐2 B11 (shortwave infrared band) < 0.084—achieved an overall accuracy of 97.0% for the S. apetala map. The total area of the exotic species in China for 2024 was 3675 ha, which is ∼1.25 times the area in 2020 and ∼1.99 times that in 2016. The expansion characteristics of the species were analyzed from multiple perspectives, including at the provincial level, inside and outside national mangrove nature reserves (NMNRs), and across NMNRs. Hotspots of expanded S. apetala were also identified, revealing that these regions are in varied expansion stages. We also reported area and expansion‐rate estimates with uncertainties. This study reveals whether a pixel from Sentinel‐1/2 imagery is inferred as S. apetala.

While global and basin scale trends in TC size have been examined previously, whether there have been regional changes over time remains unclear. Here, using a suite of observations and reanalyses, we detect an increasing TC outer size over the western North Atlantic during 1979–2022. Over the western subtropical North Atlantic where the largest changes are found, the area‐averaged increase in the radius of 17 ms−1 ${\text{ms}}^{-1}$ winds is about 7.5% over this period. Analysis of the large‐scale environment reveals that the air‐sea thermodynamic state has become more favorable for storm intensification, and thereby expansion, over that region.

In this retrospective study, the association between wildfire‐specific PM2.5 exposure and asthma‐related hospital encounters was evaluated among children (0–18 years old) in these two counties from January 2017 to February 2020 at a regional children's hospital. Distributed lag quasi‐Poisson regression models were used to assess short‐term impacts up to six days post‐exposure. Over 9,300 hospital visits were modeled and found that wildfire‐specific PM2.5 was associated with increasing asthma‐related hospital encounters. Specifically, each 10 μg m−3 increase in wildfire‐specific PM2.5 was associated with a 4% (95% CI: 0%–8%) increase in pediatric hospital encounter risk on the day of exposure, with additional 3%–4% increases on days 3 and 4 (95% CI: 1%–4% and 1%–6%, respectively). Cumulatively, these exposures corresponded to a 13% (95% CI: 9%–18%) increased risk over the five‐day lag period. Baseline hospital encounter risk varied across census tracts, reflecting underlying community vulnerabilities. Notably, wildfire‐related health risks were amplified in communities with high baseline vulnerability compared to communities with lower vulnerabilities. These findings quantify the risk of wildfire smoke in communities already facing environmental and socioeconomic disadvantages, emphasizing the need for targeted public health interventions in high‐risk areas."

Dessler,The True Cost of Heat: Evaluating Heat‐Related Mortality Estimation Methods in Texas,"Different ways of counting heat‐related deaths (HRD) can give you very different numbers. This study examines HRD in Texas using three different definitions: The Optimal Temperature Method (OTM) estimates mortality based on deviations from a community's optimal temperature, capturing the effects of both moderate and extreme heat exposure. This method finds that 2.2% of summertime Texas mortality were heat related over the period 2010–2023. The Extreme Heat Method (XHM) counts deaths associated with extreme temperatures; we find that temperatures exceeding the 95th percentile were responsible for 0.5% of summertime Texas mortality over this same period. This means that moderate heat is responsible for 77% of HRD, with extreme temperatures responsible for the rest. The Excess Death Method (EDM) approach quantifies the mortality burden as the increase in mortality compared to what would have occurred with the climate of a baseline period; we find that summertime Texas mortality over this period was 1.7% higher than with the climate of the mid‐20th century. When comparing these estimates to official HRD values from the State of Texas, which are based on an official determination that heat contributed to the death, we find that official State HRD numbers appear to substantially underreport HRD, attributing just 0.3% of summertime deaths to heat, with the XHM method being the closest."

In the present study of three mining‐impacted Peruvian towns, nearly 2,000 students collected and tested 1,500 soil samples using a field kit that combines simulated gastric extraction with visual detection of a purple Pb rhodizonate precipitate. An additional 2,000 soil samples were tested by our team's field staff. The combined results were mapped and compared with total soil Pb concentrations measured by X‐ray fluorescence (XRF). The degree of soil contamination varied across sites and within each site. Quality control was provided by reanalyzing a subset of 120 soil samples from the three sites in the laboratory. Overall, total Pb concentrations were highest in Cerro de Pasco with 64% and 30% of samples in the 201–2,000 and 2,001–20,000 mg/kg range, respectively. Total Pb concentrations were somewhat lower in La Oroya with 88% of samples in the 201–2,000 mg/kg range and even lower in Callao with 79% below 200 mg/kg. However, extractable Pb proportions followed an inverse pattern, with the sum of the proportions of medium and high visual readings increasing from 46% to 57% and 69% in Cerro de Pasco, La Oroya, and Callao, respectively. This trend relates more closely to blood‐Pb concentrations in children measured at the three sites 2 decades ago than total Pb concentrations.

 Identifying a catalyst class to optimize the enantioselectivity of a new reaction, either involving a different combination of known substrate types or an entirely unfamiliar class of compounds, is a formidable challenge. Statistical models trained on a reported set of reactions can help predict out-of-sample transformations1–5 but often face two challenges: (1) only sparse data are available i.e., limited information on catalyst–substrate interactions, and (2) simple stereoelectronic parameters may fail to describe mechanistically complex transformations.6,7 Here we report a descriptor generation strategy that accounts for changes in the enantiodetermining step with catalyst or substrate identity, allowing us to model reactions involving distinct ligand and substrate types. As validating case studies, we collected data on enantioselective nickel-catalyzed C(sp3)-couplings8 and trained statistical models with features extracted from the transition states and intermediates proposed to be involved in asymmetric induction. These models allow for the optimization of poorly performing examples reported in a substrate scope and are applicable to unseen ligands and reaction partners. This approach offers the opportunity to streamline catalyst and reaction development, quantitatively transferring knowledge learned on sparse data to novel chemical spaces."

 Aluminium comprises over 8% of Earth’s crust and is the most abundant metallic constituent1. Historically, aluminium catalysis has predominantly exploited the inherent Lewis acidity associated with its stable +III oxidation state2. Owing to its uniquely low electronegativity (1.61)—the lowest among p-block elements—and the absence of an inert-pair effect, aluminium presents formidable intrinsic challenges for engaging in catalytic redox transformations. Here we report the redox catalytic capability of a low-valent aluminium species, carbazolylaluminylene3, which carries out a complete Al(I)/Al(III) catalytic cycle encompassing oxidative addition, double insertion, intramolecular isomerization and reductive elimination—fundamental mechanistic steps conventionally exclusive to transition-metal catalysis. Leveraging this Al(I)/Al(III) redox cycle, we achieve highly efficient and regioselective Reppe cyclotrimerization of alkynes4,5, producing diverse benzene derivatives with a turnover number of up to 2,290. Through X-ray crystallographic and quantum chemical analyses, we elucidate how the dynamic nitrogen geometry within the carbazolyl ligand framework precisely modulates the aluminium coordination environment, thereby facilitating the catalytic cycle. This work fundamentally advances the conceptual understanding of main-group redox catalysis. It further sets a compelling precedent for future catalyst design and sustainable synthetic methodologies centred on aluminium redox transformations.

 Orthosteric inhibitors block enzyme active sites and prevent substrates from binding1. Enhancing their specificity through substrate dependence seems inherently unlikely, as their mechanism hinges on direct competition rather than selective recognition. Here we show that a molecular glue mechanism unexpectedly imparts substrate-dependent potency to CSN5i-3, an orthosteric inhibitor of the COP9 signalosome (CSN). We first confirm that CSN5i-3 inhibits CSN, which catalyses NEDD8 (N8) deconjugation from the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, by occupying the active site of its catalytic subunit, CSN5, and directly competing with the iso-peptide bond substrate. Notably, the orthosteric inhibitor binds free CSN with only micromolar affinity, yet achieves nanomolar potency in blocking its deneddylase activity. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the enzyme–substrate–inhibitor complex reveal that active site-engaged CSN5i-3 occludes the substrate iso-peptide linkage while simultaneously extending an N8-binding exosite of CSN5, acting as a molecular glue to cement the N8–CSN5 interaction. The cooperativity of this trimolecular CSN5i-3–N8–CSN5 assembly, in turn, sequesters CSN5i-3 at its binding site, conferring high potency to the orthosteric inhibitor despite its low affinity for the free enzyme. Together, our findings highlight the modest affinity requirements of molecule glues for individual target proteins and establish orthosteric molecular glue inhibitors as a new class of substrate-dependent enzyme antagonists. An orthosteric CSN inhibitor gains nanomolar potency via a molecular-glue mechanism, stabilizing a CSN5–N8–inhibitor complex that confers substrate-dependent inhibition despite weak free-enzyme affinity."

 Mpox, caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV; Orthopoxvirus monkeypox), is on the rise in West and Central Africa1–3. African rodents, especially squirrels, are suspected to be involved in MPXV emergence, but no evidence of a direct transmission to humans or non-human primates has been established4–9. Here we describe an outbreak of MPXV in a group of wild sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) in Taï National Park (Côte d’Ivoire). The outbreak affected one-third of the group, killing four infants. To track its origin, we analysed rodents and wildlife carcasses from the region. We identified a MPXV-infected fire-footed rope squirrel (Funisciurus pyrropus), found dead 3 km from the mangabey territory 12 weeks before the outbreak. MPXV genomes from the squirrel and the mangabey were nearly identical. A video record from 2014 showed a mangabey from this group eating the same squirrel species and diet metabarcoding of faecal samples collected from mangabeys before the outbreak identified two samples containing fire-footed rope squirrel DNA. One of these samples was also the first positive for MPXV. This represents a rare case of direct detection of interspecies transmission. Our findings indicate that rope squirrels were the source of the MPXV outbreak in mangabeys. Because squirrels and non-human primates are hunted, traded and consumed by humans in West and Central Africa10,11, exposure to these animals probably represents risk for zoonotic transmission of MPXV.

 Metal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have demonstrated excellent external quantum efficiency (EQE), easy colour tunability and low-cost processability, making them promising next-generation display techniques1–3. However, PeLEDs still underperform compared with organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with an EQE of about 40% because of insufficient charge confinement and defect-caused non-radiative recombination on the film surface. Here we report a spontaneously formed 3D/2D vertically oriented perovskite heterojunction by means of a simple one-step spin-coating method, which could effectively confine the charge carriers and shift the radiation zone away from the defect-rich surface region. Notably, the 2D perovskite on top exhibits a wrinkled surface morphology, which offers up to 45.4% light extraction efficiency. The resulting PeLEDs achieved an EQE of 42.9% for the green emission (certified 42.3%). Our work sheds light on the strategies for fabricating high-efficiency PeLEDs in the future.

Moreover, the substantial conformational flexibility observed in the GluN2A amino-terminal domain may explain its fast kinetics and dominant role in gating. Dynamic movements of S-ketamine were also captured at the channel vestibule, as was pore dilation in both the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of a native GluN1–GluN2B receptor. The latter observation represents a previously unknown fully open state of NMDAR. Our large collection of heterogeneous NMDAR structures from whole brain reveals previously unrecognized properties of conformational diversity and channel dilation. Analyses of heterogeneous assemblies of native NMDA receptors from whole-brain tissue of mice reveal new characteristics of conformational diversity and channel opening."

 Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes bulky adducts from genomic DNA and prevents the ultraviolet light-sensitivity disease xeroderma pigmentosum, cancer and premature ageing1. After initial lesion recognition by XPC in global genome repair or by stalled RNA polymerases in transcription-coupled repair, a lesion and surrounding DNA duplex are unwound by TFIIH, which includes the ATPases XPB and XPD, and additional NER factors XPA, XPF, XPG and RPA, to form a DNA bubble2 comprising around 27 nucleotides. The double strand–single strand (ds-ss) junction-specific endonucleases XPF and XPG cleave DNA on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the lesion, respectively. Here we report the functional steps and atomic structures of the ATPase-driven and lesion-dependent DNA bubble formation and arrangement of the complete NER factors for dual incision. The unwinding of nearly 30 base pairs of DNA depends mainly on the double strand DNA translocase XPB and the duplex dividers XPA and XPF. XPD binds the lesion strand with XPF at the 5′ ds-ss junction. XPF cuts the lesion strand only after XPG binds the 3′ ds-ss junction. The ERCC1 subunit of XPF facilitates DNA strand separation and recruitment of RPA to the non-lesion strand. These findings provide insights on the causes of human diseases and potential targets for enhancing chemotherapeutic efficacy. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of nucleotide excision repair complexes reveal the roles of the constituent proteins XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPF, XPG and RPA in DNA bubble formation and excision of the lesion strand."

 Caribbean reefs have experienced major human-driven changes to their coral and fish communities1–4, yet how these changes have affected trophic dynamics remains poorly understood owing to challenges in reconstructing the trophic structure of pre-human-impact reefs. Advances in fossil-bound protein nitrogen isotope (15N/14N) analysis now enable the reconstruction of ancient trophic dynamics5,6, as the 15N to 14N ratio reflects an animal’s trophic position7. Here we apply this method to modern and prehistoric (7,000-year-old) fish otoliths (ear stones) and corals from Caribbean Panama and the Dominican Republic, focusing on fishes occupying low to middle trophic levels. We find that although the trophic level typically declined in high-trophic-level fishes over time, it increased or remained unchanged in low-trophic-level fishes, indicating that modern food chains are 60–70% shorter than on the prehistoric reefs in both Panama and the Dominican Republic. Furthermore, across all trophic groups, we observed a marked reduction in dietary variation, with a 20–70% lower trophic range on the modern reefs compared to the prehistoric reefs. This pattern is best explained by less dietary specialization in modern reefs, consistent with less ecological complexity than in prehistoric reefs. These differences document and quantify the trophic simplification that has occurred on modern Caribbean reefs, a change that may increase their vulnerability to ecosystem collapse. Using nitrogen isotopes from ancient and modern fish otoliths and corals, the study shows Caribbean reef food webs are now 60–70% shorter and functionally less diverse, indicating human-driven trophic simplification and increased risk of collapse."

 Brain systems mediating responses to previously encountered threats provide critical survival functions. Fear memory and extinction are underpinned by neural representations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA)1–7, but the contribution of non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes, to these processes remains unresolved. Here, using in vivo calcium (Ca2+) imaging and causal astrocyte manipulations, we find that BLA astrocytes dynamically track fear state and support fear memory retrieval and extinction. By combining astrocyte manipulations with in vivo BLA neuronal Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiological recordings, we show that astrocyte Ca2+ signalling enables neuronal encoding of fear memory retrieval and extinction, and readout through a BLA–prefrontal circuit. Our findings reveal a key role for astrocytes in the generation and adaptation of fear-state-related neural representations, revising neurocentric models of critical amygdala-mediated adaptive functions.

 Spatial orientation enables animals to navigate their environment by rapidly mapping the external world and remembering key locations1. In mammals, the head-direction (HD) system is an essential component of the navigation system of the brain2. Although the tuning of neurons in other areas of this system is unstable—evidenced, for example, by the change in the spatial tuning of hippocampal place cells3 across days4–11—the stability of the neuronal code that underlies the sense of direction remains unclear. Here, by longitudinally tracking the activity of the same HD cells in the post-subiculum of freely moving mice, we show stability and plasticity at two levels. Although the population structure remained highly conserved across environments and over time, subtle shifts in population coherence encoded environment identity. In addition, the HD system established a distinct, environment-specific alignment between its internal representation and external landmarks, which persisted for weeks, even after a single exposure. These findings suggest that the HD system forms long-lasting orientation memories that are anchored to specific environments. Longitudinal tracking of individual head-direction cells in the post-subiculum of freely moving mice reveals a cell population structure that shifts subtly with exposure to different environments but otherwise remains highly stable."

 Inhibitory receptors like PD-1 and CTLA-4 contribute to T cell dysfunction in cancer1–3. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking the interactions in trans of these receptors with their ligands on cancer cells or in the tumour microenvironment lead to clinical responses in some but not all types of cancer. Signalling lymphocytic activation molecule 6 (SLAMF6, also known as Ly108) is a homotypic receptor preferentially expressed on progenitor or stem-like exhausted T (Tpex) cells, but not on terminally exhausted T (Tex) cells, as demonstrated in mouse models4–9. In contrast to Tex cells, Tpex cells retain the capacity for functional restoration after immune checkpoint blockade10–12. The role of SLAMF6 in T cells remains ambiguous, as it has both activating and inhibitory effects, complicating its evaluation as a therapeutic target. Here we find that SLAMF6 was triggered in cis by homotypic interactions at the T cell surface. These interactions elicited inhibitory effects that suppressed activation of T cells and limited anti-tumour immunity, independently of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells. mAbs against human SLAMF6 with a robust ability to disrupt the cis interactions strongly augmented T cell activation, reduced the proportions of exhausted T cells and inhibited tumour growth in vivo. Collectively, these findings show that SLAMF6 functions exclusively as a T cell inhibitory receptor, which is triggered by cis homotypic interactions. They also position SLAMF6 as a promising target for therapies aimed at enhancing anti-tumour immunity, regardless of SLAMF6 expression on tumour cells.

 Lymphoedema is a chronic debilitating disease caused by impaired lymphatic drainage and is characterized by tissue swelling, fat expansion, inflammation and fibrosis1,2. However, the exact mechanisms that drive lymphoedema are poorly understood. Although lymphatic vessels are known to transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the systemic circulation3, the importance of impaired lymphatic drainage for cholesterol clearance in humans and its relevance to lymphoedema remain unknown. Here we show that lymphatic drainage insufficiency in human lymphoedema leads to excessive cholesterol accumulation in the lymphoedematous dermal tissue and around lymphatic vessels. Cholesterol deposition resulted in dermal adipose tissue remodelling, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction, progressing to death and dermal fibrosis. Surgical intervention improved lymphatic drainage and reduced cholesterol deposition. Using two mouse models that reproduce features of human lymphoedema, we demonstrated that tissue swelling and dermal adipose tissue remodelling were ameliorated by the cholesterol-depleting agent cyclodextrin. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that cyclodextrin restored lymphatic drainage by promoting the regeneration of lymphatic vessels. This study unravels the role of impaired cholesterol clearance in driving lymphoedema and identifies tissue cholesterol as a promising therapeutic target for this currently incurable disease. Mouse models show that lymphoedema caused by impaired lymphatic drainage is ameliorated by removal of cholesterol deposits, which promotes the regeneration of lymphatic vessels."

 The spin supersolid—a magnetic analogue of the supersolid that simultaneously exhibits solid and superfluid orders—has emerged as a promising sub-Kelvin refrigerant with strong low-energy fluctuations and associated entropic effects1. However, the stringent prerequisites have so far confined its presence to certain magnetic insulators. Here we report the discovery of a metallic spin supersolid in a rare-earth compound EuCo2Al9 (ECA), which is a good metal with excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. The high-spin Eu2+ ions form a three-dimensional lattice with stacked triangular layers, in which the spin-supersolid state is stabilized through a mechanism involving both Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) and dipolar couplings. Neutron diffraction shows microscopic evidence of spin supersolidity, demonstrating the coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane spin orders in this alloy. Our RKKY–dipolar model successfully captures the metallic spin-supersolid Y and V phases in ECA, along with the 1/3 magnetization plateau. The observed nonclassical magnetization behaviours within these phases point to significant quantum fluctuations, probably enhanced by the conduction electrons. The resistivity measurements provide a transport probe for the spin-supersolid transitions, because of scattering of conduction electrons from local moments. Through the adiabatic demagnetization process, ECA achieves ultralow cooling to 106 mK, exhibiting a giant magnetocaloric effect that manifests sharp anomalies in the magnetic Grüneisen ratio. ECA emerges as one of the first metallic spin supersolids, combining low cooling temperature, large magnetic entropy and ultrahigh thermal conductivity for high-performance sub-Kelvin refrigeration.

 Ancient DNA studies revealed that, in Europe from 6500 to 4000 bce, descendants of western Anatolian farmers mixed with local hunter-gatherers resulting in 70–100% ancestry turnover1, then steppe ancestry spread with the Corded Ware complex 3000–2500 bce2. Here we document an exception in the wetland, riverine and coastal areas of the Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, using genome-wide data from 112 people 8500–1700 bce. A distinctive population with high (approximately 50%) hunter-gatherer ancestry persisted 3,000 years later than in most European regions, reflecting incorporation of female individuals of Early European Farmer ancestry into local communities. In the western Netherlands, the arrival of the Corded Ware complex was also exceptional: lowland individuals from settlements adopting Corded Ware pottery had hardly any steppe ancestry, despite a Y-chromosome characteristic of people associated with the early Corded Ware complex. These distinctive patterns may reflect the specific ecology that they inhabited, which was not amenable to full adoption of the early Neolithic type of farming introduced with Linearbandkeramik3, and resulted in distinct communities where transfer of ideas was accompanied by little gene flow. This changed with the formation of Lower Rhine–Meuse Bell Beaker users by fusion of local people (13–18%) and Corded Ware associated migrants of both sexes. Their subsequent expansion then had a disruptive impact across a much wider part of northwestern Europe, especially in Great Britain where they were the main source of a 90–100% replacement of local Neolithic ancestry.

 The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in 229Th at around 148.4 nm (refs. 1–6) offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the realization of a nuclear clock7,8. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation of large ensembles of 229Th nuclei in transparent crystals6,9–11 and the development of pulsed vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lasers12–14, have enabled initial laser spectroscopy of this transition15–17. However, the lack of an intense, narrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation8,18. Here we introduce and report a continuous-wave (CW) laser at 148.4 nm, generated by means of four-wave mixing (FWM)19 in cadmium vapour. The source delivers more than 100 nW of power with a projected linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength tunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth over all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm (refs. 12–14,20). We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique that places a stringent upper bound on FWM-induced phase noise, thereby supporting the feasibility of sub-hertz VUV linewidths. Our work addresses the central challenge towards a 229Th-based nuclear clock and establishes a widely tunable, ultranarrow-linewidth laser platform for potential applications across quantum information science21–24, condensed-matter physics25 and high-resolution VUV spectroscopy26.

 Goal-directed navigation requires animals to continuously evaluate their current direction and speed of travel relative to landmarks to discern whether they are approaching or deviating from their goal. Striatal dopamine release signals the reward-predictive value of cues1,2, probably contributing to motivation3,4, but it is unclear how dopamine incorporates an animal’s ongoing trajectory for effective behavioural guidance. Here we demonstrate that cue-evoked striatal dopamine release in mice encodes bidirectional trajectory errors reflecting the relationship between the speed and direction of ongoing movement relative to optimal goal trajectories. Trajectory error signals could be computed from locomotion or visual flow, and were independent from simultaneous dopamine increases reflecting learned cue value. Joint trajectory error and cue-value encoding were reproduced by the reward prediction error term in a standard reinforcement learning algorithm with mixed sensorimotor inputs. However, these two signals had distinct state space requirements, suggesting that they could arise from a common reinforcement learning algorithm with distinct neural inputs. Striatum-wide multifibre array measurements resolved overlapping, yet temporally and anatomically separable, representations of trajectory error and cue value, indicating how functionally distinct dopamine signals for motivation and guidance are multiplexed across striatal regions to facilitate goal-directed behaviour. Cue-evoked striatal dopamine release in mice encodes bidirectional trajectory errors, spatially and temporally separated from value coding, reflecting the relationship between the speed and direction of ongoing movement relative to optimal goal trajectories."

 Volumetric additive manufacturing has emerged as a promising technique for the flexible production of complex structures, with diverse applications in engineering, photonics and biology1,2. However, present methods still face a trade-off between resolution and volumetric build rate, restricting efficient and flexible production of high-resolution 3D structures. Here we propose a method, called digital incoherent synthesis of holographic light fields (DISH), to generate high-resolution 3D light distributions through continuous multi-angle projections with a high-speed rotating periscope without the requirement of sample rotation. The iterative optimization of the holograms for different angles in DISH maintains 19-μm printing resolution across the 1-cm range that is far beyond the depth of field of the objective and enables high-resolution in situ 3D printing of millimetre-scale objects within only 0.6 s. Acrylate materials in a range of viscosities are used to demonstrate the general compatibility of DISH. Integrating DISH with a fluid channel, we achieved mass production of complex and diverse 3D structures within low-viscosity materials, demonstrating its potential for broad applications in diverse fields.

 Polyatomic molecules provide complex internal structures that are ideal for applications in quantum information science1, quantum simulation2–4 and precision searches for physics beyond the standard model5–9. A key feature of polyatomic molecules is the presence of parity-doublet states. These structures, which generically arise from the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom afforded by polyatomic molecules, are a powerful feature to pursue diverse quantum science applications7. Linear triatomic molecules contain ℓ-type parity-doublet states in the vibrational bending mode, which are predicted to exhibit robust coherence properties. Here we report optically trapped CaOH molecules prepared in ℓ-type parity-doublet states and realize a bare qubit coherence time of

            , which is longer than the 0.36 s lifetime of the bending mode10,11. We suppress differential Stark shifts by cancelling ambient electric fields using molecular spectroscopy and characterize parity-dependent trap shifts, which are found to limit the coherence time.

 Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum computers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum information non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a shared fermionic state whose occupation—either even or odd—defines the fermionic parity that encodes the qubit1. Notably, this parity can only be accessed by a measurement that couples two Majoranas to each other. A promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain1, implemented in quantum dots coupled using superconductors2. Even the minimal two-site chain hosts a pair of Majorana modes, often called ‘poor man’s Majoranas’, which are spatially separated but offer limited protection compared with longer chains3–5. Here we introduce a measurement technique that reads out their parity through quantum capacitance. Our method couples two Majoranas and resolves their parity in real time, visible as random telegraph switching with lifetimes exceeding a millisecond. Simultaneous charge sensing confirms that the two parity states are charge neutral and remain indistinguishable to a probe that does not couple the modes. These results establish the essential readout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a long-standing experimental challenge.

 Sleep is viewed typically through a brain-centric lens, with little known about the role of the periphery1,2. Here we identify a sleep function for peripheral macrophage-like cells (haemocytes) in the Drosophila circulation, showing that haemocytes track to the brain during sleep and take up lipids accumulated in cortex glia due to wake-associated oxidative damage. Through a screen of phagocytic receptors expressed in haemocytes, we discovered that knockdown of eater—a member of the Nimrod receptor family—reduces sleep. Loss of eater also disrupts haemocyte localization to the brain and lipid uptake, which results in increased brain levels of acetyl-CoA and acetylated proteins, including mitochondrial proteins PGC1α and DRP1. Dysregulation of mitochondria, reflected in high oxidation and reduced NAD+, is accompanied by impaired memory and lifespan.

 Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the first relativistic quantum field theory, describes light–matter interactions at a fundamental level and is one of the pillars of the Standard Model (SM). Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits1, making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius rp, constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of rp from recent measurements2–7 of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen8,9. This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S–6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of rp and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result ν2S–6P = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of rp = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far.

 Quantum key distribution (QKD) makes use of the principles of quantum mechanics to enable provably secure communication1,2. One substantial challenge persists in building large-scale QKD networks with many clients over long communication distances3. Although quantum relays continue to pose practical difficulties4, existing trusted-node networks5–9, point-to-multipoint networks10,11 and wavelength-multiplexed entanglement networks12,13 encounter issues such as reliance on trusted intermediaries or limited distances. Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) provides a compelling architecture that can overcome those issues while enhancing communication distance14. Although long-distance point-to-point TF-QKD has been achieved15–21, realizing large-scale networks requires scalable quantum devices. Here we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of an integrated-photonics TF-QKD network with exceptional scalability and reliability. This network includes 20 independent client-side QKD transmitter chips with one server-side optical microcomb chip. The microcomb generates a broad range of ultralow-noise coherent frequency combs with Hz-level linewidths, which serve as seeds and references for all client chips. Each client chip regenerates ultralow-noise light phase-locked to microcombs and prepares quantum keys. We sequentially implement pairwise QKD across 20 client chips through ten wavelength-multiplexed channels, with each surpassing the repeaterless bound at 370 km in spooled fibre, achieving a networking capability (client pairs × communication distance) of 3,700 km. We further demonstrate the wafer-scale reproducibility of both server-side microcomb chips and client-side QKD transmitter chips, together establishing system-level scalability. Combining mass-manufacturability, cost-effectiveness and high scalability of integrated photonics with long-distance quantum communication represents a viable path to large-scale quantum networks. A lab-scale proof-of-principle demonstration of a quantum network comprising one server chip and 20 client photonic chips implementing twin-field quantum key distribution shows excellent scalability and reliability and yields a pathway towards future large-scale networks."

 Electrocatalytic CO₂ reduction (ECO₂R) presents a sustainable pathway for industrial decarbonization by converting CO₂ into carbon-neutral fuels and chemicals. Despite progress in catalyst design, industrial scalability is hindered by slow mass-transfer kinetics. Here, we introduce a high-diffusion-flux gas diffusion electrode (HDF-GDE) that overcomes this limitation in alkali-cation-free systems, achieving CO₂ conversion rates at industrial current densities. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that conversion is governed by mass transfer efficiency rather than flow rate. By optimizing the GDE structure to maximize CO₂ diffusion and GDE utilization, we realize a kW-scale ECO₂R system with stability (>1000 hours), producing CO or C₂H₄ depending on the catalyst. Operating with a 3 L/min CO₂ flow rate, the system delivers 144 kg of CO (1.29 kW) or 17 kg of C2H4 (1.95 kW) over 1000 h. The alkali-cation-free ECO2R system, equipped with HDF-GDEs, demonstrates economic viability for large-scale ECO2R-to-CO/C2H4 production. Our findings bridge the gap between lab innovation and real-world deployment, advancing carbon-neutral chemical manufacturing.

 Interactions between genes or cis-regulatory elements (CREs) underlie many biological processes. High-throughput CRISPR screens have allowed researchers to assess the impact of activation or repression of gene and regulatory elements on many phenotypes. However, assessment of interactions between those genes or elements remains limited. To enable efficient highly-multiplexed control of regulatory element activity, we combine a hyper-efficient version of Lachnospiraceae bacterium dCas12a (dHyperLbCas12a) with RNA Polymerase II expression of long CRISPR RNA (crRNA) arrays. We demonstrate this system with several activation and repression domains, in cultured primary immune cells, and to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells. We also develop approaches to use dCas12a for simultaneous activation and repression. Lastly, we demonstrate that dHyperLbCas12a effectors can be used to dissect the independent and combinatorial contributions of CREs to gene expression. These tools create possibilities for highly multiplexed control of gene expression in many biological systems. CRISPR/Cas9 screens have identified genetic contributions to many phenotypes.

 Ice accumulation poses a significant threat to aviation safety and energy infrastructure. Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces offer a promising anti-/deicing strategy; however, their excessive heat absorption in summer accelerates material degradation and exacerbates urban heat island effects, highlighting the urgent need for dynamic thermal regulation. In this study, we present a self-regulated photothermal storage superhydrophobic film with a trilayer design, comprising a photothermal phase-change base layer, a freeze-resistant thermochromic hydrogel interlayer, and a transparent superhydrophobic top layer. This multifunctional design enables seasonal adaptability, achieving 92% solar absorptance for efficient anti-/deicing in winter and 62% solar modulation to mitigate overheating in summer. This dual mode prolongs freezing time by 10-fold at −20 °C and lowers surface temperature by up to 17 °C in hot weather, demonstrating substantial potential for global building energy-savings. Additionally, its ultraviolet-blocking capability and durable superhydrophobicity ensure long-term durability performance in harsh environments. This work not only addresses the critical overheating challenge in photothermal materials but also advances the development of next-generation anti-icing systems.

The material exhibits enhanced structural stability, improved energy release, and low sensitivity, offering insights for designing high-performance energetic materials. 
 The formation of stable amorphous phases in rigid organic small molecules is fundamentally hindered by their pronounced crystallization tendency. This challenge is particularly acute in energetic materials, in which the amorphous phase must be stabilized without inert additives to preserve high energy density. Here, we overcome this longstanding obstacle by realising a stable amorphous energetic material based on the small molecule explosive (4,4′,5,5′-tetranitro-1H,1′H-2,2′-biimidazole-1,1′-diamine, DATNBI). The amorphous DATNBI (AEM-DATNBI) prepared via a melt quenching process, exhibits a glass transition temperature of 59.67 °C and demonstrates remarkable structural stability below this threshold, maintaining its integrity for over 24 hours at 60 °C. This stability originates from a synergistic interaction between the non-planar molecular framework and a three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network formed by -NH₂/-NO₂ groups. This unique amorphous structure not only enhances safety by suppressing hotspot formation but also accelerates energy release, leading to faster combustion and more complete decomposition. This study demonstrates a general strategy leveraging steric hindrance and intermolecular interactions, thereby extending the realm of amorphous materials to energetic compounds and other functional rigid organic small molecules. This work develops a strategy to construct a stable amorphous energetic material with self-healing capability via entropy-mediated solidification.

This research reveals that national inventories widely omit key sources and apply inconsistent methods, which lead to greatly under-reported emissions. 
 The wastewater sector is now increasingly targeting fugitive CH4 and N2O emissions. National inventory reports (NIRs) are central to tracking these non-CO2 emissions, yet the extent to which NIRs capture sector-wide wastewater emissions remain unclear due to inconsistent accounting methodologies, complex systems and large fluctuations across regions and time. Here we conduct a global analysis of wastewater GHG accounting in NIRs, which reveals widespread omissions of key wastewater pathways and methodological discrepancies. These shortcomings systematically underestimate sectoral emissions and undermine cross-country comparability. For 38 countries studied, we estimate an unreported gap of 52.0–73.2 million metric tons (MMT) of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) per year, largely from omitted pathways and underestimation at centralized wastewater facilities. Extrapolated globally, approximately 94–150 MMT CO2e yr−1 are under-reported, though precise quantification remains challenging due to the lack of detailed activity data. These findings underscore the need for more comprehensive and harmonized accounting approaches in future Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guideline revisions to strengthen wastewater GHG inventories.

 Early childhood represents a critical window of rapid brain growth and heightened vulnerability, yet the impacts of heat on development remain unclear. Here, using data from the Chinese National Cohort of Motor Development, comprising 101,228 children aged 3–5.5 years from 551 cities, we examined early-life exposure to ambient temperature. Within the observed range of 0–25 °C, we found that both prenatal and postnatal heat exposure were associated with increased risk of suspected neurodevelopmental delay. The exposure–response relationship followed a J-shaped pattern, with risk rising steeply at higher temperatures. Compared with the temperature of lowest risk, extreme heat (95th percentile) was linked to 35% higher risk during pregnancy and 53% higher risk from birth to age 3 years. Suspected neurodevelopmental delay risk increased across all examined heatwave definitions postnatally.

 This study examines how large-scale near-surface circulation is projected to evolve under anthropogenic forcing throughout the 21st century. Using a multi-model ensemble of 41 state-of-the-art Global Climate Models high emissions scenarios, we analyze changes in Weather Type (WT) frequencies, based on Sea-Level Pressure (SLP), as a function of global warming and estimate their Time of Emergence (ToE) from historical variability. Significant and robust trends are identified across key climatic regions, including shifts in anticyclonic types in subtropical high-pressure belts and the Mediterranean, westerly and cyclonic types in the Subantarctic, and unclassified types in the Mediterranean. While most robust signals emerge by the late 21st century, some changes in the Mediterranean are already emerging in the present decade. Overall, results reveal significant circulation changes in the coming decades, affecting dominant near-surface circulation modes globally.

 Deep-focus earthquakes (> 300 km depth) are widely distributed in global subduction zones, but their mechanism is still debated because the fine structure of deep subducting slabs is unclear. Here we use a modified double-difference tomography method to investigate 3-D P and S wave velocity (VP, VS) structures of the subducting Pacific slab beneath central Japan. A three-layered anomalous belt is revealed in the deep slab: the portion at 330-380 km depths shows low VP, low VS and high VP/VS ratio, whereas the up-dip (<330 km depth) and down-dip (>380 km depth) portions exhibit low VP/VS ratios. From top to bottom, these layers correspond to three distinct olivine states: (meta)stable α-olivine, unstable/transforming olivine, and stabilized β-olivine (wadsleyite). The high-VP/Vs zone may indicate water in and around the metastable olivine wedge, suggesting that deep-focus earthquakes could be triggered by metastable olivine phase transition, promoted by deep dehydration.

 Contemporary glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate, an irreversible trend closely associated with ongoing global warming. Approximately 290 million years ago, Earth experienced a comparable large-scale glacial retreat, marking a pivotal transition of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) toward a greenhouse condition. This profound climatic shift, termed the Artinskian Warming Event (AWE), has been extensively attributed to volcanic degassing. Nevertheless, how continental weathering shaped climate dynamics throughout this period remains enigmatic. To address this issue, we integrated multiple geochemical proxies indicative of the carbon cycle, volcanism, and weathering, and applied the Celine Model to constrain silicate weathering fluxes. Based on the coupled variations between mercury enrichment and estimated weathering flux during the Artinskian, we propose that the AWE was not only driven by volcanic degassing but also amplified by an abrupt drop in low-latitude mafic weathering flux, rendering this interval the most intense deglaciation phase of the LPIA.

 Climate change and increases in the frequency and severity of climate-driven wildfires, particularly in the western United States, has serious ramifications for enhanced downwind reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions, deposition, and critical load exceedances. Here we present a multi-decadal (2002 − 2021), harmonized model-data-driven study using the George Mason University North American Chemical Reanalysis (NACR) system and simulations including both “with-fire” and “without-fire” conditions to quantify the change in trends of fire activity and source contributions to total Nr emissions and deposition over the U.S. Our results show that fire activity has increased substantially in the western U.S., especially in the west-northwest U.S. for wildfires, and that this increase is associated with positive annual near-surface temperature and vapor pressure deficit anomalies compared to the period average. Major results and implications of this work are increasing trends in the contribution of climate-driven wildfires to higher Nr emissions, deposition, and critical load exceedances of up to 20-40% due to fires in the western U.S. There are also smaller increases (<5 %) in Nr deposition trends for the eastern U.S., which are related to greater occurrence and reporting of agricultural and prescribed burns.

 Between 10 and 6 ka, one of the most devastating ecological events for marine life was occurring as the well-ventilated, oxygen-rich glacial eastern Mediterranean deep waters had turned into a dead zone and organic matter accumulated in thick sediment layers, called sapropels. Numerous hypotheses on sapropel formation have been put forward, but a thorough evaluation of the potential drivers is yet missing. Our numerical modelling study, from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene, captures the onset and termination of sapropel formation S1. The predominant driver is the surface water buoyancy gain due to sea-level rise and surface warming during the deglaciation, which reduces ventilation and consequently causes a substantial oxygen decline at depth. During the African Humid Period, enhanced nutrient supply and continued low microbial activity in cold waters, where remineralisation occurs at greater depths, result in anoxia and S1 forms. Despite prevailing poor ventilation of the deep sea and continued high nutrient supply, S1 terminates at 7 ka due to higher microbial activity in a warming ocean, which curtails the flux of organic matter to depths. The primary causes of sapropel formation in the eastern Mediterranean are surface water buoyancy gain during deglaciation and enhanced nutrient supply, which lead to oxygen declines at depth, according to analyses of transient deglacial simulations."

 Atmospheric rivers cause extreme precipitation and sustain water resources in the western United States. Their occurrence has often been attributed to extratropical cyclones. Here, we apply a recently proposed multiscale index to atmospheric rivers identified from reanalysis data and show that their landfalls in this region are not merely synoptic-scale phenomena but are also driven by large-scale circulation independent of extratropical cyclones. Specifically, quasi-stationary waves with centers of action along the Eurasian and North American coasts form a circum-North Pacific pattern. This large-scale teleconnection pattern channels subtropical moisture toward the U.S. West Coast on intraseasonal timescales, enabling its constructive interference with extratropical cyclone-induced moisture transport. The resulting “intermediate” atmospheric rivers account for up to twice as much winter precipitation as purely synoptic atmospheric rivers and exhibit a stronger correspondence with high-category events. Recognizing this multiscale process will be critical for the improved understanding of their predictability, variability and projected changes.

 Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites offer unique capabilities for capturing diurnal variations and providing valuable insights into aerosol cycles. However, publicly available hourly aerosol products with sufficient accuracy remain scarce across Europe, Africa, and West Asia, primarily due to the lack of shorter-wavelength (< 0.6 μm) channels on the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite series. Therefore, we developed a novel “AeroTrans” deep learning framework to retrieve hourly aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm over land in 2021 from MSG-1/SEVIRI imagery, which offers wider spatial coverage through Indian Ocean Data Coverage (IODC). This framework integrates an advanced time-sequence Transformer architecture with transfer learning, utilizing pre-training and fine-tuning techniques. The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analysis revealed that satellite observations across multiple wavelengths contribute 38% to the AOD retrieval, followed by viewing geometry (34%). In comparison with ground-based AOD measurements, our model achieves high accuracy, with an average ten-fold cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.88 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.079. Additionally, our model maintains strong predictive performance in areas and periods lacking ground-based measurements, as evidenced by strong spatial- and temporal-based CV-R2 values ranging from 0.71 to 0.86. The model performance is significantly improved when withholding each continent, with accuracy increasing markedly (R = 0.71–0.78) compared to models trained without transfer learning (R = 0.23–0.47). Using the generated reliable 3-km-resolution AOD datasets, we capture pronounced diurnal aerosol variations, characterized by a gradual increase after sunrise, a peak around 10:00 UTC, and a decline by late afternoon, with average magnitude changes of approximately 26% ± 15% relative to the daily mean level (0.22 ± 0.14) on an annual scale, especially during the Northern Hemisphere summer, reaching 30% ± 19%. More importantly, we successfully tracked the rapid dispersion of aerosols and their transport process throughout the day during highly polluted events, driven by both natural and anthropogenic emissions, including dust storms, wildfires, and urban haze. These findings emphasize the unique value of our study for advancing aerosol research over under-monitored regions, particularly focusing on diurnal variations during extreme events."

 Rapid urbanization across many regions worldwide has significantly contributed to the growth of deprived urban areas (DUAs), often called slums or informal settlements. The lack of reliable geospatial information on their location and extent in many cities continues to hinder efforts aimed at improving living conditions. This study addresses this critical information gap by exploring a User- and Data-centric Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for accurately mapping these areas to support Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 11.1.1. In collaboration with local communities, governments, and international stakeholders, we co-designed an AI-driven strategy leveraging open Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial data acrosseight cities worldwide. Instead of relying solely on algorithmic precision, our method prioritizes local knowledge, iterative validation, and adaptive data collection. To achieve this, we developed a tailored multi-branch encoder-decoder convolutional neural network capable of integrating multi-modal data sources. Our approach incorporates an agile and iterativemodel refinement process, ensuring continuous feedback loops between AI design, data collection, and validation. Recognizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, we developed the IDEAtlas collaborative data collection platform - https://portal.ideatlas.eu/ - to enhance data quality and inclusivity. The resulting dataset (IDEABench) is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.17026/PT/X4NJII to facilitate continued research and development. Findings indicate that fusing multi-spectral EO data with urban morphometric features, particularly Sentinel-2 imagery and built-up density, provides the highest accuracy for identifying DUAs. Furthermore, improvements in reference data quality through the IDEAtlas platform led to increased mapping precision. However, the significant variability in accuracy across cities underscores the complexity of the task and suggests the need for supplementary geospatial data to complement EO-driven analysis.

 Depth-resolved soil moisture is hard to obtain at basin scale because satellites sense only the upper few centimeters and field profiles are sparse. We use Earth-observation (EO) predictors with limited profile data to map volumetric water content (VWC) at 10-cm intervals from 0–1 m in a permafrost-affected basin. The pipeline benchmarks tree ensembles and then applies Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)-guided selection to build a compact 12-predictor Extra Trees model, followed by block-wise mapping on 30-m grids. On an external 10% hold-out, the model achieves R2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 0.08 L/L, with > 80% of residuals within ± 0.10 L/L. Skill is stable through most layers but degrades at 90–100 cm, reflecting limited test support and weaker surface constraint at depth. SHAP attribution identifies permafrost presence, wetland extent, vegetation greenness, and terrain metrics as leading controls, with surface influences weaken below 50 cm. Residual diagnostics show no pronounced distance-to-river shift in residual centroids and no significant spatial clustering in site-mean residuals (Moran’s I).

 Modeling the driving mechanisms of economic activities among port cities helps reveal their interactions and spatial spillover effects, which is crucial for promoting coordinated regional economic development. Current mainstream models of these driving mechanisms are mostly based on machine learning integrated with the SHAP method, but often neglect spatial dependencies between samples—especially the implicit spatial relationships underlying port city economic activities. In recent years, AIS data has become an important tool for uncovering these implicit spatial relationships. Therefore, we propose the PortCity2Vec framework, based on AIS data and embedding representation learning, to explicitly capture implicit spatial relationships among port cities. Furthermore, we develop a spatial XGBoost model integrated with GeoShapley to incorporate these implicit spatial relationships, thereby revealing the driving mechanisms behind socioeconomic indicators and quantifying the core roles of spatial relationships and geographic features in the port economy. The results show that: (1) Implicit economic interactions among port cities extend beyond physical adjacency, indicating that port economy is influenced not only by physical proximity but also by connections within an implicit spatial structure; (2) Introducing socioeconomic indicators and geographic features of nearby port cities within the implicit spatial structure improves model accuracy, increasing R2 from 0.6554 to 0.8541; (3) The port economy correlates positively with cargo turnover and grain crop output, but negatively with forestry and meat output. These findings highlight the key roles of economic and transport intensity and reveal resource allocation gaps. (4) Embeddings of implicit spatial relationships and geographic features effectively capture regional potential economic connections and marginal contributions that traditional models struggle to identify, thereby enhancing both the performance and interpretability of the model."

 Indoor exposure to semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) is affected by their sorption onto indoor surfaces such as clothes, toys, building materials and furniture. They are transferred from these contaminated surfaces to the body via various routes such as skin contact, inhalation or hand-to-mouth transfer. Knowledge of their sink surface/air partition coefficients KSurf are needed to apply indoor fate models and assess occupants’ exposure to SVOCs.Partition coefficients of triphenyl phosphate (TPP), 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) and 1,2-cyclohexane-dicarboxylic acid, dinonyl ester (DINCH) on cotton, glass and stainless steel (SS) surfaces were experimentally determined using two different methods. In the Micro-Chamber/Thermal Extractor (M-CTE), Kcotton values were close to 104 m. For this method, improvements were proposed to investigate the sorption on surfaces having lower sorption capacities such as glass or SS. In the sandwich-like emission cell, Kglass and KSS values ranged from 20 to 465 m, and from 99 to 1570 m, respectively. In coherence with the literature, sorption on cotton was higher than on SS and glass. Moreover, based on literature data, the SVOC vapor pressure (VP) could be a good predictor of KSurf for non-porous surfaces such as SS and glass. For porous surfaces (cotton), additional parameters related to the surface (porosity or composition) should be used with VP. Strong sorption capacity of cotton reinforces the health risk posed by contaminated clothes. This study highlights the need for further research to understand the key parameters of SVOC sorption on textiles."

 Inorganic ions are ubiquitous in aerosol microdroplets, especially in sea salt aerosols (SSAs). However, the molecular mechanisms by which inorganic ions regulate redox reactions in microdroplets remain unclear. We nebulized water microdroplets containing various inorganic salts to simulate SSAs and investigated the effects of different ions on the spontaneous oxidation of L-cysteine in microdroplets. By modulating the concentration, charge, and ionic radius of inorganic ions, we found that cations at certain concentrations enhanced the spontaneous oxidation of L-cysteine by influencing the electric double layer of microdroplets. The spontaneous oxidation of thiols was progressively enhanced with the increasing concentration of transition metals, which acted as electron acceptors. Anions with larger ionic radii formed free radicals and also promoted oxidation. Our results confirmed the critical role of inorganic ions in the spontaneous oxidation of thiols in aerosol microdroplets. Furthermore, the research provided new insights into the atmospheric transformation of sulfur-containing pollutants, which is of great importance for the global sulfur cycle and climate change."

 Surface ozone (O3) exhibits spatiotemporal variability in the New York City metropolitan area (NYCMA) under the influence of complex mesoscale flows which transport O3 and its precursors. Fine-scale ambient air quality monitoring is critical for estimating air pollution exposure and assessing whether mitigation strategies are sufficient to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. To improve air quality monitoring in the NYCMA, 38 New York State Mesonet (NYSM) sites were outfitted with well-calibrated low-cost O3 sensors. This study applies the Satellite Enhanced Data Interpolation (SEDI) method to bias-correct 1-year of gridded output from the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) through fusion with surface O3 observations from the NYSM low-cost sensor sites and instruments from the U.S. EPA's AirNow monitoring network. Prior to bias correction, WRF-Chem overestimated O3 concentrations at 11 NYCMA AirNow sites. Constraining WRF-Chem using the NYSM low-cost sensor sites alone reduced mean bias error by around 6 ppb at the AirNow sites. At NYSM sites, the gridded O3 dataset constrained by observations from NYSM and AirNow together resulted in a better-performing dataset compared to the dataset constrained using observations from AirNow alone. These results highlight the value added by low-cost sensors in filling observational gaps in existing regulatory monitoring networks. Additionally, the SEDI algorithm is a computationally inexpensive post-processing technique that effectively reduces error and bias and is enhanced by the increase in spatial resolution of air quality monitoring provided by integrating the NYSM low-cost sensor sites with the AirNow network."

 Previous studies rarely consider the regional disparity in precipitation variability beyond the overall consistency in Northeast China (NEC). This study examines the spatial distribution and variability of spring precipitation in NEC, a critical region for grain production that is prone to precipitation-related natural disasters. Our results indicate that approximately 26.7% of spring precipitation events in NEC demonstrate a dipole pattern—characterized by contrasting precipitation distributions within the region—that is significantly influenced by low-pressure systems. Our analysis reveals a strong connection between these precipitation patterns and the preceding winter's sea ice conditions in the Kara Sea. Reduced sea ice leads to a decrease in Ural Mountain snow cover, lower surface albedo, and an increase in upward heat flux, thereby warming the lower atmosphere. This process weakens the meridional temperature gradient, slows the westerly jet stream, and intensifies cyclogenesis over NEC. Moreover, persistent anomalies in sea ice and snow cover drive the eastward movement of Rossby waves, shaping the “− + −” Eurasian teleconnection pattern that intensifies regional low-pressure systems. Consequently, these circulation patterns result in increased precipitation in northern NEC and decreased precipitation in the south. Additionally, numerical experiments using the CAM6.0 and LBM model were conducted to investigate the atmospheric response to sea ice loss and the subsequent dynamical mechanisms affecting precipitation in NEC. Therefore, variations in Kara Sea ice and Eurasia snow cover serve as predictive indicators for NEC's spring precipitation pattern, thereby enhancing our understanding of NEC's precipitation dynamics and providing vital insights for predicting and managing regional natural disasters."

Increasing evidence suggests that circular RNAs have crucial functions in the brain, such as regulating neuronal transmission and synaptic plasticity. However, the specific molecular mechanisms by which circular RNAs function remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated howcircHomer1, a brain-enriched circular RNA derived from theHomer1gene, affects hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Our results demonstrate thatcircHomer1plays a vital role in mediating the dendritic targeting of messenger RNAs that encode postsynaptic proteins by acting as a molecular bridge between the motor protein Kinesin 1 and core components of neuronal ribonucleoprotein granules, including Fused in Sarcoma and Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, at dendrites. This interaction influences synaptic function, the structural morphology of dendritic spines, and hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory. Thus, our study highlights a role of circular RNAs in mediating synaptic messenger RNA targeting to shape dendritic spines and consequently neuronal functions."

YORU successfully classified several types of social behaviors in species ranging from vertebrates to insects. Furthermore, YORU enables real-time behavior analysis and closed-loop feedback. In addition, we achieved real-time delivery of photostimulation feedback to specific individuals during social behaviors, even when multiple individuals are close together.

Hainan gibbons (Nomascus hainanus) feature a mysterious rebound, from ~13 individuals in 2003 to 42 currently. Using reliable genomic data from the fecal samples of 18 gibbons, generated through a systematically established pipeline, and from four museum specimens, our analyses reveal that Hainan gibbons have the smallest effective population size and low genetic diversity but, unexpectedly, low inbreeding and genetic load among threatened primates assessed thus far. This results from a millennial expansion mitigating bottleneck effects and a high local recombination maintaining selection efficiency. Notably, we uncover two cryptic lineages, whose recent crosses led to new family groups with increased heterozygosity. Our study reveals the importance of demographic history, genome architecture, and behavioral regulation in the recovery of endangered species and highlights the great potential of fecal genomic research in conservation biology."

The current dogma is that vertebrates develop cone-dominated retinas first, adding rods later. Here we show that larval deep-sea fishes have “hybrid” photoreceptors, expressing cone-specific genes in rod-like cells. Through development, they either retain these rod-like cones (inMaurolicus mucronatus) or transition to true rods expressing rod-specific genes and transcription factors (inVinciguerria mabahissandBenthosema pterotum). Unlike most marine fish larvae, which inhabit brightly lit waters, deep-sea fish larvae experience deeper and dimmer environments. By combining rod-like morphology with cone-like molecular machinery, hybrid photoreceptors likely maximize visual performance under such conditions. Consistently, spectral maxima predictions and environmental light estimations suggest tuning to the prevailing light environment throughout life. Our findings provide molecular, morphological, and functional evidence for the evolution of an alternative developmental trajectory for vertebrate vision."

Second-order fluctuations indicate event clustering. These observations contradict periodic or quasiperiodic recurrence models. Comparisons with paleoseismic data from other tectonic settings and realistic synthetic catalogs confirm the robustness and broad applicability of these findings.

This internalization is coincident with epigenetic changes that are associated with modulation of macrophage responses to inflammatory stimuli. Furthermore, MBV treatment differentially alters chromatin accessibility as a function of cell differentiation state (i.e., myeloid progenitor versus macrophage).

Although chemical gradients are known to drive diffusiophoretic migration of colloids, these nonequilibrium forces have largely been ignored in porous media flows. Under typical subsurface conditions, flow velocities within preferential pathways exceed phoretic velocities by orders of magnitude, suggesting that diffusiophoresis would be limited to stagnant pockets. Here, using microfluidic experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling, we show that even moderate solute gradients, typical of natural mixing, can markedly alter colloid transport. We uncover a previously overlooked effect: cross-streamline phoretic migration within preferential flow pathways, which changes macroscopic dispersion by orders of magnitude and suppresses the impact of geometric disorder on transport. Our findings challenge classical models of colloid transport, highlighting the broad implications of solute gradients for technological, biomedical, and environmental applications."

However, their application in orchestrating T cell responses remains limited. Here, we develop a biomimetic magnetoelectric nanoparticle (DC@CFO/BFO) by coating core-shell CoFe2O4@BiFeO3particles with dendritic cell membranes to enable selective targeting of CD4+T cells. Under magnetic field stimulation, DC@CFO/BFO localizes to ribosomes and enhances protein synthesis by modulating electrostatic interactions at the ribosomal exit tunnel. This ribosome-targeted modulation promotes type II immune response via IL-4 induction and TAF9B-dependent transcriptional programming, thereby enhancing T helper 2 (TH2) cell proliferation. In murine models of colitis and arthritis, both systemic administration of DC@CFO/BFO and adoptive transfer of magnetoelectricity-responsive TH2 cells attenuated inflammation and restored immune homeostasis. In contrast, these effects were abrogated inTaf9b-deficient T cells, underscoring the essential role of TAF9B in mediating this response. Collectively, our findings identify magnetoelectric nanocomposites as a potent tool for T cell engineering and highlight a translational strategy for the treatment of autoimmune inflammation."

However, the mechanisms underlying this neurotoxic process remain unclear. Using PD patient-derived and CRISPR-engineered induced pluripotent stem cell midbrain dopaminergic neurons lacking DJ-1, we identified defective sequestration of cytosolic DA into synaptic vesicles, which culminated in DA oxidation and α-synuclein pathology. In-depth proteomics, state-of-the-art imaging, and ultrasensitive DA probes uncovered that decreased vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) protein and function impaired vesicular DA uptake, resulting in reduced vesicle availability and abnormal vesicle morphology. Furthermore, VMAT2 activity and vesicle endocytosis are processes dependent on adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), which is notably reduced in DJ-1–deficient dopaminergic neurons. ATP supplementation restored vesicular function and alleviated DA-related pathologies in mutant dopaminergic neurons. This study reveals an ATP-sensitive mechanism that regulates DA homeostasis through VMAT2 and vesicle dynamics in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, highlighting enhanced DA sequestration as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD."

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first committed step in this pathway and has long been viewed as a cytoplasmic enzyme. Here, we reveal that PAL responds to elevated flavonoid levels inArabidopsisby undergoing phosphorylation and relocating to the nucleus. Nuclear sequestration of PAL reduces its cytoplasmic abundance and enzymatic activity, resulting in rapid suppression of phenylpropanoid metabolic flux. In parallel, nuclear-localized PAL interacts with the transcription factor TT8, disrupting MBW complex formation and down-regulating flavonoid biosynthetic genes. This dual mechanism enables PAL to act as a metabolic feedback regulator that dynamically adjusts flavonoid production in response to internal metabolic states. Our findings redefine PAL as both a biosynthetic enzyme and a responsive integrator of cellular metabolic status, establishing a previously unknown paradigm for feedback control in plant specialized metabolism."

Traditionally, they were thought to depend primarily on the evolutionarily “newer” direct corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway. However, recent studies suggest that the “older” indirect corticospinal pathways, mediated by spinal premotor interneurons (PreM-INs), also contribute, highlighting the need to clarify their functional differences. Here, we recorded neuronal activity from PreM-INs and CM cells in macaques during a precision grip task to compare their roles in generating hand muscle activity. Our results show that PreM-INs exert stronger facilitation across a broader set of muscles, promoting synergistic coactivation, whereas CM cells provide more selective facilitation, enabling control of relatively individual muscles. Decomposition analysis further revealed that these systems correspond to different control modes—synergy-based and individual-based control—balancing stability and flexibility. These findings redefine our understanding of primate dexterous hand control as emerging from the cooperative integration of evolutionarily distinct premotoneuronal systems."

As a full characterization is prohibitively resource intensive, recent work has focused on developing methods to efficiently extract a few parameters of interest, in a so-called verification framework. Most existing approaches are based on preparing an ensemble of nominally identical and independently distributed (IID) quantum states and then measuring each copy of the ensemble. However, this leaves no states left for the intended quantum tasks and the IID assumptions do not always hold experimentally. To overcome these challenges, we experimentally implement quantum state certification (QSC), which measures only a subset of the ensemble, certifying the fidelity of multiple copies of the remaining states. We use active optical switches to randomly sample from sources of two-photon Bell states and three-photon GHZ (Greenberger-Horn-Zeilinger) states, reporting statistically sound fidelities in real time without destroying the entire ensemble. In addition, our QSC protocol removes the assumption that the states are identically distributed (but still assumes independent copies); can achieve closeN−1scaling, in the number of states measuredN; and can be implemented in a device-independent manner. Together, these benefits make our QSC protocol suitable for benchmarking large-scale quantum computing devices and deployed quantum communication setups relying on entanglement in both standard and adversarial situations."

Conventional sensitivity-enhancement strategies rely on reactive surface modifications, which may risk long-term stability, whereas inefficient gas-solid interaction time limits detection sensitivity. Here, we find gas vortex effects in butterfly wings that can prolong molecular residence time and apply this bioinspired mechanism to gas sensor design to resolve this trade-off. We establish a universal design rule: Periodic microcavities with diameter-to-height ratios of 1 to 1.33 generate centralized vortices that prolong molecular residence time by 85% and optimize mass transfer efficiency, as validated through computational fluid dynamics, fluorescence tracking, and Sherwood number analysis. This geometric principle enables metal oxide (ZnO, In2O3, Co3O4, and WO3) sensors to achieve ultralow detection limits (0.8 to 30 parts per billion) while maintaining long-period stability. A four-channel microsensor array leveraging vortex-enhanced microstructures enables real-time profiling of human breath biomarkers.

Monoamine neurotransmitters released in target brain regions conjointly regulate adaptive learning and plasticity. However, our understanding of these multianalyte mechanisms remains nascent, in part due to limitations in measurement technology. Here, during associative conditioning in honey bees, we concurrently tracked subsecond fluctuations in octopamine, tyramine, dopamine, and serotonin in the antennal lobe, where plasticity influences odorant representations. By repeatedly pairing an odorant with subsequent sucrose delivery, we observed individual differences in the conditioned response to odor, which occurred after a variable number of pairings (learners) or not at all (non-learners). The distinction between learners and non-learners was reflected in neurotransmitter responses across experimental conditions. The speed of learning, the number of pairings prior to a proboscis extension reflex, could be predicted from monoamine opponent signaling (octopamine-tyramine), from both the first presentation of the odorant alone, prior to any pairing with sucrose, and the first conditioned response to the odorant, coming after a number of sucrose pairings. These results suggest that monoamine signaling phenotypes may relate directly to the now widely reported socially relevant genetic differences in honey bee learning."

However, their practical implementation is impeded by the low operating rate threshold (<1 milliampere per square centimeter) and poor cycling stability, owing to dendritic sodium (Na) growth. Here, a high-rate and durable AFSB is successfully realized via a spatially anion-confined electrolyte strategy. Specifically, positively charged nanoparticles are introduced into the electrolyte to selectively anchor anions, generating localized contact ion pair–dominated solvation to facilitate rapid Na+desolvation at electrode interface and form an anion-derived solid electrolyte interphase. Meanwhile, rapid ion transport in the bulk electrolyte is maintained by the solvent-separated ion pair solvation structure in the nanoparticle periphery. These factors conjointly enable flat and dense Na deposition at high current densities. Consequently, an energy-type Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)O2||Al full cell exhibits an energy density of 415.6 watt-hour per kilogramcathode+anodeeven at 1 C (2.1 milliamperes per square centimeter) with 70.2% capacity retention over 400 cycles.

The neuronal membrane–associated periodic skeleton (MPS), an actin spectrin–based cytoskeletal lattice, is known to restrict clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in axons, but its broader role in other neuronal compartments and endocytic pathways remains unclear. Here, we show that all four major endocytic pathways—CME, caveolin-, flotillin-, and fast endophilin–mediated endocytosis—are spatially gated by the MPS and occur exclusively within MPS-free “clearing” zones throughout all neuronal compartments. Disrupting the MPS broadly enhances both basal and ligand-induced endocytosis. We also identify a previously unknown feedback loop in which ligand-triggered endocytosis activates extracellular signal–regulated kinase signaling, promoting protease-mediated spectrin cleavage and MPS disruption, which in turn facilitates further endocytosis. Furthermore, the MPS limits amyloid precursor protein endocytosis, thereby suppressing Aβ42 production and linking MPS integrity to neurodegeneration. Our findings establish the MPS as a dynamic, signal-responsive modulator coupling membrane trafficking with cortical cytoskeletal organization and neuronal health."

Instead, these particles also include cytochromeb6fcomplexes. Furthermore, our steric clash analysis demonstrates that stacked membranes contain a mixture of larger PSII supercomplexes (C2S2M2and C2S2) in addition to a smaller complex (C2). This suggests that in vivo PSII supercomplexes exist in an equilibrium distribution of differing sizes.

Here, we fabricate a unique 3D photonic antiferromagnetic topological insulator with net zero magnetization that can simultaneously support different-dimensional hinge states and unpaired surface Dirac cones on neighboring facets. Owing to the chiral anomaly present in a finite-size sample, the gapless surface Dirac cone, neighbored by facets with surface Dirac masses of opposite signs, is further converted, exhibiting 2D planar one-way propagation. In conjunction with 1D hinge states, we experimentally observe a closed chiral loop for nonreciprocal hinge–surface transport across dimensions in topological photonics, similar to that theoretically proposed in 3D quantum anomalous Hall materials.

Torque control is achieved via two mechanisms: (i) reversing the handedness of circular polarization to break rotational symmetry and (ii) displacing optical ring vortices and modulating cluster rotation speed. These complementary controls provide robust, high-resolution torques tuned in arbitrary directions. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate full three-dimensional orientation control of a single cell.

In addition, we uncovered an unexpected but conserved allosteric site across the transmembrane helices TM2 to TM4 of ORs, occupied by BMS187 but not BMS122.

Animal studies demonstrate that MPAM-15 shows excellent brain penetration and enhances morphine-induced antinociception without exacerbating respiratory depression or constipation. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that MPAM-15 promotes and stabilizes the conformational equilibrium of μOR toward the canonical active state, providing a mechanistic basis for its enhanced allosteric potency.

We quantify the effects of more than 50,000 single and double amino acid substitutions on activity and abundance and use thermodynamic modeling to disentangle changes in fold stability and catalysis. The comprehensive energy landscape reveals that allostery across the kinase domain is extensive, directionally biased, and modulated by its regulatory domains. Inhibitory—but not activating—allosteric mutations show a strong distance-dependent decay away from the active site.

10.1126/sciadv.adz3323,False,Science Advances,该论文主要关注阿尔茨海默病的基因调控机制，涉及非编码DNA变异和表观遗传学分析，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析、气溶胶反演）无关。,[],Di Huang and Ivan Ovcharenko,Silencer variants are key drivers of gene up-regulation in Alzheimer’s disease,"The genetic mechanisms of ~90% of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)–associated variants residing in noncoding DNA remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed a deep learning framework that integrates bulk histone modification data with single-cell open chromatin profiles to evaluate the regulatory potential of noncoding variants. This model identified 1457 silencer and 3084 enhancer AD-associated variants in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, classifying gene loci as silencer-only (SL), enhancer-only (EN), or dual-function (ENSL). EN loci predominantly regulate housekeeping metabolic processes, SL loci (includingMS4A6AandHLA-D) are linked to immune responses (with ~70% substantially up-regulated in AD microglia), while ENSL loci are implicated in neurofibrillary tangle assembly. Our model achieves robust power in assessing the impact of regulatory variants, with ~70% directional concordance with experimental results. It identified rs636317 as a putative causal silencer variant, distinguishing it from a neutral variant located 11 base pairs away. This study advances understanding of the AD-associated regulatory landscape and provides a framework for ascertaining noncoding variants in AD pathogenesis."

Optical neural networks promise greater speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency but suffer from weak optical nonlinearities. Here, we demonstrate a low-power, incoherent-light-compatible optical extreme learner that leverages “data nonlinearity” from optical pattern reverberations, eliminating reliance on intrinsic nonlinear materials. By encoding input data in the spatial polarization distribution of a tailored optical cavity and allowing light to pass through it multiple times, we achieve nonlinear transformations at extremely low optical power. Coupled with a simple trainable readout, our optical learner consistently outperforms linear digital networks in standard image classification tasks and XOR benchmarks, delivering accuracy matching fully nonlinear digital models. Our compact, energy-efficient approach substantially reduces complexity, cost, and energy consumption, paving the way for practical, scalable all-optical machine learning platforms."
