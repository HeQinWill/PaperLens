10.5194/acp-25-3623-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了2022年汤加火山爆发对大气环境的影响，特别是其向平流层注入大量水汽后，如何通过影响平流层和中层大气中的臭氧和温度，进而改变北极极涡的强度，并最终影响地表气候。研究使用了地球系统模型SOCOLv4进行模拟，揭示了富含水汽的火山爆发与地表气候异常之间的新联系。虽然没有直接提及特定的遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气成分分析、气候建模以及理解火山活动对大气环境的长期影响密切相关。,"['atmospheric composition', 'water vapor', 'ozone', 'stratospheric temperature', 'volcanic eruption', 'climate modeling']",Ales Kuchar;Timofei Sukhodolov;Gabriel Chiodo;Andrin Jörimann;Jessica Kult-Herdin;Eugene Rozanov;Harald H. Rieder,Modulation of the northern polar vortex by the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and the associated surface response,"In January 2022, the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano erupted, sending massive amounts of water vapour into the atmosphere. This event had a significant impact on stratospheric and lower-mesospheric chemical composition. Two years later, stratospheric conditions were disturbed during so-called sudden stratospheric warmings. Here we simulate a novel pathway by which this water-rich eruption may have contributed to conditions during these events and consequently impacted the surface climate. 
 The January 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai (HT) eruption injected sulfur dioxide and unprecedented amounts of water vapour (WV) into the stratosphere. Given the manifold impacts of previous volcanic eruptions, the full implications of these emissions are a topic of active research. This study explores the dynamical implications of the perturbed upper-atmospheric composition using an ensemble simulation with the Earth system model SOCOLv4. The simulations replicate the observed anomalies in the stratospheric and lower-mesospheric chemical composition and reveal a novel pathway linking water-rich volcanic eruptions to surface climate anomalies. We show that in early 2023 the excess WV caused significant negative anomalies in tropical upper-stratospheric and mesospheric ozone and temperature, forcing an atmospheric circulation response that particularly affected the Northern Hemisphere polar vortex (PV). The decreased temperature gradient leads to a weakening of the PV, which propagates downward similarly to sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) and drives surface anomalies via stratosphere–troposphere coupling. These results underscore the potential of HT to create favorable conditions for SSWs in subsequent winters as long as the near-stratopause cooling effect of excess WV persists. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between volcanic activity and climate dynamics and offer crucial insights for future climate modelling and attribution."
10.5194/acp-25-3669-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注气溶胶的吸湿增长特性与化学成分之间的关系，特别是在中国东南沿海城市厦门的新粒子生成日。研究通过原位观测，分析了新粒子生成日和非新粒子生成日气溶胶散射吸湿增长因子（f(RH)）的差异，以及气溶胶化学成分对f(RH)的影响。研究结果表明，硫酸盐和硝酸盐等化学成分对气溶胶的吸湿性有显著影响，尤其是在新粒子生成日，硫酸盐是f(RH)的主要贡献者。此外，有机气溶胶也是影响气溶胶吸湿性的关键因素。这项研究对于理解沿海地区气溶胶的吸湿特性，以及改进空气质量和气候变化模型具有重要意义。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究的气溶胶成分和吸湿性对于卫星遥感反演气溶胶光学特性和评估空气质量具有间接相关性。,"['aerosol hygroscopicity', 'aerosol chemical composition', 'air quality', 'climate change', 'sulfate', 'nitrate', 'organic aerosol', 'scattering hygroscopic growth factor']",Lingjun Li;Mengren Li;Xiaolong Fan;Yuping Chen;Ziyi Lin;Anqi Hou;Siqing Zhang;Ronghua Zheng;Jinsheng Chen,Measurement report: The variation properties of aerosol hygroscopic growth related to chemical composition during new particle formation days in a coastal city of Southeast China,"Here, we show differences and variations in the aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth factor (f(RH)) between new particle formation (NPF) and non-NPF days and the effect of aerosol chemical compositions on f(RH) in Xiamen with in situ observations. The findings are helpful for the further understanding of aerosol hygroscopicity in a coastal city and the use of hygroscopic growth factors in models of air quality and climate change. 
 The scattering of solar radiation by aerosol is significantly affected by relative humidity (RH) due to the aerosol hygroscopicity. In order to better understand the characteristics of aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth and its influencing factors during new particle formation (NPF) days, we conducted an in situ campaign from February to April 2022 in Xiamen, a coastal city in Southeast China. The aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth factor f(RH), commonly used to describe the aerosol indirectly hygroscopicity, varies greatly due to the influence of aerosol chemical composition and size. In the relatively clean atmosphere of Xiamen, NPF events occur frequently, and the variation in chemical composition during events has a substantial influence on the aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth. In this study, we investigated the features and influencing factors of f(RH) on the NPF days. The research results emphasized that f(RH) differed significantly between NPF and non-NPF days, mainly impacted by the aerosol chemical compositions, especially sulfate and nitrate. On NPF days, sulfate was the dominant contributor to f(RH), distinguishing it from the non-NPF days. Aerosol hygroscopicity–chemical composition closure demonstrated that NH4HSO4 was the main driving force (30.78 %) of the hygroscopicity parameter κf(RH) when NPF events happened, while NH4NO3 played a dominant role in κf(RH) (up to 35 %) for non-NPF days. Although the uncertainty of the organic aerosol (OA) to hygroscopicity might exist due to the varieties of chemical components and oxidation level, it was the crucial driving factor for the variation in aerosol hygroscopicity. The findings of this study would be helpful for the further understanding of the properties of aerosol hygroscopicity in the coastal area, and it would complement the hygroscopic growth factors in the models of air quality and climate change."

It investigates the relationship between the atmospheric structure and the layering of aerosols and trace gases. Results indicate an overall very shallow surface mixing layer. The height of this layer is strongly influenced by a local shallow wind. The study also provides information on the pollution chemical composition at different altitudes, including pollution signatures from power plants. 
 Vertical in situ measurements of aerosols and trace gases were conducted in Fairbanks, Alaska, during winter 2022 as part of the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis campaign (ALPACA). Using a tethered balloon, the study explores the dispersion of pollutants in the continental high-latitude stable boundary layer (SBL). Analysis of 24 flights revealed a stratified SBL structure with different pollution layers in the lowest tens of meters of the atmosphere, offering unprecedented detail. Surface emissions generally accumulated in a surface mixing layer (ML) extending to an average of 51 m, with a well-mixed sublayer (MsL) reaching 22 m. The height and concentrations within the ML were strongly influenced by a local wind driven by nearby topography under anticyclonic conditions. During strong radiative cooling, a drainage flow increased turbulence near the surface, altering the temperature profile and deepening the ML. Above the ML, pollution concentrations decreased but showed clear signs of freshly released anthropogenic emissions. Higher in the atmosphere, above elevated inversions, pollution levels were similar to previously reported Arctic haze concentrations, even though Fairbanks' outflow concentrations below elevated inversions were up to 6 times higher, likely due to power plant emissions. In situ measurements indicated that gas and particle tracer ratios in elevated power plant plumes differed significantly from those near the surface. Overall, pollution layers were strongly correlated with the temperature stratification and emission heights, emphasizing the need for improved representation of temperature inversions and emission sources in air quality models to enhance pollution forecasts."

Thomason;Christian von Savigny,Spatiotemporal variations of stratospheric aerosol size between 2002 and 2005 from measurements with SAGE III/M3M,"There is a natural and globally occurring layer of small droplets (aerosols) at roughly 20 km altitude in the atmosphere. In this work, the size of these droplets is calculated from satellite measurements for the years 2002 to 2005, which is important for the aerosol cooling effect on Earth's climate. These years are interesting because there were no large volcanic eruptions that would change the background state of the aerosols. The results are compared to reliable balloon-borne measurements. 
 Stratospheric aerosol size distribution parameters are derived from the multiple-wavelength aerosol extinction retrievals of the SAGE III/M3M instrument (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the Russian satellite Meteor-3M) and analyzed for their evolution between 2002 and 2005. The broad wavelength spectrum of the measurements enables us to derive all three parameters within an assumed monomodal lognormal size distribution. The 2002–2005 stratospheric aerosol layer was mostly at close to background conditions but included three moderate-magnitude tropical volcanic eruptions (Ruang, Reventador, and Manam). The SAGE III/M3M instrument measured only at middle and high latitudes, but derived particle size distribution (PSD) parameters indicate a reduction in particle size and an increase in particle number concentration after all three eruptions. In addition to this likely volcanic effect on the PSD, an influence of seasonal polar winter condensation events including meteoric smoke particles on the derived aerosol size is possible, especially due to the long-lasting low stratospheric temperatures during the northern winters of 2002/2003 and 2004/2005. During the same winters, polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) were likely observed by the instrument. A comparison of the derived stratospheric aerosol size dataset with balloon-borne in situ measurements in Kiruna, Sweden, shows generally good agreement, but there are systematic differences below roughly 15 km altitude. Finally, the effect of the necessary assumption of a PSD shape on the aerosol size derivation with remote sensing instruments is shown and discussed."
10.5194/acp-25-3635-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了2022年汤加火山爆发对2023/24年度和2024年度夜光云季的影响。研究利用微波临边探测仪（MLS）和臭氧绘图与剖面套件-临边剖面仪（OMPS-LP）的观测数据，分析了火山爆发释放的水汽对极地中层大气的影响，特别是对夜光云出现频率的影响。研究发现，火山爆发释放的水汽大约需要两年时间才能到达夏季极地中层顶区域，这与1883年喀拉喀托火山爆发后首次观测到夜光云的情况类似。虽然夜光云的出现频率没有明显扰动，但研究不能排除1月中旬至2月略有增加的现象是由火山爆发带来的额外水汽引起的可能性。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来分析大气成分的变化和火山爆发对大气的影响。,"['Hunga Tonga eruption', 'Noctilucent Clouds (NLCs)', 'Water vapor (H2O)', 'Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)', 'Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite – Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP)', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Satellite observations', 'Mesosphere', 'Polar mesopause region', 'Volcanic eruption impact']",Sandra Wallis;Matthew DeLand;Christian von Savigny,Did the 2022 Hunga eruption impact the noctilucent cloud season in 2023/24 and 2024?,"The 2022 Hunga Tonga – Hunga Ha'apai eruption emitted about 150 Tg H2O that partly reached the upper polar Southern Hemisphere mesosphere in the beginning of 2024. Noctilucent clouds (NLCs) did not show a clear perturbation in their occurrence frequency, but the slight increase from mid-January to February could potentially have been caused by the additional H2O. It needed 2 years to reach the summer polar mesopause region, analogous to the 1883 Krakatoa eruption that is argued to have caused the first sightings of NLCs. 
 The 2022 Hunga Tonga – Hunga Ha'apai eruption emitted approximately 150 Tg H2O into the middle atmosphere, which is still detectable 2 years after the event. Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations show that the Hunga H2O reached the upper polar mesosphere in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in the beginning of 2024, increasing the H2O mixing ratio in January by about 1 ppmv  between 70 and 80° S up to an altitude of 83 km. No clear signal was detected for the noctilucent cloud occurrence frequency inferred from Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite – Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) measurements. It cannot, however, be ruled out that a slight increase from mid-January to February is potentially caused by the additional water vapour from the Hunga event. Several months later, the water vapour anomaly reached the polar summer mesopause region in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the noctilucent cloud season in 2024. However, a subsequent anomalous warming during the second half of the season might have hindered the ice particle formation, leading to a decrease in occurrence frequency of the mesospheric clouds compared to previous years. To summarize, based on the analysis performed in the study, we show that the volcanic water vapour needs 2 years to reach the summer polar mesopause region. This resembles the Krakatoa case that is argued to have caused the first sightings of noctilucent clouds 2 years after its eruption in 1883."

Due to the limited historical precipitation data, there are certain biases in rainfall erosivity estimates in China. This study develops a new rainfall erosivity map for mainland China using 1 min precipitation data from 60 129 weather stations, revealing that areas exceeding 4000 MJ mm ha−1 h−1yr−1 of annual rainfall erosivity are mainly concentrated in southern China and on the southern Tibetan Plateau. 
 The risk of water erosion in mainland China is intensifying due to climate change. A high-precision rainfall erosivity dataset is crucial for understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall erosivity and identifying key areas of water erosion. However, due to the limited spatiotemporal resolution of historical precipitation data, there are significant biases in the estimation of rainfall erosivity in China, particularly in regions with complex terrain and climatic conditions. Over the past decade, the China Meteorological Administration has continuously strengthened its ground-based meteorological observation capabilities, establishing a dense network of observation stations. These high-precision precipitation data provide a reliable basis for quantifying rainfall erosivity pattern in China. In this study, rigorous quality control was performed on the 1 min ground observation precipitation data from nearly 70 000 stations nationwide between 2014 and 2022, ultimately selecting data from 60 129 stations. Using the data from these stations, event rainfall erosivity was calculated, producing a national dataset of mean annual rainfall erosivity with a spatial resolution of 0.25°. This dataset shows that the mean annual rainfall erosivity in mainland China is approximately 1241 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 yr−1, with values exceeding 4000 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 yr−1 primarily concentrated in southern China and the southern Tibetan Plateau. The mean annual rainfall erosivity in mainland China derived from previously released datasets was found to be 31 % to 65 % higher than the value calculated in this study, and basin-level discrepancies between our findings and other studies also vary significantly. In summary, the release of this dataset enables a more accurate assessment of the current intensity of water erosion in China. The dataset is available from the National Tibetan Plateau/Third Pole Environment Data Center (https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.301206; Chen, 2024)."

The used methodology obviates the need for exhaustive earthquake re-evaluation, and it is particularly effective for the updating of medium-low events, with a large number of low-intensity data. The result is a new dataset very useful to improve “seismic histories” and to contribute to enhance the seismic hazard of an area. 
 Each Italian earthquake included in the Italian Parametric Catalogue (CPTI) is based on a single study, with its database stored in the Italian Macroseismic Database (DBMI). DBMI collects macroseismic intensity data from approximately 5,000 Italian earthquakes. However, for the same events, numerous studies have been independently carried out over the years in the literature whose data have not been incorporated into the DBMI. By consolidating all available data for each event, it is possible to significantly enhance the dataset used for hazard assessments and the reconstruction of local seismic histories. This approach would make studies of individual events much more robust and comprehensive. The objective of this work is to propose the integration of different macroseismic datasets for individual events by identifying criteria that can effectively merge a large number of intensity data points."

K. Bowring;Jessica Hetzer;Jaime Ribalaygua Batalla;Kirsten Thonicke,Sources of uncertainty in the SPITFIRE global fire  model: development of LPJmL-SPITFIRE1.9  and directions for future improvements,"Under climate change, the conditions necessary for wildfires to form are occurring more frequently in many parts of the world. To help predict how wildfires will change in future, global fire models are being developed. We analyze and further develop one such model, SPITFIRE. Our work identifies and corrects sources of substantial bias in the model that are important to the global fire modelling field. With this analysis and these developments, we help to provide a basis for future improvements. 
 Since its development in 2010, the SPITFIRE global fire model has had a substantial impact on the field of fire modelling using dynamic global vegetation models. It includes process-based representations of fire dynamics, including ignitions, fire spread, and fire effects, resulting in a holistic representation of fire on a global scale. Previously, work had been undertaken to understand the strengths and weaknesses of SPITFIRE and similar models by comparing their outputs against remotely sensed data. We seek to augment this work with new validation methods and extend it by completing a thorough review of the theory underlying the SPITFIRE model to better identify and understand sources of modelling uncertainty. We find several points of improvement in the model, the most impactful being an incorrect implementation of the Rothermel fire spread model that results in large positive biases in fire rate of spread and a live grass moisture parametrization that results in unrealistically dry grasses. The combination of these issues leads to excessively large and intense fires, particularly on the dry modelled grasslands. Because of the tall flames present in these intense fires, which can cause substantial damage to tree crowns, these issues bias SPITFIRE toward high tree mortality. We resolve these issues by correcting the implementation of the Rothermel model and implementing a new live grass moisture parametrization, in addition to several other improvements, including a multi-day fire spread algorithm, and evaluate these changes in the European domain. Our model developments allow SPITFIRE to incorporate more realistic live grass moisture content and result in more accurate burnt area on grasslands and reduced tree mortality. This work provides a crucial improvement to the theoretical basis of the SPITFIRE model and a foundation upon which future model improvements may be built. In addition, this work further supports these model developments by  highlighting areas in the model where high amounts of uncertainty remain, based on new analysis and existing knowledge about the SPITFIRE model, and by identifying potential means of mitigating them to a greater extent."

In this work, we propose a statistical model to describe the most likely background level and the associated uncertainty in a network of dose rate detectors. We train, verify, and validate the model using real environmental data. Using the model, we show that we can correctly predict the background level in a subset of the detector network during a known anomalous event. 
 Detector networks that measure environmental radiation serve as radiological surveillance and early warning networks in many countries across Europe and beyond. Their goal is to detect anomalous radioactive signatures that indicate the release of radionuclides into the environment. Often, the background ambient dose equivalent rate H˙*(10) is predicted using meteorological information. However, in dense detector networks, the correlation between different detectors is expected to contain markedly more information. In this work, we investigate how the joint observations by neighbouring detectors can be leveraged to predict the background H˙*(10). Treating it as a stochastic vector, we show that its distribution can be approximated as multivariate normal. We reframe the question of background prediction as a Bayesian inference problem including priors and likelihood. Finally, we show that the conditional distribution can be used to make predictions. To perform the inferences we use PyMC. All inferences are performed using real data for the nuclear sites in Doel and Mol, Belgium. We validate our calibrated model on previously unseen data. Application of the model to a case with known anomalous behaviour – observations during the operation of Belgian Reactor 1 (BR1) in Mol – highlights the relevance of our method for anomaly detection and quantification."

Focusing on the Baltic Sea region, our model uses weather data as input to predict daily river runoff for 97 rivers. 
 The quality of river runoff determines the quality of regional climate projections for coastal oceans or other estuaries. This study presents a novel approach to river runoff forecasting using convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) networks. Our method accurately predicts daily runoff for 97 rivers within the Baltic Sea catchment by modeling runoff as a spatiotemporal sequence defined by atmospheric forcing. The ConvLSTM model predicts river runoff with an accuracy of ±5 % when compared to the hydrological model.

This makes the tool perfectly suited for geoscientific applications. 
 We have developed an open source ray-tracing tool for space geodetic techniques. The software uses the geometric optics approximation to calculate the signal travel time delay induced by the atmosphere between two given points. The software is written in Fortran and uses OpenMP to speed up computation. The input to the ray-tracing tool are 3D pressure-, temperature- and humidity fields. The Earths magnetic- and electron density field are optional. For the neutral atmosphere (troposphere) the software accepts the NetCDF files from the atmospheric reanalysis ERA5 and the mesoscale model WRF. For the ionosphere the software accepts electron density fields derived from IRI and Ne-quick. We review the current status of the software and test its performance. For example, the one-to-one comparison with the open source software RADIATE shows the high speed and precision of our ray-tracing tool. We also show how our tool can be used to study higher order ionospheric effects (L-band frequencies).

Although N2O consumption activities by diverse heterotrophic N2ORB have been detected, knowledge gaps remain about the phylogenies, physiologies, and activities of N2ORB. Here, we successfully enriched a methylotrophic N2ORB consortium under intermittent oxygen and N2O supplies. 15N tracer analysis showed that the N2O consumption activity of the enriched consortium was higher than its N2O production activity in the presence of either a single or multiple electron acceptors (i.e., nitrogen oxides). The observed maximum N2O consumption was 80.7 μmol·g-biomass–1·h–1. Quantitative PCR results showed that clade I nosZ bacteria overwhelmed clade II nosZ bacteria at high (0.41 mmol·min–1) and low (0.08 mmol·min–1) N2O loading rates. The dilution rate and N2O loading rate affected the microbial community composition and activity. A higher N2O loading rate stimulated active and oxygen-tolerant N2ORB that boosted N2O consumption by approximately 50% in the presence of oxygen. Metagenomic analysis unraveled the predominance of a novel methylotrophic N2ORB, possessing entire denitrifying genes and high-affinity terminal oxidase genes, from the reactor with a high N2O loading rate.

In contrast, excessive oxidative stress (600 ppm of NaClO) reduced bacteria and phage diversity, disrupted antioxidant responses, and increased microbial sensitivity. Hydraulic stress predominantly influenced viral diversity and co-occurrence network topology, favoring the expansion of broad host-range phages and lysogenic lifestyles under combined stresses. Phage–bacterium interaction analyses highlighted phages’ adaptive preferences for hosts with high network centrality and broad ecological niches, which enhanced microbial interactions and resilience. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated the early enrichment of genes associated with energy metabolism, ROS detoxification, and biofilm formation, followed by stabilization as biofilms matured. Phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes were involved in DNA repair, QS, and EPS biosynthesis, contributing to microbial adaptation through oxidative stress resistance and biofilm stabilization. Overall, these findings provide mechanistic insights into biofouling dynamics and highlight the need to optimize chlorine dosing to prevent suboptimal levels of microbial adaptation and biofouling."

We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) best practices and searched SCOPUS, Web of Science, PubMed, and Agricola and further consulted an expert working group to add relevant publications reporting microbial performance of HWT (n = 396 peer-reviewed studies). Reported log10 reduction values (LRVs) varied widely across and within technology categories. We summarize microbial performance by technology type; pathogen class (bacteria, virus, protozoa); and study setting (field or laboratory). Combined coagulation-disinfectant products had the highest LRV performance for bacterial (6.3) and viral (5.3) classes, and porous ceramic had the highest LRV for protozoa (3) when n > 3. Findings can inform the selection of candidate HWT options, but factors such as product design, time burden of use, cost, and long-term maintenance requirements are important considerations in technological performance.

While adult rainbow trout are known to be sensitive, there is limited research on the response of early life stages to 6PPD-Q exposure. Given that early life stages of fish are often more sensitive than adults, the aim of these studies was to assess the acute and subchronic toxicity of 6PPD-Q in early life stage rainbow trout. Rainbow trout alevins were exposed from hatch until 28 days post-hatch to time-weighted average 6PPD-Q concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 2.35 μg/L, which determined a 28-day median lethal dose (LC50) of 0.56 μg/L, as well as morphological deformities, including pooling of blood in the caudal fin. A follow-up acute study with exogenously feeding rainbow trout fry revealed a 96-h LC50 of 0.47 μg/L. These studies indicate that early life stage rainbow trout are sensitive to subchronic 6PPD-Q exposure, and underscore the importance of utilizing early life stage studies to determine the most sensitive benchmark concentrations, and their value in determining sublethal effects."

Although much effort has been made on organic chloramines in chlorination, great discrepancies exist in occurrence, decomposition kinetics, and molecular-level mechanisms of N-chloroaldimines. Herein, we propose a high-throughput method integrating directional reduction to distinguish organic chloramines from the nontarget-analyzed CHNOCl compounds and identify 86.6% of the CHNOCl compounds as N,N-dichloramines, N-monochloramines, and N-chloroaldimines. N,N-dichloramines show higher instability than N-monochloramines and can decompose to N-chloroaldimines. Furthermore, we quantitatively demonstrate the slower decomposition of N-chloroaldimines (10–6 s–1) than N,N-dichloramines (10–5 s–1) with 1 order of magnitude, and both of them are sensitive to engineering conditions, e.g., pH and residual disinfectants. We find that residual disinfectants can accelerate the decomposition of N-chloroaldimines. Meanwhile, we unravel the significant roles of NH2-linked R groups on the decomposition pathways of N-chloroaldimines through experimental and theoretical perspectives. Alkyl chains linked to NH2 groups lead to only the formation of nitriles in N-chloroaldimine decomposition, whereas carbocycles or benzene rings could result in the formation of aldehydes. These key insights will enable the effective control of N-chloroaldimine-derived disinfection byproducts and future optimization of the disinfection process."

To meet this demand, the raw materials sector must increase current capacities and develop new capacities at untapped deposits. Understanding life cycle impacts is crucial to avoid severe environmental burden shifts in the future. Although site-specific life cycle inventories exist, they do not allow for a comprehensive global assessment of the Li sector, particularly in capturing technological developments. To address this, our study presents a life cycle inventory model for brines that maintains essential site-specific parameters while providing a global perspective. We define core parameters for site-specific modeling of Li carbonate (Li2CO3) production and develop a systematic approach to addressing data gaps. Our model employs a class-based structure for 30 mapped processes from the literature and quantifies environmental and technical flows. Overall, we cover 25 sites, representing 300 kilotonnes (90%) of current Li2CO3 production from brines and an additional 315 kilotonnes of potential future production. One key finding is that sites using direct Li extraction have 7-fold higher climate change impacts than sites using conventional technologies on average, while water scarcity impacts are doubled on average. The difference is a result of the larger brine mass required to be treated due to lower Li grades. Furthermore, our model allows the implications for Li-ion battery production to be analyzed."

Germicidal UV-C irradiation effectively inactivates spores suspended in water, yet information on surface spore mitigation is surprisingly absent. We show the effectiveness of 265–275 nm UV-C light to mitigateAspergillus nigeron nutrient-rich surfaces. UV-C mitigation of surface molds differs from inactivating spores suspended in water due to the unique characteristics of mycelial structures. Complete preinactivation of all viable cells during UV-C exposure is crucial to prevent mycelia formation; otherwise, even a single spore can gradually spread, covering surfaces by producing a progressive mycelial structure. A UV-C dose of 144 mJ/cm2 from 265 nm LEDs achieved complete preinactivation at lower concentrations (100–1000 CFU/plate), while higher concentrations required increased UV-C doses. Intermittent duty cycling of light delivery (10 min ON then 50 min OFF) at 275 nm delivered from side-emitting optical fibers achieved comparable mitigation to continuous irradiation. Insufficient UV-C exposure induced more resistant mycelial structures that shielded live spores beneath. This study highlights complete preinactivation of viable molds, or sustained inhibition by UV-C light, is more effective than UV-C posttreatment.

This study investigated the impact of wildfire smoke on the IAQ across 24 campus buildings in Alberta, Canada, representing public spaces with varied ventilation systems. Using a network of low-cost sensors to monitor indoor PM2.5, the study identified significant spikes during wildfire smoke events, with 71% of buildings exceeding the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards daily limit of 27 μg/m3. The buildings had mechanical ventilation systems with filters with different Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) ratings. MERV13 filters were found to be more efficient at capturing PM2.5 particles, resulting in lower indoor/outdoor PM2.5 ratios (0.12 ± 0.07) compared to MERV8 filters (0.28 ± 0.14). Buildings with air change rates (ACH) ranging from 5 to 15 per hour exhibited different infiltration patterns, with higher ACH generally leading to elevated indoor PM2.5 concentrations during wildfire events. This highlights the need to balance ventilation and pollutant infiltration by optimizing ACH rates and filtration efficiency to reduce indoor PM2.5. The trajectory-fire interception method, combined with satellite data, enhanced the identification of wildfire-influenced periods, contributing to a better understanding of smoke infiltration dynamics. These findings underscore that even advanced filtration and ventilation systems alone may not ensure a healthy IAQ during extreme pollution. Real-time pollutant measurements are crucial for effective IAQ management. The findings  offer valuable insights for building administrators and policymakers, helping them develop strategies to mitigate the effects of wildfire smoke and to support healthier indoor environments during wildfire seasons."

Here, we present the first OHC record for the last four deglaciations using noble‐gas ratios in the EPICA Dome C ice core. The record reveals millennial‐scale OHC variability in all studied deglaciations, most prominently as OHC maxima at the end of Terminations II, III, and IV. These millennial‐scale OHC changes are anti‐correlated with AMOC strength, suggesting that the AMOC modulates OHC across different climate states.

These low resistivity zones likely formed due to Archean mineral bearing fluid migration from underlying fertile source zones to downstream (shallower) crustal reservoirs and, ultimately, near surface traps.

During the FIREX‐AQ field mission, we measured the optical and microphysical properties of smoke plumes that had been emitted between 0.5 and 8.5 hr earlier. We find that the measured g can only be reproduced from particle size distribution measurements using a higher refractive index than is typically retrieved from remote measurements and assumed in some models.

Using a simple radiative transfer equation, we show that the instantaneous aerosol cooling of the planet by fresh smoke is increased by 20% when evaluated using the measured g values instead of assuming n = 1.52. Besides improving model representations of radiative cooling by fresh smoke, using a more accurate aerosol optical model can improve retrievals of aerosol microphysical properties from remote sensing techniques.

Interactions among motions of different scales complicate its structural evolution, making prediction challenging. This study focuses on two typical processes in the SBL: low‐level jet (LLJ) and internal gravity waves (IGWs), investigating how their interactions influence the evolution of turbulence structures. Utilizing a full boundary layer turbulence observation network and data processing system at Zhongchuan International Airport, this study includes eddy covariance system, Doppler Lidar, and wind profiling radar. In strongly SBL, turbulence energy accumulates in higher layers and, during downward transfer, generates local LLJ and IGWs, triggering intermittent turbulence events. Internal factors of turbulence intermittency dominated the process. The interaction between LLJ and IGWs maintains intermittent turbulence bursts, accompanied by the conversion of sub‐mesoscale energy to turbulent energy. In weakly SBL, the conversion of sub‐mesoscale motion energy drives intermittent turbulence events, along with energy transfers between different scales of IGWs, resulting in weaker turbulence intermittency. External factors of turbulence intermittency dominated the process. In both cases, the interaction between LLJ and IGWs alters turbulence structure and atmospheric stability. Turbulent mixing changes the mean gradient field, further influencing the LLJ height. This study elucidates the mechanisms of interaction between internal and external factors in turbulence intermittency. It outlines energy transfer among different scales of motion and clarifies the mechanisms behind state transitions and structural evolution in strongly and weakly SBL. These findings are significant for advancing theoretical research and simulation developments of the SBL."

However, different entrainment‐mixing scenarios can occur in real clouds. To address this deficiency, a unifying parameterization that represents different entrainment‐mixing processes is implemented and evaluated in CESM1.2. The results indicate that the homogeneous mixing degree values simulated by the new parameterization in CESM1.2 are predominantly greater than 50%, suggesting a tendency toward homogeneous mixing. Compared to the extremely inhomogeneous mixing mechanism, the new parameterization increases the cloud droplet number concentration (Nc). More importantly, the new parameterization improves low‐cloud fraction (CLDLOW) simulation in Northwest Pacific (NWP) and Southeast Pacific (SEP) regions, with relative improvements of 2.95% and 4.17%, respectively. Furthermore, the improvements reach up to 44.6% and 16.2% in the NWP and SEP regions, respectively, when considering the relationship between Nc and CLDLOW. Further analysis reveals that the new parameterization enhances cloud optical depth, longwave radiative cooling effect, net condensation rate, cloud water mixing ratio, lower‐troposphere stability, and CLDLOW by increasing Nc.

 Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent, bioaccumulative and anthropogenic pollutants that have attracted the attention of the public and private sectors because of their adverse impact on human health1. Although various technologies have been deployed to degrade PFASs with a focus on non-polymeric functionalized compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid)2–4, a general PFAS destruction method coupled with fluorine recovery for upcycling is highly desirable. Here we disclose a protocol that converts multiple classes of PFAS, including the fluoroplastics polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride, into high-value fluorochemicals. To achieve this, PFASs were reacted with potassium phosphate salts under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions, a mineralization process enabling fluorine recovery as KF and K2PO3F for fluorination chemistry. The phosphate salts can be recovered for reuse, implying no detrimental impact on the phosphorus cycle. Therefore, PFASs are not only destructible but can now contribute to a sustainable circular fluorine economy.

 One of the main interpretations of deep-rooted geophysical structures in the mantle1 is that they stem from the top-down solidification of the primitive basal magma ocean of Earth above the core2–6. However, it remains debated whether solids first formed at the bottom of the mantle, solidifying upward, or above the melts, solidifying downward. Here we show that gravitational segregation of dense, iron-rich melts from lighter, iron-poor solids drives mantle evolution, regardless of where melting curves and geotherms intersect. This process results in the accumulation of iron-oxide-rich melts above the core, forming a basal magma ocean. We numerically model mantle solidification using a new multiphase fluid dynamics approach that integrates melting phase relations and geochemical models. This enables estimating the compositional signature and spatial distribution of primordial geochemical reservoirs, which may be directly linked to the isotopic anomalies measured in Archean rocks7–11. We find that a substantial amount of solids is produced at the surface of the planet, not at depth, injecting geochemical signatures of shallow silicate fractionation in the deep mantle. This work could serve as a foundation for re-examining the intricate interplay between mantle dynamics, petrology and geochemistry during the first thousand million years of the evolution of rocky planets.

 Diesel vehicles are an important emission source of intermediate-volatility and semi-volatile organic compounds (I/SVOCs). Previous studies rarely reported the impacts of loading mass on diesel I/SVOC emissions. Here, we applied a non-targeted screening characterization method to characterize detailed I/SVOC emissions of two diesel trucks by using a two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-ToF-MS), and explored the impact from various loading mass conditions. The results indicated that higher loading mass could reduce total I/SVOC emissions of tested trucks, which was consistent with the trend in organic carbon (OC) but opposite to that of elemental carbon (EC). The chemical composition was also affected by loading mass. Saturated hydrocarbon compounds tend to account for a higher fraction of the total I/SVOCs under empty loading mass conditions, which were probably emitted due to incomplete combustion, compared with the chemical composition of diesel fuels. The fractions of unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) increased with higher loading mass, suggesting that thermal decomposition and oxidation processes become more important. Furthermore, we mapped the I/SVOCs into the two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) according to loading mass conditions, which served as the input profiles for further atmospheric modeling of secondary organic aerosol (SOA)."

 Under the context of climate change, the climatic conditions for maize during different growth stages in Northeast China (NEC) exert a markedly varying influence on the final yield. We define nine Climate-Year Types (CYTs) based on the probability density functions of temperature and precipitation, aiming to explore the underlying drivers of climatic factors contributing to yield shocks. By incorporating a panel regression model, we quantitatively analyze the key compound climate conditions that influence maize yield across different growth stages. The results indicate that the main CYTs are biased towards drier conditions (Cold-Dry, Rainless, Warm-Dry) from 1992 to 2021, while the probability of warmer conditions (Normal-Warm, Warm-Wet, Warm-Dry) is expected to increase throughout the whole growth stage in the future. The overall yield shock is approximately 20 % in the historical period, with projected exacerbation under the future warming scenarios. At present, the dominant CYTs that determines the final yield of maize is changing from colder and wetter conditions in the growing stage to drier and warmer conditions in the reproductive stage. Moreover, the Warm-Dry CYT emerges as the most significant climatic factor influencing maize yield, with each occurrence associated with a 3.70 % decrease in yield throughout the whole growth stage in the historical period. Notably, the frequency of Warm-Dry CYT is expected to increase in most cities of NEC, which remains a major contributor to yield shocks, with the magnitude of its impact likely to intensify in the future. In summary, these studies identify the key climate types affecting maize yield at different growth stages in NEC, emphasizing the impact of compound heat and drought. This will provide a scientific basis for targeted measures to enhance yield and mitigate risks."

 Much of the Earth's surface lacks long-term in-situ measurement of essential meteorological variables. Climate reanalysis datasets provide an alternative in data-sparse regions, sometimes replacing gauge-based observations for climatological studies, however, they have inherent biases. Reanalysis is now available at finer spatial and temporal resolutions, that can be considered for hydrological and climatological studies. Although the assessment of reanalysis datasets is common at a daily, monthly, or seasonal scale, how the recent generation reanalysis captures the spatial pattern of extreme temperature events, and their trends remains an open question.In this study, two regional (IMDAA and EARS) and five global (ERA5-Land, ERA5, MERRA2, CFSR, and JRA3Q) reanalysis datasets are evaluated with a gauge-based gridded temperature dataset from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to assess their suitability for studying extreme temperature events and their trends over India. Fifteen hot and cold extremes indices are identified to characterize extremes covering frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme temperature events.The study finds that no single reanalysis outperforms others for all the extreme indices when compared to the IMD gridded data, however, a select few (e.g., ERA5, ERA5L, MERRA2, and JRA3Q) better perform in reproducing the observed spatial pattern of extreme events and their changes across different regions of India. It is also noted that in response to global warming, the frequency, duration, and magnitude of extreme hot events are rising, and cold events are decreasing in India which is also captured by most of these reanalyses. Overall, the increase in hot extremes is more prominent in the south of the tropics and the decline in cold extremes is more evident in the north. However, the trend areas and magnitudes of the reanalysis datasets were not similar in comparison to trends from a regional station-based gridded dataset.

 This study attempts to correct the attenuation of the radar reflectivity factor from two X-band radars in Cyprus, using a constrained attenuation correction method. This research was implemented under the assumption that the difference between the reflectivity measured by each of the ground radars, on the one hand, and the reflectivity measured by the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, on the other hand, equals the path integrated attenuation (PIA). This is because solely the reflectivity data at horizontal polarization have been used so far. Various parameter combinations of linear coefficients for the constrained correction were tested empirically, using GPM DPR data as a reference. The results showed that no single parameter combination can be consistently effective, and highlighted the need for event- and radar-specific attenuation correction."

We identified several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria andStreptomyces. Although these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, substantially influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes."

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) soil moisture (SM) product reveals a sharp depletion during the early 21st century. During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland’s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002–2006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift (~45 centimeters).

Within a clinically important pathway regulating redox and metabolic homeostasis (NRF2/KEAP1), we discovered an ancient mutation—conserved in all extant equids—that increases mitochondrial respiration while decreasing tissue-damaging oxidative stress. This mutation is a de novo premature opal stop codon in KEAP1 that is translationally recoded into a cysteine through previously unknown mechanisms, producing an R15C mutation in KEAP1 that is more sensitive to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. This recoding enables increased NRF2 activity, which enhances mitochondrial adenosine 5′-triphosphate production and cellular resistance to oxidative damage. Our study illustrates how recoding of a de novo stop codon, a strategy thought restricted to viruses, can facilitate adaptation in vertebrates."

However, neural control of palatable food intake is poorly understood. We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by a neural pathway from the peri–locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTADA) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTADAneuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTADAneuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTADAneuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTADAneurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide."
