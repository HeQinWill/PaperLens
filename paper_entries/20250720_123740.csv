This study employed a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to investigate the potential risks, mechanisms of associated cellular processes, and biological reactions to preformed protein-MPs coronation and intact MPs using brain-derived neuronal and glial cells. Our findings indicate that MPs can adsorb proteins and form a heterogeneous corona layer when interacting with biological fluids such as serum. Proteomics analysis revealed that protein–MP coronation notably alters protein expression levels compared to intact MPs, impacting core cellular biological processes, including protein synthesis machinery and RNA processing pathways, lipid metabolism, and nuclear–cytoplasmic compartmentalization and transport. Notably, the heterogeneous protein adsorption onto MP surfaces perturbs a wide range of cellular signaling pathways through cellular recognition mechanisms, potentially contributing to the challenge of MP accumulation in the brain."

Sadik;Baohua Gu;Xujun Liang;Lijie Zhang,Dark Reduction of Hg(II) by Dissolved Organic Matter Derived from Aging Microplastics: Mechanisms and Implications,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a critical role in the environmental cycling and transformation of mercury (Hg), primarily due to its strong reducing and complexing properties toward mercuric Hg(II). Microplastics-derived DOM (MPs-DOM), particularly that released during photoaging, represents an emerging source of DOM in aquatic environments. However, its capacity to mediate Hg(II) transformation remains largely unexplored. This study investigated dark reduction of Hg(II) by DOM released from aging polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and polylactic acid under simulated environmental conditions. The results show that, under dark conditions, DOM from photoaged MPs suspensions reduced over 30% of Hg(II) within 10 min, whereas DOM from dark-aged MPs suspensions exhibited negligible Hg(II) reduction activity. Further analyses showed that photoaging enhanced the electron-donating capacity of MPs-DOM by increasing phenol-like compounds, which promoted Hg(II) reduction via electron transfer through phenolic hydroxyl groups. Notably, MPs-DOM released during photoaging outperformed the Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) in reducing Hg(II), likely due to compositional differences in Hg(II)-complexing functional groups. When mixed together, elevated concentrations of MPs-DOM dominated over SRNOM, favoring Hg(II) reduction as the primary pathway. Given the growing prevalence of MPs-DOM in aquatic ecosystems and the persistence of dark reactions in light-limited environments, this study underscores the significant role of MPs-DOM in promoting dark Hg(II) reduction, highlighting a previously underrecognized pathway affecting Hg cycling."

Although advancements in separation performance have been frequently reported, significant challenges in evaluating mixed-salt IEM performance under electro-driven conditions remain largely overlooked. Here, we present a new method for the rapid and standardized characterization of ion transport properties for IEMs in mixed-salt systems. Using a modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, we demonstrate that individual ion permeability can be obtained from IEM conductance measurements with mixed-salt linear sweep voltammetry experiments. Under low-current conditions, the ion permeability ratio can be converted into different metrics for quantification of ion–ion selectivity including current-based and flux-based selectivity. Our findings also reveal substantial differences between ion transport properties of IEMs under single-salt and mixed-salt conditions, highlighting the critical role of competing ions in transport experiments. Overall, this new approach provides an efficient framework to evaluate IEM performance in environmentally relevant conditions, facilitating cross-membrane performance comparison and establishing the foundation to elucidate the structure-property-performance relationships for IEMs in mixed-salt systems."

This study investigated the concentrations, emission rates, and particle size distributions of ARGs in air around a dairy farm and swine farm, as well as in farm wastewater and soil as potential sources, during a yearlong sampling campaign. Analysis targeted genes corresponding to a cross-section of antibiotic classes used in human and veterinary medicine, along with 16S rRNA and intI1 as indicators of total bacterial load and anthropogenic sources of ARGs, respectively. Two approaches were demonstrated for estimating emissions to account for the physical configurations of the farms. A custom sampler that collected size-resolved aerosol particles at a flow rate of 2.25 L/min only when the wind originated from the direction of interest was used to collect aerosol particles near potential sources. At the dairy and swine farms, blaCTX-M1 concentrations varied significantly by sampling location, averaging 102 gene copies per cubic meter (gc m–3) across seasons and peaking at 104 gc m–3 during the summer sampling period. At the swine farm, maximum concentrations reached 105 gc m–3 for intI1, ermF, and qnrA near the buildings’ exhaust fans. Emission rates reached ∼ 105 gc s–1 for some ARGs, including blaCTX-M1, and 106 gc s–1 for intI1. ARGs were predominantly associated with coarse particles (>5 μm) near emission sources and were also present in fine (<1 μm) and accumulation (1–5 μm) mode particles near the source and at downwind locations, indicating potential for inhalation exposure and long-range transport."

Fowler,Impact of the Western Tibetan Vortex on Springtime Snow Cover Over the Western Tibetan Plateau,"Snow cover changes are of great importance to the hydrological cycle of the western Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, the influence of the atmospheric circulation on snow cover over the western TP is still unclear. This study finds that springtime snow cover variability over the western TP tail is significantly modulated by the Western Tibetan Vortex (WTV), which explains up to 40% variance. Cyclonic (anticyclonic) WTV variability generally causes water vapor convergence (divergence) and ascending (sinking) motions over the western TP tail, which thereby leads to more (less) snowfall and snow cover about one day later. Horizontal water vapor transport at the southern boundary of the western TP tail from the tropical Indian Ocean is key for the influence of the WTV. This study elucidates the impact of the WTV on springtime snow cover, which augments our understanding of the hydrological cycle over the western TP."

Here we investigate the phase transition of (Al, H)‐bearing stishovite with four compositions at simultaneously high P‐T conditions combining Raman spectroscopy and X‐ray diffraction. These experimental results reveal that the incorporation of 0.01 a.p.f.u Al into stishovite with H/Al ratio of ∼1/3 lowers the transition pressure by 6.7(3) GPa. However, the Clapeyron slope of this transition is nearly unaffected by changes in the Al content and has a value of 12.2–12.5(3) MPa/K. According to our results, Al content variation ranging from 0 to 0.07 a.p.f.u in SiO2 can reasonably explain the depth distribution from 800 to 1,900 km of the seismic scatterers observed in the circum‐Pacific region.

Here, oxygenation change in the upper deep western North Pacific between 5.3 and 1.0 million years ago (Ma) is reconstructed using multiple organic and inorganic proxies from the South China Sea. Results show higher oxygenation during the middle Pliocene, followed by continuous deoxygenation from 3.6 to 2.0 Ma. This deoxygenation, suggesting increased carbon sequestration and thus promoting CO2 decline, coincides with an expansion of oxygen‐deficient Pacific deep water in the western North pacific, which could be due to progressive tectonic deformation of the northwestern Pacific basin.

Barnes,Reanalysis‐Based Global Radiative Response to Sea Surface Temperature Patterns: Evaluating the Ai2 Climate Emulator,"The sensitivity of the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere to surface temperature perturbations cannot be directly observed. The relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and top‐of‐atmosphere radiation can be estimated with Green's function (GF) simulations by locally perturbing the sea surface temperature boundary conditions in atmospheric climate models. We perform such simulations with the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE), a machine learning‐based emulator trained on ERA5 reanalysis data (ACE2‐ERA5). This produces a sensitivity map of the top‐of‐atmosphere radiative response to surface warming that aligns with our physical understanding of radiative feedbacks. However, ACE2‐ERA5 likely underestimates the radiative response to historical warming. We compare to two additional versions of ACE and traditional climate models. We argue that GF experiments can be used to evaluate the performance and limitations of machine learning‐based climate emulators by examining if causal physical relationships are correctly represented and testing their capability for out‐of‐distribution predictions."

However, the mechanisms that influence the decadal change of the SAH remain unclear. Results based on reanalysis data and climate model experiments indicate that with increased emission of anthropogenic aerosols (AAs), the contribution of external forcing to the SAH strengthened in the late 1960s and exceeded its internal variability. The transition of the Interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) from the cold to the warm phase and increased AAs jointly promoted decadal decline in the SAH in the late 1970s through air‐sea processes and radiation effects, respectively. Notably, the transition of the IPO from the positive to the negative phase around 2000 tended to enhance the SAH. However, this was offset by the larger contribution from high emission of AAs, which promoted a continuously weak SAH. The contribution of AAs might still dominate the SAH changes at the beginning of this century. However, as the emission of AAs declines in the future, the influence of AAs on the SAH might weaken. The IPO is expected to play the dominant role in the decadal variation of the SAH from the 2040s under the low‐emission Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP1‐2.6)."

Rendon;Y. Zhang,Impact of Microphysical Parameterizations on Satellite All‐Sky Infrared Data Assimilation and Practical Predictability of Hurricane Harvey (2017),"Satellites provide the majority of observations of tropical cyclones (TCs) when they are over the open ocean. These observations are under‐utilized in operational global and regional forecasting models as most of the cloudy and precipitation‐affected observations are discarded. Recent works have shown that assimilating all‐sky infrared (IR) radiances from geostationary satellites improves TC track, intensity, and rainfall forecasts. This study examines how two different cloud microphysical parametrization schemes impact all‐sky IR radiance assimilation and subsequent forecasts of Hurricane Harvey. Because model hydrometeor fields that are used to simulate IR radiances are strongly constrained by the model microphysics scheme, Harvey's dynamic and thermodynamic structure become very different when changing the microphysics schemes, which also leads to changes in subsequent intensity forecasts. Sensitivity forecasts suggest that intensity forecast errors in this study are primarily controlled by uncertainties in initial conditions, which are influenced by microphysics schemes as they simulate model priors differently when assimilating all‐sky IR radiance. On the other hand, the microphysics schemes used during the free forecasts generally have a smaller impact on Harvey's intensity forecast errors."

To quantify the aerosol effects on OMB, we utilized the Modern‐Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA‐2) data to calculate the mass densities of different aerosol types (dust, organics, sulfates, and carbonates). These parameters are then incorporated into the advanced radiative transfer modeling system (ARMS) to simulate the brightness temperatures (BT) and Jacobians for the longwave channels of the FengYun‐4B (FY‐4B)/GIIRS. For a sandstorm event on 9 April 2023, simulation results indicate a positive correlation between OMB and aerosol optical parameters (e.g., aerosol mass density, particle size, and aerosol optical depth). The inclusion of aerosols generally results in smaller OMBs. In particular, the bias in GIIRS is reduced by 1.11 K when the dust aerosols are included. In general, both JT and JQ are sensitive to the changes in dust aerosol. Simulated BT sensitivity is most responsive to the temperature of aerosol and particulate layers. Moreover, accounting for the effects of dust aerosols in the one‐dimensional variational retrieval (1D‐VAR) system significantly enhanced the accuracy of temperature profile retrievals in dust‐affected regions. Compared to retrievals that did not consider aerosol effects and the GIIRS Level‐2 product, the temperature retrieval results were improved, especially in aerosol peak layers. The root mean square error (RMSE) improved by about 0.01 K, and the mean bias improved by about 0.7 K."

Because of the small scale of these storms and the complexity of the involved processes, observing and modeling convective storms is challenging. The potential of online diagnostics in convection‐permitting models to simulate hail and lightning, especially over climatic time scales and extended regions, has not yet been fully exploited. To address this gap, we present a European‐wide hail and lightning climatology (2011–2021) using the Consortium for Small Scale Modeling (COSMO) regional climate model with a horizontal grid spacing of 2.2 km, coupled with a hail growth model (HAILCAST) and the lightning potential index (LPI) diagnostics. We further developed a new European‐wide hail product based on the Operational Program for the Exchange of Weather Radar Information (OPERA) composite. Model validation against observations demonstrates an overall good performance in simulating hail and lightning on spatial, seasonal, and diurnal scales. The highest hail frequencies occur during summer along the slopes of high mountain ridges, such as the Alps, Pyrenees, and the Carpathians, aligning with observed lightning hotspots in Europe. In autumn, hail and lightning occur predominantly over the Mediterranean and along the Adriatic coast. Severe hail events with a maximum hail diameter larger than 20 mm mainly occur in the Po Valley, western Spain, and Eastern Europe. This 11‐year simulation provides a European‐wide data set of severe convective storms and their properties, serving as a basis for further studies of convective events and their impacts."

Once water supplies have been fully allocated and developing new water supplies is infeasible, the best option to meet growing water demands is often to reallocate water from rural agricultural water uses. Yet, the dynamics and implications of these rural‐to‐urban water transfers are poorly understood. Here, we integrate an agent‐based model with an input‐output model to capture the behavior of individual irrigators and examine how their water transfer decisions propagate through the broader rural economy and shape social dynamics. As a demonstration of our model, the rural community represents Alamosa County while the city represents the city of Denver, both located in Colorado, Unites States. We find that the greatest long‐term decline in crop water use corresponds with higher city growth rates while the greatest short‐term decline corresponds with larger farmer discount rates. As farmers sell their water rights to the City, economic activity from the crop production sector declines, causing unemployment in the crop production sector to increase and demand from the service sectors to decrease, which results in output declining in these economic sectors as well. Thus, a negative impact on the agricultural sector will cause some negative impact on other economic sectors, such as professional, health care, and recreational services. This research brings new insights that can be used to evaluate the socio‐economic impacts of water transfers and shape policy to minimize potential negative externalities associated with water transfers."

 Nucleotide-containing metabolites, e.g., NAD, can serve as noncanonical initiating nucleotides (NCIN) during transcription, yielding NCIN-capped RNAs (NCIN-RNAs). Current profiling strategies are limited to detecting specific metabolite caps and lack an epitranscriptome-wide approach for quantifying the ratio between NCIN- and m7G-capped forms. Here, we develop the CompasSeq analytical platform, which integrates experimental and computational frameworks, enabling comprehensive and quantitative assessment of NCIN-RNAs at the transcript resolution. CompasSeq utilizes carefully devised enzymatic reactions to selectively capture NCIN-RNAs. By introducing proper spike-ins, CompasSeq can analyze the stoichiometry of NCIN caps. We further design an orthogonal method, the quantitative exoribonuclease reduction assay, to validate newly identified NCIN-RNAs and their capping ratios. Using CompasSeq, we quantify previously unexplored NCIN capping percentages from mouse liver and illustrate their age-associated dynamics. Moreover, we uncover a dichotomy between RNA expression and NCIN capping in genes impinging on age-related pathways. Our study presents both experimental and computational solutions for in-depth analysis of NCIN-RNAs, paving the road for functional investigations into NCIN-RNAs.

Here, the authors show quantitatively, how ion-water friction regulates diffusion and electromigration of ions in nanochannels. 
 Quantitative understanding of ion transport mechanism is crucial for numerous applications of two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels, but is far from being resolved. Here, we formulated a theoretical framework for both self-diffusion and electromigration of hydrated monatomic ions in various 2D nanochannels (e.g. graphene, h-BN, g-C3N4, MoS2), by molecular dynamics simulations. The self-diffusivity and mobility of ions in 2D nanochannels both increases linearly with ion-wall distance for small hydrated ions, yet keeps constant for large ones. The underlying mechanism reveals that when ions approach water-layers in nanochannels or possess large hydration shell, their hydration shells become severely distorted. This increases the free energy difference between hydration shell and the surrounding water-layers, water residence time in hydration shell and ion-water friction. Several involving quantitative relations were revealed, with Nernst–Einstein relation validated with both simulations and theoretical derivation. This work shows profound implications for various applications, including ion-sieving, nanodevices and nano-power generators, etc. Ion transport mechanism is crucial for various applications of two-dimensional nanochannels.

Here, the authors report an experimental study of such instabilities in the coupled dynamics of rocket plumes and sand surfaces. 
 From the crewed Apollo missions to the recent Chinese Chang’e landings, the interaction between spacecraft exhaust plumes and lunar soil produces dusty clouds with high-speed particle ejection. Despite varying landing sites, remarkably stable streak patterns were observed, raising questions about their origin. We solved this puzzle by showing that these patterns were driven by Görtler instability from the curved compressed shear layer of the supersonic but surprisingly laminar jet. This instability creates vortical structures that entrain and eject particles. The number of streaks exhibits an interesting scaling with the jet pressure ratio, which can be modeled with linear instability theory and shows excellent agreement with scaled-down experiments, simulations, and actual observations in landing videos. Our findings provide a fluid physics explanation of extraterrestrial landings, highlighting the role of particle-laden flows and paving the way for future missions to optimize landing strategies and mitigate dust cloud effects on equipment and visibility.

 Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs), the periplasmic metalloenzymes in Gram-negative methylotrophic bacteria, play a pivotal role in methane and methanol bio-utilization. Although the structures of many PQQ-dependent MDHs have been resolved, including the canonical heterotetrameric enzymes composed of two MxaF and two MxaI subunits with a molecule of PQQ and a calcium ion in the active site in MxaF, the biogenesis of these enzymes remains elusive. Here, we characterize a chaperone, MxaJ, responsible for PQQ incorporation by reconstructing a PQQ-dependent MDH assembly system in Escherichia coli. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we capture the structures of the intermediate complexes formed by the chaperone MxaJ and catalytic subunit MxaF during PQQ-dependent MDH maturation, revealing a chaperone-mediated molecular mechanism of cofactor incorporation.

 Deubiquitinating modification of proteins is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. Here, we investigated the role and regulating mechanism of a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), ovarian tumor domain-containing protein 1 (OTUD1), in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). We find a significantly increased OTUD1 expression in diabetic mouse hearts, and single-cell RNA sequencing shows OTUD1 mainly distributing in cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific OTUD1 knockout prevents cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in both type 2 and type 1 diabetic male mice. OTUD1 deficiency restores cardiac AMPK activity and mitochondrial function in diabetic hearts and cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, OTUD1 binds to AMPKα2 subunit, deubiquitinates AMPKα2 at K60/K379 sites, and then inhibits AMPKT172 phosphorylation through impeding the interaction of AMPKα2 and its upstream kinase CAMKK2. Finally, silencing AMPKα2 in cardiomyocytes abolishes the cardioprotective effects of OTUD1 deficiency in diabetic mice. In conclusion, this work identifies a direct regulatory DUB of AMPK and presents a OTUD1-AMPK axis in cardiomyocytes for driving DCM.

 Forecasting super El Niño remains challenging, partly due to poor representation of westerly wind bursts (WWBs). We developed an artificial intelligence-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to skillfully parameterize WWBs, capturing their joint modulation by oceanic and atmospheric processes. The DDPM-based scheme effectively captures observed WWBs’ characteristics (e.g., frequency, intensity, and spatial center). When implemented in the Community Earth System Model, it outperforms both the control (CTRL, without WWBs parameterization) and conventional warm pool eastern edge (WPEE)-dependent parameterization in predicting intensity and seasonal phase-locking for super El Niños (1982/83, 1997/98, 2015/16). This improvement stems from DDPM’s realistic WWBs representation, correcting CTRL and WPEE’s biases of overly weak and westward-shifted winds during El Niño growth. Consequently, DDPM produces more realistic eastern Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly warming patterns. These findings underscore WWB's accuracy as key to super El Niño prediction and demonstrate machine learning’s potential for WWB's parameterization."

 The impacts of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the North Atlantic and European sector (NAE) climate are season-dependent and, in some cases, not linear and/or not stationary. Previous studies have found multidecadal variability in ENSO teleconnections to NAE in certain seasons, relating it to changes in the background state. However, the stationarity of the teleconnection and its surface impacts in Europe during early winter remain largely unexplored, a gap intended to be addressed in this study. The observational analysis reveals changes in the teleconnection impacts and mechanisms over recent decades. These changes have strong implications for the assessment of seasonal predictability, hence the performance of the SEAS5 seasonal prediction model is analysed. While SEAS5 does not accurately capture the observed non-stationarity, it displays pronounced multidecadal changes in forecast skill. This implies the emergence of windows of opportunity for seasonal forecasting, where predictability may be higher than initially expected."

 The history of resilience of organisms over geologic timescales serves as a reference for predicting their response to future conditions. Here we use fossil Porites coral records of skeletal growth and environmental variability from the subtropical Central Paratethys Sea to assess coral resilience to past ocean warming and acidification. These records offer a unique perspective on the calcification performance and environmental tolerances of a major present-day reef builder during the globally warm mid-Miocene CO2 maximum and subsequent climate transition (16 to 13 Ma). We found evidence for up-regulation of the pH and saturation state of the corals’ calcifying fluid as a mechanism underlying past resilience. However, this physiological control on the internal carbonate chemistry was insufficient to counteract the sub-optimal environment, resulting in an extremely low calcification rate that likely affected reef framework accretion. Our findings emphasize the influence of latitudinal seasonality on the sensitivity of coral calcification to climate change.

 Sorption to mineral surfaces is widely regarded as the dominant mechanism of organic matter (OM) preservation, yet it cannot fully explain the varying fates of terrestrially-derived OM during its transport from land to ocean. To investigate this question, here we performed microscale analyses of OM-mineral associations in the clay-sized fraction, a critical carrier for long-term carbon burial and terrestrial OM transport. Across diverse OM sources and mineral compositions, we identify a consistent chemical–spatial coupling: nitrogen-rich OM is closely associated with iron-rich mineral surfaces, while carbon-rich OM is primarily protected within aggregate pores. This coupling suggests that minerals stabilise different OM types through distinct mechanisms, potentially explaining their contrasting responses to environmental changes during transport from land to ocean. Our results challenge the prevailing focus on surface sorption alone and underscore the importance of microscale OM–mineral organisation in controlling the fates of terrestrial OM across Earth’s land–ocean interface.

 In the context of global urbanization, urban expansion significantly affects urban thermal environment. As a key indicator of urbanization, impervious surfaces are widely used to monitor urban growth. However, most existing studies examining thermal environments through impervious surfaces are limited to pixel-scale. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of urban land cover, pixel-scale analyses often fail to accurately capture the thermal effects of impervious surfaces. To address this issue, we propose a universal impervious surface percentage (UISP) model based on Landsat imagery for subpixel-scale impervious surfaces monitoring. We evaluated the relationship between impervious surface percentage (ISP) and surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in four representative Chinese cities—Beijing, Kunming, Shenzhen, and Wuhan—from 2018 to 2023. Results indicate that UISP significantly improves the accuracy of impervious surface estimation over heterogeneous urban landscapes. The deviations of estimated ISP are as much as 0.2 lower than pixel-scale results. In SUHI areas, ISP values exceeded 0.4 to 0.6 higher than in non-SUHI regions. The ISP difference between SUHI levels 1 and 2 was 0.12, and between levels 5 and 6, it was 0.08, suggesting ISP saturation in high SUHI zones.

The present study demonstrates the results of an ensemble modelling approach for assessing the impact of shipping emissions on current and future air quality concentrations and exposure in the coastal Mediterranean region.Ensemble model means were calculated based on the results of three regional or global dispersion models (EMEP, SILAM and CMAQ) to simulate annual and seasonal atmospheric pollutant dispersion patterns in the Mediterranean region, under the baseline 2018 scenario and two 2050 future scenarios developed within the EMERGE (Evaluation, control and Mitigation of the EnviRonmental impacts of shippinG Emissions) project. The selected scenarios examine the impact of a) the designation of a Mediterranean Sulfur/Nitrogen Emission Control Area (SECA/NECA) and the extensive use of open-loop scrubbers, Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems and Selective Catalytic Reduction systems on future shipping emissions (Scenario 3 - S3) and b) the increased use of methane and methanol as alternative fuels in 2050 (Scenario 8 - S8).Ensemble model results were combined with population data for calculating population-weighted concentrations of legislated atmospheric pollutants for 30 Mediterranean coastal cities, representing exposure of city inhabitants to current and predicted future air pollution levels.The findings of the present study reveal significant annual city average reductions of SO2 and PM2.5 shipping related exposure for both S3 (89.78 % reduction) and S8 (96.22 % reduction), while shipping induced NO2 city-average exposure levels were efficiently controlled in S3 (42.74 % reduction) but not in S8 (4.39 % reduction). The reported results need to be specifically considered in the development of policy recommendations on shipping emission control for the Mediterranean region."

 Dust aerosols are transported over long distances before reaching the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), where they mix with local pollutants, resulting in unique physicochemical properties, such as a high aging degree. An analysis of the annual trend of dust events in the YRD reveals an increasing impact of dust aerosols in the region. This study investigates the effect of dust aerosols on cloud liquid water content (CLWC) in the YRD. During dust events, CLWC exhibits a significant decline, decreasing by approximately 42.3 % compared to background levels. To further assess this impact, both the Fixed Effects (FE) model and the Structural Equation Model (SEM) are employed, confirming the substantial inhibitory effect of dust aerosols on CLWC. The FE model estimates that dust aerosols contribute to a 25.37 % reduction in CLWC. Moreover, model results suggest that relying solely on aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, without considering coarse-mode aerosol optical depth (CAOD), may obscure the pronounced influence of dust aerosols. The SEM results further reveal that the fitting coefficients between AOD and CAOD can differ by up to 50 %, highlighting the potential underestimation of the inhibitory effects of dust aerosols. This study underscores the necessity of incorporating particle size information in aerosol-climate effect research to improve the accuracy of assessments."

 The development of state-of-the-art analytical techniques for organic tracers and the application of receptor modeling, such as positive matrix factorization (PMF), provide a robust framework for source apportionment of organic aerosols. This study presents a detailed examination of both biogenic and anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) tracers in the Greater Bay Area. The inclusion of a diverse suite of molecular markers in PMF analysis has enabled the identification of six secondary source factors, including specific SOA factors derived from various precursors, demonstrating superior source resolution compared to traditional methods. The study also compares SOA estimates from chamber-generated mass conversion factors with PMF results, highlighting qualitative consistencies and discrepancies between the two approaches that suggest further refinement in tracer-based methods. Our findings indicate a need for additional tracers to further delineate mixed factors, underscore the importance of comprehensive tracer data in enhancing source apportionment capabilities, and provide crucial insights for air quality management and policy formulation in the region."

 Concentration and sources of PM2.5 components especially black carbon (BC) in Beijing have changed significantly in recent years under the influence of numerous air pollution prevention and control policies. To evaluate the influence of control policies as well as the long-term variation of BC sources, hourly time-resolution BC measurements, with simultaneous measurements of multiple chemical species of PM2.5, were performed continuously from 2016 to 2019 in Beijing. Here, six major sources of BC including aged BC were resolved by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) with BC and other 18 species of PM2.5. The aged BC source resolved by PMF was validated by BC data from single-particle soot photometer (SP2) and single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS) for the first time in Beijing. The results showed that BC concentration decreased significantly from 2016 to 2019 with approximately 46 % of the decrease attributed to coal burning reduction. The sources of BC apportioned by PMF were compared to the emission inventory of BC and the best correlation was found between coal BC from PMF and residential BC from emission inventory. However, the contribution of traffic BC (from 40 % to 53 %) and aged BC (from 12 % to 15 %) increased during the study period. The major source of BC pollution episodes has shifted from coal combustion to traffic source. This study provided observation-based evidence for the effectiveness of air pollution control policies on BC, and provided guidance for future BC source control in Beijing."

 Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from woodsmoke is a national and global public health concern. While wood heat use is increasing in the Northeast U.S., exposure to woodsmoke in rural valleys in this region remains understudied. Low-cost sensors have recently emerged as a promising strategy to better assess PM2.5 exposure in communities across the globe. However, real-world, long-term community air monitoring studies deploying low-cost sensors are lacking. Such studies are necessary to validate performance over time for the goals of assessing exposure trends and providing practical guidance to future community-scale projects. Here, we evaluated PM2.5 community-wide exposure over four years in a rural, woodsmoke impacted community that deployed a Purple Air network. We determined significant differences between the PM2.5 regulatory reference monitor and Purple Air PM2.5 concentrations across the community, over multiple heating seasons, at both hourly (p < 0.01) and 8-h average time intervals (p < 0.001). PM2.5 was especially elevated in the evenings (6 p.m.–2 a.m.), with a maximum 1-h average of 81.7 μg/m3 and a maximum 8-h average of 78.7 μg/m3. Consistent with other performance evaluations in the literature, we determined Purple Air sensors have low bias after correction (2.4 % Normalized Mean Bias Error [NMBE], 3.3 μg/m3 Root Mean Square Error [RMSE]). Co-located sensors were reliable in harsh winter conditions for up to three years. We suggest quality assurance, data management, correction model selection, and citizen science partnerships are critical considerations for sensor network deployments aiming to assess long-term exposure and health."

 Ozone (O3) pollution is a critical environmental issue, especially in rapidly developing industrial regions such as Dushanzi, an oil and petrochemical hub in northwestern China. This paper investigated the first 4-day ozone pollution event in Dushanzi in June 2023. Meteorological parameters, O3 and its precursor concentrations were utilized, combined with the Observation-based model (OBM), Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), and backward trajectory analysis, to investigate the causes of ozone pollution in the region. The OBM-MCM model assesses the sensitivity of ozone and its generation-loss mechanisms, revealing that O3 is mainly generated through the HO2+NO pathway and lost via the NO2+RO2 pathway. On polluted days, the region falls into the VOCs-NOx collaborative control zone, with an optimal VOCs to NOx reduction ratio of 1:2. Under this reduction ratio, focusing on emissions reduction from the petrochemical industry, particularly controlling OVOCs, would be beneficial for reducing ozone pollution. Based on OFP and PMF analyses, petrochemical emissions were identified as the primary source of O3 pollution, with OVOCs contributing the most to O3 formation. Meteorological data revealed that high temperatures, low humidity and low wind speeds are external triggers of ozone pollution in the region. Meanwhile, the impact of long-range transport in the eastern Shihezi-Changji region cannot be ignored. This study provides important scientific basis for local governments to formulate O3 pollution control strategies."

 Upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) aerosols are long-lived and play an essential role in the global radiation budget and climate, primarily contributed by volcanic eruptions and wildfires. This study explored two UTLS aerosol perturbation events over Wuhan (30.5°N, 114.4°E) in 2021, observed using ground-based lidar and multiple spaceborne instruments. The first event, on 16–17 April, involved a stratospheric aerosol layer at altitudes of 14.0–15.3 km, originating from the La Soufrière volcano eruption (13.33°N, 61.18°W) on 9 April. The volcanic aerosols were rapidly transported eastward across the Northern Hemisphere tropics, spanning half the globe within a week. Particle depolarization ratio δp values were 0.10–0.15 and 0.06–0.10 for each day, respectively, indicating that some particles remained relatively fresh due to the short transport time; aerosol backscatter coefficient was 2 × 10−5–8 × 10−5 km−1 sr−1. The second event occurred from 20 to 24 July, involving a prominent aerosol layer at altitudes of 16.5–17.0 km. For the first time, UTLS aerosols over central China were linked to a Siberian wildfire event nine days earlier, which released substantial smoke particles. The smoke plume was transported along a clockwise path influenced by the Asian monsoon anticyclone, enhancing the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (sAOD) to 0.006–0.010, approximately double the background sAOD (0.0044) over Wuhan. A layer-mean δp of 0.08 suggested the dominance of partially aged, non-spherical smoke particles. These two events offer valuable insights into the origins and transport mechanisms of UTLS aerosols over mid-latitude East Asia."

 The assimilation of radar reflectivity plays a crucial role in improving the initial fields of numerical weather prediction (NWP). This study employs a one-dimensional (1D) Bayesian scheme to retrieve pseudo-humidity observations from radar reflectivity, which are subsequently assimilated within a three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) framework. The results demonstrate that under dry-biased background field, the joint assimilation of radial velocity and pseudo humidity observations more markedly enhances moisture condition compared to radial velocity assimilation alone, resulting in improved quantitative precipitation forecast skills. Additionally, a valid-time-shifting (VTS) method is implemented to augment a priori database in 1D Bayesian retrieval by introducing sub-ensembles before and after the analysis time, aiming to mitigate temporal and spatial displacement errors in the NWP system. Two assimilation experiments are conducted to evaluate the impact of the VTS scheme on severe convection prediction. It can be found that the VTS method improves consistency in thermodynamic and dynamic structures. The assessments of short-term precipitation forecasts confirm that the application of VTS scheme improves the prediction accuracy of precipitation intensity and spatial distribution."

 Water vapor is significant in numerical weather prediction. As an important water vapor content indicator, precipitable water vapor (PWV) exhibits a strong correlation with actual precipitation. Limited by the measurement mechanism and the distribution of sensors, the existing measurements suffer from issues such as low spatial-temporal resolution and discontinuous observation. In this study, the PWV retrieval method from geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (GEO SAR) image is proposed based on map drift (MD) autofocus method. By leveraging the navigation signal to deduce water vapor, we attempt to estimate the phase delay to measure PWV. The method utilizes the phase error caused by tropospheric propagation as valuable information. Continuous PWV measurement over a large area is achieved through single observation, compared with navigation signal measurement. Zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) is calculated and brought in phase compensation to obtain imaging result. Zenith wet delay (ZWD) is calculated by estimating quadratic phase by MD algorithm, and then PWV can be retrieved with conversion coefficient. Taking Hong Kong region, which experiences heavy rainfall, as the study area, and combining data from International GNSS Service (IGS), the Hong Kong Observatory, and the FY-3D satellite, the PWV retrieval accuracy is verified. The proposed algorithm can retrieve all-weather, full-time, high spatial-temporal resolution PWV data."

Such adatoms are shown to be storable in ambient conditions for at least a week in the dark and are observed (“read”) using low-intensity surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Writing at higher optical intensities stabilizes the atomic protrusion through light-induced local restructuring, which imposes a higher energy barrier for its return into the metal surface. Fluctuations in these “picocavity” SERS spectra show that while adatom movement is significantly slower under low light intensities, ambient thermal energy still enables them to explore the surrounding energetic landscape.
