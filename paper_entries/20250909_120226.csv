Blossey,Tropical cirrus evolution in a kilometer-scale model with improved ice microphysics,"The evolution of tropical cirrus clouds is poorly understood, which contributes to large uncertainties in climate projections. To address this issue, we use novel tracers in a cloud-resolving model to track the life cycle of cirrus clouds. This approach provides insights into cloud formation, ice crystal evolution, and radiative effects of cirrus clouds. Additionally, we improve the model's cloud microphysics using a simple, computationally efficient approach that can be applied to other models. 
 Tropical cirrus clouds form through in situ ice nucleation below the homogeneous freezing temperature of water or through detrainment from deep convection. Despite their importance, limited understanding of their evolution and formation pathways contributes to large uncertainty in climate projections. To address these challenges, we implement novel passive tracers in the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) cloud-resolving model to track the three-dimensional development of cirrus clouds. One tracer tracks air parcels exiting convective updrafts, revealing a rapid decline in ice crystal size and number as anvils age. Another tracer focuses on in situ cirrus, capturing their formation in the cold upper atmosphere and the subsequent reduction in their ice crystal number over time. We find that in situ cirrus dominate at colder temperatures and lower ice water contents, while anvil cirrus prevail at temperatures > −60 °C. Despite the frequent occurrence of in situ cirrus within the tropical tropopause layer, they account for only 6 %–7 % of the total tropical cirrus cloud top-of-the-atmosphere radiative effect. These findings improve our ability to assess the distinct roles of convective and in situ cirrus in shaping tropical cirrus properties and their impacts on climate.We also improve the model's representation of tropical cirrus through simple, computationally inexpensive microphysics modifications, improving agreement with tropical aircraft observations. We show that updrafts critical for tropical cirrus formation are only resolved in our simulations at a horizontal grid spacing of 250 m – much finer than those used in global storm-resolving models."
10.5194/acp-25-9981-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了利用机载远红外测量数据优化冰云反演的问题。论文重点在于利用15-100微米波段的辐射对冰云性质（特别是冰晶形状）的高灵敏度。研究通过实际的机载观测数据，进行了冰云性质的反演，并将结果与云的实地测量数据进行对比评估。研究发现，加入远红外数据能够更好地区分不同的冰晶形状，并降低云顶高度和云光学厚度的反演不确定性。虽然现有的冰云光学模型存在局限性，但该研究为远红外观测在改进冰云性质反演方面的潜力提供了观测支持。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是与大气成分（冰云）、卫星/传感器（远红外传感器）以及应用（冰云性质反演）有关。,"['ice cloud properties', 'far-infrared radiation', 'remote sensing', 'aircraft observation', 'cirrus cloud', 'cloud optical thickness', 'cloud top height', 'cloud effective radius', 'ice crystal habit', 'ESA Far-Infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring mission']",Sanjeevani Panditharatne;Caroline Cox;Rui Song;Richard Siddans;Richard Bantges;Jonathan Murray;Stuart Fox;Cathryn Fox;Helen Brindley,Exploiting airborne far-infrared measurements to optimise an ice cloud retrieval,"Upwelling radiation with wavelengths between 15 and 100 µm is theorised to be highly sensitive to the properties of ice clouds, particularly the shape of the ice crystals. We exploit this sensitivity and perform the first retrieval of ice cloud properties using these wavelengths from an observation taken on an aircraft and evaluate it against measurements of the cloud’s properties. 
 Studies have indicated that far-infrared radiances hold significant information about the microphysics of ice clouds, particularly the ice crystal habit. In support of the European Space Agency's Far-Infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring mission, we perform the first retrieval on an observation of coincident upwelling far- and mid-infrared radiances taken from an aircraft above a cirrus cloud layer. Four retrievals are performed: including and neglecting the far-infrared portion of the spectrum and assuming two different habit mixes. Results are compared to in situ measurements of the cloud optical thickness, cloud top height, cloud effective radius, and habit distributions. We find that despite the known limitations of ice cloud optical property models, all the retrievals show agreement within the in situ measurements of the cloud optical thickness, cloud top height, and cloud effective radius. However, the inclusion of the far-infrared enables a distinction between two different habits that is not possible using only mid-infrared channels. Furthermore, in this case study, the uncertainty in the retrieval of cloud top height and cloud optical thickness halves with the inclusion of the far-infrared. As with other studies, we also see an additional degree of freedom for the temperature and water vapour retrievals. Our study highlights the need for the improvement of current ice cloud optical models, with the radiance residuals from the converged retrievals still exceeding the instrument uncertainty within the far-infrared. However, it provides observational support for the theoretical improvement that far-infrared observations could bring to retrievals of ice cloud properties."

Both OMI and Pandora show that HCHO has a strong seasonal dependence. The daily amount of NO2 pollution is underestimated by the OMI satellite observations. Pandora O3 measurements have been successfully compared with hourly satellite measurements from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC). 
 Observations of trace gases, such as O3, HCHO, and NO2, and their seasonal dependence can be made using satellite and ground-based data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite and Pandora ground-based instruments. Both operate with spectrometers that have similar characteristics in wavelength range and spectral resolution that enable them to retrieve total column amounts of formaldehyde (TCHCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (TCNO2) and total column ozone (TCO). The polar orbiting OMI observes at 13:30 ± 0:25 LST (local solar time) plus an occasional second side-scan point 90 min later at mid-latitudes. The ground-based Pandora spectrometer system observes the direct sun all day, with a temporal resolution of 2 min. At most sites, the Pandora data show a strong seasonal dependence for TCO and TCHCHO and less seasonal dependence for TCNO2. Use of a low-pass filter LOWESS(3-month) can reveal the seasonal dependence of TCNO2 for both OMI and Pandora at mid-latitude sites usually correlated with seasonal heating using natural gas or oil. Compared to Pandora, OMI underestimates the amount of NO2 air pollution that occurs during most days, as the OMI TCNO2 retrieval occurs around 13:30 ± 0:25 LST, which tends to be near the frequent minimum of the daily TCNO2 time series. Even when the Pandora data are restricted to between 13:00 and 14:00 LST, OMI retrieves less TCNO2 than Pandora over urban sites because of OMI's large field of view. The seasonal behavior of TCHCHO is mostly caused by the release of HCHO precursors from plant growth and emissions from lakes that peak in the summer, as observed by Pandora and OMI. Long-term averages show that OMI TCHCHO usually has the same seasonal dependence but differs in magnitude from the amount measured by Pandora and is frequently larger. Comparisons of OMI total column NO2 and HCHO with Pandora daily time series show both agreement and disagreement at various sites and for different days, with the Pandora results frequently being larger. For ozone, daily time-dependent comparisons of OMI TCO with those retrieved by Pandora show good agreement in most cases. Additional diurnal comparisons are shown of Pandora TCO with hourly retrievals during a day from the EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) spacecraft instrument orbiting the Earth–Sun Lagrange point L1."

Through simulations and analysis of real data, we show that NH3 can be measured effectively from spectra with reduced resolution, either in a contiguous spectral range or in select well-chosen bands. This approach opens possibilities for the development of smaller dedicated instruments for observing NH3 at high spatial resolution. 
 Over the past decade, hyperspectral infrared sounders on satellites have offered global measurements of atmospheric ammonia (NH3), providing valuable insights into its sources. However, due to their coarse spatial resolution and gaps in spatial coverage, inferring emissions from smaller sources or utilizing data from single overpasses remains very challenging. While a high-spatial-resolution imaging sounder would greatly enhance monitoring capabilities, developing an instrument that combines high spatial and spectral resolution is technologically difficult and expensive. Here, we analyze the feasibility of measuring NH3 with instruments having a largely reduced spectral coverage and resolution compared to current operational sounders. We explore the performance trade-offs using simulated spectra, measurements from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite sounder, and spectra obtained from aircraft. The measured spectra are degraded spectrally, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as NH3 measurement uncertainty, signal-to-noise ratio, and false alarm rate. Instruments that measure across a continuous spectral interval and instruments covering specific well-chosen spectral bands are both examined. We demonstrate that a future dedicated NH3 sounder with as few as 3 spectral bands of 1–5 cm−1 is feasible and would enable the detection of NH3 both at high spatial resolution and across continental scales. The advantage of choosing well-defined spectral bands is demonstrated, e.g., by showing that an instrument with 5 specific bands of 5 cm−1 performs similarly to one with 20 contiguous channels across 900–1000 cm−1. Additionally, we show that at high spectral resolutions (below 5 cm−1), the NH3 measurement capability is primarily driven by the instrumental noise. As the spectral resolution or number of measurement bands decreases, spectral interferences from other atmospheric constituents and the surface start to dominate the NH3 retrieval uncertainty budget, fundamentally limiting the unambiguous identification of NH3."

Flynn;Julia Moemken;Joaquim G. Pinto;Michael K. Schutte;Gabriele Messori,CLIMK–WINDS: a new database of extreme  European winter windstorms,"We created a new, publicly available, database of the top 50 most extreme European winter windstorms from each of four different meteorological input data sets covering the years 1995–2015. We found variability in all aspects of our database, from which storms were included in the top 50 storms for each input to the storms' spatial variability. We urge users of our database to consider the storms as identified from two or more input sources within our database where possible. 
 The CLIMK–WINDS (CLimes IMK – WINDstorm) database is a new, publicly available, database of extreme European windstorm footprints for the extended winter season during 1995–2015. In contrast with previously compiled European windstorm databases, it includes storm footprints derived from four different data sets, rather than a single source: the ERA5 reanalysis, the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis for Europe, the COSMO-Climate Limited-area Mode regional climate model driven by ERA5 on the EURO-CORDEX domain and simulation output from the same model but on an enlarged Germany domain with higher horizontal resolution. The database includes the footprints themselves, expressed as the relative daily maximum wind gusts associated with a storm event, the daily maximum wind gusts in absolute magnitude associated with the footprints and a measure of storm severity.  We applied a consistent methodology, the storm loss index, across input data sets for identifying storm footprints and assessing their severity. We identified and included the storm footprints associated with the 50 most severe storms, or top 50 storms, within each of the four input data sets. This enables a direct comparison between the footprints derived from the different input data sets, eases future efforts to extend the time record of the database or to include additional input data sets and enables assessment of uncertainty in the footprints. Moreover, since we derived the top 50 storms from each input data set at its native horizontal resolution, the database also allows us to characterise the impact that horizontal resolution can have on footprint identification and severity assessment. We find that the choice of input data set – including the data's horizontal resolution – can have major effects on extreme storm identification and characterisation. Different storms were identified as belonging to the top 50 storms in the different data sets, and storm footprints for common storms displayed substantial variability across the data sets. A comparison of our database with two existing windstorm databases also highlights the important role of the footprint detection methodology. The CLIMK–WINDS database thus supports both the research community and the insurance industry in exploring the data set, methodology and resolution dependence of assessments of extreme storm hazards.

Using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1) data and a twofold strategy to address temporal gaps, the method produced 30 m gridded forest height mosaics for the northeastern United States and China, demonstrating promising accuracies and offering potential for fusing data from future missions. 
 This paper presents a global-to-local fusion approach combining spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) and lidar to create large-scale mosaics of forest stand height. The forest height estimates are derived based on a semi-empirical InSAR scattering model, which links the forest height to repeat-pass InSAR coherence magnitudes. The sparsely yet extensively distributed lidar samples provided by the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission enable the parameterization of the signal model at a finer spatial scale. The proposed global-to-local fitting strategy allows for the efficient use of lidar samples to determine the adaptive model at a regional scale, leading to improved forest height estimates by integrating InSAR–lidar under nearly concurrent acquisition conditions. This is supported by fusing the second generation of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-2) and GEDI data at several representative forest sites. This approach is further applied to the open-access ALOS InSAR data to evaluate its large-scale mapping capabilities. To address temporal mismatch between the GEDI and ALOS acquisitions, disturbances such as deforestation are identified by integrating ALOS-2 backscatter products and GEDI data. A modified signal model is further developed to account for natural forest growth over temperate forest regions where the intact forest landscape, along with forest height, remains quite stable and only changes slightly as trees grow. In the absence of detailed statistical data on forest growth, the modified signal model can be well approximated using the original model at the regional scale via local fitting. To validate this, two forest height mosaic maps based on the open-access ALOS-1 data were generated for the entire northeastern regions of the US and China with total area of 18 and 152 million ha, respectively. The validation of the forest height estimates demonstrates improved accuracy achieved by the proposed approach compared to the previous efforts, i.e., reducing from a 4.4 m RMSE at a few-hectare pixel size to 3.8 m RMSE at a sub-hectare pixel size. This updated fusion approach not only fills in the sparse spatial sampling of individual GEDI footprints, but also improves the accuracy of forest height estimates by 20 % compared to the interpolated GEDI maps. Extensive evaluation of forest height inversion against Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) lidar data indicates an accuracy of 3–4 m over flat areas and 4–5 m over hilly areas in the New England region, whereas the forest height estimates over northeastern China are best compared with small-footprint lidar validation data even at an accuracy of below 3.5 m and with a coefficient of determination (R2) mostly above 0.6. Given the achieved accuracy for forest height estimates, this fusion prototype offers a cost-effective solution for public users to obtain wall-to-wall forest height maps at a large scale using freely accessible spaceborne repeat-pass L-band InSAR (e.g., forthcoming NISAR) and spaceborne lidar (e.g., GEDI) data. These products are available via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11640299 (Yu and Lei, 2024)."

Using satellite images and laser data from both aircraft and space, we applied deep learning and statistical fusion to produce accurate estimates. This map helps reveal where forests have been disturbed and how they recover over time, offering a valuable tool to support forest protection and climate policy. 
 Forests are vital for the carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and climate regulation, making the precise and continuous monitoring of forest structure attributes such as canopy height essential. Here we present a two decades long (2004–2024), 30 m resolution annual canopy height dataset for Italy, developed using a time-series deep learning framework that integrates Landsat optical imagery with LiDAR observations. Two UNET models were independently trained using canopy height reference data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne LiDAR mission. Annual canopy height predictions from each model were fused using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to enhance spatial consistency and temporal continuity. Validation against ground-based measurements from the Italian National Forest Inventory (NFI) demonstrated high predictive accuracy (mean absolute error = 3.98 m). To further evaluate the utility of our dataset, we derived a canopy height change-based disturbance product and validated it against observed events (mean precision = 0.64 for 2005–2016). In addition, we assessed post-disturbance recovery by monitoring canopy height regrowth in areas affected during 2004–2005, tracking changes annually through 2024 across various Italian biomes. Our results highlight the importance of integrating multi-source remote sensing data with deep learning and Bayesian data fusion for monitoring forest structural dynamics. The final dataset is publicly available via Zenodo and provides a reproducible and scalable resource to support forest research, ecological monitoring, and climate-related policy-making."

In this paper, we present an explicit extension to binary forecasts of hydroclimatic extremes. Seventeen verification metrics for binary forecasts are employed, and scorecards are generated to showcase the predictive performance. The extension facilitates more comprehensive comparisons of hydroclimatic forecasts and provides useful information for forecast applications. 
 Binary forecasts of hydroclimatic extremes play a critical part in disaster prevention and risk management. While the recent WeatherBench 2 provides a versatile framework for verifying deterministic and ensemble forecasts of continuous variables, this paper presents an extension to binary forecasts of the occurrence versus non-occurrence of hydroclimatic extremes. Specifically, 17 verification metrics of the accuracy and discrimination of binary forecasts are employed and scorecards are generated to showcase the predictive performance. A case study is devised for binary forecasts of wet and warm extremes obtained from both deterministic and ensemble forecasts generated by three data-driven models, i.e., Pangu-Weather, GraphCast and FuXi, and two numerical weather prediction products, i.e., the high-resolution forecasting (HRES) and ensemble forecasting (ENS) of the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The results show that the receiver operating characteristic skill score (ROCSS) serves as a suitable metric due to its relative insensitivity to the rarity of hydroclimatic extremes. For wet extremes, the GraphCast tends to outperform the IFS HRES when using the total precipitation of ERA5 reanalysis data as the ground truth. For warm extremes, Pangu-Weather, GraphCast and FuXi tend to be more skillful than the IFS HRES within 3 d lead time but become less skillful as lead time increases. In the meantime, the IFS ENS tends to provide skillful forecasts of both wet and warm extremes at different lead times and at the global scale. Through diagnostic plots of forecast time series at selected grid cells, it is observed that at longer lead times, forecasts generated by data-driven models tend to be smoother and less skillful compared to those generated by physical models. Overall, the extension of WeatherBench 2 facilitates more comprehensive comparisons of hydroclimatic forecasts and provides useful information for forecast applications."

An emergent approach to derive crop productivity estimates similar to those from GGCMs are emulators that mimic the original model, but typically with considerable bias. Here we present a modelling package that trains emulators with very high accuracy and high computational gain, providing a basis for more comprehensive scenario assessments. 
 Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) are simulation tools designed for global, spatially explicit estimation of crop productivity and associated externalities. Key areas for their application are climate impact and adaptation studies. As GGCMs are typically computationally costly and require comprehensive data pre- and post-processing, GGCM emulators are gaining increasing popularity. Earlier emulators have typically been published pre-trained on synthetic weather and management combinations. Here, we present a novel computational pipeline CROp Model Emulator Suite (CROMES) v1.0 that serves for flexibly training GGCM emulators on data commonly available from GGCM simulations. Essentially, CROMES consists of modules to (1) process climate data from daily resolution netCDF files to (sub-)growing season aggregates as climate features, (2) combine various feature types (climate, soil, crop management), (3) train emulators using machine-learning algorithms, and (4) produce predictions. Exemplary, we apply CROMES to train emulators on simulations for rainfed maize from the GGCM EPIC-IIASA and climate projections from a single GCM to subsequently test their skill in predicting crop yields for unseen climate projections from other GCMs. Depending on the training and target data, the regression statistics between GGCM simulations and predictions across all points in time and space are in the ranges R2 = 0.97 to 0.98, slope = 0.99 to 1.01, and intercept = −0.06 to +0.06. The RMSE ranges between 0.49 and 0.65 t ha−1. Spatially, patterns are evident with lowest performance in (semi-)arid regions where aggregation of weather data may result in higher information loss while permanent crop growth limitations may hamper evaluation statistics as well. The gain in computational speed for predictions is at more than an order of magnitude with time required to produce target features and subsequent predictions at about 30min on common hardware. We expect CROMES to be of utility in covering more comprehensively uncertainty in climate impact projections, evaluations of adaptation options, and spatio-temporal assessments of crop productivity."

This study simulates waves along the Australian coast using advanced physical and numerical schemes. Model verification with altimeter and buoy data shows good performance. A two-step parameterization improves accuracy in the complex Great Barrier Reef. This study will help us better understand coastal wave climates and assess sea states, enabling us to better develop, protect, and use the sea. 
 Numerical simulations of ocean surface waves along the Australian coast are performed with the spectral wave model WAVEWATCH III (WW3) and the state-of-the-art physics and numerics. A large-scale, high-resolution (1–15 km) unstructured mesh is designed for better resolving the extensive Australian coastline. Based on verification against altimeter and buoy observations, it is found that the WW3 simulations, with an observation-based source term package (i.e., ST6) and other relevant physical processes, perform reasonably well in predicting wave heights and periods in most regions. Nonetheless, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) represents a challenging region for the wave model, in which wave heights are severely overestimated because most of the individual coral reefs and their strong dissipative effects could not be resolved by the local mesh. A two-step modeling strategy is proposed here to address this problem. First, individual coral reefs are regarded as unresolved obstacles and thus complete barriers to wave energy. Second, we adopt the unresolved obstacles source term proposed recently to parameterize the dissipative impact of these subgrid coral reefs. It is then demonstrated that this subgrid-scale reef parameterization enhances the model performance in the GBR dramatically, reducing the wave height bias from above 100 % to below 20 %. The source term balance and the sensitivity of model results to the grid resolution around the GBR are also discussed, illustrating the applicability of this two-step strategy to km-scale wave simulations."

OPEs in PM2.5–10 showed the highest deposition efficiency in the upper respiratory tract (93.8%), followed by PM1–2.5 (77.5%) and PM1 (76.2%). Humidity enhanced deposition, whereas temperature had a minimal effect. Median ∑17OPEs concentrations in EBC and sputum were 0.29 ± 0.03 ng/m3 and 0.22 ± 0.06 ng/mL, indicating that ∼20.8% of inhaled ∑17OPEs was exhaled. Significant correlations (p < 0.05) between airborne particle-phase and exhaled OPEs suggest that the exhaled fraction derives mainly from particles.

Catalytic oxidation is a leading VOC abatement method but suffers from catalyst deactivation due to metal sintering and competitive adsorption in complex mixtures. Strong metal–support interactions (SMSIs) provide atomic level control of interfacial electronic and geometric structures. SMSI enables bidirectional charge transfer, d band center modulation, oxygen vacancy generation, and tunable encapsulation that together promote O2 activation, lower barriers, and impart thermal and chemical robustness. This review synthesizes mechanistic insights and recent progress in SMSI-enabled VOC oxidation, integrating in situ and operando probes with kinetics. Reactivity and selectivity across aromatics, alkanes, oxygenates, and chlorinated species are rationalized by SMSI-mediated tuning of adsorption and intermediate evolution. Practical levers include control of particle size and dispersion, core–shell architectures, metal loading, and support acidity or basicity. Emerging directions include single atom catalysts, high entropy alloys, and nonmetal supports. Key challenges concern the dynamic evolution of SMSI under realistic feeds and the scalable, reproducible synthesis of interfaces. Future developments combining in situ characterization with data-driven catalyst design hold promise for achieving durable, high-performance VOC abatement with reduced precious metal usage."

While hydroxyl metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are commonly used exposure biomarkers of combustion-originated air pollutants, methylated PAHs are more abundant in woodsmoke than other sources. Thus, urinary PAH carboxylic acids, which are metabolites of methylated PAHs, may serve as more sensitive biomarkers of wildfire exposure. In this exploratory study, we developed an LC-MS/MS method to simultaneously quantify hydroxylated and carboxylic metabolites of PAHs and methyl-PAHs in urine. This method was then applied to 56 urine samples collected from 8 campers before, during, and after a 4-h exposure to campfire. Campers also wore silicone wristbands to monitor ambient PAHs. We found that 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid (1-PYRCA) levels increased significantly at 4 h (96.9%, 95% CI: 2.60–101%), 6 h (96.8%, 95% CI: 5.85–107%), and 8 h (92.5%, 95% CI: 3.59–99.2%) and returned to baseline levels at 24 h. In contrast, the campfire exposure did not significantly increase other urinary PAH metabolites. Wristband PAHs also significantly increased during the 4-h exposure.

This work comprehensively investigated the variation characteristics, driving mechanisms, and future projections of DPEs in the TB by leveraging integrated space–air–ground multisource observations combined with numerical modeling. Results show that DPEs are widespread in the TB. 78.55% of the DPEs that occurred had daily precipitation intensity of <3 mm d–1, and 92.85% of the DPEs produced with daily minimum horizontal visibility of <5 km. Statistical analyses suggested that DPEs might act as one of the main contributors to extreme precipitation events in the TB. Dust event creates conditions of moisture supply and dynamic forcing favorable for precipitation, while enhanced water vapor conditions further amplify dust–cloud interactions. Although the frequency and precipitation amount of DPEs are projected to decline by 2100 across various emission scenarios, they are expected to persist at elevated levels until 2050, particularly under medium-to-high emission trajectories. The findings of this study provide new insights regarding climate change in arid–semiarid regions and the forecasting and early warning of extreme precipitation events."

Results showed that low temperatures significantly increased cardiovascular and respiratory disease risks, with effects more pronounced than those of high temperatures. The minimum mortality temperature was approximately 12–15 °C for mortality of respiratory and cardiovascular disease.

Both PBMTSP and PBM2.5 exhibited positive odd and even mass‐independent fractionation (MIF), with Δ199Hg values in PBM2.5 enriched by 0.25 ± 0.35‰ relative to PBMTSP. The slopes between Δ199Hg and Δ201Hg, along with sulfur MIF and backward trajectories, suggest that intense photoreduction reactions during long‐distance and high‐altitude transport are the primary driver of the elevated Δ199Hg in fine particulate matter. Importantly, significant positive MIF signatures can occur not only in remote areas but also in anthropogenic Hg emission regions, underscoring the underestimated role of atmospheric transport, particularly on clean days."

Nitrous oxide (N2 ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}$O) is a compelling light‐path proxy, particularly in challenging environments such as the humid tropics, where current retrieval methods face low data yields due to persistent partial cloud cover and substantial surface heterogeneity.

Radiative transfer simulations demonstrate that N2 ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}$O effectively mitigates errors from scattering and albedo variability, especially for CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$, demonstrating consistent performance across high aerosol optical depths and low albedos. While CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ requires small adjustments due to its partially saturated band, the proxy approach offers significant advantages.

We implemented two versions of a coupled ocean‐atmosphere Regional Climate Model (RCM), each run at 15 km grid resolution and differing solely in their cumulus parameterization schemes. Our analysis reveals that the RCMs were able to generate TEWs in the domain even though the global atmospheric reanalysis forcing the regional models generated a few TEWs. This seems to suggest an in situ generation of these TEWs in the domain, which is consistent with earlier studies that examined TEW over the IAS region. There were also crucial differences between the two versions of the RCMs, suggesting that the cumulus parameterization scheme has an important bearing on the generation of TEWs in the simulation over this region. In one instance of the RCM simulation, the response of the TEW was much stronger, where the convective activity was enhanced with both convective and stratiform precipitation associated with TEW higher than the other cumulus scheme used in the other RCM simulation. However, the limitations and advantages of the impacts of the two cumulus parameterization schemes on the overall simulation of TEWs refrain us from claiming one scheme is superior to the other. Nonetheless, the study highlights the importance of the cumulus scheme and the benefit of dynamic downscaling on the simulation of TEWs."

However, the relationship between precipitation and QBO index at different stratospheric levels is inconsistent. This study identifies two distinct vertical structures of stratospheric zonal wind that influence precipitation in the tropics: (a) westerlies at 50 and 70 hPa combined with easterlies above 50 hPa generate warm anomalies near the tropopause; (b) easterlies at 20–70 hPa paired with westerlies at 10 hPa induce strong cold anomalies near the tropopause. Temperature anomalies affect atmospheric static stability, with negative anomalies increasing high cloud cover and strengthening convection. Additionally, the large‐scale circulation links stratospheric zonal winds to deep convection. The vertical structure of the stratospheric zonal wind influences the intensity and positioning of the Hadley and Walker circulations, thereby shaping the spatial distribution of tropical precipitation. A linear combination of time series from these two wind structures explains a significant part of interannual tropical precipitation variability after removing the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation signal. Evaluation of 15 Phase 6 of the International Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models shows that eight reproduce the observed relationship between stratospheric wind structures and tropical precipitation with reasonable accuracy.

The results using survey data indicate that increased heat, drought and excessive wetness are collectively associated with reduced yield stability for corn and soybean. We find that the changes in corn and soybean yield stability in the US Midwest are predominantly related to heat stress.

Here, the authors quantify such losses reported in the literature and point out the need to reduce non-radiative recombination for a breakthrough in power conversion efficiency. 
 The photovoltaic performance of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 is limited by open-circuit voltage losses (ΔVOC) in the radiative (ΔVOCRad) and non-radiative (ΔVOCNrad) limits, due to sub-bandgap absorption and deep defects, respectively. Recently, several devices with power conversion efficiencies approaching 15% have been reported, prompting renewed interest in the possibility that the key performance-limiting factors have been addressed. In this work, we analyze the sources of ΔVOC in these devices and offer directions for future research. We find that ΔVOCRad, arising from bandgap fluctuations and Urbach tails, has been significantly suppressed, with values comparable to those of commercial Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 solar cells. However, the recombination parameter J0, which is more directly related to ΔVOCNrad, shows only modest improvement and must be reduced by four to six orders of magnitude to compete with Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2. To approach the theoretical efficiency limit, future work should focus on more directly addressing deep defects and ΔVOCNrad.

Herein, we report the concept, design and optimization of a microfluidic device based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection that can be potentially operated without electricity for analytical purposes. The device functions exploiting the concept of streaming potential-driven bipolar electrochemistry, where a potential difference, generated from the flow of an electrolyte through a microchannel under the influence of a pressure gradient, is the driving force for redox reactions. To our purpose, we employ such a device to drive the ECL reaction of an organic chromophore deposited onto the electrode surface by simply flowing an electrolytic solution containing a coreactant into the microfluidic system, and we successively apply such device for the detection of amines in water. Our device shows high reproducibility and satisfactory detection limits for tri-n-propylamine, demonstrating an original, and up to now unexplored, concept of energy saving microfluidic systems with integrated ECL detection.

 Precise control of spin states and spin-spin interactions in atomic-scale magnetic structures is crucial for spin-based quantum technologies. A promising architecture is molecular spin systems, which offer chemical tunability and scalability for larger structures. An essential component, in addition to the qubits themselves, is switchable qubit-qubit interactions that can be individually addressed. In this study, we present an electrically controlled single-molecule spin switch based on a bistable complex adsorbed on an insulating magnesium oxide film. The complex, which consists of an Fe adatom coupled to an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule, can be reversibly switched between two stable states using bias voltage pulses locally via the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope. Inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal a distinct change between a paramagnetic and a non-magnetic spin configuration. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of this molecular spin switch by using it to modify the electron spin resonance frequency of a nearby target FePc spin within a spin-spin coupled structure. Thus, we showcase how individual molecular machines can be utilized to create scalable and tunable quantum devices.

 The synthesis of thin crystalline two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) typically relies on reversible dynamic covalent reactions. While substantial progress has been made in solution-based and interfacial syntheses, achieving 2DPs through irreversible carbon-carbon coupling reactions remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present an on-liquid surface (a mixture of N,N-dimethylacetamide and water, DMAc-H2O) synthesis method for constructing diyne-linked 2DP (DY2DP) crystals via Glaser coupling, assisted by a perfluoro-surfactant (PFS) monolayer. In-situ spectroscopic and diffraction techniques reveal that the well-ordered PFS monolayer facilitates the accumulation of Cu+ ions and subsequent vertical coupling of acetylenic monomers on the DMAc-H2O surface. Building on these findings, we successfully synthesized micro-scale rod-shaped DY2DP-Por or graphdiyne (GDY) crystals through the polymerization of porphyrin- or benzene-based monomers, respectively.

Here, the authors reveal that DNA replication machinery transmits dual signals to control proper timing of centrosome duplication for genome stability 
 Copy number control of DNA and centrosomes is essential for accurate genetic inheritance. DNA replication and centrosome duplication have been recognized as parallel key events for cell division. Here, we discover that the DNA replication machinery directly regulates the licensing and execution processes of centrosome duplication to prevent centrosome amplification. We find that the microcephaly protein DONSON couples DNA replication initiation with Cdc6 translocation to centrosomes. The Cdc6 signal prevents the precocious occurrence of centriole disengagement, the licensing step for centrosome duplication. During DNA replication, DONSON inhibits replisome disassembly by interacting with the CMG helicase, maintaining the intrinsic S/G2 checkpoint signal that blocks centriole-to-centrosome conversion, the execution step for centrosome duplication. Disruption of these dual signals causes precocious centrosome duplication and chromosome mis-segregation, observed in DONSON patient cells. Our results reveal that the DNA replication machinery not only duplicates genetic material but also controls the system for its accurate segregation.

Here, the authors show that E. coli filament buckling modulates Min protein dynamics and determines division site placement after stress relief. 
 Bacteria often encounter physico-chemical stresses that disrupt division, leading to filamentation, where cells elongate without dividing. Although this adaptive response improves survival, it also exposes filaments to significant mechanical strain, raising questions about the mechanochemical feedback in bacterial systems. In this study, we investigate how mechanical strain modifies the geometry of bacterial filaments and influences the Min oscillatory system, a reaction-diffusion network central to division in Escherichia coli. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining quantitative fluorescence microscopy, biophysical modeling, microfluidics, and patterned growth substrates, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli filaments undergo a growth-induced buckling instability. This phenomenon modulates the spatiotemporal patterning of the Min system. Moreover, we show that synergistic mechanochemical effects determine the location of the division site after stress relief, effectively creating a mechanical “memory” for cytokinesis. Our findings underscore the critical role of mechanical forces and geometric effects in bacterial filamentation and provide new insights into the functional implications of mechanobiology in microbial systems.

 Extreme heat may affect added sugar consumption through the increased intake of drinks and frozen desserts, but such an impact is rarely quantified. Here, using individual transaction-level data for US households in 2004–2019, we find that added sugar consumption is positively related to temperature, notably within 12–30 °C at a rate of 0.70 g °C−1. This is primarily driven by the higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and frozen desserts. The magnitude of such impact is larger among households with lower income or educational levels. Our projections indicate a substantial nationwide increase in added sugar consumption of 2.99 g per day by 2095 (or equivalently 5 °C warming level), with vulnerable groups at an even higher risk.

This study addresses that gap through a content analysis of sustainability and annual reports from 75 of the largest companies across 8 sectors of the ocean economy. We examine which impacts are reported, how they are measured and whether firms set related targets. Most companies focus narrowly on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, with limited attention to more ocean-specific impacts, for which fewer than 25% of firms have metrics and targets. Where measurements are reported, the use of 443 distinct indicators limits comparability and suggests a lack of consensus on what should be disclosed. Amid growing demands for corporate accountability, our findings provide a timely benchmark to support the integration of ocean-specific considerations into reporting frameworks and to guide materiality assessments that better reflect the environmental realities of the ocean economy. Increasing transparency about firms’ reporting of environmental impacts is especially important in the context of a growing ocean economy. This study analyses the content of sustainability and annual reports from 75 of the largest companies across 8 sectors of the ocean economy."

 This paper investigates a crossover adjustment method for spaceborne GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) phase altimetry and demonstrates its capability for precise surface elevation mapping through a case study of Lake Ladoga, which is the largest lake in Europe and exhibits unmodeled gravitational effects on its water surface. GNSS-R phase altimetry measures relative surface height with a constant but unknown offset and may also include errors in the retrieved surface gradients due to factors such as the residual atmospheric propagation error after model correction. The crossover adjustment method estimates the offsets between multiple GNSS-R tracks and each track’s surface gradient errors by formulating and solving a constrained least-squares problem to minimize differences at intersections. Additionally, this method evaluates the accuracy of GNSS-R altimetry retrievals by comparing the consistency of each track with others, enabling the identification of measurement outliers with respect to stable geophysical features. In the case study, we utilize 871 sets of Spire grazing-angle GNSS-R data collected from 2020 to 2023, containing signals coherently reflected off Lake Ladoga, to map the unmodeled gravitational effects on the lake’s water surface. The mapping results are validated using 16 ICESat-2 altimetry datasets, demonstrating a high accuracy with a root-mean-square (RMS) difference of about 3 cm."

 Vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols has a significant impact on climate change, air quality, cloud-aerosol interactions, atmospheric remote sensing, and global transport. However, current aerosol layer height (ALH) retrieval algorithms, based on passive radiometry, are largely affected by surface reflectance, limiting their applicability to surface with low reflectance, for example, ocean and dark-target land surfaces. The Aerosol Single-scattering albedo and layer Height Estimation (ASHE) algorithm can be well adapted to both land and ocean, but it is strongly influenced by aerosol optical depth (AOD) uncertainty and requires estimation of expected aerosol-free radiation. In order to reduce the effects of AOD uncertainty and to simplify the method, a UV band difference quotient coefficient (UVD) method is developed in this study. First, in the retrieval process, UV aerosol index (UVAI), AOD, and Ångström exponent (AE) are incorporated to perform cloud screening and aerosol type classification (distinguishing between smoke and dust). Next, utilizing the high sensitivity of Rayleigh scattering and the wavelength dependence of aerosol absorption, the logarithmic difference of UV dual-band normalized radiance lnr340−lnr378 is used to capture and amplify the impact of ALH on radiance differences. By incorporating the normalization effect of the two-band difference r340−r378, the effects from AOD uncertainty are partially offset, resulting in a monotonic, stable, and sensitive response of the UVD to the ALH. Finally, lookup tables (LUTs) for smoke and dust aerosols are built to retrieve ALH. The UVD method was validated using CALIOP observations from a series of well-documented North American biomass burning events and Atlantic dust storms. The validation results indicate that the RMSE ranges from 0.67 to 1.42 km (mean: 0.99 km), while the bias varies between −0.62 and 0.57 km, with a correlation coefficient of 0.71. Additionally, the error distribution of UVD-CALIOP is concentrated within the range of −1 km to 1 km, with 75 % of the data points having an error within 1.13 km."

 Rivers are vital to Earth’s water cycle and human societies, yet their water quality is increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. While satellite remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for large-scale water quality monitoring across diverse aquatic ecosystems, a systematic analysis of water optical properties in rivers remains limited, restricting its use in supporting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) monitoring. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of water transparency (Secchi disk depth, ZSD) and color (Forel-Ule Index) in the five large rivers (Yangtze, Danube, Mississippi, Nile, and Amazon) using Sentinel-2 MSI data (2019–2021). Results reveal significant spatial-seasonal variations: Danube had the highest transparency (ZSD) and bluest color (FUI), followed by Nile, Yangtze, Mississippi, and Amazon. These differences were primarily driven by basin-specific soil erodibility and precipitation. Spatially, the Yangtze, Mississippi, and Amazon exhibited decreasing ZSD and increasing FUI from their upper to lower reaches, contrasting with different trends in Danube and Nile, highlighting the influence of large dams. Seasonally, two different patterns were observed in the five rivers, underscoring the hydrological influences on water optical properties. Furthermore, as two key optical water quality parameters, ZSD and FUI were analyzed for their complementary roles in characterizing river turbidity across varying water conditions. By quantifying spatiotemporal patterns, this study establishes a global baseline for river optical properties and supports SDG 6.3.2 monitoring. Our findings offer new insights into large-scale river ecosystem dynamics under environmental change."

 A total of 26 alternative and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were investigated in atmospheric particles collected above the offshore Eastern China Sea (OECS) during a research cruise from April 20 to May 18, 2018. The total concentrations of these 26 PFAS ranged from 35.59 to 1646.53 pg/m3, with an average of 316.79 pg/m3. The concentrations of short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) were significantly higher than those of long-chain PFCAs, with perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) being the dominant PFCA congener. PFBA was detected in all particle samples, accounting for 77.9 % of the total PFCAs, with an average concentration of 222.05 pg/m3. Moreover, perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) analogues showed lower concentrations and detection frequencies than PFCAs, possibly due to the ban on PFOS-related substances. Other PFAS congeners, such as fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (FTSAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), were detected at lower concentrations, possibly because they predominately exist in the gaseous phase. The levels of PFAS in atmospheric particles over the OECS were comparable or higher than those in other areas of China and abroad. The coast of Fujian Province and the Yangtze River estuary were two hot-spots for PFAS, mainly influenced by emission sources (various industrial and port transportation activities). In contrast, regions with low PFAS concentrations likely benefited from their geographical locations and meteorological factors, as inferred from backward trajectory analysis. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) modeling identified four primary sources of PFAS; electronic product manufacturing, PFOS-based products, aqueous film-forming foam extinguishing (AFFF) agent usage, and paper packing production. Among these, electronic product manufacturing and PFOS-based products contributed more of the PFAS in the PM2.5 particle samples. The estimated dry deposition of ΣPFAS ranged from 0.77 to 35.56 ng/m2/d, with an average value of 6.55 ng/m2/d. PFBA, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) were the dominant contributors. The total PFAS input into the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea via dry deposition in Spring was estimated to be about 518 kg and 328 kg, several times lower than the riverine input reported in previous studies. These findings clearly demonstrate that dry deposition is a significant pathway by which PFAS enter seawater and needs more attention."

 N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) is an essential additive in tire rubber compounds to enhance their lifespan. 6PPD quinone (6PPD-Q), a known toxic chemical, is formed through the oxidation of 6PPD. The formation of 6PPD-Q is expected to proceed via radical process, as the oxidation reaction necessarily involves an oxygen atom. However, due to the challenges in detecting radical species, many studies have inferred the formation of 6PPD-Q based on the neural oxidation products. In this study, the 6PPD oxidation products including radical intermediates were analyzed using direct atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). The formation of 6PPD-Q was elucidated by detecting its radical intermediates. The first ketone group in 6PPD-Q is formed through the rearrangement of (6PPD + O − H)• radical precursor. The second one is generated by the loss of a hydrogen atom from (6PPD + 2O − H)• radical precursor. The abundance of 6PPD-Q was significantly lower than those of other competing oxidation products. The primary competing reactions include the rearrangements of the two radical precursors into alternative species and the dissociations of 6PPD and oxidation products into nitrobenzene, formylaniline, 4-hydroxydiphenylamine, and 4-nitrodiphenylamine. The favorability of 6PPD-Q formation and its competing reactions was explained in terms of thermodynamics."

 Epidemiological evidence linked PM2.5 exposure to increased virus transmission, yet the impact of chemical composition of PM2.5 on viral susceptibility remains unclear. We characterized the constituents of water-soluble matters (WSM) in PM2.5 from urban Guangzhou and their association with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, inflammatory and antiviral responses in A549 cells. Chemical analysis revealed considerable variability in chemical composition across all samples, although all samples were dominated by inorganic ions (e.g., NO3−, SO42−, NH4+) and WSOM (e.g., lipids, oxy-aromatics), with metals constituted ∼1.2 %, primarily Cu, Fe, and Al. WSM exposure elevated viral infectivity (1.3–5.6-fold), IL-8 and TNF-α generation (1.2–5.2-fold), and suppressed IFN-β by 24 %–74 %, with minimal effects on IFN-α and surfactant proteins. An explainable machine learning analysis indicated that transition metals (e.g., Ni, V, Mn, Fe), inorganic ions (e.g., SO42−, Na+, K+), highly unsaturated oxy-aromatics (Xc ≥ 2.5, DBE ≥6) and protein1 with 0.2 < O/C ≤ 0.6 and 0.9 < H/C < 2.5 were positively linked to IL-8 and TNF-α induction, whereas trace metals (e.g., Cr, Al) and protein2 with 0.6 < O/C ≤ 1 and 1.2 < H/C < 2.5 were both associated with enhanced infectivity and IFN-β inhibition. Notably, viral infectivity remained uncorrelated with inflammatory cytokines but showed an inverse correlation with IFN-β expression consistently observed during WSM-only and WSM + virus co-exposure, suggesting that PM2.5 may impair interferon-mediated defenses to exacerbate viral susceptibility. Our study uncovers an overlooked health risk of PM2.5 thereby filling a critical gap in understanding the multifaceted health effect of PM2.5 exposure."

 Ammonia, a key alkaline gas in the atmosphere, plays a significant role in new particle formation and cloud condensation nuclei activity, particularly in marine environments. On islands rich in avian fauna, ammonia emissions often exceed those in urban areas and are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation. This study investigated the NH3 emissions on Heron Island in the Great Barrier Reef using three different methods, namely offline active sampling, offline passive sampling, and online nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometry (NO3-CIMS). The average NH3 mixing ratio of active sampling, passive sampling, and NO3-CIMS during the sampling period was 29 ± 23 ppb, 29 ± 22 ppb, and 39 ± 19 ppb. Results from the three methods revealed consistent NH3 mixing ratio trends. Changes in NH3 mixing ratio were highly correlated with precipitation events. During precipitation periods, the NH3 mixing ratio increased significantly within 30 min to a few hours after the rain started. Laboratory bird guano experiments further proved that NH3 emissions are more influenced by precipitation than temperature. Besides, the δ15N-NH3 values (−19.5 ‰ to −11.7 ‰) measured by passive samplers negatively correlated with NH3 levels, confirming seabird guano as the primary NH3 source. These findings highlighted the dynamic behavior of NH3 emissions and their sensitivity to environmental factors, shedding light on the potential importance of the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem for atmospheric processes relevant to aerosol formation."

 This study examines whether fine particulate matter (PM2.5) forecasts in New Delhi will continue to benefit from assimilation of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals in the same way as has been seen from assimilation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD assimilation. Three experiments were conducted with and without constraining aerosols initialization through assimilation of MODIS and VIIRS AOD retrievals in Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Satellite AOD assimilation significantly improves the agreement between modeled and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD at Kanpur with most of the changes in PM2.5 vertical distribution limited to altitudes below 5 km. Consequently, the assimilation of either MODIS or VIIRS AOD retrievals also reduces the mean bias in 72 h PM2.5 forecasts by 70–86 % and root mean squared error by 20–31 % with improvements of ∼200 μg/m3 during an acute air pollution episode in November 2017. However, the improvements due to VIIRS assimilation are slightly lower (0.5–3 %) than those due to MODIS assimilation. We conclude that VIIRS AOD can effectively replace MODIS in the operational air quality forecasting system after MODIS's end of life and can continue to support air quality management efforts in New Delhi."

 Oil and gas production increased dramatically last decade in the Bakken region, with accompanying changes to pollutant emissions and atmospheric concentrations. WRF-Chem model simulations of the Northern Great Plains were conducted comparing two emission scenarios using 2011 emissions to represent a baseline case with relatively low oil production (<0.4 million barrels per day) and 2014 emissions to represent a high production case (>1.0 million barrels per day). Assessment of model predictions from the baseline scenario against ground level meteorology and air quality measurements showed good overall agreement, demonstrating suitable model performance for assessing the effect of emissions changes on pollutant levels. In the high production scenario emissions of SO2 and NOx were lower across most of the domain (−80 % and −37 %, respectively), but were significantly higher in the Bakken region (+62 % for SO2 and +110 % for NOx), and changes in VOC emissions were also relatively higher in the Bakken. Simulated pollutant concentrations followed these emission changes, with average NOx levels decreasing for the high production scenario by 22 % in the overall domain, but increasing by 72 % in the Bakken. Predicted average O3 levels increased slightly by 0.2 % across the domain as NOx levels decreased, characteristic of VOC-limited conditions, with larger increases in urban areas where NOx reductions were greater. For the Bakken, simulations predict localized O3 decreases in the center of the region, but increases in downwind areas. Changes between the baseline and high production scenarios demonstrate the influence of oil and gas production associated emissions on pollutant concentrations."

 Secondary organic carbon (SOC) is a ubiquitous component of atmospheric fine particles but its spatial diversity at the city level has rarely been characterized. This study is the first of its kind that examine the spatial diversity of SOC at the city level, utilizing hourly carbon analyzer data of 2022 from four representative observation sites in the megacity of Guangzhou, China (GYQ, DXC, NSPZ and CHLK) encompassing urban, suburban, and rural areas. The minimum R-squared (MRS) method was adopted for SOC estimation. This study pioneers the use of explainable machine learning for SOC reconstruction with the CatBoost algorithm and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of input factors. The 12 input factors were grouped into four categories: photochemical reactions, aqueous-phase reactions, primary emissions, and meteorological conditions. Photochemical reactions dominate variations in SOC concentrations at urban and suburban sites. The annual average contribution of photochemical reactions gradually decreases from urban (∼50 %) to rural sites (∼30 %). The aqueous phase and meteorological conditions both contribute ∼20 % of SOC variations. Primary emissions contribution to SOC variations is less than 10 % for suburban and urban sites but the contribution increased to 33 % for the rural site. Further analysis suggests that the high contribution of primary emissions at the rural site reflects the influence of aged urban plumes. SOC at the suburban site is heavily influenced by shipping emissions due to its coastal location. SOC at the two urban sites exhibits different dependence on Non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) and O3 levels, which is related to the uneven influence of transported SOC at the two urban sites. SOC from local, regional, and background contributions was quantified at the urban site DXC using multiple-site observations. It was found that approximately 50 % of the SOC originated from outside Guangzhou city. This indicates that future efforts to control SOC may require a shift from relying solely on local mitigation measures to a more comprehensive approach that considers the spatial diversity of SOC for effective air quality management."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108458,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文探讨了中国云南地区春季对流层臭氧浓度升高的问题，重点关注了平流层入侵（SI）和生物质燃烧（BB）这两个关键因素的影响。研究利用AIRS卫星等多源观测数据，结合GEOS-Chem模型，分析了SI和BB对臭氧污染的贡献。研究发现，SI主要影响500 hPa以上的高空，而BB的跨境传输则影响850 hPa以下的低空。此外，BB的影响还导致臭氧前体物敏感性转变为VOC限制状态。这项研究对于理解西南地区臭氧污染的成因，以及制定有效的减排策略具有重要意义，与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['ozone', 'stratospheric intrusion', 'biomass burning', 'tropospheric ozone', 'AIRS satellite', 'GEOS-Chem', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition']",Yuheng Chen;Fei Qiu;Wen Chen;Wenxuan Fan;Anjie Yin;Mingya Xie;Puyu Lian;Kaihui Zhao,"Unraveling the role of stratospheric intrusion and biomass burning in springtime tropospheric ozone enhancement in Yunnan, China","•SI and BB transport are identified as two key transport processes modulating O3. •O3precursor sensitivity shifted to a VOC-limited regime under the influence of BB. •SI primarily influenced atmospheric levels above 500 hPa. •Cross-border transport of BB had a greater impact below 850 hPa. 
 Ozone (O3) pollution is particularly prevalent in spring and exhibits distinctive characteristics in southwestern China. Two significant natural sources contribute to O3 pollution: stratospheric intrusion (SI) and cross-border transport of biomass burning (BB) emissions from Southeast Asia. However, the roles of SI and BB in tropospheric O3 pollution in Southeast China remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated their distinct contributions during a typical SI event, using multi-source observations from AIRS satellite and surface samplers combined with the Goddard Earth Observing System coupled with chemistry (GEOS-Chem). SI and BB were identified as the key drivers of tropospheric O3 enhancement. The upper-level jet stream facilitated SI, while low-level jets, the subtropical high, and low-level troughs created favorable dynamic conditions for the cross-border transport of BB. SI primarily influenced altitudes above 500 hPa, contributing 11.3–40.0 ppb of O3. In comparison, BB transport reached as low as 850 hPa, with a positive contribution ranging from 8.5 to 11.6 ppb. Notably, O3 precursor sensitivity (OPS) rapidly shifted to a VOC-limited regime under the influence of BB. This study highlights the importance of adopting a dynamic emission reduction strategy tailored to varying OPS conditions during different O3 episodes. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in developing effective strategies to mitigate O3 pollution, considering the impacts of SI and BB."
