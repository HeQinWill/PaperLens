While numerous studies have identified elevated concentrations of certain emerging PFAS, the sources and environmental accumulation differences of many homologues remain insufficiently characterized. In this study, we employed suspect and nontarget screening to characterize both legacy and emerging PFAS across environmental matrices, including water, sediment, and soil, surrounding an industrial park with predominant perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) contamination. A total of 32 classes comprising 112 compounds were identified, including 80 emerging PFAS detected through the screening approach. In addition to PFCAs, emerging PFAS, including perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs), perfluoroalkyl alcohols (PFAs), and PFA derivatives, were frequently detected in the study area, primarily in water and sediment samples. In contrast, the contamination profile was less complicated in soil samples, where PFCAs were the predominant homologues. The median total concentrations of target PFAS in water, sediment, and soil samples were 427 ng/L, 4.17 ng/g of dw, and 3.92 ng/g of dw, respectively. Predicted risk assessment further indicated that these emerging PFAS with high concentrations pose non-negligible risks to both ecological and human health, underscoring the need for further investigation into their potential impacts."

Existing assessments fail to account for plant-level heterogeneity in production routes and geographic settings─critical determinants of health impacts─hindering the formulation of targeted decarbonization strategies that maximize health gains. Here, by integrating a facility-level emission inventory with inverse atmospheric modeling, we estimate that the Chinese ISI emits 1.56 Pg of CO2 and 0.85 Tg of PM2.5 annually, with 147,000 (IQR: 121,000–184,000) annual PM2.5-attributable premature deaths linked to ISI emissions, and the health burdens varying by 77,500-fold across individual plants. Blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) processes impose 3.8 times higher mortality intensity than electric arc furnaces (EAFs) (172 vs 45 deaths per 1000 Gg steel produced), with 80% of mortality concentrated in 21% of plants─predominantly large BF-BOF complexes in densely populated eastern China. Strategically relocating 30 Tg eastern BF-BOF capacity (3.6% of the national total) to scrap-based EAFs in low-carbon southwestern power grids could prevent 12,300 (IQR: 9500–16,100) annual deaths (8.4% reduction), generating USD 24.5 (IQR: 20.0–30.4) billion in combined climate-health benefits. Natural gas-based direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) integration offers a scrap-independent alternative, achieving ∼50% lower mortality than BF-BOF. These findings advance targeted strategies to optimize health outcomes during ISI decarbonization in China."

While the oxidative potential of DMSe-derived aerosols has been shown to be greater compared to that of ambient aerosols from various sources, the role of selenium (Se) in processes governing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production remains unclear. Utilizing dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as a chemical analogue and mechanistic control of DMSe, we detected, quantified, and contrasted ROS produced by DMSe- and DMS-derived aerosols in aqueous solutions and confirmed the changes in Se oxidation state after dissolution. DMSe- and DMS-derived aerosols produced 9.0 ± 2.1 nmol ·OH/μg-aerosol and 0.29 nmol ± 0.11 ·OH/μg-aerosol, respectively. The average 33-fold difference in ·OH produced in these systems implies different dominating mechanisms of formation. DMS-derived aerosols can generate ·OH through organic hydroperoxide decomposition, whereas DMSe-derived aerosols are additionally capable of producing ·OH through Fenton-like reactions by cycling among Se(0), Se(IV), and Se(VI). Selenate (SeO42–), selenite (SeO32–), selenium dioxide (SeO2), and methane seleninic acid (CH4O2Se) were redox-active compounds confirmed within DMSe-derived aerosols. This study highlights the redox cycling of particulate Se and the production of aqueous ·OH, which have important implications for atmospheric aqueous chemistry and Se biogeochemical cycles."

Ruby;F. McNab;T. F. Schildgen;A. D. Wickert;V. M. Fernandes,"How Sediment Supply, Sea‐Level, and Glacial Isostatic Oscillations Drive Alluvial River Long‐Profile Evolution and Terrace Formation","For over a century, alluvial river terraces have been used as archives of tectonic deformation or changes in water discharge, sediment supply, and sea level. Despite this long history, such efforts remain challenging: using terraces as deformation markers requires knowledge of their initial geometry, and most attempts to attribute terrace formation to paleoclimate forcing rely on qualitative comparisons between paleoclimate archives and terrace ages. We illustrate how simulating alluvial valley profiles and terrace formation can substantially improve such analyses. We apply a physically‐derived model of alluvial river long profiles to the Río Santa Cruz, a glacially‐fed river in Patagonia with extensive terraces. To explore how different geomorphic drivers affect terrace formation, we impose (a) sinusoidal changes in the input sediment‐to‐water discharge ratio, (b) sediment pulses, (c) sinusoidal surface uplift and subsidence simulating glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), and (d) sea‐level variations. Each forcing mechanism generates distinct terrace geometries and lag‐time distributions, with the river response time relative to the forcing timescale influencing both. We test which terrace‐formation drivers are most likely to have generated the terraces along the Río Santa Cruz, whose response time is considerably longer than timescales of glacial–interglacial cycles. Our results reveal complex patterns of incision and aggradation, including destructive signal interference leading to terrace‐formation gaps. Although terrace profiles may remain non‐unique, when combined with a quantitative understanding of alluvial river processes, they represent a powerful archive of diverse Earth‐system processes, including variations in water and sediment supply, sea‐level change, GIA, tectonic deformation and mantle dynamics."

Maloney,A Numerical Case Study of the Papagayo Jet Effect on East Pacific Easterly Wave Development,"This study investigates the development of an east Pacific easterly wave (EW) event in August 2019 and the effect of the Papagayo jet on its evolution. Convective‐permitting numerical simulations were conducted. These included a control experiment and a Gap‐Filled experiment with a closed mountain gap near the Gulf of Papagayo, to test the effect of a weaker Papagayo jet on this EW event. The initial disturbance developed into a mesoscale convective system in the Panama Bight and transitioned into an EW in the Papagayo jet exit region, both of which are reasonably captured in the control experiment. The weakened Papagayo jet in the Gap‐Filled experiment reduces the meridional shear of the zonal wind and the associated barotropic energy extraction from the mean flow. This results in significantly weakened upward motion and vertical stretching near the center of the disturbance, thus weakening vorticity particularly at low levels below 700‐hPa in the jet region. The weaker Papagayo jet and diminished low‐level vorticity in the Gap‐Filled experiment can further limit the subsequent EW vorticity intensity as it travels northwest along the Mexican coast. However, the Papagayo jet appears to have a limited impact on the horizontal vorticity structure and propagation of the EW disturbance. These results suggest that the broad‐scale monsoonal westerlies south of the Papagayo jet may help maintain the low‐level horizontal wind shear, even when the Papagayo jet is weakened, thereby contributing to the formation of the EW's tilted vorticity structure."

However, common land surface models (LSMs) overlook salinity effects on ET, contributing to uncertainties in simulating land–atmosphere interactions and climate processes, particularly in the coastal regions. In this study, the Noah‐MP LSM was enhanced to incorporate the effects of soil salinity. Using half‐hourly meteorological forcing data and observed soil properties and salinity from the Dongtan coastal wetland in Shanghai (July–December 2023), we evaluated model performance before and after this improvement. Comparisons with in situ observations show that incorporating salinity significantly reduces the model's overestimation of latent heat flux—by up to 90 W/m2 during the cold season—and decreases cumulative ET bias by as much as 130 mm, with the error rate reduced by approximately 33%. This improvement is largely attributed to salinity constraints on soil evaporation under sparse vegetation conditions. These findings highlight salinity as a key regulatory factor in wetland hydrothermal dynamics and offer a promising approach to improving LSM accuracy in coastal wetland environments."

The combined effects of temperature and salinity on soil GHG emissions still remain unclear. This study integrated in situ monitoring and laboratory‐controlled incubation to quantify the fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the salt marsh (Phragmites australis) soils in the Yangtze River Estuary, in response to temperature and salinity variations. The results demonstrated that warming magnified the influence of salinity, elevating the salinity threshold for GHG emissions, while at low temperatures (<20°C), emissions remained unaffected by salinity. At low salinity (0–4 ppt), temperature significantly stimulated emissions, whereas higher salinity suppressed them. Nevertheless, at elevated salinity, soil respiration becomes more temperature‐sensitive, indicating heightened microbial activity under favorable thermal conditions. Soil temperature was identified by the random forest model as the dominant control on GHG emissions than salinity, with 25°C and 5 ppt identified as tipping points for temperature and salinity. Under SLR scenarios of 0.5, 1, and 2 m, GHG fluxes from the Yangtze River Estuary wetlands exhibited a slight decline in emissions with moderate salinity increases, but emissions intensify under more extreme SLR scenarios. This study underscores the combined impact of global warming, SLR, and saltwater intrusion on coastal GHG emissions, highlighting the potential reduction in the effectiveness of carbon sequestration by salt marshes. The findings offer valuable insights for evaluating future blue carbon dynamics under global change."

Here, the authors discover that the GluA4 AMPA receptor subunit has distinct structural properties and conformational plasticity that tune its activation to glutamate. 
 AMPA-subtype glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPAR ion channels exhibit multiple subconductance states that tune neuronal responses to glutamate. GluA4 is the rarest subunit in the brain but is enriched in interneurons and the cerebellum. Rising evidence points to GluA4 AMPARs in the development of neurological diseases, but the structural mechanisms of GluA4 function remain enigmatic. Here, we show the distinct features of GluA4 that tune AMPAR function. We find that GluA4 AMPARs have a canonical “Y” shaped architecture where local dimer pairs are domain-swapped between the amino terminal domain (NTD) and ligand binding domain (LBD), both of which comprise the extracellular domain. All four LBDs are glutamate bound yet open the GluA4 ion channel by asymmetric hinging in all four channel helices. We observe that the glutamate-saturated LBD has conformational plasticity, which tunes the ion channel gate below. These data provide a framework for understanding channel subconductance, outline the distinct properties of GluA4, expand our understanding of conformational plasticity in AMPARs, and will inform therapeutic design. Fast excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by AMPA receptors. Here, the authors discover that the GluA4 AMPA receptor subunit has distinct structural properties and conformational plasticity that tune its activation to glutamate."

Consequently, a bulk electrical conductivity of > 110 % IACS is obtained in copper at room temperature. 
 High electrical conductivity is crucial for electrics, electronics, communications. Eliminating defects such as grain boundaries and impurities is a primary approach to enhancing electrical conductivity in metals. Although reducing electron-phonon interaction can further contribute to electrical conductivity, only a marginal enhancement is obtained by imposing external pressure even high up to gigapascal. Here we report a contrary strategy to transforming defects into conductive benefits, by forming abundant defects of severely distorted lattice via heterogeneous interface-assisted plastic deformation in metal (copper). Such lattice distortions are generated under a non-extreme condition, and cause internal giant local stress significantly suppressing electron-phonon coupling and thus reducing phonon-caused electron scattering. Consequently, a striking bulk electrical conductivity of > 110% IACS is obtained in the copper at room temperature, which is equivalent to the effect of an external high pressure of about 10 gigapascals. Our work provides an extendable approach for developing high-performance metal conductors. Giant local stress was formed by introducing heterogeneous interfaces, thus suppressing electron-phonon coupling and reducing electron scattering. Consequently, a bulk electrical conductivity of > 110 % IACS is obtained in copper at room temperature."

Here, the authors identify an interaction between the condensin and the mediator complexes. Its disruption disturbs mitotic gene expression, chromatin domain formation, and chromosome segregation. 
 Condensin organizes eukaryotic genomes into three-dimensional (3D) chromosome architectures that support accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this organization remain unclear. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized interaction between the condensin subunit Cnd1 and the mediator subunit Pmc4 in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We characterize a condensin mutation, cnd1-K658E, which disrupts this interaction and observe that it impairs the formation of condensin-mediated chromatin domains during mitosis, resulting in chromosome segregation defects. This condensin-mediator interaction facilitates condensin recruitment to highly transcribed genes and mitotically activated genes, the latter of which demarcate condensin-mediated domains. Moreover, 1,6-hexanediol treatment and Pmc4 mediator depletion impair expression of mitotically activated genes, diminish condensin enrichment at those boundary genes, and disrupt domain boundaries, suggesting that mediator contributes to mitotic gene expression and chromosome architecture via phase separation. Together, these results reveal a mechanism by which mitotic gene expression patterns shape condensin-mediated chromosome architecture to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. Accurate chromosome segregation relies on three-dimensional genome organization, yet its molecular basis remains unclear. Here, the authors identify an interaction between the condensin and the mediator complexes. Its disruption disturbs mitotic gene expression, chromatin domain formation, and chromosome segregation."

These findings support bidirectional, neurally-controlled prosthetic systems. 
 Limb loss causes severe sensorimotor deficits and often necessitates prosthetic devices, particularly in lower-limb amputees. Although direct neural recording from residual nerves offers a biomimetic route for prosthetic control, low signal amplitudes and challenges in nerve interfacing have limited adoption. Intraneural multichannel electrodes provide a potential solution by enabling access to motor signals from muscles lost after amputation. Here, we report intraneural recordings from two transfemoral amputees using transversal intrafascicular multichannel electrodes implanted in distal branches of the sciatic nerve. We identified multiunit activity associated with volitional phantom movements of the knee, ankle, and toes, exhibiting joint- and direction-specific modulation distributed across electrodes. A Spiking Neural Network–based decoder outperformed conventional methods in predicting attempted movements, with further gains achieved by integrating intraneural and intermuscular signals. Motor and sensory maps showed minimal overlap, indicating early segregation within the sciatic nerve. These findings pave the way for bidirectional, neurally-controlled prosthetic systems.

Here, the authors combine metagenomic mining with machine learning to map and predict PAM specificities across thousands of Cas9 enzymes, expanding the genomic target space. 
 Recognition of protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) is crucial for target site recognition by CRISPR–Cas systems. In genome editing applications, the requirement for specific PAM sequences at the target locus imposes substantial constraints, driving efforts to search for novel Cas9 orthologs with extended or alternative PAM compatibilities. Here, we present CRISPR-PAMdb, a comprehensive and publicly accessible database compiling Cas9 protein sequences from 3.8 million bacterial and archaeal genomes and PAM profiles from 7.4 million phage and plasmid sequences. Through spacer–protospacer alignment, we infer consensus PAM preferences for 8003 unique Cas9 clusters. To extend PAM discovery beyond traditional alignment-based approaches, we develop CICERO, a machine learning model predicting PAM preferences directly from Cas9 protein sequences. Built on the ESM2 protein language model and trained on the CRISPR–PAMdb database, CICERO achieves an average cosine similarity of 0.69 on test data and 0.75 on experimentally validated Cas9 orthologs. For Cas9 clusters where alignment-based predictions are infeasible, CICERO generates PAM profiles for an additional 50,308 Cas9 proteins, including 17,453 high-confidence predictions with CICERO confidence scores above 0.8. Together, CRISPR–PAMdb and CICERO enable large-scale exploration of PAM diversity across Cas9 proteins, accelerating design of next-generation CRISPR-Cas9 tools for precise genome engineering.

 Transcription factors (TFs) search for and bind specific DNA target sites to control gene expression. However, eukaryotic TF target search within the chromatinized genome is poorly characterized. Here, we combine in vivo and in vitro single-molecule imaging to dissect the role of differentially-charged DNA-binding domain flanking regions in the target search of Sox TFs. We demonstrate that the flanking region of Sox2 markedly enhances search efficiency compared to the negatively-charged flanking region of Sox17. The involved mechanisms are distinct for naked DNA compared to chromatin. On DNA, the enhanced search of Sox2 is driven by an increased target recognition rate during 1D sliding, despite reduced sliding speed. Conversely, enhanced nonspecific interactions between the Sox2’s DNA-binding domain flanking region and nucleosomes facilitate binding to compact chromatin and reinforce pioneer activity. These findings provide critical insights into biophysical mechanisms governing TF target search within the chromatinized genome. This work describes how positive charge in the peptide chain flanking the DNA-binding domain of transcription factors speeds up their search on free and chromatinized DNA, helping to explain why some transcription factors act as stronger pioneers."

Steiner,Advancing airborne pollen mapping with integrated ground and satellite observations,"•Developed an ML framework using satellite data to map pollen at continental scale. •Added aerosol optical properties to improve pollen concentration estimates. •Provided a novel method to determine pollen season onset over broad regions. 
 Pollen in the atmosphere can affect the Earth's climate by impacting cloud formation and can harm human health by triggering respiratory diseases such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma. However, the current understanding of atmospheric pollen is limited by sparse observational data. To address this gap, we integrate spaceborne aerosol optical properties with meteorological and phenological data in a machine learning framework to estimate atmospheric pollen concentrations and composition across the continental United States. The model is based on a random forest algorithm trained using multi-year observations from 40 airborne pollen monitoring stations. Model performance is evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation using three metrics designed to assess mean concentration (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error, SMAPE), peak intensity (Normalized Average Range difference, NAR), and interannual variability (Normalized Average Interquartile Range difference, NAIQR). The model performs best in regions with dense observational coverage, particularly the northeastern and southeastern U.S.; for example, the average SMAPE for Poaceae in these regions is 0.40, compared to 0.56 in other regions. Our results also suggest that satellite-observed aerosol optical properties significantly improve model performance. Compared to models without optical inputs, our integrated approach achieves up to a 130% improvement in NAR and NAIQR for key taxa such as Ambrosia, Pinaceae, Populus, Ulmus, and Betula. This novel approach provides a consistent and comprehensive data-driven mapping of pollen concentrations, with the potential to extend predictive capability into regions lacking historical observations. Our results demonstrate that model performance improves largely when even limited local data are available for pre-training. This work advances our understanding of pollen distributions in data-sparse regions and provides a valuable tool for climate, ecosystem, and public health research."

 The North China Plain (NCP) faced severe summer ozone pollution in 2023, exacerbating risks to public health and crop yield. Accurate county-level ozone source attribution is essential for precise air quality management, yet conventional city-scale source modeling often overlooks heterogeneity in intra-urban contributions. Here, the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS), coupled with an online tracer-tagging module, was employed to quantify ozone sources and crop impacts, successfully reproducing spatiotemporal ozone variations across the NCP. The results showed that regional transport dominated summer ozone formation; emissions within 200 km contributed 43%–49% to the site-averaged maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3, rising to 77%–91% at the 800 km scale. Local priority control zones shifted substantially when evaluated against site-average, site-maximum, and maximum population-weighted metrics. Notably, Beijing's maximum noontime ozone peaks (MNP) differ distinctly from MDA8 O3: local emissions contribute 44% to MNP versus 26% to MDA8 O3, whereas 200–500 km transport dominates MNP in Zhengzhou and 500–800 km transport in Shijiazhuang, reflecting intensified midday photochemistry and precursor transport. Furthermore, AOT40-based assessments estimate 21% relative maize yield losses (RYL) across the NCP, primarily attributable to regional transport. In Beijing, local emissions contribute 22% to maize RYL, with urban sources accounting for 26% of local emission-induced RYL. These findings underscore the need for coordinated regional controls to curb long-range ozone transport alongside localized precision interventions, providing a scientific basis for integrated air quality and agricultural management."

 Compound dry-hot events (CDH) are escalating climate hazards in China. This study examines spatiotemporal changes in the frequency, duration, dryness severity, and extreme heat characteristics of CDH using high-resolution daily data, including the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and daily maximum temperatures, from 1962 to 2022. Using high-resolution daily data (1962–2022) and a conditional Copula-based framework to calculate a risk amplification ratio (RAR), we analyzed daily CDH events nationwide. Our key results show: (1) a significant increase in the frequency and spatial extent of drought-related heatwaves, especially in recent decades; (2) intensifying CDH events, with annual durations extending by 1.8–3.6 days and severity rising by 2–9 units per event; and (3) drought amplifying concurrent heatwave risks by 3–7 times across most regions, which underscored regionally amplified impacts, particularly in China's arid regions, largely driven by anthropogenic climate change. The analysis, further validated by employing two distinct data products, indicates that background aridity critically modulates both CDH spatiotemporal characteristics and the magnitude of drought-induced heatwave risk amplification. By leveraging daily-scale data and a novel probabilistic framework, this research enhances the mechanistic understanding of compound event dynamics and underscores the necessity of accounting for drought as a key triggering factor in climate risk assessments."

 Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are subject to inherent limitations such as insufficient resolution and systematic biases, which present formidable challenges for regional precipitation forecasting. High-precision precipitation forecasting is crucial for regional flood prevention and urban flood risk reduction. This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework (DualTransBU-Net-P), integrating spatial self-attention. This framework incorporates a core downscaling-bias correction model (DualTransBU-Net), a post-processing optimization module for extreme precipitation, and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for interpretability. It performs end-to-end joint downscaling and bias correction on Global Forecast System (GFS) precipitation forecast data by integrating multi-source data. The results show that compared to existing models, the proposed architecture significantly enhances GFS precipitation forecast accuracy, improving resolution from 0.25° to 0.025°. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the test set is reduced by 4.6% to 18.7%, and the fair threat score (ETS) is improved by an average of 43.9%. Among 437 heavy-precipitation day samples, RMSE decreased for 412 samples (94.3%). The ETS under the extreme precipitation threshold (>10 mm d−1) increased by 50.6% to 63.1%. Furthermore, the model's performance remained high during the seasonal analysis, demonstrating strong seasonal generalization. Interpretability analysis revealed distinct decision-making mechanisms of the deep learning model during heavy precipitation under typhoon and non-typhoon conditions, with different underlying physical factors controlling these mechanisms. The combination of a self-attention mechanism and interpretable deep learning provides an effective approach for refined precipitation forecasting."

 The Italian Peninsula's climate is highly influenced by its complex topography and diverse regional weather systems, making high-resolution seasonal forecasting crucial for many societal sectors. Traditional seasonal prediction models, such as the CMCC SPSv3.5 (SPS), provide valuable insights but lack the spatial resolution necessary to capture local-scale climatic details. Thus, this study aims to provide a high-resolution seasonal forecast over Italy by enhancing SPS through statistical downscaling (SD) techniques tailored to the region's demand for finer-scale climate information. The SD method involves a three-step process that utilises observational datasets (ERA5 and CHIRPS) at 1/4° horizontal resolution and two machine-learning methods based on Empirical Quantile Mapping (EQM) and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), translating 1° SPS forecasts into high-resolution fields by matching predicted conditions to observed patterns. Both SD methods were cross-validated over the 24-year hindcast period available (1993–2016), and the results indicate significantly enhanced seasonal predictions for the Italian Peninsula, with biases about 5–6 times smaller than those of the original SPS. The main component of this improvement is spatial accuracy, which allows the identification of domain characteristics that are unnoticed in SPS. The bias evaluated by lead time, key for seasonal forecasts, showed accuracy declining from lead month 1 onward. For instance, the 2 m temperature bias increased from −0.14/−0.31/−0.85 °C in lead month 1 to −0.68/−0.71/−1.41 °C in lead month 6 (kNN/EQM/SPS), highlighting the challenge of maintaining predictive skill and the need for adaptive correction strategies to enhance lead-time reliability. Combining SD techniques with SPS outputs offers a solution for high-resolution seasonal predictions, supporting climate-sensitive applications by reducing forecast bias and improving spatial accuracy."

 This study investigates the accuracy of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) forecasts and analyses during a whole year, by assimilating AOT retrievals from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) into the aerosol-coupled Non-hydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model. We explore the impact of data assimilation on aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE), taking into account the interactions between aerosol particles and radiation. Evaluation against the assimilated MODIS AOT data shows an improvement in the AOT fields. The root mean square error (RMSE) dropped from 0.027 in the free-run to 0.018 (a 33% reduction) for the forecast and to 0.017 (a 37% reduction) for the analysis, while the correlation coefficient rose from 0.640 (free-run) to 0.911 (forecast) and 0.986 (analysis), respectively. Furthermore, the most significant improvements were observed during the peak biomass burning period from August to October. This enhanced performance is further certified independently by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, which show a reduction in RMSE from 0.050 (free-run) to 0.038 (forecast) and 0.040 (analysis), alongside a marked rise in correlation coefficient to 0.810 and 0.884, respectively.

Under all-sky conditions, aerosol DRE are influenced by clouds, the forecast DRE under all-sky condition at the TOA is −1.45 ± 1.26 W/m2 and at the surface is −2.74 ± 1.98 W/m2."
