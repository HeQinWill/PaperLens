We introduce a framework combining degree-days (D°) and chemical activity to disentangle physiological and chemical drivers of toxicity. This approach was tested using Daphnia magna exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Two exposure designs were compared: (1) fixed duration (72 h) at 20 and 25 °C, and (2) D°-standardized exposure corresponding to 60 D° (72 h at 20 °C; 58 h at 25 °C). Chemical activity, a thermodynamic measure of bioavailable dose, was used as the exposure metric, with the median lethal activity (La50) as the primary endpoint. To provide a more nuanced view of the metabolism, sublethal responses (δ13C, C/N ratio, protein content) were also evaluated. In fixed-time exposures, La50 values were lower at 25 °C, indicating  greater apparent toxicity at elevated temperature. This difference disappeared under D° normalization, showing that increased mortality reflected faster physiological aging rather than altered PAH behavior. Metabolic indicators supported this interpretation, revealing PAH-driven, temperature-independent energy depletion. By aligning exposure with cumulative thermal experience and quantifying dose as chemical activity, this framework enables temperature-normalized toxicity assessment and supports climate-aware ecological risk evaluation for HOCs."

Fires at the WUI are therefore more common, and structural materials make up more of the wildfire fuel mass. While emissions from biomass fires are fairly well understood, volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from structural fires are less constrained. In this study, we perform measurements of VOC emissions from small-scale laboratory burns of 18 different structural materials across 78 experiments using a Vocus proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) to better understand these unique emissions. We calculate emission factors for 73 VOCs across all materials, including aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We compare the emissions from both flaming and pyrolysis, which separate the processes of direct release of VOCs from combustion formation. Mass spectra comparisons were used to qualitatively highlight high-emission compounds across materials and identify notable emissions (e.g., nylon monomers) and potential tracers (e.g., halogen species) for WUI fires. Using these data, the emissions from a whole-house fire were compared with those from an equivalent mass of wood, and we found that some aromatic and nitrile species may be suitable WUI fire tracers."

Yeung,Elucidating Unknown Organofluorine in Municipal Wastewater: A Mass Balance Approach including Fluorinated Pharmaceuticals,"Previous studies on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have indicated large amounts of unidentified organofluorine in municipal wastewater, raising concerns about their environmental impact. Here, a novel multisorbent solid phase extraction method was applied to municipal wastewater samples, followed by liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry-based screening and a quantification workflow combining targeted analysis and combustion ion chromatography for fluorine mass balance analysis. Twenty-three highly fluorinated compounds (i.e., perfluoroalkyl acids and precursors) were identified and, apart from trifluoroacetic acid, quantified in the low- to sub-ppt range. In contrast, 30 low-fluorinated substances (i.e., active pharmaceutical ingredients, pesticides, and transformation products, including some previously unreported metabolites) were identified and quantified at concentrations up to 3 orders of magnitude higher. Despite their lower fluorine content (<30% by mass), these pharmaceuticals accounted for 28–42% of the extractable (organo)fluorine (EOF), with sitagliptin, bicalutamide, and celecoxib carboxylic acid being important drivers of the EOF. The inorganic fluoroanions hexafluorophosphate and tetrafluoroborate were coextracted and contributed 7–19% of the EOF. The multisorbent approach also captured polar cationic pharmaceuticals, substantially influencing the EOF composition. These findings highlight the complexity of fluorine mass balance in municipal wastewater and the need for advanced methods to uncover unidentified organofluorine."

Recent ERW literature has highlighted potential co-benefits from cropland ERW application, including reduced fertilizer requirements and soil N2O emissions. However, contributions of co-benefits to life cycle environmental impacts remain poorly understood, and methodologies for integrating them into environmental and cost assessments are lacking. We address these research gaps by integrating co-benefits into a coupled life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis to quantify environmental impacts and costs of ERW with and without co-benefits. We assess both waste and virgin rock sourcing and transportation pathways in the United States. Our results show that cradle-to-farm-gate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of ERW, with long-range transport allowing nationwide deployment, range from 44 to 371 kg CO2eq/t CO2eq removal, and costs vary between US$123 and US$926/net t CO2eq removal, depending on rock type, sourcing, and transport mix. Fertilizer and N2O co-benefits can reduce GHG emissions of ERW deployment by 10.4–55.7%, costs by 3.2–7.6%, and other environmental impacts by 1–147%. The contributions of co-benefits are region-dependent, demonstrated by our spatial analysis of croplands across the United States. Our framework presents methodological advancement for CDR assessments and supports future deployment of ERW."

Brackish water, rich in sulfate (SO42–), offers a potential alternative for CH4 mitigation. However, its effectiveness and dominant mechanisms across different coastal land uses remain unclear, hindering broader application. Here, we conducted a four-month incubation experiment using intact soil cores from eight drained coastal peatlands representing four land-use types: grass-cut, grass-graze, arable, and unmanaged. We assessed CH4 emissions from soils rewetted with either natural brackish water (SO42– = 392 ± 2 mg L–1) or synthetic water containing 0% (simulating freshwater), 50%, or 100% of the natural SO42– concentration. Results showed that natural brackish water significantly suppressed CH4 emissions by ∼90% compared to freshwater, with stronger suppression in grass-cut, arable, and unmanaged soils, but limited effects in grass-graze sites. Such differences were attributed to land-use-induced soil variations, where higher pH and lower methanogen relative abundance enhanced suppression. Mechanistically, natural brackish water primarily suppressed CH4 via physiological inhibition of methanogens (likely through salt stress and hydrogen sulfide toxicity). This effect persisted after SO42– reduction inhibition (day 90) and lasted until the end of incubation, reflecting resilience to short-term SO42– depletion. Our study advances understanding of CH4 dynamics and informs targeted use of brackish water rewetting for CH4 mitigation in coastal peatlands."

Durham;Bikash Sapkota;Yanna Chen;Jared L. Anderson,Ion-Specific Precipitation of Extractants Enables Rare-Earth Separation and Wastewater Remediation from Solvent Extraction of Critical Elements,"The increasing demand for rare-earth elements (REEs) necessitates sustainable recovery strategies, particularly from secondary sources, such as electronic waste. Solvent extraction is the primary industrial method for REE separation; however, the unintentional dissolution of extractants into wastewater poses serious environmental risks, leading to organic contamination and process inefficiencies. Existing wastewater treatment methods struggle to remove these persistent pollutants, underscoring the need for innovative recovery approaches. Herein, we present a ligand-mediated precipitation strategy that simultaneously recovers REEs and removes dissolved extractants from solvent extraction wastewater. We show that residual extractants in the aqueous phase can selectively bind REEs, inducing their precipitation while leaving transition metals in solution. By integrating FTIR spectroscopy, EDS, XPS, EXAFS, and SAXS, we elucidate the mechanism of ion-specific precipitation and the local coordination environment of metal ions in the precipitate. Importantly, we demonstrate that the precipitated extractants can be efficiently recovered and reused, providing a closed-loop solution that enhances sustainability. Applying this method to leachates from samarium–cobalt (Sm–Co) and neodymium–iron–boron (NdFeB) mixed magnets, we achieve highly selective REE precipitation under mild conditions, demonstrating a scalable and cost-effective pathway for REE recovery, wastewater purification, and extractant recycling. By integrating element-specific ligand-mediated precipitation with extractant reuse, this work offers a transformative approach to REE separation that reduces the environmental impact while improving resource efficiency."

To address this issue, we developed an advanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) system featuring a novel bifunctional Co3O4/g-C3N4 (Co/CN) cathode that synergistically couples oxidative and reductive pathways to minimize chlorinated byproducts. The cathode simultaneously enables rapid H*-mediated dechlorination and the generation of H2O2, which then reacts with anodic free chlorine to form 1O2, reducing chlorinated byproducts significantly. The developed Chlorination-Dechlorination-Mineralization (PEC/Cl/H2O2–CDM) system demonstrated a 1.86- to 2.38-fold enhancement in TOC removal efficiency, a 46.3–58.0% reduction in energy consumption, and a substantial decrease in acute toxicity relative to conventional PEC systems. Theoretical calculations further revealed that reductive dechlorination effectively lowers the energy barrier, making the dechlorinated intermediates more susceptible to radical attacks. Moreover, this system demonstrated a broad-spectrum degradation capability and was cost-effective for landfill leachate treatment to meet discharge standards. Guided by mechanistic insights, this study develops an advanced PEC process that enables the efficient and greener mineralization of hypersaline organic wastewater."

Tarpeh,Operando Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy of Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction Intermediates,"Efficient electrochemical conversion of wastewater nitrate to sustainable ammonia requires comprehensive mechanistic understanding and stringent control over competing pathways among multiple aqueous nitrogen intermediates─a challenge that underscores the need for in situ and operando surface analyses of electrocatalysts. In this study, we describe scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)-based approaches to characterize the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) on Ti and Cu. These methods facilitate the assessment of catalytic activity, product selectivity, and surface-adsorbed intermediates. By combining tailored chronoamperometric protocols, we achieved operando visualization of NO3RR onset potentials (−0.35 V vs RHE for Ti and −0.16 V vs RHE for Cu) and verified potential-dependent nitrogen product distributions through stepwise quantification of ammonia, hydroxylamine, and nitrite. Furthermore, in situ surface interrogation SECM directly titrates surface-adsorbed H* and O*, revealing their coverage shifts under varying potentials and reaction times during the NO3RR and providing evidence for a hydrogen-mediated pathway on Ti. The methodology establishes a robust SECM-based platform for systematically benchmarking electrocatalyst performance and is readily applicable to the NO3RR on other catalysts and even other reactions that produce a complex array of intermediates."

Chow,Hourly PM2.5 Estimates across California from 2018 to 2023,"This study presents a new data set of hourly PM2.5 concentrations across California from 2018 to 2023 at a three-kilometer resolution. This data set was developed by assimilating observations from PurpleAir and the U.S. EPA Air Quality System monitors into wildfire smoke forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Smoke (HRRR-Smoke) model using the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational data assimilation framework. Archived forecasts of modeled wildfire smoke PM2.5 from HRRR-Smoke create the background field for assimilation, which is then corrected using surface observations of total PM2.5. The resulting reanalysis from GSI provides an estimate of total PM2.5 that minimizes error from both the observational and the model data. Validation results indicate strong performance, with monthly R2 values ranging from 0.73 to 0.91 across the six-year data set, comparable to other PM2.5 data sets. Case studies are presented for three major fire events, the 2018 Camp Fire, 2019 Kincade Fire, and 2020 Lightning Complex Fires to demonstrate the data set’s fidelity in resolving plume dynamics and local exposure patterns. Root-mean-squared error averaged over each month scales with average PM2.5 concentrations, resulting in a low error under typical conditions but higher absolute errors during extreme smoke events. This is the first long-term, hourly PM2.5 data set of its kind for California and enables the generation of subdaily exposure metrics, such as peak hourly concentrations, exceedance durations, and time-of-day exposure peaks. The novelty and strong validation of this data set make it a compelling resource for future studies on the impact and significance of subdaily PM2.5 exposure."

Berelson,Multimodal Approach for Assessing Emissions and Transport of Greenhouse Gases and Air Pollutants from the January 2025 Los Angeles Wildfires,"Wildfires are an increasingly dominant source of greenhouse gases and criteria air pollutants in urbanized regions. Continuing to refine quantifications of the atmospheric impacts of urban wildfires is an important goal to improve predictions of future events relevant to both the global carbon budget and public exposure. Here, we analyze the January 2025 Los Angeles (LA) wildfires by integrating satellite imaging, meteorological models, advection and diffusion models, and dense ground-level air quality observations from both low-cost sensors and reference-grade instruments. Focusing specifically on the Eaton fire, we demonstrate how its emissions were transported across LA, noting the rate of spread and the magnitude of pollutant enhancements achieved. We complement our measurements with bottom-up estimates of the carbon content lost from the fires and corroborate our approach through a Gaussian dispersion plume analysis. Our analyses indicate that the Eaton fire consisted of two distinct periods of burning which differentially consumed structures and vegetation, and our bottom-up budget and atmospheric observations agree that the combustion of structures released significantly more carbon than that of vegetation. During the period of most intense burning, emission rates of CO (CO2) were estimated to be approximately 21.2–37.6× (0.9–1.2×) greater than average daily anthropogenic contributions. Subsequent observational evidence of pollutant concentrations also highlights the outsized contribution of wildfire CO emissions, relative to normal conditions. The impact of wildfire emissions on fine particulate matter is then assessed through the lens of both primary emissions and potential secondary formation. Additionally, we note how spikes in methane concentrations point to wildfire-driven destruction of natural gas infrastructure. Together, these results demonstrate the value of our multimodal approach in elucidating a holistic picture of the consequences of urban wildfires with respect to public health and greenhouse gas emissions."

Using a novel combination of PTR-TOF-MS and FTIR in laboratory simulations, this study found that shifting AC operation from 16 to 26 °C triggers a rapid pulse release of key OCs, including acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, acetic acid, acrylic acid, and propionic acid. Concentrations surged within 5 min (e.g., acetic acid rose 11.06 ppbv), peaked around 12 min (19.20 ppbv), and stabilized after approximately 16 min. Total acetic acid emitted in the first 5 min was 736.18 μg. The primary sources were hydrophilic top coatings, whose VOC emission profiles correspond to operational odors under specific thermo-humidity conditions. Secondary sources included acrylic sealants, which released temperature-dependent acids such as acrylic acid, and filter modules, which partially reduced odors via adsorption. The underlying mechanism is described as “low-temperature condensation and enrichment followed by thermally-induced pulse release” driven by variations in the temperature and humidity. Subsequent optimization cut key VOCs within 5 min, achieving 100% propionic acid and 99.88% acetic acid reduction. This work elucidates the physics-driven origin of AC odors, paving the way for next-generation odor-free AC through source-control engineering."

The commercial kitchen underwent a ventilation intervention to improve the efficiency of the kitchen’s range hood and reduce fugitive cooking emissions into the building’s air. We assessed gas-phase organic compound levels before and after the ventilation intervention was installed via a hybrid targeted analysis and nontargeted positive matrix factorization (PMF) approach. None of the quantified target gas-phase organic compounds exceeded their occupational exposure thresholds before or after the ventilation intervention was installed. However, the behavior of compounds in and beyond this quantified target set was dynamic and complex with many measured species decreasing in intensity as the ventilation intervention was implemented but many also increasing. To understand the temporal patterns of these individual species and those from a nontargeted analysis across all measured gas-phase species, we investigated their indoor sources via PMF. The cooking-related factor, as identified via PMF, accounted for up to 72% of total measured PTR-MS ion signal during the highest intensity cooking time (11:00–15:00) with occupancy-related emissions contributing up to 38% of the total PTR-MS signal during this time. The cooking-related factor did not show a statistically significant change in signal during the ventilation intervention, suggesting the intervention was ultimately ineffective."

However, the effects of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant doses of TCDF on adipose tissues and obesity remain elusive. This study revealed that adult mice exposed to 0.3 or 3 μg/kg of TCDF for 16 weeks developed mild adiposity under normal chow diets in a dose-dependent manner, which was evidenced by significant accumulation of epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) and inguinal white adipose tissues (iWAT). Interestingly, the obesogenic effects of TCDF were dose-independent under western diets; low-dose TCDF exposure caused a more pronounced obesogenic effect and associated metabolic disorders. Consistent with the obesogenic effect, TCDF was further revealed to interfere with adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and thermogenesis in eWAT or iWAT. Moreover, our results pointed out that TCDF plays roles in obesity through AhR-dependent and AhR-independent manners. Taken together, these results showed the obesogenic effect of environmentally relevant doses of TCDF and elucidated that TCDF caused dysfunction of adipose tissues, which strongly supports that TCDF is an environmental obesogen and that more attention should be paid to the health risks of TCDF regarding obesity."

Sokol;Timothy M. Merlis;Stephan Fueglistaler,No “Wet Gets Wetter” in Kilometer‐Scale Mock‐Walker Circulations,"Many climate model simulations and limited observations indicate that regions of tropical ascent and precipitation contract in response to surface warming. This response has well‐studied implications for the width of the zonal‐ and annual‐mean Intertropical Convergence Zone, but its applicability to zonally asymmetric circulations such as the Pacific Walker circulation remains unknown. Here, we investigate the impact of warming on the area of large‐scale ascent in kilometer‐scale, mock‐Walker simulations with both fixed and interactive surface temperatures. Contrary to the “wet‐gets‐wetter” and “upped‐ante” paradigms of precipitation change, the simulations show a “wet‐gets‐drier” response to warming in which the ascent region becomes larger and, on average, drier. We attribute these changes to rapid circulation weakening, which limits the transport of moisture into the ascent region. To meet the growing moisture demand for precipitation, local evaporation within the ascent region must increase rapidly, and the ascent region expands to draw moisture from a larger surface area. We link the slowdown of the circulation to increases in gross moist stability driven by a previously unknown mechanism. Central to this mechanism are changes in the vertical structure of the circulation, which features two vertically stacked overturning cells reminiscent of some tropical convergence zones. These results challenge long‐held paradigms of tropical precipitation change and show that the vertical structure of tropical circulations can play a critical role in the hydrological response to warming."

Plants preferentially utilized NO3− (54 ± 18%) over Red‐N (46 ± 18%), despite NO3− was four times less than Red‐N in soils. Increased N deposition, rather than climates, was the main factor enhancing soil NO3− availability and plant NO3− uptake.

After rapid growth, the high‐frequency portion of the Pi2 waves and the Pi1 waves in a tailward region for pseudosubstorms are notably weaker and decrease faster than those for substorms.

Mass and isotopic balance models confirm that DOP can supply about 40%–100% of summer phosphorus demand while about 50% of fixed nitrogen partitions into DON. These findings demonstrate that seasonal DOM stoichiometric flexibility encode dynamic nutrient cycling, highlighting the fundamental role of DOM transformation in regulating ocean biogeochemical processes."

While certain trends have been observed in the satellite Chl‐a data, it remains uncertain whether the changes are attributable to climate warming, because the data is not long enough to separate the role of climate warming from natural variability. Here, using a deep‐learning model trained with an ensemble of 10 Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, we identified the climate‐warming signal in satellite‐derived global Chl‐a fields. By comparison, a null model trained on ESM simulations forced only by natural variability was unable to identify a warming signal, confirming the role of climate warming. The warming signal is primarily derived from the spatial pattern of global Chl‐a trends, and eastern and western boundary regions are most sensitive to warming. Our results explicitly reveal the ongoing climate‐warming effect on global marine phytoplankton this century."

Large,Representation of Surface Mixed‐Layer Eddies Affects the Large‐Scale Ventilation of the Global Ocean,"Surface mixed‐layer dynamics play a crucial role in modulating the climate as it is the oceanic layer that directly communicates with the atmosphere. The resolution of global ocean models is, however, often restricted to O(1/4°) $\mathcal{O}(1/4{}^{\circ})$; this is too coarse to adequately resolve mixed‐layer processes, and we depend on parametrizations. One of such parametrizations is the mixed‐layer eddy (MLE) parametrization. Here, we compare the performance of two MLE parametrizations [Fox‐Kemper et al. (2011, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2010.09.002 hereon BFF11) and Bodner et al.

Upon tuning, and diagnosing submesoscale‐permitting truth simulations, the MLE efficiency coefficient in BOD23 ranges between the values of 0.003–0.038, while 0.06 to 0.07 for BFF11. We find that the spatial distribution of mixed‐layer depth and ventilation of the abyssal ocean, using the ideal‐age tracer and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation as its proxy, are sensitive to the interaction between MLE parametrizations and ocean surface boundary‐layer mixing schemes."

Existing studies primarily attribute wintertime midlatitude near‐surface temperature variability to tropospheric large‐scale advection, assuming minimal land influence. However, nudging the model's circulation toward observations yields little improvement in wintertime temperature variance over Northern Hemisphere land, suggesting that land‐atmosphere interactions also warrant attention. We introduce a new scaling framework for temperature variance that incorporates local land‐atmosphere feedbacks. Comparing our framework to the mixing length approach—which links temperature variance to the meridional temperature gradient and air parcel displacement (mixing length)—shows that land‐atmosphere feedbacks are inherently embedded in the mixing length, a connection previously overlooked. Roles of land–atmosphere feedbacks are evaluated via model experiments with perturbed circulation, land, or both. We find that longwave radiative damping dominates temperature variance responses over meridional temperature gradient when both land and circulation are perturbed."

This study investigates salt precipitation and the clogging phenomenon in fractured micromodels under various injection conditions. Results indicate that precipitated salt may clog the gas injection channel and decrease the effective permeability. Pore‐scale observations reveal the correlation between salt forms and their impacts on injectivity. Aggregated salt grows toward the direction of gas inflow and exhibits negative impacts on injectivity, while bulk salt grows within residual brine and shows little impact on relative permeability. An increase in gas injection rate weakens the negative impacts of precipitated salt on injectivity due to the suppression of brine backflow and salt creeping along the wall surface of the channel. Results deepen the understanding of salt‐induced injectivity impairment in saline formations."

The model characterizes the interplay between convective transport and chemical reactions using two parameters: convective turnover time and the species' chemical lifetime. Using airborne measurements of 42 trace gases from the CONvective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics field campaign, we show that this model reproduces over 90% of the observed variability (R2 > 0.9) in the observed ratio of upper troposphere (UT) to boundary layer mixing ratio—the UT fraction—across the 42 species, with the UT fraction serving as an indicator of convective venting efficiency. A key insight is that this efficiency is well captured by the ratio of chemical lifetime to turnover time. The turnover times derived from the box model are consistent with the mean transit time from the Transit Time Distribution framework of earlier studies. This physically intuitive box model provides an observation‐based diagnostic for evaluating convective transport in global chemistry‐climate models and for improving our understanding of chemistry‐climate interactions."

Here, an ice core from Mont Blanc (French Alps) was analyzed to investigate the δ15N(NO3−) record over the past 1,000 years. Atmospheric isotopic fractionation, including gas‐particle partitioning, introduces a limited and quantifiable effect on δ15N(NO3−)—up to 2.4 ‰ in extreme cases. Thus, the glacially‐archived NO3− reliably reflects a record of Western European NOx emissions by comparing δ15N and concentrations of NO3−, and isotope–concentration mixing relationships (Keeling plot) with historical emission inventories. An increase in δ15N(NO3−) in the 1800s reflects the dominance of NOx emissions from coal combustion. During the 20th century, the δ15N(NO3−) value substantially decreased, from (4.7 ± 1.5) ‰ in 1900 to (−1.9 ± 1.4) ‰ in 1990, and Keeling plot interpretation attributes this decrease to increasing oil combustion emissions. Between 1750 and 2016, the ice core's δ15N(NO3−) record generally aligns with existing NOx inventories for Western Europe. However, during the early 20th‐century, low ice core δ15N(NO3−) values suggest that the inventories may have underestimated NOx emissions resulting from agriculture. Since 2000, the decreasing NO3− concentrations and δ15N(NO3−) values highlight the success of mitigation policies in reducing fossil fuel‐induced NOx emissions, albeit with a delay of 20 years relative to emission inventories, that can be attributed to gas‐particle partitioning and mis‐quantification of NOx sources.

Our findings indicate that climate and topography are the primary drivers of EMF. More importantly, over 66% of the study area is expected to experience a decline in EMF by the end of the twenty‐first century across various future climate scenarios. Under high‐emission scenarios in particular, EMF could be on an unsustainable trajectory, putting increased pressure on terrestrial ecosystems and exacerbating their degradation.

Here, the authors demonstrate a new method for creating liquid photonic-molecule microlasers that combine low lasing threshold and enhanced sensitivity, achieving biomolecular detection limit down to attoMolar level. 
 Droplet microlasers, as promising tools for biophotonics and biomedical sciences, have witnessed rapid advances due to their flexible reconfigurability, high sensitivity to stimuli, and label-free biosensing ability. However, designing these biosensors with simultaneously critical properties of low lasing threshold, high spectral purity, and ultimate sensitivity remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile strategy to build liquid photonic molecules (LPMs) that combine all these features in a single device. We find that through tailoring the spectral Vernier overlap in size-mismatched droplets, this device enables single-mode lasing with a low threshold of ~610 nJ mm−2. The LPM lasers are engineered for dynamic tunability using a molecular isomerization strategy, which induces spectral mode hopping and thus yields a nearly ten-fold enhancement in spectral sensitivity over single droplets. Moreover, by leveraging the self-referenced intensity response of the LPM lasing modes, we demonstrate a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in biomolecular sensing, with a detection limit of 30 aM and a dynamic range spanning nine orders of magnitude. Our work offers exciting prospects for bio-integrated liquid sensors in diverse applications. Droplet microlasers are emerging as powerful tools for label-free biosensing.

 Osteoarthritis (OA), characterised by cartilage destruction, is the most common degenerative joint disease. However, no effective disease-modifying OA therapy is currently available. Herein, we report orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) as a novel catabolic regulator of OA pathogenesis. NR0B2 expression was markedly downregulated in cartilage from patients with OA. Global or chondrocyte-specific Nr0b2 deletion in male mice exacerbated OA-related pain and structural changes following surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus, accompanied by increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-13 expression in chondrocytes. Conversely, adeno-associated virus-mediated Nr0b2 overexpression in knee joints of male mice protected against accelerated knee OA caused by Nr0b2 deficiency. Mechanistically, NR0B2 inhibited IKKβ kinase activity via IKK complex interaction, downregulating NF-κB signalling. Our results demonstrate that NR0B2 has a chondroprotective role in OA progression by regulating matrix-degrading enzymes in an IKKβ/NF-κB-dependent manner, and gene therapy targeting Nr0b2 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for OA.

 Disordered superconducting materials with high kinetic inductance are an important resource for generating nonlinearity in quantum circuits and creating high-impedance environments. In thin films fabricated from these materials, the combination of disorder and low effective dimensionality leads to increased order parameter fluctuations and enhanced kinetic inductance values. Among the challenges of harnessing these compounds in coherent devices are their proximity to the superconductor-insulator phase transition and the two-level systems located in the disordered structure. Here, we fabricate tungsten silicide wires from quasi-two-dimensional films and embed them into microwave resonators and fluxonium qubits, where the kinetic inductance provides the inductive part of the circuits. In this work, we study the dependence of loss on the frequency, disorder, and geometry of the devices, and find that the loss increases with the level of disorder and is dominated by the localized quasiparticles trapped in the spatial variations of the superconducting gap.

 The automated discovery of chemical and catalytic reactions remains a major challenge in computational chemistry, particularly in complex systems where conventional methods struggle to identify optimal searching directions. Here, we propose Loxodynamics, a machine-learning-driven approach for reaction exploration via biased molecular dynamics. By leveraging the skewness of local probability distributions, Loxodynamics dynamically determines low-energy barrier directions, efficiently guiding the system toward metastable states. The core of our framework is Skewencoder, an Autoencoder augmented with a skewness-based loss function that extracts reaction coordinates from minimal sampling data. Through iterative sample-and-search cycles, the system adaptively maps the free energy surface, capturing finite-temperature effects critical to complex reactive environments. We validate our method across model potentials, gas-phase reactions (SN 2 and Diels-Alder), and catalytic alcohol dehydration in acidic chabazite under operando conditions. Loxodynamics provides a systematic framework for reaction discovery that addresses key limitations of conventional techniques, notably by allowing acceleration without elevated temperatures or a priori knowledge of collective variables.

 Unveiling interfaces at sub-nanometer scales is essential for advancing the understanding of complex chemical transformations. However, characterizing solid-liquid interfaces with high dimensional sensitivity and temporal resolution remains challenging, due to their dynamic nature and inaccessibility by conventional probes. Here we present an approach, Pattern-enhanced Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering, to overcome the challenges. Rooted in a “sample-as-optics” philosophy, this technique utilizes precisely engineered line-grating nanopatterns to modulate near-field X-ray illumination, coherently enhancing scattering signals from the line-gratings. We implement the method using Ni line-grating nanopatterns in electrochemical water oxidation. The periodic nanostructures serve as diffractive optical elements to reveal the Ni oxidation gradients and structural dynamics at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces. Finite-element simulations corroborate the observed trends by modeling variations in compositions and structures during electrocatalysis. Through integrating advanced sample design with coherent wave nature of soft X-rays, our approach opens accessible pathways to operando exploring chemical evolution and sub-nanometer dimensional variations simultaneously in electrochemical systems. This non-destructive method is efficient and element-specific, making it valuable for probing chemical and dimensional dynamics with appropriate modeling.

 The rapid growth of AI systems has been fueled by large-scale human data, intensifying concerns over the unauthorized use of intellectual property and privacy-sensitive content during model training. Auditing such misuse is particularly challenging since mainstream AI services operate as black boxes, exposing only generated outputs while concealing their training and inference processes.

 Paleoclimate records provide a critical long-term perspective on natural climate variability, essential for understanding contemporary climate variations. However, existing paleoclimate proxies lack sufficient spatial-temporal coverage for studying high-impact weather extremes like tropical cyclones (TCs). Here we introduce a multi-source framework that contextualizes the contemporary TC landfalls in East Asia against a multi-century baseline (1368–1911) reconstructed from historical documents. Leveraging pre-industrial and contemporary-era data, the analysis reveals that the relatively small shift toward earlier landfalls in the contemporary era (1946–2020) falls well within the range of fluctuations documented historically (1651–1900). Rather than indicating detectable anthropogenic changes, these results suggest the dominance of natural variability in modulating landfall timing. Our work also suggests consistent natural controls of TC timing in contemporary and pre-industrial eras. This consistency lends credibility to pre-industrial observational datasets and climate simulations, providing a robust template for assessing changes in the seasonality of high-impact extremes."

 Floodplain sediments play a central role in redox-driven biogeochemical cycles through their electron exchange capacity, yet its origin remains unclear because of strong chemical heterogeneity. Here we quantified the electron-accepting and electron-donating capacities of 45 sediments from two Yangtze River floodplains using mediated electrochemical analysis. We identified that electron-accepting capacity was controlled by acid-extractable reactive ferric iron associated with iron (oxyhydr)oxides and expandable phyllosilicates. Electron-donating capacity was mainly contributed by terrigenous humic fractions (12.9–61.2%) and reactive ferrous iron (38.8–87.1%). Lignin-like compounds with low double bond equivalent were the dominant organic contributors to electron-donating capacity. For ferrous iron, its contribution to sediment electron-donating capacity was much smaller than predicted by chemometric analysis because a large fraction of ferrous iron associated with phyllosilicates was redox-inert due to chemical and structural constraints. The composition of electron exchange capacity dictated microbial selection of terminal electron acceptors, driving the conversion of high-redox-potential electron-accepting capacity into electron-donating capacity. This transformation of electron exchange capacity has important implications for suppressing methanogenesis in floodplains and for oxidant consumption during contaminated aquifer remediation.

 Large earthquakes in mountainous regions trigger extensive landslides, which mobilize organic carbon via soil erosion and vegetation loss, disrupting carbon reservoirs and influencing CO2 levels. Quantifying earthquake impacts on carbon stock and cycling remains challenging. Here, we use field organic carbon data from 91 quadrats and over 20 years of remote sensing imagery to assess the impact of landslides from the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake on the carbon budget. We show that these landslides removed 2.72 ± 0.52 Tg of organic carbon in the upper Min Jiang. While its oxidation releases CO2, rapid revegetation offsets this, making the earthquake a net carbon sink. Time-series data indicate that vegetation carbon stocks will recover to 50% of pre-earthquake levels in 74 ± 5 years, whereas soil organic carbon recovery to 50% may take 500–850 years. This study highlights the decadal to centennial-scale impact of extreme events on carbon cycling. Earthquake-triggered landslides initially release carbon, but rapid revegetation and organic carbon burial later outweigh these losses, shifting affected mountain landscapes from a carbon source to sink over decades to centuries, based on field data and remote sensing."

 Droughts have intensified under climate change, threatening ecosystem stability. While rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations may enhance vegetation drought resistance, the net effect remains uncertain amid concurrent warming. Here we combine ecological modeling with multi-source observations to investigate how CO2 and warming jointly regulate vegetation drought responses on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, a sensitive alpine region exposed to escalating drought threats under changing precipitation regimes. Using factorial scenarios to isolate individual forcings, we show that 40-year CO2 rise mitigated drought-induced productivity losses by 5.7 ± 0.9% under constant temperature. However, in the presence of warming, rising CO2 intensifies drought stress by 5.2 ± 0.5%, reflecting increased plant water demand and disrupted regional water supply-demand balance. Permafrost areas experienced the strongest CO2-driven drought alleviation under constant temperature, but also the greatest warming-induced reversal. These findings reveal interacting CO2-warming impacts on alpine vegetation drought responses, highlighting ecological risks for the plateau and other permafrost-dominant regions under future warming. Rising CO₂ levels reduced drought stress on plants on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau over the past four decades, but this benefit is largely cancelled out by warming that increases plant water demand, as revealed by ecological modelling and multi-source observations from 1979 to 2018."

 Mapping mangrove species is crucial for mangrove biodiversity protection and ecological restoration. Existing mangrove classification methods mostly rely on the height and intensity metrics of rasterized lidar point clouds, which lead to the partial loss of fine three-dimensional (3D) structural information, and are difficult to distinguish among small inter-class differences, complex structures (dense canopy and aerial roots), and uneven mangrove stands. To directly capture the species community structure of mangroves from a 3D perspective, this study develops a point-wise deep learning species classification method specifically for mangroves—called Mangrove Multi-stage Attention Fusion and Class Token Network (Mangrove-Net), using UAV lidar point clouds and RGB imagery fusion data. Mangrove-Net uses a multi-stage attention fusion and class token mechanism to balance local geometric representation with global semantic perception, effectively capturing representative features among mangrove species. To address sample-imbalanced classification tasks, Mangrove-Net introduces a weighted cross-entropy loss function. We tested the proposed method on a typical mangrove forest dataset (from the Hainan Qinglangang Provincial Nature Reserve, China) and on the open dataset ModelNet40. The results indicated that Mangrove-Net showed superior performance compared to six state-of-the-art point-based deep learning methods (such as PointNet++, Point Transformer, PointMLP, and GPSFormer) in mapping fine-grained mangrove species, with a minimum improvement of 6.60% and 7.71% in overall accuracy (OA) and mean category accuracy (mAcc), respectively. Multi-scale visualization (sample, local, and study area) showed that the mangrove species maps generated by our proposed method had higher spatial continuity and ecological consistency. Evaluated on the ModelNet40 dataset, Mangrove-Net also surpassed those baseline methods, further demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the method. This study provides a reliable point-wise deep learning method specifically for mangrove species classification to support various tasks in fine-grained precision mangrove forestry."

 Satellite-derived shoreline mapping is a common technique for quantifying geomorphic shoreline change. However, shoreline positions derived using moderate-resolution data have questionable accuracy, are influenced by metocean conditions, and are typically based on the boundary of a binarized spectral index rather than a visible geomorphic indicator, such as the high-water line (HWL). PlanetScope (PS) can visualize the location of the HWL by detecting the spectral reflectance differences between wet and dry sediment along a sandy beach surface due to its improved spatial resolution of 3 m/pixel. The accuracy of nine HWL proxy shoreline positions is assessed by comparison to a contemporaneous mean high water (MHW) shoreline delineated across Moro Beach, CA, using a digital elevation model created from RTK GPS-corrected Unmanned Aircraft System imagery. The offset between the PS-derived HWL and UAS-derived MHW positions (Δd) was measured every 10 m in the alongshore direction using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System for each HWL dataset. A significant exponential relationship was observed between Δd and the tide height at the time of PS image acquisition, whereby the HWL shoreline was located further landward (seaward) during higher (lower) tides. The HWL shoreline, when acquired at or near low tide, was spatially coincident with the MHW shoreline, the most reliable yet cost-prohibitive shoreline proxy. PlanetScope’s advancement in spatiotemporal resolution introduces a new approach to satellite-derived shoreline mapping, one that is based on a geomorphic proxy position and a minimized influence of tide heights."

 High-spatiotemporal-resolution sunshine duration (SD) data has consistently been a significant concern in critical domains and provides strong support for estimating incident solar radiation (Rs). To achieve highly precise hourly estimations of both SD and Rs, this study developed a ‘multimodal hourly SD model to SD-based hourly Rs model’ framework using FY-4 and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data spanning 2019–2024. Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) classification model combined with transformer regression model was constructed for hourly SD model, and a radiation transfer empirical model based on grid SD data was constructed for grid SD-based hourly Rs model. The models were trained, tested, and validated using ground measured data from Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations. Validation results demonstrated high performance: the estimated hourly SD showed a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.96 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.11 h, while the estimated hourly Rs achieved an R of 0.91 and an RMSE of 97.31 W/m2 against ground-measured data. Furthermore, an analysis of the impacts of climatic conditions on SD-based hourly Rs model showed that water vapor content and temperature were positively correlated with both R and RMSE. Our methodology offered a new perspective for hourly SD and Rs inversion, which combined multi-source geostationary satellite remote sensing and ground-based observation data."

 Human-landscape interactions in mountainous terrains are complex and multi-faceted. Settlements tend to focus on relatively gently undulating terrains, which are often found in areas where ground conditions are weak and thus substantial ground movements prevail. Interventions in these precarious landscapes, such as progressive expansion of interconnecting transport infrastructure, affect the stress balance and hydrology of already critical slopes, potentially enhancing their sensitivity to changes. The mountainous Bailong River Corridor (BRC) in Northwest China is dominated by large slow-moving landslides, where any transport infrastructure expansion has to transit through. A complex interplay of human, precipitation, and seismic factors determines the triggering dynamics of these large movements. This study integrates displacement time series, precipitation, and road distribution to quantify the impact of road emplacement on the sensitivity of large slow-moving landslides to precipitation regionally using panel regression analysis. It is shown that road disturbance significantly amplifies the sensitivity of landslide displacements to precipitation, and paved roads on the large slow-moving landslides increase their sensitivity to precipitation by 40%. Roads (both paved and unpaved) also reduce the threshold of antecedent cumulative precipitation required to trigger significant displacement, shortening the typical period from 132 days to only 120 days. The enhanced response frequency increases large reactivated landslide risk, and impacts road operation and management. This better understanding of the precipitation signature in the dynamics of large slow-moving landslides transited by roads contributes to improving future road planning, enhancing landslide risk mitigation, and strengthening urban resilience in vulnerable alpine environments."

 Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have limited effectiveness in geospatial question answering because text-based similarity retrieval cannot adequately represent spatial semantics such as topology and spatial context. To overcome this limitation, we propose GeoAgentic-RAG, a multi-agent framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform autonomous geospatial reasoning. The framework integrates natural language query parsing, semantic-spatial retrieval, and executable geospatial analysis within a unified, agent-based workflow. Multiple specialized agents collaboratively interpret user queries, retrieve relevant vector and raster datasets from a unified geospatial database, decompose analytical tasks, generate valid spatial logic, and produce interpretable analytical results. We evaluate GeoAgentic-RAG using a benchmark of geospatial retrieval, feature characterization, and spatial relational reasoning tasks in Nanjing and Guangzhou. The proposed framework achieves a pass rate of 85.3% and an answer correctness of 88.3%, outperforming conventional RAG methods and representative code-generation baselines. These results demonstrate that agent-based integration of retrieval and spatial analysis substantially improves the reliability of geospatial question answering and provides a practical framework for the next-generation intelligent GIS applications."

 After a long period of stability from 2000 to 2007, global methane (CH4) concentrations have been increasing every year, and this increase has been mainly related to increased emissions from anthropogenic sources. The Amazon is the largest tropical forest in the world and has been experiencing major impacts due to dominantly biogenic sources. In this study, we present data obtained from vertical profiles measured between 2010 and 2023, which allow us to understand the role of the Amazon Forest in the global growth of CH4 emissions, as well as the impact of reduced precipitation on regional emissions. Annual growth rates ranged from 9.7 to 10.3 ppb ⋅ year−1 in the regions northwest (TAB_TEF_CZS), northeast (SAN), southwest (RBA), and southeast (ALF) from Amazon. These values are similar to the global average (9.7 ppb year−1), indicating that the Amazon follows the global trend of increasing CH4 concentrations. Although much of the Amazon is seasonally or permanently flooded, emissions from flooded areas alone are not sufficient to explain the upward trend in CH4 concentrations. Monthly and annual flux calculations indicate regional emission patterns. The results reinforce the relevance of human action in the variability of methane emissions in the Amazon."

The reliable air quality early warning system is an essential requirement by air pollution control authorities and other decision makers to effectively manage deteriorating air quality and implement pollution control measures in advance particularly in cities. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has launched an air quality early warning system (AQEWS) in India, developed in collaboration between the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). This system utilizes the SILAM (System for Integrated Modeling of Atmospheric Composition) chemistry-transport model to provide hourly predictions of air quality for the next 72 h, covering all criteria pollutants, including particulate matter and gaseous species, in a dynamic framework for the domain 60o – 100oE, 0 - 40oN. The meteorological forcing is provided from the operational 3 km IMD Weather Research Forecast (IMD-WRF) model at 3 km × 3 km spatial resolution. The SILAM simulated PM2.5 mass concentration is compared against the in-situ observations over major cities of India such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Lucknow and Patna. The evaluation of air quality forecasts for PM2.5 concentrations reveals that SILAM excels in predicting episodes of Unhealthy air quality, but shows moderate skill in predicting Very Unhealthy episodes. Moreover, SILAM demonstrates strong statistical performance in predicting PM2.5 concentrations, with results falling within anticipated uncertainty ranges. The air quality early warning system enables decision-makers to take proactive, science-based measures to prevent air quality deterioration, informed by reliable forecasts."

 With the increasing frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs) due to global climate change, their impact on air pollution, particularly particulate matter and Ozone (O3), in China has become more evident. However, the effects of TCs on organic aerosol (OA) formation remain less understood. This study examined the influence of TCs on the abundance, chemical composition, and origins of atmospheric OA, using PM2.5 samples collected from a coastal city in southern China before and after two TCs in October 2021. The average OA concentration before the TCs (5.64 ± 3.00 μg·m−3) was higher than after TCs (4.45 ± 1.38 μg·m−3). Pre-TC OA levels were primarily linked to stagnant weather conditions, whereas post-TC levels were influenced by regional transport of anthropogenic OA and aqueous-phase secondary formation processes. Fluorescence spectra analysis revealed that OA was predominantly composed of protein-like substances (57 ± 10%), with changes in composition driven by oxidized humic-like substances, especially the low-oxygenated component. Using a dispersion-normalized method, we found that primary anthropogenic emissions and O3-driven oxidation consistently made significant contributions to OA throughout the study period. However, during the stagnant phase of the pre-TC period, OA concentrations normalized by dispersion were low, likely due to reduced primary emissions and lower isoprene SOA production yields. Furthermore, OA levels decreased during the pre-TC period, which was associated with increases in temperature and changes in NOx/O3 ratios, thereby affecting gas-phase photochemical reactions. Our study reveals for the first time the impact of TCs on OA formation, offering new insights into the occurrence of summer particulate matter pollution and the feedback mechanism between aerosols and meteorological conditions."
