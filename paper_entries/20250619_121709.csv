However, the sources of this dust are not well-documented, limiting understanding of dust emissions. Here, we systematically quantify dust source activation frequency (DSAF) across East Asia (80–130° E; 27–52° N) between January 2016 and December 2023. Our data reveal a vast dust-active area extending from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in the southwest to the Huin Bair Sandy Land in the northeast, but two regions dominate: southern sources centered on the margins of the Taklimakan Desert and northern ones centered on the valleys of the Gobi Desert. East Asia is most dust-active in boreal spring (46% of all recorded events). This seasonal peak is pronounced in northern sources where snow cover, vegetation and orographic/topographic influence on winds are clear controls on DSAF. The main southern sources are active year-round with DSAF hotspots attributable to desiccated lakes and riverbeds. The TP, commonly considered a sink for in-bound windblown dust, is also a dust source, particularly in winter, with emissions controlled by precipitation patterns, snow cover and wind funneling through deep river gorges. Contrary to suggestions, our data show that the Loess Plateau is not a major dust source. We document a marked increase in dust source activation during the 2020 extreme heat wave on the overgrazed Mongolian Plateau grasslands. Our data provide a framework to study past variability in the two-way climate interactions that control dust emissions on historical and geological timescales and a baseline from which to measure future change."

Despite rapid urbanization, much of the region’s critical urban infrastructure remains outdated and ill-equipped to withstand climate-induced risks. This study assesses and compares the vulnerability of urban infrastructure, examining governance priorities and climate change exposure across the six largest cities in this under-researched region. Based on the urban resilience framework, this study adopts a mixed-methods approach that integrates climate data, city strategies, and governance analyses, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of urban resilience. The findings reveal substantial variations in urban resilience across the cities, with Astana and Almaty exhibiting stronger financial capacities, while Bishkek and Dushanbe face severe financial and infrastructural constraints. The study underscores the need for adaptive governance mechanisms, integration of climate policy into infrastructure management, and sustainable financing models to build climate-resilient urban environments—lessons applicable to transition economies outside the region."

A particular class of these approaches—referred to as enhanced weathering (EW)—seeks to modify the surface alkalinity budget to store CO2 as dissolved inorganic carbon species. Here, we use a reaction-transport model designed to simulate EW in managed lands to evaluate the throughput and storage timescales of anthropogenic alkalinity in agricultural soils in the coterminous U.S. We find that lag times between alkalinity modification and carbon removal can span from years to many decades depending on region. Background soil cation exchange capacity, agronomic target pH, and fluid infiltration all impact the timescales of CDR relative to the timing of alkalinity input, suggesting there is scope for optimization of alkalinity transport through variation in land management practice. However, shifting practices to reduce lag times may decrease total CDR from weathering and lead to non-optimal nutrient use efficiencies and soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. Our results indicate that there may be a large temporal disconnect between deployment of EW and climate-relevant CDR, with important implications for monitoring, reporting, and verifying carbon removal through EW."

The findings demonstrate an intensification in future heat stress across the AP, with a projected increase in extreme caution and danger days under SSP5-8.5, compared to SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios. The coastal cities are projected to experience higher heat stress intensity and more heat stress days than inland cities, making them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. By 2100, the average population exposure to extreme caution days will increase by 1.38–2.5 and danger days by 0.13–1.0 million people-days under the selected SSPs, relative to the baseline period. Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable, with work performance potentially declining by 6%–21%. The heat-related mortality risk ratio will increase by 2.3–35.4 times under the selected SSPs across the entire AP.

Considering this, the Indian Smart Cities Mission was initiated in 2015 to make cities resilient to climate change and promote the nation’s growth. Thus, we quantify the historical precipitation variability in precipitation amount and days. Further, we assessed the nonstationary influence of the El Nino Southern Oscillations, Indian Ocean Dipole, and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations on future precipitation extremes projections for 10, 25, 50, and 100 year return levels. Based on this, we computed the hazard due to precipitation dynamics across Indian cities and found it to be maximum for Silvassa city. Subsequently, we assessed the vulnerability of the cities based on the urban infrastructure and development and exposure to the regional population and economy to compute the risk for Indian cities. The study revealed that Ahmedabad, Thane, and Surat cities observed maximum risk due to precipitation dynamics in a changing climate. Further, we observed that risk was induced due to precipitation dynamics and associated extremes observed to be maximum in the Northwest, West Central, and Central Northeast precipitation zones.

Using remote sensing observations during two field experiments in Houston, Texas, we identify four diurnal patterns of shallow convective clouds. We find areas more frequently experiencing shallow convective clouds, and we find areas where the vertical extent of shallow convective clouds is higher and where they are more likely to precipitate. This provides insight into the complicated environment that forms these clouds in Houston. 
 Shallow convection plays an important role in Earth's climate system by regulating the vertical transport of heat, moisture, and momentum in the lower troposphere. Aerosols, large-scale meteorology, and low-level convergence influence the spatiotemporal variability in shallow convection, and the coastal urban area of Houston, Texas, is an ideal laboratory to investigate these complex interactions. Here, geostationary satellite and ground-based radar observations from June to September 2022 during the TRacking Aerosol Convection interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER) and Experiment of Sea Breeze Convection, Aerosols, Precipitation, and Environment (ESCAPE) field campaigns are used to characterize the spatial coverage, vertical extent, and precipitation fraction of shallow convective clouds. The fused operational remote sensing datasets over a 250 km × 250 km domain are evaluated against profiling observations. The domain-wide diurnal shallow cloud fractions are used to identify four distinct modes of shallow convection. In all clusters, the domain-wide cloud fractions are consistently higher than the domain-wide precipitation fractions, and shallow cloud fractions are higher over water than they are over land, while the shallow precipitation fractions show the opposite behavior. In the two modes with minimal deep cloud activity, shallow cloud frequency is highest over ocean in the early morning, and there is a transition to higher shallow cloud frequency over land by the afternoon in one cluster or to high shallow cloud frequencies everywhere by the afternoon in the other. Lastly, we find regions with higher shallow cloud top heights and a large region along the coastline where shallow clouds are more likely to precipitate."
10.5194/acp-25-6001-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文描述了一项新的多模型比对实验，旨在评估平流层气溶胶注入（SAI）对平流层化学、动力学以及臭氧的影响。该实验采用了一种约束设置，通过预设平流层气溶胶分布和固定海面温度及海冰，来研究SAI的影响。论文重点在于理解SAI引起的大气响应的驱动因素，并区分平流层控制的影响与海洋耦合的影响。虽然没有直接提及遥感技术，但该研究涉及大气成分分析（特别是气溶胶和臭氧），气候模型验证，以及对流层-平流层耦合等关键过程，这些都与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。例如，卫星观测可以用来验证模型预测的气溶胶分布和臭氧变化。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术存在较强的关联。,"['Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention', 'Stratospheric chemistry', 'Atmospheric dynamics', 'Ozone', 'Climate modeling', 'Aerosol distribution', 'Stratosphere-troposphere coupling']",Simone Tilmes;Ewa M.

Kinnison;Gabriel Chiodo;David Plummer,Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention experiment for the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative,"In this paper, we describe the details of a new multi-model intercomparison experiment to assess the effects of Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention (SAI) on stratospheric chemistry and dynamics and, therefore, ozone. Second, we discuss the advantages and differences of the more constrained experiment compared to fully interactive model experiments. This way, we advance the process-level understanding of the drivers of SAI-induced atmospheric responses. 
 A new Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention (SAI) experiment has been designed for the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-2022) to assess the impacts of SAI on stratospheric chemistry and dynamical responses and inter-model differences using a constrained setup with a prescribed stratospheric aerosol distribution and fixed sea surface temperatures and sea ice. This paper serves a dual purpose: first, it describes the details of the experimental setup and the prescribed aerosol distribution and demonstrates the suitability of the simplified setup to study SAI impacts in the stratosphere in a multi-model framework. The experiment allows attributing inter-model differences to the resulting impacts on atmospheric chemistry, radiation, and dynamics rather than the model uncertainty arising from differences in aerosol forcing and feedbacks from the ocean and sea ice under SAI. Second, we use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM6) to compare the interactive stratospheric aerosol configuration with coupling to land, ocean, and sea ice used to produce the stratospheric aerosol distribution with the results of the constrained SAI experiment.  With this, we identify and isolate the stratosphere-controlled SAI-induced impacts from those influenced by the coupling with the ocean. Overall, this comparison facilitates an advanced process-level understanding of the drivers of SAI-induced atmospheric responses. For example, we confirm earlier suggestions that the SAI-induced positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in winter, with the corresponding winter warming over Eurasia and related changes, is driven by stratosphere–troposphere coupling. Future multi-model comparisons will thus provide an important contribution to upcoming scientific assessments of ozone depletion."

The method is highly competitive, with commonly used parametric models yielding more accurate estimates while accounting for wavelength dependence. The resulting normalized estimation errors of the spectrometer spectral responses are less than 1 %, which will allow for better quantification of trace gas concentrations at the Earth surface. 
 High-resolution spectrometers are composed of different optical elements and detectors that must be modeled as accurately as possible. Specifically, accurate estimates of instrument spectral response functions (ISRFs) are critical in order not to compromise the retrieval of trace gas concentrations from spectral measurements. Currently, parametric models are used to estimate these response functions. However, these models cannot always take into account the diversity of ISRF shapes that are encountered in practical applications. This paper studies a new ISRF estimation method based on a sparse representation of the ISRF in a dictionary. The proposed method is shown to be very competitive when compared to parametric models, yielding up to 1 order of magnitude smaller normalized ISRF estimation errors. The method is applied to different high-resolution spectrometers, demonstrating its reproducibility for multiple remote sensing missions."

Bingemer,A view on recent ice-nucleating particle intercomparison studies: why the uncertainty of the activation temperature matters,"Ice-nucleating particle (INP) observations often differ by 1 order of magnitude, when multiple instruments measure in parallel. As INP measurements are sensitive to the activation conditions, inaccuracies in the temperature measurement may induce significant deviations in the INP concentration. It was found that typical temperature uncertainties reported in intercomparison studies may explain divergences of a factor of 2 (± 0.5 °C) or 5 to 10 (± 1 °C) between two INP counters with opposite bias. 
 Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) play a crucial role in cloud formation, influencing cloud phase, lifetime, and the onset of precipitation. Consequently, microphysical processes involving INPs strongly affect the radiative properties of clouds. However, when multiple INP counters are operated simultaneously, notoriously high deviations between instruments in the range of 1 order of magnitude are commonly observed. These differences occur in ambient atmospheric measurements as well as in laboratory studies. A potential reason for these discrepancies that deserves more consideration may be related to uncertainties and errors in the temperature measurement. As the activation of INPs is a strong function of the nucleation conditions, relatively small inaccuracies in the temperature measurement may lead to significant over- or underestimations of the INP concentration. In this study, we have explored this effect as a potential reason for the differences observed among INP counters by analyzing 10 INP intercomparison studies that were published within the last 10 years with a novel quantitative estimate of the temperature uncertainty effect on heterogeneous ice nucleation. The stated temperature uncertainty of instruments used in these experiments ranged from ±0.1 to ±1.5 °C, and was most commonly specified as ±0.5 °C. Potential deviations resulting from typical temperature errors were compared with the reported level of agreement for intercompared methods. As a measure of the potential INP error due to nucleation temperature error, we defined the temperature error factor (TEF) as the quotient of the ice nucleation activity at the actual nucleation temperature divided by the ice nucleation activity at a potentially erroneously measured temperature. Respective TEFs were calculated for five distinct activation spectra based on four INP parameterizations and one compilation of atmospheric INP data. TEFs were between 1.1 and 3.2 for temperature errors of ±0.5 °C, and between less than 2 and larger than 10 for temperature errors of ±1.5 °C. TEFs calculated from parameterizations of aerosols that are highly ice nucleation active were significantly larger than those derived from atmospheric data; although the effect was found to be still as large as a factor of 10 for certain temperature ranges in atmospheric activation spectra at a temperature error of ±2 °C. When comparing two INP instruments, measurement biases may be of opposite direction, thus resulting in expected differences of up to the product of both TEFs. We found that opposite biases of +0.5 and −0.5 °C can therefore typically explain differences of a factor of 2, while opposite biases of +1 and −1 °C can theoretically explain differences of factors up to 5 or even 10, which is of the order of discrepancies typically reported in the literature on INP intercomparisons. These results highlight the need to carefully assess and report on uncertainties of the ice nucleation activation temperature."

 In a rapidly changing climate, evidence-based decision-making benefits from up-to-date and timely information. Here we compile monitoring datasets (published at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15639576; Smith et al., 2025a) to produce updated estimates for key indicators of the state of the climate system: net emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. This year, we additionally include indicators for sea-level rise and land precipitation change. We follow methods as closely as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One report.The indicators show that human activities are increasing the Earth's energy imbalance and driving faster sea-level rise compared to the AR6 assessment. For the 2015–2024 decade average, observed warming relative to 1850–1900 was 1.24 [1.11 to 1.35] °C, of which 1.22 [1.0 to 1.5] °C was human-induced. The 2024-observed best estimate of global surface temperature (1.52 °C) is well above the best estimate of human-caused warming (1.36 °C). However, the 2024 observed warming can still be regarded as a typical year, considering the human-induced warming level and the state of internal variability associated with the phase of El Niño and Atlantic variability. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.27 [0.2–0.4] °C per decade over 2015–2024. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 53.6±5.2 Gt CO2e yr−1 over the last decade (2014–2023), as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track decreases or increases in the rate of the climatic changes presented here."

We use advanced artificial intelligence techniques and a massive amount of data, including observations at over 2500 gauges and a wealth of climate and environmental information. The maps are a critical step in understanding and predicting how carbon moves through our environment, hence making them a useful tool for tackling climate challenges. 
 Riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a vital role in regional and global carbon cycles. However, the processes of DOC conversion from soil organic carbon (SOC) and leaching into rivers are insufficiently understood, inconsistently represented, and poorly parameterized, particularly in land surface and Earth system models. As a first attempt to fill this gap, we propose a generic formula that directly connects SOC concentration with DOC concentration in headwater streams, where a single parameter, the transformation rate from SOC in the soil to DOC leaching flux (Pr), accounts for the overall processes governing SOC conversion to DOC and leaching from soils (along with runoff) into headwater streams. We then derive high-resolution Pr maps over the contiguous US (CONUS) using SOC data from two different sources: the Harmonized World Soil Database v1.2 (HWSD) and SoilGrids 2.0. Both maps are developed following the same five major steps: (1) selecting independent catchments where observed riverine DOC data are available with reasonable quality; (2) estimating catchment-average SOC for the independent catchments; (3) estimating the Pr values for these catchments based on the generic formula and catchment-average SOC; (4) developing a predictive model of Pr with machine learning (ML) techniques and catchment-scale climate, hydrology, geology, and other attributes; and (5) deriving a national map of Pr based on the ML model. For evaluation, we compare the DOC concentration derived using the Pr map and the observed DOC concentration values at evaluation catchments. The resulting mean absolute scaled error and coefficient of determination are 0.73 and 0.47 for the HWSD-based model and 0.58 and 0.72 for the SoilGrids-based model, respectively, suggesting the effectiveness of the overall methodology. Efforts to constrain uncertainty and evaluate sensitivity of Pr to different factors are discussed. To illustrate the use of such maps, we derive a riverine DOC concentration reanalysis dataset over CONUS. The two Pr maps, robustly derived and empirically validated, lay a critical cornerstone for better simulating the terrestrial carbon cycle in land surface and Earth system models. Our findings not only set a foundation for improving our predictive understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle at the regional and global scales, but also hold promises for informing policy decisions related to decarbonization and climate change mitigation.

We developed a continual-learning-based multilayer perceptron, integrating prior knowledge from numerical models and BGC-Argo validation to reconstruct a pan-European 3D nitrate field from 2010 to 2023 (0–2000 m depth, monthly, 0.25° horizontal resolution) using sea surface environmental features. This dataset helps bridge observational gaps and enhances understanding of the ocean's interior environment. 
 Nitrate plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, as it influences primary productivity. Despite its ecological significance, accurately mapping its three-dimensional (3D) concentration on a large scale remains a considerable challenge due to the inherent limitations of existing methodologies. To address this issue, this study proposes a continual-learning-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to reconstruct the 3D ocean nitrate concentrations above 2000 m depth over the pan-European coast. The continual-learning strategy enhances the model generalization by integrating knowledge from Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS) nitrate data, effectively overcoming the spatial limitations of Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) observations in comprehensive nitrate characterization. The proposed approach integrates the advantages of extensive spatial remote sensing observations, the precision of BGC-Argo measurements, and the broad knowledge from simulated nitrate datasets, exploiting the capacity of neural networks to model their nonlinear relationships between multisource sea surface environmental variables and subsurface nitrates. The model achieves excellent performance in profile cross-validation (R2=0.98, RMSE = 0.592 µmol kg−1) and maintains robustness across diverse 3D validation scenarios, suggesting its effectiveness in filling observational gaps and reconstructing the 3D nitrate field. Then, the spatiotemporal distribution of the reconstructed 3D nitrate field from 2010 to 2023 reveals a spatial distribution pattern, an interannual upward trend, and the degree of consistency in vertical variation. The contributions of all 22 input features to the model's estimation were quantified using Shapley additive explanation values. This study reveals the potential of the proposed approach to overcome observational limitations and provide further insights into the 3D ocean condition.

We compiled 1475 measurements from field samples and laboratory experiments, conducted since 2014, to facilitate the differentiation of CH4 formation pathways and processes, to identify existing gaps limiting application of Δ13CH3D and Δ12CH2D2, and to develop isotope ratio source signature inputs for global CH4 flux modelling. 
 Measurements of methane (CH4) molecules containing two rare isotopes (13CH3D and 12CH2D2), also termed doubly substituted or ‘clumped’ isotopologues, have the potential to provide two additional isotopic dimensions to help investigating mechanisms producing the recent global trends and CH4 budget over decadal timescale. In this work, we summarise the current state of research on doubly substituted CH4 isotopologues, with an emphasis on compiling results of all relevant work. The database comprises 1475 records compiled from the literature published until April 2025 (https://dx.doi.org/10.5285/51ae627da5fb41b8a767ee6c653f83e6). For field samples, 40 % of records were sourced from natural gas reservoirs, while microbial terrestrial (e.g., agriculture, lake, wetland) samples account only for 12.5 %. Lakes samples contribute 75 % to collected microbial terrestrial samples. There is limited or no representation of samples coming from significant microbial CH4 sources to the atmosphere, like wetlands, agriculture and landfill. To date, laboratory experiments were mostly focused on microbial (28 % of samples from laboratory experiments) and pyrogenic (15 %) methanogenesis or anaerobic (16 %), and aerobic (8 %) CH4 oxidation, and only a single contribution to studies of photochemical oxidation via OH and Cl (5 %). The distinct ranges of Δ13CH3D and Δ12CH2D2 values measured in these studies suggests their potential to improve our understanding of atmospheric CH4. This work provides an overview of the major gaps in measurements and identifies where further studies should be focussed to enable the highest immediate impact on understanding global CH4."

Wind and temperature reconstructions show reasonable skill, while humidity and sunshine duration perform less well. Application to historical wild fire events demonstrates the data set’s potential for impact studies. This is the first Swiss data set providing several variables at a high-resolution of 1x1 km and going back to 1763. 
 High-resolution gridded daily data is needed to study historical climate and weather impacts. Current daily gridded data sets in Switzerland extend to 1961 or 1971 for variables such as minimum and maximum temperature and sunshine duration. However, studying historical weather and climate events, such as the year-without-a-summer requires much longer time periods. For Switzerland, high-resolution gridded reconstructions of daily mean temperature and daily precipitation sums have recently been developed based on a large amount of early instrumental data for a period from 1763 to 1960. Here, we present an extension of these daily reconstructions to six more variables, namely, relative sunshine duration, relative humidity, minimum and maximum temperature at 2 m, and u- and v-wind at 10 m with a 1x1 km resolution. These additional reconstructions are based on the same method as the previous reconstructions by combining the analogue resampling method and data assimilation. Cross-validation results using a network representative of early 19th-century observations show a mean squared error skill score ranging from 0.70 to 0.80 for wind speed, depending on the season. For maximum and minimum temperature, values average between 0.48 to 0.82, depending on the seasons. These results indicate reasonable skill of the reconstructions and show that the wind and temperature fields outperform climatology despite the data scarcity in the historical period. However, for relative humidity and relative sunshine duration, the values of the mean squared skill score are significantly lower, ranging between -0.31 to 0.48. Furthermore, we explored the potential of the extended reconstructions by evaluating historical and contemporary wildfire events in Switzerland using the widely used Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI). The two historical fires were associated with a notably high fire danger in the reconstruction. For the contemporary winter fire, the reconstruction agrees well with the index calculated from the COSMO-1 weather forecast model, though neither indicates exceptionally high fire danger."

PaleoRiada, the first open palaeoflood database for Spain, addresses these issues by compiling data from 299 palaeoflood records, accessible via ArcGIS Online. This database aims to support the revision of Potential Significant Flood Risk Areas, providing insights for regions not included in current national flood maps. 
 Palaeoflood records are natural evidence of past flood events (typically found in landforms, sediments, or vegetation). Over the last 25 years, several palaeoflood record databases have been implemented. However, many of these databases are outdated, lack accessible or comprehensive palaeohydrological information, and present challenges in terms of data accessibility and reuse, particularly for non-research communities (e.g., planning administrations or flood risk managers). This work introduces PaleoRiada, the first open database that compiles published palaeoflood records from Spain. PaleoRiada stores typological, hydrological, temporal, and spatial data collected from approximately 126 publications (including journal articles, scientific reports, and book chapters). This database has been implemented using a simple Relational Database Management System (RDMS), integrated into a web platform, and is freely accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15627801 (Sandoval-Rincón et al., 2025). The PaleoRiada database contains 299 palaeoflood records (both geological and biological) dated between 2014 CE and 97,000 BP and distributed across both Atlantic (164) and Mediterranean (135) catchments. PaleoRiada includes 157 records with specific discharge values ranging from 0.02 to 320 m3/km2·s. These records are associated with a variety of river systems, including wide alluvial plains (25), Mediterranean ephemeral streams (17), mountain torrents (36), and confined valley rivers (79). Additionally, they encompass flood events (102), flash floods (48), dam failures (1), and hyperconcentrated flow events (6). The relationship between PaleoRiada and the Spanish Flood-prone Mapping Project (SNCZI) indicates that approximately 80 % of the PaleoRiada records are not included in the flood-prone areas defined by SNCZI. Therefore, several records can be consulted to prioritise or propose new areas for preliminary flood risk assessment. Accessibility and simplified data query and entry in PaleoRiada can facilitate the application of palaeoflood data in land planning and flood risk management."

To help improve emergency response, we created a global dataset called BRIGHT using both optical and radar images to detect building damage in any weather. We tested many artificial intelligence models and showed how well they work in real disaster scenes. This work can guide better tools for future disaster recovery and help save lives faster. 
 Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment, an essential capability crucial in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on developing artificial intelligence (AI) models to accurately map unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. These solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal EO data, particularly combining optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the lack of suitable benchmark datasets has constrained the development of robust multimodal AI models. In this paper, we present a Building damage assessment dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse multimodal dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of human-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, focusing on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The dataset's optical and SAR images with spatial resolutions between 0.3 and 1 meters provide detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise damage assessment. We train seven advanced AI models on BRIGHT to validate transferability and robustness. Beyond that, it also serves as a challenging benchmark for a variety of tasks in real-world disaster scenarios, including unsupervised domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised multimodal change detection, and unsupervised multimodal image matching. The experimental results serve as baselines to inspire future research and model development. The dataset (Chen et al., 2025), along with the code and pretrained models, is available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT and will be updated as and when a new disaster data is available. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track II. We hope that this effort will promote the development of AI-driven methods in support of people in disaster-affected areas."

Trained and validated on simulated data, our model accurately predicts emissions despite challenges like cloud cover. When applied to real OCO3 satellite images, the results closely match reported emissions. This study shows that neural networks trained on simulations can effectively analyse real satellite data, offering a new way to monitor CO2 emissions from space. 
 This paper presents the development and application of a deep-learning-based method for inverting CO2 atmospheric plumes from power plants using satellite imagery of the CO2 total column mixing ratios (XCO2). We present an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, processing the satellite XCO2 images to derive estimates of the power plant emissions, that is resilient to missing data in the images due to clouds or to the partial view of the plume owing to the limited extent of the satellite swath.The CNN is trained and validated exclusively on CO2 simulations from eight power plants in Germany in 2015. The evaluation on this synthetic dataset shows an excellent CNN performance with relative errors close to 20 %, which is only significantly affected by substantial cloud cover. The method is then applied to 39 images of the XCO2 plumes from nine power plants,  acquired by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 Snapshot Area Maps (OCO3 SAMs), and the predictions are compared to average annual reported emissions. The results are very promising, showing a relative difference in the predictions to reported emissions only slightly higher than the relative error diagnosed from the experiments with synthetic images. Furthermore, analysis of the area of the images in which the CNN-based inversion extracts the information for the quantification of the emissions, based on integrated-gradient techniques, demonstrates that the CNN effectively identifies the location of the plumes in the OCO-3 SAM images. This study demonstrates the feasibility of applying neural networks that have been trained on synthetic datasets for the inversion of atmospheric plumes in real satellite imagery from XCO2 and provides the tools for future applications."

We developed the Flexible Snow Model version 2 to quantify these uncertainties. In a first model demonstration, how unloading of intercepted snow from the forest canopy is represented is responsible for the largest uncertainty. Global mapping of forest distribution is also likely to be a large source of uncertainty in existing models. 
 Multiple options for representing physical processes in forest canopies are added to FSM, which is a model with multiple options for representing physical processes in snow on the ground. The canopy processes represented are shortwave and longwave radiative transfer; turbulent transfers of heat and moisture; and interception, sublimation, unloading, and melt of snow in the canopy. There are options for Beer's law or two-stream approximation canopy radiative transfer, linear or non-linear canopy snow interception efficiency, and time- and melt-dependent or temperature- and wind-dependent canopy snow unloading. Canopy mass and energy balance equations can be solved with one or two model layers. Model behaviour on stand scales is compared with observations of above- and below-canopy shortwave and longwave radiation, below-canopy wind speed, snow mass on the ground, and subjective estimates of canopy snow load. Large-scale simulations of snow cover extent, snow mass, and albedo for the Northern Hemisphere are compared with observations and land-only simulations by state-of-the-art Earth system models. Without accounting for uncertainty in forest structure metrics and parameter values, the ranges of multi-physics ensemble simulations are not as wide as seen in intercomparisons of existing models. FSM2 provides a platform for rapid investigation of sensitivity to model structure and parameter values or ensemble-based data assimilation for snow in open and forested environments."

In this study, the accuracy of SBM-based precipitation type diagnosis is compared with other traditional methods. SBM has a relatively higher accuracy for dry-snow and wet-snow events, whereas it has lower accuracy for rain events. When the microphysics scheme in the SBM was optimized for the corresponding region, the accuracy for rain events improved. 
 Winter precipitation types (WPTs) are controlled by many factors, including thermodynamic and microphysical processes. Therefore, realistically simulating interactions between precipitation particles and the atmosphere is important when diagnosing the WPT. In the present study, we analyze the performance of a modified version of the one-dimensional spectral bin model (SBM; version 1DSBM-19M) of Carlin and Ryzhkov (2019), which simulates the change in the physical characteristics of precipitation particles of various sizes as they fall from the cloud top to the ground and diagnoses surface WPTs. We compare the performance of the SBM and four other diagnostic methods that use the following variables: (1) atmospheric thickness, (2) wet-bulb temperature, (3) temperature and relative humidity, and (4) wet-bulb temperature and low-level lapse rate. Three reference WPTs (snow (SN), rain (RA), and RASN) are obtained from particle size velocity (PARSIVEL) disdrometer data using a newly proposed decision tree algorithm. The results show that the SBM has the highest overall hit rate for all cases among five diagnostic methods. In contrast, the hit rate of the SBM for each WPT shows lower performance for RA than for the other methods. These results indicate that the SBM simulations tend to underestimate melting compared to observations. We thus explore the effects of the SBM's microphysics scheme on the extent of melting in cases of misdiagnosed RA. An optimized SBM that uses the climatological snow density–diameter relationship for the Pyeongchang region produces an increased amount of melting and achieves improved skill scores compared to the current SBM, which uses a snow density–diameter relationship for the Colorado region."

We showed that Pd/TiO2 effectively terminated continuous sulfidation, achieving 100% CO conversion at 175 °C for 200 h under SO2 and H2O exposure. This exceptional sulfur tolerance was attributed to the formation of a distinct tridentate sulfate structure on the PdO nanoparticles, facilitated by the moderate reducibility and strong acidity of Pd/TiO2. In contrast, Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/CeO2 remained only ∼70 and 5% efficiency, accompanied by the abundant formation of Pd-related bidentate and Ce-related tridentate sulfate species, respectively. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses revealed the distinct in situ-formed tridentate Pd–SOx coordination over Pd/TiO2 regulated the local electronic distribution, effectively mitigating the affinity of the catalyst to SO2 while preserving the redox capability and reactivity of oxygen species.

Our experimental and kinetic modeling results suggest that Ce(III) oxidation by δ-MnO2 occurs in multiple steps: the adsorption of Ce(III) on the δ-MnO2 surface, the oxidation of Ce(III), and surface precipitation of CeIVO2.

We selected well-defined short-chain organic acids (OAc), i.e., formic acid (FA), oxalic acid (Ox), and citric acid (CA), which commonly occur as components of organic compounds, to examine how carboxylic density influences Fh transformation. Results showed that Fh transformation was mediated by specific organic-mineral/ion interactions. Monocarboxylic FA exhibited minimal binding affinity and thus had negligible influence on Fh transformation. In contrast, dicarboxylic Ox interacted with Fh and dissolved Fe3+, accelerating Fh dissolution by destabilizing Fe–O bonds of Fh and lowering aqueous Fe3+ activity. During subsequent nucleation, Ox preferentially adsorbed onto nascent hematite (Hm) nuclei via bidentate-mononuclear complexation. This interaction reduced Hm surface energy from 330 to 180 mJ·m–2, increasing nucleation rate ∼70-fold compared to goethite (Gt). Moreover, Ox likely guided Hm growth via oriented attachment, probably driven by van der Waals forces and/or patch-charge attraction.

This study aimed to develop and validate the first physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for iHg, incorporating species-specific physiological and chemical parameters to better characterize iHg kinetics in mice, rats, and humans. We included a hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to address the complex nature of iHg toxicokinetics. It facilitated parameter estimation while characterizing uncertainty and variability using an extensive species-specific iHg toxicokinetic database. Our results show narrower posterior distributions for most parameters across species, suggesting reduced uncertainty compared to prior distributions. Additionally, posterior estimates for absorption and excretion somewhat differ between humans and rodents, pointing to species-specific differences. The geometric standard deviations of the estimated residual errors typically remained below 3, indicating that the model fits the experimental data adequately.

Driscoll,Soil Mercury Accumulation Delays Fish Recovery from Atmospheric Deposition Declines,"Marked decreases in U.S. mercury emissions over the last 30 years reflect successful air quality management, but data documenting the responses of ecosystems and biota over this same period are limited. We synthesized long-term data on mercury cycling at Arbutus Lake in the Adirondack Park, NY, and evaluated whether brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from five regional lakes responded to changing watershed inputs. We find that the rate of watershed mercury inputs from dry deposition, wet deposition, and litterfall significantly decreased over the monitoring record (2003–2021), but the watershed continued to accumulate mercury by 25.2 ± 2.8 μg m–2 yr–1 (mean ± interannual SD). Annual fluxes of total mercury from the major tributary inflow to Arbutus Lake declined early in the record (−3.3% yr–1, 2005–2010) but have increased more recently (1.8% yr–1, 2015–2019), possibly in response to changing climate and soil chemistry. No significant trends were observed in the net total or methylmercury loading to Arbutus Lake, nor in fish mercury concentrations in nearby lakes. These findings suggest that legacy mercury in soils from historical deposition may delay the response of lake biota to declining mercury deposition and highlight the potential impacts of climate change on future mercury cycling within forested ecosystems."

We exposed juvenile coho salmon to roadway runoff or 6PPD-quinone to investigate whether disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood–gill barrier cause behavioral symptoms of urban runoff mortality syndrome in this sensitive species. BBB disruption was present in one-third of presymptomatic fish and in all symptomatic individuals, supporting its role in toxicity. Co-occurring brain and gill barrier disruptions at the onset of sustained surface swimming suggest a systemic vascular response rather than localized brain injury. Histological analysis of coho brains revealed red blood cell congestion within intact endothelia, consistent with circulatory collapse and plasma leakage, likely impairing oxygen delivery and disrupting neuronal signaling. Behavioral symptoms also coincided with altered expression of BBB junctional proteins genes (ocln, cld5α, and vecad). In Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), exposure to a high but environmentally relevant concentration of 6PPD-quinone reduced expression of the scaffolding protein zo-1, suggesting potential sublethal effects. These findings identify BBB disruption as a key event in 6PPD-quinone toxicity and link vascular injury to behavioral symptoms in coho salmon. Ongoing work in this model will further clarify mechanisms of action and support assessments of environmental and human health risks from tire-derived chemicals."

However, its efficacy for small, polar multifunctional C2–C3 organosulfates (C2–3OSs)─conceivably key products of isoprene oxidation─is questionable. Notable matrix effects are anticipated to arise from poor retention and coelution with abundant salts in PM samples. Here, we systematically evaluated RPLC versus hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with ESI-Orbitrap MS in quantifying PM-bound C2–3OSs. We synthesized three C2–3OSs, including glycolic acid sulfate, hydroxyacetone sulfate, and lactic acid sulfate. The availability of authentic standards enabled the first quantitative assessment of measurement bias for C2–3OSs using the RPLC-ESI-Orbitrap MS method, revealing an underestimation of these compounds by 1–2 orders of magnitude. The measurement bias primarily stemmed from the matrix effects arising from the coexisting bisulfate in ambient PM. In contrast, HILIC notably outperformed RPLC in retentive capacities and peak resolving abilities, effectively avoiding matrix suppression effects. Additionally, the HILIC-ESI-MS method uncovered six previously unreported C2–3OSs, expanding our knowledge of atmospheric OSs.

This study investigated the transformation of Fh nanoparticle film across a continuum of sizes of pore-scale spaces created by pressing a glass bead onto the film and immersing in 2 mM and 10 mM FeSO4 at pH = 7.0. While lepidocrocite (Lp) dominated over goethite (Gt) on the static Fh film, both minerals were observed to preferentially precipitate in micropore regions adjacent to the Fh film–glass bead contact area. The natural logarithm of product formation rates decreased linearly as increasing pore height (h) from 5 to 600 μm, revealing pronounced kinetic inhibition in macropore regions. Product mineral particles in smaller pore regions exhibited reduced primary particle size (146.1 ± 57.6 nm at h = 0.11 μm) compared with those in larger pores (222.5 ± 61.8 nm at h = 561.84 μm). COMSOL-based reaction-diffusion modeling shows that rapid Fe(III)labile intermediate supply from Fe(II)-catalyzed Fh dissolution drives its localized accumulation and elevated supersaturation within confined micropores, which ultimately dictates the pore-size-dependent distribution, formation kinetics, and primary particle size of the resulting product minerals. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the dominant role of intermediate precursor supply in dictating confinement-regulated phase transformation and highlight the notable effects of micropore size on Fh transformation and element cycling in natural porous media."

Historical manufacturing and disposal of PFAS have led to their introduction to the environment, although only a fraction of existing PFAS are routinely monitored using targeted analysis methods. Here, nontargeted analysis was used to investigate the identity and fate of PFAS present in eight groundwater and nine surface water samples collected near St. Paul, MN, surrounding two sites that historically received wastes from a PFAS manufacturer in the 1940–1970s. A total of 210 PFAS, split across 33 different homologous series, were identified in surface and groundwater samples both at and downstream of the two waste sites. Identified compounds included perfluorinated, polyfluorinated, and unsaturated sulfonic and carboxylic acid species as well as a variety of sulfonamide and sulfonamido chemistries. PFAS measured downgradient included legacy perfluorinated sulfonic and carboxylic acids, as well as their polyfluorinated, unsaturated, keto, and ether-containing analogs. Two-thirds of the identified PFAS were unique to the groundwater at one site. The lack of these PFAS at downstream sites likely reflects dilution below the limit of detection during downgradient transport.

This study presents the first record of Hg concentrations (HgC) and accumulation rates (HgAR) using sediment cores from four lakes around Mount Lyell. HgC and HgAR increased from the 1890s (onset of smelting), peaked from the 1920s (introduction of the flotation processing method), and declined after 1969 (smelter closure). Mercury isotopic signatures confirmed its anthropogenic source. Modeling of Hg deposition vs distance over the period 1922–1969 showed that it followed a power-law function. The Mount Lyell emissions may have affected an area up to ∼270,000 km2, beyond which deposition was indistinguishable from the natural background. Estimated total Hg loadings ranged from 23 to 43 t, compared to an estimated ∼150 t Hg contained in the ore floated. Isotopic data showed Δ199Hg trending toward zero near the smelter, indicating that the smelter was the main source of Hg. Our findings highlight that pyrometallurgical smelting methods contributed more significantly to Hg emissions than production volume. Studying legacy mines in the Southern Hemisphere, responsible for 29.1% of global Cu production during the preregulatory era (1880–1950), is critical to understanding historical Hg dispersion in this understudied region."

We examined UFP concentrations and size distribution across 32 particle diameters at a monitoring site in close proximity to Boston Logan International Airport across a two-year period, incorporating covariates for flight activity and meteorology. Total particle number concentration (PNC) was ∼2-fold higher when the site was downwind of the airport. During these wind conditions, particles between 8 and 12 nm in diameter comprised the largest proportion of overall PNC observed, consistent with aircraft contributions. Particle size distribution differed substantially between hours of predominant aircraft arrivals (peak modal diameter 9–11 nm) versus departures (peak modal diameter 39–52 nm). Peak concentrations of particles between 9 and 11 nm were found in the winter and during afternoon hours. We conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) to confirm particle size distributions from aviation activity. PCA results showed that nucleation-mode particles (<30 nm in diameter), specifically those between 9 and 11 nm, were associated with landing aircraft on a nearby runway, especially when the monitor was downwind of the airport. Our findings confirm that aviation-specific UFP emissions are dominated by nucleation mode particles, with long-term size distribution information able to distinguish between aircraft operations in near-airport communities."

The newly available Wildfire Burn Severity and Emissions inventory (WBSE) provides emissions estimates for individual large wildfires in California at a finer spatial resolution and for a longer historical record than global inventories. For the 2018 wildfire season, we utilized daily emissions from WBSE and the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINNv2.5) with atmospheric modeling to simulate fire-derived fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at 16 California receptors. Simulated concentrations with WBSE and FINNv2.5 were significantly correlated with station observations at 11 receptors, but the strength of correlations varied. We leveraged WBSE’s event-based framework and burn severity classification to quantify contributions of individual wildfires and burn severity classes to fire-derived PM2.5 pollution. We found that the top ten largest fires in our modeling period accounted for nearly all fire-derived PM2.5 pollution at our receptors. Most fire-derived PM2.5 came from moderate or high severity burned areas. Multiple fires contributed to almost all poor air quality days, and all had contributions from 3 to 4 burn severity classes. WBSE is a promising open-source inventory for event-based emissions and multiple emission scenarios for future climate change and land management."

A major pollutant in India, BrC absorption has received reasonable research attention, with studies focusing on spatial-temporal variability and emission sources. By synthesizing the available literature, this paper presents the current research status on the topic and identifies gaps that need to be addressed to better understand the climate impacts of BrC in India. In terms of the measurement of BrC light absorption, we find that the solvent extraction technique is the most commonly used, followed by the Ångström exponent extrapolation and the component subtraction techniques. Measurement sites are concentrated in the Indo-Gangetic plains, which show significantly higher absorption levels than other regions. Seasonal variability shows increased absorption during postmonsoon and winter periods, particularly in peninsular India. Though limited in number, studies on emission sources identify biomass burning and vehicular emissions as key contributors. In terms of radiative impact, assessments from the Indo-Gangetic plains suggest that BrC contributes substantially to direct radiative effects, potentially accounting for a net 31–48% warming. Global climate models assign a net forcing of 0.5–2 W m–2 over India; however, they rely on parametrizations derived from non-Indian locations and sources, which may not accurately represent BrC over India. Overall, expanded spatial coverage, diverse source characterization, and improved radiative effect estimations are key to decoding BrC’s climate impact in India and globally."

In addition to releasing large amounts of organic compounds in both the gas and particle phases, biomass burning plumes also emit inorganic species. Potassium salts are directly emitted, while ammonium salts can form due to reactions with ammonia. Aerosol particles formed from biomass burning are therefore a complex internal mixture of organic molecules and inorganic components. The molecular interactions between these species and water dictate the hygroscopic growth and phase behavior of the aerosol. In this work, we explore the hygroscopic growth and phase behavior for a series of mixed particles containing common water-soluble biomass burning compounds, phthalic acid, 4-nitrocatechol, and levoglucosan, and salts, potassium chloride, ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, and potassium sulfate. These measurements were carried out using a linear quadrupole electrodynamic balance (LQ-EDB) coupled with Mie resonance spectroscopy to probe single particles as a function of the relative humidity. The morphology of these samples was observed to span from well-mixed aqueous solutions to fully effloresced particles with a variety of phase-separated states identified in between. From light scattering and hygroscopic growth measurements, we infer the phase of the particles under atmospherically relevant conditions and report the onset of phase transitions. We break down the contributions of individual components to the hygroscopicity using the Zdanovskii–Stokes–Robinson relation and compare these to predictions from a semiempirical thermodynamic model (AIOMFAC). For fully deliquesced particles, the predictions generally agree with observations, while particles that have undergone phase transitions show the largest deviations. Overall, this work highlights the limitations of assuming that BB particles are well-mixed and provides important physicochemical data to predict and interpret the humidity response of the BB aerosol."

The ex vivo biosensor assay confirmed that VOCs triggered phenotypic transformation of aortic smooth muscle cells via epigenetic changes in aortic endothelial cells.

The results show nonnegligible impact of ice cloud temperature on simulated BTs, which can be as large as 3 K due to the difference between fixed 160 or 270 K cloud temperature and the benchmark counterpart, varying in accordance with the ambient temperature profile for a cloud residing between 249.6 and 199.6 K. To enhance the accuracy of FIR radiative transfer modeling, it is recommended to incorporate temperature‐dependent optical properties of ice clouds."

Here, we quantify long‐term changes in heavy precipitation frequency in the United States using hourly observations in 1949–2020 from 332 gauges. We demonstrate that, when analyzed collectively, the frequencies of heavy precipitation at multiple durations from hourly to daily exhibit an increase that cannot be explained by natural climate variability. Upward trends are significant at ∼20%–40% of the gauges throughout the country except for the coastal western and southeastern regions, with higher percentages for longer durations. We also show that the frequency of hourly heavy precipitation has mainly grown after ∼2000, thus explaining the limited evidence of trends at the subdaily scale reported in past studies."

However, the sensitivity of L‐VOD to different vegetation components, such as foliage and stems, remains poorly understood despite their distinct interannual variations. Here we investigate the differential sensitivity of L‐VOD to foliage biomass and aboveground biomass (AGB) at various spatiotemporal scales over contiguous US. Our analysis reveals that at interannual scale, L‐VOD's sensitivity to foliage biomass is 4.5–16.8 times greater than to AGB across various forest types. Given that foliage biomass typically exhibits larger interannual fluctuations than woody components, this suggests that L‐VOD may overestimate the interannual variability of total AGB by disproportionately responding to foliage dynamics. Although foliage constitutes only a small fraction of total aboveground biomass (∼2%), it accounts for 21.2% of the interannual variations in L‐VOD. However, when large‐scale disturbances reduce foliage and woody biomass proportionally, VOD effectively captures the AGB declines. These findings highlight the need to account for component‐specific sensitivities in VOD‐based models."

Repeat orbital imaging shows crescentic, transverse, and star dunes across the Hellespontus Montes region migrate, converge, and occasionally reverse course. Dune morphology and sand ripple migration identify three effective wind regimes that vary spatially and temporally, correlating with atmospheric modeling. Peak sand transport occurs during southern spring and summer to the west and southwest, driven by daytime anabatic slope winds originating from Hellas. Migration rates decline with waning temperatures, when eastward drainage winds into Hellas dominate nights annually and during the colder seasons. However, these diurnally and seasonally cyclic slope winds can be highly localized, as nearby barchan fields swiftly migrate exclusively west where eastward winds are mitigated by topography.

On the interannual scale, surface and subsurface events demonstrate an opposite correlation with ENSO, primarily due to distinct drivers at different depths. During the developing phase of El Niño, the Luzon Strait transport, indicative of the SCS throughflow (SCSTF), increases and necessitates stronger upwelling for mass balance. This upwelling, acting on large subsurface vertical temperature gradients, induces significant subsurface cooling and the occurrence of MCSs. As El Niño matures, excessive atmospheric heat flux warms the surface layer, triggering surface MHWs. This heat is then transported downward mainly by vertical turbulent mixing, diminishing subsurface cooling, and terminating subsurface MCSs. The scenario reverses during La Niña events. The SCSTF serves as a vital oceanic pathway, transmitting ENSO signals into the SCS and profoundly modulating subsurface MHWs and MCSs."

The transition is most pronounced in summer, with supercooled cloud fraction (CF $CF$) decreasing by 3.5% per decade and ice CF $CF$ increasing by 2.7% per decade. Enhanced cloud vertical development primarily drives this transition, accompanied by cloud‐top cooling of 6.0°C for supercooled and 10.2°C for ice clouds over the 17‐year period.

We find that PM2.5 concentrations plateau across seasons and regions in the contiguous U.S. since 2016, even after excluding estimated wildfire impacts, suggesting that the rise in wildfire activity alone does not account for these trends. The stagnation is primarily driven by a slowdown in the reduction of sulfate and a non‐significant increase in organic aerosols. In the Eastern and Central U.S., sulfate concentrations generally mirror decreasing anthropogenic SO2 emissions, except in winter, where chemical feedbacks related to oxidant limitations weaken the response of sulfate. We find that nitrate and NO2 concentrations decrease slower than anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, particularly in fall and winter, suggesting a potential overestimate in the decrease of NOx emissions in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Emission Inventory (NEI) and/or an increasing role of natural and non‐U.S. sources. In the Southeast, the decline in organic aerosol concentrations has stalled since 2015, possibly due to weaker decreases in sulfate‐induced secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from isoprene, combined with increases in monoterpene‐derived SOA as the climate warms. Despite continued decreases in the NEI black carbon (BC) emissions, BC concentrations have stagnated since 2015, even after removing the estimated influence of wildfire smoke, indicating a possible underestimate in emissions."

To reduce this bias, the response of QBO bias to the convection scheme in an AGCM is investigated using different convection schemes (Emanuel and spectral schemes) and a gravity wave (GW) scheme in which the GW properties are estimated from convective heating and mean wind. Unlike the known QBO bias in previous model intercomparison studies, the easterly wind and QBO amplitude in the lower stratosphere are excessively magnified when the Emanuel scheme is used. The spectral scheme reproduces similar known QBO biases, such as the mean westerly wind bias and the weak QBO amplitude in the lower stratosphere. To distinguish the cause of these biases, several sensitivity experiments using the spectral scheme with tunings are conducted. Application of several tunings mitigates the common QBO biases near the 50 hPa level. The zonal wind bias in the troposphere controls the GW and consequently the QBO properties. Further investigation reveals that improved convective momentum transport with phase speed tuning reduces the zonal wind bias and improved the QBO through modified GW momentum fluxes. The findings of this study may be applicable to other AGCMs if the tunings related to the convection scheme are adopted, potentially reducing zonal wind biases."

Driscoll,Quantification of Ozone Exposure Impacts and Their Uncertainties on Growth and Survival of 88 Tree Species Across the United States,"Exposure to ambient ozone (O3) impacts vegetation through cascading effects. Numerous tree species experience biomass loss and increased mortality following O3 exposure. Quantifying levels of O3 at which deleterious impacts occur to individual trees under in situ conditions is essential for the effective management of air and forest resources. Previously, O3 critical levels (CLs) were established based on controlled seedling experiments. However, seedling experiments may fail to reflect O3 impacts on mature trees. In this study, we report the first results for empirically derived, species‐specific O3 CLs for tree growth and survival using a database of ∼1.5 million trees observed over time across the conterminous United States. Using a machine learning approach, we calculated O3 CLs for 88 tree species (growth: 72 species; survival: 51 species). To our knowledge, most tree species we assessed have no prior determination of O3 CLs. Estimated O3 CLs (W126) for 5% decline in the tree growth rate ranged from 1.9 to 37.6 ppm‐hr (mean: 10.5 ppm‐hr), and estimated O3 CLs for 1% tree survival probability decline ranged from 1.9 to 37.9 ppm‐hr (mean: 9.3 ppm‐hr) across species. Recently (2016–2018), portions of the western United States exceeded O3 CLs for nearly all tree species for both growth and survival. Nationally, O3 exposure levels were below the growth CLs for most species, while levels may have exceeded the survival CLs for some species. Our results provide new evidence of the range and uncertainty of impacts of ozone exposure on trees across the United States."

In this study, we calculate the SWV radiative feedback in the CMIP6 model ensemble in a quadrupling CO2 experiment. Specifically, we compare the results of two quantifications: one accounting for the radiatively driven temperature adjustment in the stratosphere only and the other in the entire atmospheric column including both the stratosphere and the troposphere. The stratosphere‐adjusted feedback is found to be 0.25±0.06Wm−2K−1 $0.25\mathit{\pm }0.06\ \mathrm{W}{\mathrm{m}}^{-2}{\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$, but it reduces to 0.020±0.007Wm−2K−1 $0.020\mathit{\pm }0.007\ \mathrm{W}{\mathrm{m}}^{-2}{\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$ with the full atmosphere adjustment, indicating the radiation process alone may lead to a muted overall SWV radiative effect, due to the stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming simultaneously driven by the SWV radiative perturbation. This suggests that the radiative forcing of SWV is subject to an intrinsic and robust limiting effect. In addition, we analyze the intermodel spreads in the temperature adjustment and its radiative effect, and find the spreads primarily arise from the differences in SWV responses projected by GCMs, rather than the differences in their climatological states."

The analysis focuses on the meteorological drought measured by the 24‐month standardized precipitation index (SPI24). The results show that anthropogenic aerosols and GHGs have distinct effects on Asian drought trends. Aerosols dominate the drying trend in East Asia, whereas GHGs drive the wetting trend in Central Asia. In South Asia, their impacts tend to offset each other with aerosols playing a larger role. Moisture budget analysis indicates that the changes in the vertical motion are the primary drivers of drought changes in Asia. Aerosols‐induced stronger cooling of midlatitude continents reduces the land‐sea thermal contrast, which in turn weakens the summer monsoon circulation and suppresses precipitation over South and East Asia. Conversely, GHG‐induced strengthening of the westerly jet stream contributes to the alleviation of drought in Central Asia. Both the cooling effect of aerosols and warming effect of GHGs are stronger in the Norther Hemisphere, leading to an asymmetric change between the two hemispheres and causing a meridional shift of intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), which influences drought changes in South Asia."

 Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the availability of instruction.

Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) while mice learned multiple tasks, as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules.

 The ability of materials to respond to stimuli with significant optical nonlinearity is crucial for technological advancement and innovation1–3. Although photon-avalanche upconversion nanomaterials with nonlinearities exceeding 60 have been developed, further enhancement remains challenging4–6. Here we present a method to increase photon-avalanche nonlinearity beyond 500 by reconstructing the sublattice and extending the avalanche network. We demonstrate that lutetium substitution in the host material induces significant local crystal field distortions. These distortions strengthen cross-relaxation, the key process governing population accumulation. As a result, the optical nonlinearity is significantly amplified, enabling sub-diffraction imaging through single-beam scanning microscopy, achieving lateral and axial resolutions of 33 nm (about 1/32 of λExc) and 80 nm (around 1/13 of λExc), respectively (where λExc is the excitation wavelength). Moreover, our research shows regional differentiation within photon-avalanche nanocrystals, in which photon-avalanche performance varies across different regions at the single-nanoparticle level. This effect, coupled with extreme optical nonlinearity, enables visualization of nanoemitters at resolutions beyond their physical size using simple instrumentation. These advancements open new possibilities for super-resolution imaging, ultra-sensitive sensing, on-chip optical switching and infrared quantum counting.

Ritz,Bimodal centromeres in pentaploid dogroses shed light on their unique meiosis,"Insights into the dogrose genome and centromeres explain their ability to achieve stable sexual reproduction. 
 Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes1. Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses (Rosa sect. Caninae; 2n = 5x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents2,3. Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa. Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems.

 Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages that colonize the liver early during embryogenesis1. Upon liver colonization, KCs rapidly acquire a tissue-specific transcriptional signature, mature alongside the developing liver and adapt to its functions1–3. Throughout development and adulthood, KCs perform distinct core functions that are essential for liver and organismal homeostasis, including supporting fetal erythropoiesis, postnatal erythrocyte recycling and liver metabolism4. However, whether perturbations of macrophage core functions during development contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a mouse model of maternal obesity to perturb KC functions during gestation. We show that offspring exposed to maternal obesity develop fatty liver disease, driven by aberrant developmental programming of KCs that persists into adulthood. Programmed KCs promote lipid uptake by hepatocytes through apolipoprotein secretion. KC depletion in neonate mice born to obese mothers, followed by replenishment with naive monocytes, rescues fatty liver disease. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF1α) in macrophages during gestation prevents the metabolic programming of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, thereby averting the development of fatty liver disease. These results establish developmental perturbation of KC functions as a causal factor in fatty liver disease in adulthood and position fetal-derived macrophages as critical intergenerational messengers within the concept of developmental origins of health and diseases5.

 Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is a primary sensor for short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota. Consequently, FFA2 is a promising drug target for immunometabolic disorders1–4. Here we report cryogenic electronic microscopy structures of FFA2 in complex with two G proteins and three distinct classes of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), and describe noncanonical activation mechanisms that involve conserved structural features of class A GPCRs. Two PAMs disrupt the E/DRY activation microswitch5 and stabilize the conformation of intracellular loop 2 by binding to lipid-facing pockets near the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. By contrast, the third PAM promotes the separation of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 by interacting with transmembrane helix 6 at the receptor–lipid interface. Molecular dynamic simulations and mutagenesis experiments confirm these noncanonical activation mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the molecular basis for the Gi versus Gq bias, which is due to distinct conformations of intracellular loop 2 stabilized by different PAMs. These findings provide a framework for the design of tailored GPCR modulators, with implications that extend beyond FFA2 to the broader field of GPCR drug discovery.

 The pursuit of strong yet ductile alloys has been ongoing for centuries. However, for all alloys developed thus far, including recent high-entropy alloys, those possessing good tensile ductility rarely approach 2-GPa yield strength at room temperature. The few that do are mostly ultra-strong steels1–3; however, their stress–strain curves exhibit plateaus and serrations because their tensile flow suffers from plastic instability (such as Lüders strains)1–4, and the elongation is pseudo-uniform at best. Here we report that a group of carefully engineered multi-principal-element alloys, with a composition of Fe35Ni29Co21Al12Ta3 designed by means of domain knowledge-informed machine learning, can be processed to reach an unprecedented range of simultaneously high strength and ductility. An example of this synergy delivers 1.8-GPa yield strength combined with 25% truly uniform elongation. We achieved strengthening by pushing microstructural heterogeneities to the extreme through unusually large volume fractions of not only coherent L12 nanoprecipitates but also incoherent B2 microparticles. The latter, being multicomponent with a reduced chemical ordering energy, is a deformable phase that accumulates dislocations inside to help sustain a high strain hardening rate that prolongs uniform elongation.

 Climate change threatens global food systems1, but the extent to which adaptation will reduce losses remains unknown and controversial2. Even within the well-studied context of US agriculture, some analyses argue that adaptation will be widespread and climate damages small3,4, whereas others conclude that adaptation will be limited and losses severe5,6. Scenario-based analyses indicate that adaptation should have notable consequences on global agricultural productivity7–9, but there has been no systematic study of how extensively real-world producers actually adapt at the global scale. Here we empirically estimate the impact of global producer adaptations using longitudinal data on six staple crops spanning 12,658 regions, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories. We estimate that global production declines 5.5 × 1014 kcal annually per 1 °C global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise (120 kcal per person per day or 4.4% of recommended consumption per 1 °C; P < 0.001). We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor10,11, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although losses in low-income regions losses are also substantial.

 The microbiota has been recognized as a critical contributor to various diseases1, with multiple reports of changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in contexts such as inflammatory bowel disease2,3 and neurodegenerative diseases4. These microbial shifts can exert systemic effects by altering the release of specific metabolites into the bloodstream5,6, and the gastrointestinal microbiota has also been reported to exhibit immunomodulatory activity through the activation of innate and adaptive immunity7,8. However, it remains unclear how the microbiota contributes to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), where these microorganisms are typically absent. Here we report that T cells that recognize gut-colonizing segmented filamentous bacteria can induce inflammation in the mouse intestine and CNS in the absence of functional regulatory T cells. Gut commensal-specific CD4 T cells (Tcomm cells) that are dysregulated in the inflamed gut can become licensed to infiltrate into the CNS regardless of their antigen specificity and have the potential to be re-stimulated by host protein-derived antigens in the CNS via molecular mimicry, whereupon they produce high levels of GM-CSF, IFNγ and IL-17A, triggering neurological damage. These infiltrated Tcomm cells initiate CNS inflammation by activating microglia through their IL-23R-dependent encephalitogenic programme and their IL-23R-independent GM-CSF production. Together, our findings reveal potential mechanisms whereby perturbation of Tcomm cells can contribute to extraintestinal inflammation.

 Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death from an infectious disease1,2. Here we report the discovery of a first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor targeting PurF, the first enzyme in the mycobacterial de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. The lead candidate, JNJ-6640, exhibited nanomolar bactericidal activity in vitro. Comprehensive genetic and biochemical approaches confirmed that JNJ-6640 was highly selective for mycobacterial PurF. Single-cell-level microscopy demonstrated a downstream effect on DNA replication. We determined the physiologically relevant concentrations of nucleobases in human and mouse lung tissue, showing that these levels were insufficient to salvage PurF inhibition. Indeed, proof-of-concept studies using a long-acting injectable formulation demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of the compound. Finally, we show that inclusion of JNJ-6640 could have a crucial role in improving current treatment regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Together, we demonstrate that JNJ-6640 is a promising chemical lead and that targeting de novo purine biosynthesis represents a novel strategy for tuberculosis drug development.

 Brain organoids enable the mechanistic study of human brain development and provide opportunities to explore self-organization in unconstrained developmental systems1–3. Here we establish long-term, live light-sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labelled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviours and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development4. We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labelling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track actin, tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue-state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization and brain regionalization. On the basis of imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrix-induced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signalling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the WNT ligand secretion mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of non-telencephalic brain regions. Together, our work provides an inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics have a central role during brain regionalization.

 Capturing particles with low, nanonewton-scale adhesion is an ongoing challenge for conventional air filters1,2. Inspired by the natural filtration abilities of mucus-coated nasal hairs3,4, we introduce an efficient, biomimetic filter that exploits a thin liquid coating. Here we show that a stable thin liquid layer is formed on several filter media that generates enhanced particulate adhesion, driven by micronewton to sub-micronewton capillary forces5,6. Enhanced particle adhesion increases the filtration of airborne particulates while maintaining air permeability, providing longer filter lifetime and increased energy savings. Moreover, strong adhesion of the captured particles enables effective filtration under high-speed airflow as well as suppression of particle redispersion. We anticipate that these filters with thin liquid layers afford a new way to innovate particulate matter filtering systems.

 Each spring, billions of Bogong moths escape hot conditions across southeast Australia by migrating up to 1,000 km to a place that they have never previously visited—a limited number of cool caves in the Australian Alps, historically used for aestivating over summer1,2. At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator3–5, we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth’s known magnetic sense4), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth’s brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth’s magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination.

 All contemporary Eurasians trace most of their ancestry to a small population that dispersed out of Africa about 50,000 years ago (ka)1–9. By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa10–15. These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000 years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70 ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50 ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success.

 Distant-acting enhancers are central to human development1. However, our limited understanding of their functional sequence features prevents the interpretation of enhancer mutations in disease2. Here we determined the functional sensitivity to mutagenesis of human developmental enhancers in vivo. Focusing on seven enhancers that are active in the developing brain, heart, limb and face, we created over 1,700 transgenic mice for over 260 mutagenized enhancer alleles. Systematic mutation of 12-base-pair blocks collectively altered each sequence feature in each enhancer at least once. We show that 69% of all blocks are required for normal in vivo activity, with mutations more commonly resulting in loss (60%) than in gain (9%) of function. Using predictive modelling, we annotated critical nucleotides at the base-pair resolution. The vast majority of motifs predicted by these machine learning models (88%) coincided with changes in in vivo function, and the models showed considerable sensitivity, identifying 59% of all functional blocks. Taken together, our results reveal that human enhancers contain a high density of sequence features that are required for their normal in vivo function and provide a rich resource for further exploration of human enhancer logic.

 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a polygenic disorder occurring after extreme trauma exposure. Recent studies have begun to detail the molecular biology of PTSD. However, given the array of PTSD-perturbed molecular pathways identified so far1, it is implausible that a single cell type is responsible. Here we profile the molecular responses in over two million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 111 human brains, collected post-mortem from individuals with and without PTSD and major depressive disorder. We identify neuronal and non-neuronal cell-type clusters, gene expression changes and transcriptional regulators, and map the epigenomic regulome of PTSD in a cell-type-specific manner. Our analysis revealed PTSD-associated gene alterations in inhibitory neurons, endothelial cells and microglia and uncovered genes and pathways associated with glucocorticoid signalling, GABAergic transmission and neuroinflammation. We further validated these findings using cell-type-specific spatial transcriptomics, confirming disruption of key genes such as SST and FKBP5. By integrating genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we uncovered the regulatory mechanisms of credible variants that disrupt PTSD genes, including ELFN1, MAD1L1 and KCNIP4, in a cell-type-specific context. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of the cell-specific molecular regulatory mechanisms that underlie the persisting effects of traumatic stress response on the human prefrontal cortex.

 Modern colour image sensors face challenges in further improving sensitivity and image quality because of inherent limitations in light utilization efficiency1. A major factor contributing to these limitations is the use of passive optical filters, which absorb and dissipate a substantial amount of light, thereby reducing the efficiency of light capture2. On the contrary, active optical filtering in Foveon-type vertically stacked architectures still struggles to deliver optimal performance owing to their lack of colour selectivity, making them inefficient for precise colour imaging3. Here we introduce an innovative architecture for colour sensor arrays that uses multilayer monolithically stacked lead halide perovskite thin-film photodetectors. Perovskite bandgap tunability4 is utilized to selectively absorb the visible light spectrum’s red, green and blue regions, eliminating the need for colour filters. External quantum efficiencies of 50%, 47% and 53% are demonstrated for the red, green and blue channels, respectively, as well as a colour accuracy of 3.8% in ΔELab outperforming the state-of-the-art colour-filter array and Foveon-type photosensors. The image sensor design improves light utilization in colour sensors and paves the way for the next generation of highly sensitive, artefact-free images with enhanced colour fidelity.

 Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) persistently infects more than 90% of the human population, causing infectious mononucleosis1, susceptibility to autoimmune diseases2 and multiple malignancies of epithelial or B cell-origin3. EBV infects epithelial cells and B cells through interaction between viral glycoproteins and different host receptors4, but it has remained unknown whether a common receptor mediates infection of its two major host cell targets. Here, we establish R9AP as a crucial EBV receptor for entry into epithelial and B cells. R9AP silencing or knockout, R9AP-derived peptide and R9AP monoclonal antibody each significantly inhibit, whereas R9AP overexpression promotes, EBV uptake into both cell types. R9AP binds directly to the EBV glycoprotein gH/gL complex to initiate gH/gL–gB-mediated membrane fusion. Notably, the interaction of R9AP with gH/gL is inhibited by the highly competitive gH/gL-neutralizing antibody AMMO1, which blocks EBV epithelial and B cell entry. Moreover, R9AP mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion in cooperation with EBV gp42–human leukocyte antigen class II or gH/gL–EPHA2 complexes in B cells or epithelial cells, respectively. We propose R9AP as the crucial common receptor of B cells and epithelial cells and a potential prophylactic and vaccine target for EBV.

 Equitable coverage and reliable operation of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are crucial for a just transition to a carbon-free future.

Here, we utilize real-world reviews (n = 470,142) from a user-generated content platform to analyze public EVCSs at the census tract level.

Additionally, EVCS users in DACs and urban areas experience significantly more reliability issues compared to those in non-DACs and rural areas, primarily related to hardware and technical failures.

 Montane birds represent a large proportion of global avian biodiversity and are highly sensitive to seasonal climatic shifts. Many montane species undertake elevational migration in response to seasonal climate change, but how they cope with disparate environmental pressures along the elevational gradient is poorly understood. Here, we investigate phenotypic plasticity in two closely related elevational migrants that differ in their seasonal movements (small-scale vs. large-scale elevational migrants). Through common-garden experiments with adult male birds of these species, we compared gene and protein expression plasticity in response to changes in temperature and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). The small-scale elevational migrant exhibited greater plasticity in response to changes in temperature, and the large-scale elevational migrant exhibited greater plasticity in response to changes in PO2. These findings correspond to annual variation in environmental conditions experienced by each species, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity may co-vary with the seasonal elevational distributions of these elevational migrants.

This study describes how the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 protects genome stability by preventing premature TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination. 
 The eukaryotic replisome, which consists of the CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS (CMG) helicase, replicative polymerases, and several accessory factors, sometimes encounters proteinaceous obstacles that threaten genome integrity. These obstacles are targeted for removal or proteolysis by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP, which associates with the replisome. However, TRAIP must be carefully regulated to avoid inappropriate ubiquitylation and disassembly of the replisome. Here, we demonstrate that human cells lacking the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 are hypersensitive to topoisomerase poisons and other replication stress-inducing agents. Furthermore, TRAIP loss rescues the hypersensitivity of USP37 knockout cells to topoisomerase inhibitors. In Xenopus egg extracts depleted of USP37, TRAIP promotes premature CMG ubiquitylation and disassembly when converging replisomes stall. Finally, guided by AlphaFold-Multimer, we discovered that binding to CDC45 mediates USP37’s response to topological stress. We propose that USP37 protects genome stability by preventing TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination.

Here, the authors show that blocking ribosomal RNA production by rapid depletion of RNase MRP induces a long-lasting quiescence-like state in human cells. 
 Cellular quiescence is a state of reversible proliferative arrest that plays essential roles in development, resistance to stress, aging, and longevity of organisms. Here we report that rapid depletion of RNase MRP, a deeply conserved RNA-based enzyme required for rRNA biosynthesis, induces a long-term yet reversible proliferative arrest in human cells. Severely compromised biogenesis of rRNAs along with acute transcriptional reprogramming precede a gradual decline of the critical cellular functions. Unexpectedly, many arresting cells show increased levels of histone mRNAs, which accumulate locally in the cytoplasm, and S-phase DNA amount. The ensuing proliferative arrest is entered from multiple stages of the cell cycle and can last for several weeks with uncompromised cell viability. Strikingly, restoring expression of RNase MRP leads to a complete reversal of the arrested state with resumed cell proliferation at the speed of control cells. We suggest that targeting rRNA biogenesis may provide a general strategy for rapid induction of a reversible proliferative arrest, with implications for understanding and manipulating cellular quiescence.

 Steroidal alkaloids play a crucial role in plant defense and exhibit distinct stereochemistry at C25, forming either the tomato-type (25S) or eggplant-type (25R) isomers. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanisms shaping this stereochemical diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM 8 (GAME8) cytochrome P450 hydroxylases across the Solanaceae family revealed two distinct clades producing either 25S or 25R isomers. Ancestral GAME8 likely favored 25R, with gene duplications giving rise to 25S-producing enzymes in more recent Solanum species. In S. nigrum and S. dulcamara, multiple GAME8 copies generate mixed isomeric profiles. Notably, in wild S. cheesmaniae from the Galápagos, mutations in GAME8 have driven a shift from 25S back to the ancestral 25R, suggesting reverse evolution. Our findings highlight how GAME8 evolution has shaped alkaloid diversity in the genus Solanum, demonstrating a complex interplay between enzyme function, genetic variation, and evolutionary adaptation.

 Aircraft emissions of (ultra)fine particles during landing and take-off operations pose increasing human health hazards for airport employees and near-airport communities. Measurements of in-operation aircraft are therefore crucial for characterizing real-world aircraft emissions, and their variability. In this work, we develop an approach that enables the gathering of large quantities of data on real-world aircraft-specific emissions. We use three types of portable PM sensors located ca. 200 m downwind of an operational runway at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, over different seasons, to characterize the plumes from ca. 500 specific operations covering most aircraft types of the global flying fleet. High concentration peaks (in the order of 106 particles/cm3) of sub-25 nm particles are observed in the near field. While departure plumes exhibit higher particle number concentrations than arrival plumes, the values do not necessarily scale with aircraft size or engine thrust rating.

 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects sea surface temperatures (SSTs) around the world with varying degrees of influence. Dynamical understanding of global SST responses to ENSO has progressed substantially, but is far from complete. We propose a novel modelling approach, and use it to investigate why SSTs along Australia’s southeast coast are modulated by ENSO much less strongly than along Australia’s west coast. Combining tropical Pacific pacemaker ensemble simulations and ocean model perturbation experiments, this modelling approach identifies and compares the contributions of different mechanisms for the two regions. Off Australia’s west coast, the strong ENSO signature in SST variability is dominated by remote tropical Pacific ENSO-driven wind stress forcing via oceanic teleconnections, with smaller contributions from non-ENSO climate variability. However, off the southeast coast, the contribution from remote tropical Pacific ENSO-driven wind stress forcing is largely offset by the thermodynamic ENSO-driven buoyancy forcing locally within the Coral and Tasman Sea. This resultant weak ENSO signature in SST is further weakened by non-ENSO climate variability."

 Anthropogenic land use and land cover changes (LULCC) have profound impacts on land water availability, defined as precipitation (P) minus evapotranspiration (ET), through biophysical pathways. However, such impacts have long been debated mostly due to either the inadequate consideration of the atmospheric feedbacks arising from the changes in circulations and background climate in observation-based studies or unrealistic representation of historical LULCC in idealized-simulation-based studies. To overcome these limitations, we use the latest simulations from multiple Earth system models to investigate the impacts of historical (1850–2014) and future (2015–2100) LULCC on P–ET. Here we show that historical LULCC caused an insignificant reduction in global P–ET, mainly in wet regions. Locally, P–ET tends to decrease (increase) in deforestation (reforestation) regions mainly due to the dominant role of precipitation. Approximately 3.8% of the global land area (5.1 Mkm2) even has experienced opposite regime shifts, in which negative (positive) P–ET becomes positive (negative). Under a medium-to-high warming scenario, however, reforestation is projected to decrease P–ET even over reforested areas. This study not only elucidates the hydrological effects of realistic LULCC with atmospheric feedbacks being fully considered, but also highlights that the relative importance of the local effects and atmospheric feedbacks varies with background climate changes. We stress that background climate changes and feedbacks due to LULCC should be considered when planning reforestation and other land-use policies."

Results revealed that orographic clouds over the STP exhibit notably high SS levels, with an average SS of 0.36% and cloud case mean SS ranging from 0.1% to 1.27%. Such high SS compensates for the low hygroscopicity of Aitken-mode aerosols, facilitating their activation into cloud droplets. The resulting microphysical changes include increased droplet number concentrations, broader droplet spectra, and enhanced cloud liquid water content, which could promote collision-coalescence processes and precipitation formation. Moreover, these SS-induced microphysical changes may enhance cloud albedo and influence regional radiative forcing, potentially impacting atmospheric circulation and monsoon dynamics over the Tibetan Plateau. These findings highlight the critical role of high SS in cloud formation under conditions of weak aerosol activation potential, offering new insights into orographic cloud processes in high-altitude environments."

 Fundamental ecological questions about the distribution of ocean life remain unanswered, hindering both the effective management of the ocean, and our comprehension of life on this planet. The benthic and pelagic realms are subject to different methods of study, and to understand where to best focus effort, a thorough understanding of existing information is required, allowing identification of critical knowledge gaps. Open-access data repositories provide a valuable means to identify such gaps; however, these repositories are subject to challenges in separating benthic from pelagic data. Here we demonstrate an automated data pipeline for extracting and separating benthic from pelagic data in open-access repositories. By stratifying data against essential ocean variables in a critical gap analysis, we show that large spatial and taxonomic biases exist in both the benthic and pelagic global datasets, favouring depths shallower than ~100 m, the northern hemisphere, and vertebrate species. The newly compiled, cleaned, and classified dataset is used to identify areas of chronic under sampling and high-priority regions for exploration. We argue that coordinated strategic prioritisation of sampling is needed to support modelling and prediction, enabling us to better manage our oceans and comprehend life on Earth. Large spatial and taxonomic biases exist in ocean ecological datasets, with shallow depths, the northern hemisphere, and vertebrate species being favoured, according to a critical gap analysis of open-access datasets."

 The ratio of soil heterotrophic respiration to total soil respiration (Rh/Rs) is critical for soil carbon pool stability and atmosphere-biosphere exchanges, yet its spatiotemporal dynamics and responses to environmental drivers remain poorly constrained. Here, we estimate global soil and heterotrophic respiration by integrating ground observations with machine learning models. From 1980 to 2022, annual increases reached 0.76 and 0.54 g C m⁻² yr⁻² for soil and heterotrophic respiration, respectively. Globally, Rh/Rs averaged 61.30 ± 0.54% with a decadal rise of 0.13%. Rising soil temperature enhances Rh/Rs, while soil moisture suppresses it, exhibiting stronger global-scale influence. Temperature dominates Rh/Rs regulation in forests and shrublands, whereas moisture controls this ratio in grasslands and croplands. These findings elucidate ecosystem-specific mechanisms governing Rh/Rs dynamics, advancing predictions of soil carbon-climate feedbacks essential for carbon neutrality strategies.

 Passenger car carbon footprints are highly sensitive to future energy systems, a factor often overlooked in life cycle assessment. We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5–3.0 °C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important.

 Sea-air exchange of carbon dioxide in the Southern Ocean is strongly seasonal, with ocean uptake in summer, which is partly offset by carbon dioxide outgassing in winter. This seasonal balance can shift due to sea ice conditions, inducing interannual variability in the Southern Ocean carbon sink. A decade (2010–2020) of unique, year-round marine carbonate chemistry observations from the Rothera Time Series (West Antarctic Peninsula) reveals that interannual variability in seawater fugacity of carbon dioxide depends on wintertime processes. Sea ice duration controls ocean stratification, which acts as a gateway to the carbon-rich ocean interior. Consequently, years with persistent sea ice cover and high mean winter stratification absorb, on average, 20% more carbon dioxide than years with less sea ice and weaker stratification in winter. Wintertime marine observations are therefore essential to resolve critical processes and reliably quantify interannual variability of the sea-air carbon dioxide flux in seasonally sea ice-covered regions.

 Extreme states of the North Atlantic Oscillation in summer can lead to severe weather events such as heatwaves and floods in Europe. But how these extremes evolve in response to climate change remains unexplored. Here we show that the statistical distribution of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index grows wider with increasing global warming in large ensembles of climate change simulations as well as reanalysis data. Such an amplified variability of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation caused by global warming leads to a higher probability of summer North Atlantic Oscillation extremes — for both positive and negative phases — accompanied by an amplification of their impacts on surface temperature over northwestern Europe. Changes in summer North Atlantic Oscillation extremes highlight the effects of climate change on the transient behaviour of the atmosphere, and thus have important implications for extreme weather attribution.

 Grounded ice cliffs in Antarctica contribute directly to global sea level rise through calving, yet they are less studied compared to floating ice shelves. Traditional satellite remote sensing methods face limitations in temporal and spatial resolution for monitoring these small-scale calving events. This research aims to develop a method for fine-scale monitoring of grounded ice cliff calving using multi-temporal UAV photogrammetry without ground control points, with assistance from in-situ snow pit measurements. The methodology involves co-aligning UAV images to create consistent 3D models, followed by detecting calving events based on significant local volume changes between successive models. Noise filtering strategies were implemented to exclude outliers, and calving volume and mass were calculated using measurements of snow depth and density. Our method was conducted near the China’s Qinling Station on Inexpressible Island in Victoria Land, East Antarctica, and achieved a co-alignment accuracy of 2.69 cm. Over a 26-day observation period with 10 repeated flights, 44 calving events were identified along the coastline of 0.89 km, resulting in a total calving volume of 4506.69 m3 and a mass of 3078.45 tons. The average calving rate was determined to be 262.93 tons per kilometre per day along the coastline. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-scale monitoring of grounding ice-cliff calving using UAV photogrammetry in polar environments.

 We introduce a new instrument to measure spectral light absorption by aerosol particles. BLAnCA (Broadband Light Analyzer of Complex Aerosol) is an automatic laboratory instrument for offline measurement of aerosol collected on suitable media. BLAnCA is equipped with a white light source and a high-resolution spectrometer, and measures in the range between 375 and 1000 nm with a spectral resolution of 5 nm. This allows for the determination of fine structure of the absorption properties of a sampled aerosol, which can lead to improvement in the robustness and scope of source apportionment and the evaluation of climate-relevant properties such as the aerosol mass absorption cross-section. The new instrument has been validated against a multi-wavelength absorbance analyzer, obtaining an agreement of up to 99 % between absorption coefficient measurements. The absorption coefficient limit of detection for BLAnCA has been estimated at 1.20 Mm−1 (2.70 Mm−1) for standard EU (EPA) sampling conditions, corresponding to an elemental carbon detection limit of about 1.3 μg cm−2, if a mass absorption cross-section of 4.7 m2g−1 at 1000 nm is considered.

This study summarizes the progress of weather classification research in atmospheric pollution, focusing on the history, the characteristics and applicability of different research methods, the research conclusions on weather classification for different types of air pollution and their corresponding mechanisms, and points out the challenges of current research and the directions for future research. Driven by technological development and research needs, the research has generally gone through four stages of development, and the current objective classification method, especially the T-mode principal component analysis, show the superior performance. Local generation patterns contributing to PM2.5 pollution are characterized by stagnation conditions, while those contributing to O3 pollution are linked to high pressure which enhances the photochemical reaction, and low pressure accompanied by inversion.

Regional transport patterns of PM2.5 pollution are generally cold fronts and high pressure, while those of O3 pollution are mostly low pressure.

The results indicate that: (1) The synoptic pattern during this precipitation process followed a typical cold-season elevated thunderstorm structure, extending from upper layers to the surface. Strong echo height exceeding the −20 °C layer was the main reason for the formation of ice-phase particles and lightning. (2) Precipitation particles displayed different size-distribution models and disparate phases during the diverse precipitation stages. During the initial stage, the particle size distribution displayed a single-peak pattern, primarily composed of drizzle and ice pellets. In the development stage, the size distribution showed both single-peak and multi-peak patterns, with particles including freezing rain, graupel, and small ice crystals. During the subsequent stable snowfall stage, the precipitation was mainly consisted of various morphological ice crystals, graupel, and wet snow particles dominated by small solid particles with a diameter less than 1 mm, the peak number concentration was 0.69 mm in diameter, and their terminal velocities were stable at 1 m s−1.

In this study, we demonstrate an effective orbital gating of prototypical alkanethiol–based molecules with deeper orbital levels in vertical large-area mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) configuration that offers enhanced electrical bias stability and gating efficiency. By using ion gel gating in Au-molecule-graphene junction, the channel conductance could be modulated notably according to a clear transition from direct tunneling to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling regime. The mixed SAM molecular transistors also showed a superior gating efficiency due to the suppressed field screening effect by the net molecular dipole. This work is expected to contribute toward developing reliable three-terminal molecular device platform extended to molecules with deep orbital levels."

We found that effector CfEC92 fromC. fructicolaspecifically binds ATP through an unidentified ATP-binding domain, leading to changes in the protein secondary structure. The residues Cys26, Asn38, and Cys39were critical for ATP binding with CfEC92, and mutations at these sites impaired the ability to suppress host immunity. CfEC92 interacted with MdNDPK2, a negative immune regulator in apple. The CfEC92-ATP complex altered the conformation of MdNDPK2, enhancing its affinity for ATP, and further increasing its autophosphorylation and kinase activity. The activated MdNDPK2 phosphorylated MdMPK3 to suppress host immunity. Homology and functional tests showed that the Cx11NC motif was highly conserved amongColletotrichumspecies, suggesting that CNC effectors represent a class of broad-spectrum virulence factors. Our findings revealed a mechanism by whichColletotrichumeffectors cooperate with helper ATP to promote target protein phosphorylation and suppress host immunity."

Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified the Zinc Finger CCCH-Type Containing 4 protein (ZC3H4), a suppressor of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) production, as a pivotal player in this system. Experimentally, ZC3H4 deficiency led to increased DNA damage, abnormal mitosis, and cellular senescence. Biochemical analysis and super-resolution microscopy revealed that the loss of ZC3H4 increased replication stress (RS)—a major driver of genome instability—by inducing a hypertranscription state that promoted R loop formation and transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), both of which drive RS. Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that ZC3H4 preferentially binds to genomic regions prone to TRCs and R loops, where it suppresses ncRNA bursts, functioning as part of the Restrictor complex. Our findings identify ZC3H4 as a crucial factor in maintaining genome integrity, strategically positioned at the critical intersection of DNA and RNA synthesis."

The interaction between the disordered amino-terminal domain of PXN and the carboxyl-terminal targeting domain of FAK (FAT) is necessary and sufficient for localizing FAK to focal adhesions. Furthermore, PXN serves as a platform for recruiting other proteins that together control the dynamic changes needed for cell migration and survival. Here, we show that the PXN N-domain undergoes significant compaction upon FAT binding, forming a 48-kilodalton multimodal complex with four major interconverting states. Although the complex is flexible, each state has unique sets of contacts involving disordered regions that are both highly represented in ensembles and conserved.

Thus, characteristic emergent rules of collective migration can arise from cell-cell contacts locally tweaking architecture, orchestrating self-regulation during development, wound healing, and cancer progression. TheDrosophilatestis-nascent-myotube system allows dissection of contact-dependent migration in vivo at high resolution. Here, we describe a role for the axon guidance factor Plexin A in collective cell migration: maintaining cell-cell interfaces at a precise point on the mesenchymal-to-epithelial continuum. This is crucial for testis myotubes to migrate as a continuous sheet, allowing normal sculpting-morphogenesis. Cells must maintain filopodial N-cadherin–based junctions and remain ECM-tethered near cell-cell contacts to spread while collectively moving. Our data further suggest Semaphorin 1b is a Plexin A antagonist, fine-tuning activation. This reveals a contact-dependent mechanism to maintain sheet integrity during migration, driving organ morphogenesis. This is relevant for mesenchymal organ sculpting in other migratory contexts such as angiogenesis."

Here, we tested this hypothesis in mice modeling the human CaV1.3A749Gmutation that causes low-voltage Ca2+channel activation. We demonstrate activation of Ca2+influx and glutamate release of IHC AZs at lower voltages, increased spontaneous firing in SGNs, and lower sound threshold of CaV1.3A749G/A749Gmice. Loss of synaptic ribbons in IHCs at ambient sound levels of mouse husbandry indicates that low-voltage Ca2+channel activation poses a risk for noise-induced synaptic damage.

We demonstrate that the RNA demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) drives glutamine reprogramming to support ccRCC growth and survival. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of FTO in ccRCC cells impaired glutamine-derived reductive carboxylation, depleted pyrimidines, and increased reactive oxygen species. This led to increased DNA damage and reduced survival, which could be rescued by pyrimidine nucleobases or the antioxidantN-acetylcysteine. Mechanistically, FTO demethylates the glutamine transporter solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5) messenger RNA to promote its expression. Restoration of SLC1A5 expression in FTO-knockdown cells rescued metabolic and survival defects. FTO inhibition reduced ccRCC tumor xenograft and PDX growth under the renal capsule.

Notably, despite recognizing the same avirulence factor,RTSWgenes fromN. alataandSw-5bfromSolanum peruvianumhave evolved independently of adjacent nonorthologous ancestral loci. Our work illustrates the potential of wild relative genomes as resources from which to precisely introduce disease resistance into cultivated crops."

Beard;Jing Gu;Isaac Hendrix,Highly enantioselective synthesis controlled by spin-exchange interaction,"We present a strategy to achieve absolute asymmetric catalysis that is effectively controlled by an external magnetic field via a spin-exchange reaction leveraging the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect. Using an external magnetic field to achieve asymmetric synthesis has long been desired. Here, we demonstrate 90% enantiomeric excess (ee) in [3 + 2] cycloadditions and 89% ee in aldol reactions, where the handedness of the product is determined by the ~±150 mT external magnetic polarization of a ferromagnet (FM). Our approach uses an enantioselective crystallization of racemic catalysts on a FM surface, using a small-scale crystallization vial connected to a bulk racemic solution. Racemic catalysts controllably crystallize into their respective enantiopure forms and are directly used in asymmetric reactions. Thus, we demonstrate that an external magnetic field can serve as a versatile symmetry-breaking tool to achieve highly enantioselective organic synthesis eliminating the need of any enantioenriched reagents."

Although current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and a large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N2and the ground state properties of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wave functions. Our results suggest that, for current error rates, a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture can tackle challenging chemistry problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization."

While natural glycosylation may mitigate aggregation, its efficacy and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood due to limited access to homogeneous samples with complex glycans. This study addresses these knowledge gaps by investigating the natural glycosylation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a peptide with therapeutic potential for type 2 diabetes but problematic aggregation. An optimized chemical synthesis enabled preparation of diverse IAPP glycoforms with complex glycan structures, allowing systematic evaluation of their effects on aggregation, cytotoxicity, and solubility. Sialylated glycans at Thr30completely inhibited IAPP aggregation, eliminated cytotoxicity toward pancreatic β cells, and enhanced solubility by up to 280-fold. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations revealed that glycosylation impedes adoption of a four-stranded β-sheet conformation in IAPP dimers. These findings advance the understanding of the role of natural glycosylation in aggregation and highlight its potential as an evolutionarily inspired strategy to enhance the therapeutic utility of IAPP."

Injection of PD patient–derived α-syn in nonhuman primates has illustrated the exquisite vulnerability of primate dopaminergic neurons. Here, we aimed to elucidate the temporal and spatial pathological changes induced by two distinct α-syn pathogenic structures, having large or small sizes. To unravel the underlying molecular pathways, we conducted a proteomic analysis of the putamen and the entorhinal cortex, two brain regions carrying notable α-syn pathology. We demonstrate that distinct assemblies of α-syn aggregates drive unique pathogenic changes that ultimately result in a comparable extent of nigrostriatal degeneration at the level of nigral dopaminergic neuron cell bodies and striatal dopaminergic terminals. More broadly, our findings identify pathogenic trajectories associated with large or small α-syn aggregates, suggesting the existence of several possible concomitant pathogenic routes in PD."

However, a key limitation for terahertz-scale integrated VPC-based devices has been the absence of arbitrary bend interconnects, as traditional VPC-designs restricted to principal lattice axes (i.e., only 0°, 60°, or 120°) due to crystalline symmetry. Here, we present an on-chip, all-silicon implementation of deformed VPCs that enable robust transmission along arbitrary shapes and bends. Although the lattice is amorphous and lacks long-range periodicity, the topological protection is sustained by short-range order. Furthermore, we show an amorphous lattice functioning as a frequency-dependent router, splitting input signals into two perpendicular output ports. We also demonstrate on-chip terahertz communication, achieving data rates of up to 72 Gbps. Our findings show that amorphous topological photonic crystals enhance interconnect adaptability while preserving performance."

Current diffusion-driven, resin-based purification techniques constrain productivity and rely on expensive oligo(dT) ligands for target ss-mRNA poly(A) tail hybridization. To overcome these challenges, we use interfacial molecular forces, such as charge and hydrogen bonds, between nucleic acid variants and a positively charged synthetic microporous membrane to purify ss-mRNA, a desirable therapeutic, from an undesirable impurity, immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Membranes achieved high binding capacities (1.28 mg/m2) and up to 100% ss-mRNA recovery at ~pH 9.0, with optimized surface density (4000 to 10,000 nmol/m2). Purification was operated at rapid flow rates (1.5 ml/min,1000 MV/min) with reusability (>10 trials) and negligible ligand leaching. The key discovery of this cost-effective ligand-less multimodal surface-modified approach is that the addition of the polyamine spermine, which selectively neutralizes dsRNA charge at amine-to-phosphate ratios >450, enhanced separation efficiency."

However, the interconnected determinants of diseases suggest that we need a science of health, a framework to examine the biology of homeodynamics in a changing environment and how this affects the health we value. We build on first principles and recent discoveries on biological system dynamics to develop the concept of intrinsic health, a field-like state emerging from the dynamic interplay of energy, communication, and structure within the organism, giving rise to robustness/resilience, plasticity, performance, and sustainability. Intrinsic health is a quantifiable property of individuals that declines with age and interacts with context. We propose a measurement framework and describe how it will contribute to achieving the shared goals of medicine and public health."
