10.5194/gmd-2024-126,"HTAP3 Fires: Towards a multi-model, multi-pollutant study of fire impacts","The multi-model experiment design of the HTAP3 Fires project takes a multi-pollutant approach to improving our understanding of transboundary transport of wildland fire and agricultural burning emissions and their impacts. The experiments are designed with the goal of answering science policy questions related to fires. The options for the multi-model approach, including inputs, outputs, and model set up are discussed, and the official recommendations for the project are presented. 
 Open biomass burning has major impacts globally and regionally on atmospheric composition. Fire emissions include particulate matter, tropospheric ozone precursors, greenhouse gases, as well as persistent organic pollutants, mercury and other metals. Fire frequency, intensity, duration, and location are changing as the climate warms, and modelling these fires and their impacts is becoming more and more critical to inform climate adaptation and mitigation, as well as land management. Indeed, the air pollution from fires can reverse the progress made by emission controls on industry and transportation. At the same time, nearly all aspects of fire modelling – such as emissions, plume injection height, long-range transport, and plume chemistry – are highly uncertain. This paper outlines a multi-model, multi-pollutant, multi-regional study to improve the understanding of the uncertainties and variability in fire atmospheric science, models, and fires’ impacts, in addition to providing quantitative estimates of the air pollution and radiative impacts of biomass burning. Coordinated under the auspices of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution, the international atmospheric modelling and fire science communities are working towards the common goal of improving global fire modelling and using this multi-model experiment to provide estimates of fire pollution for impact studies. This paper outlines the research needs, opportunities, and options for the fire-focused multi-model experiments and provides guidance for these modelling experiments, outputs, and analysis that are to be pursued over the next 3 to 5 years. It proposes a plan for delivering specific products at key points over this period to meet important milestones relevant to science and policy audiences.",Cynthia H. Whaley;Tim Butler;Jose A.

10.1021/acs.est.4c05048,Important yet Overlooked HONO Source from Aqueous-phase Photochemical Oxidation of Nitrophenols,"Nitrites (NO2–/HONO), as the primary source of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in the atmosphere, play a key role in atmospheric chemistry. However, the current understanding of the source of NO2–/HONO is insufficient and therefore hinders the accurate quantification of atmospheric oxidation capacity. Herein, we highlighted an overlooked HONO source by the reaction between nitrophenols (NPs) and •OH in the aqueous phase and provided kinetic data to better evaluate the contribution of this process to atmospheric HONO. Three typical NPs, including 4-nitrophenol (4NP), 2-nitrophenol (2NP), and 4-nitrocatechol (4NC), underwent a denitration process to form aqueous NO2– and gaseous HONO through the •OH oxidation, with the yield of NO2–/HONO varied from 15.0 to 33.5%. According to chemical composition and structure analysis, the reaction pathway, where the ipso addition of •OH to the NO2 group on 4NP generated hydroquinone, can contribute to more than 61.9% of the NO2–/HONO formation. The aqueous photooxidation of NPs may account for HONO in the atmosphere, depending on the specific conditions. The results clearly suggest that the photooxidation of NPs should be considered in the field observation and calculation to better evaluate the HONO budget in the atmosphere.",Wangjin Yang;Hui Ji;Fu Li;Xue He;Shan Zhang;Xiangli Nan;Tao Du;Kun Li;Chong Han,Environmental Science & Technology,True,"['atmospheric chemistry', 'HONO', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition', 'photochemical oxidation', 'nitrophenols', 'aqueous phase']",该研究关注大气中亚硝酸 (HONO) 的来源，HONO 是大气中羟基自由基 (•OH) 的主要来源，在氧化能力方面起着关键作用。研究发现，硝基酚 (NPs) 在水相中与 •OH 反应会产生 HONO，这是一种被忽视的 HONO 来源。研究通过实验确定了三种典型 NPs 的硝化反应速率，并分析了反应路径。研究结果表明，NPs 的光氧化可能会对大气中的 HONO 产生影响，需要在实地观测和计算中考虑 NPs 的光氧化过程，以更好地评估大气中 HONO 的收支。
10.1021/acsestair.4c00141,"Chemical Insights into the Molecular Composition of Organic Aerosols in the Urban Region of Houston, Texas","Molecular functional groups, such as organosulfates (CHOS) and organonitrates (CHNO) are important tracers for field observations of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). While CHOS and CHNO are prevalent in the atmosphere, there is a lack of knowledge regarding daily and day- and night-time variations in these species in the urban atmosphere. Meteorological factors such as wind speed/direction, relative humidity (RH), and temperature can influence the formation of CHOS/CHNO. To investigate these trends, we utilized multimodal chemical imaging and advanced high resolution mass spectrometry techniques to acquire particle speciation and molecular formulas (MFs) associated with day and night sampling periods. Back trajectory analyses revealed the oceanic influence of southern wind airmasses in later June sampling periods with organic fractions <10%. Conversely, northern winds in early June sampling periods contributed to the episodic emergence of extremely low volatile organics (ELVOCs) and organic factions up to 41%. The observed unique MFs to June 3 (223 MFs) and to June 4 (144 MFs) were largely found to be of biogenic rather than anthropogenic origin.

 At the origin of the Universe, an asymmetry between the amount of created matter and antimatter led to the matter-dominated Universe as we know it today. The origins of this asymmetry remain unknown so far. High-energy nuclear collisions create conditions similar to the Universe microseconds after the Big Bang, with comparable amounts of matter and antimatter1–6. Much of the created antimatter escapes the rapidly expanding fireball without annihilating, making such collisions an effective experimental tool to create heavy antimatter nuclear objects and to study their properties7–14, hoping to shed some light on the existing questions on the asymmetry between matter and antimatter.

 Human development relies on the correct replication, maintenance and segregation of our genetic blueprints. How these processes are monitored across embryonic lineages, and why genomic mosaicism varies during development remain unknown. Using pluripotent stem cells, we identify that several patterning signals—including WNT, BMP, and FGF—converge into the modulation of DNA replication stress and damage during S-phase, which in turn controls chromosome segregation fidelity in mitosis. We show that the WNT and BMP signals protect from excessive origin firing, DNA damage and chromosome missegregation derived from stalled forks in pluripotency. Cell signalling control of chromosome segregation declines during lineage specification into the three germ layers, but re-emerges in neural progenitors. In particular, we find that the neurogenic factor FGF2 induces DNA replication stress-mediated chromosome missegregation during the onset of neurogenesis, which could provide a rationale for the elevated chromosomal mosaicism of the developing brain. Our results highlight roles for morphogens and cellular identity in genome maintenance that contribute to somatic mosaicism during mammalian development.

10.1038/s41467-024-51677-z,Variations in plume activity reveal the dynamics of water-filled faults on Enceladus,"Cassini mission revealed water-rich plumes, with temporal variation, near the south pole of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Here, the authors show combination of slip-controlled jet flow and normal-stress-controlled ambient flow can explain the temporal variability of Enceladus’ plumes. 
 After discovering a jet activity near the south pole of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, the Cassini mission demonstrated the existence of a subsurface water ocean with a unique sampling opportunity through flybys. Diurnal variations in the observed brightness of the plume suggest a tidal control, although the existence and timing of two activity maxima seem to contradict stress analysis predictions. Here, we re-interpret the observed plume variability by combining a 3D global model of tidal deformation of the fractured ice shell with a 1D local model of transport processes within south-polar faults. Our model successfully predicts the observed plume’s temporal variability by combining two independent vapour transport mechanisms: slip-controlled jet flow and normal-stress-controlled ambient flow. Moreover, it provides a possible explanation for the differences between the vapour and solid emission rates during the diurnal cycle and the observed fractionation of the various icy particle families. Our model prediction could be tested by future JWST observations targeted when Enceladus is at different positions on its orbit and could be used to determine the optimal strategy for plume material sampling by future space missions.

 Functional blockade of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signalling pathway improves the efficacy of cytotoxic and immunotherapies. Here, we conducted a phase 1b study (ClinicalTrials.gov., NCT03143985) to determine the primary endpoints of safety, tolerability, and maximal tolerated dose (200 mg twice daily) for the orally-available TGFβ type I receptor kinase inhibitor vactosertib in combination with pomalidomide in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients who had received ≥2 lines of chemoimmunotherapy. Secondary endpoints demonstrated sustained clinical responses, favorable pharmacokinetic parameters and a 6-month progression-free survival of 82%. Vactosertib combined with pomalidomide was well-tolerated at all dose levels and displayed a manageable adverse event profile. Exploratory analysis indicated that vactosertib co-treatment with pomalidomide also reduced TGFβ levels in patient bone marrow as well as the level of CD8+ T-cells that expressed the immunoinhibitory marker PD-1. In vitro experiments indicated that vactosertib+pomalidomide co-treatment decreased the viability of MM cell lines and patient tumor cells, and increased CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic activity. Vactosertib is a safe therapeutic that demonstrates tumor-intrinsic activity and can overcome immunosuppressive challenges within the tumor microenvironment to reinvigorate T-cell fitness. Vactosertib offers promise to improve immunotherapeutic responses in heavily-pretreated MM patients refractory to conventional agents.
