10.1021/acs.est.5c04083,False,Environmental Science & Technology,该论文主要研究微塑料在海洋环境中光照下释放的溶解性有机物（MPs-DOM）的转化过程，以及微塑料的尺寸和结构如何影响这一过程。研究重点在于不同类型和尺寸的微塑料（聚乙烯PE和聚丙烯PP）在模拟日光照射的海水中，经过180天的老化实验后，MPs-DOM的动态变化特征。论文分析了MPs-DOM的成分变化，包括蛋白质类物质的产生和生物可利用性成分向生物难降解分子的转化，并探讨了这些变化对海洋碳循环的潜在影响。总的来说，该研究关注的是海洋环境中的塑料污染和有机碳循环，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Yan-Jun Liu;Zhao Liang Chen;Zekun Zhang;Yuanbi Yi;Ruanhong Cai;Ming Ye;Mengyang Liu;Meng Yan;Kenneth Mei Yee Leung;Tanveer M. Adyel;Ding He,Size and Structure-Dependent Molecular Fingerprint Transformation of Microplastic-Derived Dissolved Organic Matter in Sunlit Seawater: Implication for Marine Carbon Cycles,"Microplastics (MPs) widely pollute marine environments, where the release of MPs-derived dissolved organic matter (MPs-DOM) induced by UV irradiation has been widely documented. However, the effect of MPs’ inherent properties on photochemical transformation of MPs-DOM and its implication for oceanic carbon cycles remain poorly understood. Herein, we conducted 180 day artificial weathering experiments under sunlit seawater using polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) with different sizes as models, investigating the temporally dynamic features of MPs-DOM. Results showed that PP can release more MPs-DOM than PE, and concentrations of MPs-DOM derived from small-sized MPs (∼250 μm) were 2–6 times higher than those of large-sized MPs (∼5 mm). Spectroscopy and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrum further revealed that protein-like substances can be persistently produced from MPs with lower photochemical activity (i.e., PE and large-size PP), while DOM derived from MPs with higher photochemical activity (i.e., small-size PP) could be gradually transformed from biolabile components to biorecalcitrant molecules. Furthermore, the persistently accumulated molecules were matched and projected onto an aquatic DOM database, and their relative intensity exhibited a gradually increasing trend across the river-to-ocean continuum at the molecular level. This work reveals the structure–reactivity relationships for MPs-DOM transformation and highlights MPs’ potential impact in marine organic carbon cycles."

Loveless;Christian Klimczak,Several Kilometers of Global Contraction on Mercury: A Sample‐Size Independent Assessment of Fault Strain,"Mercury underwent global contraction due to the sustained cooling of the planet. Positive‐relief landforms, found widespread across Mercury, are thought to be the surface expressions of thrust faults accommodating the contraction. Disagreement exists in the literature on the amount of contraction, with estimates of radius change ranging from ∼1 to 7 km. These differences solely arise from the method used to estimate the fault population strain, which relies on the number of structures. Here, we adapt a previous framework by which the continuum approximation to shortening strains can be determined from fault length and displacement statistics for an incompletely sampled fault population. We apply this method to three data sets that sample different numbers of faults. Our results show that even for conservative fault parameters, 2 to 3.5 km of radial contraction are returned, irrespective of the data set used, and thus resolve the debate on the amount of global contraction on Mercury."

Fitting the RO to observations and climate model simulations consistently suggests that ENSO is a damped oscillator whose variability is sustained and made irregular by external weather noise. We investigate the methods that have been used to estimate the growth rate of ENSO by applying them to simulations of both damped and self‐sustained RO regimes. We find that fitting a linear RO leads to parameters that imply a damped oscillator even when the fitted data were produced by a model that is self‐sustained. Fitting a nonlinear RO also leads to a significant bias toward the damped regime. As such, it seems challenging to decide whether ENSO is a damped or a self‐sustained oscillation by fitting such models to observations, and the possibility that ENSO is self‐sustained cannot be ruled out."

Cloud uptake of weak acids, which is more effective under less acidity conditions, has attracted increasing interest. This study assessed how and to what extent nitrous acid (HONO) uptake impacted present‐day cloud chemistry. A gas‐cloudwater partitioning scheme with subsequent oxidation reactions for HONO was developed and implemented, and HONO heterogeneous chemistry was updated in the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ). The modified CMAQ was employed to quantify the effect of HONO uptake on cloudwater acidity and acidity‐dependent chemical processes during the June 2021 Michigan‐Ontario Ozone Source Experiment campaign. Our model results indicated that HONO uptake could lower cloudwater pH, especially in clouds with pH > 5, by 0.1 or larger and produce non‐negligible changes in both total ion concentrations and ion composition. These results were corroborated for a cloud event by available measurements at the Whiteface Mountain (WFM) monitoring site in New York State. Simulations indicated cloud uptake of 10% of gaseous HONO (HONO(g)) during the event, suggesting a potential sink for HONO(g) and likely resulting in a 0.1 unit decrease in cloudwater pH. Subsequently, ammonium (NH4+) volatilization was suppressed, which reduced NH4+ underestimation by up to 10%. In addition, simulated nitrite concentrations were averaged 10 μeq/L, in agreement with previous measurement studies. This study highlighted the importance of accurately representing weak acids in chemical transport models to improve understanding of present‐day cloud chemistry."

The middle atmosphere responses above and in the lee of the mountain ridge were observed by the Airborne Lidar for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALIMA) onboard the German High‐Altitude and Long‐Range research aircraft (HALO), which provided temperature measurements with both high horizontal (∼ ${\sim} $10 km) and high vertical (1.5 km) resolution. The observations reveal a complex wave field with multiple superimposed wave packets with horizontal scales λh ${\lambda }_{\mathrm{h}}$ ranging from ∼ ${\sim} $33 to 395 km. This paper employs spectral analysis of observational data and results of Fourier ray modeling to decompose the wave field and analyze the scales and properties of gravity wave packets. Profiles of the vertical flux of horizontal mountain wave momentum reveal contributions of each wave packet to the total momentum flux and gravity wave drag. The derived momentum flux spectrum suggests a spectral response of the form λhx ${\lambda }_{\mathrm{h}}^{x}$ with the exponent in the range −1.0 ${-}1.0$ to −1.2 ${-}1.2$ and peak momentum flux occurring at approximately λh=45km ${\lambda }_{\mathrm{h}}=45\hspace*{.5em}\mathrm{k}\mathrm{m}$.

Meanwhile, the development of deep learning (DL) technology has enabled the generation of reasonably accurate “future observations.” Among all these “future observations,” weather radar echo extrapolation (WREE) data derived from DL can be utilized to predict the development of convective systems, which is valuable for weather forecasts. Based on a DL model, which combines the residual convolution long short‐term memory (rcLSTM) network with the innovative framework of a generative adversarial network (GAN) named GAN‐rcLSTM, this study extrapolates the S‐band radar echo mosaics at 3‐km altitude from seven radars in Guangdong and assesses the performance of the GAN‐rcLSTM model. After confirming the good performance of the DL model, DA experiments are designed to explore the possibility of assimilating WREE data and assess its impact on the NWP. The results show that assimilating WREE data or radar echo observations (REOs) data can lead to a reduction in the reflectivity errors for both the analysis and forecast fields, which consequently improves the reflectivity distribution on analyses and forecasts. Additionally, assimilating WREE data not only has positive impacts on the location and intensity of precipitation but also improves the precipitation critical success index (CSI), which is similar to REOs assimilation results. Therefore, assimilating WREE data can achieve similar positive impacts compared to assimilating REOs data, offering a novel approach to improve the short‐term forecasts from NWP."

Melsen,How Climate Model Developers Deal With Bugs,"General circulation models (GCMs) are not only powerful tools to understand Earth's climate system and to forecast the weather. They are also large software programs written by humans. As such, they contain coding mistakes, so‐called bugs. Researchers communicate results generated with GCMs and document new model versions, but seldom explicitly communicate the bugs they find in their models, let alone the practices surrounding them. This study portrays practices around bugs that were found during recent ICON development, and the workflow from getting a suspicion to fixing and communicating the bug. Eleven qualitative in‐depth interviews were conducted with domain scientists and scientific programmers involved in ICON development. The interviews detail the workflow for dealing with bugs, highlighting that it is only partly standardized. For example, scientific testing is complicated by the fact that there is no absolute truth in terms of results that the model could be tested against. Thus testing resists standardization, so that dealing with bugs remains a laborious process. Being confronted and dealing with bugs, modelers aim for a model that is “good enough” rather than perfect. This stance is pragmatic and relaxes exuberant expectations for GCMs, especially considering their bugs. However, the goal of “good enough” is troubling with regard to GCMs' use as universal tools, with high societal stakes. Who decides that the model is “good enough,” and what for?"

 Gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility and associated conditions affect over 20% of population, yet pharmacological, behavioural, and surgical interventions offer limited therapeutic efficacy. Targeted electrical stimulation addressing underlying neuromuscular pathology stands to transform our ability to treat dysmotility. Here, we developed a closed-loop GI neuroprosthesis which activates or relaxes GI tract musculature through electrochemical stimulation in response to sensed food stimuli. We additionally describe a tool supporting minimally invasive endoscopically guided implantation that can penetrate the mucosa, accurately localize the submucosa, and safely deploy this device to directly interface with the enteric nervous system. The neuroprosthesis enables generation of coordinated peristaltic waves, significantly increasing the motility rate in a swine model of oesophageal and stomach dysmotility (p < 0.05, student’s t-test). Further, by directly modulating the myenteric plexus and thus mimicking meal ingestion, we induce peristalsis in a fasted state and achieve a metabolic response commensurate with a fed or satiated state. This neuroprosthesis and implantation platform expand opportunities in fundamental studies and treatments of metabolic and neuromuscular pathologies affecting the GI tract.

Here, the authors show that platelet actin disassembly is a key step that enables a receptor to translocate to membrane lipid rafts, enhancing its adhesive function under shear stress. 
 Mechano-dependent interactions are key to thrombus formation and hemostasis, enabling stable platelet adhesion to injured vessels. The interaction between von Willebrand factor (VWF) and the platelet receptor GPIb-IX-V is central to this process. While GPIbα connects to the actin cytoskeleton, whether actin dynamics are important for GPIbα function under hemodynamic, high shear conditions remains largely unknown. Here, we show that actin disassembly is critical for proper VWF-GPIbα binding under shear. Mechanistically, we identify the oxidoreductase MICAL1 as a shear-activated regulator that promotes local F-actin disassembly around the GPIb-IX-V complex. This enables its translocation to lipid rafts and reinforces VWF binding. MICAL1-deficient platelets display impaired adhesion, increased deformability under shear, and defective thrombus formation in vivo. Thus, MICAL1 drives shear-dependent actin remodeling that supports GPIb-IX-V mechanotransduction and platelet function. These findings uncover a role for actin oxidation in platelet adhesion, providing a connection between cytoskeletal redox control and platelet function during thrombus formation. To stop bleeding from an injured vessel, platelets adhere and form a clot despite high shear stress from the flow.

 Circular RNA (circRNA) has gained significant attention in RNA therapeutics due to its enhanced stability and protein-coding potential. In this study, we present two in vitro RNA circularization techniques, namely Permuted Intron-Exon through Trans-splicing (PIET) and Complete self-splicing Intron for RNA Circularization (CIRC). PIET leverages the second step of group I intron splicing, offering an alternative circularization strategy. CIRC utilizes the natural, intact forms of group I and group II introns, eliminating the need for intron engineering. Compared to Permuted Intron-Exon (PIE), CIRC exhibits enhanced RNA circularization efficiency and speed under mild conditions. Using CIRC, we successfully circularize large RNA constructs encoding full-length dystrophin, a protein whose deficiency is linked to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), thus overcoming size limitations typically associated with circRNA platforms. Notably, CIRC enables the production of scarless circRNA and circRNA with minimal immunogenicity. Additionally, CIRC supports streamlined circRNA purification using ribonuclease R (RNase R) or oligo(dT)-based methods. These advancements significantly expand the potential of the circRNA platform for both research and therapeutic applications. RNA circularization is vital for circRNA therapeutics.

 Accurate identification of winter wheat from remote sensing imagery is crucial for large-scale agricultural monitoring. Despite the success of Transformer-based deep learning models in various fields, their application in crop identification has been limited by the scarcity of extensive labeled training data. This study proposes a dual-branch spatio-temporal Transformer (DST-Transformer) for winter wheat extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery using a small training dataset. By independently extracting temporal and spatial features, the DST-Transformer effectively delineates crop boundaries and reduces misclassification. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness with small training datasets, achieving over 90% overall accuracy (OA) and 88.25% mean intersection over union (MIoU) when evaluating on test datasets. The DST-Transformer was further applied to large-scale winter wheat extraction across Shandong Province, China (an area 66 times larger than the training region) to evaluate its cross-regional transferability. Evaluation results showed OA over 92% and MIoU exceeding 85% at all validation sites, highlighting the DST-Transformer’s robustness and strong generalization capability. This study underscores the DST-Transformer’s potential for large-scale crop identification and illustrates the promise of Transformer-based architectures for efficient, high-precision crop mapping with small training datasets, advancing the application of deep learning in agricultural remote sensing."

 Frequent abnormal bareness events on Earth’s surfaces (ABEES) seriously threaten ecosystem stability and the safety of people’s lives and property, and it is urgent to carry out fine detection and timely warning. However, existing remote sensing indices for ABEES detection are only applicable to one or two types of ABEES and easily confuse different background information with ABEES, which makes it difficult to achieve fine detection of multiple types of ABEES in complex and unknown scenes. Therefore, this study proposed an index for the fine detection of multitype ABEES (ABEESI). Specifically, this study first conducted a comparative analysis of the shape and position differences in spectral curves between various ABEES and different ground objects. Then, representative bands that effectively capture these differences were selected to construct ABEESI. To evaluate the performance of the proposed index, six common types of ABEES and a large unknown scenario (Mongolia) were selected for testing. The validation results indicated that ABEESI achieves an F1-score exceeding 0.84 for detecting multiple types of ABEES, which is significantly better than traditional remote sensing indices, especially in cases of landslides, debris flows, and sand boils. Meanwhile, ABEESI still maintains good performance in a large unknown scenario, with a detection accuracy F1-score still exceeding 0.81. Overall, ABEESI is less affected by different background environments, effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional remote sensing indices that easily confuse ABEES with bright barren lands, artificial surfaces and other background environments. Moreover, ABEESI can effectively reflect different ABEES states, which makes it possible to provide an early warning in the early stages of ABEES and terminate warnings when the anomaly areas begin to recover."

 East Asia has historically experienced high atmospheric aerosol concentrations, particularly during winter, when aerosol optical depth (AOD) reaches its peak level and exhibits significant variability. This study investigated the long-term variability of wintertime AOD over East Asia, including statistical associations with emission trends from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), climate factors including the Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO), East Asian Jet Stream Index (EAJSI), Siberian High Index (SHI), and Arctic Sea Ice Index (ASI) in December–February from 2000 to 2022. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis revealed that although reductions in both NOₓ and SO2 emissions have significantly contributed to a long-term decrease in AOD, the pronounced intra-seasonal and interannual variability suggests additional influences from climate factors. The most prominent EOF mode of AOD variability was observed in February, along with strong associations with the SHI, EAWMI, and EAJSI. Climate indices related to the EAWMI exerted a stronger influence in late winter (February), partly due to intensified mid-latitude westerlies during the mature phase of the EAWMI. In contrast, the WPO primarily influenced early-winter AOD variability (December–January) by altering upper-level pressure patterns over the western Pacific, enhancing the EAJSI and modulating AOD distribution across the China–Korea region—a pattern that has become more evident in recent years. Furthermore, the rapid decline in Arctic Sea ice during early winter appeared to strengthen both the SHI and the EAJSI, leading to a decrease in AOD by late winter. These findings highlight the increasing importance of climate factors in influencing wintertime AOD over East Asia."

 By pinpointing the temporal and spatial key zone where hail precipitation instantaneously responds to cloud condensation nuclei concentration (CCNC) explosions, this study offers significant advancements in understanding CCNC-cloud-hail interactions and the potential for artificial hail suppression. An idealized hailstorm was simulated using high-resolving (500 m) across a comprehensive ensemble comprising 151 runs. This simulation incorporated five distinct time points from convective initiation to hail formation. It encompassed six vertical zones of initial CCNC. Five categories of CCNC explosions between 700 cm−3 and 70,000 cm−3 were considered. The results indicate that the value of the minimum hail precipitation rate is from below 10 % to 45 % of control member with convection development. At the initial time point, hail precipitation rate exhibits a non-monotonic response to CCN concentration, first decreases and then increases. Raindrops' formation (10 and 15 min) shifts the inflexion point. Hail formation (20 min) causes the response to first increase and then decrease. The small cloud droplets from CCNC explosions impede raindrop formation (suppressing hail precipitation, dominant at low CCNC) and promote raindrop growth (enhancing hail precipitation, dominant at high CCNC). As convection develops, the key zone for the response of hail precipitation to CCNC explosions rises from the atmospheric boundary layer region to the 0 °C layer. This increase is due to changes in the critical region of microphysical processes at different time points. The CCNC explosion in the key zone causes smaller cloud droplets, rise rapidly to exceed the critical region, and inhibit its collection by hail particles."
