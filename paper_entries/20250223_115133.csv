This study investigated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in water, insects, and rice frogs (Fejervarya multistriata) throughout their entire lifecycle. The median total PFAS concentrations were 1.15–5.53, 65.6, 7.31, 7.33, and 2.24–31.6 ng/g dry weight in insect, egg, tadpole, juvenile frog, and adult frog samples, respectively. Concentrations of PFASs with protein–water distribution coefficients (log KPW) > 2 decreased from eggs to tadpoles and were constant from tadpoles to frogs. By contrast, concentrations of PFASs with log KPW < 2 reached apex concentrations in tadpoles and juvenile frogs. No growth dilution was observed for PFASs from juvenile to adult frogs. Stable isotope and fatty acid compositions in frog and insect samples indicated little change in diet sources during frog growth. The bioaccumulation factors of PFASs with log KPW < 3 were decreased in tadpoles and frogs, suggesting preferential accumulation of low-proteinphilic PFASs from water. The distinct bioaccumulation profiles of PFASs during rice frog development emphasize the need for ecological and toxicological studies conducted throughout the amphibian lifecycle."

Lee,Monsoon‐Frontal Interactions Drive Cyclone Biparjoy's Wake Recovery in the Arabian Sea,"Cyclone‐generated cold wakes enhance productivity and impact local air‐sea interaction, paths and intensities of subsequent storms in the region. However, in‐situ observations of recovery across such wakes are rare. A cold wake in the Arabian Sea was surveyed using multiple shipboard instruments approximately 10 days after the passage of Cyclone Biparjoy in 2023. The wake, nearly 30 km wide, had a stronger (weaker) buoyancy gradient at its eastern (western) edge and assumed a downfront (upfront) orientation relative to the southwesterly monsoon winds. This resulted in notable asymmetry in the vertical structure of temperature, salinity and velocity at the edges of the wake, indicating the importance of Ekman Buoyancy Fluxes and Mixed Layer Eddies. While the wake recovery following a cyclone is often attributed to one‐dimensional diurnal heating and cooling, these observations underscore the role of interactions between monsoon winds and underlying three‐dimensional submesoscale processes for a slow‐moving cyclone wake recovery."

We proposed the “Deformed Water Layer (DWL) model” based on physical mechanisms, which can precisely describe methane relative permeability and forecast the critical water saturation for forming water lock. Our results suggest a two‐stage transition in methane gas permeability with increasing water saturation within nano‐pores, governed by spatial deformation of water phase.

Here, the potential relationship between extreme pIOD and subsequent summer TIO basin‐wide warming is explored using observations and model outputs, revealing that this sequential co‐occurrence is significantly influenced by Pacific SST conditions. Extreme pIODs that coincide with El Niño tend to be followed by TIO basin‐wide warming, whereas those cooccurring with neutral or La Niña conditions are comparatively less likely to do so. This is because El Niño can trigger anomalous anticyclone over the southeastern TIO, thereby maintaining and reinforcing the extreme pIOD‐related warm SST anomalies over the southwestern TIO, which subsequently induces SST warming over the northern TIO in summer. Our findings highlight the important modulation role of Pacific SST conditions, with significant implications for regional climate predictions."

The stronger mid‐Pliocene AMOC is therefore a consequence of mid‐Pliocene orography and vegetation, where the closed Arctic gateways are responsible for approximately 80% of the AMOC strengthening.

Four years of data from the Van Allen Probes, measuring electron density, the CALorimetric Electron Telescope on the International Space Station, measuring MeV electron precipitation, and solar‐wind/magnetic indices from the OMNI dataset are utilized. Our investigation reveals that electron loss in PSD increases with disturbance intensity. However, about one‐third of dropouts occur during small geomagnetic disturbance periods, some involving precipitation, while approximately 40% of storms do not lead to dropouts. Superposed epoch analysis identifies solar‐wind density and dynamic pressure as the main dropout drivers, while precipitation becomes more likely with higher trapped electron flux and stronger substorms.

In coastal Victoria Land (VL), changes to snowfall can impact ice masses, landscapes, and coastal ecosystems. Coastal VL is characterized by strong gradients in snowfall rates between the polar desert of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and the high accumulation in northern VL. Extreme precipitation events significantly contribute to total precipitation, with the largest contribution in the Terra Nova Bay area. We present a comprehensive analysis of snowfall dynamics in this region, using a Lagrangian moisture source diagnostic to study moisture sources and Self‐Organizing Maps (SOM) to link these to different synoptic weather types. The moisture for snowfall in VL originates from the Southern Ocean, with more local sources in the Ross Sea embayment in summer when sea ice is reduced. We show a strong division in moisture sources between northern and southern VL, with the north receiving precipitation from moisture sources to the west and southern VL from the east. Precipitation in northern VL results from meridional transport of marine air from lower latitudes, while precipitation in southern VL is related to cyclonic disturbances in the Ross Sea that bring moisture from the east. Extreme precipitation in northern VL occurs during blocking highs that intensify meridional transport. Such intrusions of marine air, sometimes in the form of atmospheric rivers, do not impact the more isolated western Ross Ice Shelf and southern VL further in the Ross Sea embayment."

Accurately predicting these effects is crucial for effective conservation. High emission development scenario is commonly viewed as the most detrimental to biodiversity. However, recent researches suggest a more complex relationship between development paths and biodiversity outcomes. Our study addresses this by using an emergy‐based approach to estimate current provincial‐level biodiversity potential and project future species richness losses (amphibians, mammals, and birds) across climate zones and provincial divisions under various SSP‐RCP scenarios for 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2090. The results revealed significant regional variations in China's biodiversity potential, with the highest in southwestern provinces. Future land use trends indicate increased construction land and barren alongside a decline in grasslands, leading to considerable habitat loss and fragmentation under various scenarios, stressing conservation needs. Future biodiversity loss follows the Hu line and climate zones, with significant decreases in the south and humid regions. Land‐use changes could reduce species richness by 1–6 per 10 km grid cell. High‐emission scenario SSP585 do not necessarily have the most detrimental effects on biodiversity and different scenarios require targeted focus on specific climatic zones and provinces. These findings underscore that different scenarios require targeted conservation efforts in specific regions sensitive to biodiversity loss. Our study provides a scientific foundation for these targeted efforts, ensuring that regions are prioritized under various future scenarios. This approach aids in developing effective conservation strategies amidst the complex interplay of land use dynamics and climate change."

 Developing a low-temperature and cost-effective manufacturing process for energy-efficient and high-performance oxide-thin-film transistors (TFTs) is a crucial step toward advancing next-generation device applications such as wearable and flexible electronics. Among several methods, a liquid-metal printing technique is considered a promising, cost-effective oxide semiconductor process due to its inherent advantages, such as vacuum-free, low-thermal budget, high throughput, and scalability. In this study, we have developed a pressure-assisted liquid-metal printing technique enabling the low-temperature synthesis of polycrystalline wide bandgap n-channel oxide-TFTs. The n-channel oxide TFTs based on ~3 nm-thick β-Ga2O3 channels exhibited good TFT switching properties with a threshold voltage of ~3.8 V, a saturation mobility of ~11.7 cm2 V−1 s−1, an on/off-current ratio of ~109, and a subthreshold slope of ~163 mV/decade. We also observed p-channel operation in the off-stoichiometric GaOx channels fabricated at high-pressure conditions. Toward oxide-based circuit applications, we developed high-performance oxide-TFT-based inverters.

 Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a groundbreaking therapeutic technology for selectively degrading proteins of interest (POIs). The structural variations in PROTACs unpredictably influence their protein degradation efficiency, which is predominantly assessed by quantifying POIs abundance through western blotting. This approach, however, falls short of enabling non-invasive monitoring of protein degradation within living cells let alone assessing directly the degradation effects in vivo.

Here, the authors show through a range of mutant libraries of HA and PB1 segments that Influenza NS2 regulates the replication of viral segments via conserved regions outside the U12 and U13 promoters. 
 Influenza A virus encodes conserved promoter sequences. Using minimal replication assays—transfections with viral polymerase, nucleoprotein, and a genomic template—these sequences were identified as 13nt at the 5’ end of the genomic RNA (U13) and 12nt at the 3’ end (U12). Other than the fourth 3’ nucleotide, the U12 and U13 sequences are identical between all eight RNA molecules of the segmented influenza A genome. However, individual segments can exhibit different dynamics during infection. Influenza NS2, which modulates transcription and replication differentially between genomic segments, may provide an explanation. Here, we assess how internal sequences of two genomic segments, HA and PB1, contribute to NS2-dependent replication and map such interactions down to individual nucleotides in PB1. We find that the expression of NS2 significantly alters sequence requirements for efficient replication beyond the identical U12 and U13 sequences, providing a potential mechanism for segment-specific replication dynamics across the influenza genome.

 Bacteria often carry multiple genes encoding anti-phage defense systems, clustered in defense islands and phage satellites. Various unrelated anti-phage defense systems target phage-encoded homologous recombinases (HRs) through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that the phage satellite SaPI2, which does not encode orthodox anti-phage defense systems, provides antiviral immunity mediated by Stl2, the SaPI2-encoded transcriptional repressor. Stl2 targets and inhibits phage-encoded HRs, including Sak and Sak4, two HRs from the Rad52-like and Rad51-like superfamilies. Remarkably, apo Stl2 forms a collar of dimers oligomerizing as closed rings and as filaments, mimicking the quaternary structure of its targets. Stl2 decorates both Sak rings and Sak4 filaments. The oligomerization of Stl2 as a collar of dimers is necessary for its inhibitory activity both in vitro and in vivo. Our results shed light on the mechanisms underlying antiviral immunity against phages carrying divergent HRs.

Here, the authors report a bubble shielding strategy to suppress H2O2 degradation by reverse engineering the gas-water-electrode interface, thus enabling high concentrations of H2O2 in membrane-free electrolyzer. 
 Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can be sustainably synthesized through the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction in a dual-chamber water electrolyzer separated by expensive ion exchange (IX) membranes. The development of an IX membrane-free electrolyzer has been limited by direct anodic degradation of the produced H2O2. Here, we devise a bubble shielding strategy by using a low-cost polytetrafluoroethylene hydrophobic porous layer (HPL) on the anode that enables numerous sites for anodically generated oxygen bubbles and significantly suppresses H2O2 degradation in the electrolyte. The H2O2 production increases by ~600% compared to that using non-bubble shielded anode. A high H2O2 concentration of 10.05 ± 0.05 g L−1 at 40 mA cm−2 can be obtained with both HPL-coated anode and cathode. A solar-driven disinfection device equipped with HPL-coated electrodes achieves >99.9% E. coli inactivation within 60 min.

 A zonally asymmetric surface temperature trend has been observed in the boreal winter over the Northern Hemisphere continents from the late 1980s to the late 2000s. While the cooling trend was pronounced over central Eurasia, the warming trend was evident over Northeastern North America and Greenland. However, such trends were suddenly reversed in the late 2000s. The surface energy budget reveals that the downward longwave radiation due to the Arctic Oscillation (AO)-related temperature and moisture advection was mostly responsible for such trends. While the sensible heat flux also contributed to the temperature trend over central Eurasia, other terms play a minor role. This result suggests that a zonally asymmetric temperature trend in boreal winter and its recent reversal in the Northern Hemisphere continents are largely driven by the internal climate variability, particularly the AO-related thermodynamic and dynamic processes."

 Brazilian Cerrado has the largest annual burned area (BA) in South America, with strong interannual variability. However, there is limited understanding of which climatic drivers lead to the interannual variability of Cerrado fires. This study found sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) are positively correlated with the Cerrado BA. Positive SSTAs over the NTA modulate the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) position, which suppresses atmospheric convection over the Cerrado region. While NTA SSTA peaks March, the precipitation reduction in Cerrado is pronounced during June–August, since the ITCZ shifts northward and the local monsoon weakens. This leads to moisture deficits for the following months, significantly enhancing fire activity in August–October. This result implies NTA can exert an independent influence on Cerrado in addition to the traditionally considered factor, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. This improves the predictability of fire activity because NTA precedes the fire season by 7 months."

Numerical modeling with a regional ocean modeling system (ROMS) reconstructed the ocean environment during these events. Semi-idealized experiments confirmed that typical TIME events arise from the energy transfer between kinetic and potential energy, with vertical diffusion and horizontal advection contributing significantly to COE spin-up. Divergence and vertical advection terms suppress excessive COE growth. Given the increasing intensity and slower movement of typhoons due to global warming, more TIMEs are expected in the future.

 The volume of the East Antarctica Ice Sheet is equivalent to ~52 m of sea-level rise, but whether the ice sheet is a major contributor to global sea-level increase remains debated. How an ice sheet responds to climate-induced perturbations strongly depends on the physical conditions below the ice-bed interface; therefore, constraining the solid Earth structure beneath East Antarctica is critical. However, sparse seismic station coverage has limited our ability to image key characteristics. Here we employ full-waveform ambient noise tomography, an approach that better resolves Earth structure in sparsely sampled areas compared to traditional techniques, and our results reveal previously unrecognized, low-velocity anomalies under the Wilkes and Aurora Subglacial Basins. Our findings suggest thinner-than-expected lithosphere and thermally perturbed upper mantle, implying drastically different geothermal heat flux and mantle viscosity inputs compared to those from prior tomographic studies.

 Plastic pollution in the world’s oceans threatens ecosystems and biodiversity. The connected nature of the marine environment suggests that coordinated actions by countries sharing an ocean border may provide more effective pollution control than unilateral actions by any one country. However, countries often fail to cooperate, even when joint economic benefits would be higher under cooperation. Here we present a modelling framework to determine the potential economic benefits of cooperative marine plastic pollution management. The framework integrates an estimated plastic transfer matrix from a particle tracking model with game theory to derive the economic benefits of international cooperation for 16 countries bordering the North Atlantic Ocean. Subject to modelling uncertainties, a fully cooperative agreement yields aggregate annual net benefits of around $36 billion and a 64% reduction in emissions. The net benefits of cooperation persist over alternative scenarios and considering the impact of uncertainties but vary in magnitude and distribution.

 Earthquake multiplets are an important but poorly understood class of seismic sequence. On October 7th–15th 2023, a multiplet comprising five damaging, moment magnitude (Mw) 5.9–6.4 earthquakes struck northwestern Afghanistan, a region previously lacking in well-recorded seismicity. We mapped ground deformation with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and characterized the causative faulting using elastic dislocation modelling. Because of the tight clustering in time, only the fifth mainshock is ever imaged on its own, so we apply independent seismological constraints from epicentral relocations and moment tensor inversions to distinguish the contribution of each mainshock to the observed surface deformation. Our results support sequential rupture of five colinear, shallow (~5 km), north-dipping, blind reverse faults, with successive mainshocks stepping initially westwards and subsequently eastwards. Our modelling implies that gentle (10–15o) fault bends and/or step-overs may have halted rupture propagation in individual mainshock, acting to divide the sequence into its five distinct events. The epicentral region shows abundant geomorphic evidence for active shortening, including a ~70 km-long anticlinal ridge whose growth is likely driven by the underlying reverse faults. This sequence confirms that while to a first degree northwestern Afghanistan is part of stable Eurasia, slow internal deformation can nevertheless generate damaging earthquakes.

 Volcanic supereruptions are considered among the few drivers of global and existential catastrophes, with recent hypotheses suggesting massive volcanic stratospheric sulfate injection could instigate major shifts in global climate. The absence of supereruptions during recent history as well as large uncertainties on eruption ages limits understanding of the climatic risk they impose. Polar ice cores have well-resolved continuous age models, record past temperature, and contain volcanic sulfate and cryptotephra deposits which can be geochemically fingerprinted to determine eruption timing and improve stratospheric sulfur loading estimates. Here, we provide an age of 79,500 years for the Atitlán Los Chocoyos supereruption, one of the largest Quaternary eruptions, by identifying tephra shards in ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica. This ice core age is supported by a revised marine sediment core stratigraphy age for the Los Chocoyos ash layer. Through comparison with well-dated ice-core temperature proxy records, our study suggests that despite being one of the largest sulfur emissions recorded in ice cores, the Los Chocoyos supereruption did not trigger a millennial-scale cold period.

 As climate change intensifies, the adverse impacts of extreme weather events on energy supply systems will increase. Here, we collected energy grid utility datasets to illustrate causes and recovery processes of extended power outages induced by typhoon events in Japan. We also assessed the performance of demand-side solutions to enhance home energy resilience using household load profiles. We show that power outages present similar recovery curves, with full restoration times highly dependent on maximum wind velocities and affected regions. Ensuring a 24-hour self-energy supply is essential to mitigate outage impacts. Further, our results highlight the importance of off-grid energy storage or production in sustaining critical household energy loads under extended outage conditions.

 The Agulhas leakage is expected to increase as the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds change under climate warming. An increased Agulhas leakage could potentially strengthen the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). To date, however, it remains elusive how much this process could affect the AMOC, which is projected to weaken in the future. Here we carry out a suite of ocean-only simulations, which represent the present climate, and show that an arbitrary 10 Sv increase in the Agulhas leakage strengthens the AMOC by less than 1.3 Sv, which will unlikely substantially offset the projected AMOC weakening. The weak AMOC intensification arises due to compensation between subsurface warming and salinification. However, the AMOC responses to Agulhas leakage increases may depend on the climate background state. Initialized from a collapsed AMOC, which likely occurred during the glacial period, an increased Agulhas leakage can vigorously strengthen the AMOC due to a more unstable AMOC.

 Climate change has led to stronger warming in the Arctic, causing higher ground temperatures and extensive permafrost thaw. Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTSs) represent one of the most rapid and considerable geomorphological changes in permafrost regions, occurring when ice-rich permafrost is exposed and thaws. However, large-scale quantification of RTS-related mass wasting in Arctic permafrost landscapes is currently lacking, despite its importance to understand impacts on local environments and the global permafrost carbon cycle. Generating differential digital elevation models (dDEMs) from TanDEM-X single-pass Interferometric SAR (InSAR) observations enables us to quantify volume changes induced by rapid permafrost thaw. To extend this capability across the entire Arctic permafrost region, automation in data processing and RTS detection is essential. This study introduces a method that employs deep learning on InSAR-derived dDEMs to map RTSs and quantify volume changes from RTS activity. We chose eleven study sites with a total area of 71 400 km2 to reflect the diverse character of Arctic environments for model training, testing, and inference. Our trained UNet++ model delivers a scalable solution for mapping RTSs and quantifying mass wasting towards a pan-Arctic scale, achieving segmentation accuracies of 0.58 (Intersection over Union) and classification accuracies of 0.75 (F1) on previously unseen test sites, with volume change estimates from model predictions being within ± 20% of the actual values.

 Timely and accurate geolocalization of natural disasters is crucial for effective emergency response, which is foundational for risk mitigation and resilience development. Although social media texts have been widely used to recognize and resolve disaster geolocations, the implicit geoinformation in social media images remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-enhanced disaster geolocalization method that considers both explicit and implicit geoinformation from multimodal data. Based on the recognition of geolocations in disaster-related images and texts, geolocalization results were obtained by combining LLMs with map services. The selection of a geolocalization strategy depends on the available geoinformation modality and the presence of spatial relationships. A multimodal dataset of 1,000 images and 1,000 texts from the Hurricane Harvey Twitter dataset was constructed to evaluate geolocalization accuracy through error distance.

 Serious bumps caused by clear air turbulence (CAT) pose significant safety hazards during flight. CAT is also a mechanism of the stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE), influencing the mixing of trace gases in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The strong vertical wind shear in the upper level induced by the large topography and unique climatic conditions facilitate the formation of CAT over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This paper utilizes ERA5 reanalysis data from 1979 to 2019 to investigate the distribution characteristics of CAT over the TP. Additionally, the effects of tropopause folds on CAT were also discussed. Finally, we compare the rate of ozone change in the UTLS between cases with folds but no CAT and those with both folds and CAT, using CAMS ozone reanalysis data from 2003 to 2019. Results indicate that the occurrence frequency of CAT over the TP is significantly higher than in surrounding areas.

The distribution and intensity of CAT are correlated with the subtropical westerly jet stream, occurring both above and below the jet axis, showing stronger CAT observed beneath the axis. Additionally, tropopause folds significantly enhance the frequency and intensity of CAT, especially as the depth of the fold increases. CAT intensifies STE associated with folds, leading to a reduction in stratospheric ozone and a corresponding increase in tropospheric ozone."

 Atmospheric weighted mean temperature (Tm) is an important parameter in the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) meteorology, essential for retrieving precipitable water vapor (PWV). The FengYun-4 satellite (FY-4) carries Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), which realizes the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional detection of the vertical structure of the atmosphere in geostationary orbit, providing a more convenient and accurate data source for the inversion of Tm. The study presents a novel approach for deriving the Tm based on the GIIRS products of FengYun-4A satellite (FY-4A) and FengYun-4B satellite (FY-4B). The Tm calculated from the radiosonde data is utilized as reference to assess the performance of FY-4A and FY-4B, which demonstrates that the GIIRS equipped on FY-4 can provide a new way to obtain the Tm. The numerical results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are 1.65/ 2.06 K and 1.38/ 1.73 K for FY-4A and FY-4B, respectively. The different performance of FY-4A and FY-4B on Tm are also observed from the analysis of the geographical distribution, seasons and epochs. Specifically, the RMSE distribution of FY-4A at different stations ranges from 1.08 to 3.47 K, while the distribution of FY-4B is more concentrated between 1.37 and 2.70 K. The accuracy of FY-4 A deteriorates as increasing latitude, while the phenomenon is not obvious for FY-4B. Moreover, FY-4 A performs slightly better at UTC 0:00 than at UTC 12:00, while FY-4B has a slightly better performance in autumn than in other seasons."
