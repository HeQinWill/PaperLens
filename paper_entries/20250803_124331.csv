The UV/peroxymonosulfate (UV/PMS) process represents a promising disinfection strategy, as UV radiation, PMS, and radicals generated from PMS synergistically inactivate pathogens. In this study, we demonstrate that halide ions at seawater-level concentrations markedly enhance the inactivation efficiency of Aspergillus niger spores by the UV/PMS process. Under seawater conditions, the UV/PMS process (50-μM PMS and 84-mJ cm–2 UV fluence) achieved complete inactivation of 5.11-log Aspergillus niger spores, compared to only 2.45-log inactivation in deionized water under identical conditions. Through quenching experiments and kinetic modeling, we identify reactive halogen species (RHS, e.g., BrO•, Br2•–, BrCl•–) as the primary contributors to the enhanced inactivation of spores in seawater via the UV/PMS process. Microbial characterization further confirms that RHS compromise cellular integrity by causing disruption of membrane structures and damage to internal organelles. Additionally, RHS effectively suppress fungal spore photoreactivation, a critical mechanism for pathogen regrowth. These findings advance our understanding of RHS generation in saline environments and clarify their role in the mechanisms of fungal spore inactivation."

Differences in CP use patterns (indoors vs outdoors) and temporal release trends in different regions may be reflected in differences in the extent and pathways of long-term exposure to CPs between human populations. We used the dynamic mechanistic model PROTEX to simulate releases and environmental fates of CPs in China, Canada, and Europe from 1930 to 2020 and contrast the resultant exposures for different birth cohorts. Predicted environmental and human body concentrations agree with measurements from the three regions. Far-field exposure pathways dominate for all cohorts even in China where CP indoor use is high. Longitudinal exposure trends differ between generations and regions due to the divergent release trends. Perinatal exposure causes high body concentrations in infants and children born in years with peak releases. Due to human elimination half-lives that are short relative to the period of release, cross-sectional concentration-age trends have similar shapes regardless of release trend and sampling time. These results imply that whereas use patterns and release trends add to the influence of physicochemical properties on relative exposure pathway importance and cross-sectional concentration-age trends, the release trends are the main factors shaping longitudinal exposure trends."

However, the mechanisms of 6PPDQ toxicity are currently unresolved. While species-specific metabolomic effects of 6PPDQ exposure have been explored, to our knowledge no studies have investigated the in situ spatial distribution of 6PPDQ and 6PPDQ biotransformation products in salmonids. Herein, we employ nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to visualize 6PPDQ metabolism in 6-week posthatch rainbow trout fry exposed to 0.61 μg/L of 6PPDQ for 96 h. These data provide the first spatial mapping of 6PPDQ metabolism in fishes. 6PPDQ was not observed in any fish tissues; however, primary 6PPDQ biotransformation products, hydroxylated 6PPDQ and dihydroxylated 6PPDQ, were found to localize in the liver and gut of exposed fry. Additionally, interrogation of nontargeted nano-DESI spatial metabolomics revealed an accumulation of free fatty acids in the central nervous system of exposed fry. Overall, this study uncovers the spatially resolved 6PPDQ metabolism in exposed fishes and explores the disparate localization of endogenous metabolites disrupted by 6PPDQ exposure."

However, the anthropogenic forcing on soil erosion beyond instrumental records or historical documentation is largely unknown. Here we analyze markers for low‐intensity fires and soil erosion in East Java over the past 5,000 years. We find evidence of a substantial human impact on fire occurrence due to the onset/intensification of swidden cultivation around 3,500 years ago, in the absence of changes in regional hydroclimate or vegetation. Highest soil erosion occurred during the past 500 years, coinciding with a transition toward permanent agriculture. Human‐impacted soil erosion was further amplified by intense monsoonal rainfall and strong rainfall seasonality around 2,000 and 300 years ago. With such rainfall anomalies projected to occur with higher frequency and severity in the tropics under the ongoing greenhouse warming, our results suggest an accelerating erosion rate in the future, posing risks for natural resources."

Here, based on subaqueous experiments using a high‐speed camera, discrete numerical computations solving the motion at the grain scale, and a special training of a convolutional neural network, we show that it is, in fact, possible to estimate the resultant force acting on the grains of a barchan dune by using images. This procedure opens new possibilities for measuring the resultant force not only on the grains of a dune, but also on relatively small elements that are imaged over time, such as rocks, boulders, rovers, and human‐built constructions photographed by satellites on terrestrial and Martian landscapes."

Predominantly observed within 20 Saturn radii, the occurrence rates of L‐O mode SKR exhibit a preference below 20° in latitude, and a local time asymmetry with a higher occurrence rate on the dayside. Occurrence maps indicate that low‐frequency (<100 kHz) L‐O mode SKR may be obstructed by the Enceladus plasma torus due to the higher electron density, while high‐frequency (>100 kHz) emissions can pass through unhindered.

Friend,Deforestation Could Push Amazonia Close to a Tipping Point Under Future Climate Change,"We use a coupled land‐surface‐atmosphere single‐column model to examine the effects of deforestation and changed advective moisture flux (AMF) on the Amazonian system. We find that from current conditions, a reduction to 35% forest cover, or a ∼10% decrease in AMF (∼6% less precipitation), causes the system to transition from a wet climate with rainforest to a drier climate with savanna‐like vegetation. The system responds highly non‐linearly to the combined influences of the AMF and deforestation. Small changes in either forest cover or moisture advection are capable of causing the system to flip abruptly between stable forest, savanna, or shrubland states. Model behavior is strongly influenced by the feedback between the land surface and the atmosphere, with natural vegetation changes playing a major role. Our results suggest that continued deforestation is likely to trigger a transition to a savanna‐like state across Amazonia within this century under current climate projections."

While recent and projected changes in the storm track due to human emissions have been extensively studied, the storms' response to natural forcings in past centuries is largely unknown. Using climate model simulations of the pre‐industrial millennium, we find that natural forcings acted to intensify the summer storm track over multi‐centennial timescales, with minor impacts on the winter storm track. In contrast to the human‐induced larger warming of high latitudes relative to low latitudes, which has weakened the summer storm track, natural agents cooled high latitudes more, enhancing the meridional temperature gradient, which intensified the storm track. This study highlights the unprecedented impacts of human emissions relative to the last millennium's natural forcing agents and the importance of including natural forcings in model projections."

Specifically, when compared to radiosonde TPW, TPWDiff‐CB yields a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.98 and a root mean square error of 4.51 mm under all‐weather condtions. The model demonstrates exceptional performance, maintaining near‐identical accuracy under both cloudy and clear‐sky conditions.

Cullen,From Sea to Summit: Investigating the Explicit Role of SST Increase for Regional and High‐Altitude Climates in New Zealand,"The oceans around New Zealand are regional warming hotspots where sea surface temperature (SST) is rising much faster than the global average. This study uses a sensitivity experiment with a regional atmospheric model to investigate how ocean warming over the past decade (2010–2020) has influenced New Zealand's climate at different spatial scales, with particular attention to the highly sensitive alpine regions of the Southern Alps. The approach addresses the effects of an isolated SST increase, explicitly excluding broader systemic changes associated with global warming. Results suggest that rising SSTs have driven widespread thermodynamic responses, including increases in near‐surface air temperature and humidity, particularly in autumn and summer. These responses have most likely affected circulation dynamics—such as changes in wind fields and moisture transport—that have modified the mesoscale flow regime near the Southern Alps, reshaping precipitation patterns and reducing foehn effects in the eastern lowlands. The dynamic responses, however, remain subject to uncertainty. Crucially, the impacts of the SST increase extend into the alpine environment, where surface warming is amplified and snowfall is reduced. Consequently, high‐elevation climate regimes have shifted toward warmer and more humid conditions, contributing to greater rainfall dominance and potentially accelerated glacial melt. This study provides a process‐based understanding of the influence of SST changes on both regional and high‐altitude climate in New Zealand. The findings emphasize the potential for continued ocean warming to exacerbate high‐elevation climate shifts and glacier retreat, with substantial implications for regional hydrology, ecosystems, and human activities."

The simulations driven by external reanalysis data sets are assessed and compared with the global simulation through a rigorous global‐regional integrated modeling approach. Additional regional simulations with boundary data taken from the global simulation reveal the critical role of cross‐boundary flows in aligning regional model behaviors with global results. The study focuses on downscaling performance, global‐regional comparisons, and the impact of lateral boundary flow. The downscaling simulations using different reanalysis data sets produce overall comparable large‐scale circulation patterns and mean precipitation biases. Nudged lateral boundary conditions improve the circulation performance but result in mixed precipitation outcomes, including higher mean‐state biases and artificial rainfall around the Tibetan Plateau area. Some intrinsic model biases (e.g., diurnal cycle and excessive light rainfall frequency) are consistent across global and regional simulations. Using explicit convection can address these limitations. Intense rainfall events and topographic precipitation errors show high sensitivity to lateral boundary flow variations, underscoring the complexity of interactions between regional dynamics and boundary flows. Systematic topographic precipitation biases persist but varying lateral boundary flows can regulate the magnitude. The results underscore the uncertainties associated with kilometer‐scale downscaling simulations under strong lateral boundary flows particularly concerning small‐scale intense and/or topographic rainfall events."

This study refines the daily OMI‐HTAP SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ emissions from 134 point sources (mainly in the ME) for 2016 using inverse modeling, Ozone Mapping Profiling Suite (OMPS) SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ column loading observations, and the Lagrangian particle dispersion FLEXPART‐WRF model. This model used hourly meteorological data from the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF‐Chem) run with OMI‐HTAP SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ inventory with zeroed emissions from the point sources. This allowed the exclusion of the “background” SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ column loadings caused by the spatially distributed emissions from the OMPS observations. The WRF‐Chem's code for simulating SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ sinks (dry deposition, oxidation) was ported into the FLEXPART‐WRF. The annual mean RMSE computed for posterior column loadings relative to OMPS observations improved by ≈ ${\approx} $21%. The total posterior point emissions rate dropped by ≈ ${\approx} $18%. We found that this overestimation of prior emissions is inherent to data‐driven emission quantification methods (e.g., the Gaussian plume fitting method), which are not capable of removing “background” column loadings in areas with a high density of strong point sources. The proposed approach avoids this deficiency. For some countries, seasonal variations of inverted emission rates are observed. The enhanced OMI‐HTAP data set will be applied in air‐quality modeling over the ME."

In human DCs, MV130 induces a transcriptomic and metabolic reprogramming, and restores non-pathological immune responses to allergens in healthy and asthmatic donors. Additionally, the adoptive transfer of MV130-stimulated BMDCs was sufficient to reproduce the protective features of the vaccine administration in vivo.

 Voltage sensors are essential for electromechanical coupling in hERG K+ channels, critical to cardiac rhythm. These sensors respond to membrane potential changes by moving within the transmembrane electric field. Mutations in hERG voltage-sensing arginines, associated with Long-QT syndrome, alter channel gating, though underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using live-cell fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, transition metal FRET, an improved dual stop-codon-mediated strategy for noncanonical amino-acid incorporation, and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify intermediate voltage-sensor conformations induced by neutralizing key arginines in the charge transfer center. Phasor plot analysis of lifetime data reveals multiple voltage-dependent FRET states in these mutants, in contrast to the single high-FRET state observed in controls. These intermediate FRET states reflect distinct conformations of the voltage sensor, corresponding to predicted structures of voltage sensors in molecular dynamics simulations. This study provides insights into cardiac channelopathies, highlighting a structural mechanism that impairs voltage sensing in cardiac arrhythmias.

 Cortical activity results from the interplay between network-connected regions that integrate information and stimulus-driven processes originating from sensory motor networks responding to specific tasks. Separating the information due to each of these components has been challenging, and the relationship as measured by fMRI in each of these cases Rest (network) and Task (stimulus-driven) remains a significant open question in the study of large-scale brain dynamics. In this study, we develop a network ordinary differential equation (ODE) model using advanced system identification tools to analyze fMRI data from both rest and task conditions. We demonstrate that task-specific ODEs are essentially a subset of rest-specific ODEs across four different tasks from the Human Connectome Project. By assuming that task activity is a relative complement of rest activity, our model significantly improves predictions of reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis, leading to a 9% increase in explanatory power (R2) across the 14 sub-tasks tested. We have additionally shown that these results hold for predicting missing trials and accuracy on a per individual basis as well as classifying Tasks trajectories or resulting dynamic Task functional connectivity. Our findings establish the principle of the Active Cortex Model, which posits that the cortex is always active and that Rest State encompasses all processes, while certain subsets of processes get elevated to perform specific task computations. Thus, this study is an important milestone in the development of the fMRI equation - to causally link large-scale brain activity, brain structural connectivity, and behavioral variables within a single framework.

 Lightweight, high-performance electromagnetic shielding materials rely on the precise design of electromagnetic response structures. Conventional shielding materials often involve complex fabrication of conjugated composites or graphitization of organic materials, facing challenges in balancing their performance and processability. As such, seeking and designing intrinsically conjugated materials with superior processability is crucial. In this work, we have innovatively engineered those bioinspired polymers with highly ordered microstructures, using a 5, 6-dihydroxyindole ring tetramer framework to construct highly ordered melanin-like nanofibers by tuning π–π stacking.

 Agricultural ecosystems are continuously exposed to exogenous phages, including those introduced via animal manure fertilization, yet their colonization dynamics and ecological impacts remain unclear. Using a microcosm experiment, we investigated how pig manure-derived nanosized microbiome (NSM; <0.22 μm) influences phage-bacterial interactions, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) dissemination, and microbial evolution in paddy soil. NSM addition transiently elevated high-risk ARG abundance, particularly linked to Acinetobacter proliferation from manure. These dynamics were driven by manure-derived Acinetobacter and their associated phages/plasmids, which dominated soil phage communities despite their low initial abundance. Both Acinetobacter and their phages exhibited microdiversity shifts under environmental fluctuations, with strong native soil phage-bacterial correlations disrupted post-NSM introduction. Our findings highlight the environmental risks of pig manure-derived NSM, emphasizing Acinetobacter and their phages as key drivers of high-risk ARG spread and microbial community evolution.

 Predicting the migration of marine life due to climate change is important not only ecologically but also for the management of valuable living marine resources. Anticipating how the habitable area of species will change on decision-relevant time scales, however, remains a challenge. Here we assess the predictability of a normalized metabolic index that expresses habitat-relevant anomalies in metabolic constraints using a coupled physical-biogeochemical prediction system based on an Earth system model. The normalized metabolic index was generally more predictable than temperature, especially in the subsurface tropics where persistent lateral oxygen advection anomalies at the boundary of oxygen minimum zones extended the predictability horizons. Further investigations suggest that interannual catch variations of bigeye tuna in the tropical exclusive economic zones can be anticipated from the predicted metabolic constraints a year in advance, supporting the potential utility of Earth system model-based physiological prediction for the proactive climate-informed management of living marine resources.

 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has emerged as an important data source for monitoring forest resources. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and Mobile laser scanning (MLS) have already shown high potential in further advancing forest inventory development. By enabling the retrieval of new forest attributes in addition to traditional ones, these technologies could drive forest inventories into a new paradigm by introducing innovative approaches to measuring and monitoring forests. The debate on the possible implementation of TLS and MLS in forest inventories, particularly in national forest inventories (NFIs), continues in both the scientific community and the public institutions. To date, few studies have evaluated the application of TLS and MLS technologies in large-scale forest inventories or assessed their practical operational limits. In this practice-oriented paper, we first detail TLS and MLS data acquisition and processing for tree attribute estimation, assessing their maturity and main limitations. We then explore three European case studies—from the French, Finnish, and Swiss National Forest Inventories (NFIs)—where these technologies have been tested. Based on these experiences, we identify the main constraints and challenges for operational implementation. Lastly, we discuss the prospects for TLS and MLS within the NFI context and the requirements for their successful adoption. We conclude that TLS and MLS should be viewed not as a replacement for, but as a complement to and enhancement of, traditional NFI practices.

 The informatization of complex city operations and management is a key trend, and the digital twin (DT) is an effective way of achieving this. However, existing methods for constructing city twin scenes are highly complex and inefficient, making it difficult to meet the efficient construction of digital twin scenes for complex cities. To address this problem, this paper proposes a geographic knowledge graph (GeoKG)-guided twin modeling method for complex city scenes. First, the characteristics and relationships of city scene modeling objects were explored, and a dynamic data-driven algorithm was designed for constructing a GeoKG. Next, the spatial, attribute, and scale relationships within city models were analyzed. From the perspectives of object, attribute, and scene modeling, a multi-level dynamic fusion mechanism was constructed, leading to the proposal of a dynamic fusion modeling method of complex city scene guided by GeoKG. Based on this method, a prototype system was developed for an urban park, and experimental analysis was conducted. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can achieve complex city scene twin modeling, with average fusion modeling times of 1.2, 1.8, 3.0, and 4.1 s for desktop, PC, tablet, and mobile platforms, respectively. The dynamic rendering efficiency remained above 85, 65, 54, and 38 FPS for these platforms, respectively.

 Using various observations and the linear baroclinic model (LBM), this study investigates the impact of out-of-phase variations in the Arctic Oscillation (AO) between March and April on the zonal shift of the South Asian High (SAH) in July. The results indicate that a negative AO in March followed by a positive AO in April can lead to an eastward shift of the SAH in July, and vice versa. This out-of-phase AO variation accounts for approximately 23 % of the interannual variation in the zonal shift of the SAH in July. Further analysis reveals that a negative AO in March induces positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the high-latitude North Atlantic by modulating surface heat fluxes and zonal SST advection. In April, the atmospheric circulation associated with the positive AO causes positive SST anomalies to develop to the west of Europe. Due to the ocean memory effect, these positive SST anomalies persist into July, leading to positive geopotential height anomalies in the troposphere and lower stratosphere over Northern Europe in July through eddy-mediated processes. The vorticity anomalies associated with the geopotential height anomalies trigger Rossby wave trains over Eurasia, characterized by negative geopotential height anomalies over the northwestern SAH and positive geopotential height anomalies over the eastern SAH, ultimately resulting in an eastward shift of the SAH."

 Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) play a pivotal role in cloud formation and precipitation, yet predicting their concentrations remains difficult due to limited understanding of their spatiotemporal variability and characteristics. Therefore, it is important to provide insights into how aerosol properties and meteorological parameters are related to INP concentrations. This study investigated INP concentrations, their heat sensitivity, particle chemical components, and meteorological parameters at urban (Yokohama) and rural (Noto) sites in Japan during Dust and Non-Dust periods. While no single key factor consistently explained INP concentrations, relatively strong associations were observed with factors implying particles such as mineral dust, heat-sensitive biological particles, and Pb-containing particles from coal and waste combustion, with variations depending on site and season. During the Dust period, INP concentrations at both sites were correlated with the mineral indicators (R > 0.57), though INPs above −15 °C remained low at Noto site (R = 0.49). In the Non-Dust period, mineral indicators cannot account for INP levels at either site (R < −0.31). Heat treatment-induced deactivation of INPs above −15 °C in the urban area suggested a close association between biological INPs and mineral particles. Although submicron INPs account for only a small fraction of total INPs at the surface (e.g., < 6.5 % at −12.5 °C), the particle types that contributed to the variability in INP concentrations were nevertheless supported previous qualitative findings. Our findings also highlight the complexity of quantitatively linking environmental factors that vary by region and time to INP concentration variations to characterize aerosol–cloud interactions."

 Chinese high-density visibility observation stations provide more uniform coverage than traditional air quality monitors, spanning urban, rural, and remote areas, which improves spatial representativeness. The visibility data from these stations has the potential to optimize aerosol initial conditions in air quality models, thereby improving the accuracy of pollution forecasting. This study details the development of a visibility observation assimilation module integrated with the WRF-Chem model. We aim to assimilate visibility data and evaluate the improvement in model performance achieved through assimilation compared to a direct WRF-Chem simulation. The assimilation system utilizes an advanced multi-scale three-dimensional variational assimilation (MS-3DVAR) technique and employs WRF-Chem MOSAIC aerosol species concentrations as control variables. To extensively evaluate the developed visibility assimilation algorithm, we conducted three numerical experiments focused on the forecasting accuracy of dust events that occurred in Northern China in March 2021. The first experiment (DA_PM&AOD) assimilated particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. The second experiment (DA_EXT) assimilated visibility data, while the third experiment (DA_ALL) integrated particulate matter, AOD, and visibility data. The evaluation demonstrates that, the control experiment group consistently underestimated the values during dust events. The DA_EXT assimilation group significantly improved the forecast accuracy of PM10 concentration and EXT (extinction coefficient). In the DA_PM&AOD experiment, the agreement index between PM10 simulation and observation increased to above 0.9. In the DA_ALL experiment, the agreement index for EXT simulation reached 0.677. The evaluation reveals that assimilating visibility data significantly improves both the initial aerosol fields and dust process forecasting in the model.
