10.5194/acp-24-13129-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了德里特大城市在季风季节（清洁空气）和季风后季节（严重污染）期间，挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）对大气化学的影响。研究人员使用质谱法对111种气体进行了定量分析，发现污染季节的总质量浓度是清洁季节的四倍以上，这主要归因于生物质燃烧排放的增加和大气通风的减少。研究中还发现了此前未在德里这种污染环境中报道的含氮、氯和硫的活性气体化合物。研究结果揭示了德里大气中VOCs的种类、丰度、变化性和排放特征，这对于理解像德里这样高度污染的城市大气环境具有重要意义。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它直接测量了大气成分，并分析了其季节变化，这与空气质量监测和大气成分分析直接相关。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'volatile organic compounds (VOCs)', 'mass spectrometry', 'megacity air pollution', 'Delhi', 'seasonal variation']",Sachin Mishra;Vinayak Sinha;Haseeb Hakkim;Arpit Awasthi;Sachin D.

Rajeevan,"Reactive chlorine-, sulfur-, and nitrogen-containing volatile organic compounds impact atmospheric chemistry in the megacity of Delhi during both clean and extremely polluted seasons","We quantified 111 gases using mass spectrometry to understand how seasonal and emission changes lead from clean air in the monsoon season to extremely polluted air in the post-monsoon season in Delhi. Averaged total mass concentrations (260 µg m-3) were > 4 times in polluted periods, driven by biomass burning emissions and reduced atmospheric ventilation. Reactive gaseous nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur compounds hitherto unreported from such a polluted environment were discovered. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly impact the atmospheric chemistry of polluted megacities. Delhi is a dynamically changing megacity, and yet our knowledge of its ambient VOC composition and chemistry is limited to few studies conducted mainly in winter before 2020 (all pre-COVID-19). Here, using a new extended volatility range high-mass-resolution (10 000–15 000) proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer, we measured and analysed ambient VOC mass spectra acquired continuously over a 4-month period, covering “clean” monsoon (July–September) and “polluted” post-monsoon seasons, for the year 2022. Out of 1126 peaks, 111 VOC species were identified unambiguously. Averaged total mass concentrations reached ∼ 260 µg m−3 and were > 4 times in the polluted season relative to the cleaner season, as driven by enhanced emissions from biomass burning and reduced atmospheric ventilation (∼ 2). Among 111, 56 were oxygenated, 10 contained nitrogen, 2 chlorine, 1 sulfur, and 42 were pure hydrocarbons. VOC levels during polluted periods were significantly higher than most developed world megacities. Methanethiol, dichlorobenzenes, C6 amides, and C9 organic acids/esters, which have previously never been reported in India, were detected in both the clean and polluted periods. The sources were industrial for methanethiol and dichlorobenzenes, purely photochemical for the C6 amides, and multiphase oxidation and partitioning for C9 organic acids. Aromatic VOC / CO emission ratio analyses indicated additional biomass combustion/industrial sources in the post-monsoon season, along with year-round traffic sources in both seasons. Overall, the unprecedented new information concerning ambient VOC speciation, abundance, variability, and emission characteristics during contrasting seasons significantly advances current atmospheric composition understanding of highly polluted urban atmospheric environments like Delhi."
10.5194/acp-24-13115-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了人为排放的铁气溶胶粒径分布对海洋可溶性铁输入的影响。研究表明，铁气溶胶的排放粒径大小是调控可溶性铁输送到开阔大洋的关键因素，不同的粒径分布会导致模拟结果相差达10倍。较细的铁气溶胶粒径（<1 µm）能延长其在大气中的寿命，促进大气中的转化过程，从而增加可溶性铁向海洋的沉降量。该研究强调了铁排放粒径分布与排放通量在调控可溶性铁沉降方面同样重要，尤其对偏远海域。这对于改进大气铁沉降估算模型，量化大气营养物质输入对海洋生物地球化学的影响具有重要意义。研究中使用了全球气溶胶模拟，并与全球飞行测量数据集进行了对比验证。虽然文章没有直接提及具体的卫星或传感器，但其研究结果对利用卫星观测数据进行大气铁浓度反演和海洋初级生产力估算具有重要参考价值。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Aerosol size distribution', 'Iron', 'Satellite observations', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Marine biogeochemistry', 'Primary production']",Mingxu Liu;Hitoshi Matsui;Douglas S. Hamilton;Sagar D. Rathod;Kara D. Lamb;Natalie M. Mahowald,Representation of iron aerosol size distributions of anthropogenic emissions is critical in evaluating atmospheric soluble iron input to the ocean,"Atmospheric aerosol deposition provides bioavailable iron to promote marine primary production, yet the estimates of its fluxes remain highly uncertain. This study, by performing global aerosol simulations, demonstrates that iron-containing particle size upon emission is a critical factor in regulating soluble iron input to open oceans. Further observational constraints on this are needed to reduce modeling uncertainties. 
 Atmospheric aerosol deposition acts as a major source of soluble (bioavailable) iron in open ocean regions where it limits phytoplankton growth and primary production. The aerosol size distribution of emitted iron particles, along with particle growth from mixing with other atmospheric components, is an important modulator of its long-range transport potential. There currently exists a large uncertainty in the particle size distribution of iron aerosol, and the extent to which such uncertainty shapes global soluble iron deposition remains unclear. Here, we couple a sophisticated microphysical, size-resolved aerosol model with an iron-speciated and iron-processing module to disentangle the impact of iron emission size distributions on soluble iron input to the ocean, with a focus on anthropogenic combustion and metal smelting sources. We evaluate our model results against a global-scale flight measurement dataset for anthropogenic iron concentration and show that the different representations of iron size distribution upon emission, as adopted in previous studies, introduce a variability in modeled iron concentrations over remote oceans of a factor of 10. Shifting the iron aerosol size distribution toward finer particle sizes (< 1 µm) enables a longer atmospheric lifetime (a doubling), promoting atmospheric processing, which enhances the soluble iron deposition to ocean basins by up to 50 % on an annual basis. The monthly enhancements reach 110 % and 80 % over the Southern Ocean and North Pacific Ocean, respectively. Uniquely, our results highlight that compared with emission flux variability, iron emission size distribution plays an equally important role in regulating soluble iron deposition, especially to the remote oceans. Our new findings can help to interpret inter-model differences in iron deposition estimation and to better quantify the effects of atmospheric nutrient input on marine biogeochemistry, including but not limited to iron and phosphorus."

Nagao;Haruma Ishida,Description and validation of the Japanese algorithm for radiative flux and heating rate products with all four EarthCARE instruments: pre-launch test with A-Train,"A Japanese team developed the Level 2 atmospheric radiation flux and heating rate product for EarthCARE, which offers vertical profiles of longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes and heating rates. This study outlines the algorithm for the radiative product and its comparative validation against satellite and ground-based observations. It also analyzes errors in radiative fluxes at various scales and their dependence on cloud type, with ice-containing clouds identified as a primary error source. 
 This study developed an algorithm for the Level 2 (L2) atmospheric radiation flux and heating rate product by a Japanese team for Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE). This product offers vertical profiles of downward and upward longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) radiative fluxes and their atmospheric heating rates. This paper describes the algorithm developed for generating products, including the atmospheric radiative transfer model and input datasets, and its validation against measurement data of radiative fluxes. In the testing phase before the EarthCARE launch, we utilized A-Train data that provided input and output variables analogous to EarthCARE, so that the developed algorithm could be directly applied to EarthCARE after its launch. The results include comparisons of radiative fluxes between radiative transfer simulations and satellite and ground-based observations that quantify errors in computed radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere against Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) observations and their dependence on cloud type with varying thermodynamic phases. For SW fluxes, the bias was 24.4 W m−2, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 36.3 W m−2 relative to the CERES observations at spatial and temporal scales of 5° and 1 month, respectively. On the other hand, LW exhibits a bias of −10.7 W m−2 and an RMSE of 14.2 W m−2. When considering different cloud phases, the SW water cloud exhibited a bias of −11.7 W m−2 and an RMSE of 46.2 W m−2, while the LW showed a bias of 0.8 W m−2 and an RMSE of 6.0 W m−2. When ice clouds were included, the SW bias ranged from 58.7 to 81.5 W m−2 and the RMSE from 72.8 to 91.6 W m−2 depending on the ice-containing cloud types, while the corresponding LW bias ranged from −8.8 to −28.4 W m−2 and the RMSE from 25.9 to 31.8 W m−2, indicating that the primary source of error was ice-containing clouds. The comparisons were further extended to various spatiotemporal scales to investigate the scale dependency of the flux errors. The SW component of this product exhibited an RMSE of approximately 30 W m−2 at spatial and temporal scales of 40° and 40 d, respectively, whereas the LW component did not show a significant decrease in RMSE with increasing spatiotemporal scale. Radiative transfer simulations were also compared with ground-based observations of the surface downward SW and LW radiative fluxes at selected locations. The results show that the bias and RMSE for SW are −17.6 and 172.0 W m−2, respectively, which are larger than those for LW that are −5.6 and 19.0 W m−2, respectively."
10.5194/amt-2024-187,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques Discussions,这篇论文研究了一种低成本光学粒子计数器(OPC-N3)用于估算土壤风蚀过程中颗粒物排放通量的能力。研究者将OPC-N3与传统的OPC进行了对比，利用涡动协方差法估算了颗粒物通量。结果表明，OPC-N3能够以较高的精度(误差小于30%)估算颗粒物通量，显示出其在风蚀研究中的应用潜力。该研究属于大气环境地面观测范畴，关注的是大气中颗粒物(特别是沙尘)的浓度和通量，与空气质量监测和环境遥感密切相关。虽然没有直接使用卫星观测数据，但该研究为改进沙尘气溶胶的估算方法提供了技术支持，有助于提高沙尘暴预报和空气质量预报的精度。,"['Particulate matter', 'Dust emission', 'Eddy covariance', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Optical particle counter', 'Ground-based observation']",Sylvain Dupont;Eric Lamaud;Mark R.

They are more affordable, compact, and use less power than traditional OPCs. We tested the ability of the low-cost OPC-N3 from Alfasense to estimate the dust emission flux during erosion events in Jordan.

 The recent development of low-cost optical particle counters (OPCs) presents new opportunities for improving spatial coverage of particle concentration in the atmosphere as they are more affordable, compact, and consume less power than traditional OPCs. In particular, these OPCs could improve our ability to quantify dust emissions in complex environments during aeolian soil erosion. The high frequency sampling capacity (1 Hz) of some sensors may make them suitable for estimating dust emissions using the eddy-covariance method. Here, the capability of the low-cost OPC-N3 from Alfasense to estimate the size-resolved dust flux using the eddy-covariance method is evaluated. During the Jordan Wind Erosion and Dust Investigation (J-WADI) experiment, we tested one OPC-N3 against traditional reference OPCs. The OPCs were located in close proximity to a sonic anemometer, enabling the correlation of dust concentration and vertical velocity fluctuations for estimating dust fluxes. Despite the high temperature and dusty wind conditions of the campaign, the N3 monitored the dynamics and magnitude of dust concentration with reasonable precision. The turbulence characteristics of the dust concentration fluctuations measured by the N3 were similar to those from the reference OPC. After calibrating the N3 dust concentration, the N3 accurately estimated the dust emission flux, with differences of less than 30 % compared to the reference OPC. Our results confirm the potential of low-cost OPCs for dust-erosion research. Nonetheless, further evaluation of low-cost OPCs is still needed across different environments and weather conditions."
10.5194/amt-2024-177,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques Discussions,这篇论文评估了利用卫星数据反演云滴浓度的方法的准确性。研究者使用了中等分辨率成像光谱仪（MODIS）的卫星数据，并将其与三次飞行任务中获取的飞机原位测量数据进行了比较。结果表明，MODIS反演的云滴浓度与飞机测量值存在高达±50%或更大的差异，并且MODIS反演结果存在高估的偏差。研究还发现，MODIS反演的云滴浓度值更能代表云层的中部区域，云顶和云底的差异更大。此外，研究还分析了不同情况下反演结果与实测结果差异的原因，指出差异可能源于有效半径、消光系数和液态水含量的差异。总的来说，该研究关注的是利用卫星遥感技术反演大气云层微物理特性，特别是云滴浓度，这属于大气环境遥感技术的研究范畴。,"['cloud droplet number concentration', 'MODIS', 'satellite remote sensing', 'aircraft measurements', 'marine stratocumulus clouds', 'atmospheric composition', 'cloud properties']",Scarlet R. Passer;Mikael K. Witte;Patrick Y. Chuang,Aircraft Evaluation of MODIS Cloud Drop Number Concentration Retrievals,"One important property of a cloud is the concentration of cloud drops. This property is relevant to how the cloud interacts with sunlight, and how easily the cloud forms precipitation. Measuring this property from satellite is one important source of data, but it does require making some assumptions. This study evaluates the accuracy of satellite-derived drop concentration by comparing to aircraft measurements. 
 Cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) can be retrieved through passive satellite observation. These retrievals are useful due to their wide spatial and temporal coverage. However, the accuracy of the retrieved values is not well understood. In this paper, we compare satellite Nd derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument with in situ aircraft measurements using a phase Doppler interferometer onboard three flight campaigns sampling marine stratocumulus clouds. Intercomparison of Nd values shows that the discrepancy between retrieved and in situ Nd can be ±50 % or more. In the mean, there is evidence of an overestimation bias by MODIS retrievals, although the sample size is insufficient for statistical certainty. We find that MODIS Nd is best interpreted as representative of the mid-cloud region, as there is almost always a greater discrepancy from in situ values near cloud top and cloud base. We also find evidence of cases where Nd is accurately retrieved, but effective radius is not, presumably due to offsetting errors in other retrieval parameters. Vertical profiles of extinction coefficient β, liquid water content L, and effective radius re measured during sawtooth-pattern flight legs through cloud top are also compared to implicit MODIS retrieval profiles. For the one case with Nd agreement, all profiles match well. For seven cases with significant disagreement, there is no consistent underlying cause. The discrepancy originates from either: (a) discrepancy in the re profile, (b) discrepancy in the β and L profiles, or (c) discrepancy in both."

Here we present an annual series (2019–2022) of summer digital elevation models (PRODEMs) for the Greenland Ice Sheet margin, covering all outlet glaciers from the ice sheet.

With their high spatial and temporal resolution, the PRODEMs will enable detailed studies of the changes in marginal ice sheet elevations. 
 Surface topography across the marginal zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet is constantly evolving in response to changing weather, season, climate, and ice dynamics. However, current digital elevation models (DEMs) for the ice sheet are usually based on data from a multi-year period, thus obscuring these changes over time. Here we present four 500 m resolution summer DEMs (PRODEMs) of the Greenland Ice Sheet marginal zone for 2019 through 2022. The PRODEMs cover the marginal zone from the ice edge to 50 km inland, hence capturing all Greenland outlet glaciers. Each PRODEM is based on data fusion of CryoSat-2 radar altimetry and ICESat-2 laser altimetry using regionally varying kriging of elevation anomalies relative to ArcticDEM. The PRODEMs are validated using leave-one-out cross-validation, and PRODEM19 is further validated against an external data set, showcasing their ability to correctly represent surface elevations within the associated spatially varying prediction uncertainties. We observe a general lowering of surface elevations during the 4-year PRODEM period, but the spatial pattern of change is highly complex and with annual changes superimposed. The PRODEMs enable detailed studies of the marginal ice sheet elevation changes. With their high spatio-temporal resolution, the PRODEMs will be of value to a wide range of researchers and users studying ice sheet dynamics and monitoring how the ice sheet responds to changing environmental conditions. PRODEMs from summer 2019 through 2022 are available at https://doi.org/10.22008/FK2/52WWHG (Winstrup, 2024), and we plan to annually update the product henceforth."

 Airborne measurements are pivotal for providing detailed, spatiotemporally resolved information about atmospheric parameters and aerosol and cloud properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of dynamic atmospheric processes. For 30 years, the US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science supported an instrumented Gulfstream 1 (G-1) aircraft for atmospheric field campaigns. Data from the final decade of G-1 operations were archived by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Data Center and made publicly available at no cost to all registered users. To ensure a consistent data format and to improve the accessibility of the ARM airborne data, an integrated dataset was recently developed covering the final 6 years of G-1 operations (2013 to 2018, https://doi.org/10.5439/1999133; Mei and Gaustad, 2024). The integrated dataset includes data collected from 236 flights (766.4 h), which covered the Arctic, the US Southern Great Plains (SGP), the US West Coast, the eastern North Atlantic (ENA), the Amazon Basin in Brazil, and the Sierras de Córdoba range in Argentina.

 Spatiotemporal regression is a crucial method in geography for discerning spatiotemporal nonstationarity in geographical relationships and has found widespread application across diverse research domains. This study implements two innovative spatiotemporal intelligent regression models, i.e., Geographically Neural Network Weighted Regression (GNNWR) and Geographically and Temporally Neural Network Weighted Regression (GTNNWR), which use neural networks to estimate spatiotemporal nonstationarity. Due to the higher accuracy and generalization ability, these models have been widely used in various fields of scientific research. To facilitate the application of GNNWR and GTNNWR in addressing spatiotemporal nonstationary processes, the Python-based package GNNWR has been developed. This article details the implementation of these models and introduces the GNNWR package, enabling users to efficiently apply these cutting-edge techniques. Validation of the package is conducted through two case studies. The first case involves the verification of GNNWR using air quality data from China, while the second employs offshore dissolved silicate concentration data from Zhejiang Province to validate GTNNWR. The results of the case studies underscore the effectiveness of the GNNWR package, yielding outcomes of notable accuracy. This contribution anticipates a significant role for the developed package in supporting future research that will leverage big data and spatiotemporal regression techniques."

Particles from all samples exhibited two-phased behavior with a polar hydrophilic phase and a nonpolar hydrophobic phase. We used the poke-flow viscosity technique to estimate the viscosity of the particles. Both phases of the BBOA had viscosities of >108 Pa s at relative humidities up to 50%. Such high viscosities correspond to mixing times within 200 nm BBOA particles of >5 h. Two phases and high viscosity have implications for how BBOA should be treated in atmospheric models."

We used the poke-flow technique and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to measure the viscosity and hygroscopicity of SOA particles generated from the reaction of NO3 with guaiacol, termed guaiacol-NO3 SOA. The viscosity of this SOA is extremely high (≳5 × 107 Pa s) at RH ≲ 70% and drastically higher than other SOA types previously  investigated with the poke-flow technique at RH ≳ 40%. The high viscosity for guaiacol-NO3 SOA can be attributed, at least in part, to the low hygroscopicity measured via the QCM. From the viscosity results, we calculated the mixing times of organic molecules within guaiacol-NO3 SOA. The results suggest that mixing times within this type of SOA exceed 1 h for most tropospheric conditions, with possible implications for predicting the size, mass, and long-range transport of pollutants in phenolic SOA."

Here, we show an integrated underway observation of oceanic and atmospheric NO and NO2 from the coastal seas to the open ocean in the northwestern Pacific Ocean (NWPO). The concentrations of NO and NO2 showed similar distribution patterns that the coastal seas with rich nitrogen nutrients showed higher levels, like the Yellow Sea (7.6 and 19.9 pmol L–1) and the East China Sea (11.8 and 23.3 pmol L–1), while the oligotrophic sea and open ocean showed decreased levels, like the South China Sea (2.4 pmol L–1 and below the detection limit, LOD) and the NWPO (3.5 pmol L–1 and below the LOD). Apart from nitrogen nutrients, sea surface temperature might be another important influencing factor on the NO and NO2 distribution. In the surface water (<10 m), photoproduction was a major NO source compared to the microbial process, while in the mixed layer, the microbial process played a more critical role. The saturation values showed that the sea was a net source of atmospheric NO but was a net sink of NO2."

However, the mechanisms of formation  of aromatic aminiums in urban aerosols remain elusive. Highly time-resolved PM2.5 samples were collected in the center of Shanghai (China) during the winter to investigate the origin and formation of aminiums. The dominant aminium groups were aliphatic (mainly dimethylaminium and monomethylaminium). Anilinium was the third most abundant aminium. The concentrations of anilinium and total aminiums showed higher levels during the daytime and on weekdays. This finding combined with source apportionment analysis suggested that the daily and weekly scale variations of anthropogenic activities (e.g., traffic for commuting) were mainly responsible for the fluctuations in aminium concentrations (particularly aromatic aminiums). The acid dependence of aliphatic aminium formation was significantly stronger than that of aromatic aminium formation. Aliphatic and aromatic aminiums were significantly negatively and positively correlated with ozone, respectively, suggesting that the oxidative processes weakened the abundance of aliphatic aminiums but promoted the formation of aromatic aminiums. The molecular characterization of aromatic aminiums suggested that the atmospheric degradation of higher-molecular-weight aromatic amine compounds was an important mechanism for anilinium formation in urban aerosols. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the formation of  aromatic aminiums."

This study aimed to determine the sulfurous product distribution resulting from the nighttime oxidation of thiophene as a model system. Ion chromatography (IC) and aerosol mass spectrometry (a mini aerosol mass spectrometer, mAMS) were used to constrain the proportions of sulfurous compounds produced under wildfire-relevant conditions ([NO2]/[O3] = 0.1). With constraints from IC, results indicated that the sulfurous particle mass consisted of 30.3 ± 6.6% SO42–, while mAMS fractionation attributed 24.5 ± 1.6% of total sulfate signal to SO42–, 15.4 ± 1.9% to organosulfates, and 60.1 ± 0.9% to sulfonates. Empirical formulas of organosulfur products were identified as C1–C8 organosulfates and sulfonates using complementary mass spectrometry techniques.

Here, we evaluated variations in flash drought events in water-limited regions of China from 2001 to 2022 and quantified vegetation resistance (its ability to maintain predrought level) and resilience (its capacity to bounce back from droughts) to flash drought based on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and gross primary productivity. The average frequency of flash droughts was approximately 3.5 events per decade and the duration increased significantly by 3 d during 2001–2022. We found that vegetation resistance to flash drought did not show significant temporal changes, while resilience decreased significantly. Spatially, as aridity increased, vegetation resistance gradually decreased while resilience rose. The strong negative correlation between resistance and resilience demonstrated a trade-off in individual climate regions, which varied among different vegetation types. Among eight vegetation types, evergreen needleleaf forest, evergreen broadleaf forest and mixed forest displayed high-resistance and low-resilience, while deciduous needleleaf forest exhibited both high-resistance and high-resilience. Furthermore, we revealed that aridity index, vapor pressure deficit, and temperature were the most relevant environmental variables for both vegetation resistance and resilience, but had opposite effects and different magnitudes. Our findings highlight that the vulnerability and stability of terrestrial ecosystems are decreasing and are affected by water availability."

Here we use multiple sources of observations, reanalysis data, and model simulations to examine the responses of fire activity to climate change over northeastern China in the past two decades. We detected significant positive burned area (BA) trends in this region since 2003 during spring and much stronger interannual variations in BA in the last decade. We then separated the study region into cropland and natural vegetation and found that the increasing BA trends come mainly from agricultural burning. Our results also show that temperature is the dominant driver for BA variations in natural vegetation, whereas agricultural burning is influenced by precipitation, although human activities largely contribute to BA variations due to farming practices and land use and management. Our results further suggest that tropical North Atlantic (TNA) sea surface temperatures (SST) variability regulates the fire weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) in northeastern China through the Rossby wave train from the tropical Atlantic to the Eurasian continent. The cooling of TNA SST since 2010 could induce an anomalous anticyclonic circulation around Northeast Asia, leading to sinking motion and divergence in the region and resulting in reduced precipitation and warm temperatures. Thus, the co-occurrence of warm and dry anomalies has led to more frequent burning since the 2010s. Our study not only detects recent BA variations in northeastern China but also provides further evidence for the remote impact of TNA variability on recent BA and climate variations over the region."

A better understanding of its chemical evolution is a challenge for Africa, where it is still undersampled. Out of 14 sites examined (1995–2020), high levels of O3 are reported in southern Africa. The dominant chemical processes leading to O3 formation are identified. A decrease in O3 is observed at Katibougou (Mali) and Banizoumbou (Niger), and an increase is found at Zoétélé (Cameroon) and Skukuza (South Africa). 
 For nearly 30 years, the International Network to study Deposition and Atmospheric chemistry in AFrica (INDAAF) programme has measured surface ozone from 14 sites in Africa representative of the main African ecosystems: dry savannas (Banizoumbou, Niger; Katibougou and Agoufou, Mali; Bambey and Dahra, Senegal), wet savannas (Lamto, Côte d'Ivoire; Djougou, Benin), forests (Zoétélé, Cameroon; Bomassa, Republic of the Congo) and agricultural–semi-arid savannas (Mbita, Kenya; Louis Trichardt, Amersfoort, Skukuza and Cape Point, South Africa). The data are collected with passive samplers and archived as monthly averages; quality assurance is maintained by INDAAF's calibration and intercomparison protocols with other programmes employing the same systems. This analysis reports on correlations of INDAAF ozone time series (1995–2020) with local meteorological parameters and with ozone precursors, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), derived from standard global databases. Mean annual averages of surface ozone range from 3.9 ± 1.1 ppb (Bomassa) to 30.8 ± 8.0 ppb (Louis Trichardt), reflecting a general positive gradient from west central Africa to South Africa. At the decade scale, from 2000 to 2020, the Katibougou and Banizoumbou sites (dry savanna) experienced a significant decrease in ozone of around −2.4 and −0.8 ppb per decade, respectively. These decreasing trends are consistent with those observed for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and BVOCs. An increasing trend is observed in Zoétélé (2001–2020), estimated at +0.7 ppb per decade, and at Skukuza (2000–2015; +3.4 ppb per decade). The increasing trends are consistent with increasing biogenic emissions at Zoétélé and NO2 levels at Skukuza. Very few surface O3 measurements exist in Africa, and the long-term results presented in this study are the most extensive for the ecosystems studied. The importance of maintaining long-term observations like INDAAF cannot be overstated. The data can be used to assess ozone impacts on African crops. For the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report Phase II (TOAR II), they provide invaluable constraints for models of chemical and climate processes in the atmosphere."

Bednarz;Jim Haywood,How does the latitude of stratospheric aerosol injection affect the climate in UKESM1?,"Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) refers to a climate intervention by which aerosols are intentionally added to the high atmosphere to increase the amount of reflected sunlight and reduce Earth's temperature. The climate outcomes of SAI depend on the latitude of injection. While injecting aerosols at the Equator has undesirable side effects, injecting away from the Equator has different effects on temperature, rainfall, ozone, and atmospheric circulation, which are analysed in this work. 
 Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) refers to a climate intervention method by which aerosols are intentionally added to the lower stratosphere to enhance sunlight reflection and offset some of the adverse effects of global warming. The climate outcomes of SAI depend on the location, amount, and timing of injection, as well as the material used. Here, we isolate the role of the latitude of SO2 injection by comparing different scenarios that have the same global-mean temperature target, altitude of injection, and hemispherically symmetric injection rates. These are as follows: injection at the Equator (EQ) and injection at 15° N and S (15N+15S), 30° N and S (30N+30S), or 60° N and S (60N+60S). We show that injection at the Equator leads to a substantial undercooling of the Arctic, a significant reduction in tropical precipitation, reductions in high-latitude ozone, heating in the tropical lower-stratosphere, and strengthening of the stratospheric jets in both hemispheres. Additionally, we find that the most efficient injection locations are the subtropics (15 and 30° N and S), although the 60N+60S strategy only requires around 30 % more SO2 injection for the same amount of cooling; the latter also leads to much less stratospheric warming but only marginally increases high-latitude surface cooling. Finally, while all the SAI strategies come with trade-offs, our work shows that the 30N+30S strategy is a good candidate strategy for an intermodel comparison and is easier to implement than a multi-latitude controller algorithm."

OA was mainly attributed to the monoterpene oxidation products. The mixing ratios of BVOCs were higher than the values previously measured in other temperate forests. The results demonstrate that BVOCs are influenced not only by meteorology and biogenic emissions but also by local anthropogenic emissions and subsequent chemical transformation processes. 
 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are key components of the atmosphere, playing a significant role in the formation of organic aerosols (OAs). However, only a few studies have simultaneously examined the characteristics of BVOCs and OAs in forest ecosystems on the background of environmental stressors, such as consecutive droughts and extensive bark beetle infestations. Here, we present real-time measurements of OAs and BVOCs in a stressed spruce-dominated forest near a biogas power plant (BPP) in western Germany during June 2020. A proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with a particle inlet (CHARON-PTR-ToF-MS) and a Vocus-PTR-ToF-MS were used to measure OAs and BVOCs. The average OA mass concentration was 0.8 ± 0.5 µg m−3, consisting mainly of semi-volatile monoterpene oxidation products. The average mixing ratios of isoprene (0.58 ± 0.54 ppb) and monoterpenes (2.5 ± 5.3 ppb) were higher than the values previously measured in both German temperate forests and boreal forests. Based on a wind direction analysis, BVOC data were categorized into two groups: one mainly influenced by biogenic emissions from an intact forest and a clear-cut area (referred to as the biogenic group) and the other mainly influenced by anthropogenic emissions from a BPP and a village (referred to as the anthropogenic group). High mixing ratios of monoterpenes were observed in the anthropogenic group, indicating a significant contribution of BPP emissions. In the biogenic group, the variations in BVOC mixing ratios were driven by the interplay between meteorology, biogenic emissions and their photochemical consumption. Positive matrix factorization analysis of VOCs revealed substantial contributions of oxygenated organic compounds from the photochemical oxidation of BVOCs during daytime, while monoterpenes and their weakly oxidized products dominated at night. Furthermore, increasing relative humidity and decreasing temperatures promoted the gas-to-particle partitioning of these weakly oxidized monoterpene products, leading to an increase in nighttime OA mass. The results demonstrate that variations in BVOCs are influenced not only by meteorological conditions and biogenic emissions but also by local BPP emissions and subsequent chemical transformation processes. This study highlights the need to investigate the changes in biogenic emissions in stressed European forests."

A parameterization equation relating JNO3−–HONO to OC/NO3− has been established and can be used to estimate JNO3−–HONO in different environments. Our work provides an important reference for research in other regions of the world where aerosol samples have a high proportion of organic components. 
 The production mechanism of atmospheric nitrous acid (HONO), an important precursor of the hydroxyl radical (OH), remains controversial. Few studies have explored the effects of particulate nitrate photolysis on HONO sources under different environment conditions across China. In this work, the photolysis rate constant of particulate nitrate for HONO production (JNO3--HONO) was determined through a photochemical reaction system with PM2.5 samples collected from five representative sites in China. We developed a method to correct and quantify the “shadowing effect” – potential light extinction within aerosol layers under heavy PM2.5 loading conditions on the filters – for JNO3--HONO measurements, showing that elemental carbon (EC), the dominant light-absorbing component in PM2.5, plays a dominant role in it. The corrected JNO3--HONO values varied with the sampling period and location over a wide range, from 1.6 × 10−6 to 1.96 × 10−4 s−1, with a mean (±1 SD) of 1.71 (± 2.36) × 10−5 s−1. Chemical compositions, specifically those concerning nitrate loading and organic components, affected the production of HONO through particulate nitrate photolysis: high JNO3--HONO values were generally associated with PM2.5 samples with a high organic carbon (OC) / NO3- ratio (R2 = 0.86). We suggest that the parameterization equation between JNO3--HONO and the OC / NO3- ratio established in this work can be used to estimate JNO3--HONO under different aerosol chemical conditions, thus reducing the uncertainty in exploring daytime HONO sources. This study confirms that the photolysis of particulate nitrate can be a potential daytime HONO source in rural or southern urban sites, which are characterized by PM2.5 containing high proportions of organic matter."
10.5194/amt-17-6769-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文介绍了一种利用偏振遥感技术反演海洋上层液态水云的云覆盖度和光学厚度的新方法。该方法特别适用于多角度偏振测量卫星观测数据，例如HARP2。与传统方法不同，它不依赖于观测的空间分辨率，也不需要云检测的阈值。研究利用辐射传输模拟，证明云覆盖度和光学厚度可以由两个观测角度的测量数据推导出来：一个在云虹区域，另一个在太阳闪光区域。在云虹区域，偏振度主要取决于云光学厚度；而在太阳闪光区域，偏振度则取决于像素的晴空比例。该方法使用简单的查找表方法进行反演，并通过灵敏度研究表明，风速和气溶胶光学厚度等先验信息可以提高云覆盖度反演的精度，云滴大小分布的先验信息可以降低云光学厚度反演的不确定性。论文还讨论了三维散射效应的影响，并用specMACS机载观测数据验证了该方法的有效性，结果表明该方法能够准确反演不同云覆盖度下的云覆盖度和光学厚度。总而言之，这项研究为利用卫星遥感技术监测云特性提供了一种新的有效方法，具有重要的应用价值。,"['cloud fraction', 'cloud optical thickness', 'liquid water clouds', 'polarimetry', 'multi-angle polarization measurements', 'satellite observations', 'airborne observations', 'radiative transfer']",Claudia Emde;Veronika Pörtge;Mihail Manev;Bernhard Mayer,Retrieval of cloud fraction and optical thickness of liquid water clouds over the ocean from multi-angle polarization observations,"We introduce an innovative method to retrieve the cloud fraction and optical thickness of liquid water clouds over the ocean based on polarimetry. This is well suited for satellite observations providing multi-angle polarization measurements. Cloud fraction and cloud optical thickness can be derived from measurements at two viewing angles: one within the cloudbow and one in the sun glint region. 
 We introduce a novel method to retrieve the cloud fraction and the optical thickness of liquid clouds over a water surface based on polarimetry. The approach is well suited for satellite observations providing multi-angle polarization measurements, in particular those of the Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter #2 (HARP2). Unlike commonly used methods to derive cloud fractions, our method does not depend on the spatial resolution of observations, and it does not require any threshold values for cloud detection. Based on radiative transfer simulations, we show that the cloud fraction and the cloud optical thickness can be derived from measurements at two viewing angles: one within the cloudbow and one in the sun glint region. In the cloudbow, the degree of polarization mainly depends on the cloud optical thickness. Conversely, for a viewing direction in the sun glint region, the degree of polarization depends on the clear fraction of the pixel, because here the radiation scattered by cloud droplets is almost unpolarized, whereas radiation reflected by the surface is highly polarized. Utilizing these dependencies, we developed a retrieval using a simple lookup table approach. Based on sensitivity studies, we show that prior information about wind speed and aerosol optical thickness improves the accuracy of the cloud fraction retrieval. Prior information about the cloud droplet size distribution can reduce the uncertainty of the cloud optical thickness retrieval. The prior information should be obtained by combining our method with already existing aerosol and cloud retrieval algorithms. We performed 3D radiative transfer simulations and found that the cloud optical thickness is generally underestimated due to neglect of 3D scattering effects. The cloud fraction is overestimated in cloud shadows and underestimated in in-scattering regions.As a demonstration, we apply the methodology to airborne observations from polarization cameras of the Munich Aerosol Cloud Scanner (specMACS) instrument. The high-spatial-resolution data (10–20 m) have been averaged to a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5 km to mimic satellite observations. From the average linear polarization at scattering angles of 140 and 110°, we derive continuous cloud fraction values and the corresponding cloud optical thicknesses. Comparison for cases including low, medium, and high cloud fractions shows that the retrieval, using only reflected polarized radiances at two scattering angles, provides accurate estimates of the cloud fraction for observations with coarse spatial resolution."

NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 has better computing efficiency, excels when used with a small ensemble size, and can significantly improve the simulation performance of chemical components. 
 Identifying PM2.5 chemical components is crucial for formulating emission strategies, estimating radiative forcing, and assessing human health effects. However, accurately describing spatiotemporal variations in PM2.5 chemical components remains a challenge. In our earlier work, we developed an aerosol extinction coefficient data assimilation (DA) system (Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System with the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (NAQPMS-PDAF) v1.0) that was suboptimal for chemical components. This paper introduces a novel hybrid nonlinear chemical DA system (NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0) to accurately interpret key chemical components (SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, OC, and EC). NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 improves upon v1.0 by effectively handling and balancing stability and nonlinearity in chemical DA, which is achieved by incorporating the non-Gaussian distribution ensemble perturbation and hybrid localized Kalman–nonlinear ensemble transform filter with an adaptive forgetting factor for the first time. The dependence tests demonstrate that NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 provides excellent DA results with a minimal ensemble size of 10, surpassing previous reports and v1.0. A 1-month DA experiment shows that the analysis field generated by NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 is in good agreement with observations, especially in reducing the underestimation of NH4+ and NO3- and the overestimation of SO42-, OC, and EC. In particular, the Pearson correlation coefficient (CORR) values for NO3-, OC, and EC are above 0.96, and the R2 values are above 0.93. NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 also demonstrates superior spatiotemporal interpretation, with most DA sites showing improvements of over 50 %–200 % in CORR and over 50 %–90 % in RMSE for the five chemical components. Compared to the poor performance in the global reanalysis dataset (CORR: 0.42–0.55, RMSE: 4.51–12.27 µg m−3) and NAQPMS-PDAF v1.0 (CORR: 0.35–0.98, RMSE: 2.46–15.50 µg m−3), NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 has the highest CORR of 0.86–0.99 and the lowest RMSE of 0.14–3.18 µg m−3. The uncertainties in ensemble DA are also examined, further highlighting the potential of NAQPMS-PDAF v2.0 for advancing aerosol chemical component studies."

We used these observations to attribute emissions to major sources, including the landfill work face, where new waste is placed at the landfill and gas-control infrastructure. Methane emissions from the work face appeared to be more prevalent than gas-control infrastructure emissions, with 52 landfills exhibiting work face emissions out of the 115 observed landfills shown to be emitting in 2023. Landfills with work face emissions were often the highest emitters, especially sites with associated renewable natural gas facilities, and the total average site emissions from these landfills accounted for 79% of the observed emissions, indicating inefficient gas capture at these sites. Landfills with work face emissions also displayed the greatest disparity between observed emission rates and hourly emission rates that we estimated using annual emissions reported to the US EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Work face emissions present a major opportunity for methane mitigation: Observed emissions from work face emitting-landfills in this study were equivalent to 15% of US methane emissions from municipal solid waste landfills in 2022, as reported in the 2024 Greenhouse Gas Inventory, though these landfills accounted for only 4% of open sites in the US. As the 217 landfills in this study cover only 17% of open landfills in the US, the total mitigation potential is likely greater. Using remote sensing, we find that the largest contributor to observed methane emissions at US landfills is the landfill work face, an area of the landfill often left out of the required monitoring and traditional emissions accounting methods."

Global fittings indicate that around 40% of TCs exhibit decelerating decay (β≤1) $(\beta \le 1)$, while the majority (about 60%) show accelerating decay (β>1) $(\beta  > 1)$.

Moreover, high proportions of secondary inorganic aerosols sources (SNA) were identified by PMF without corresponding primary sources. This study develops a new method that combines multi‐isotopes (34S, 15N, 18O and 14C) and PMF model to optimize source apportionment. Data sets A–F, constructed from PM2.5 components, were input into PMF model to obtain optimal results (3–9 factors), which changed with the selection of species. Specifically, the contributions of coal combustion (CC, 3%–36%), biomass burning (BB, 11%–38%), and vehicle sources (VS, 4%–15%) showed significant differences in data sets, indicating that conventional methods cannot obtain accurate results. Then, 15N, 34S, 18O were introduced to restrict and reallocate identified SNA sources to primary sources, overcoming the influence of species on results. Additionally, 14C was used to evaluate data sets results, which showed that the combination of PMF model with more markers (data set F, 9‐factor) and multi‐isotopes techniques obtained optimized results that aligned with 14C results. Compared with the initial results, the contributions of CC, VS, and BB in the allocated 9‐factor increased by 26.4%, 5%, and 19.5%, respectively, becoming main sources of PM2.5.

 Satellite earth observation (EO) data plays a vital role quantifying vegetation structural and functional metrics across spatio-temporal scales. However, the degree of coupling between satellite derived spectral signals and the rate of photosynthesis, as estimated by Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), both before and after bushfire remain understudied, yet these are a critical part of the global carbon cycle. This study evaluated a combination of passive optical and active LiDAR satellite data to quantify the disturbance and recovery of photosynthesis from a major fire event. The work was completed at the Tumbarumba long-term tall eucalypt flux site following a catastrophic bushfire in December 2019. TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and Sentinel 2 derived greenness and burn severity metrics (NDVI, EVI, NIRv, and NBR) were investigated, termed ‘spectral metrics’ herewith. Detailed in-situ observations from leaf-to-canopy scales were utilised to examine variations in vegetation structural-functional parameters.We found the rate of vegetation spectral metrics recovery largely outpaced GPP recovery at the one- and two-year post-fire mark. Specifically, SIF recovered to 80–90 % compared to pre-fire levels, whereas GPP recovered only 45–50 %. This indicated that separate SIF:GPP functions were required for pre- and post-fire data to account for different recovery trajectories due to changes in canopy structure and species composition. The use of TROPOMI SIF for monitoring canopy productivity at seasonal (monthly) time-scales was advantageous over traditional greenness-based indices, as SIF tracked GPP seasonality both pre- and post-fire. Spaceborne GEDI LiDAR data effectively captured post-fire changes in forest structure, albeit at sparse spatio-temporal sampling intervals, revealing a significant reduction in overstorey vegetation density and a concurrent increase in understorey vegetation density. This contributed to reduced carbon uptake, compared to pre-fire, due to the lower light use efficiency of understorey species, which was verified with in-situ gas exchange measurements. Overall, this study highlights the importance of accounting for disturbance history and the relative abundance of overstorey and understorey vegetation for tracking GPP from satellite platforms. Our results also highlight the crucial role of longitudinal field-based data for calibration and validation of EO data, ultimately enhancing our understanding of forest recovery processes."

 Surface soil moisture (SM) plays an important role in water and energy cycles. Passive microwave remote sensing observation has become the main means of obtaining large-scale surface SM. Due to its low spatial resolution, the spatial downscaling is required. With the development of artificial intelligence, data-driven SM downscaling models have emerged in recent years and have shown better accuracy than traditional physical models. However, data-driven SM downscaling models still have problems such as poor interpretability and easy overfitting. Therefore, this paper proposes a new SM downscaling model based on physical rule-constrained deep learning, named Physics-informed Soil Moisture Downscaling Deep Neural Network (PhySoilNet). This model adds the physical relationship between SM and the downscaling factor Land surface Evaporative Efficiency, as well as the saturated and residual boundary of SM into the Loss function of deep learning, thereby constraining the neural network. Results showed that PhySoilNet successfully downscaled the 9 km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM to 500 m, and performed well in the evaluations with in-situ, aerial, and SMAP SM. Compared to the downscaling model of only data-driven, the PhySoilNet had better performance in all evaluations, and the metrics in the in-situ SM network evaluation were improved by 20 % for R, 9.9 % for ubRMSE, 7.2 % for MAE, and 7.2 % for RMSE. At the same time, the number of SM predicted by PhySoilNet that outside the reasonable SM boundary range was significantly reduced. This fully demonstrates that data-driven based on physical rule constraints can achieve SM downscaling more effectively. Coupling physical rules and deep learning can fully utilize the powerful fitting ability of data-driven methods while improving the generalization ability and interpretability of downscaling models through prior physical knowledge."

 Monitoring the distribution and size of long-living large shrubs, such as junipers, is crucial for assessing the long-term impacts of global change on high-mountain ecosystems. While deep learning models have shown remarkable success in object segmentation, adapting these models to detect shrub species with polymorphic nature remains challenging. In this research, we release a large dataset of individual shrub delineations on freely available satellite imagery and use an instance segmentation model to map all junipers over the treeline for an entire biosphere reserve (Sierra Nevada, Spain). To optimize performance, we introduced a novel dual data construction approach: using photo-interpreted (PI) data for model development and fieldwork (FW) data for validation. To account for the polymorphic nature of junipers during model evaluation, we developed a soft version of the Intersection over Union metric. Finally, we assessed the uncertainty of the resulting map in terms of canopy cover and density of shrubs per size class. Our model achieved an F1-score in shrub delineation of 87.87% on the PI data and 76.86% on the FW data. The R2 and RMSE of the observed versus predicted relationship were 0.63 and 6.67% for canopy cover, and 0.90 and 20.62 for shrub density. The greater density of larger shrubs in lower altitudes and smaller shrubs in higher altitudes observed in the model outputs was also present in the PI and FW data, suggesting an altitudinal uplift in the optimal performance of the species. This study demonstrates that deep learning applied on freely available high-resolution satellite imagery is useful to detect medium to large shrubs of high ecological value at the regional scale, which could be expanded to other high-mountains worldwide and to historical and fothcoming imagery."

 Regional variations in atmospheric moisture residence time (RT) highlight the need to obtain independent observation indexes to constrain different model-based estimates. Stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen naturally exist in water molecules that can provide such observational constraints. We analyzed the relationship between RT and precipitation isotopes (δ2H and δ18O) across different climatic zones in Eurasia from 1980 to 2020. Our analysis reveals that: (1) Both precipitation isotopes and RT showed significant increasing trends during 1980–2020. The increase in RT corresponds to weakened net isotopic distillation over Eurasia, suggesting reduced atmospheric circulation intensity under warming conditions. (2) The spatial patterns of RT and precipitation isotopes vary significantly among different moisture source regions, reflecting distinct moisture transport and precipitation formation processes. (3) On long-term scales, RT generally shows positive correlations with precipitation isotopes, except in plateau regions. The RT-δ18O relationship exhibits latitude-dependent variations, with similar slopes in regions sharing common moisture sources. These findings enhance our understanding of the long-term controls on precipitation isotopic composition and atmospheric moisture cycling patterns across Eurasia."

Steven,Climate refugia in the Great Barrier Reef may endure into the future,"Although global warming is leading to more frequent mass coral bleaching events worldwide, parts of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) have consistently escaped severe coral bleaching. Modeling and satellite observations show that climate refugia are created by the upwelling of cooler water to the surface through the interactions of tides and currents with dense reef structures. Here, we use a high-resolution nested regional ocean model to investigate the future status of two relatively large refugia. On the basis of model projections under a high-emission scenario, we find that the upwelling mechanisms will stay active in a warming climate, and these regions are likely to remain approximately more than 1°C cooler than surrounding waters until at least into the 2080s, providing thermal relief to corals. Identification and protection of these refugia may help facilitate reef survival and related biodiversity preservation by allowing their corals time to acclimatize and adapt and ultimately provide source populations to replenish the rest of the reef."

Controversy over the reasonableness of such baseline scenarios has thrown this nascent market mechanism into disarray. While new technical approaches to baseline-setting that promise wider market acceptance are set to roll out in the coming years, existing projects are becoming unviable, as carbon credit buyers reduce investment due to lost confidence in the integrity of emissions reduction claims. Transparent, reproducible methods to assess existing REDD+ project baselines are needed in order to provide a clearer picture of the real impact of projects, and provide an objective basis on which investment decisions can be made today. Here we introduce such a method. In contrast to existing studies which utilize only one method to create a single ‘control,’ we integrate actual forest loss rates from a variety of control sites to establish a ‘zone of reasonable accuracy (or ZORA)’. Application of our method in Cambodia, using two geospatial datasets (one global and one locally calibrated), shows that all three project baselines fall within or below ZORA. This approach is fully reproducible, and provides a transparent way for analysts to assess REDD+ baselines during this critical time when investment in forest protection must increase dramatically and without delay."
10.5194/acp-24-13317-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇文章探讨了对流层化学机制发展中的挑战和需求。文章的核心是化学机制的构建，这直接关系到大气模型的准确性，而大气模型是进行空气质量预测和气候变化研究的基础。文中提到了化学机制构建过程中需要考虑的实验数据（实验室、野外、环境舱）和理论数据（量子化学、理论动力学、机器学习），以及数据收集、机制构建和评估的严格程序。文章还讨论了在全球变化背景下（例如排放情景变化导致新的化学体系，野火，特大城市）发展新的气相和水相化学机制的需求，以及改进机制以更好地模拟氧化能力和气溶胶化学对气候、人类和生态系统健康的影响。由于文章关注的是大气化学机制的构建及其在空气质量和气候变化研究中的应用，而这些研究都与大气环境遥感技术（例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）密切相关，因此该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有很强的相关性。,"['tropospheric chemistry', 'air pollution', 'climate change', 'chemical mechanism', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality modeling', 'satellite observation', 'remote sensing']",Barbara Ervens;Andrew Rickard;Bernard Aumont;William P.

Wallington,Opinion: Challenges and needs of tropospheric chemical mechanism development,"Chemical mechanisms describe the chemical processes in atmospheric models that are used to describe the changes in the atmospheric composition. Therefore, accurate chemical mechanisms are necessary to predict the evolution of air pollution and climate change. The article describes all steps that are needed to build chemical mechanisms and discusses the advances and needs of experimental and theoretical research activities needed to build reliable chemical mechanisms. 
 Chemical mechanisms form the core of atmospheric models to describe degradation pathways of pollutants and ultimately inform air quality and climate policymakers and other stakeholders. The accuracy of chemical mechanisms relies on the quality of their input data, which originate from experimental (laboratory, field, chamber) and theoretical (quantum chemistry, theoretical kinetics, machine learning) studies. The development of robust mechanisms requires rigorous and transparent procedures for data collection, mechanism construction and evaluation and the creation of reduced or operationally defined mechanisms. Developments in analytical techniques have led to a large number of identified chemical species in the atmospheric multiphase system that have proved invaluable for our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. At the same time, advances in software and machine learning tools have enabled automated mechanism generation. We discuss strategies for mechanism development, applying empirical or mechanistic approaches. We show the general workflows, how either approach can lead to robust mechanisms and that the two approaches complement each other, resulting in reliable predictions. Current challenges are discussed related to global change, including shifts in emission scenarios that result in new chemical regimes (e.g., low-NO scenarios, wildfires, mega- and gigacities) and that require the development of new or expanded gas- and aqueous-phase mechanisms. In addition, new mechanisms should be developed to also target oxidation capacity and aerosol chemistry impacting climate, human and ecosystem health."
10.5194/acp-24-13269-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了船舶排放的微粒对云的影响，特别是对液态水路径（LWP）的影响。研究者利用船舶航迹作为天然实验，结合卫星观测数据，分析了气溶胶扰动后云的演变。他们发现，先前研究中存在系统性偏差，导致高估了气溶胶对LWP的影响。修正偏差后，他们发现平均而言，气溶胶扰动对LWP的影响较弱，只有在特定情况下（例如，降水或清洁的海洋层积云）才观察到明显的正响应。这项研究强调了在分析孤立的机遇性实验中的细微之处，修正了先前研究中关于气溶胶对LWP响应的差异，对气候变化研究中辐射强迫的估算具有重要意义。,"['Aerosol', 'Cloud', 'Liquid Water Path (LWP)', 'Satellite observation', 'Ship tracks', 'Radiative forcing', 'Climate change', 'Marine stratocumulus clouds']",Anna Tippett;Edward Gryspeerdt;Peter Manshausen;Philip Stier;Tristan W. P. Smith,Weak liquid water path response in ship tracks,"Ship emissions can form artificially brightened clouds, known as ship tracks, and provide us with an opportunity to investigate how aerosols interact with clouds. Previous studies that used ship tracks suggest that clouds can experience large increases in the amount of water (LWP) from aerosols. Here, we show that there is a bias in previous research and that, when we account for this bias, the LWP response to aerosols is much weaker than previously reported. 
 The assessment of aerosol–cloud interactions remains a major source of uncertainty in understanding climate change, partly due to the difficulty in making accurate observations of aerosol impacts on clouds. Ships can release large numbers of aerosols that serve as cloud condensation nuclei, which can create artificially brightened clouds known as ship tracks. These aerosol emissions offer a “natural”, or “opportunistic”, experiment to explore aerosol effects on clouds, while also disentangling meteorological influences. Utilizing ship positions and reanalysis wind fields, we predict ship track locations, colocating them with satellite data to depict the temporal evolution of cloud properties after an aerosol perturbation.  Repeating our analysis for a null experiment does not necessarily recover zero signal as expected; instead, it reveals subtleties between different null-experiment methodologies. This study uncovers a systematic bias in prior ship track research, due to the assumption that background gradients will, on average, be linear. We correct for this bias, which is linked to the correlation between wind fields and cloud properties, to reveal the true ship track response.We find that, once this bias is corrected for, the liquid water path (LWP) response after an aerosol perturbation is weak on average. This has important implications for estimates of radiative forcings due to LWP adjustments, as previous responses in unstable cases were overestimated. A noticeable LWP response is only recovered in specific cases, such as marine stratocumulus clouds, where a positive LWP response is found in precipitating or clean clouds. This work highlights subtleties in the analysis of isolated opportunistic experiments, reconciling differences in the LWP response to aerosols reported in previous studies."

Our understanding of BrC from real-world biomass burning remains limited, complicating the determination of its radiative impact. Our study reports absorption properties of BrC emitted from four major biomass burning sources using field measurements in India. It develops an absorption parameterization for BrC and examines the spatial variability in BrC's absorption strength across India. 
 In South Asia, biomass is burned for energy and waste disposal, producing brown carbon (BrC) aerosols whose climatic impacts are highly uncertain. To assess these impacts, a real-world understanding of BrC's physio-optical properties is essential. For this region, the order-of-magnitude variability in BrC's spectral refractive index as a function of particle volatility distribution is poorly understood. This leads to oversimplified model parameterization and subsequent uncertainty in regional radiative forcing. Here we used the field-collected aerosol samples from major anthropogenic biomass activities to examine the methanol-soluble BrC optical properties. We show a strong relation between the absorption strength, wavelength dependence, and thermo-optical fractions of carbonaceous aerosols. Our observations show strongly absorbing BrC near the Himalayan foothills that may accelerate glacier melt, further highlighting the limitations of climate models where variable BrC properties are not considered. These findings provide crucial inputs for refining climate models and developing effective regional strategies to mitigate BrC emissions."

We present a new dataset of three years of NO2 vertical profiles in Toronto, Canada, and evaluate it using NO2 from satellite and surface monitoring networks and simulations by an air quality forecast model. We quantify and explain the differences among the datasets to provide information that can be used to understand NO2 variability. 
 The purpose of this work is to derive new NO2 vertical profiling data products from Pandora spectrometers and investigate the factors contributing to the bias of this dataset relative to established ground-based and spaceborne datasets. Possible applications of the NO2 vertical profile dataset include air quality monitoring and satellite validation studies. We explore the application of the optimal estimation method to Pandora multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements to retrieve vertical profile information for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). We use the Heidelberg Profile (HeiPro) retrieval algorithm to derive, for the first time, NO2 profiles and partial columns (0–4 km) from Pandora MAX-DOAS measurements from 2018–2020 at Downsview, a suburban neighbourhood in the north end of Toronto, Canada that is subject to local traffic emissions and urban influences. Validation of the new dataset was done via comparison with official Pandora direct-Sun measurements, in situ observations, satellite data, and an air quality forecasting model. We find that, for tropospheric partial column comparisons, the HeiPro dataset has a positive mean relative bias to Pandora direct-Sun (61 % ± 9.7 %) and TROPOMI (41 % ± 47 %) observations, as well as the GEM-MACH model output (61 % ± 7.5 %), with similar seasonal and diurnal cycles in the bias with Pandora direct-Sun and GEM-MACH. Contributing factors to the large bias of HeiPro to Pandora direct-Sun were investigated, and NO2 heterogeneity, combined with differences between direct-Sun and multi-axis viewing geometries, was found to contribute a maximum of 52 % of the total relative bias during morning measurement times. For surface NO2 comparisons, we find that HeiPro measurements capture the magnitude and diurnal variability of surface NO2 reasonably well (mean relative bias to in situ surface NO2: −8.9 % ± 7.6 %) but are low-biased compared to GEM-MACH (mean relative bias: −36 % ± 2.4 %). Compared to HeiPro, the GEM-MACH model profiles are high-biased in the lower boundary layer and low-biased in the free troposphere."

The gridded nighttime AOT retrievals, compared against Aerosol Robotic Network data, show reasonable skill levels for potential data assimilation, air quality and climate studies of significant events. 
 Using observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day-Night Band (DNB), we examined the feasibility of developing a gridded nighttime aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data set based on the spatial derivative of measured top-of-atmosphere attenuated upwelling artificial lights at night (ALAN) over the US, Middle-East and Indian Subcontinent regions for 2017. We also studied the potential of using NASA’s standard operational Black Marble nighttime lights product suite (VNP46) for estimating the spatial derivatives of surface artificial light emissions, that is one of the key lower boundary conditions for the retrieval process. Sensitivity of nighttime aerosol retrievals to observing conditions and different methods of estimating the spatial derivative of surface artificial light emissions were also explored. Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSEs) of ~ ~0.15 and ~0.18 and correlations of ~0.8 and ~0.6 were found between VIIRS nighttime AOT and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) nighttime and daytime data, respectively, suggesting that the proposed gridded nighttime AOT retrievals have reasonable skill levels for potential data assimilation, air quality and climate studies of significant events. We also found that NASA Black Marble products can be used to estimate the spatial derivative of surface artificial light emissions for nighttime AOT retrievals over regions that are not frequently contaminated by aerosol plumes, such as the USA. This study demonstrated the feasibility of constructing a gridded nighttime AOT data, using artificial lights, for monitoring of nighttime aerosol events over large spatial and temporal domains. Given the deployment of VIIRS instruments (currently in orbit and forthcoming) on board the NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System series satellites, this study can be viewed as a precursor for gridded nighttime AOT retrievals at both regional and global scales in the future. We also show that the use of the NASA Black Marble products, which would greatly save processing time of this method, is challenging over regions with frequent aerosol pollution such as the Indian Subcontinent and further exploration is required."

Errors in the ECMWF model's scheme for predicting ocean skin temperature prompted a revision of the ocean mixed layer model. Validation against infrared measurements and buoys showed a good correlation with minimal deviations. The revised model accurately simulates SST variations and aligns with solar radiation distributions, showing promise for weather and climate models. 
 Sea surface temperature (SST) is a crucial parameter in climate, weather, and ocean sciences due to its decisive role in ocean–atmosphere interactions. Identifying errors in the prognostic scheme used by the current European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model for predicting the diurnal variation in ocean skin temperature led to a revisit and revision of the ocean mixed layer (OML) model. Validation of the revised model was conducted by comparing simulated temperatures at the sub-skin level and 1 m depth with observations from shipborne infrared measurements and buoys. These comparisons revealed a strong correlation, with an absolute mean deviation of less than 0.1 K and a standard deviation under 0.5 K, which are found to be comparable to errors in satellite observations of SST. Given that these results are derived from the same model simulations, the error statistics for the simulated skin temperature and its diurnal variation should have the same degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the simulation results closely align with anticipated solar radiation distributions, whereas ERA5 ocean skin temperature shows a significant lack of alignment with solar radiation. Consequently, the revised OML model shows promising potential for improving the simulation of diurnal SST variations in weather and climate models."

A sum of 142,982 participants without GI cancer at baseline were derived from the National Urban Cancer Screening Program in Beijing (2013–2019). The 5 year averaged concentrations of PM2.5 mass and its five constituents, namely, black carbon (BC), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3–), organic matter (OM), and inorganic sulfate (SO42–), were estimated by using a hybrid machine learning model. The Cox proportional hazard model with fixed effects was used to explore the associations between PM2.5 mass and its constituents with the incidence of GI cancer. The double-exposure linear model, the mixture exposure model of quantile-based g-computation, and an explainable machine learning model were utilized to evaluate the importance of different PM2.5 constituents. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 mass and its constituents was linearly associated with GI cancer; the estimated hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of per standard deviation increment were 1.367 (95% CI: 1.257 to 1.487) for PM2.5 mass, 1.434 (95% CI: 1.307 to 1.574) for BC, 1.255 (95% CI: 1.169 to 1.349) for NH4+, 1.217 (95% CI: 1.139 to 1.301) for NO3–, 1.410 (95% CI: 1.287 to 1.546) for OM, and 1.410 (95% CI: 1.288 to 1.542) for SO42–.

However, the overall surface and subsurface effects of eddies on the Southern Ocean biogeochemistry have not been quantified observationally at a large scale. Here, we co‐locate eddies, identified in the Meta3.2DT satellite altimeter‐based product, with biogeochemical Argo floats to determine the effects of eddies on the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), nitrate, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the upper 1,500 m of the ice‐free Southern Ocean, as well as the eddy effects on the carbon fluxes in this region. DIC and nitrate concentrations are lower in anticyclonic eddies (AEs) and increased in cyclonic eddies (CEs), while dissolved oxygen anomalies switch signs above (CEs: positive, AEs: negative) and below the mixed layer (CEs: negative, AEs: positive). We attribute these anomalies primarily to eddy pumping (isopycnal heave), as well as eddy trapping for oxygen. Maximum anomalies in all tracers occur at greater depths in the subduction zone north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) compared to the upwelling region in the ACC, reflecting differences in background vertical structures. Eddy effects on air–sea CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ exchange have significant seasonal variability, with additional outgassing in CEs in fall (physical process) and additional oceanic uptake in AEs and CEs in spring (biological and physical process). Integrated over the Southern Ocean, AEs contribute ∼0.03± ${\sim} 0.03\pm $ 0.01 Pg C yr−1 ${\text{yr}}^{-1}$ (7 ±2% $\pm 2\%$) to the Southern Ocean carbon uptake, and CEs offset this by ∼0.01± ${\sim} 0.01\pm $0.01 Pg C yr−1 ${\text{yr}}^{-1}$ (2 ±2% $\pm 2\%$).

The ground ionosonde observations of h’F from near‐equatorial locations, along with the latitudinal profiles of plasma densities from Swarm satellites reveal the first observational evidence of the impact of strong IMF‐By near the dusk‐terminator (17–19.5 LT), causing strong dawn‐to‐dusk ionospheric electric fields during northward IMF‐Bz. This electric field produces large uplift of the ionospheric plasma near equator and subsequent super‐fountain effect near the dusk.

The mechanisms behind this extreme cold event remain unclear. This study uses the circulation projection method to detect and quantify the contributions of various factors to this extreme cold event. The findings indicate that large‐scale atmospheric circulation anomalies are the predominant factors triggering this cold wave. The Polar‐Eurasian (POL)‐like teleconnection pattern is identified as a key driver for the cold anomalies, contributing approximately 85% of total cold anomalies in Northern East Asia in this event. Although the POL‐like teleconnection is largely internally generated, the preceding low sea ice levels in the Barents and Kara Seas can strengthen and maintain POL teleconnection. Additionally, preceding November increased snow cover in Northern East Asia can further amplify this cold event by enhancing local surface albedo and reducing incoming solar shortwave radiation."

The rarity and stochastic nature of these extreme events makes it difficult to understand their physical drivers, temporal trends, and future likelihood. To address this challenge, we turn to extreme value theory to investigate past trends in annual maxima iceberg area and assess the likelihood of high‐magnitude calving events. We use 47 years of iceberg size from satellite observations. Our analysis reveals no upward trend in the surface area of the largest annual iceberg over this time frame. This finding suggests that extreme calving events such as the recent 2017 Larsen C iceberg, A68, are statistically unexceptional and that extreme calving events are not necessarily a consequence of climate change. Nevertheless, it is statistically possible for Antarctica to experience a calving event up to several times greater than any in the observational record."

We describe a previously unreported, visually spectacular season of iridescent, noctilucent clouds visible in early southern autumn from the Curiosity rover's site in Gale crater. Ice nucleation begins near sunset with a narrow range of particle sizes, and the ice aerosols grow and precipitate. The iridescence, visible through three‐color imaging, arises from locally uniform particle sizes resulting from similar growth histories. Colorful fall streaks show the clouds evolving, and a scattering corona shows size uniformity over large areas. The terminator was observed on the clouds, allowing the determination of cloud altitudes and a likely CO2 composition.

In this study, a significant increasing trend is detected for TC destructiveness, primarily measured by precipitation, and for TC‐induced damage, measured by direct economic losses (DELs), in the inland areas of East China. In contrast, a similar trend cannot be observed in the coastal regions. The rapid increase of TC‐induced damage in the inland areas of East China is directly related to an increase of the annual number of disastrous TCs, which is a result of the increased TC landfall frequency and the increased TC decay timescale after landfall. The increase in specific humidity, soil moisture, and the decrease in vertical wind shear in East China favor the survival of TCs inland. Our results highlight the significance of TC disaster prevention in the inland regions."

Traditional radiation simulations of such instruments often overlook the influence of slant observation geometry by using vertical profile assumption, leading to inadequate simulation accuracy. By using global atmospheric profiles with 1 km spatial resolution, the slant‐path effects on brightness temperature simulations are quantified. Experiments indicate that the slant geometry has less impact on longwave brightness temperature simulations and has a substantial impact on middle‐wave brightness temperature simulations. It may introduce 0.5 K (or more) uncertainty to brightness temperatures of water vapor absorption channels when the satellite zenith angle is greater than 45°.

The IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) network and the Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) operate in mostly rural/remote or urban/suburban sites, respectively. The networks have similar sampling schedules and analysis methods. Regional, monthly, and annual mean concentrations from 2019 to 2022 were calculated for ammonium sulfate (AS), ammonium nitrate (AN), particulate organic matter (POM), elemental carbon (EC), fine dust (FD), and sea salt (SS), as well as their relative contributions to reconstructed PM2.5 mass (RCFM). Organic aerosols were the largest contributor to RCFM across the United States (>40% annually, up to 80% monthly), with significant impacts from biomass smoke on POM and EC concentrations, contributions, and seasonality. AS concentrations and contributions were similar in urban and rural regions and contributed <20% annually to RCFM, considerably less than two decades ago. In general, urban concentrations were greater for AN, POM, and EC, suggesting additional urban sources. Some species, such as POM, FD, and AN, exhibited strong seasonal variability due to episodic source impacts or seasonal formation conditions. Evaluating the urban and rural monthly variability of major aerosol species is necessary for understanding the impacts of emission sources, regional transport, and atmospheric processes governing aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere."

The excellent spatial and temporal coverage of satellite data makes them critical to the validation of ash dispersion model forecasts. This study investigates the limitations of satellite‐retrieved volcanic ash data through the production of simulated radiances for a range of ash cloud properties encompassing the satellite retrieval's sensitivity. We run a detection and retrieval algorithm (Francis et al., 2012, https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JD016788) on these simulated ash clouds and assess the sensitivity and performance of the algorithms. Expected limitations are highlighted, including a lack of sensitivity to particles larger than ∼10 μm in radius and challenges in accurately retrieving heights in the stratosphere. However, other previously poorly defined limitations are also constrained, such as the reduction in sensitivity as ash column loading increases in optically thick ash clouds and increasingly underestimated column loading when column loadings are >∼7 g m−2. We consider the implications of the identified limitations when using satellite‐retrieved ash column loadings to verify dispersion model output. We show that, accounting for the limitations of the satellite retrieval, a significant proportion of mass in the model output can lie outside the sensitivity range of the satellite detection and retrieval. This demonstrates the importance of understanding observations' limitations when comparing to model output. This knowledge should be used when verifying operational volcanic ash cloud forecasts."

Although the simulation portrays gravity waves in the stratosphere in a complex structure, it reveals a concentric‐ring pattern of gravity waves in the mesosphere. The waves closely resemble the airglow image acquired by Suomi National Polar‐orbiting Partnership satellite near the mesopause. This intriguing phenomenon of the emergence of concentric rings after passing the stratopause is investigated by analyzing wave characteristics, including horizontal wavenumbers, frequency, and phase speed. The analysis reveals that the wind filtering effect directly influences the behavior of gravity waves, leading to variations in their appearance with altitude. The wind filtering effect, which typically breaks symmetric ring waves, could help reveal the ring pattern when the waves are subject to interference. Consequently, the concentric rings, propagating faster than the background winds, are shown to originate from the cloud tops of the storm complex. A wind duct at a specific location is identified through spectral analysis. This mechanism is further elucidated with the assistance of the dispersion relation of a classical linear theory."

However, its characteristics in the marine atmosphere have rarely been investigated. This study investigated the abundances of HMS over the Yellow and East China Seas based on island and cruise observations, showing weak seasonal variations but significant spatial patterns. Aerosol pH was diagnosed as the limiting factor governing the production rates of HMS via the traditional aqueous processing. However, the disparities between the theoretical formation rates and observed concentrations implied the possibility of a new formation mechanism for HMS. Strong correlations were found between methanesulfonate (MSA) and HMS, with machine learning simulation indicating MSA as the most pivotal contributor. Through the density functional theory calculations, HMS can be generated by gas‐phase organic reactions between the •OOCH2SO3H radical (formed from the isomerization of methylsulfonoxyl radical (CH3SO3•) and oxidation) and NO or CH3OO• radical, leading to the cogeneration of HMS and MSA. The HMS production rate via the gas phase process was 3.7–55 times larger than that of aqueous processing, which extends the understanding of formation mechanisms of atmospheric organosulfur compounds."

Particle size distribution, particulate chemical composition, and gaseous pollutants were monitored in Rehovot, Israel (31°53″N 34°48″E) during two campaigns: from April 29 to 3 May 2021 (Campaign 1) and from May 3 to 11 May 2023 (Campaign 2), coinciding with an intensive bonfire burning festival. The organic aerosols (OA) source apportionment identified two major factors—Hydrocarbon‐like OA and Biomass‐burning OA—as well as two secondary factors—MO‐OOA (more oxidized‐oxygenated OA) and LO‐OOA (low oxidized oxygenated OA). NPF events were frequently observed during the day (mostly well‐defined nucleation events) and at night (burst of ultrafine mode particles without any discernible growth). A condensation sink value of (9.4 ± 4.0) × 10−3 s−1 during Campaign 1 and (14.2 ± 6.0) × 10−3 s−1 during Campaign 2 was obtained. The daytime events were associated with enhanced sulfuric acid proxy concentrations of (2–12) × 106 molecules cm−3, suggesting the role of gas‐phase photochemistry in promoting NPF. A novel approach of hybrid positive matrix factorization analysis was used to deconvolve the chemical species responsible for the observed events. The results suggest the involvement of multiple components, including ammonium sulfate and MO‐OOA, in the nucleation; Nitrate, HOA and LO‐OOA participate in the subsequent particle growth for the daytime events. Nighttime events involve only semi‐volatile species (LO‐OOA, HOA and nitrate) along with ammonium sulfate."

However, there is a scarcity of comprehensive understanding on their origins and formation pathways. In this study, 14 particulate NACs were measured at high time resolution at the summit of Mount Tai over North China Plain in winter with an average concentration of 30.5 ng m−3. The relatively higher concentrations and distinct diurnal profiles of NACs suggest the occurrence of strong secondary formation driven from polluted urban plumes transported by mountain‐valley breezes, elevated NOx and precursor levels, and strong oxidation capacity. An observationally constrained multiphase chemical box model was developed and employed to elucidate the origins and formation pathways of NACs. They mainly came from the air mass transport from the polluted urban regions to the mountaintop during the day, while the nocturnal NACs formation is dominated by the partitioning of gaseous NACs to the particle phase and heterogenous processes on aerosols. This work provides observational evidence of elevated NACs levels at high mountain site as well as modeling reference for multiphase processes of particulate NACs and the contributions from different formation pathways to a large degree addressing the problem of underestimation in traditional models."

This change is closely linked to the notable increase in the IIV of April surface air temperatures over Northeast Asia from the former period (1986–2001) to the latter period (2002–2016). Further analysis also highlights a salient impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the strengthened IIV in vegetation. During the latter period, there is a substantial increase in the IIV of the March NAO compared with the former period. This greater variability allows the positive NAO to significantly influence the net heat fluxes, thereby leading to a positive phase of the North Atlantic tripole (NAT) sea surface temperature (SST) pattern in March. Given the persistence of SSTs, the positive NAT SST pattern lasts to April, subsequently causing positive height anomalies over Northeast Asia through a wave train that originates from the North Atlantic and propagates downstream. This process consequently results in an increase in surface air temperature over Northeast Asia and hence the local vegetation. Thus, the increased IIV of the March NAO is conducive to enhancing the IIV in spring vegetation over Northeast Asia."

Fang,Characteristics of the Spatiotemporal Distribution of Influenza Incidence and Its Driving Factors Among Residents in Mainland China From 2004 to 2018,"The incidence rate of urban influenza in Chinese Mainland shows a seasonal fluctuation of six months. On the spatial scale, the agglomeration area is located in cities in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Urbanization and air pollution are the main driving factors of the incidence rate of influenza.

Influenza is an acute respiratory infection that spreads rapidly and widely in densely populated areas with low vaccination coverage. The trends and drivers of the spatial and temporal dynamics of influenza incidence among residents of mainland China have not been systematically studied. This study comprehensively analyses the dynamics and spatial correlation of influenza using long‐term scale data and spatial panel data. It then identifies the interactive process of socio‐economic and natural elements on the incidence of influenza. The highest prevalence of influenza was found in the 0–4 years age group in mainland China (mean prevalence, 67.56/100,000). In addition, influenza in mainland China shows seasonality, with fall and winter being the periods of high incidence. Between 2014 and 2017, influenza incidence was clustered in Hubei and Anhui provinces, and the spatial clustering was statistically significant (Z value > 1.96, P < 0.05). Moreover, the directionality of influenza onset continued to increase each year. Specifically, the clustering of influenza onset was stronger in the northwest‐southeast direction than in the southwest‐northeast direction between 2014 and 2018.

 Glaciers in the Arctic have lost considerable mass during the last two decades. About a third of the glaciers by area drains into the ocean, yet the mechanisms and drivers governing mass loss at glacier calving fronts are poorly constrained in part due to few long-term glacier-ocean observations. Here, we combine a detailed satellite-based record of calving front ablation for Austfonna, the largest ice cap on Svalbard, with in-situ ocean records from an offshore mooring and modelled freshwater runoff for the period 2018-2022. We show that submarine melting and calving occur almost exclusively in autumn for all types of outlet glaciers, even for the surging and fast-flowing glacier Storisstraumen. Ocean temperature controls the observed frontal ablation, whereas subglacial runoff of surface meltwater appears to have little direct impact on the total ablation. The seasonal warming of the offshore waters varies both in magnitude, depth and timing, suggesting a complex interplay between inflowing Atlantic-influenced water at depth and seasonally warmed surface water in the Barents Sea. The immediate response of frontal ablation to seasonal ocean warming suggests that marine-terminating glaciers in high Arctic regions exposed to Atlantification are prone to rapid changes that should be accounted for in future glacier projections.

 The winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), one of the leading modes of atmospheric variability in the Northern Hemisphere and key driver of surface climate anomalies, was long considered to be spatially stable. Yet, its northern center-of-action – the Icelandic Low (IL) – shifted eastward in the late 1970s compared to the preceding decades of the mid-20th century. The responsible processes are still uncertain, particularly after the decline of the positive NAO trend in the 21st century. Here, we present observational and model evidence that the NAO-IL moves naturally alternating between two preferential locations, west/east of Iceland, with no need for changes in anthropogenic forcing or low-frequency oceanic variability. These recurrent longitudinal displacements of the NAO pattern appear linked to zonal changes in the fluctuations (not mean-state) of transient-eddy activity, emphasizing the relevance of internal atmospheric variability, and could represent a major source of uncertainty in regional climate prediction and projection."

 Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter that critically contributes to Earth’ s climate. Thermal anisotropy is a major challenge that must be addressed while generating long-term LST products from satellites. For instance, the differences between GOES-16 and GOES-17 LST products caused by thermal anisotropy have not yet been resolved, which impacts the high-frequency monitoring of the land surface. The coupled contributions of the gap fraction and hotspot effects in the thermal infrared domain result in the existence of thermal anisotropy effect. The time-evolving kernel-driven model (TEKDM) is a recently proposed practical tool for conducting LST angular normalization for geostationary satellites. However, the existing six-parameter TEKDM considers only the hotspot effect and ignores the gap fraction effect, which may limit the TEKDM-based angular normalization method. In this study, we proposed an extended seven-parameter TEKDM considering both the gap fraction and hotspot effects and normalized the angular effect of GOES-16 and GOES-17 LST products over the overlapping region using this model. The accuracy of this seven-parameter TEKDM was evaluated using a physically based discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) simulation dataset. Subsequently, the seven-parameter TEKDM-based angular normalization method was evaluated using the GOES-16 and GOES-17 LST products of the overlapping region for one year against ten AmeriFlux sites. The results showed that the seven-parameter TEKDM had a RMSE (MBE) of 0.36 K (0.0019 K). Compared with the RMSE of the NOAA-released GOES LST products, the seven-parameter TEKDM-based normalization method could reduce the RMSE of GOES-16 and GOES-17 LST products from 2.2 K and 2.6 K to 1.7 K, respectively, with a reduction of 0.5 K (22.7 %) and 0.9 K (34.6 %), respectively. Furthermore, the RMSE/MBE of GOES-17 LST exhibited a different diurnal variation pattern than that of GOES-16 LST, which could be explained by the different illumination-viewing geometries of the two satellites. This emphasizes the necessity of conducting angular normalization of current geostationary satellite LST products. The seven-parameter TEKDM provides a feasible method for generating long-term high-quality LST datasets for remote sensing communities."

 Deep convective clouds (DCCs) are crucial in the Earth's energy budget. Although the abundant DCC-generated ice-phase anvil and cirrus theoretically have a warming effect, the reported observations of their cloud radiative effect (CRE) by previous studies are unexpectedly negative. Here, we find that the apparent contradiction between theory and observations resulted from neglecting the radiative contribution of background underlying clouds based on the five-years active and passive satellite observations in global. The probability of underlying clouds below the anvils is up to 2/3. They can contribute up to 70 % of the observed total shortwave cooling effect when they fully overlap with anvils. After excluding the effect of underlying clouds, most of the anvil CRE changes sign from negative to positive, increasing by over +25 W/m2, especially over land. This revelation suggests a substantially underestimated warming effect of DCC anvils and cirrus in previous observations. Also, it may imply an underestimated aerosol-driven positive radiative forcing on DCC, which has been estimated as neutral previously."

 This study aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal concentration of air pollutants in the tropospheric layer of Jordan, in the Middle East, for 2019–2022. The study utilized remotely sensed data from two satellite systems, Sentinel-5P and Landsat-9, to retrieve information about the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) and land use types, respectively. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and JavaScript were used to produce monthly short-term average concentration maps and time series for the three pollutants. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of Sentinel-5P data against ground-based monitoring stations in estimating NO2, SO2, and CO concentration at a regional scale. Results revealed a moderate correlation, with r-values of 0.42, 0.43, and 0.40, for NO2, SO2, and CO, respectively.

 Machine learning (ML) models have been widely utilized for the prediction of ground-level ozone (O3), one of the most concerning air pollutants in China. However, many of the ML models tend to underestimate high O3 levels, likely due to the class imbalance issue within the input training data. In this study, we combined data from ground monitoring stations (CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, MDA8 O3, longitude, and latitude), satellite observations (HCHO column concentration) and meteorological variables (2m temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind components, surface pressure, precipitation, evaporation, boundary layer height, and cloud cover) to assess the impact of data imbalance on prediction performance. Results demonstrated that ML models without considering data imbalance issue severely underestimate high O3 levels. We proposed a sample weighting-based support vector regression model (SVR-W) that fully considered the data imbalance. Based on data from 2026 monitoring stations across 31 provinces in China, the SVR-W model achieved an average bin-slope value between observed and predicted O3 of 0.74 ± 0.12 (s.d.), which is significantly better than commonly used ML models (0.64 ± 0.11). The average bin-RMSE of the SVR-W model was 26.7μg/m3, outperforming other models. The average recall of high O3 levels was 11–31% higher than commonly used ML models. The SVR-W model demonstrated improved prediction performance for both regular and extreme pollutant O3 levels based on the three metrics.

 The Dark Target (DT) algorithm has been applied to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi-NPP (SNPP) and NOAA-20 satellites to extend the aerosol data record from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). The newly released VIIRS DT Version 2.0 (V2.0) dataset includes NOAA-20 aerosol products for the first time. This study provides the first evaluation of NOAA-20 VIIRS DT aerosol products, including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångstrom exponent (AE), for the period 2018–2022 using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) measurements. In addition, the operational DT aerosol products from SNPP VIIRS (V2.0) and MODIS (Collection 6.1) are also used for comparison purposes. Overall, NOAA-20 AODs over land and ocean exhibit good validation metrics globally, showing comparability to MODIS products and superiority over overestimated SNPP products. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that in South Africa specifically, NOAA-20 land AODs tends to display more pronounced negative biases, despite all products being underestimated. Furthermore, all ocean AE products demonstrate high correlation coefficients (>0.83) with the ground-based data, meeting the fraction of expected accuracy (>80%). Encouragingly, NOAA-20 AE product has significantly improved the persistent issue of overestimation at low-value in MODIS product, making it a more preferable choice for usage. Error analysis reveals that the performance of all three land products decreases in sparsely vegetated areas and when the solar zenith angle is small. However, NOAA-20 AOD exhibits relatively stable performance and is less affected by variations in aerosol loading, observation geometry, and surface vegetation cover. In addition, the performance of AOD and AE over ocean is significantly influenced by scattering angle and wind speed. This research is anticipated to serve as a reference for the utilization of operational VIIRS DT aerosol products and possible algorithm optimization."

 The diurnal temperature range (DTR), determined by the difference between daily maximum and minimum air temperature, is an important index of global climate change. The dust direct radiative effect on DTR in cloudy conditions in the Taklimakan Desert (TD) area is still unclear. Based on springtime ground observation data from 2002 to 2013, the DTR variation in dust/cloudy days and the DTR-visibility relationship in dust days in TD were analyzed and summarized. The mean DTR was proportional to the mean visibility, with a slow DTR increase in the southwestern TD caused by cloud-induced radiation when visibility was 4–10 km; the DTR difference between cloudy and cloudless dust days was more significant (1.8–4.2 °C) when visibility was >6 km. The simulation of a long-lasting dust-cloud coexisting event (4 days) with the factor separation technique showed that both pure dust- and cloud-radiation impacts reduced DTR but their synergistic radiation impact mostly increased DTR in TD. Both simulated and observed results indicated that when the daily visibility of dust weather increased from 4-6 km to 6–10 km, the important pure dust impact on DTR weakened whereas the cloud impact became significant."

The highest value of dust AAOD (DUAAOD) is in SD (0.030–0.040), and the contribution rate reaches 80 %; while in SC, SEA, and AMZ, black carbon AAOD (BCAAOD) contributes 80 %–90 %. The high-value area of DUAAOD in SD-ME-NWC expands in spring, and the dust belt formed in summer results in a larger DUAAOD (> 0.050). The proportion of BCAAOD in autumn and winter is larger in the dust belt, which is another major contributor to AAOD in this region. The monthly distributions of TAAOD in SEA, CSA, NC, and AMZ are mainly affected by biomass combustion, while the DU in ME (Middle East), NWC (Northwestern China), and SD has a greater effect on AAOD, and the TAAOD in NEA (Northeastern Asia), WEU (Western Europe), EUS (Eastern United States), SC, SA (Southern Asia), and other regions is mainly affected by both DU and BC + OC (in which OC refers to organic carbon). The interannual variations of BCAAOD and OCAAOD tend to be flat before 2000, and then show an increasing trend. BCAAOD has the largest relative contribution (at about 60 %), followed by DUAAOD (at about 30 %), and then OCAAOD has the smallest contribution (at less than 10 %). From a global perspective, AAOD shows different increasing trends during 1980–2018, 1980–1992, and 1993–2005, and decreases or even completely reverses during 2006–2018. This paper provides the distribution characteristics and evolutionary trends of different chemical components of AAOD, which can improve scientific understanding of global- and regional-scale aerosols and their climatic effects."

 This study investigates the sensitivity of dust event simulation to dust emission schemes and meteorological forcing datasets in the Belt and Road regions, which we divided into three dust-affected regions: North Africa, the Middle East-central Asia, and East Asia. The Weather Research and Forecasting model with online coupled chemistry (WRF-Chem) is used to simulate a dust event in the Belt and Road regions from June 15 to 20, 2016. Nine experiments were conducted using three sets of dust emission schemes (GOCART, Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport; AFWA, Air Force Weather Agency; UoC, University of Cologne) and three meteorological forcing datasets (NCEP FNL, National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final; ECMWF ERA5, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5; JMA JRA-55, Japan Meteorological Agency 55-year Reanalysis). The accuracy and applicability of the schemes and datasets were verified and evaluated by the global atmospheric reanalysis data, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), as well as observed data from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and CloudAerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The main conclusions drawn from the simulation of this dust event are as follows: In the Middle East-central Asia and East Asia, the uncertainty in the dust emission schemes is greater than that in the meteorological forcing datasets, while in North Africa, they are comparable. Among the schemes, GOCART is generally more applicable across the three dust-affected regions compared to AFWA and UoC. Additionally, JRA-55 shows a slight advantage over FNL and ERA5 in North Africa and the Middle East-central Asia. Significant differences in the spatial distribution of dust emissions are observed among experiments using different dust emission schemes, whereas slight differences are noted among those with different meteorological forcing datasets; notably, dust optical depth (DOD) distribution closely aligns with dust emissions."

 Regarding global warming and climate change, carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most important greenhouse gases. Simulating CO2 gas at hourly/weekly time intervals and desired vertical resolution is challenging due to the coarse horizontal resolution of global models. In this study, both column-averaged CO2 mixing ratio (XCO2) and vertical cross sections of CO2 mixing ratio were simulated by the Weather Research and Forecast Green House gas (WRF-GHG) model at spatial resolutions of 30 and 10 km for the Middle East region as the first domain, and Iran as the second domain. Simulations consider the primary CO2 sources (anthropogenic, biogenic, fire, and oceanic) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) dataset. XCO2 retrieved from GOSAT satellite observations was employed to evaluate the simulation results of the column-averaged CO2 concentrations in February and August 2010. The evaluations showed that the spatiotemporal variability of meteorological variables was well simulated by WRF-GHG with correlation coefficients r of 0.86–0.92, 0.67–0.75, and 0.76–0.82 for temperature, wind, and relative humidity, respectively, during February and August 2010. The evaluations also indicated that the WRF-GHG simulations outperformed the global model TM3, with mean bias error values of − 0.79 and 0.45 PPMV for WRF-GHG in February and August, respectively. The percentage contribution of net CO2 emissions from human activities in Iran was calculated as (38.33 % and 23.70 %) of the total emissions, respectively, with values of 4.4 and 0.85 kg/km2 in each month. The net emissions contributions of biogenic, fire, and oceanic sources were evaluated in February and August, with biogenic emissions contributing (31.901 % and 27.66 %), biogenic absorption contributing (24.07 % and 46.63 %), fire emissions contributing (5.7 % and 2.064 %), and oceanic emissions contributing (3.23 × 10−6 % and 2.23 × 10−6 %). Large-scale circulations and biogenic activity are responsible for the major features of the spatial and seasonal distribution of CO2 in the area. In February, column mixing ratios are higher in more northern latitudes; in August, they are higher to the south. Furthermore, the simulated vertical cross sections show high CO2 mixing ratios in the mid-lower troposphere and northerly/northeasterly advection in February; the vertical profile is inverted in August with high concentrations in the lower stratosphere associated with southwesterly advection. However, the interaction between the synoptic and sub-synoptic features with the topography determines the precise dispersion and distribution of CO2. Despite the negligible emissions in central and eastern Iran, these factors play an important role in the observed concentrations in February and August. In August, the areas between the 120-day low-level monsoon flow of Sistan in eastern Iran, and the westerlies over western/southwestern Iran and the Zagros Mountain range, interact with the heat-low in the Iranian plains and with the Arabian subtropical high. In February, the dominant winds in western Asia were west winds, with the main source of pollution coming from the northeastern regions flowing towards central and eastern Iran. The equatorward displacement of the polar jet stream and the passage of low-pressure systems from the west in winter cause a temporary reduction in CO2 concentrations."

Klein;Allan K. Bertram;Andreas Zuend;Florence Gregson;Ulrich K. Krieger,Viscosity of aqueous ammonium nitrate–organic particles: equilibrium partitioning may be a reasonable assumption for most tropospheric conditions,"The viscosity of ammonium nitrate–sucrose–H2O was quantified with three methods ranging from liquid to solid state depending on the relative humidity. Moreover, the corresponding estimated internal aerosol mixing times remained below 1 h for most tropospheric conditions, making equilibrium partitioning a reasonable assumption. 
 The viscosity of aerosol particles determines the critical mixing time of gas–particle partitioning of volatile compounds in the atmosphere. The partitioning of the semi-volatile ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) might alter the viscosity of highly viscous secondary organic aerosol particles during their lifetimes. In contrast to the viscosity of organic particles, data on the viscosity of internally mixed inorganic–organic aerosol particles are scarce. We determined the viscosity of an aqueous ternary inorganic–organic system consisting of NH4NO3 and a proxy compound for a highly viscous organic, sucrose. Three techniques were applied to cover the atmospherically relevant humidity range: viscometry, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and the poke-flow technique. We show that the viscosity of NH4NO3–sucrose–H2O with an organic to inorganic dry mass ratio of 4:1 is  4 orders of magnitude lower than the viscosity of the aqueous sucrose under low-humidity conditions (30 % relative humidity (RH), 293 K). By comparing viscosity predictions of mixing rules with those of the Aerosol Inorganic–Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients Viscosity  (AIOMFAC-VISC) model, we found that a mixing rule based on mole fractions performs similarly when data from corresponding binary aqueous subsystems are available. Applying this mixing rule, we estimated the characteristic internal mixing time of aerosol particles, indicating significantly faster mixing for inorganic–organic mixtures compared to electrolyte-free particles, especially at lower RH. Hence, the assumption in global atmospheric chemistry models of quasi-instantaneous equilibrium gas–particle partitioning is reasonable for internally mixed single-phase particles containing dissolved electrolytes (but not necessarily for phase-separated particles), for most conditions in the planetary boundary layer. Further data are needed to see whether this assumption holds for the entire troposphere at midlatitudes and at RH > 35 %."

Understanding this composition of PM is important for identifying its sources, assessing potential health risks, and developing strategies to reduce air pollution. The PX-375 monitor proved to be a valuable tool for ongoing air quality monitoring studies and could be particularly useful as pollution levels and sources change in the future. 
 Knowledge of the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM) is essential for understanding its source distribution, identifying potential health impacts of toxic elements, and developing efficient air pollution abatement strategies. Traditional methods for analysing PM composition, such as collection on filter substrates and subsequent offline analysis with, for example, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), are time-consuming and prone to measurement errors due to multiple preparation steps. Emerging near-real-time techniques based on non-destructive energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) offer advantages for continuous monitoring and source apportionment.This study characterizes the Horiba PX-375 EDXRF monitor by applying a straightforward performance evaluation including (a) limit of detection (LoD), (b) identification and quantification of uncertainty sources, and (c) investigation and comparison of measurement results from three contrasting sites in Luxembourg (urban, semi-urban, rural). We used multi-element reference materials (ME-RMs) from UC Davis for calibration and performed measurements during spring and summer 2023. The LoDs for toxic elements like Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb were below 3 ng m−3 at 1 h time resolution. Higher LoDs were observed for lighter elements (e.g. Al, Si, S, K, Ca). Expanded uncertainties ranged between 5 % and 25 % for elemental concentrations above 20 ng m−3 and were maximal for concentrations below 10 ng m−3, reaching 60 %–85 %. Elemental analysis revealed S and mineral elements (Fe, Si, Ca, Al) as dominant contributors to PM10. Although the PM mass contribution of toxic trace elements (e.g. Zn, Cu, As) was generally very low, they were found to be enriched at the urban site Belvaux and the semi-urban site Remich compared to the more rural site Vianden. Our results explained on average 51 %–74 % of the gravimetric PM10 mass at the three sites. The study highlights the suitability and importance of the continuous PX-375 particle monitor for future air quality monitoring and source apportionment studies, particularly under changing emission scenarios and air pollution abatement strategies."

Despite decades of research, wildfires are still challenging to represent in air quality and chemistry-climate models. Wildfire plume rise (injection) is one of those poorly resolved processes and is also a major source of uncertainty in evaluating the wildfire impacts on air quality. Studies have shown that current plume rise models are subject to large uncertainties, including the Freitas Scheme, a widely used 1-dimensional, cloud-resolving subgrid model. In this work, a new machine learning-based plume rise emulator is presented, trained using a high-resolution, turbulence-resolving large eddy simulation (LES) model coupled with microphysics. The preliminary results show that this machine learning emulator outperforms the benchmark model, the Freitas scheme, in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, a bagging ensemble is built to further increase the robustness and to battle internal variability. Efforts have been made to ensure that the machine learning emulator is robust, transparent, and not overtrained, and the results are interpretable and physically sound. Overall, this Plume Rise Emulating System using Machine Learning (PRESML) is a promising solution for regional and global air quality and chemistry-climate models."

As heatwaves of increasing severity occur, communities face more serious exposure to ozone, necessitating a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of heatwaves on the nonlinear response of ozone to its precursors for guiding policies in emission reductions. Here we estimate the spatiotemporal evolution of global ozone chemistry based on machine learning and in situ observations and show that emission changes and heatwaves alter ozone photochemical regimes, leading to diverse ozone changes across regions. Sustained emission reductions in East Asia decreased the ozone formation sensitivity to formaldehyde (HCHO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), counteracting the adverse high-temperature effect. Quantified results reveal that heatwaves increased the sensitivity of ozone to HCHO and PM2.5, enhancing their positive contributions and causing increased ozone trends across most regions, with a global average anomaly of 9.4 μg/m3. Meanwhile, heatwave-induced PM2.5 anomalies concentrated in wildfire-risk zones, coupled with increased HCHO, elevated downwind ozone levels. Specifically, the effects in wildfire-endangered western Canada and heatwave-exposed southeastern United States contributed to a chemically driven ozone increase of 0.18 μg/m3/month in Northern America. Our results demonstrate that more targeted and substantial regulation of volatile organic compounds will be beneficial in mitigating future intensifying climate penalty effects."

The impact of key environmental parameters, including ozone, initial uFA concentration, relative humidity, and temperature, on the decay rates was rigorously examined. Distinct kinetic behaviors were observed across different temperature ranges (TR1: 5–13 °C; TR2: 13–22 °C; TR3: 22–26 °C; TR4: 26–30 °C). Arrhenius plots of the decay rates revealed contrasting effective activation energies under TR2 and TR4, likely due to different phase states of aerosols and reaction mechanisms under varying environmental conditions. This study extends previous laboratory research by incorporating a wider range of ambient conditions, uncovering the complex interactions between environmental factors and the decay kinetics of uFAs. The findings provide critical insights for accurately modeling the fate of ambient organic aerosols and understanding the intricate impacts of atmospheric conditions on aerosol chemistry."

Biases with respect to the height of the aerosol plume and excessive subsidence have previously been documented in MERRA‐2. This paper further diagnoses these biases, and addresses the unreasonable subsidence over the southeast Atlantic region currently simulated by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model during the first deployment of the ORACLES campaign in September 2016. Our study is based on model simulations where the meteorological state is constrained by the GEOS‐based MERRA‐2 reanalysis, as well as by ERA5, using the so‐called replay technique. Free running simulations with the GEOS model show excessive subsidence that begins over land such that aerosol transported by the easterly jet reaches a strip of complex terrain and is forced downward; a similar behavior can be found in the MERRA‐2 reanalysis. This excessive subsidence has been somewhat reduced by improved parameterizations found in recent versions of the GEOS model. However, any replay constrained by MERRA‐2 meteorology, even those based on recent versions of GEOS, suffer from the same excessive subsidence. An additional set of simulations in which the GEOS model was free‐running was used to quantify the role of aerosol itself in adjusting the profile of vertical motion. While self‐lofting of biomass burning aerosol reduces the subsidence over the ocean, the magnitude of its impact is only a fraction of the bias in MERRA‐2."

Using a Lagrangian approach, we investigated the moisture transport regime and identified the circulation pattern responsible for the EPE. The primary moisture sources were the northwest Pacific (24%), southeast China (21%), and the South China Sea (20%). The circulation pattern, featuring the western Pacific subtropical high to the northeast, tropical cyclone KHANUN in the northwest Pacific, and a low‐pressure system southwest of the Hai River Basin, predominantly controlled the moisture transport. We discovered that an unprecedented EPE in 1963 exhibited a similar circulation pattern. By classifying historical EPEs into three categories based on seven atmospheric predictors, we identified circulation patterns associated with disaster‐prone events. The most frequent category is characterized by a circulation pattern with positive geopotential height anomalies in northeast Asia and negative anomalies to the south, extending from the northwest Pacific to the Hai River Basin. This classification provides insights into the atmospheric conditions conducive to severe EPEs in the region."

 Antarctica is currently losing net mass to the ocean primarily from West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, which together hold ~5.5 m of sea level rise potential. Yet, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet stores almost ten times more ice, and its evolution contributes significant uncertainty to sea level rise projections, mainly due to insufficient process-scale observations. Here we report the collapse of the Conger–Glenzer Ice Shelf in East Antarctica that culminated with its March 2022 disintegration. We use a combination of observations to document its evolution over four stages spanning 25 years, starting 1997–2000 when small calving events isolated it from the Shackleton Ice Shelf. In 2011, it retreated from a central pinning point, followed by relative calving quiescence for a decade; the remaining ~1,200 km2 of the ice shelf disintegrated over a few days in mid-March 2022. These observations of the Conger–Glenzer Ice Shelf collapse shed light on the processes involved, in particular, the impacts of ocean and atmospheric warming and extreme weather events. Ice shelf collapses, rare in the satellite record so far, have substantial implications for the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet and its contribution to future sea level rise. Satellite observations reveal that the Conger–Glenzer Ice Shelf collapse in East Antarctica occurred in four stages spanning a period of 25 years, culminating in its rapid disintegration in March 2022."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8c66,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文利用卫星图像和机器学习方法，对太平洋环礁上的椰子种植园进行了大规模的制图和分析。研究发现，椰子种植园的面积远远超过了人们之前的认知，对当地植被和生态系统造成了显著的影响。这与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为它使用了卫星遥感技术来获取地表信息，并分析了土地覆盖变化对环境的影响，特别是对植被覆盖和森林砍伐的监测。虽然研究的重点并非大气成分分析，但它揭示了土地利用变化对环境的潜在影响，这些影响可能与大气中的碳循环、水循环等过程相关。因此，这项研究与大气环境遥感技术具有间接的关联性，因为它提供了一种监测和评估土地利用变化的方法，而土地利用变化是影响大气环境的重要因素。,"['vegetation mapping', 'land cover change', 'satellite imagery', 'remote sensing', 'deforestation', 'Pacific atolls', 'coconut plantations']",Michael W Burnett;Rory French;Breonna Jones;Alexander Fischer;Alexandra Holland;Irina Roybal;Timothy White;Sebastian Steibl;Leander D L Anderegg;Hillary Young;Nick D Holmes;Alexander Wegmann,Satellite imagery reveals widespread coconut plantations on Pacific atolls,"Efforts to mitigate tropical deforestation overlook coconut palm (Cocos nucifera L.) plantations on atolls—low island ecosystems that represent the most common landforms in the Pacific basin. Coconut palms have a deep history in the Pacific and were planted extensively over the last two centuries to meet the surging demand for coconut oil exports. But despite wide interest in the global footprint of palm crops, the distribution of coconut palms on Pacific atolls has remained unknown. We applied a supervised machine learning classifier to satellite imagery to produce 2 m resolution vegetation maps of 235 of 266 Pacific atolls. Despite the abandonment of many plantations in recent decades, we find that coconut palms surpass native broadleaf trees in terms of canopy area: coconut presently covers 58.3% of the mapped atolls’ total forested area and 24.1% of their total land area. 51.2% of these coconut canopies occur in monocultures indicative of plantation agriculture and drastic ecological changes. Even among atolls with climates equally suitable for coconut palms, coconut canopy coverage is 32.1 percentage points greater on those that historically exported coconut products, demonstrating the significant and persistent effects of plantations on forest compositions in the tropical Pacific. Coconut palms are most dominant on large, wet islands, reflecting their high rates of water use and thus their potential to deplete critical groundwater resources. The spread of coconut plantations also came at the expense of native vegetation critical for wildlife habitat, nutrient cycling, and soil formation. The severe environmental impacts of coconut plantations urge ecosystem management in a region uniquely exposed to climate change."
10.5194/acp-24-13361-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了2020年国际海事组织实施的硫排放新规对地球能量平衡的影响。新规使国际航运的SO2排放量减少了约80%。由于SO2是气溶胶的前体物，其排放量的减少会减弱气溶胶的有效辐射强迫，从而部分抵消温室气体浓度增加导致的增温效应。研究使用四个全球气候模型和一个化学传输模型计算了SO2排放量减少80%所导致的有效辐射强迫，结果表明其强度与近2到3年CO2浓度增加所导致的有效辐射强迫相当。虽然研究没有量化所有不确定性来源，但强调了航运SO2排放量、硫循环、云反馈以及年际变化等因素的不确定性对结果的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到大气成分分析（SO2和气溶胶），并利用气候模型模拟来评估排放变化对气候的影响。虽然文中没有直接提到具体的卫星或传感器，但研究结果可以与卫星观测数据进行比较和验证，以进一步完善对气溶胶和气候变化的理解。,"['sulfur dioxide (SO2)', 'aerosols', 'effective radiative forcing', 'climate models', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Ragnhild Bieltvedt Skeie;Rachael Byrom;Øivind Hodnebrog;Caroline Jouan;Gunnar Myhre,Multi-model effective radiative forcing of the 2020 sulfur cap for shipping,"In 2020, new regulations by the International Maritime Organization regarding sulfur emissions came into force, reducing emissions of SO2 from the shipping sector by approximately 80 %. In this study, we use multiple models to calculate how much the Earth energy balance changed due to the emission reduction or the so-called effective radiative forcing. The calculated effective radiative forcing is weak, comparable to the effect of the increase in CO2 over the last 2 to 3 years. 
 New regulations of sulfur emissions from shipping were introduced in 2020, reducing emissions of SO2 from international shipping by ∼ 80 %. As SO2 is an aerosol precursor, this drop in emissions over the ocean will weaken the total aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) that has historically masked an uncertain fraction of the warming due to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Here, we use four global climate models and a chemical transport model to calculate the ERF resulting from an 80 % reduction in SO2 emissions from international shipping relative to 2019 emission estimates. The individual model means range from 0.06 to 0.09 W m−2, corresponding to the ERF resulting from the increase in CO2 concentration over the last 2 to 3 years. The full uncertainty in the ERF due to the new regulation is not quantified but will very likely be high considering the contribution of uncertainties in shipping SO2 emissions, the sulfur cycle, the modelling of cloud adjustments and the impact of interannual variability on the method for calculating radiative forcing."

Bender;Thorsten Mauritsen,Constraining net long-term climate feedback from satellite-observed internal variability possible by the mid-2030s,"Our study explores climate feedbacks, vital for understanding global warming. It links them to shifts in Earth's energy balance at the atmosphere's top due to natural temperature variations. It takes roughly 50 years to establish this connection. Combined satellite observations and reanalysis suggest that Earth cools more than expected under carbon dioxide influence. However, continuous satellite data until at least the mid-2030s are crucial for refining our understanding of climate feedbacks. 
 Observing climate feedbacks to long-term global warming, which are crucial climate regulators, is not feasible within the observational record. However, linking them to top-of-the-atmosphere flux variations in response to natural surface temperature fluctuations (internal variability feedbacks) is a viable approach. We explore the use of relating internal variability to forced climate feedbacks in models and applying the resulting relationship to observations to constrain forced climate feedbacks. Our findings reveal strong longwave and shortwave feedback relationships in models during the 14-year overlap with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) record. Yet, due to the weaker relationship between internal variability and forced climate longwave feedbacks, the net feedback relationship remains weak, even over longer periods beyond the CERES record. However, after about half a century, this relationship strengthens, primarily due to reinforcements of the internal variability and forced climate shortwave feedback relationship. We therefore explore merging the satellite records with reanalysis to establish an extended data record. The resulting constraint suggests a stronger negative forced climate net feedback than the model's distribution and an equilibrium climate sensitivity of about 2.59 K  (1.95 to 3.12 K, 5 %–95 % confidence intervals). Nevertheless, this method does not account for certain factors like biogeophysical–chemical feedbacks, inactive on short timescales and not represented in most models, along with differences in historical warming patterns, which may lead to misrepresenting climate sensitivity. Additionally, continuous satellite observations until at least the mid-2030s are essential for using purely observed estimates of the net internal variability feedback to constrain the net forced climate feedback and, consequently, climate sensitivity."

The ducting-induced refractivity bias in the radiosonde climatology and ERA5 data is highly correlated with the height of the PBL. The magnitude of bias is linearly dependent on the strength of ducting but not the location, and the overall reanalysis data systematically underestimate the height of the PBL by as much as 120 m. 
 In this study, high-resolution radiosondes from the Marine Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Global Energy and Water Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud System Study (GCSS) Pacific Cross-section Intercomparison (GPCI) Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) field campaign and ECMWF Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) global reanalysis data are used to assess characteristics of the elevated ducting layer along a transect over the northeastern Pacific Ocean from Los Angeles, California, to Honolulu, Hawaii. The planetary boundary layer (PBL) height (PBLH) increases as the strength of the refractivity gradient decreases westward along the transect. The thickness of the prevailing ducting layer remains remarkably consistent (∼ 110 m) in the radiosonde data. On the other hand, the ERA5 reanalysis generally resolves the ducting features well, but it  underestimates the ducting height and strength, especially over the trade cumulus region near Hawaii. A simple two-step end-to-end simulation is used to evaluate the impact of the elevated ducting layer on radio occultation (RO) refractivity retrievals. A systematic negative refractivity bias (N bias) below the ducting layer is observed throughout the transect, peaking (−5.42 %) slightly below the PBLH and gradually decreasing towards the surface (−0.5 %). The N bias shows a strong positive correlation with the ducting strength. The ERA5 data underestimate the N bias,  with the magnitude of the underestimation increasing westward along the transect."

We want to know why different trends have been observed in the stratosphere. Also, the quality and relevance of tropospheric datasets need to be evaluated. While remaining drifts are still present, our study explains roughly half of the differences in observed trends in previous studies and shows the necessity for continuous review and improvement of the measurements. 
 Long-term, 21st century ground-based ozone measurements are crucial to study the recovery of stratospheric ozone as well as the trends of tropospheric ozone. This study is performed in the context of the LOTUS (Long-term Ozone Trends and Uncertainties in the Stratosphere) and TOAR-II (Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report, phase II) initiatives. Within LOTUS, we want to know why different trends have been observed by different ground-based measurements at Lauder. In TOAR-II, intercomparison studies among the different ground-based datasets are needed to evaluate their quality and relevance for trend studies. To achieve these goals, we perform an intercomparison study of total column ozone and its vertical distribution among the ground-based measurement instruments available at the Lauder station from 2000 to 2022, which are a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, a Dobson spectrophotometer, a UV2 (ultraviolet double monochromator), a microwave radiometer (MWR), ozonesondes, and a stratospheric lidar. Because only the latter two provide high-vertical-resolution profiles, the vertical ozone distribution is validated using partial columns, defined to provide independent information: one tropospheric column and three stratospheric columns. Because FTIR provides total columns and vertical information covering all partial columns as well as high temporal sampling, the intercomparisons (bias, scatter, and drift) are analyzed using FTIR as the reference.Very good agreement between the FTIR and Dobson (FTIR and UV2) total column ozone records is apparent in the high Pearson correlation of 0.97 (0.93), low biases of −3 % (−2 %), and 2 % (3 %) dispersions, which are within the respective systematic and random uncertainties. The small observed drifts 0.4 % (0.3 %)  per decade are “non-significant” (or rather a low certainty in a 95 % confidence interval) and show good stability of the three ozone total column series at Lauder.In the troposphere we find a small bias of −1.9 % with the ozonesondes but a larger one (+10.7 %) with Umkehr, which can be explained by the low degrees of freedom for signal (0.5) of Umkehr in the troposphere. However, no significant drift is found among the three instruments in the troposphere, which proves their relevance for trend studies within TOAR-II. The negative bias observed in total columns is confirmed by negative biases in all stratospheric columns for all instruments with respect to FTIR (between −1.2 % and −6.8 %). This, confirmed by the total column biases, points to a 2 %–3 % underestimation of the infrared spectroscopic line intensities. Nevertheless, the dispersion between FTIR and all techniques is typically within 5 % for the stratospheric partial columns, in close agreement with the given random uncertainty budgets.We observe no significant drift in the stratosphere between ozonesondes and FTIR for all partial columns, with ozonesonde trends being less negative than in LOTUS (Godin-Beekmann et al., 2022, further referred to as the LOTUS22). The only significant drift in the lower-stratospheric columns is obtained between FTIR and Umkehr, as was already found in LOTUS22. Two significant positive drifts are observed in the middle stratosphere (2 % and 3 % per decade) with lidar and MWR, respectively, while two significant negative drifts are observed in the upper stratosphere (−3 % and −4 % per decade) with Umkehr and lidar, respectively. While remaining drifts are still present, our study explains roughly half of the differences in observed trends in LOTUS22 by the different sampling, vertical sensitivity, or time periods and gaps. In addition, the FTIR data in the present work have been improved since LOTUS22, reducing the differences in the upper-stratospheric and tropospheric trends. This shows the necessity for continuous review and improvement of the measurement and retrieval processes. This study also reflects the importance of super sites such as Lauder for cross-validating the long-term ozone measurements. Our study demonstrated that well-harmonized, optimized, well-characterized instruments that show very good agreement in terms of bias, dispersion, and correlation are capable of detecting trends that agree within their respective measurement uncertainties."

A method for cloud motion correction using model winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts is presented and validated using both real measurements and realistic radiative transfer simulations. 
 Cloud geometry and in particular cloud top heights can be derived from 2-D camera measurements by applying a stereographic method to data from an overflight over a scene of clouds (see, e.g., Kölling et al., 2019). Although airplane overpasses are relatively fast, cloud motion with the wind is important and can result in errors in the cloud localization. Here, the impact of the wind is investigated using the method from Kölling et al. (2019) for measurements of the airborne hyperspectral imaging system spectrometer of the Munich Aerosol Cloud Scanner (specMACS). Further, a method for cloud motion correction using model winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is presented. It is shown that the update is important as the original algorithm without the cloud motion correction can over- or underestimate the cloud top heights by several hundred meters, depending on the wind speed and the relative wind direction. This is validated using data from the Elucidating the role of clouds–circulation coupling in climate (EUREC4A) campaign and realistic 3-D radiative transfer simulations. From the comparison of the derived cloud top heights with the expected ones from the model input, an average accuracy of the cloud top heights of less than (20±140) m (mean deviation and 1 standard deviation) is estimated for the updated method."

By integrating the sea ice thickness data into the model, the spring prediction barrier of Arctic sea ice is optimized significantly. The model achieves better prediction skills than the typical numerical model in predicting September’s sea ice concentration seasonally. The sea ice thickness data plays a key role in reducing the prediction errors of the Beaufort Sea, the East Siberian Sea, and the Laptev Sea. 
 The Arctic sea ice is suffering dramatic retreating in summer and fall, which has far-reaching consequences on the global climate and commercial activities. Accurate seasonal sea ice predictions are significant in inferring climate change and planning commercial activities. However, seasonally predicting the summer sea ice encounters a significant obstacle known as the spring predictability barrier (SPB): predictions made later than May demonstrate good skill in predicting summer sea ice, while predictions made on or earlier than May exhibit considerably lower skill. This study develops a transformer-based deep-learning model, SICNetseason (V1.0), to predict the Arctic sea ice concentration on a seasonal scale. Including spring sea ice thickness (SIT) data in the model significantly improves the prediction skill at the SPB point. A 20-year (2000–2019) testing demonstrates that the detrended anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) of Sep. sea ice extent (sea ice concentration > 15 %) predicted by our model at May/Apr. is improved by 7.7 %/10.61 % over the ACC predicted by the state-of-the-art dynamic model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Compared with the anomaly persistence benchmark, the mentioned improvement is 41.02 %/36.33 %. Our deep learning model significantly reduces prediction errors of Sep.'s sea ice concentration on seasonal scales compared to ECMWF and Persistence. The spring SIT data is key in optimizing the SPB, contributing to a more than 20 % ACC enhancement in Sep.'s SIE at four to five months lead predictions. Our model achieves good generalization in predicting the Sep. SIE of 2020–2023."

An estimated 310,000 to 800,000 UOWs exist in the United States (US), whose locations are largely unknown. These wells can potentially leak methane and other volatile organic compounds to the atmosphere, and contaminate groundwater. In this study, we developed a novel framework utilizing a state-of-the-art computer vision neural network model to identify the precise locations of potential UOWs. The U-Net model is trained to detect oil and gas well symbols in georeferenced historical topographic maps, and potential UOWs are identified as symbols that are further than 100 m from any documented well. A custom tool was developed to rapidly validate the potential UOW locations. We applied this framework to four counties in California and Oklahoma, leading to the discovery of 1301 potential UOWs across >40,000 km2. We confirmed the presence of 29 UOWs from satellite images and 15 UOWs from magnetic surveys in the field with a spatial accuracy on the order of 10 m. This framework can be scaled to identify potential UOWs across the US since the historical maps are available for the entire nation."

In this paper, a graph‐based propagation method, referred to as GraphProp, is introduced. This method can accurately obtain LST values which would otherwise have been missing due to cloud cover. To validate this approach, a series of experiments are presented using synthetically obscured Landsat acquisitions. The validation takes place over scenarios ranging from between 10% and 90% cloud cover across six urban locations. In presented experiments, GraphProp recovers missing LST values with a mean absolute error of less than 1.1°C, 1.0°C and 1.8°C in 90% cloud cover scenarios across the studied locations respectively."

While extensive studies have focused on bromine chemistry in polar regions, the bromine species in extrapolar regions, particularly regarding pollution‐related bromine recycling, have received less attention. In this study, we examine the factors influencing the bromine recycling at a clean marine site of the North Atlantic (Cape Verde, CVAO), a semipolluted coastal site of the South China Sea (Hok Tsui, HT), and a polluted continental site of North China (Wangdu, WD), using an observation‐based model combined with updated halogen chemistry. Our results indicate that aerosol‐related multiphase processes significantly affect bromine recycling in these extrapolar sites. Nitrate photodissociation efficiently recycled bromide into the gas phase in regions characterized by strong aerosol acidity (HT) or high aerosol concentrations (WD). Concurrently, bromine species are lost from the gas phase toward aerosol surfaces, with this process being more effective at higher liquid water content (WD > HT > CVAO).

10.1029/2024JD041775,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了印度大陆范围内的热浪频发指数(HWPI)及其时空变化。它提出了一种新的热浪频发指数，该指数综合考虑了热浪的最大强度、平均强度和发生频率三个关键属性，并将其应用于印度大陆，以识别热浪高发区域。研究结果表明，该指数比现有的热浪指数更有效地捕捉了印度不同地区热浪暴露的差异。通过对1951年至2020年的历史数据和2021年至2050年的未来预测数据进行分析，论文确定了印度西部、中部、东北部和西部半岛地区为最易受热浪影响的地区，并预测到本世纪中叶，印度的热浪频发程度将比1981-2010年的基线增加约两倍。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了气候模型和卫星观测数据（虽然文中没有明确说明使用了哪种卫星或传感器）来分析温度数据，并进行时空分析，以识别和预测热浪事件。其结果可用于制定气候变化适应策略。,"['Temperature', 'Heatwaves', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Climate modeling', 'Spatial analysis', 'Time series analysis', 'Climate change impacts', 'Extreme weather events']",Subharthi Sarkar;Rajib Maity,Towards the Development of a Comprehensive Heatwave Proneness Index and Identification of Hotspots Across Indian Mainland,"Heatwaves (HWs) are one of the key‐emerging climatic hazards, with increasing duration, severity, and frequency all over the globe. Identifying HW‐prone regions and their evolving patterns is therefore essential for effective climate adaptation. To address this, we introduce the “Heat‐Wave Proneness Index (HWPI),” a novel metric to identify the key‐exposed regions or hotspots by integrating three key HW attributes—(a) the maximum annual HW magnitude, (b) the mean HW magnitude excluding the maximum (MeanX), and (c) the annual frequency (Frq) of HW events. By applying HWPI across the Indian mainland, we demonstrate its superiority to capture diverse regional variations in HW‐exposure more effectively than one of the widely‐used HW‐indices—Heat‐Wave Magnitude Index daily (HWMId). Further to validate the reliability of the proposed index, top 10 HW‐affected years are identified across India since 1951, out of which four are found from the recent past decade (2010–2019) itself. A comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis is also conducted using the proposed HWPI, over the historical (1951–2020) and future (2021–2050) periods, which reveals the western, central, north‐eastern and western peninsular India to be the most HW‐prone regions in the country. India as a whole will experience approx. two‐fold increase in HW‐ proneness toward mid‐century relative to the 1981–2010 baseline, as depicted from the multi‐model multi‐scenario analysis. Overall, we expect the newly proposed HWPI and visual identification of the future‐projected HW‐prone regions will not only be useful to the scientific community but also for the policymakers to build climate‐informed decisions sufficiently in advance."

 New particle formation (NPF) in the tropical upper troposphere is a globally important source of atmospheric aerosols1–4. It is known to occur over the Amazon basin, but the nucleation mechanism and chemical precursors have yet to be identified2. Here we present comprehensive in situ aircraft measurements showing that extremely low-volatile oxidation products of isoprene, particularly certain organonitrates, drive NPF in the Amazonian upper troposphere. The organonitrates originate from OH-initiated oxidation of isoprene from forest emissions in the presence of nitrogen oxides from lightning. Nucleation bursts start about 2 h after sunrise in the outflow of nocturnal deep convection, producing high aerosol concentrations of more than 50,000 particles cm−3. We report measurements of characteristic diurnal cycles of precursor gases and particles. Our observations show that the interplay between biogenic isoprene, deep tropical convection with associated lightning, oxidation photochemistry and the low ambient temperature uniquely promotes NPF. The particles grow over time, undergo long-range transport and descend through subsidence to the lower troposphere, in which they can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that influence the Earth’s hydrological cycle, radiation budget and climate1,4–8.

 Aircraft observations have revealed ubiquitous new particle formation in the tropical upper troposphere over the Amazon1,2 and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans3,4. Although the vapours involved remain unknown, recent satellite observations have revealed surprisingly high night-time isoprene mixing ratios of up to 1 part per billion by volume (ppbv) in the tropical upper troposphere5. Here, in experiments performed with the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber, we report new particle formation initiated by the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with isoprene at upper-tropospheric temperatures of −30 °C and −50 °C. We find that isoprene-oxygenated organic molecules (IP-OOM) nucleate at concentrations found in the upper troposphere, without requiring any more vapours. Moreover, the nucleation rates are enhanced 100-fold by extremely low concentrations of sulfuric acid or iodine oxoacids above 105 cm−3, reaching rates around 30 cm−3 s−1 at acid concentrations of 106 cm−3. Our measurements show that nucleation involves sequential addition of IP-OOM, together with zero or one acid molecule in the embryonic molecular clusters. IP-OOM also drive rapid particle growth at 3–60 nm h−1. We find that rapid nucleation and growth rates persist in the presence of NOx at upper-tropospheric concentrations from lightning. Our laboratory measurements show that isoprene emitted by rainforests may drive rapid new particle formation in extensive regions of the tropical upper troposphere1,2, resulting in tens of thousands of particles per cubic centimetre.

 In lakes, phytoplankton sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and store it in the form of biomass organic carbon (OC); however, only a small fraction of the OC remains buried, while the remaining part is recycled to the atmosphere as CO2 and methane (CH4). This has the potential effect of adding CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq) to the atmosphere and producing a warming effect due to the higher radiative forcing of CH4 relative to CO2. Here we show a 3.1-fold increase in CO2-eq emissions over a 100-year horizon, with the effect increasing with global warming intensity. Climate warming has stimulated phytoplankton growth in many lakes worldwide, which, in turn, can feed back CO2-eq and create a positive feedback loop between them. In lakes where phytoplankton is negatively impacted by climate warming, the CO2-eq feedback capacity may diminish gradually with the ongoing climate warming.

 We analyze, in this study, for the first time, multi-source data - high-quality ground-based observations (Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)) and satellite (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)) data in combination with two high resolution model (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications-2 (MERRA-2) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)) outputs, and examine the changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD) across the globe during Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) lockdown (2020) period. Statistical significance of the change in aerosol characteristics (AOD and species AODs) from normal (2017–2019 mean) to COVID (2020) period is calculated by two-tailed Student's t-test. AERONET AODs decreased by 20–40% during peak lockdown period in spring and summer of 2020 in most locations across the globe, and these changes are statistically significant. The observed magnitude of changes (increase/decrease) are consistent between AERONET and MODIS. Both global models (MERRA-2 and CAMS) capture well, observed AOD changes. OMI absorbing aerosol index captures increases in carbonaceous aerosols due to wildfires and dust. Global analysis reveals that changes in total AOD and species AODs are highest, and statistically significant during spring over Middle East, South and East Asia. Among all regions, change in dust AOD is maximum over South Asia during spring (>75%; −0.04 decrease in dust AOD in −0.05 change in total AOD) which is statistically significant. Black carbon (BC) and sea salt contribute ≤10% to AOD across the globe. Decrease in BC AOD is maximum over South Asia (50%) during spring 2020 providing a direct evidence for the impact of applied restrictions on anthropogenic activities. Decrease in AOD over North America, Europe, Russia, Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, and South East Asia led to global decrease in AOD. This quantitative documentation of changes in AODs due to reduction in aerosol components/species, their regional and seasonal variations are crucial in planning and supporting future mitigation efforts."

Increases are seen between the two decadal averages, for 2001–2010 and 2011–2019, in western India, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). IGP region, including Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, shows the highest increases in AOD (+0.03, 13%) and PM2.5, s (+8 µg m−3). Seasonal AOD patterns fluctuate, with the IGP experiencing the highest wintertime increase, especially in Bihar (+0.07). In summer, there are increases in AOD along the southern and eastern coastal areas. Monsoons cause a slight rise in AOD, except in Rajasthan. In the post-monsoon season, the IGP experiences a notable increase in AOD (+0.057, 25%), potentially driven by biomass burning in Bihar (+0.11) and Uttar Pradesh (+0.075). Dividing our study area into urban and peri-urban clusters (n = 2791), AOD is found to be similar, possibly due to advective mixing. However, the differences between urban and rural areas become more noticeable, especially in the second decade. Correlations between AOD and PM2.5, g vary across locations, with the highest found in Kanpur (R2 = 0.61) and weaker in Delhi (R2 = 0.42), highlighting the need for more ground monitoring.

We assess the effect of dust on the Indian and east Asian summer monsoons through multi-model experiments isolating the effect of dust in current climate models for the first time. Dust atmospheric heating results in a southward shift of western Pacific equatorial rainfall and an enhanced Indian summer monsoon. This shows the importance of accurate dust representation in models. 
 We investigate the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) response to global dust emissions in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, which is the first CMIP to include an experiment with a doubling of global dust emissions relative to their preindustrial levels. Thus, for the first time, the inbuilt influence of dust on climate across a range of climate models being used to evaluate and predict Earth's climate can be quantified. We find that dust emissions cause a strong atmospheric heating over Asia that leads to a pronounced energy imbalance. This results in an enhanced Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and a southward shift of the western Pacific Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), consistent across models, with the strength of the ISM enhancement increasing with the magnitude of atmospheric dust shortwave absorption, driven by dust optical depth changes. However, the east Asian summer monsoon response shows large uncertainties across models, arising from the diversity in models' simulated dust emissions and in the dynamical response to these changes. Our results demonstrate the central role of dust absorption in influencing the ASM and the importance of accurate dust simulations for constraining the ASM and the ITCZ in climate models."

This ability is controlled by the number of cloud droplets, which is governed by the number of aerosol particles in the atmosphere, laying the foundation for so-called aerosol–cloud–climate interactions. In this study, a simple model to understand the effect of aerosol on cloud water is developed and applied. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions modulate the role of clouds in Earth's climate. We derive, evaluate, and apply a simple model to understand aerosol-mediated cloud water adjustments in stratocumulus based on only two prognostic equations for the integrated cloud water L and droplet number concentration N. The model is solved numerically and analytically and agrees well with documented large-eddy-simulation data and satellite retrievals. A tight relationship between adjustments at low and high N is found, revealing the influence of non-precipitation processes (primarily entrainment) on adjustments in precipitating clouds. Furthermore, it is shown that adjustments in non-precipitating clouds tend to be positively biased by external L or N perturbations, while adjustments in precipitating clouds are barely susceptible. By deliberately reducing the complexity of the underlying system, this study constitutes a way forward to facilitate process-level understanding of cloud water adjustments."

This study investigated the viability of an optical scatter monitor system, featuring two nephelometric monitors (pDR-1500), to determine κOA after knowing the aerosol chemical composition. This system was operated during a mobile lab deployment on Long Island in the summer of 2023, which was executed to coordinate with the Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) field campaign. The derived κOA under subsaturated high-humidity conditions (RH between 85 % and 95 %) were categorized based on different aerosol sources, including wildfire aerosol, urban aerosol, and aerosol from rural conditions. The κOA and the OA
O:C ratio exhibited linear positive relationships for the urban aerosol and the aerosol from rural conditions, with a much higher slope (0.50 vs. 0.24) for the latter.

10.5194/amt-17-6865-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了利用化学电离质谱法(CIMS)检测大气中两种有毒异构体：异氰酸甲酯(MIC)和羟基乙腈(HAN)的灵敏度。研究发现，在常用的CIMS仪器工作条件下，对MIC的检测灵敏度非常低，而对HAN的灵敏度很高。这表明之前一些利用CIMS进行大气测量研究中，将C2H3NO信号误认为是MIC的情况很可能实际上是检测到了HAN。该研究强调了在鉴定和定量异构体化合物时使用绝对校准标准的重要性，这对改进大气成分分析和空气质量监测至关重要，特别是对于痕量气体的检测。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS)', 'Isomer identification', 'Trace gas detection', 'Field measurements']",Zachary Finewax;Aparajeo Chattopadhyay;J.

The results from this work have demonstrated that the hydroyacetonitrile isomer was observed in previous field studies rather than the stated identification of methyl isocyanate. 
 The toxic reduced nitrogen compound methyl isocyanate (CH3NCO, MIC) has been reported as present in wildfire and biomass burning emissions, agricultural fumigation plumes, and indoor air. Its isomer, hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH2CN, glycolonitrile, or HAN) has not been observed in the Earth's atmosphere to date. In this study, absolute sensitivity calibrations for these isomers using two I− chemical ionization mass spectrometry (I-CIMS) instruments, the time-of-flight (ToF) and quadrupole (Quad) instruments, commonly used in laboratory and field measurements, were performed, for the first time, over a range of ion-molecule reactor temperatures (10–40 °C) and I(H2O)− / I− ratio (0.01–1). This study demonstrates that I-CIMS, under typical operating conditions, is not sensitive to MIC with limits of detection (LOD) of > 860 and > 570 ppb for the ToF and Quad I-CIMS instruments, respectively. Both I-CIMS instruments are, however, highly sensitive to the HAN isomer with 0.3 and 3 ppt LODs for the ToF-CIMS and Quad-CIMS instruments, respectively. The present results show that several recent field studies using I-CIMS instrument detection have misattributed the C2H3NO signal to MIC. This study proposes that HAN rather than MIC was most likely the C2H3NO isomer observed in those field studies, although the source chemistry for HAN remains uncharacterized. This study demonstrates the importance of applying absolute calibration standards in the identification and quantification of isomeric compounds."

However, the intrinsic enhancing potential (IEP) of various amines remains largely unknown, restraining the assessment on the role of the SA-amines mechanism at various locations. Herein, machine learning (ML) models were constructed for high-throughput prediction of IEP of amines, and the nucleation mechanism of specific amines with high IEP was investigated. The formation free energy (ΔG) of SA-amines dimer clusters, a key parameter for assessing IEP, was calculated for 58 amines. Based on the calculated ΔG values, seven ML models were constructed and the best one was further utilized to predict the ΔG values of the remaining 153 amines. Diethylamine (DEA), mainly emitted from ethanol gasoline vehicles, was found to be one of the amines with the highest IEP for SA-driven nucleation. By studying larger SA-DEA clusters, it was found that the nucleation rate of DEA with SA is 3–7 times higher than that of dimethylamine, a well-known key base for SA-driven nucleation. The study provides a powerful tool for evaluating the actual role of amines on SA-driven nucleation and revealed that the mechanism could be particularly important in areas where ethanol gasoline vehicles are widely used."

However, the interactive and joint associations of multiple exposures on ACS onset remain unknown. A time-stratified case-crossover study was conducted including 1,292,219 ACS patients who were selected from 1,895 districts/counties across China during 2015–2020. The ACS conditions included ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina (UA). Conditional logistic regression models were applied to estimate the interactive and joint associations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and temperature (TM) with the ACS onset. The ACS onset risks increased by 0.38% for each 10 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 concentration, and an inverse U-shaped curve of TM and risk of ACS onset was observed. The associations of PM2.5 with the ACS onset were greater on colder days. The jointly attributable fractions (AF) of PM2.5 and nonoptimal TM was 9.93% in all ACS patients, 10.31% in females, 12.91% in patients aged ≥65 years, 17.54% in NSTEMI patients, and 12.43% in Southern China. This study suggested that joint short-term exposures to ambient PM2.5 and moderate cold TM may substantially increase the onset of ACS. Furthermore, there are synergistic interactions among higher PM2.5 and lower TM peaks on the ACS onset."

Herein, a unique AsOx/CeO2 interface is constructed to transform arsenic from poison into active site with balanced acid-redox property, successfully achieving efficient NOx removal. The optimized AsOx/CeO2 exhibits high NOx removal efficiency, four times that of the As-poisoned V2O5/TiO2 catalyst, and even comparable to the state-of-the-art SCR catalysts. It was found that the As–O–Ce interfacial sites in oxygen-bridged As dimers on CeO2 can provide both Lewis acid sites and active lattice oxygen species, enhancing the adsorption and activation of NH3 to form key –NH2 intermediates, thereby facilitating the NH3–SCR reaction. More surprisingly, a thin CeO2 layer on the top of V2O5/TiO2 can capture arsenic to protect catalysts from arsenic attacking, which improves the catalytic activity to 2.8 × 10–7 mol g–1 s–1, even higher than that of fresh V2O5/TiO2 (2.0 × 10–7 mol g–1 s–1). Therefore, this strategy provides new ideas not only for designing antipoisoning SCR catalysts but also a feasible solution for the stable operation of commercial SCR catalysts in arsenic-containing flue gas."

This study investigates the diurnal cycle and its seasonal differences in global precipitation using hierarchical clustering and high‐resolution satellite precipitation data.

Atmospheric controls on the maximum depth reached by moist convection are investigated with radar‐tracked convective cells tagged with sounding‐derived atmospheric parameters from a field campaign in central Argentina. Regression analyses show that narrow (<12‐km diameter) and wide (>16‐km diameter) cell depths respond to disparate factors, where cell areas are defined using composite reflectivity signatures. Undiluted lifted parcel indices including convective available potential energy (CAPE) and level of neutral buoyancy (LNB) are top predictors of wide cell maximum depth while mid‐tropospheric relative humidity is the top predictor of narrow cell maximum depth. Because narrow cells are more numerous than wide cells, the overall outcome of the full cell population does not strongly correlate with CAPE and LNB conditions. Tracked cells and atmospheric conditions in a simulation with 3‐km grid spacing covering the field campaign produce similar results to those observed. Narrow cells that are relatively deep have a cooler and moister mid‐troposphere with weaker free tropospheric subsidence, while relatively deep wide cells have much warmer and moister lower tropospheric conditions. These atmospheric differences are present 1 hr before cell initiation at both a fixed observing site and variable cell initiation locations. Simulated narrow cell maximum equivalent potential temperature decreases with height at a rate similar to the ambient vertical gradient, causing these cells to fall short of their LNB and supporting the view that entrainment‐driven dilution is a dominant control on their depth."

 Widespread spring vegetation greening (inferred by LAI) in the Northern Hemisphere leads to additional summer soil moisture (SM) deficits through increasing transpiration. Meanwhile, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) has also been rising, which can increase atmospheric evaporative demand. However, the extent and magnitude of influence of these two factors on SM changes have not been elucidated. Here, based on the state-of-the-art reanalysis and remote sensing data, we use three statistical methods to quantify the contributions of spring LAI and summer VPD to summer SM deficit. The results show that summer VPD contributes more to SM change than spring LAI in the southwestern and northern regions of North America, northeastern Europe, and central and southeastern Asia, covering 13.4% of the vegetated areas despite of the certain influence of spring vegetation greening on summer soil drying.

 Land use is key in regulating surface temperature, yet these relationships are often obscured by long-term mean responses. Here we employed numerical multi-model results to investigate the response of the surface temperature to land use change, especially its lower tails corresponding to boreal winter. The surface temperature decrease in the lower tails can exhibit up to ten times greater than the mean response to land use change over both the historical and future periods. Downward longwave radiation has emerged as the most remarkable contributing factor in controlling surface temperature change in mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Land use change can modify surface energy balance through land-atmosphere firstly, thereby regulate spatial patterns of water vapor and cloud cover in the Northern Hemisphere through teleconnection. The unity of local and remote effects influences the levels of downward longwave radiation and altering surface temperature at mid-high latitudes in extreme cold seasons.

 Understanding terrestrial vegetation phenology—the timing of life-cycle events—is crucial for insights into ecosystem energy and material cycles. Land surface phenology (LSP) derived from satellite observations has become a critical tool for tracking vegetation phenology across large spatial scales. However, LSP data from coarse spatial resolutions often mix phenological signals from multiple land cover types, a limitation that fine-resolution satellite data can help overcome. Recent studies indicate that spring phenology derived from the 500-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data tends to be biased earlier than that from the 30-m Landsat data due to scale effects. The extent of this bias across other satellite sensors and its impact on long-term phenological trends remains unclear. Additionally, few studies have used medium- to high-resolution LSP data to investigate southwestern China, partly due to limited data availability, which may exacerbate uncertainties related to scale effects in LSP observations. To address these gaps, we selected Jinfo Mountain in southwestern China—a region with high spatial heterogeneity—to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of spring phenology and examine associated scale effects and uncertainties. We applied two phenology retrieval methods to multi-resolution LSP data from various sensors: 30-m Landsat (1984–2023), 250-m MODIS (2002–2021), 500-m MODIS (2000–2023), 1-km SPOT (1999–2019), and 8-km AVHRR (1982–2022). Our findings revealed that all sensors consistently captured the spatial patterns of spring phenology, indicating an advancing trend of 6–8 days per decade, though the trend’s magnitude varied notably across sensors. Data quality, rather than retrieval methods, emerged as the primary source of uncertainty in characterizing phenological dynamics, with elevation contributing significantly to bias due to its negative correlation with the number of available clear observations. Moreover, we found that the MODIS-Landsat bias in spring phenology may not generalize across other coarse-to-fine LSP comparisons. This study provides valuable insights into phenology in the understudied region of southwestern China, highlighting the importance of spatial resolution and sensor characteristics for accurate plant phenology mapping and monitoring."

 Increasing heavy rainfall poses significant challenges in the Yangtze-Huaihe River Valley (YHRV). There is a need for more specific insights into the vertical microphysical structures and their influence on heavy rainfall to enhance the accuracy of numerical simulations and forecasts. Using data from the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite from 2014 to 2023, this study investigated the vertical microphysical structures of different types of heavy summer rainfall (> 8 mm/h) and elucidated their impacts on the rain rate in the YHRV. Based on the radar reflectivity thresholds at different altitudes, heavy summer rainfall was classified into four types: deep convective, shallow convective, stratiform rainfall, and warm rainfall. In the YHRV region, shallow convective rainfall contributed the most to total heavy rainfall (39.1 %) and had the highest occurrence (44.7 %) of extreme rainfall (>50 mm/h). Stratiform rainfall occurred most frequently but decreased rapidly with increasing rain rates, while warm rainfall contributed little to heavy rainfall. For the vertical microphysical structure of heavy rainfall, deep convective rainfall exhibited rapid growth of large particles above the melting layer, resulting in the largest average mass-weighted diameter (Dm) near the surface (2.2 mm), but the smallest average droplet concentration (recorded as dBNw in the decibel scale), approximately 37. Below the melting layer, the Dm of small particles in the shallow convective rainfall increased rapidly, and the impact of coalescence was much greater than that of break-up. Except for warm rainfall, the average Dm for other types of heavy rainfall remained relatively high, exceeding 1.5 mm both within and below the melting layer. The average dBNw increased consistently as altitude decreased. As rainfall intensified to extreme rainfall, the average rain rate of shallow convective rainfall slightly surpassed that of deep convective rainfall. This was due to a decrease in average dBNw for deep convective rainfall, while the average dBNw of shallow convective rainfall continued to increase."

Here we investigated the relationship between weather regimes (WRs) and fire weather indices, specifically vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index. By identifying five singular WRs using k-means clustering, we found that a particular regime (WR-2), one characterized by a distinct tripolar wave train pattern over the continental U.S., has exhibited an increased frequency since 1980. The ascribed WR-2 regime was found to be mainly responsible for rising trends in the fire weather indices, especially VPD. Further, the average fire indices of the WR-2 regime played a more important role than the frequency in shaping the rising trends in the fire weather indices. The increased frequency of the WR-2 WR was mainly attributed to anthropogenic forcing and, the year-to-year variation of the frequency was associated with sea surface temperature anomalies over the subtropical eastern Pacific. Human-induced climate change might have furthered the exacerbation of wildfire danger in the western U.S. by modulating the behaviors of WRs and fire weather indices."

Clarifying these interactions, if any, is crucial due to the omnipresence of PM2.5 in the atmosphere and increasing scope and frequency of extreme temperature events. To investigate both of these interactions, we merged 6 073 575 individual-level mortality records from thirteen states spanning seventeen years with 1 km daily PM2.5 predictions from sophisticated prediction model and 1 km meteorology from Daymet V4. A time-stratified, bidirectional case-crossover design was used to control for confounding by individual-level, long-term and cyclic weekly characteristics. We fitted conditional logistic regressions with an interaction term between PM2.5 and extreme temperature events to investigate the potential interactive effects on mortality. Ambient PM2.5 exposure has the greatest effect on mortality by all internal causes in the 2 d moving average exposure window. Additionally, we found consistently synergistic interactions between a 10 μg m−3 increase in the 2 d moving average of PM2.5 and extreme heat with interaction odds ratios of 1.013 (95% CI: 1.000, 1.026), 1.024 (95% CI: 1.002, 1.046), and 1.033 (95% CI: 0.991, 1.077) for deaths by all internal causes, circulatory causes, and respiratory causes, respectively, which represent 75%, 156%, and 214% increases in the coefficient estimates for PM2.5 on those days. We also found evidence of interactions on the additive scale with corresponding relative excess risks due to interaction (RERIs) of 0.013 (95% CI: 0.003, 0.021), 0.020 (95% CI: 0.008, 0.031), and 0.017 (95% CI: −0.015, 0.036). Interactions with other PM2.5 exposure windows were more pronounced. For extreme cold, our results were suggestive of an antagonistic relationship. These results suggest that ambient PM2.5 interacts synergistically with exposure to extreme heat, yielding greater risks for mortality than only either exposure alone."

Chou,"On the atmospheric budget of 1,2-dichloroethane and its impact on stratospheric chlorine and ozone (2002–2020)","DCE (1,2-dichloroethane) is an industrial chemical used to produce PVC (polyvinyl chloride). We analysed DCE production data to estimate global DCE emissions (2002–2020). The emissions were included in an atmospheric model and evaluated by comparing simulated DCE to DCE measurements in the troposphere. We show that DCE contributes ozone-depleting Cl to the stratosphere and that this has increased with increasing DCE emissions. DCE’s impact on stratospheric O3 is currently small but non-zero. 
 The chemical compound 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), or ethylene dichloride, is an industrial very short-lived substance (VSLS) whose major use is as a feedstock in the production chain of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Like other chlorinated VSLSs, transport of DCE (and/or its atmospheric oxidation products) to the stratosphere could contribute to ozone depletion there. However, despite annual production volumes greatly exceeding those of more prominent VSLSs (e.g. dichloromethane), global DCE observations are sparse; thus, the magnitude and distribution of DCE emissions and trends in its atmospheric abundance are poorly known. In this study, we performed an exploratory analysis of the global DCE budget between 2002 and 2020. Combining bottom-up data on annual production and assumptions around fugitive losses during production and feedstock use, we assessed the DCE source strength required to reproduce atmospheric DCE observations. We show that the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT 3-D chemical transport model (CTM) reproduces DCE measurements from various aircraft missions well, including HIPPO (2009–2011), ATom (2016–2018), and KORUS-AQ (2016), along with surface measurements from Southeast Asia, when assuming a regionally varying production emission factor in the range of 0.5 %–1.5 %. Our findings imply substantial fugitive losses of DCE and/or substantial emissive applications (e.g. solvent use) that are poorly reported. We estimate that DCE's global source increased by ∼ 45 % between 2002 (349 ± 61 Gg yr−1) and 2020 (505 ± 90 Gg yr−1), with its contribution to stratospheric chlorine increasing from 8.2 (± 1.5) to ∼ 12.9 (± 2.4) ppt Cl (where ppt denotes parts per trillion) over this period. DCE's relatively short overall tropospheric lifetime (∼ 83 d) limits, although does not preclude, its transport to the stratosphere, and we show that its impact on ozone is small at present. Annually averaged, DCE is estimated to have decreased ozone in the lower stratosphere by up to several parts per billion (< 1 %) in 2020, although a larger effect in the springtime Southern Hemisphere polar lower stratosphere is apparent (decreases of up to ∼ 1.3 %). Given strong potential for growth in DCE production tied to demand for PVC, ongoing measurements would be of benefit to monitor potential future increases in its atmospheric abundance and its contribution to ozone depletion."

Courtier;Alessandro Battaglia;Kamil Mroz,Advantages of G-band radar in multi-frequency liquid-phase microphysical retrievals,"A new millimetre-wavelength radar is used to improve methods of retrieving information about the smallest droplets that exist within clouds. The radar is shown to be able to retrieve the vertical wind speed more accurately and more frequently and to retrieve the cloud properties for clouds with lower rainfall rates and smaller droplets than would be possible using longer-wavelength radars. 
 Radar-based microphysical retrievals of cloud and droplet properties are vital for informing model parameterisations of clouds and precipitation, but these retrievals often do not capture the details of small droplets in light rain or drizzle. A state-of-the-art G-band radar is used here to demonstrate improvements to microphysical retrievals in a case study featuring light rain. Compared to W-band radar, improvements are seen in the retrieval of vertical wind speed due to the location of Mie minima at smaller droplet sizes with the G-band radar. This, in turn, has an impact on the retrieval of the drop size distribution, allowing for better accuracy in the retrieval of the characteristic drop diameter and for improvements in the retrieval of the particle number concentrations of small droplet sizes. The dual-Doppler velocity (DDV) between the Ka- and G-bands shows increased dynamic range compared to the Ka–W pairing, particularly for instances presenting small characteristic drop diameters. The increased attenuation experienced at G-band enables improved retrievals of liquid water content and precipitation rate when paired with W-band or Ka-band compared to the W-band and Ka-band pairing. This is particularly noticeable in periods of light rain when the W-band and Ka-band radars receive negligible attenuation, while the attenuation at G-band is much greater."

Understanding and resolving these differences are critical for future analyses linking satellite, ground-based remote sensing, and in situ observations in air quality monitoring. It shows that the meteorological conditions (wind directions, speed, and boundary layer conditions) will strongly affect the agreement between the two measurements. 
 Ground-based remote sensing instruments have been widely used for atmospheric research,  but applications for air quality monitoring remain limited. Compared to an in situ instrument that provides air quality conditions at the ground level, most remote sensing instruments (nadir viewing) are sensitive to a broad range of altitudes, often providing only integrated column observations. These column data can be more difficult to interpret and to relate to surface values and hence to “nose-height-level” health factors. This research utilized ground-based remote sensing and in situ air quality observations in Canada's Athabasca oil sands region to investigate some of their differences.Vertical column densities (VCDs) of SO2 and NO2 retrieved by Pandora spectrometers located at the Oski-Otin site at Fort McKay (Alberta, Canada) from 2013–2019 were analyzed along with measurements of SO2 and NO2 surface concentrations and meteorological data. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations by a CIMEL sunphotometer were compared with surface PM2.5 data. The Oski-Otin site is surrounded by several large bitumen mining operations within the Athabasca oil sands region with significant NO2 emissions from the mining fleet. Two major bitumen upgraders that are 20 km south-east of the site have total SO2 and NO2 emissions of about 40 and 20 kt yr−1, respectively. It was demonstrated that remote sensing data from Pandora and CIMEL combined with high-vertical-resolution wind profiles can provide information about pollution sources and plume characteristics. Elevated SO2 VCDs were clearly observed for times with south and south-eastern winds, particularly at 200–300 m altitude (above ground level). High NO2 VCD values were observed from other directions (e.g., north-west) with less prominent impacts from 200–300 m winds. In situ ground observations of SO2 and NO2 show a different sensitivity to  wind profiles, indicating they are less sensitive to elevated plumes than remote sensing instruments. In addition to measured wind data and lidar-observed boundary layer height (BLH), modelled wind profiles and BLH from ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) have been used to further examine the correlation between column and surface observations. The results show that the height of emission sources (e.g., emissions from high stacks or near the surface) will determine the ratio of measured column and surface concentration values (i.e., could show positive or negative correlation with BLH). This effect will have an impact on the comparison between column observations (e.g., from the satellite or ground-based remote sensing instruments) with surface in situ measurements.This study explores differences between remote sensing and in situ instruments in terms of their vertical, horizontal, and temporal sampling differences. Understanding and resolving these differences are critical for future analyses linking satellite, ground-based remote sensing and in situ observations in air quality monitoring and research."

Our work developed the models by the hybrid scheme that integrates machine learning and spatial kriging for reconstructing the product of all-sky hourly estimates of surface air temperature for global land areas. The models for the product were fully validated and analyzed. The scheme for generating the product has the general practicability of applications. 
 Spatially continuous surface air temperature (SAT) is critically important for a wide range of fields such as eco-environmental assessments and hydrology. Remotely sensed estimation models based on satellite-derived thermal infrared data provides a structurally different approach for reconstructing SAT compared to spatial interpolation of ground observations of SAT and numerical modelling, which are mainly limited by the coverage of stations and coarse spatial resolutions, respectively. However, the data products of remotely sensed estimates of SAT developed in previous studies are only available at daily or monthly resolutions, and are primarily restricted for local regions. In this study, we generated the first hourly dataset (GHRSAT) of all-sky remotely sensed SAT estimates for the global land areas except Antarctica between 2011 and 2023. The hourly estimates in GHRSAT were reconstructed from land surface temperature using the hybrid estimation models that integrate random forest (RK) models and kriging techniques. The hybrid models were developed for different regions on a monthly basis. We adopted ordinary kriging (OK) and fixed rank kriging (FRK) in the modelling of the site residuals from the RF models for regions with low-density and high-density stations, respectively. Our results show that the hybrid models for generating GHRSAT have the predictive performance between 1.48 °C to 2.28 °C in overall cross-validation RMSE. The mean RMSE for estimating hourly SAT can be significantly reduced by 0.18–0.41 °C by the hybrid models compared to the RF models. We analyzed the variability in the predictive errors of estimating hourly SAT across regions, months and sites. The variability is apparently decreased when using the hybrid models. We found that the RF models are less sensitive to the parameter tuning of the RF models, which greatly impacts the hybrid models. Improving the RF models by parameter tuning can drastically improve the hybrid models based on the RF models. Additionally, we found the performance difference between OK and FRK in developing the hybrid models for regions with large amounts of stations is slight with the mean RMSE of 0.05 °C. In summary, the scheme of the hybrid models can result in satisfactorily higher performance for estimating SAT, and has the general practicability of applying to regions at various scales. The GHRSAT dataset is publicly available at http://doi.org/10.11888/RemoteSen.tpdc.301540 (Zhang, 2024)."

In this study, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was chosen as a proxy for marine surfactants to investigate its impact on aqueous nitrate photolysis for the first time. Remarkable increases in HONO and NO2 production rates by factors of 3.3 and 5.6, respectively, along with a 1.9-fold rise in NO2– concentration, were observed at a very low SDS concentration of 0.01 mM, strongly illustrating the promoting effect on nitrate photolysis. Furthermore, at an SDS concentration of 2 mM, intriguingly aligned with the critical micelle concentration, there was an additional 41.7% increase in HONO production rates. Vertically resolved Raman measurements indicated that SDS anions at the aqueous-air interface attracted NO3– closer to the aqueous surfaces, increasing the amount of incompletely solvated surface nitrate. Importantly, the anionic surfactant exhibited a greater promoting effect on HONO production compared to other typical nitrate photochemistry systems with the addition of a marine dissolved organic matter proxy, halogen, photosensitizer, or OH scavenger. These findings offer new insights into marine-derived HONO sources and should be considered in model simulations concerning the budgets of NOx, OH, and O3."

The yields of the products formed were measured with authentic and surrogate standards. This approach quantified >97% of the products for both reactions under investigation. For the first time, the formation of 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA) and other terpenoic acids (TAs) from the aqueous OH reaction with PND was confirmed with authentic standards. Based on the data acquired, mechanisms of OH oxidation of PND and CND were proposed. The yields of aqSOAs were evaluated by combining kinetic and air–water partitioning models developed for the the precursors, PND and CND, and for the first-generation products: cis-pinonic and camphoric acids. Modeled yields of aqSOAs ranged from 0.05 to 2.5. At liquid water content (LWC) from 1 × 10–4 to 4 × 10–3 (g × m–3, haze, and fogs), oxidized TAs were the major components of aqSOAs. In clouds with LWC > 0.06 (g × m–3), the contribution of nonacidic products to the mass of aqSOAs became dominant.

The heterogeneous reactions of NO2 on surfaces and photolysis of particulate nitrate or adsorbed nitric acid are important sources of atmospheric HONO, yet the corresponding kinetic parameters based on laboratory investigations and field observations exhibit considerable variations. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning model to analyze the HONO budget using two years of summer urban supersite observations. By integrating chemical mechanisms and feature engineering into our machine learning model, we assessed the contributions of different sources to HONO and inferred the kinetic parameters for the primary HONO formation pathways, thereby partially addressing the limitations associated with predetermined rate coefficients. Our findings revealed that the primary source of daytime HONO in the summer was the photolysis of nitric acid adsorbed on both aerosol and ground surfaces, accounting for over 40% of its unknown sources. This was followed by the photoenhanced heterogeneous conversion of NO2 and the photolysis of particulate nitrate.

Smoke composition, aerosol liquid water content, effective density (ρeff), and other properties can change significantly as smoke travels through areas under different ambient conditions and over time. During this study, we measured changes in smoke composition and physical properties due to oxidative aging and exposure to humidity. We found that smoke aging led to SOA formation and increases in ratios of organic carbon to elemental carbon. Aerosol liquid water content increased with increasing relative humidity (RH), and aged smoke took up more water than fresh smoke at all humidity levels, likely due to a combination of changes in aerosol surface polarity at low and medium RH and increases in surface area with aging at high RH. Growth factors ranged from 1.06 ± 0.08 for fresh smoke at low RH to 1.32 ± 0.08 for aged smoke at high RH. Oxidative aging and exposure to humidity led to increases in ρeff. For 100 nm particles, ρeff ranged from ∼1.2 for fresh smoke at low RH to ∼1.6 for aged smoke at high RH.

By leveraging a specific multivariate statistic, we elucidate the vertical microphysical structures of mixed‐phase clouds and their transitions associated with cloud particle growth and phase change. Expanding upon previous warm rain process diagnostics, we integrate cloud thermodynamic phase information from lidar and imager, representing the phase near the cloud top and column, respectively, to classify the vertical microphysical structures obtained from radar. Our global composite analysis reveals a systematic transition from non‐precipitating to precipitating characteristics with increasing ice phase fraction of the cloud column, rather than near the cloud top, and increasing cloud‐top particle size. These findings offer valuable observational references for evaluating numerical models in precipitation physics."

In the Cerrado biome, clearing of native vegetation has led to shortfalls of staple crops due to a delayed agricultural rainy season. 
 Deforestation not only contributes to global warming but also induces changes in the regional climates that impact agriculture. Here, we analyse the effects of deforestation-induced climate change on the soy–maize double cropping of the Cerrado biome. Since the 1980s, there has been an average delay of 36 days in the start of the agricultural rainy season, a 36.7% reduction in total rainfall over the period and a 1.5 °C rise in the temperature in the biome. Of the 8.1 million ha of soy–maize double cropping, 99% experienced delays in the agricultural rainy season and 61% faced reduced rainfall. Those changes have contributed to more frequent and severe soybean and maize crop shortfalls. Delays in the onset of the agricultural rainy season, reductions in rainfall and increases in maximum air temperatures occur more frequently in areas with extensive native vegetation loss. To sustain agricultural productivity in the Cerrado, it is crucial to conserve and restore its native vegetation. Deforestation has the potential to alter regional precipitation cycles.

 Vegetation carbon sequestration is a fundamental process that supports ecosystem biodiversity and ecological services. It is a key factor in shaping ecosystem state and energy flow. Global climate change has intensified in recent years. Frequent drought events affect the stabilization of carbon cycle. In this study, we used correlation analysis method to explore the relationship between standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and gross primary productivity (GPP). Our study found that the global drought degree is decreasing, and drought sensitivity of global surface vegetation decreased. The drought index value increased 91.3% and the sensitivity decreased 35.71% during the 2010–2020 period (P2) compared to the 2000–2010 period (P1). Our study also found that the global area of drought decreased by 4.03% in P2, but the global area with high drought frequency increased by 0.21%. The drought response time scale shortened by 5.19%.

 Mineral aerosols are one of the most important ice nucleating particles (INPs) because their efficiency in nucleating ice, wide transport and largest mass contribution to particulate matter in the atmosphere. They are sourced from the arid regions of the world. In this context, this work evaluates the INP potential of fourteen topsoil samples collected from subtropical South American deserts, the major source of mineral aerosols in South America, in the immersion freezing mode. Samples were obtained from three distinct regions located in the South American Arid Diagonal and recognized as potential dust source areas: the Puna-Altiplano Plateau in the north, the central-west of Argentina, and Patagonia in the south. In general, results reveal that samples from the Puna-Altiplano and Patagonia regions, and the central-west of Argentina region exhibit the highest and lowest INP abilities, respectively. The active sites per unit surface area for a given temperature were calculated and compared with previously reported values. The results demonstrate that soil mineral particles from the region of study exhibit ice nucleating abilities comparable to the inorganic fraction of agricultural soils of central Argentina. No direct relationship was identified between INP ability and the major minerals observed in the samples. This study is the first to analyze the ice nucleation properties of soil samples collected along the South American Arid Diagonal and one of the few in South America. Since the analyzed topsoil particles were collected from potential dust source regions, this work contributes to understanding the role of aerosols in initiating atmospheric ice formation, providing valuable data for empirical parameterizations. This could contribute to the improvement in the performance of climate models, as the obtained results suggest that the underestimation of coarse and super-coarse aerosols at altitudes relevant for cloud formation may lead to underestimations in INP concentrations, particularly in regions near to the emission sources."

 Aerosols hygroscopicity and CCN activity in coastal area is influenced by continental-marine air interaction, probably exerting a profound climate effect. In this study, combining field measurement at a coastal site in Shenzhen with a back trajectory model, we have identified an externally-mixed sea salt mode in accumulated particles, where the hygroscopic parameter (κ) ranges from 0.97 to 1.14. The sea salt mode, however, was not observed for ultrafine particles in nucleation/Aitken modes. Nonetheless, the.hygroscopicity of the particles across all sizes under the influence of marine air were remarkably enhanced by 49 %–64 % compared to the continental air masses. Moreover, we reveal a considerable transport of marine-sourced sulfate aerosols when the marine air dominated, explaining the enhanced hygroscopicity. We attribute the absence of externally-mixed sea salt in nucleation/Aitken modes to that the ultrafine marine-sourced aerosols are generally with lower quantity and tend to be collided and internally-mixed during transport. We finally made a global review using observations at 21 sites, deriving the κ of 0.21–0.25, 0.23–0.32, and 0.51–0.60 categorized by continental, coastal, and oceanic respectively.

 Defining regions with similar characteristics for extreme precipitation is crucial for understanding the impacts of climate change, planning and managing water resources, and designing hydraulic structures. However, studies on the regionalization of extreme precipitation for Türkiye are limited, and regional extreme precipitation characteristics are not well defined. In this study, motivated by the need to contribute to this field, homogenous regions for extreme precipitation across Türkiye were determined using the latest version (V07) of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG). We initially validated IMERG V07 estimates using data from 214 ground-based stations and compared the results with its predecessor V06. The results revealed that IMERG showed some notable improvements from V06 to V07 for all seasons, especially in winter. During this season, the correlation coefficient increased from 0.57 to 0.64, the mean absolute bias decreased from 78.22 % to 69.27 %, and the RMSE decreased from 11.10 mm/day to 9.70 mm/day. In V07, while the trend of decreasing accuracy with increasing elevation observed in V06 continues, it has been shown that some notable improvements were achieved in continuous and categorical metrics. We then applied widely used non-hierarchical (K-means) and hierarchical (Ward's method) clustering techniques. To perform this, we first applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables related to extreme precipitation (e.g. amount, frequency, standard deviation, and seasonality) and geographic characteristics to identify the most significant variables for analysis. The K-means method delineated Türkiye into eight extreme precipitation regions, while the Ward's method resulted in six distinct extreme precipitation regions. We evaluated the results based on the existing extreme precipitation climatology literature for Türkiye and by associating them to known precipitation dynamics, and as a result, we recommended eight precipitation regions determined by the K-means. The identified precipitation regions are expected to contribute to future studies analyzing the effects of climate change and to regional studies on natural disasters resulting from extreme precipitation."

The scientific objective is to improve forecasting of heavy-precipation events that lead to flash floods and landslides. 
 During the Water Vapor Lidar Network Assimilation (WaLiNeAs) campaign, eight lidars specifically designed to measure water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR) profiles were deployed on the western Mediterranean coast. The main objectives were to investigate the water vapor content during case studies of heavy-precipitation events in the coastal western Mediterranean and assess the impact of high spatiotemporal WVMR data on numerical weather prediction forecasts by means of state-of-the-art assimilation techniques. Given the increasing occurrence of extreme events due to climate change, WaLiNeAs is the first program in Europe to provide network-like, simultaneous and continuous water vapor profile measurements over a period of 3–4 months. This paper focuses on the WVMR profiling datasets obtained from three of the lidars run by the French part of the WaLiNeAs team. These three lidars were deployed in the cities of Coursan, Le Grau-du-Roi and Cannes. This measurement setup enabled monitoring of the water vapor content of the lower troposphere over periods of 3 months in fall and winter 2022, with some interruptions, and 4 months in summer 2023. The lidars measured the WVMR profiles from the surface up to approximately 6–10 km at nighttime and 1–2 km during daytime.

Our observational analysis suggests that considering high‐frequency wind components during the spring season may mitigate the SPB impact on ENSO predictability. The intraseasonal zonal wind in March over the equatorial western Pacific initially perturbs the sea surface temperature (SST). It contributes nearly 40% of the east‐west SST gradient after 2–3 months, ranking first among other calendar months. This significant contribution causes March to become the earliest month to effectively indicate the following ENSO direction due to the active eastward‐propagating Madden‐Julian oscillation (MJO) activity. Through the obvious variation of the eastward‐propagating MJO speed, it also shows the possible close relationship between the mean SST state and the interdecadal variability in intraseasonal zonal wind. Additionally, the current strong variability of intraseasonal zonal wind suggests the important role of atmospheric information in recent ENSO development."

However, atmospheric radiative transfer calculations are computationally expensive, especially when involving multiple‐scattering calculations in cloudy areas. In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have been increasingly applied to emulate and accelerate physical models. This study, for the first time, explores DL techniques to emulate all‐sky radiative transfer in microwave bands. The FengYun‐3E (FY‐3E) Microwave Humidity Sounder‐2 (MWHS‐2) was selected as the target instrument due to its comprehensive spectral coverage, with the radiative transfer for TOVS scattering module (RTTOV‐SCATT) serving as the reference model. Three DL architectures were trained and compared, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), Bidirectional Long Short‐Term Memory with Attention (BiLSTM‐Attention), and Transformer. The BiLSTM‐Attention architecture demonstrated superior performance in both clear‐sky and cloudy radiance simulations. This may be attributed to its bidirectional recurrent structure resembling physical radiative transfer processes and the attention mechanism's ability to link MWHS‐2 channels with corresponding vertical layers. Although DL models achieve high accuracy in forward prediction, they often struggle with instability in Jacobian calculations. To address this issue, the trained BiLSTM‐Attention model was fine‐tuned using the reference model Jacobians as physical constraints. The fine‐tuned BiLSTM‐Attention model accurately characterized radiance sensitivities to temperature, water vapor, and hydrometeors under different cloud conditions, indicating its potential to serve as a radiance observation operator in data assimilation and physical retrieval applications."

Prasad;Lionel P. Joseph;Sujan Ghimire;Ravinesh C. Deo;Nathan J. Downs;Rajendra Acharya;Zaher M. Yaseen,Explainable hybrid deep learning framework for enhancing multi-step solar ultraviolet-B radiation predictions,"•Explainable hybrid system is developed to forecast ultraviolet-B radiation at multi-step horizons. •Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) explains physical interpretations of model prediction outcomes. •Optuna and RFECV feature selection optimizes predictive performance ofxAImodel. •xAIprovides ultraviolet-B exposure information to help mitigate detrimental UV exposure effects. 
 Acute exposure effects of short-wavelength solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation can trigger skin-based diseases and eye health ailments in humans and animals, as well as disrupt photosynthetic or hormonal systems in plants. Within the UV wavebands, high levels of UV-B exposure are particularly severe and the leading cause of skin cancers. Therefore, accurate and explainable short-term UV-B forecasts are essential for effectively providing sun exposure information to the public and UV experts. To address this pressing issue, we developed an explainable hybrid TabNet framework optimized with the Optuna algorithm. The model was trained using predictors derived from satellite products and sky images for the experimental site in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. For model training, 3,863 data points were utilized from July 1, 2002 to February 29, 2004. The model development phase entailed dimensionality reduction using recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) and principal component analysis (PCA) methods. The proposed model outperformed all competing counterparts, achieving comparatively high correlation coefficients of 0.908, 0.880, 0.868, and 0.868 for hourly, 2-hourly, 3-hourly, and 4-hourly forecast horizons, respectively. Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) results, based on Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), indicate that the antecedent lagged memory of UV-B radiation and the solar zenith angle contribute significantly to UV-B predictions. Ozone effects and cloud cover conditions are also influential features in this respect. The superior capabilities of the newly designed hybrid explainable TabNet model affirm its potential for UV-B monitoring and mitigating the harmful sun exposure risks for the public and terrestrial life."

 This study investigates equivalent Black Carbon (eBC) and its corresponding impacts, encompassing fossil fuel combustion (eBCff) and biomass combustion (eBCbb), within the tropical semi-arid region of Kadapa (YVU; 14.47°N, 78.82°E, 138 m above sea level). The study was conducted from January 2017 to October 2018. BC varies diurnally and seasonally as a result of regional meteorological conditions and boundary layer dynamics. BC shows a bimodal variation with a peak in the morning (07:00 to 9:00 LT) after sunrise and in the evening (19:00 to 21:00 LT). Throughout the study period, it was observed that the concentration of equivalent Black Carbon (eBC) was elevated during the winter season but lower during the monsoon season. The cumulative average of eBC, eBCff, and eBCbb mass concentrations used for the entire research period were 1.55 ± 0.04, 1.39 ± 0.03, and 0.16 ± 0.004 μg/m3, respectively, with fossil fuel combustion being the primary contributor to the total eBC levels.

 The present study identifies a close linkage between spring (MAM) sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies in the Greenland-Barents (GB) Seas and the tropical cyclone (TC) genesis frequency over the eastern North Pacific (ENP) in the subsequent summer and fall (JJASON) during 1979–2022. An increase in MAM GB SIC anomalies results in a decrease in subsequent JJASON ENP TC genesis frequency. The physical process for the influence of Arctic sea ice anomalies on TC formation is further examined. Detailed dynamical diagnosis reveals that a higher GB SIC during MAM results in an increase in upward shortwave radiation, leading to sea surface temperature (SST) cooling. This SST cooling triggers a teleconnection atmospheric wave train, traversing Eurasia, the northern Pacific and the northern America and reaching the northern Atlantic. The associated anomalous cyclone over mid-latitude northern Atlantic is accompanied by anomalous southwesterly winds over the subtropics, leading to SST warming in the subtropical northern Atlantic through weakening total wind speed and upward surface latent heat flux. SST warming in the subtropical northern Atlantic extends southward into the tropical Atlantic via wind-evaporation-SST feedback during the subsequent summer and autumn, which induces an anomalous zonal-vertical circulation with descending motion over the ENP. This descending motion reduces relative humidity and weakens local convection over the ENP, and thus is unfavorable for TC genesis there. This study suggests that the spring GB SIC could serve as a potential predictor of JJASON ENP TC genesis."

 Since 2013, heavy pollution episodes have occurred frequently over the North China Plain after unprecedented efforts to reduce primary pollutants. In this study, a pollution process in Tianjin, a typical city in North China, was selected to investigate the impact of 3-D meteorological patterns on PM2.5 and meteorological element profiles obtained by tethered balloons and meteorological towers. The pollution episode lasted 4 days with hourly PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 150 μg·m−3 for 81 h and a peak concentration of 377 μg·m−3. In the early stages of the first pollution period, wind speed with height showed an almost opposite trend to PM2.5 concentrations. In the vertical direction, weak winds were frequently accompanied by PM2.5 peaks, whereas strong winds were favourable for the diffusion of pollutants. In the later stage, a stable boundary layer with a height of approximately 600–700 m, thermal inversion layer capping the boundary layer, uniformly high-humidity atmosphere (>80 %), and relatively uniform distribution of wind speed across heights contributed to the high PM2.5, which remained within the boundary layer, and the continuous growth of surface PM2.5 concentrations. In the secondary pollution period, the successive regional transport of particles from Beijing and Baoding was the main reason for the two surface PM2.5 peaks in Tianjin. Different regional sources elevate PM2.5 levels, further extending the duration of haze pollution. The results reveal that 3-D meteorological conditions are the key reason for heavy pollution occurrence in the context of pollution reduction."

We conclude that AntAir is suitable for surface climatological analyses and improvements are underway to enhance the spatial resolution to sub‐kilometer grid scales.

However, producing accurate representations of GW dynamics in this region in numerical models has proved exceptionally challenging. One reason for this is that questions remain regarding the relative contributions of orographic and non‐orographic sources of GWs here. We use three‐dimensional (3‐D) satellite GW observations from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder in austral winter 2012 in combination with the Gravity‐wave Regional Or Global Ray Tracer to backward trace GW rays to their sources. We trace over 14.2 million rays, through ERA5 reanalysis background atmosphere, to their lower atmospheric sources. We find that GWs observed thousands of km downstream can be traced back to key orographic regions, and that on average, all waves (orographic and non‐orographic) converge meridionally over the Southern Ocean. We estimate that across this winter, orographic sources contribute around ∼ ${\sim} $ 5%–35% to the total momentum flux (MF) observed near 60° ${}^{\circ}$S. The remaining proportion consists of waves from non‐orographic sources, which although typically carry lower MF, the large spatial extent of non‐orographic sources leads to a higher overall contribution. We also quantify the proportion of MF traced back to different regions across the whole southern high latitudes area in order to measure the relative importance of these different regions. These results provide the important insights needed to advance our knowledge of the atmospheric momentum budget in the southern high latitudes."

We use ERA5, MERRA–2, IMERG, Padang radar data, and cloud‐permitting scale simulations with WRF‐ARW V4.1.3 to understand the roles of the land breeze, gravity waves, and convective outflow in these two events. On February 1, convection organizes north of Padang and propagates approximately 100 km offshore. On February 4, a multicellular system organizes south of Padang and travels over 150 km offshore. Large‐scale environmental conditions reveal stronger westerly winds from the Indian Ocean on February 1 and strong northeasterly winds from the South China Sea on February 4. Both events occur in regions with high surface humidity and weak 900 mb winds along the coastline. WRF simulations show that on February 1, the sea breeze uniformly transitions to a land breeze, while on February 4, it forms chaotically. Convective outflow enhances offshore precipitation by interacting with the land breeze, creating additional convergence zones and intensifying convection. Gravity waves played a minor role, contributing to atmospheric instability. The results of this study conclude that offshore‐moving convection is primarily driven by the land breeze and convective outflow, with gravity waves playing a minor role. The land breeze initiates convection, while the convective outflow enhances and sustains offshore propagation by creating additional convergence zones and intensifying convection. Moisture advection precedes nocturnal propagation, increasing atmospheric instability and creating favorable conditions for nighttime offshore precipitation."

To evaluate the approach, we compare the deviation between the tropospheric NO2 concentration observed by satellite and two atmospheric composition model simulations driven by the newly estimated soil NOx emissions and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory. The estimated average soil NOx emissions in Europe are 1.7 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in 2019, and the annual soil NOx emissions are approximately 1.7 times larger than that of the CAMS inventory. The discrepancy originates mainly from the forests, which would mean that the soil NOx emissions over forest areas in Europe are currently underestimated by the CAMS inventory. The model evaluation indicates that the simulations driven by DECSO‐soil emissions performed significantly better than using CAMS‐soil. Overall, the simulated RMSE% of DECSO‐soil is lower than that of CAMS‐soil, approximately 6% lower in spring and 2% lower in autumn. Our method can easily be extended to other regions in the world despite having monthly variations that are very different from those in Europe."

 Rossby Wave Breaking (RWB) propels stratospheric ozone (O3) into the troposphere resulting in an augmentation of tropospheric ozone levels and leading to subsequent alterations in the tropospheric chemistry. Given the profound implications, it is crucial to understand RWB-induced ozone variations comprehensively beyond localized production and transport, particularly over densely populated Indian subcontinent. In this context, we investigated the role of RWB on tropospheric ozone variability followed by its relative contribution at the lower levels by leveraging the data from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) onboard Aqua satellite, along with Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global reanalysis. In this study, we used 232 RWB events for the period 2004–2021, revealing an enhancement of ozone concentration from the daily mean of corresponding RWB days in a climatological aspect. We examine the fraction of events that allows the stratospheric ozone transport down to the lower troposphere by analyzing the presence of significantly increased stratospheric ozone tracers (SOT) obtained from CAMS over the Indian subcontinent at various pressure levels during RWB days. Additionally, we subjectively examine stratospheric ozone intrusions into the lower troposphere using SOT and ozone from CAMS on a centroid based relative domain. Our findings reveal that only 46% of the total RWB events facilitate stratospheric ozone transport up to the surface level. Further, analysis reveals an enhancement of ozone before and after the maximum breaking, primarily in upper atmospheric levels. Our results also showed that the intrusion intensity yields diverse increments in various tropospheric layers (e.g., 150–250 ppbv at 100–250 hPa layers). Lower tropospheric ozone variations (850 hPa) to RWB correlates with intrusion intensity, resulting in anomalous changes of about 10–20 ppbv. It is observed that the upper-level positive potential vorticity anomalies catalyze ozone intrusion from the stratosphere, descending to lower levels on intense breaking days through downward transport. These findings deepen our understanding of RWB-induced tropospheric ozone variability and its relative contribution to the ozone changes over the subcontinent."

 Sulfur deposition (Sdep) is an important process of sulfur cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, thus estimating the spatiotemporal variations of Sdep is crucial to understand its impact on terrestrial ecosystems. Taking the developed Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in eastern China as the study area, the Sdep (in forms of gas-phase dry, particle-phase dry, and wet) were estimated based on the observations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The results showed that: the average Sdep flux in the YRD was 27.45 ± 8.60 kg S ha−1 yr−1, and the total Sdep was mainly attributed to the wet deposition (wet: dry = 1.43). The Sdep experienced a significant decreasing trend, which decreased by 36.81% in 2020, compared with that in 2006. In terms of spatial distribution, Sdep showed strong variations, ranging from 9.70 to 67.51 kg S ha−1 yr−1; the high-value hotspots, which were initially distributed in the northern border regions of the study area, along the Yangtze River, and the Hangjiahu Plain in Zhejiang, have moved to the Wanzhong Plain in Anhui and the Jinqu Basin in Zhejiang during 2006–2020; the rate of change in urban Sdep was significantly higher than that in rural areas, with an average annual rate of change of −1.15 against −0.79 kg S ha−1 yr−1.

 The mechanism of climate and vegetation change induced dust variations has been a phenomenal environmental concern in East Asia. However, the extent to which climate and vegetation cover separately affect the interannual variations of dust activity, is little known. Here in our study, the dust interannual variations and the contributions of climate and vegetation changes on dust variations were investigated and quantified through a regional climate model (RegCM4.9.5) and GeoDetector analysis. It is indicated that the dust aerosol optical depth, column burden and emission flux over East Asia all showed fluctuating downward trends followed by subsequent increases during 2000–2018. Climatic factors dominated the interannual variation of dust over East Asia, particularly the modulation of El Niño Southern Oscillation events. Vegetation improvement has occurred in most dust source regions across East Asia, playing a secondary yet positive role in dust variations, with an overall contribution rate of approximately 37 %. The spatial heterogeneity of dust variations in different regions was shaped by the effects of climate change and improved vegetation conditions."

However, even though it simulates the nonlinear relationship between the meteorological observations and fire intensity, the ability of the FWI to accurately represent global satellite-derived fire intensity observations is limited due to its empirical formulation based on a specific region. In this study, we propose a regionally-fitted fire parameterization method using feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) to understand the nonlinear relationship between the meteorological variables and the fire intensity, which eventually improves the parameterization accuracy. These FFNNs for each grid point utilize daily-averaged meteorological variables (2 m relative humidity (RH2m), precipitation (PRCP), 2 m temperature, and wind speed) as inputs to estimate the satellite-derived fire radiative power (FRP) values. Applying the proposed FFNNs for fire parameterization during the 2001–2020 period revealed a marked enhancement in cross-validated skill compared to fire intensity estimation based on the FWI. This improvement was particularly notable across East Asia, Russia, the eastern US, southern South America, and central Africa. The sensitivity experiments demonstrated that the RH2m is the most critical variable in estimating the FRP. Conversely, the FWI-based estimations were primarily influenced by PRCP. The FFNNs accurately captured the observed nonlinear RH2m-FRP and PRCP-FRP relationship compared to that of the FWI-based estimations."

However, these precipitation characteristics are dealt with separately, without examining whether magnitude and seasonality are jointly projected to change. Here we assess how the seasonality and magnitude of precipitation extremes are jointly projected to change for different climate scenarios. We perform analyses at the global scale using nine global climate models and four different emission scenarios. We identify large areas of the globe where the magnitude of the extremes is expected to increase as the emissions increase; at the same time, large changes in the seasonality of these extremes are projected to impact regions mainly located in the tropical and sub-tropical areas. These changes could impact our response and mitigation efforts and our resilience against such phenomena in response to climate change."

We modified the aerosol spectra and concentrations to simulate a warm stratiform cloud process in Jiangxi, China, using the WRF-SBM scheme. Research shows that different aerosol spectra have diverse effects on cloud droplet spectra, cloud development, and the correlation between dispersion (ε) and cloud physics quantities. Compared to cloud droplet concentration, ε is more sensitive to the volume radius. 
 Changes in aerosol amount and size distribution significantly impact cloud droplet size distribution, as aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs) and influence the relative dispersion (ε) of cloud droplet spectra. Relative dispersion plays a key role in parameterizing cloud processes in general circulation models (GCMs) and microphysical schemes, affecting precipitation estimates and climate predictions. However, the effects of varying aerosol modes on cloud microphysics remain debated, depending on thermodynamic conditions and cloud type. This study simulates a warm stratiform cloud in Jiangxi, China, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Spectra–Bin Microphysics scheme (SBM-FAST) from 18:00 on 24 December 2014 to 06:00 on 25 December 2014 (UTC). Satellite and aircraft observations were used to validate the simulation, showing good agreement in cloud structure. Sensitivity experiments were conducted by increasing nucleation, accumulation, and coarse-mode aerosols 5-fold and by reducing the total aerosol concentration to 1/5 of the control. Results show that higher aerosol concentrations enhance cloud formation and broaden droplet spectra, while lower concentrations suppress cloud development. Accumulation-mode aerosols increase small-droplet concentrations, while nucleation- and coarse-mode aerosols favor larger droplets. The correlation between ε and volume-weighted radius (Rv) shifts from positive to negative as Rv increases. This transition is driven by cloud droplet collision–coalescence, condensation, and activation. Increased accumulation-mode aerosol concentrations shift the ε–Rv correlation from negative to positive in the Rv range of 4.5–8 µm, while reduced aerosol concentrations strengthen the negative correlation. Regardless of different coalescence intensities, ε converges with the increase in number concentration of cloud droplets (Nc)."

These measurements coupled with coincident meteorological information provide a valuable data set needed to evaluate and improve model predictions of aerosols in a traditionally data-sparse region of South America. 
 Few field campaigns with extensive aerosol measurements have been conducted over continental areas in the Southern Hemisphere. To address this data gap and better understand the interactions of convective clouds and the surrounding environment, extensive in situ and remote sensing measurements were collected during the Cloud, Aerosol, and Complex Terrain Interactions (CACTI) field campaign conducted between October 2018 and April 2019 over the Sierras de Córdoba range of central Argentina. This study describes measurements of aerosol number, size, composition, mixing state, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) collected on the ground and from a research aircraft during 7 weeks of the campaign. Large spatial and multiday variations in aerosol number, size, composition, and CCN were observed due to transport from upwind sources controlled by mesoscale to synoptic-scale meteorological conditions. Large vertical wind shears, back trajectories, single-particle measurements, and chemical transport model predictions indicate that different types of emissions and source regions, including biogenic emissions and biomass burning from the Amazon and anthropogenic emissions from Chile and eastern Argentina, contribute to aerosols observed during CACTI. Repeated aircraft measurements near the boundary layer top reveal strong spatial and temporal variations in CCN and demonstrate that understanding the complex co-variability of aerosol properties and clouds is critical to quantify the impact of aerosol–cloud interactions. In addition to quantifying aerosol properties in this data-sparse region, these measurements will be valuable to evaluate predictions over the midlatitudes of South America and improve parameterized aerosol processes in local, regional, and global models."

However, despite decades of research, there is substantial uncertainty in the time remaining until specific regional temperature thresholds are reached, with climate models often disagreeing both on the warming that has occurred to-date, as well as the warming that might be experienced in the next few decades. Here, we adapt a recent machine learning approach to train a convolutional neural network to predict the time (and its uncertainty) until different regional warming thresholds are reached based on the current state of the climate system. In addition to predicting regional rather than global warming thresholds, we include a transfer learning step in which the climate-model-trained network is fine-tuned with limited observations, which further improves predictions of the real world. Using observed 2023 temperature anomalies to define the current climate state, our method yields a central estimate of 2040 or earlier for reaching the 1.5 °C threshold for all regions where transfer learning is possible, and a central estimate of 2040 or earlier for reaching the 2.0 °C threshold for 31 out of 34 regions. For 3.0 °C, 26 °C out of 34 regions are predicted to reach the threshold by 2060.

Various diagnostics have been put forward to quantify and detect such wave patterns, many of which incorporate low-pass time filtering to separate signal from noise.

This study examines the characteristics of VOCs, their sources, and their temporal evolution. It also assesses the impact of the policy change on VOC pollution during the monitoring period, thus providing a basis for further research on VOC pollution and source control. 
 Online volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored before and after the Omicron policy change at an urban site in polluted Zhengzhou from 1 December 2022 to 31 January 2023. The characteristics and sources of VOCs were investigated. The daily mean concentrations of PM2.5 and total VOCs (TVOCs) ranged from 53.5 to 239.4 µg m−3 and 15.6 to 57.1 ppbv, respectively, with mean values of  111.5 ± 45.1 µg m−3 and 36.1 ± 21.0 ppbv, respectively, throughout the period. Two severe pollution events  (designated as case 1 and case 2) were identified in accordance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (China's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) from 2012). Case 1 (5 to 10 December PM2.5 daily mean = 142.5 µg m−3) and case 2 (1 to 8 January PM2.5 daily mean = 181.5 µg m−3) occurred during the infection period (when the policy of “full nucleic acid screening measures” was in effect) and the recovery period (after the policy was canceled), respectively. The PM2.5 and TVOC values for case 2 are, respectively, 1.3 and 1.8 times higher than those for case 1. The precise influence of disparate meteorological circumstances on the two pollution incidents is not addressed in this study. The results of the positive matrix factor modeling demonstrated that the primary source of VOCs during the observation period was industrial emissions, which constituted 32 % of the total VOCs, followed by vehicle emissions (27 %) and combustion (21 %). In case 1, industrial emissions constituted the primary source of VOCs, accounting for 32 % of the total VOCs. In contrast, in case 2, the contribution of vehicular emission sources increased to 33 % and became the primary source of VOCs. The secondary organic aerosol formation potential for case 1 and case 2 were found to be 37.6 and 65.6 µg m−3, respectively. In case 1, the largest contribution of SOA formation potential (SOAP) from industrial sources accounted for the majority (63 %; 23.8 µg m−3), followed by vehicular sources (18 %). After the end of the epidemic and the resumption of productive activities in the society, the difference in the proportion of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from various sources decreased. Most of the SOAP came from solvent use and fuel evaporation sources, accounting for 32 % (20.9 µg m−3) and 26 % (16.8 µg m−3), respectively. On days with minimal pollution, industrial sources and solvent use remain the main contributors to SOA formation. Therefore, the regulation of emissions from industry, solvent-using industries, and motor vehicles needs to be prioritized to control the PM2.5 pollution problem."

We demonstrate that self-assembly of fatty acid nanostructures can impact water uptake and chemical reactivity, affecting atmospheric lifetimes, urban air quality (preventing harmful emissions from degradation and enabling their long-range transport) and climate (affecting cloud formation), with implications for human health. 
 Atmospheric aerosol hygroscopicity and reactivity play key roles in determining an aerosol's fate and are strongly affected by its composition and physical properties. Fatty acids are surfactants commonly found in organic aerosol emissions. They form a wide range of different nanostructures dependent on water content and mixture composition. In this study we follow nano-structural changes in mixtures frequently found in urban organic aerosol emissions, i.e. oleic acid, sodium oleate and fructose, during humidity change and exposure to the atmospheric oxidant ozone. Addition of fructose altered the nanostructure by inducing molecular arrangements with increased surfactant–water interface curvature. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was employed for the first time to derive the hygroscopicity of each nanostructure, thus addressing a current gap in knowledge by measuring time- and humidity-resolved changes in nano-structural parameters. We found that hygroscopicity is directly linked to the specific nanostructure and is dependent on the nanostructure geometry. Reaction with ozone revealed a clear nanostructure–reactivity trend, with notable differences between the individual nanostructures investigated. Simultaneous Raman microscopy complementing the SAXS studies revealed the persistence of oleic acid even after extensive oxidation. Our findings demonstrate that self-assembly of fatty acid nanostructures can significantly impact two key atmospheric aerosol processes: water uptake and chemical reactivity, thus directly affecting the atmospheric lifetime of these materials. This could have significant impacts on both urban air quality (e.g. protecting harmful urban emissions from atmospheric degradation and therefore enabling their long-range transport) and climate (e.g. affecting cloud formation), with implications for human health and well-being."

 Ozone depletion events (ODEs) occur every spring in the Arctic and have implications for the region's atmospheric oxidizing capacity, radiative balance, and mercury oxidation. Here, we comprehensively analyze ozone, ODEs, and their connection to meteorological and air mass history variables through statistical analyses, back trajectories, and machine learning (ML) at Villum Research Station, Station Nord, Greenland, from 1996 to 2019.We show that the ODE frequency and duration peak in May, followed by April and March, which is likely related to air masses spending more time over sea ice and increases in radiation from March to May. Back trajectories indicate that, as spring progresses, ODE air masses spend more time within the mixed layer, and the geographic origins move closer to Villum. Positive trends in ODE frequency and duration are observed during May (low confidence) and April (high confidence), respectively. Our analysis revealed that ODEs are favorable under sunny, calm conditions, with air masses arriving from northerly wind directions with sea ice contact.The ML model was able to reproduce the ODE occurrence and illuminated that radiation, time over sea ice, and temperature were important variables for modeling ODEs during March, April, and May, respectively. Several variables displayed threshold ranges for contributing to the positive prediction of ODEs vs. non-ODEs, notably temperature, radiation, wind direction, time spent over sea ice, and snow on land. Our ML methodology provides a framework for investigating and comparing the environmental drivers of ODEs between different Arctic sites and can be applied to other atmospheric phenomena (e.g., atmospheric-mercury depletion events)."

Furthermore, it provides the locations of the ray trajectories of the observations along various precipitation-related products interpolated into them with the aim of fostering the use of such dataset in scientific and operational applications. 
 Polarimetric radio occultations (PROs) represent an augmentation of the standard radio occultation (RO) technique that provides precipitation and cloud vertical information along with the standard thermodynamic products. A combined dataset that contains both the PRO observable retrievals and the RO standard retrievals, the resPrf, has been developed with the aim of fostering the use of these unique observations and fully exploiting the scientific implication of having information about vertical cloud structures with an intrinsically collocated thermodynamic state of the atmosphere. This paper describes such a dataset and provides detailed information on the processing of the observations. The procedure followed at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) to combine both horizontal (H) and vertical (V) observations to generate profiles equivalent to those in standard RO missions is described in detail, and the obtained refractivity is shown to be of equivalent quality compared to that from TerraSAR-X. The steps for the processing of the PRO observations are detailed, derived products such as the top of the signal are described, and validation is provided.Furthermore, the dataset contains the simulated ray trajectories for the PRO observation and collocated information with global satellite-based precipitation products, such as merged rain rate retrievals or passive microwave observations.

10.1021/acs.est.4c06977,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了一种新型Pt/CeO2催化剂用于耐水性甲苯燃烧。其核心在于通过构建Pt物种部分嵌入CeO2载体的界面嵌入结构，来提高催化剂的稳定性和抗水性，从而有效降解挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）。文章通过实验和理论计算证明，这种结构促进了晶格氧的活化和迁移，提高了催化活性，并促进了H2O的解离生成·OH，从而增强了抗水性。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为甲苯是一种重要的空气污染物，而催化燃烧技术可用于改善空气质量。研究成果可用于改进空气质量监测中的传感器和催化剂，并为卫星观测空气污染物提供参考。,"['Air quality monitoring', 'Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)', 'Toluene', 'Catalytic oxidation', 'Pt/CeO2 catalyst', 'Satellite observations of air pollutants', 'Ground-based sensors']",Menglan Xiao;Dawei Han;Xueqin Yang;Jing Yu;Bo Shi;Yucong Guo;Xiaolin Yu;Maofa Ge,Active Interfacial Perimeter in Pt/CeO2 Catalysts with Embedding Structure for Water-Tolerant Toluene Combustion,"Supported Pt catalysts are often subjected to severe deactivation under the conditions of high temperature and water vapor in catalytic oxidation; thus, the superior stability and water-resistant ability of catalysts have great significance for the effective degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, we constructed a Pt/CeO2-N catalyst with an active interfacial perimeter, in which Pt species were partially embedded in the defective CeO2-N support to prevent the sintering. A significant charge transfer between Pt species and ceria in the embedding structure occurred via the Pt-CeO2 interface, which induced the formation of a Pt4+-Ov-Ce3+ interfacial structure. Experimental research and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the active Pt4+-Ov-Ce3+ interface promoted the activation and migration of lattice oxygen, thus facilitating the participation of oxygen species in toluene oxidation. Consequently, Pt/CeO2-N showed excellent catalytic performance for toluene degradation. In situ DRIFTS and DFT calculation proved that the Pt4+-Ov-Ce3+ interfacial sites served as the intrinsic active center in the dissociation of H2O to generate ·OH, which contributed to the formation of benzaldehyde, thus remarkably improving the water-resistant property. This study provided a facile strategy for fabricating the interfacial embedding structure to enhance the catalytic activity and water tolerance for eliminating VOCs in practical application."

We show that this enhancement in suprathermal electron fluxes increased ion production from electron impact, so that dayside electron impact ionization rates exceeded photoionization rates during the ICME. This change in ion production mechanisms led to unusually high densities of the minor ions C+ ${\mathrm{C}}^{+}$ and O++ ${\mathrm{O}}^{++}$.

Before a TC forms, the radial gradient in infrared (IR) brightness temperatures (BT) is mainly influenced by the expansion of clouds with IR BT below 208 K. These clouds are most abundant between 0300 and 0600 LST and least abundant between 1500 and 1800 LST. Clouds within 200 km of the circulation center have a higher fraction and greater diurnal variation compared to those located at radii of 200–500 km.

 4-nitrocatechol (4NC) is a model compound of nitrophenols, an important group pf light-absorbing species, a.k.a., brown carbon (BrC), that have significant impacts on air quality and radiation forcing. This work aims to elucidate the kinetics, chemical and optical properties as well as oxidation potential (OP) of 4NC during aqueous photolysis. Results show that hydroxyl radical (∙OH) initiated photo-oxidation has the fastest reaction rate (6.1 × 10−5 s−1) followed by organic triplet state (3C∗) induced photolysis (3.8 × 10−5 s−1) and direct photolysis (2.4 × 10−5 s−1); the second-order rate constant of ∙OH with 4NC is determined to be 4.3 × 1010 M−1s−1. Reaction pathways of 3C∗-initiated photolysis and ∙OH-initiated photolysis are largely different, with the former generating more oxygenated species, but their mass yields of products after 12 h of irradiation are close (∼40 %). Aqueous ageing of 4NC overall leads to the decrease of light absorption, and the photo-bleaching rates are in an order of ∙OH (2.58 × 10−5 s−1) > 3C∗ (1.06 × 10−5 s−1) > direct photolysis (5.83 × 10−6 s−1); the second-order photo-bleaching rate constant of ∙OH with 4NC is 1.77 × 1010 M−1s−1. On the other hand, aqueous ageing can also produce BrC species (not sufficient to offset the photo-bleaching effect) of which some nitrogen-containing organics are an important part, and 3C∗-photolysis has the strongest production ability. Furthermore, aqueous photolysis of 4NC can decrease its OP, especially the ∙OH-photolysis products are nearly non-toxic while those from 3C∗-photolysis still has significantly high OP at the end of oxidation. Finally, we estimated the atmospheric lifetimes of 4NC against ∙OH in different atmospheric environments, which range from a few seconds to tens of hours."

 Atmospheric aerosol characteristics from the Western Ghats (WG), a region that plays a prominent role in modulating the Indian monsoon, was evaluated to study the impacts of long-range transport, local sources, and cloud processing on their chemical properties. Size-segregated aerosols collected from Ponmudi (8.8°N, 77.1°E), a tropical high altitude location (960 m a.s.l.) in the southern part of the WG, during the continental to marine air-mass transition phase (January–April 2020–2021) were analysed for major chemical components, including carbonaceous species, water-soluble ionic species, metallic elements and aerosol liquid water (ALW). The major aerosol components during the north-east monsoon period were identified as (NH4)2SO4, organic matter, and ALW derived from long-range transported biomass emission plumes undergoing cloud processing and aqueous-phase reactions with SO2. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis revealed the presence of aged and mixed aerosol types, with influence from local anthropogenic emissions and secondary formation processes. The source profiles for different air-masses indicate that the IGP air-mass is dominated by anthropogenic continental sources rich in sulphates, while the East Asian air-mass comprises highly aged continental emissions rich in organics and mixed with marine emissions from the Bay of Bengal. Fine mode aerosol mass was reconstructed, and organic matter to organic carbon conversion factor was estimated after mass closure, which revealed relatively high values for East-Asian air-mass, providing evidence for their oxidation during long-range transport. The hill station was also influenced by local urban valley emissions transported to the site via daytime convection and sea-breeze circulation. Consequently, the aerosol system over this region exhibited a complex mixture, with elemental carbon particles coexisting with sea-salt, sulphate, and secondary water-soluble organics. The findings highlight the need for further studies to understand the role of chemically processed and mixed aerosol system in modifying regional climate dynamics and air quality over such sensitive ecosystems."

This study examines a tropopause defined by potential vorticity – an analogue for angular momentum that changes sharply in the subtropics, creating a transport barrier. Between 1980 and 2017, this tropopause shifted poleward at lower altitudes and equatorward above, suggesting height-dependent changes in atmospheric circulation that may affect greenhouse gas distribution and global warming. 
 The dynamical tropopause acts as a transport barrier between the tropical upper troposphere and extratropical lowermost stratosphere and is characterized by steep gradients in potential vorticity (PV) along an isentropic surface. Hence, the latitudinal separation between the dynamical tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere can be used as a metric of upper-tropospheric width for assessing climate change impacts. Here, we obtain the PV-gradient-based dynamical tropopause (PVG tropopause) from four meteorological satellite-era reanalyses (ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, MERRA-2) and investigate its climatology, variability and long-term trends from 1980 to 2017. Our results show a distinct seasonal cycle with larger PV values and a poleward movement of the PVG tropopause in summer. The climatological tropopause PV values are substantially different between different reanalyses, but the tropopause latitude is similar. Significant interannual variability in the PVG tropopause latitude is related to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and weaker variability also to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and is consistently represented in reanalyses. In particular, El Niño correlates with equatorward shifts in the PVG tropopause and hence a decrease in upper-tropospheric width. Long-term trends in the PVG tropopause over the period 1980–2017 exhibit a distinct vertical structure with poleward shifts below 340 K potential temperature, equatorward shifts between 340 and 370 K, and poleward shifts between 370 and 380 K. This consistent widening at lower levels and narrowing in the upper troposphere also exhibit considerable zonal variability with  the  strongest upper-tropospheric narrowing over the eastern Pacific."

Turbulence at stratocumulus cloud top mixes in dry, warm air, which can lead to cloud dissipation. This process is challenging for coarse-resolution global models to represent. We show that global models nevertheless agree well with our process understanding. Global models also think the process is less important for the climate than other lines of evidence have led us to conclude. 
 General circulation models (GCMs), unlike other lines of evidence, indicate that anthropogenic aerosols cause a global-mean increase in cloud liquid water path (ℒ) and thus a negative adjustment to radiative forcing of the climate by aerosol–cloud interactions.  In part 1 of this series of papers, we showed that this is true even in models that reproduce the negative correlation observed in present-day internal variability in ℒ and cloud droplet number concentration (Nd). We studied several possible confounding mechanisms that could explain the noncausal cloud–aerosol correlations in GCMs and that possibly contaminate observational estimates of radiative adjustments.  Here, we perform single-column and full-atmosphere GCM experiments to investigate the causal model-physics mechanisms underlying the model radiative adjustment estimate.  We find that both aerosol–cloud interaction mechanisms thought to be operating in real clouds – precipitation suppression and entrainment evaporation enhancement – are active in GCMs and behave qualitatively in agreement with physical process understanding.  However, the modeled entrainment enhancement has a negligible global-mean effect.  This raises the question of whether the GCM estimate is incorrect due to parametric or base-state representation errors or whether the process understanding gleaned from a limited set of canonical cloud cases is insufficiently representative of the diversity of clouds in the real climate.  Regardless, even at limited resolution, the GCM physics appears able to parameterize the small-scale microphysics–turbulence interplay responsible for the entrainment enhancement mechanism.  We suggest ways to resolve tension between current and future (storm-resolving) global modeling systems and other lines of evidence in synthesis climate projections."

 The regulation introduced in 2020 that limits the sulfur content in shipping fuel has reduced sulfur emissions over global open oceans by about 80 %. This is expected to have reduced aerosols that both reflect solar radiation directly and affect cloud properties, with the latter also changing the solar radiation balance. Here we investigate the impacts of this regulation on aerosols and climate in the HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL climate model. The global aerosol effective radiative forcing caused by reduced shipping emissions is estimated to be 0.13 W m−2, which is equivalent to an additional ∼50 % to the net positive forcing resulting from the reduction in all anthropogenic aerosols from the late-20th century to the pre-2020 era. Ensembles of global coupled simulations from 2020–2049 predict a global mean warming of 0.04 K averaged over this period. Our simulations are not clear on whether the global impact is yet to emerge or has already emerged because the present-day impact is masked by variability. Nevertheless, the impact of shipping emission reductions either will have already committed us to warming above the 1.5 K Paris target or will represent an important contribution that may help explain part of the rapid jump in global temperatures over the last 12 months. Consistent with previous aerosol perturbation simulations, the warming is greatest in the Arctic, reaching a mean of 0.15 K Arctic-wide and 0.3 K in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic (which represents a greater than 10 % increase in the total anthropogenic warming since pre-industrial times)."

Beres;Julia Burkart;Elias Graf;Yanick Zeder;Lea Ann Dailey;Bernadett Weinzierl,"Merging holography, fluorescence, and machine learning for in situ continuous characterization and classification of airborne microplastics","We tested a method to identify airborne microplastics (MPs), merging imaging, fluorescence, and machine learning of single particles. We examined whether combining imaging and fluorescence data enhances classification accuracy compared to using each method separately and tested these methods with other particle types. The tested MPs have distinct fluorescence, and a combined imaging and fluorescence method improves their detection, making meaningful progress in monitoring MPs in the atmosphere. 
 The continued increase in global plastic production and poor waste management ensures that plastic pollution will be a serious environmental concern for years to come. Because of their size, shape, and relatively low density, plastic particles between 1 and 1000 µm in size (known as microplastics or MPs) emitted directly into the environment (“primary”) or created due to degradation (“secondary”) may be transported through the atmosphere, similarly to other coarse-mode particles such as mineral dust. MPs can thus be advected over great distances, reaching even the most pristine and remote areas of Earth, and may have significant negative consequences for humans and the environment. The detection and analysis of MPs once airborne, however, remains a challenge because most observational methods are offline and resource-intensive and, therefore, not capable of providing continuous quantitative information.In this study, we present results using an online in situ airflow cytometer (SwisensPoleno Jupiter; Swisens AG; Emmen, Switzerland) – coupled with machine learning – to detect, analyze, and classify airborne single-particle MPs in near real time. The performance of the instrument in differentiating between single-particle MPs of five common polymer types (including polypropylene, polyethylene, polyamide, poly(methyl methacrylate), and polyethylene terephthalate) was investigated under laboratory conditions using combined information about their size and shape (determined using holographic imaging) and fluorescence measured using three excitation wavelengths and five emission detection windows. The classification capability using these methods was determined alongside other coarse-mode aerosol particles with similar morphology or fluorescence characteristics, such as a mineral dust and several pollen taxa.The tested MPs exhibit a measurable fluorescence signal that not only allows them to be distinguished from other fluorescent particles, such as pollen, but also differentiated from each other, with high (> 90 %) classification accuracy based on their multispectral fluorescence signatures. The classification accuracies of machine learning models using only holographic images of particles, only the fluorescence response, and combined information from holography and fluorescence to predict particle types are presented and compared. The last model, using both the holographic images and fluorescence information for each particle, was the most optimal model used, providing the highest classification accuracy compared to employing models using only the holography or fluorescence response separately. The results provide a foundation for significantly improving the understanding of the properties and types of MPs present in the atmosphere."

The results of this study highlight the beneficial impact of data assimilation by effectively combining land surface model and satellite-derived data according to their relative uncertainty, thereby controlling not only transitional regions but also the regions with heavy snow accumulation that are difficult to detect by satellite. 
 Snow water equivalent (SWE), as one of the land initial or boundary conditions, plays a crucial role in global or regional energy and water balance, thereby exerting a considerable impact on seasonal and subseasonal-scale predictions owing to its enduring persistence over 1 to 2 months. Despite its importance, most SWE initialization remains challenging due to its reliance on simple approaches based on spatially limited observations. Therefore, this study developed an advanced SWE data assimilation framework with satellite remote sensing data utilizing the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) and the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land model. This approach constitutes an objective method that optimally combines two previously unattempted incomplete data sources: the satellite SWE retrieval from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and dynamically balanced SWE from the JULES land surface model. In this framework, an algorithm is additionally considered to determine the assimilation process based on the presence or absence of snow cover from the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) satellite, renowned for its superior reliability.The baseline model simulation from JULES without satellite data assimilation shows better performance in high-latitude regions with heavy snow accumulation but is relatively inferior in the transition regions with less snow and high spatial and temporal variation. Contrastingly, the AMSR2 satellite data exhibit better performance in the transition regions but poorer performance in the high latitudes, presumably due to the limitation of the satellite data in the penetrating depth. The data assimilation (DA) demonstrates the positive impacts by reducing uncertainty in the JULES model simulations in most areas, particularly in the midlatitude transition regions. In the transition regions, the model background errors from the ensemble runs are significantly larger than the observation errors, emphasizing great uncertainty in the model simulations. The results of this study highlight the beneficial impact of data assimilation by effectively combining  land surface model and satellite-derived data according to their relative uncertainty, thereby controlling not only transitional regions but also the regions with heavy snow accumulation that are difficult to detect by satellite."
10.5194/gmd-17-8751-2024,True,Geoscientific Model Development,这篇论文评估了CMIP6地球系统模型中19个模型对历史火灾的模拟结果。研究发现，大多数模型能够较好地再现全球火灾总量、空间格局、季节性和区域历史变化，但在模拟近几十年全球燃烧面积下降和低估火灾对气候变化的响应方面存在不足。CMIP6模型改进了CMIP5模型的三个关键问题：（1）模拟的全球燃烧面积小于观测值的一半；（2）未能重现非洲高燃烧面积；（3）火灾季节变化较弱。尽管CMIP6模型在捕捉火灾与气候和社会经济驱动因素之间的关系方面有所改进，但仍未能重现过去二十年全球燃烧面积和火灾碳排放的下降趋势，以及北半球中纬度地区的春季火灾高峰。这主要是因为低估了人为火灾抑制和农作物火灾。此外，模型低估了火灾对干湿条件的敏感性，表明需要改进燃料湿度估算。研究结果为改进火灾方案开发和利用CMIP6多模型输出生成可靠的火灾预测产品提供了指导。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据（例如，卫星观测的燃烧面积和碳排放）来评估模型的性能，并分析了火灾对大气成分（例如，气溶胶和碳排放）的影响。,"['aerosols', 'burned area', 'carbon emissions', 'fire carbon emissions', 'satellite-based products', 'remote sensing', 'air quality', 'climate variability', 'atmospheric composition']",Fang Li;Xiang Song;Sandy P.

Rabin;Roland Séférian,Evaluation of global fire simulations in CMIP6 Earth system models,"This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of historical fire simulations from 19 Earth system models in phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Most models reproduce global totals, spatial patterns, seasonality, and regional historical changes well but fail to simulate the recent decline in global burned area and underestimate the fire response to climate variability. CMIP6 simulations address three critical issues of phase-5 models. 
 Fire is the primary form of terrestrial ecosystem disturbance on a global scale and an important Earth system process. Most Earth system models (ESMs) have incorporated fire modeling, with 19 of them submitting model outputs of fire-related variables to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of CMIP6 historical fire simulations by comparing them with multiple satellite-based products and charcoal-based historical reconstructions. Our results show that most CMIP6 models simulate the present-day global burned area and fire carbon emissions within the range of satellite-based products. They also capture the major features of observed spatial patterns and seasonal cycles, the relationship of fires with precipitation and population density, and the influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the interannual variability of tropical fires. Regional fire carbon emissions simulated by the CMIP6 models from 1850 to 2010 generally align with the charcoal-based reconstructions, although there are regional mismatches, such as in southern South America and eastern temperate North America prior to the 1910s and in temperate North America, eastern boreal North America, Europe, and boreal Asia since the 1980s. The CMIP6 simulations have addressed three critical issues identified in CMIP5: (1) the simulated global burned area being less than half of that of the observations, (2) the failure to reproduce the high burned area fraction observed in Africa, and (3) the weak fire seasonal variability. Furthermore, the CMIP6 models exhibit improved accuracy in capturing the observed relationship between fires and both climatic and socioeconomic drivers and better align with the historical long-term trends indicated by charcoal-based reconstructions in most regions worldwide. However, the CMIP6 models still fail to reproduce the decline in global burned area and fire carbon emissions observed over the past 2 decades, mainly attributed to an underestimation of anthropogenic fire suppression, and the spring peak in fires in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, mainly due to an underestimation of crop fires. In addition, the model underestimates the fire sensitivity to wet–dry conditions, indicating the need to improve fuel wetness estimation. Based on these findings, we present specific guidance for fire scheme development and suggest a post-processing methodology for using CMIP6 multi-model outputs to generate reliable fire projection products."

Given the limited research on the OP of complex combustion aerosols, the effects of aging processes on their OP remain underexplored. We used online instruments to track the evolution of OP [via dithiothreitol (DTT) assays] during the aging of wood burning and coal combustion emissions by hydroxyl-radical-driven photooxidation and dark ozonolysis. We observed very substantial increases in the intrinsic OP (OPmDTT) of complex combustion aerosols (e.g., OPmDTT up to 100 pmol min–1 μg–1 for OH-aged wood burning emissions) within 1 day of equivalent aging. Further analysis in relation to the degree of oxidation revealed a potential for generalizing the OP of carbonaceous aerosols with average carbon oxidation state OS¯c values ranging from −1.5 to −0.5 by assuming they have a constant OPmDTT value of ∼10 ± 6 pmol min–1 μg–1. Additionally, we uncovered a strong dependency of OPmDTT on both the source/precursor and aging pathway with OS¯c above ∼−0.5. OH photooxidation was identified as an exceptionally efficient pathway for generating highly oxidized, multifunctionalized, and DTT-active products, particularly from wood burning emissions."

 Rainfall events are globally becoming less frequent but more intense under a changing climate, thereby shifting climatic conditions for terrestrial vegetation independent of annual rainfall totals1–3. However, it remains uncertain how changes in daily rainfall variability are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis and growth3–17. Here we use several satellite-based vegetation indices and field observations indicative of photosynthesis and growth, and find that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year. Specifically, we find that satellite-based vegetation indices are sensitive to daily rainfall variability across 42 per cent of the vegetated land surfaces. On average, the sensitivity of vegetation to daily rainfall variability is almost as large (95 per cent) as the sensitivity of vegetation to annual rainfall totals. Moreover, we find that wet-day frequency and intensity are projected to change with similar magnitudes and spatial extents as annual rainfall changes. Overall, our findings suggest that daily rainfall variability and its trends are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis, with potential implications for the carbon cycle and food security. Satellite data and field observations show that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year."

 The atmosphere over the Northeastern region of Brazil (NEB) contains a variety of different aerosol types: marine, soil dust, biomass burning, urban pollution, as well as mixed species. However, very few reliable information on aerosols is available for the region. Satellite data provides spatial and temporal coverage in places with low density ground-based observational networks, with Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products as most important information on the atmospheric aerosol load. To find out how different AOD products from satellites behave over the NEB region we compared AOD at 550 nm from MODIS retrievals aboard both NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, and ground-based derived AOD 550 nm from the two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites in the region, located in cities of Petrolina and Natal, between 2015 and 2018. We based our analysis on the following MODIS AOD retrievals products: Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB), the combined product (DTDB), DT 3 km resolution product (MxD3k) and MAIAC at 1 km resolution. Additionally, we used AOD from MERRA2 reanalysis for another comparison that may provide additional insight on which products perform best over the region. We also analyze and compare the seasonality of the AOD products to the four biomes of NEB, which are Amazon rainforest, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado and Caatinga (wooded savannah-like) biomes. Petrolina is located in the NEB largest biome, the Caatinga, while Natal is a coastal city in the Atlantic Forest. The results show that DB yields the best results for the Petrolina site. The analyses also show that in all biomes the AOD monthly averages decrease during austral autumn and winter and increase during spring and summer. The compared products show some differences in AOD, even though with similar patterns. MAIAC and DB show very similar values in all four biomes throughout the year, recommending the use of DB and MAIAC for studies in the Caatinga region."

To analyze this storm, 28 meteorological stations and 19 PM2.5 and PM10 stations were used. Dust particles were in the air for 16 h, and dust storm conditions lasted for up to 120 min. Hourly PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were up to 518 and 9983 µg m−3, respectively. For Lubbock, Texas, the maximum PM2.5 concentrations were the highest ever recorded. 
 The southwestern portions of the United States experience dust events frequently due to arid and semi-arid environments and close proximity to multiple deserts. On 26 February 2023, a dust event was initiated in New Mexico due to strong winds aloft mixing down to the surface. The dust intensified as it moved eastward into West Texas and developed into a dust storm (visibility <1 km) for multiple locations. This study examined the meteorological characteristics of this dust storm using 28 meteorological stations and examined the impacts on PM2.5 and/or PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 and 10 µm) concentrations using 19 air quality stations. The dust event lasted up to ∼16 h; dust storm conditions lasted from 5 to 120 min. The highest wind speed and wind gust recorded during the dust episode were 27 and 37 m s−1, respectively. This dust had a strong impact on the air quality in the area, as very high PM values were recorded across the region, and nine of the PM stations exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) daily threshold. The maximum hourly PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations recorded were 518 and 9983 µg m−3, respectively. These concentrations at the peak of the dust were an order of magnitude higher than the minimum hourly PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations recorded on the dust day. The highest hourly PM10–PM2.5 concentration recorded was 760 ± 1000 µg m−3, while the lowest hourly PM2.5 / PM10 concentration measured was 0.05 ± 0.01."

In the Po Valley, the system reacts rapidly, forming large amounts of SOA, while in Pertouli the SOA formation chemistry appears to have been practically terminated before the beginning of most experiments, so there is little additional SOA formation potential left. 
 A dual-chamber system was deployed in two different environments to study the potential of ambient air, which was directly injected into the chambers, to form secondary organic and inorganic aerosol. A total of 16 experiments took place during March 2022 in a polluted environment in the Po Valley, Italy, which is dominated by anthropogenic emissions. Another 15 experiments were conducted in the Pertouli forest, Greece, which is dominated by biogenic emissions. In both campaigns, ambient air containing highly oxidized (average O:C 0.7–0.8) aerosol was the starting point of the experiments, and its chemical evolution under the presence of OH radicals was followed. In the Po Valley secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation was observed in all experiments but one, and the SOA formed ranged from 0.1 to 10 µg m−3. Experiments conducted under more polluted conditions (usually at night and early morning) had significantly higher SOA formation, with the concentration of the organic aerosol at the end being about 4 times higher than the initial level. Also, production of 4–230 µg m−3 of ammonium nitrate was observed in all experiments due to the high levels of ammonia in this area. The produced SOA appeared to increase as the ambient relative humidity increased, but other parameters could also be responsible for this. There was not a clear relationship between the SOA and temperature, while higher SOA production was observed when the PM1 levels in the Po Valley were high. Contrary to the Po Valley, only one experiment in the Pertouli forest resulted in the formation of detectable SOA (about 1 µg m−3). This experiment was characterized by higher ambient concentrations of both monoterpenes and isoprene. In two experiments, some SOA was formed, but its concentration dropped below detection levels after 30 min. This behavior is consistent with local formation in a chamber that was not well mixed. Although both environments have organic aerosol (OA) with O:C in the range of 0.7–0.8, the atmosphere of the two sites had very different potentials of forming SOA. In the Po Valley, the system reacts rapidly, forming large amounts of SOA, while in Pertouli the corresponding SOA formation chemistry appears to have been practically terminated before the beginning of most experiments, so there is little additional SOA formation potential left."

With enhanced sensitivity and mass resolution, various species at a level of sub-parts per trillion (ppt) and organics with multiple oxygens (≥ 3) were observed. The fast photooxidation process in summer leads to an increase in both concentration and proportion of organics with multiple oxygens, while, in other seasons, the variations in them could be influenced by mixed sources. 
 Understanding the composition and evolution of atmospheric organic vapors is crucial for exploring their impact on air quality. However, the molecular and seasonal characteristics of organic vapors in urban areas, with complex anthropogenic emissions and high variability, remain inadequately understood. In this study, we conducted measurements in urban Beijing during 2021–2022, covering four seasons, using improved proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (Vocus-PTR-MS). During the measurement period, a total of 895 peaks were observed, and 512 of them can be assigned to formulas. The contribution of CxHyOz species is most significant, composing up to 54 % of the number and 74 % of the mixing ratio of total organics. With enhanced sensitivity and mass resolution, various species with multiple oxygens (≥ 3) or at a level of sub-parts per trillion (ppt) were observed, with 44 % of the number measured at sub-ppt level and 38 % of the number containing three–eight oxygen atoms. Organic vapors with multiple oxygens mainly consist of intermediate/semi-volatile compounds, and many formulae detected were reported to be the oxidation products of various volatile organic precursors. In summer, the fast photooxidation process generated organic vapors with multiple oxygens and led to an increase in both their mixing ratio and proportion, while, in other seasons, the variations in organic vapors with multiple oxygens were closely correlated with those of organic vapors with 1–2 oxygens, which could be substantially influenced by primary emissions. Organic vapors with low oxygen content (≤ 2 oxygens) are comparable to the results obtained by traditional PTR-MS measurements in both urban Beijing and neighboring regions."
10.5194/acp-24-13811-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了热带地区复杂对流组织中的对流活动，以及它们对降水和砧状云的影响。研究人员开发了一种新的可变亮温分割追踪算法，用于将复杂的对流组织分解成单个冷核结构进行单独追踪。该算法能够追踪冷核结构的演变（例如冷核亮温的变化、冷核的合并和分裂），并明确地将降水和砧状云与独特的冷核联系起来。研究结果表明，组织单元的持续时间、降水量和砧状云量与冷核峰值亮温之间存在简单的对数线性关系。冷核峰值亮温低于220K的组织单元寿命较长，而峰值亮温较高的组织单元则迅速消失。此外，冷核峰值亮温越低，发展和衰减阶段的累积持续时间、降水量和砧状云生成量的差异呈指数增长。合并和分裂的发生频率也与冷核峰值亮温存在对数线性关系。寿命较长且复杂的生命周期对降水贡献最大，而寿命较长且复杂的生命周期和寿命较短且简单的生命周期对砧状云量的贡献相当。该研究利用了红外亮温卫星图像数据，属于大气环境遥感技术范畴，与卫星观测和大气成分分析（云特性、降水）密切相关。,"['cloud properties', 'precipitation', 'infrared brightness temperature', 'satellite observations', 'convection', 'tropical meteorology', 'anvil cloud', 'cold-core', 'complex convective organization']",Zhenquan Wang;Jian Yuan,Observing convective activities in complex convective organizations and their contributions to precipitation and anvil cloud amounts,"Tropical convection organizations are normally connected complexes of many convective activities. In this work, a novel variable-brightness-temperature segment tracking algorithm is established to partition the complex convective organizations into structural components of single cold cores for tracking separately. The duration, precipitation and anvil amount of the tracked organization segments have strong loglinear relationships with brightness temperature structures. 
 The convective processes of precipitation and the production of anvil clouds determine the Earth's water and radiative budgets. However, convection could have very complicated convective organizations and behaviors in the tropics. Many convective activities in various life stages are clustered and connected in complex convective organizations, and distinguishing their behaviors is difficult. In this work, based on hourly infrared brightness temperature (BT) satellite images, with a novel variable-BT tracking algorithm, complex convective organizations are partitioned into organization segments of single cold-core structures as tracking targets. The detailed evolution of the organization structures (e.g., the variation in the cold-core BT, mergers and splits of cold cores) can be tracked, and precipitation and anvil clouds are explicitly associated with unique cold cores. Compared with previous tracking algorithms that focused only on variations in areas, the novel variable-BT tracking algorithm is designed to track the core structure in complex convective organizations and document the evolution of both the area and BT structures. For validation, the tracked motions are compared against the radiosonde cloud-top winds, with a mean speed difference of −1.6 m s−1 and a mean angle difference of 0.5°.With the novel variable-BT tracking algorithm, the behaviors of oceanic convection over the tropical western Pacific Ocean are investigated. The results show that the duration, precipitation and anvil amount of lifetime accumulation all have simple loglinear relationships with the cold-core-peak BT. The organization segments of the peak BT values less than 220 K are long-lived, with average durations of 4–16 h, whereas the organization segments of the warmer-peak BT values disappear rapidly within a few hours but with a high occurrence frequency. The decay process after the cold-core peak contributes to more precipitation and anvil clouds than the development process does. With the core peaking at a colder BT, the differences in the accumulated duration, precipitation and anvil production between the development and decay stages increase exponentially. Additionally, the occurrence frequency of mergers and splits also has a loglinear relationship with the cold-core-peak BT. For the life cycles of the same cold-core-peak BT, the lifetime-accumulated precipitation and anvil amount are strongly enhanced in complicated life cycles with the occurrence of mergers and splits, compared with those with no mergers or splits. For the total tropical convective cloud water budget, long-lived complicated life cycles make the largest contribution to precipitation, whereas long-lived complicated and short-lived simple life cycles make comparable contributions to the anvil cloud amount and are both important."

We prescribe different concentrations of ice-nucleating particles to our model to assess how these clouds respond to concentration changes, validating results with cloud and aerosol observations from the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica station. Our results show that aerosol–cloud interactions vary with temperature, providing valuable insights into Antarctic cloud dynamics. 
 Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) have an important function in the freezing of clouds but are rare in East Antarctica. At the Belgian Princess Elisabeth Antarctica station, immersion freezing INP concentrations between 6×10-6 and 5×10-3 L−1 have been observed with an activation temperature of −20 °C. These low concentrations offer a possible explanation for the occurrence of supercooled liquid water in clouds observed using the station's micro rain radar and ceilometer. We used the model of the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) in climate mode (CLM) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM) (COSMO-CLM2) with an added aerosol-cycle module to test the cloud phase's sensitivity in response to varying prescribed INP concentrations. We tested two cases, one in austral summer and one in austral winter, and analysed the differences resulting from INP concentration changes for an area around the station and over the Southern Ocean within the selected domain. Our results show a strong influence of the INP concentration on the liquid water path in both regions, with higher concentrations reducing the amount of liquid water. Over the Southern Ocean, this effect is stronger during winter: during summer, a significant portion of water remains in liquid state regardless of INP concentration. Over the continent, this effect is stronger during summer: temperatures in winter frequently fall below −37 °C, allowing homogeneous freezing. The largest increase in the liquid water fraction of total cloud hydrometeor mass is simulated over the Southern Ocean in winter, from 9.8 % in the highest tested INP concentration to 50.3 % in the lowest. The radiative effects caused by the INP concentration changes are small, with less than 3 W m−2 difference in the averages between different concentrations."

Measurements were done at atmospheric conditions (ambient pressure and temperature range) in air. 
 The rate coefficients of the reaction of hydroxyl radicals (OH) with 12 different volatile organic compounds (VOCs), namely methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), γ-terpinene, Δ3-carene, myrcene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, and mesitylene, were studied in an absolute rate study in 1 atm of air between 280 and 340 K using an OH reactivity instrument with a temperature-controlled flow tube. There are few or no measurements in the literature for the important monoterpene and aromatic compounds emitted by biogenic and anthropogenic sources, although the oxidation of these species is particularly important in the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and particles. The time-dependent decay of the OH concentration was measured in a flow tube, allowing the pseudo-first-order rate coefficient to be determined after the production of a moderately high OH concentration (about 1×109 cm−3) by the photolysis of ozone in the presence of water vapour. In contrast to many previous studies, the OH reaction took place in a volume at ambient conditions, while the detection of OH was achieved by fluorescence in a separate low-pressure detection volume. The VOC concentrations were measured using the total organic carbon method. With the methods used, a high accuracy of the rate constants is obtained (2σ uncertainties approximately 6 %)."

Walker;Patrick E. Sheese;Chris D. Boone;Ryan M. Stauffer;Anne M. Thompson;David W. Tarasick,Validation of ACE-FTS version 5.2 ozone data with ozonesonde measurements,"Ozone measurements from the ACE-FTS satellite instrument have been compared to worldwide balloon-borne ozonesonde profiles using pairs of closely spaced profiles and monthly averaged profiles. ACE-FTS typically measures more ozone in the stratosphere by up to 10 %. The long-term stability of the ACE-FTS ozone data is good, exhibiting small (but non-significant) drifts of less than 3 % per decade in the stratosphere. Lower in the profiles, the calculated drifts are larger (up to 10 % per decade). 
 Two decades of ACE-FTS, the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment – Fourier Transform Spectrometer, version 5.2 (v5.2) ozone data (2004–2023) are evaluated with ozonesonde data from across the globe. The biases between the ACE-FTS and ozonesonde measurements are first estimated by analyzing coincident data pairs. A second approach is taken for the validation by comparing the ACE-FTS and ozonesonde monthly mean time series, with the former generated by sampling the ACE-FTS data within latitude/longitude boxes (i.e., ± 5°/± 30°) surrounding the stations and calculating the monthly averages. The biases, correlations, variation patterns, and the mean states of the two time series are compared. The biases estimated in this way exhibit more consistent and smoother features than using the coincident pair method. The ACE-FTS and ozonesonde monthly mean time series are highly correlated and exhibit similar variation patterns in the lower stratosphere at all latitudes. The ACE-FTS instrument drifts for each station are assessed in terms of the long-term linear trends relative to ozonesondes, which, although highly stable, may have their own minor changes with time. The ACE-FTS ozone profiles exhibit in general high biases in the stratosphere for altitudes above ∼ 20 km, increasing with altitude up to ∼ 10 % at around 30 km. For altitudes between 20 km and the tropopause, biases of up to ± 10 % are found, depending on altitude and latitude with the largest biases found in the tropics and southern mid-latitudes. The ACE-FTS instrument drifts are generally non-significant overall in the stratosphere with high variation between the stations. Averaging the individual station instrument drifts within several latitude bands results in small non-significant drifts of within ± 1 %–2 % per decade in the northern mid-latitudes to high latitudes and the southern high latitudes. It also results in a positive but non-significant drift of up to 5 % per decade in the tropics and southern mid-latitudes, with overall uncertainties in this region ranging up to 5 %–10 % per decade  (2σ level) in the low stratosphere. As part of this assessment, an analysis of ozonesonde measurement stability using ACE-FTS as a transfer standard is conducted and finds small step changes in ozonesonde response at some stations. These results are in general agreement with recent findings using other satellite data sources."

Cooper;Pavlos Kollias,Dual-frequency (Ka-band and G-band) radar estimates of liquid water content profiles in shallow clouds,"This article presents a novel technique to estimate liquid water content (LWC) profiles in shallow warm clouds using a pair of collocated Ka-band (35 GHz) and G-band (239 GHz) radars. We demonstrate that the use of a G-band radar allows retrieving the LWC with 3 times better accuracy than previous works reported in the literature, providing improved ability to understand the vertical profile of LWC and characterize microphysical and dynamical processes more precisely in shallow clouds. 
 The profile of the liquid water content (LWC) in clouds provides fundamental information for understanding the internal structure of clouds, their radiative effects, propensity to precipitate, and degree of entrainment and mixing with the surrounding environment. In principle, differential absorption techniques based on coincident dual-frequency radar reflectivity observations have the potential to provide the LWC profile. Previous differential frequency radar reflectivity (DFR)  efforts were challenged by the fact that the measurable differential attenuation for small quantities of LWC is usually comparable to the system measurement error. This typically renders the retrieval impractical, as the uncertainty can become many times greater than the retrieved value itself. Theoretically, this drawback can be mitigated following two interconnected approaches: (1) increasing the frequency separation between the dual-frequency radar system to measure greater differential attenuation and (2) increasing the radar operating frequency to reduce the instrument measurement random error. Our recently developed 239 GHz radar was deployed during the Eastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) along with a variety of collocated remote sensing and in situ instruments. We have combined Ka-band (35 GHz) and G-band (239 GHz) observations to retrieve the LWC from more than 100 vertical profiles of shallow clouds with typical amounts of LWC smaller than 1 g m−3. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the Ka-band and G-band pair of frequencies offers at least a 65 % relative improvement in the LWC retrieval sensitivity compared to previous works reported in the literature using lower-frequency radars. This new technique provides a missing capability to determine the LWC in the challenging low liquid water path (LWP) range (< 200 g m−2) and suggests a way forward to characterize microphysical and dynamical processes more precisely in shallow clouds."

In this study, we develop a new approach for incorporating prior information in an inverse model using predictor variables, while simultaneously selecting the relevant predictor variables for the estimation of the unknown quantity of interest. 
 Inverse models arise in various environmental applications, ranging from atmospheric modeling to geosciences. Inverse models can often incorporate predictor variables, similar to regression, to help estimate natural processes or parameters of interest from observed data. Although a large set of possible predictor variables may be included in these inverse or regression models, a core challenge is to identify a small number of predictor variables that are most informative of the model, given limited observations. This problem is typically referred to as model selection. A variety of criterion-based approaches are commonly used for model selection, but most follow a two-step process: first, select predictors using some statistical criteria, and second, solve the inverse or regression problem with these predictor variables. The first step typically requires comparing all possible combinations of candidate predictors, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitive, especially for large-scale problems. In this work, we develop a one-step approach for linear inverse modeling, where model selection and the inverse model are performed in tandem. We reformulate the problem so that the selection of a small number of relevant predictor variables is achieved via a sparsity-promoting prior. Then, we describe hybrid iterative projection methods based on flexible Krylov subspace methods for efficient optimization.  These approaches are well-suited for large-scale problems with many candidate predictor variables. We evaluate our results against traditional, criteria-based approaches. We also demonstrate the applicability and potential benefits of our approach using examples from atmospheric inverse modeling based on NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite."

Our satellite-based estimation finds a rice methane emission of 0.85 (0.69–1.03) Tg a–1 from the province or an average emission factor of 22.0 (17.8–26.6) g m–2 a–1 when normalized by rice paddy areas. The satellite-based analysis reveals a 2 to 4 times lower bias in widely used global and national inventories, which lack up-to-date regional information. The inversion reduces the uncertainty of regional rice emissions by 73% relative to bottom-up estimates based on field flux measurements. The satellite inversion also shows that the highest rice methane emissions occur in June during the tillering stage of rice, decreasing toward ripening, indicating that the predominant water management practice in the region involves drainage and intermittent flooding after initial flooding. Process-based modeling further suggests that this practice can lead to a reduction of methane emissions by more than 50% compared to continuous flooding of rice paddies and natural wetlands."

Utilizing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its chemical composition data from 2000 to 2023, we observed a reduction in the disparity of PM2.5 concentrations between urban and nonurban areas. This reduction is linked to stricter emission controls in urban areas and the relocation of some emission sources to nonurban areas. However, the specific chemical constituents of PM2.5 and the driving factors behind these changes remain to be fully elucidated. By analyzing the proportions of PM2.5 components in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and their surrounding nonurban areas, we found that the narrowing gap in PM2.5 concentrations between urban and nonurban regions is associated with the convergence of the organic matter (OM) proportions in both areas. This convergence results from varying emission reduction strategies tailored to the distinct characteristics of urban and nonurban pollution sources in China. Coordinated governance between urban and nonurban areas should be considered, along with the implementation of integrated control and mitigation measures for multiple pollutants to further enhance air quality in China."

 Changes in hot and dry extremes in central Europe have been attributed to atmospheric circulation anomalies and land-atmosphere interactions. However, the strength of the underlying causal links and their historical trends have not been quantified. Here, we use Causal Effect Networks (based on the Peter and Clark momentary conditional independence algorithm) and show that hot extreme events in central Europe are driven primarily by anomalous atmospheric patterns and soil water deficiency. Dry extreme events are mainly induced by anomalous atmospheric patterns and soil moisture memory, and only marginally by temperature changes. We find that in the period 1979–2020, the influence of dry soil on temperature has been amplified by 67% during compound hot and dry extremes, while the impact of atmospheric drivers on soil moisture has intensified by 50% (36%) during compound (single) extremes. This work highlights the strengthened causal links of compound hot and dry extremes with their underlying drivers under global warming, which can lead to non-linear interactions and increase adaptation challenges.

 Over the last five decades, Arctic sea ice has been shrinking in area and thickness. As a result, increased marine traffic has created a need for improved sea ice forecasting on seasonal to annual time-scales. In this study, we introduce a novel UNET-based deep learning model to forecast sea ice concentration up to 12 months. Based on yearly hindcast validation, the UNET 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month predictions provided more accurate and stable predictions than did the four baseline models: the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the damped anomaly persistence (DP) forecast, and two deep learning approach, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). During years with large departures from the long-term trend, the proposed UNET model exhibited promising SIC prediction results with root-mean-square errors (RMSEs), which were reduced from 17.35 to 7.07 % compared to the four baseline models. Our findings also confirmed the relative importance of each predictor variable (temperature, incoming solar radiation, wind speed and direction) in long-term prediction. Past SIC conditions, together with surface temperature emerged as the most important factors for SIC prediction, especially in the marginal ice zone. Incoming solar radiation and wind speed and direction showed greater sensitivity in predicting SICs in areas with thin ice. This model offers the potential to shape Arctic development and management plans and strategies, ensuring extended forecasting periods and enhanced prediction accuracy."

 Earth Observation (EO) data can provide added value to nations’ assessments of vegetation aboveground biomass density (AGBD) with minimal additional costs. Yet, neither open access to global-scale EO datasets of vegetation heights or biomass, nor the availability of computational power, has proven sufficient for their wide uptake in climate policy-related assessments. Using Mexico as an example, one of the primary obstacles to enhancing their National Forest Inventory (NFI) with such global EO datasets is the lack of statistically defensible methodologies that do so, while addressing the nation’s existing reporting needs and gaps. In collaboration with the Comisión Nacional Forestal (CONAFOR), this study develops a geostatistical model that integrates vegetation height and AGBD estimates from NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and ESA’s Climate Change Initiative (CCI) with Mexico’s NFI to attain sub-national and geographically-explicit biomass predictions. The posited model includes spatially varying parameters, allowing flexibility to capture non-stationary relations between the EO-based covariates and NFI-estimated AGBD. Inference is conducted with Bayesian methods, allowing the computation of summary statistics, such as the standard deviations for single-location and area-wide predictions of AGBD. This enables the transparent disclosure and traceability of sources of uncertainty throughout the prediction approach. Results indicate strong model performance; the EO-based covariates explain 79% of the variance in NFI-estimated AGBD in a randomly withheld sample of 10% of observations and a heuristic root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.55 Mg/ha. Approximately 96% of the observations falling within the 95% credible intervals of our predictions, with some systematic under-prediction observed at AGBD ranges of >100 Mg/ha. To ease the operational uptake of the model for policy purposes, source code based in the ‘R’ language with the optional use of urban and (non)forest masks for AGBD predictions is released. It includes demonstrations for predicting AGBD in Mexico’s Natural Protected Areas, terrestrial ecological strata, and community forest management or payment for environmental services projects, which are commonly used delineations in its climate policy reports. For other nations considering the presented approach for policy purposes, the study discusses challenges concerning the use of EO-based covariates and the limitations of the model. It concludes with a broader call toward ensuring consistency in EO data streams, and prioritizing the co-development of EO-NFI integration approaches with nations in the future, thereby directly addressing their long-term climate policy needs."

 Did air quality improve during India's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)? Since its inception in 2019, 131 cities were designated as non-attainment cities, requiring comprehensive data collection on ambient concentrations, emission sources, emission intensities, and source contributions. Clean air action plans were developed with the goal of achieving a 40% reduction in PM10 pollution by 2026 compared to 2017 annual averages or reaching the national standard. Central government funding significantly boosted ambient monitoring capacity in all cities, increasing it by 3–4 times through the installation of at least one manual or continuous monitoring station per city to track pollution levels. The unitless air quality index from the daily bulletins recorded a drop of 13% between 2019 and 2023, which cannot be accorded to a single pollutant. Presence of PM10 as the conditional pollutant in the daily AQI bulletins doubled during this period, in contrast to reports saying 95 of the 131 cities have improved PM10 pollution levels. Delhi, the most polluted capital city in the 2023 world rankings, showed no significant change in annual average PM2.5 concentrations. An agro-climatic airshed level assessment of TROPOMI satellite retrievals shows an increase in the atmospheric loading of gaseous SO2 and NO2 emissions and a change in the residual aerosol index signifying an increase in particulate emissions from combustion sources. Moving forward, tracking NCAP progress will require at least a tenfold increase in monitoring capacity, establishment of multi-pollutant emissions baselines, and a shift in evaluation to regional airshed scales to provide a better spatial representation of emission activities extending beyond city limits."

 Variations in snow cover could have profound impacts on regional and large-scale circulations and climate anomalies. Previous studies have focused on their effects on mid- to low-latitude weather without considering the impacts on the Arctic climate. Here, we propose that the snow cover in Europe and Central Siberia is an important land factor for the early spring 2 m temperature (T2m) interannual variability in the Barents–Kara Sea (BKS). In years when there is less snow over Europe and Central Siberia, there are positive radiative forcing at the surface, which can lead to elevated surface air temperatures, contributing to upward surface sensible heat flux anomalies. Correspondingly, anomalous anticyclones appear in the mid-upper troposphere, accompanied by enhanced southwesterly winds over the northern side of Europe and southerly winds over the western side of Central Siberia, enhancing the transport of atmospheric heat and moisture to the BKS and their conservation. Such variations consequently increase the downwelling longwave radiation and T2m over the BKS. Moreover, the negative correlation between Eurasian SWE and BKS T2m can be identified by most CMIP6 models and by multi-model ensemble (MME) results. Additionally, the multidecadal fluctuations in the Eurasian SWE–Arctic T2m connection are strongly out of phase with the PDO index, which can be effectively captured in the CMIP6 MME results. Furthermore, among two different PDO- periods, the BKS T2m were influenced mainly by variation in SWE in Central Siberia during P1 (1962–1977) and, conversely, were impacted mainly by variation in SWE in Europe during P3 (1999–2012)."

 Atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles are critical for understanding atmospheric complexity and environmental protection. To unify the inversion algorithms of different stations, this paper establishes optimal model parameters for various stations in China using the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model. Additionally, a novel BPNN-based Temperature and Humidity Profile Retrieval (BPNNTR) model is proposed to improve the accuracy of atmospheric temperature and humidity profile inversions. Firstly, sensitivity experiments using 31 stations alongside the MonoRTM and BPNN models, were conducted to identify the optimal model parameters. Subsequently, Microwave Radiometer (MWR) datasets from the Xi'an and Taiyuan stations were used to train the new BPNNTR model. The experimental results indicate that the optimal model parameters for atmospheric temperature profile retrieval include 2 hidden layers and 1024 nodes. The retrieval errors exhibit a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 1.9 °C, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 2.5 °C and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R) abrove 0.99. For humidity profile retrieval, the optimal parameters range from 1 to 4 hidden layers and 512 to 1024 nodes, with most regions achieving the best results with 2 or 3 hidden layers and 1024 nodes. In these cases, the MAE is below 12 %, the RMSE is below 16 %, and R exceeds 0.80. At the Xi'an station, the BPNNTR model improves temperature profile retrieval accuracy by 5 % under sunny days, while significantly improving humidity profile retrieval by 15 % on sunny days, 12.6 % on rainy days, and 12.5 % on cloudy days. At the Taiyuan station, the model boosts retrieval accuracy by over 15 % on rainy days and maintains stable performance for humidity profiles, improving fitting accuracy by more than 11 % under cloudy days.

10.1088/1748-9326/ad95a1,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了内亚地区极端高温变化的放大效应，尤其关注土壤湿度与大气之间的耦合作用。研究发现，近几十年来，内亚地区极端高温增温速度远高于夏季平均增温速度，这种现象在南部地区尤为显著。通过拉格朗日温度异常方程分析，研究确定了导致这种“额外高温增温”的主要原因是绝热加热的增加，而这主要与土壤变干有关。土壤变干限制了蒸发，增加了感热通量，从而引发了土壤湿度-温度的正反馈。研究强调了局部土壤水分亏缺对极端高温加剧的重大影响，并建议采取草地和牲畜管理策略以及抗旱措施。虽然论文没有直接提及具体的遥感技术或卫星，但其研究内容与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如利用卫星观测土壤湿度、地表温度和气温等数据，分析极端高温事件，并研究其与大气成分（如水汽）之间的相互作用。因此，该研究可以为改进气候变化预测模型，提高极端高温事件预警能力提供重要的科学依据。,"['soil moisture', 'temperature', 'extreme heat', 'diabatic heating', 'evaporation', 'satellite remote sensing', 'land surface temperature', 'air temperature', 'climate change', 'meteorological satellites']",Zejiang Yin;Buwen Dong;Song Yang;Wei Wei,Soil moisture–atmosphere coupling amplifies the change in extreme heat in inner East Asia under rapid summer warming,"Inner East Asia (IEA) is an important component of the global grassland ecosystem and has experienced a more rapid increase in extreme surface air temperatures compared to the summer mean in recent decades (2001–2020, relative to 1971–1990). This excess hot-extreme warming (EHEW) is particularly pronounced in the southern IEA, where extremely hot temperatures have increased twice as quickly as the summer mean warming, which itself already exceeds global-land warming by more than threefold. A quantitative analysis based on a Lagrangian temperature-anomaly equation along air-parcel backward trajectories initiated on hot days across IEA reveals that the observed EHEW is primarily attributable to increased diabatic heating, which predominantly occurs from 2 days before to the hot days. Meanwhile, changes in heat-prone synoptic-scale circulation only exert a limited influence on the excess warming. Soil drying within IEA appears to be a critical factor contributing to increased diabatic heating through soil moisture–atmosphere coupling, as it limits evaporation and enhances sensitive heat flux, thereby triggering positive soil moisture-temperature feedback. Our analysis underscores the significant impact of local soil moisture deficits on the intensified extreme heat. Urgent implementation of grassland and livestock management strategies, coupled with drought mitigation measures, is essential for adaptation and ecosystem conservation."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad975b,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了中亚地区8544个湖泊和水库的储水量变化。它利用长期光学遥感数据和多源地形高程数据，从1990年到2020年，获得了这些湖泊和水库的月度储水量时间序列。研究发现，区域总储水量以每年−4.78 ± 0.88立方公里的速度下降，主要原因是咸海干涸。其他湖泊中，26%的湖泊储水量减少，22%的湖泊储水量增加。在流域尺度上，小型和中型湖泊(<5000平方公里)的长期变化主要由地表径流变化引起，而地表径流变化又受降水和温度变化的共同影响。此外，研究还发现，中亚地区29%的湖泊在过去几十年里经历了频繁的季节性干涸，这主要是由于夏季蒸发量大造成的。对于大多数(63 ± 8%)这样的湖泊，它们的蒸发水损失大于季节性储水量下降。这项研究强调了地表径流和湖泊蒸发在干旱和半干旱地区储水量损失中的共同作用。研究中使用了卫星遥感技术，例如机载或星载测高仪，以及光学遥感技术，来获取湖泊水位的变化信息，并结合其他数据分析了影响湖泊储水量变化的因素。,"['Satellite observation', 'Remote sensing', 'altimetric sensors', 'optical remote sensing', 'water storage', 'lake evaporation', 'precipitation', 'temperature']",Gang Zhao;Suxia Liu;Haoxin Deng;Qiuhong Tang;Chi Zhang;Yanan Su;Fahu Chen,Identifying drivers of storage dynamics of lakes and reservoirs in the arid Central Asia,"Knowing the storage variations in lakes and reservoirs are essential for water resources and environmental management, especially in the regions facing water scarcity. However, the quantification of the storage changes is limited by sparse in-situ observations and spatial coverage of space (air)-borne altimetric sensors that have been used conventionally in storage retrieval. This hampers the attribution analysis of lake storage changes. Here, we combined long-term optical remote sensing and multi-source terrain elevation data to derive the monthly storage time series from 1990 to 2020 for 8544 lakes and reservoirs in Central Asia, where water scarcity has been bottle-necking local socioeconomic sustainability. The regional total storage has been decreasing with a rate of −4.78 ± 0.88 km3 yr−1 mainly owing to the desiccation of the Aral Sea. For other lakes, 26% of them show decreasing while 22% show increasing trends. At a watershed-scale, the long-term changes in small to medium-sized (<5000 km2) lakes are primarily caused by the changes in surface runoff, jointly affected by precipitation and temperature changes. We also found that 29% lakes in Central Asia experienced frequent seasonal dry out in the past decades. Such seasonal dry out is mainly caused by fast evaporation losses during the summer months. For the majority (63 ± 8%) of these lakes, their evaporation water losses are larger than the seasonal storage drawdown. Our analysis highlights the co-regulation of surface runoff and lake evaporation in the storage losses in arid and semi-arid regions."

While there is some evidence pollution exposure during pregnancy is associated with slowed child growth, this evidence is largely limited to empirical settings in which it is difficult to disentangle the role of pollution from other co-varying factors. Here we rely on quasi-random variation in pollution conditions induced by thermal inversions to estimate the impact of pollution spikes during pregnancy on childhood stunting. We find that thermal inversions during pregnancy worsen air quality and increase the likelihood of childhood stunting, but only in places with poor baseline air quality and particularly for younger children and in lower-wealth communities. Our estimates imply that a 1  µg m−3 increase in average PM2.5 concentration during pregnancy increases the probability of stunting by an average of 4.1 percentage points (95% CI: 0.2–8.0). This translates to an 11.2% increase (95% CI: 0.6%–21.9%) in stunting risk from the sample baseline of 37% children stunted. Our results suggest that policies that limit baseline daily PM2.5 levels, particularly during seasons when thermal inversions are more frequent, have potential to generate meaningful improvements in long-run child outcomes."

Howell,Aerosol hygroscopicity over the southeast Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning season – Part 1: From the perspective of scattering enhancement​​​​​​​,"Using airborne measurements over the southeast Atlantic Ocean, we examined how much moisture aerosols take up during Africa’s biomass burning season. Our study revealed the important role of organic aerosols and introduced a predictive model for moisture uptake, accounting for organics, sulfate, and black carbon, summarizing results from various campaigns. These findings improve our understanding of aerosol–moisture interactions and their radiative effects in this climatically critical region. 
 Aerosol hygroscopicity plays a vital role in aerosol radiative forcing. One key parameter describing hygroscopicity is the scattering enhancement factor, f(RH), defined as the ratio of the scattering coefficient at humidified relative humidity (RH) to its dry value. Here, we utilize the f(80 %) from ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) 2016 and 2018 airborne measurements to investigate the hygroscopicity of aerosols, its vertical distribution, its relationship with chemical composition, and its sensitivity to organic aerosol (OA) hygroscopicity over the southeast Atlantic (SEA) Ocean during the biomass burning (BB) season.We found that aerosol hygroscopicity remains steady above 2 km, with a mean f(80 %) of 1.40 ± 0.17. Below 2 km, aerosol hygroscopicity increases with decreasing altitude, with a mean f(80 %) of 1.51 ± 0.22, consistent with higher values of BB aerosol hygroscopicity found in the literature. The hygroscopicity parameter of OA (κOA) is retrieved from the Mie model with a mean value of 0.11 ± 0.08, which is in the middle to upper range compared to the literature. Higher OA hygroscopicity is related to aerosols that are more aged, oxidized, and present at lower altitudes. The enhanced biomass burning aerosol (BBA) hygroscopicity at lower altitudes is mainly due to a lower OA fraction, increased sulfate fraction, and greater κOA at lower altitudes.We propose a parameterization that quantifies f(RH) with chemical composition and κOA based on Mie simulation of internally mixed OA–(NH4)2SO4–BC mixtures. The good agreement between the predictions and the ORACLES measurements implies that the aerosols in the SEA during the BB season can be largely represented by the OA–(NH4)2SO4–BC internal mixture with respect to the f(RH) prediction. The sensitivity of f(RH) to κOA indicates that applying a constant κOA is only suitable when the OA fraction is low and κOA shows limited variation. However, in situations deviating these two criteria, κOA can notably impact scattering coefficients and aerosol radiative effect; therefore, accounting for κOA variability is recommended."

In this study, reflectivity changes induced by glaciogenic seeding using different AgI concentrations are investigated under various conditions, and a method is developed to estimate the AgI concentration needed to detect unambiguous seeding signatures. The results aid in operational seeding-based decision-making regarding the amount of AgI dispersed. 
 Detecting an unambiguous radar reflectivity signature is vital for investigating cloud-seeding impacts. The radar reflectivity change attributed to seeding depends on both the cloud conditions and the concentration of silver iodide (AgI) particles. In this study, the reflectivity change induced by glaciogenic seeding using different AgI particle concentrations is investigated under various cloud conditions using a 1D ice growth model coupled with an AgI nucleation parameterization. In addition, an algorithm is developed to estimate the minimum AgI particle concentration needed for a measurable glaciogenic cloud-seeding signature, assuming there is sufficient supercooled liquid water. The results show that the 1D model captures the ice growth habit compared to available observations and yields an unambiguous reflectivity change that is consistent with 3D model simulations and previous observational studies. Simulations indicate that seeding at a temperature of about −15 °C has the highest probability of detecting the radar seeding signature. This finding is consistent with the fact that the seeding temperature was about −15 °C or slightly warmer in most documented cases of unambiguous seeding signatures. Using the 1D model, 2500 numerical experiments are conducted, and the outputs are used to develop a parameterization to estimate the AgI particle concentration needed to detect an unambiguous seeding signature. Application of this parameterization to a real case suggests that seeding between −21 and −11 °C may possibly produce unambiguous seeding signatures and that seeding at about −15 °C requires the lowest AgI particle concentration. Seeding at warmer temperatures in precipitating clouds requires an extremely high amount of AgI and a very high content of supercooled liquid water. The results shown in this study deepen our understanding of the relationship between AgI particle concentration and radar seeding signatures under different cloud conditions. The parameterization can be used in operational seeding-based decision-making regarding the optimal amount of AgI dispersed."

The algorithm has been successfully validated against test scenes. 
 The Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite mission is expected to provide new insights into aerosols, clouds, and radiation. The satellite's payload includes four instruments designed to synergistically retrieve vertical profiles of clouds and aerosols, along with the atmospheric radiation data. This will enable the determination of atmospheric heating rates and top-of-atmosphere radiances and fluxes. This paper focuses on the BMA-FLX processor, specifically created, developed, and validated to retrieve thermal and solar top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes from longwave and shortwave radiances, measured along track by the EarthCARE Broad-Band Radiometer (BBR) instrument. These radiances are co-registered either at the surface or, in cloudy conditions, at the radiatively most significant vertical layer of the atmosphere (reference level). The Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) and Atmospheric Lidar (ATLID) on board EarthCARE support cloud identification, while meteorological data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts provide the surface and atmospheric necessary information. In the BMA-FLX processor, flux is estimated independently for each BBR view using different approaches for the longwave and shortwave radiances. A combined flux, derived from co-registered radiances at the reference level, is provided as the best estimate for a given scene. The radiance-to-flux conversion algorithms have been successfully validated through end-to-end verification using L1 and L2 synthetic data for three EarthCARE orbits. In general, a good agreement is found between the retrieved fluxes and the model truth, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) varying between 7 and 18 W m−2 for the solar fluxes and lower than 6 W m−2 for the thermal fluxes. The BMA-FLX's objective is to achieve radiative closure for EarthCARE with solar and thermal fluxes within 10 W m−2."

The influence of emission sources on particle concentrations is not only constrained by meteorological conditions but often intertwined with them, making it challenging to separate these effects. This study utilized valuable long-term particle number and size distribution (PNSD) data from 2018 to 2023 to develop a tree-based machine learning model enhanced with an interpretable component, incorporating temporal markers to characterize background or time series residuals. Our results demonstrated that, differing from PM2.5, which is significantly shaped by planetary boundary layer height, wind speed plays a crucial role in determining the particle number concentration (PNC), showing strong regional specificity. Furthermore, we systematically identified and analyzed anthropogenically influenced periodic trends. Notably, while Aitken mode observations are initially linked to traffic-related peaks, both Aitken and nucleation modes contribute to concentration peaks during rush hour periods on short-term impacts after deweather adjustment. Pollutant baseline concentrations are largely driven by human activities, with meteorological factors modulating their variability, and the secondary formation of UFPs is likely reflected in temporal residuals. This study provides a flexible framework for isolating meteorological effects, allowing more accurate assessment of anthropogenic impacts and targeted management strategies for UFP and PNC."

In chamber experiments, we have systematically explored their gas phase oxidation by hydroxyl radical (•OH) as a potential source of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). •OH-initiated oxidation of both compounds in the presence of ammonium bisulfate aerosol resulted in substantial aerosol volume growth. Compositions of low-volatility products in both the gas and particulate phases were established by high-resolution mass spectrometry measurements. Under conditions mimicking the Southeast USA (50% relative humidity, bulk seed aerosol pH 1.4), we estimate the SOA yield from •OH-initiated oxidation of 3-methylenebutane-1,2,4-triol to be 93.1%, equating to 1.95 ± 0.81 Tg C Yr-1, and from 3-methyltetrahydrofuran-2,4-diol oxidation to be 26.7%, equating to 1.76 ± 1.26 Tg C Yr-1.

Reduced dissolved inorganic carbon in the tropics weakens outgassing, while high ocean temperatures diminish uptake in the low‐to‐mid latitudes.

Configuration of the 10–30‐day quasi‐barotropic wave train at mid–high latitudes with the dipolar pattern of tropical convection leads to the concurrence of strong moisture convergence and anomalous descents over southern China. The increased downward longwave radiation in association with moisture enhancement, shortwave radiation and adiabatic heating in association with descents bring about the persisting hot and humid conditions in humid heatwaves. Due to stronger barotropic energy conversion from mean flow to 10–30‐day circulation at mid–high latitudes, and stronger tropical convection activities in the recent decade, the occurrence of 10–30‐day circulation configuration induced humid heatwaves has increased by 13.3%, thus leading to the predominance of humid heatwaves."

We found that calm weather conditions due to subsidence on the tropical cyclone periphery were conducive to the formation of sea breeze, lake breeze and ozone pollution. The sea and lake breezes had opposite directions, resulting in relay transport of ozone. When polluted air masses passed through, urban areas experienced repeated ozone pollution. Furthermore, urbanization altered the surface energy balance through increased urban land use (LU) and anthropogenic heat (AH) release, raising urban temperature and enhancing urban heat island circulation. This led to higher ozone concentrations in urban areas, especially where urban LU and AH emissions were concentrated, further exacerbating ozone pollution."

The latitude of the auroral brightening was clearly lower than usual, suggesting near‐Earth reconnection (NERX) was closer to Earth than during substorms (∼20–30RE). GOES‐18 at midnight detected magnetic field and plasma signatures consistent with DFBs, following an extremely thin current sheet likely compressed by strong upstream dynamic pressure. These results indicate NERX could have been close enough for resultant DFBs to penetrate geosynchronous orbit and contribute to the ring current during the recovery phase. This scenario deserves further examination in future."
10.1029/2024GL110954,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文利用全球范围内的卫星观测和涡动协方差塔观测数据，研究了气候因素对生态系统总初级生产力(GPP)昼夜变化模式的影响。研究发现，蒸汽压亏缺(VPD)的增加导致GPP活动在一天中的峰值提前到清晨，尤其是在干旱地区和植被矮小的地区。在解开VPD、温度和土壤湿度之间强相关性的基础上，研究揭示了VPD是导致全球陆地植被光合作用普遍出现午后下降的主要驱动因素。然而，地球系统模型(ESMs)系统性地低估了VPD在调节光合作用中的重要作用，许多模型显示出光合作用在下午的增加，这主要归因于温度的影响。该研究强调需要改进ESMs中VPD对光合作用昼夜变化负面影响的模拟。总的来说，这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测数据来研究大气因素(VPD)对陆地生态系统的影响，这属于大气成分分析和遥感应用的范畴。,"['vapor pressure deficit', 'satellite observations', 'gross primary production (GPP)', 'Earth System Models (ESMs)', 'diurnal photosynthesis', 'atmospheric dryness', 'remote sensing']",Yue Liu;Josep Peñuelas;Alessandro Cescatti;Yongguang Zhang;Zhaoying Zhang,Atmospheric Dryness Dominates Afternoon Depression of Global Terrestrial Photosynthesis,"Satellite observations reveal a widespread afternoon depression of photosynthesis globally. Utilizing satellite observations and eddy covariance tower‐based observations worldwide, we investigated the impact of climate factors on the diurnal patterns of ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). Our analysis revealed that the increase in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) shifts the diurnal peak of GPP activity to earlier morning hours, particularly in drylands and areas with short vegetation. After disentangling the strong correlations among VPD, temperature, and soil moisture, we unraveled that VPD emerges as the dominant driver contributing to the widespread afternoon depression of photosynthesis in terrestrial vegetation globally. However, Earth System Models (ESMs) systematically underestimate the significant role of VPD in regulating photosynthesis. Eight out of 10 ESMs exhibited a clear afternoon increase in photosynthesis, which was attributed to temperature. Our findings emphasize the need to enhance the negative effects of VPD on diurnal photosynthesis in ESMs."

In this study, deep convection area (DCA) in East Asia is identified using the infrared channel of Geostationary Korea Multi‐Purpose Satellite‐2A (GK‐2A) over 49 months (from August 2019 to August 2023), and CIT is determined by using in situ aircraft data adjacent to the DCA. Based on the satellite‐based CIT algorithm, the results indicate that 13.85%, 15.65%, and 18.23% of the total turbulence cases are classified as CIT over the Korean Peninsula, East Asia, and the full‐disk area, respectively, which are consistent with those in the previous studies. In East Asia, the CIT ratio is the highest in summer primarily due to the East Asian summer monsoon, and surprisingly, it is the second highest in winter. In winter, DCA occurs along the storm tracks accompanied by Aleutian Low, which provides favorable conditions for flights to encounter CIT in the North Pacific Ocean. The CIT intensity decreases rapidly as the horizontal distance between the DCA boundary and CIT location increases. However, at a distance exceeding 40 km from the DCA boundary, the intensity of turbulence gradually increases, which is most significant in winter. This trend is more likely related to the broader areas of DCA in the winter season than those in summer mainly due to the stronger upper‐level jet and its interaction with a storm system. Eventually, this algorithm can provide better information of avoidance guidance for CIT over the ocean."

Prein;Hugh Morrison,Simulating Precipitation Efficiency Across the Deep Convective Gray Zone,"Precipitation efficiency (PE) relates cloud condensation to precipitation and thus reflects how much of the total atmospheric condensate reaches the surface as precipitation. Because the PE in convective storms is directly linked to their updraft and downdraft dynamics, it is a helpful metric to identify convective processes that influence precipitation. However, km‐scale model simulations do not properly resolve convective processes such as individual updrafts and entrainment, which raises the question if such simulations can accurately represent PE. Here, we present two methods to derive PE from standard model output because condensation is usually not available as an output variable. The first method estimates PE from the state variables vertical velocity, temperature, and pressure, whereas the second method estimates PE from ice water path (IWP) and precipitation. We validate the proposed methods with the explicitly calculated PE using a set of idealized Weather Research and Forecast model simulations of organized midlatitude convective storms at different horizontal grid spacings. We show that PE can be reliably estimated from state variables with an error of less than 5%, partly due to error cancellation effects. Additionally, PE can be simulated by km‐scale models within ∼15% accuracy compared to large‐eddy simulations (LESs). The IWP method is slightly less accurate with a stronger grid spacing dependency of the error, but since it is based on observable quantities, it allows for a validation of simulated PE with satellite observations. Finally, we analyze the grid spacing dependency of the climate change signal of PE and find that future decreases in PE in LESs are robustly captured by km‐scale models."

The increased concentration of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ in the upper atmosphere results in enhanced radiative cooling rates leading to the contraction of the upper atmosphere. Due to its long lifetime and large vertical gradient, CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ concentration is also influenced by large dynamic events. We report a startling case of variability in CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ density and its infrared radiative cooling rates in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere during a major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event. A counter‐intuitive connection between CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ density and resulting CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ radiative cooling has been observed during the 2009 major SSW event. The behavior of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ cooling rates during such a dramatic events draws attention to our current understanding of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ infrared cooling variation and its connection to changes in CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ concentration.

We are curious about what happens in the atmosphere during the intermediate months of April, May, and June. In this study, we use atmospheric heat source as an intermediate quantity to link the sea ice and precipitation, and aim to find the intermediate stations where atmospheric heat source can well link to both March Arctic sea ice and the JA precipitation in NEC. The stations can appear in different locations and different intermediate months. Lagged correlations are calculated to infer the response of the heat source to sea ice and the response of precipitation to the heat source. Results show that there exist two spatial‐temporal channels. The first is a direct path over high latitudes, with intermediate station appearing in April at a location between Arctic and NEC. The second is a circuitous path, with intermediate station appearing in June over the equatorial Indian Ocean, which can excite a wave train that finally affects the JA precipitation in NEC. The influence of March Arctic sea ice on the JA precipitation in NEC can be contributed jointly by these two temporal‐spatial channels."

 The NASA TROPICS mission encompasses a constellation of CubeSats equipped with microwave radiometers, dedicated to investigating tropical meteorology and storm systems. In a departure from traditional microwave sounders, the TROPICS Microwave Sounder (TMS) employs new frequencies at F-band near 118 GHz and features an additional G-band channel at 205 GHz. We have expanded the capabilities of the Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MiRS), a state-of-the-art one-dimensional variational (1DVAR) algorithm, for the retrieval of geophysical variables with the TROPICS Pathfinder early-phase data. Here we focus on assessing the retrieved precipitation in terms of rainfall and graupel. TROPICS captures well the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of Hurricane Ida and Super Typhoon Mindulle. TROPICS depicted the eyewall replacement cycle of Mindulle as it weakened and reintensified. The global precipitation distribution and dynamics are well represented by TROPICS. We compare TROPICS with other precipitation datasets, including Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) and Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) products. For example, when compared with GMI, MiRS TROPICS instantaneous precipitation yields a correlation coefficient of 0.5 and an RMSE of 2.0 mm/h. For graupel, MiRS TROPICS retrievals show a correlation of 0.52 and an RMSE of 0.53 kg/m2. The retrieval performance is comparable to other sensors such as the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), while the higher number of channels of ATMS, including its low-frequency channels serve to better constrain retrievals. TMS observes at higher spectral frequencies than the coincident ATMS channels, showing higher sensitivity to rainfall and graupel. The TMS high-frequency channels and lower orbit allow for greater resolution of precipitation features, while lower-frequency ATMS channels excel at resolving hurricane warm-core structures. The results underscore the value of the TROPICS mission for precipitation measurement and demonstrate the successful integration of TROPICS processing capability within the MiRS retrieval algorithm framework."

Cordero,Vertical structure and surface impact of atmospheric rivers reaching antarctic sea ice and land,"•Warm and moist air from ARs increases inversions in summer, while winter inversions are not likelier but occur further aloft. •Sea ice near the Antarctic coast buffers ARs by reducing winds and moisture, weakening them before landfall. •Turbulent fluxes matter year-round, but summer (winter) surface impacts are mainly driven by shortwave (longwave) anomalies. •Surface warming of ARs over sea ice is enhanced by upper-air subsidence in summer, and turbulent/longwave fluxes in winter. •Clouds drive the main downward longwave flux for ARs on land, while water vapor and shortwave anomalies are often reduced. 
 Recent extremes in Antarctic temperature, surface melt and sea ice loss have been robustly linked to the occurrence of atmospheric rivers (ARs). However, the precise mechanisms that generate variations in the surface impacts of ARs are poorly understood, especially in the Antarctic. Based on Arctic evidence that the vertical and horizontal advancement of ARs over sea ice strongly depends on meteorological conditions, the season, as well as the underlying surface before reaching sea ice, we investigate the vertical structure and impact of extreme ARs reaching sea ice and also the Antarctic ice sheet.Based on MERRA-2, ERA5 and six CMIP6 models (1985–2014), we find that surface inversions are twice as likely to occur during AR conditions in austral summer compared to climatology, and also find a significant increase in the frequency of double inversions. Our results suggest that land-locked sea ice acts as a protective barrier for the Antarctic continent, diminishing wind speeds and moisture levels, and that seasonal variations exhibit a predominant influence of downward shortwave and longwave flux anomalies in summer and winter, respectively. Furthermore, surface warming induced by ARs over sea ice is notably enhanced under conditions of upper-air subsidence, coupled with reduced cloud cover and precipitation in summer, and intensified turbulent heat and downward longwave fluxes in winter. By contrast, the surface warming associated with ARs reaching land is mainly caused by the cloud radiative effect, where the most intense ARs are further enhanced by positive downward sensible and latent heat fluxes."

Leveraging the ultralow cross-plane thermal conductivity and strong temperature-dependent excitonic resonances of 2D-MHPs, we demonstrate ambient-temperature, all-optical detection of MIR light with sensitivity down to 1 nanowatt per square micrometer, using plastic substrates. Through the adoption of membrane-based structures and a photonic enhancement strategy unique to our all-optical detection modality, we further improved the sensitivity to sub–10 picowatt-per-square-micrometer levels. The detection covers the mid-wave infrared regime from 2 to 4.5 micrometers and extends to the long-wave infrared wavelength at 10.6 micrometers, with wavelength-independent sensitivity response.

In particular, we aim to investigate if the dawn‐dusk asymmetries in Na+ $N{a}^{+}$ distributions near the equator can be driven by internal mechanisms within the magnetosphere. Our findings indicate that (a) the observed dawn‐dusk asymmetric Na+ $N{a}^{+}$ distributions can be driven by the separation of H+ ${H}^{+}$ and Na+ $N{a}^{+}$ flows, and (b) the Hall‐driven global convection preferentially transporting Na+ $N{a}^{+}$ ions to the morning sector."

We find that shortwave cloud radiative properties across the Southern Hemisphere extratropics are most robustly correlated with tropical cloud feedback (TCF). Using this relationship in conjunction with observations, we produce an EC that yields a TCF value of 0.52 ± 0.34 W/m2/K, which equates to a 34% reduction in uncertainty.

A proposed mechanism is changes in tropical lower stratospheric upwelling rates and static stability caused by QBO and solar UV effects on extratropical wave forcing of the stratospheric residual meridional circulation (the Brewer‐Dobson circulation). The extent to which this mechanism, which operates only in boreal winter and enhances similar effects of the QBO‐induced meridional circulation, is simulated in a series of GCMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) is investigated. The models are found to be often lacking complete representation of several elements of the mechanism, with particular issues being QBOs that are westerly biased and weak in the lower stratosphere, insufficient solar or QBO modulation of extratropical wave activity (the Holton‐Tan effect), too weak reductions in equatorial tropopause static stability in response to extratropical wave forcing, and MJOs that in some cases do not respond to these reductions. Through bypassing many of these deficiencies via data selection, it is demonstrated that effects on the MJO that resemble those found in observations (strengthening of the MJO following early winter sudden stratospheric warmings and during easterly QBO winters) can be simulated by a subset of the models. This supports operation of the proposed mechanism, and points to needed model improvements, although caveats exist and further work is needed."

In August 2022, unprecedented heatwaves struck central China and west Russia concurrently, resulting in severe energy crisis, numerous financial losses, and fatalities. Through synoptic‐scale analysis, we identify a pivotal role of recurrent Rossby wave packets (RRWPs) in shaping the event by repeatedly forming ridges and troughs over the same key areas. In this study, we further extend the investigation of the influence of RRWPs on heatwave occurrences in these two targeted regions over the past 44 years. Using a self‐organizing map to identify the RRWP patterns, we find that RRWPs with ridges over central China are closely associated with a marked increase in heatwave probabilities in both central China and western Russia. Specifically, the regional‐mean likelihood of heatwaves increases by factors of 3.0 and 2.6, respectively, relative to the climatology. Notably, the effect of RRWPs on the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves across both regions is more pronounced than on regional events alone. For example, during RRWPs, the likelihood of concurrent heatwaves affecting at least 20% of both target regions exceeds 10 times the climatological average. Our findings underscore the significant role of RRWPs in triggering concurrent Eurasian heatwaves and suggest promising synoptic predictability for such extreme events."

Observations are essential to evaluate and improve models of such processes. This study introduces a comprehensive validation framework for a satellite‐based detection algorithm of continental shallow cumulus (ShCu) clouds during the daytime, which was initially developed using ground‐based observations of stereo cameras at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains site (J. Tian, Zhang, Klein, & Schumacher, 2021, https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13122309, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021gl097070). To validate this algorithm, the framework employs ground‐based ceilometer measurements from North Alabama (NA) where ShCu populations are prevalent. This study first generates clear‐sky surface reflectance maps at NA and identifies ShCu pixels with a detection threshold using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) reflectance data. The obtained cloud fractions (CFs) are then compared against CFs from a ground‐based ceilometer, considering factors such as observed area differences, satellite parallax issue, and systematic biases. We found that with a detection threshold (∆R) of 0.05, the ShCu detection algorithm is effective for NA, enabling the reproduction of hourly ShCu CFs using GOES. Our framework is straightforward and easily repeatable to evaluate the effectiveness of a ∆R threshold for detecting ShCu clouds in various geographic regions where ceilometers are deployed. This satellite detection of ShCu provides a crucial regional context for ground‐based measurements, facilitating the tracking of convection initiation and its coupling with land surface conditions. Integrating localized ground‐based and regional satellite data will enhance our ability to conduct thorough studies of cloud morphology and land‐atmosphere interactions in North Alabama."

 Remote sensing of solar-induced vegetation chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has a rich history of more than 50 years of research covering active and passive techniques from leaf, canopy, and satellite scale. Current satellite-derived SIF products primarily focus on the far-red spectral range, with variations in techniques dependent on sensor capabilities. However, these retrieval methods often rely on parametric spectral models and are constrained to narrow absorption regions. In this paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian retrieval technique, referred to as SIFFI (Siffi Is For Fluorescence Inference), designed for the flexible and robust estimation of spectrally resolved fluorescence spectra. SIFFI utilizes spectral representations for both fluorescence and surface reflectance, enabling its application to distinct spectral ranges, e.g., red, far-red, and full spectral range. Also, its applicability extends to top-of-canopy (TOC) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurements, with the latter being possible when auxiliary information about the atmospheric state is available. For the assessment of SIFFI, we performed an extensive proof-of-concept simulation exercise involving diverse scenarios that integrated measured leaf-level fluorescence and reflectance signals, propagated them to the TOC and TOA levels, and perturbed the resultant signal with instrument Gaussian noise to simulate realistic conditions. Additionally, we extend our assessment exercise to TOC measurements acquired by a fluorescence box (FloX) instrument during two diurnal cycles on sunlit and cloudy conditions. In all the TOC cases, simulations- and measured-based scenarios, we compared our SIF estimates with the results from two well-established methods: the improved Fraunhofer line discrimination method (iFLD) and the Spectral Fitting (SpecFit) method covering the full fluorescence spectra. Notably, our results highlight the versatility and accuracy of SIFFI in estimating spectrally resolved fluorescence, achieving Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 0.07 (0.09) [mW/(m2srnm)] in the TOC (TOA) simulation scenarios, improving the SpecFit method estimates, and being aligned with the iFLD method results at the oxygen bands. SIFFI represents a significant advancement in SIF retrieval, providing a robust approach that exploits the full spectral information from the red to the near-infrared regions."

 Soil and vegetation temperatures are crucial for various fields, including ecology, agriculture, and climate change. However, there remains a lack of entirely observation-based global datasets for these two component temperatures. To fill this gap, this study developed a multisource data Fusion-based global surface Soil and Vegetation Temperature retrieval method (FuSVeT). This novel method not only utilizes temporal and spatial information from MODIS data by adopting a temperature cycle model to capture temporal variation and using adjacent pixels to consider spatial differences and increase the number of equations solved, but also leverages ERA5-Land data to reduce unknown parameters, effectively compensating for the limitations of satellite observations. Its performances were comprehensively evaluated with simulated data, high-resolution satellite products, and in situ measurements, demonstrating competitive accuracy with root mean square errors below 2 K and Biases of under 1 K in most cases. Compared to previous retrieval method that relies solely on satellite-based temporal and spatial information, FuSVeT present enhanced accuracy, more complete spatial coverage, and improved computational efficiency, making it more applicable for global soil and vegetation temperature mapping. Using this method, we generated global 0.05° monthly mean soil and vegetation temperatures for January and July 2020. These data can capture more pronounced temperature heterogeneities within biomes than existing soil temperature products, indicating its superiority for global analyses. Importantly, FuSVeT can also be applied to satellite observations with higher spatiotemporal resolution, holding significant potential for providing accurate, long-term, global maps of surface soil and vegetation temperatures."

 Brown Carbon (BrC) is an organic component of aerosols with light-absorbing characteristics that have crucial consequences in atmospheric warming and the climate system, yet it carries significant uncertainty. This uncertainty is due to its non-static optical properties which provide a significant challenge in the measurement of the perturbation caused by them in the Earth radiation budget. The unpredictability in optical properties is because of the continuous formation of Secondary BrC and decay of existing BrC influenced by various physicochemical and meteorological factors in the ambient atmosphere. The dynamic behaviour of these chromophores can be impacted by the aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and atmospheric acidity via influencing its atmospheric chemistry of formation and decay. The objective of this research is to investigate how the ALWC and acidity in terms of pH affect the BrC optical properties in the rarely examined Eastern part of India during extreme winters. Utilizing a thermal-optical carbon analyzer, the optical characteristics of BrC were estimated. The ISORROPIA II, thermodynamic model was employed to simulate ALWC and aerosol pH, yielding a mean pH value of 3.30 ± 0.16 for the study duration. The study provides the first in-field evidence of a linear increase of absorption coefficient with increasing pH or decreasing aerosol acidity in the ambient atmosphere. A 39.6 Mm−1 increase in absorption coefficient per unit increase in pH, shows that aerosol pH is one of the decisive elements influencing BrC chemistry. The results also showed the inverse relation of the absorption coefficient with ALWC. The findings indicate the sensitivity of BrC chemistry towards aerosol acidity and ALWC in the ambient atmosphere and its importance while evaluating BrC absorption."

A total of 4677 PMW and 3074 PR snapshots are matched with DP and non‐DP events of TCs objectively identified from infrared satellite images. The PMW observations suggest that compared to non‐DP events, the inner‐core (0–100 km) cold clouds containing both ice and liquid particles become more frequent and widespread when DP occurs. The greatest DP‐associated enhancement of cold clouds occurs in the downshear left quadrant of weak TCs (tropical storms) and in the upshear region of moderate‐to‐strong (≥ CAT 1) hurricanes, respectively. Also, the inner‐core cold clouds of DP events still maintain a relatively symmetric distribution under high‐shear (>10 ms−1) environments compared to non‐DP counterparts. The inner‐core warm cloud, dominated by liquid hydrometeors, increases in regions right of the shear but decreases left of the shear during DP events. Similarly, PR echo‐top height statistics show significant increases of moderate‐to‐deep convection in the TC inner region (0–300 km) on DP events especially for weak TCs. Particularly, the upshear‐right quadrant has the greatest increase in moderate‐to‐deep convection during DP events. These changes lead to a deeper and more symmetric convective structure of TCs' inner region with the occurrence of DPs."

 Light photometric and polarimetric characteristics are crucial for describing the optical properties of leaf reflections, which play an essential role in investigating biochemical and surface structural trait inversion and radiative balance between vegetation and atmospheric system. Although several physical models are available, research on a comprehensive model that accounts for both photometric and polarimetric characteristics and incorporates biochemical and surface structural traits is still inadequate. In this study, we introduced PROPOLAR, a leaf model that considered leaf reflection in terms of polarized and unpolarized components and linked leaf reflection to leaf traits. PROPOLAR employed PROSPECT to simulate non-polarized component associated with biochemical traits, while used a three-parameter function (linear coefficient, refractive index factor, and roughness of leaf surface) to simulate the polarized component. The model was validated using a dataset (composed of both photometric and polarimetric measurements) collected from 533 samples of 13 plant species under various illumination-viewing geometries. The results showed that PROPOLAR outperformed PROSPECT and PROSPECULAR (a leaf model charactering BRF) in simulating light intensity (R2 = 0.98), and effectively simulated bidirectional polarization reflectance factor (BPRF) and degree of linear polarization (Dolp) across a wide spectral range (450–2300 nm) and species, with R2 = 0.92, and 0.80, respectively. Furthermore, PROPOLAR enhanced the accuracy of PROSPECT and showed comparable accuracy with PROSPECULAR in the inversion of biochemical traits from the multi-angular polarization measurements, including chlorophyll (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 12.83 μg/cm2), equivalent water thickness (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.0032 g/cm2), and leaf mass per area (R2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.0031 g/cm2), due to the incorporation of polarization reflection and a linear coefficient during calibration. Notably, PROPOLAR can invert roughness and showed reasonable consistency with measured roughness (R2 = 0.61). These results demonstrated the effectiveness of PROPOLAR in simulating both photometric and polarimetric properties of leaf reflection, as well as its potential for biochemical and surface structural trait inversion. PROPOLAR may advance remote sensing applications in vegetation management by integrating photometric and polarimetric properties."

 The oxidative potential (OP) of airborne particulate matter (PM) is a valuable metric for assessing PM toxicity. Here we present an online system capable of measuring OP using the acellular dithiothreitol (DTT) assay with hourly resolution. The system consists of a particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS) as online sampling component, a solution distribution, mixing and heating module, and a detection module. Compared with existing automated systems described in the literature, our system is distinctly different in the design of the detection module. Our design is simpler, less expensive, and easier to maintain, thus more desirable for long-term field deployment. The improved features are realized through using a more durable visible light source and a simpler flow cell. Our system is tailored to achieve high analytical precision in measuring minute changes in light absorbance. The system provides a limit of detection of 0.027 μM/min or 0.84 nmol/min/m3, based on measurements of ambient blank samples. During a field deployment with hourly PM2.5 in the range of ∼2–31 μg/m3, it enables determination of 99.9% of hourly samples (N = 704) above detection limit. Compared to previous systems, our system provides comparable precision (CV = 2–8%) and better consistency with offline method (slope: 1.06, intercept: 0.02, R2: 0.99). We field-tested the system for one-month at a suburban site in Hong Kong. The average field blank corrected OP was 3.18 ± 2.20 nmol/min/m3, corresponding to ambient PM2.5 concentrations averaged at 10.5 ± 6.1 μg/m3. Over the PM2.5 mass range encountered, the relationship between OP and PM2.5 exhibited an increasing trend of OP with PM2.5 up to ∼13 μg/m3, after which it reached a plateau. Within a narrow PM2.5 mass bin of 5 μg/m3, considerable sample-to-sample variation in OP was observed. The system effectively captured a rapid rise in OP as the dominant wind direction shifted from southerly, bringing in clean marine air, to northerly, transporting polluted air. We have demonstrated the adequate sensitivity of our system for monitoring OP of ambient PM2.5 at an hourly resolution. By offering real-time measurements, this system has the potential to enhance our understanding of the dynamic nature of PM toxicity and its implications for human health."

Assimilated profiles positively impact the representation of air pollutants in the model by improving their vertical distribution and ground-level concentrations. This case study highlights the potential of drone data to enhance air quality analyses including local emission evaluation. 
 Vertical profiles of atmospheric pollutants, acquired by uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs, known as drones), represent a new type of observation that can help to fill the existing observation gap in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). This article presents the first study of assimilating air pollutant observations from drones to evaluate the impact on local air quality analysis. The study uses the high-resolution air quality model EURAD-IM (EURopean Air pollution Dispersion – Inverse Model), including the four-dimensional variational data assimilation system (4D-Var), to perform the assimilation of ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxide (NO) vertical profiles. 4D-Var is an inverse modelling technique that allows for simultaneous adjustments of initial values and emissions rates. The drone data were collected during the MesSBAR (automated airborne measurement of air pollution levels in the near-earth atmosphere in urban areas) field campaign, which was conducted in Wesseling, Germany, on 22–23 September 2021. The results show that the 4D-Var assimilation of high-resolution drone measurements has a beneficial impact on the representation of regional air pollutants within the model. On both days, a significant improvement in the vertical distribution of O3 and NO is noticed in the analysis compared to the reference simulation without data assimilation. Moreover, the validation of the analysis against independent observations shows an overall improvement in the bias, root mean square error, and correlation for O3, NO, and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) ground concentrations at the measurement site as well as in the surrounding region. Furthermore, the assimilation allows for the deduction of emission correction factors in the area near the measurement site, which significantly contributes to the improvement in the analysis."

In this study, we improved, updated and validated TOST from 1970 to 2021. Based on this TOST dataset, we characterized global ozone variations spatially in both the troposphere and stratosphere and temporally by season and decade. We also showed a stagnant lower stratospheric ozone variation since the late 1990s. 
 A global-scale horizontally and vertically resolved ozone climatology provides detailed insights into ozone variability. Here, the seasonal, annual and decadal monthly Trajectory-mapped Ozonesonde dataset for the Stratosphere and Troposphere (TOST) ozone climatology is improved and updated over 1970–2021. TOST is gridded at 5°×5°×1 km (latitude, longitude and altitude) from the surface to 26 km by the geometric coordinate and from the surface to 20 hPa at 26 pressure levels by the pressure coordinate, with the most recent ozonesonde data re-evaluated following the ASOPOS-2 guidelines (Smit and Thompson, 2021). Comparison between ozonesonde and trajectory-derived ozone shows good agreement for each decade, altitude and station, with relative differences (RDs) of 2 %–4 % in the troposphere and 0.5 % in the stratosphere. TOST also aligns well with aircraft, the Satellite Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) datasets. The updated TOST improves data coverage in all latitude bands and altitudes and reduces RD by 14 %–17 % compared to the previous version, taking advances in trajectory simulations and twice as many ozonesonde profiles. Higher uncertainties in TOST are where data are sparse, i.e., southern high latitudes, tropics and pre-1980s, and where variability is high, i.e., at the surface and upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS). Caution should therefore be taken when using TOST in these spaces and times.

Here, airborne measurements of clouds in mid-latitudes and high latitudes are used to study the spatial variability of ice. Further, we investigate the influence of riming, which occurs when liquid droplets freeze onto ice crystals. We find that riming enhances the occurrence of ice clusters. In the Arctic, riming leads to ice clustering at spatial scales of 3–5 km. This is due to updrafts and not higher amounts of liquid water. 
 Observations show that the ice water content (IWC) in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) tends to occur in clusters. However, it is not sufficiently understood which ice crystal formation and growth processes play a dominant role in IWC clustering in clouds. One important ice growth process is riming, which occurs when liquid water droplets freeze onto ice crystals upon contact. Here we use airborne measurements of MPCs at mid- and high-latitudes to investigate the spatial variability of ice clusters in clouds and how this variability is linked to riming. We use data from the IMPACTS (mid-latitudes) and the HALO-(AC)3 (high-latitudes) aircraft campaigns, where spatially and temporally colocated cloud radar and in situ measurements were collected. We derive riming and IWC by combining cloud radar and in situ measurements. Ice cluster scales in clouds are quantified using pair correlation functions.During all analyzed flight segments, riming is responsible for 66 % and 63 % of the total IWC during IMPACTS and HALO-(AC)3, respectively. In mid-latitude MPCs, riming does not significantly change IWC cluster scales but increases the probability of cluster occurrence. In cold-air-outbreak MPCs observed during HALO-(AC)3, riming leads to additional in-cloud IWC clustering at spatial scales of 3–5 km due to the presence of mesoscale updraft features. An increased liquid water path might increase the effect, but it is not a necessary criterion. These results can be used to evaluate and constrain models' representations of MPCs."

Understanding the factors that affect CCN estimations is essential to improve the CCN data coverage worldwide and assess aerosol–cloud interactions on a global scale. This is crucial for improving climate models, since aerosol–cloud interactions are the most important source of uncertainty in climate projections. 
 High-altitude remote sites are unique places to study aerosol–cloud interactions, since they are located at the altitude where clouds may form. At these remote sites, organic aerosols (OAs) are the main constituents of the overall aerosol population, playing a crucial role in defining aerosol hygroscopicity (κ). To estimate the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) budget at OA-dominated sites, it is crucial to accurately characterize OA hygroscopicity (κOA) and how its temporal variability affects the CCN activity of the aerosol population, since κOA is not well established due to the complex nature of ambient OA. In this study, we performed CCN closures at a high-altitude remote site during summer to investigate the role of κOA in predicting CCN concentrations under different atmospheric conditions. In addition, we performed an OA source apportionment using positive matrix factorization (PMF). Three OA factors were identified from the PMF analysis: hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), and more-oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), with average contributions of 5 %, 36 %, and 59 % of the total OA, respectively. This result highlights the predominance of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) with a high degree of oxidation at this high-altitude site. To understand the impact of each OA factor on the overall OA hygroscopicity, we defined three κOA schemes that assume different hygroscopicity values for each OA factor. Our results show that the different κOA schemes lead to similar CCN closure results between observations and predictions (slope and correlation ranging between 1.08–1.40 and 0.89–0.94, respectively). However, the predictions were not equally accurate across the day. During the night, CCN predictions underestimated observations by 6 %–16 %, while, during morning and midday hours, when the aerosol was influenced by vertical transport of particles and/or new particle formation events, CCN concentrations were overestimated by 0 %–20 %. To further evaluate the role of κOA in CCN predictions, we established a new OA scheme that uses the OA oxidation level (parameterized by the f44 factor) to calculate κOA and predict CCN. This method also shows a large bias, especially during midday hours (up to 40 %), indicating that diurnal information about the oxygenation degree does not improve CCN predictions. Finally, we used a neural network model with four inputs to predict CCN: N80 (number concentration of particles with diameter > 80 nm), OA fraction, f44, and solar global irradiance. This model matched the observations better than the previous approaches, with a bias within ± 10 % and with no daily variation, reproducing the CCN variability throughout the day. Therefore, neural network models seem to be an appropriate tool to estimate CCN concentrations using ancillary parameters accordingly."

Sayer;Meng Gao;James Hays;Judy Hoffman,3D cloud masking across a broad swath using multi-angle polarimetry and deep learning,"Measuring the shape of clouds helps scientists understand how the Earth will continue to respond to climate change. Satellites measure clouds in different ways. One way is to take pictures of clouds from multiple angles and to use the differences between the pictures to measure cloud structure. However, doing this accurately can be challenging. We propose a way to use machine learning to recover the shape of clouds from multi-angle satellite data. 
 Understanding the 3D structure of clouds is of crucial importance to modeling our changing climate. Both active and passive sensors are restricted to two dimensions: as a cross-section in the active case and an image in the passive case. However, multi-angle sensor configurations contain implicit information about 3D structure, due to parallax and atmospheric path differences. Extracting that implicit information requires computationally expensive radiative transfer techniques. Machine learning, as an alternative, may be able to capture some of the complexity of a full 3D radiative transfer solution with significantly less computational expense. In this work, we develop a machine-learning model that predicts radar-based vertical cloud profiles from multi-angle polarimetric imagery. Notably, these models are trained only on center swath labels but can predict cloud profiles over the entire passive imagery swath. We compare with strong baselines and leverage the information–theoretic nature of machine learning to draw conclusions about the relative utility of various sensor configurations, including spectral channels, viewing angles, and polarimetry. Our experiments show that multi-angle sensors can recover surprisingly accurate vertical cloud profiles, with the skill strongly related to the number of viewing angles and spectral channels, with more angles yielding high performance, and with the oxygen A band strongly influencing skill. A relatively simple convolutional neural network shows nearly identical performance to the much more complicated U-Net architecture. The model also demonstrates relatively lower skill for multilayer clouds, horizontally small clouds, and low-altitude clouds over land, while being surprisingly accurate for tall cloud systems. These findings have promising implications for the utility of multi-angle sensors on Earth-observing systems, such as NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) and Atmosphere Observing System (AOS), and encourage future applications of computer vision to atmospheric remote sensing."

The article details the optimization of the different elements of the instrument with simulations. This paper also presents a method to optimize laser angles for determining wind direction and strength and shows a 50 % improvement over the current angles used. 
 An architecture for a UV wind lidar dedicated to measuring vertical and lateral wind in front of an aircraft for gust load alleviation is presented. To optimize performance and robustness, it includes a fiber laser architecture and a Quadri Mach–Zehnder (QMZ) interferometer with a robust design to spectrally analyze the backscattered light. Different lidar parameters have been selected to minimize the standard deviation of wind speed measurement projected onto the laser axis, calculated through end-to-end simulations of the instrument. The optimization involves selecting an emission–reception telescope to maximize the number of collected photons backscattered between 100 and 300 m, a background filter to reduce noise from the scene, and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to minimize detection noise. Simulations were performed to evaluate lidar performance as a function of laser parameters. This study led to the selection of three laser architectures, a commercial solid-state laser, a design of a fiber laser, and a hybrid fiber laser, resulting in standard deviations of projected wind speed of 0.17, 0.16, and 0.09 m s−1, respectively, at 10 km altitude. To reconstruct the vertical and lateral wind on the flight path, the lidar is directed along four different directions to measure four different projections of the wind. We analytically calculate (and validate through simulations) the directed angle with respect to the flight direction that minimizes the root mean square error (RMSE) between the reconstructed vertical and lateral wind components and the actual ones, assuming turbulence that follows the von Kármán turbulence model. We found that the optimum angle for an estimation at 100 m is about 50°, resulting in an improvement of about 50 % compared to an angle of 15–30° typically used in current studies."

Deep storms co‐occur with relatively dry, unstable conditions, while wide storms are observed in moist, relatively stable environments. We identify eight large‐scale environmental variables that serve to distinguish between storm modes, and then show that principal component analysis can be used to condense this information into just two scalar variables. The methodology presented offers a succinct way to describe a storm's environment and will allow us to better relate a storm's initial environment to its dynamical characteristics."

To better understand the soil moisture (SM) dynamics happening synchronously in the soil column, we aim to estimate the rootzone (0–28 cm and 0–100 cm) CSM thresholds and associated regimes at a global scale, which was not previously attempted. We propose the use of the covariability of soil diurnal temperature amplitude (derived from the GLDAS) and SM (ERA5) to estimate the CSM, which overcomes the data uncertainty and multivariate dependencies of traditional methods. We find that transitional climatic regions, encompassing the western USA, Brazilian savanna, Sahelian grassland, South African savanna, peninsular India, and Mediterranean region, are global hotspots of frequent rootzone regime shifting with significant seasonality—the wet regime prevails in the fall season, while the dry regime takes over at other times of the year. The CSM values of 0–28 cm and 0–100 cm layers are mostly in the 0.2–0.35 and 0.25–0.4 m3m−3 range, respectively. We find that landscape aridity and bioclimatic characteristics primarily determine the spatial distribution of CSM and associated regimes. Furthermore, we investigate the hydrological link between the surface and rootzone layers. We note that the rootzone and surface CSM and regimes are strongly correlated, although the 0–28 cm layer indicates a relatively stronger connection compared to the 0–100 cm layer. The shallower (deeper) rootzone layer shows regimes similar to those on the surface for more than 80% (65%–80%) of the time. We observe that the strength of association between surface and rootzone regimes increases from arid (herbaceous vegetated regions) to humid (woody) regions and during wet to dry seasons. Overall, a strong association in regime dynamics between surface and subsurface layers suggests the potential applicability of remotely sensed surface SM as a surrogate to study rootzone regime responsiveness to soil–plant–atmosphere interactions."

By leveraging an existing open-access database of real-time congestion information derived from floating car data, we tested three methods to map high-resolution dynamic traffic emissions. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the methods, we showcased results for summer workdays and winter weekends in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA). The three methods employed include (1) a physics-based relation known as the macroscopic fundamental diagram, (2) a data-driven input-adaptive generalized linear model (GLM), and (3) their ensemble (ENS). These methods estimated traffic density with satisfactory accuracy (R2 = 0.60–0.88, sMAPE = 31%–68%). Utilizing speed-dependent emission factors retrieved from a European database, the results compared favorably against the downscaled national emission inventory, particularly for CO2 (R2 = 0.70–0.77). Among the three methods, GLM exhibited the best overall performance in the HMA, while ENS provided a robust upscaling solution. The modeled emissions exhibited dynamic diurnal and spatial behavior, influenced by different functional road classes, fleet compositions and congestion patterns. Congestion-induced emissions were calculated to account for up to 10% of the total vehicular emissions. Furthermore, to anticipate the forthcoming transportation transformation, we calculated emission changes under scenarios with various penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) using this geospatial approach.

This study investigates the impact of cloud radiation on TC seeds and TCs in an aquaplanet model by tuning ‘threshold diameter to convert cloud ice particles to snow’ (DCS). With increased cloud cover associated with higher DCS, seed frequency decreases, but the greater intensity increase of seeds leads to a higher survival rate from seeds to TCs. The changes in large-scale circulation within the models are responsible for the reduced seed frequency. Higher DCS enhances equatorial cloud liquid and ice amounts, thereby intensifying radiation heating to the tropics. Increased radiation leads to more moisture and higher temperatures at high levels and increases the temperature gradient from the tropics to the subtropics, thereby intensifying the Hadley circulation. The resulting decrease in convective available potential energy and intensification of vertical wind shear act as inhibiting factors for seed genesis. Besides, the presence of more high-level clouds accumulates both longwave and shortwave heating, creating favorable thermal conditions for the circulation to develop at the mesoscale. This process supports the growth of seeds into mature TCs, resulting in higher survival rates from seeds to TCs. The findings on TCs and CRE in aquaplanet models could serve as a foundation and provide evidence for studies conducted in more complex environmental conditions."

We combine these measurements with the SOFT-IO model to trace the origin of the observed CO. A comprehensive analysis of the geographical origin, source type, seasonal variation, and ozone levels of these pollution events is provided. 
 In situ measurements from the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) are used to characterise extreme values of carbon monoxide (CO) in large regions of the globe in the troposphere between 2002 and 2019. The SOFT-IO model, combining the FLEXPART Lagrangian dispersion model with emission inventories over the footprint region, is used to identify the origins of the CO in the sampled plumes. The impact of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions on such CO plumes is characterised through CO mixing ratios and simultaneously recorded ozone (O3) ones.In the Northern Hemisphere, CO reaches its maximum values in DJF in the lower troposphere, which can be attributed to elevated anthropogenic emissions and reduced convective activity during the season. Due to the low photochemistry and the fresh age of the air masses, the O3 values of these plumes are low. CO plumes in the upper troposphere (UT) result from intense emissions and efficient vertical transport, peaking during JJA. The largest values of CO in the Northern Hemisphere are found in eastern Asia in the lower troposphere (LT) and middle troposphere (MT) and in Siberia in the upper troposphere.Among the anomalies detected in  the upper troposphere in JJA, the ones with higher associated O3 values are the ones associated with biomass-burning emissions. The middle troposphere is a combination of the characteristics of the LT and the UT, with contributions from both local emissions and long-range transport. Among the studied regions, the troposphere above the Middle East and the UT above Siberia presented extremely high O3 values.Indian CO anomalies have different characteristics depending on the season, as the wet and dry phases of the monsoon have a strong impact on the transport of the pollutant in this region.Similarly, the shift in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) strongly impacts the seasonality of the emissions and the transport patterns above Africa. In that region, convection is no longer the limiting factor, and the transport of the CO plumes is driven by the ITCZ shift, trade winds, and the upper branch of the Hadley cell redistributing the pollution to higher latitudes."

Murray,High ice-nucleating particle concentrations associated with Arctic haze in springtime cold-air outbreaks,"Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) allow ice to form in clouds at temperatures warmer than −35°C. We measured INP concentrations over the Norwegian and Barents seas in weather events where cold air is ejected from the Arctic. These concentrations were among the highest measured in the Arctic. It is likely that the INPs were transported to the Arctic from distant regions. These results show it is important to consider hemispheric-scale INP processes to understand INP concentrations in the Arctic. 
 The global variation in ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations is an important modulator of the cloud-phase feedback, where the albedo of mixed-phase clouds increases in a warming climate. Shallow clouds, such as those observed in cold-air outbreaks (CAOs), are particularly important for cloud-phase feedbacks and highly sensitive to INPs. To investigate the sources and concentrations of INPs in CAOs, we made airborne measurements over the Norwegian and Barents seas as part of the March 2022 Arctic Cold-Air Outbreak (ACAO) field campaign. Aerosol samples were collected on filters at locations above, below and upstream of CAO cloud decks. Throughout the campaign, INP concentrations were comparable to the highest concentrations previously observed in the Arctic. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of samples taken upstream of cloud decks showed that supermicron aerosol was dominated by mineral dusts. Analysis of aerosol particle size measurements to obtain an INP active site density suggested sea spray was unlikely to be the dominant INP type. These site densities were also too great for mineral components alone to be the dominant INP type above −20 °C. Accordingly, it is likely that the dominant INP type was mineral dust mixed with other ice-nucleating materials, possibly of biogenic origin. Back-trajectory analysis and meteorological conditions suggested a lack of local INP sources. We therefore hypothesise that the high INP concentration is most likely to be associated with aged aerosol in Arctic haze that has undergone long-range transport from lower-latitude regions."
10.5194/acp-24-13961-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了大气中云的形成过程——rime（凝冻）如何影响大气成分的垂直分布。rime是指过冷水滴在冰粒表面冻结的过程。研究人员在美因茨的垂直风洞中进行了实验，模拟不同温度、液态水含量和pH值条件下的rime过程，测量了α-蒎烯氧化产物和硝基芳香化合物在rime过程中的滞留系数。结果表明，滞留系数与化合物的有效亨利定律常数之间存在相关性，高亨利定律常数的化合物更容易滞留在冰相中。这项研究有助于理解有机气溶胶在大气中的迁移转化过程，进而影响大气成分、云的形成和气候变化。 尽管论文本身没有直接涉及遥感技术，但其研究结果可以为大气成分的遥感观测提供重要的参数信息，例如不同类型有机气溶胶的垂直分布及其对云形成的影响。这些信息可以帮助改进大气模型和空气质量预测。,"['atmospheric composition', 'cloud processes', 'riming', 'organic aerosols', 'nitro-aromatic compounds', 'α-pinene oxidation products', 'retention coefficient', 'vertical distribution', 'air quality']",Christine Borchers;Jackson Seymore;Martanda Gautam;Konstantin Dörholt;Yannik Müller;Andreas Arndt;Laura Gömmer;Florian Ungeheuer;Miklós Szakáll;Stephan Borrmann;Alexander Theis;Alexander L. Vogel;Thorsten Hoffmann,Retention of α-pinene oxidation products and nitro-aromatic compounds during riming,"Riming, a crucial process in cloud dynamics, influences the vertical distribution of compounds in the atmosphere. Experiments in Mainz's wind tunnel investigated retention coefficients of organic compounds under varying conditions. Findings suggest a correlation between the Henry's law constant and retention, applicable even to complex organic molecules. 
 Riming is an important growth process of graupel and hailstones in the mixed-phase zones of clouds, during which supercooled liquid droplets freeze on the surface of ice particles by contact. Compounds dissolved in the supercooled cloud droplets can remain in the ice or be released to the gas phase during freezing, which might play an important role in the vertical redistribution of these compounds in the atmosphere by convective cloud processes. This is important for estimating the availability of these compounds in the upper troposphere, where organic matter can promote new particle formation and growth. The amount of organic material remaining in the ice phase can be described by the retention coefficient. Experiments were performed in the Mainz vertical wind tunnel under dry and wet growth conditions (temperature from −12 to −3 °C and a liquid water content (LWC) of 0.9±0.2 g m−3 and 2.2±0.2 g m−3) as well as with different pH values (4 and 5.6) to obtain the retention coefficients of α-pinene oxidation products and nitro-aromatic compounds. For cis-pinic acid, cis-pinonic acid, and (−)-pinanediol, mean retention coefficients of 0.96±0.07, 0.92±0.11, and 0.98±0.08 were obtained. 4-Nitrophenol, 4-nitrocatechol, 2-nitrobenzoic acid, and 2-nitrophenol showed mean retention coefficients of 1.01±0.07, 1.01±0.14, 0.99±0.04, and 0.21±0.12. Only the retention coefficient of 2-nitrophenol showed a dependence on temperature, growth regime, and pH. This is in accordance with previous studies, which showed a dependence between the dimensionless effective Henry's law constant H* and the retention coefficient for inorganic and small organic molecules. Our results reveal that this correlation can also be applied to more complex organic molecules and that retention under these conditions is not a significant factor for molecules with H* below 103, while retention close to 1 can be expected for compounds with H* above 108."

Luhar;Anthony C. Jones;Jonathan M. Wilkinson,Quantifying the impact of global nitrate aerosol on tropospheric composition fields and its production from lightning NOx,"Nitrate aerosol is often omitted in global chemistry–climate models, partly due to the chemical complexity of its formation process. Using a global model, we show that including nitrate aerosol significantly impacts tropospheric composition fields, such as ozone, and radiation. Additionally, lightning-generated oxides of nitrogen influence both nitrate aerosol mass concentrations and aerosol size distribution, which has important implications for radiative fluxes and indirect aerosol effects. 
 Several global modelling studies have explored the effects of lightning-generated nitrogen oxides (LNOx) on gas-phase chemistry and atmospheric radiative transfer, but few have quantified LNOx's impact on aerosol, particularly when nitrate aerosol is included. This study addresses two key questions: (1) how does including nitrate aerosol affect properties such as tropospheric composition, and (2) how do these effects depend on lightning parameterisation and LNOx levels? Using the Met Office's Unified Model–United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol (UM–UKCA) global chemistry–climate model, which now includes a modal nitrate aerosol scheme, we investigate these effects with two lightning-flash-rate parameterisations. Our findings show that both nitrate aerosol and LNOx significantly impact tropospheric composition and aerosol responses. Including nitrate aerosol reduces global mean tropospheric OH by 5 %, decreases the tropospheric ozone burden by 4 %–5 %, increases methane lifetime by a similar amount, and alters the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) net downward radiative flux by −0.4 W m−2. The inclusion of nitrate also shifts the aerosol size distribution, particularly in the Aitken and accumulation modes. A 5.2 Tg N yr−1 increase in LNOx from a zero baseline results in global aerosol increases of 2.8 % in NH4, 4.7 % in fine NO3, 12 % in coarse NO3, and 5.8 % in SO4 mass burdens. This much LNOx increase causes relatively small positive changes in aerosol optical depth, TOA radiative flux, and cloud droplet number concentration compared to when nitrate is included. The results, based on a fast uptake rate for HNO3 to produce NH4NO3, likely represent an upper limit on nitrate effects."

High-resolution measurements from a remote sensing laser instrument provide NLC height, brightness, and occurrence rate since 2017. Most observations occur in the morning hours, likely caused by strong tidal winds, and NLC ice particles are thus transported from elsewhere to the observing location in the Southern Hemisphere. 
 Noctilucent clouds (NLCs) are sensitive tracers of upper-mesospheric temperature, water vapor, and dynamics and thus open windows to study our atmosphere from very large to very small scales, including topics of climate, circulation, waves, and turbulence. NLCs are weaker in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere where there are numerous observations, but no vertical soundings at Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes were available until now. We determine the properties of NLCs above a Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude site at 53.8° S in southern Argentina. The Compact Rayleigh Autonomous Lidar has provided high-resolution vertical lidar soundings since 2017. Noctilucent clouds are detected every summer, with the earliest (latest) detection on 29 November (29 January), giving 19 events in total of 33.8 h length at an average height of 83.3 km, a maximum brightness of 24 × 10−10 m-1sr-1, an occurrence rate of 7 %, and a maximum in the morning hours (05:00–07:00 UTC, i.e., 02:00–04:00 LT). The latter coincides with a positive amplitude of the semi-diurnal tide of the meridional wind as measured by the Southern Argentina Agile Meteor Radar. The ambient temperature above the site is on average too high to support local ice formation. We find no correlation with the solar flux; indeed, the latest season of 2023/2024 shows the most NLC detections. This leaves transport from more southerly and colder regions and potentially increasing upper-mesospheric water vapor levels as a result of increasing space traffic as possible explanations for the occurrence and unexpectedly large brightness of NLCs above Río Grande."

Heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs), as major sources of these emissions, exhibit complex emission characteristics because of the combined effects of different driving conditions and aftertreatment technologies. This study first investigated the emission factors (EFs) of Nr species, including NO, NO2, HONO, N2O, and NH3, from HDDVs under different emission standards (China IV/V/VI) and cheating strategies, with a particular focus on the impact of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. Vehicles employing water injection cheating present NO, NO2, and HONO EFs that are consistent with the China III standards, significantly undermining the effectiveness of Nr emission control. The evolution of SCR technology in China IV, V, and VI standards has generally led to substantial reductions in NO, NO2, and HONO emissions, yet the integration of ammonia slip catalysts (ASC) systems in China VI vehicles presents new challenges. While ASCs have successfully reduced NH3 slip to an average of 17 ± 12 mg/km, they have also caused a 6–13-fold increase in N2O emissions compared with those of China IV and V vehicles, reaching levels of 205 ± 85 mg/km. Additionally, China VI vehicles exhibit a marked increase in the HONO/NOx ratio, which increases from 0.9% in China V to 4.6%. These increases are attributed to high-temperature oxidation of NH3 within the ASC catalyst, leading to undesirable byproducts. The temporal dynamics of Nr emissions under real-world driving conditions further reveal that the effectiveness of aftertreatment technologies and their selectivity toward byproducts vary depending on the driving mode. This variability underscores the need for further optimization of the SCR and ASC technologies to balance the control of all the reactive nitrogen species effectively."

Bottenheim;Yiwen Zhang;Xin Huang;Cong-Qiang Liu;Pingqing Fu,Dominance of Plastic Emission in the High Arctic Aerosol in Light Spring,"Arctic haze has attracted considerable scientific interest for decades. However, limited studies have focused on the molecular composition of atmospheric particulate matter that contributes to Arctic haze. Our study collected atmospheric particles at Alert in the Canadian high Arctic from mid-February to early May 2000. Over 100 organic species were identified in the solvent-extractable fraction by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, which were grouped by their functional groups. Plasticizer-derived phthalates were the most abundant, followed by polyacids, sugars, sugar alcohols, biogenic SOA tracers, and fossil fuel combustion tracers. During the dark winter, major contributors to Arctic aerosols include plastic emissions, biomass burning, secondary oxidation products, and fossil fuel combustion products. In the light spring, phthalates (58–76% of the identified organics) dominated, followed by microbial and marine sources and secondary oxidation products. By employing a tracer-based method, we discovered that naphthalene and sesquiterpene oxidation products were the major contributors to SOC, and these contributions were much higher in the winter than in the spring. However, monoterpene and isoprene oxidation products peaked in light spring. Our results confirm that organic aerosols in the Arctic atmosphere are dominated by anthropogenic sources, which consist of both long-range-transported particles and combustion-emitted organics, as well as aged anthropogenic secondary organic aerosols. Despite decreasing anthropogenic pollution being replaced by natural emissions, plastic-derived pollution, represented by phthalates, increased significantly in the high Arctic atmosphere after the polar sunrise."

Emission Factors and Revisiting Their Emissions in the Himalayan Regions,"Worldwide forest fires have occurred frequently in recent years, a result of which may be the emission of so-called “legacy” organochlorine pollutants (OCPs) accumulated in forests. However, few studies have measured the emission factors (EFs) of the toxicity of the OCPs from forest fires. In this study, the EFs of vegetation burning were observed in forests along the altitudinal gradient from 1000 to 4200 m, and the EFs of ∑DDTs (dechlorodiphenylthrichloroethanes), HCB (hexachlorobenzene), ∑HCHs (hexachlorocyclohexanes), and ∑PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were 2050 ± 1175, 379 ± 409, 48 ± 51, and 65 ± 59 ng/kg, respectively. Re-evaporation was the primary mechanism of the emission of OCP from forest fires. The masses of HCB, β-HCH, o,p′-DDD, p,p′-DDD, and PCB-28 in smoke increased 3–7 times compared with those in unburnt vegetation, suggesting the formation of these pollutants by the pyrolysis of biomass or other pollutants. Based on the observed EFs, previously estimated quantities of fire-emitted OCPs in the Himalayan regions were revisited. The DDT emissions from the Himalayan forest fires increased ∼70% compared with the previous estimation (from 19 to 32 kg/year). This highlighted that the EF observations could decrease the uncertainties of estimating OCP emissions from forest fires, which is helpful in revealing the potential roles of forest fires on global POP cycling."

Alvarez,Ambient Measurements of Hazardous Air Pollutants in the United States Routinely Exceed Predictions from Screening-Level Exposure Models,"Hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emission regulations in the US often rely on modeled estimates of ambient exposures. Model accuracy compared to real-world measurements of HAPs is crucial for understanding and mitigating exposure and associated health harms. While previous work shows ambient measurements are higher than regulatory model estimates, the implications for health risk assessments are rarely discussed. We provide a comprehensive comparison of the modeled and measured concentrations at 489 US monitoring sites for 79 HAPs. We quantify how model-measurement discrepancies affect the estimation of the exposure and risk of adverse health effects. Measurements were higher than modeled concentrations in 74% of comparisons over all monitors, chemicals, and years assessed, with measurements a median 2 (IQR 1–9) times higher than model estimates. Measurements exceeded noncancer adverse health effect thresholds, while the model did not (model false negatives) for nine pollutants. Adjusting for model bias in two industrial centers, we found the number of people with multipollutant exposure above the US EPA’s acceptable excess lifetime cancer risk increased by a factor of 30 times in Houston, Texas, and 13 times in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Our results imply that assessments relying exclusively on models like those we evaluated likely underestimate the spatial extent and magnitude of health hazards and risk."
10.1029/2024JD042294,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了城市化对中尺度对流系统（MCSs）的影响，特别是行星边界层（PBL）的作用。研究使用了北京的高密度雷达风廓线仪（RWP）探空网、风云二号静止气象卫星数据、理论分析和大涡模拟等多种手段。研究发现，强降水条件下，MCS在城市及下风向区域趋于减弱；弱降水条件下，MCS在城市及下风向区域则趋于增强。这种差异与城市地区的湍流摩擦和热力效应有关。强降水时，湍流摩擦减弱了MCS活动；弱降水时，热力效应占主导，促进了地表辐合，增强了MCS。论文的结论是通过理论分析和模型模拟证实了观测到的城市化对MCSs的影响，并强调了RWP探空网在研究城市化对MCSs影响中的重要性。,"['Mesoscale Convective Systems', 'Urbanization', 'Radar Wind Profiler', 'Satellite Observations', 'Precipitation', 'Planetary Boundary Layer', 'Turbulence', 'Large-Eddy Simulation', 'Fengyun-2']",Tian Xian;Jianping Guo;Runze Zhao;Xiaoran Guo;Ning Li;Yuping Sun;Zhen Zhang;Tianning Su;Zhanqing Li,"Impact of Urbanization on Mesoscale Convective Systems: Insights From a Radar Wind Profiler Mesonet, Theoretical Analyses, and Model Simulations","The role of planetary boundary layer (PBL) in the urban effect on mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) remains highly uncertain. The high‐density Mesonet of radar wind profilers (RWPs) in Beijing, along with geostationary satellite data from Fengyun‐2, were used to investigate the MCS evolution and potential impact of urbanization. An MCS as observed by satellite tends to weaken over urban and downstream areas under strong precipitating conditions as opposed to an invigorated MCS over urban and downstream areas under weak precipitating conditions. The pattern of low‐level convergence and high‐level divergence from RWP Mesonet dominates the PBL of all MCS events under strong precipitating conditions, as compared with fluctuating vertical structures of convergence under weak precipitating conditions. Under strong precipitating conditions, turbulent friction weakens MCS activity over the Beijing urban area. Under weak precipitating conditions, thermal effect dominated over urban areas, favoring the formation of surface‐level convergence and invigorating MCSs. Using the large‐eddy simulation, we further investigated the influence of turbulent structural characteristics on the development of MCS. For the strong (weak) precipitating case, turbulence dissipation (buoyancy) dominated the turbulent kinetic energy over urban areas, explaining well the characteristics of MCSs propagating over these areas. Overall, the theoretical analysis and model simulation results confirm the observed impact of urbanization on MCSs. Besides the above scientific findings, our study highlights the importance of the RWP Mesonet in studying the urban effect on MCSs."

The water vapor sources and transport paths of this rainstorm are still puzzling due to the insufficient representation of physical processes in previous analytical models, leading to possible deviations from reality. Here, using the online Eulerian Weather Research and Forecasting model with water vapor tracer (WRF‐WVT), we aim for an improved understanding of water vapor sources of the rainfall event. Results demonstrate that the most important water source for this event is water vapor from local evapotranspiration, contributing to 32.77% of the rainstorm moisture. Water vapor from Upstream Westerlies (28.95%) and East Asian Drylands (28.54%) are transported over the precipitation area by the westerlies owing to the strong lower‐level low‐pressure system, being the second‐most important precipitation source. These sources contribute significantly more than other regions, including the Arabian Sea (5.56%), the Tibetan Plateau (2.16%), and the South Asian Monsoon (0.77%). External moisture sources collectively provide over 65.98% of the precipitation, underscoring their important role. Notably, local evapotranspiration significantly influences precipitation, exceeding the contributions from other individual sources. By comparing with the 2016 precipitation event, it is found that a low‐pressure trough extending southward to the west of the TD plays a significant role in the 2021 rainstorm event. The presence of the trough significantly enhances the moisture transport of the westerlies and the upward motion, contributing to the occurrence of extreme precipitation events."

The total (Σ52) VOC levels at industrial sites (214 μg/m3), particularly in petrochemical, automobile, and shipbuilding industrial complexes, were higher than at rural (50.2 μg/m3) and urban (65.0 μg/m3) sites during the passive sampling period, with no significant diurnal variation during the active sampling period. On the other hand, isoprene, a representative biogenic VOC, was observed at higher concentrations at the rural sites, particularly during the daytime under favorable meteorological conditions. Furthermore, potential impacts from industrial emissions of isoprene were identified. Non-traffic sources (industrial activities) were dominant in the study area, while the rural and urban sites were more affected by traffic and aged sources. Aromatic compounds, especially toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p,o-xylenes, were significant contributors to both ozone formation potential (OFP) and SOA formation potential (SOAFP). In addition to aromatics, higher OFPs of n-octane and 3-methylpentane were also observed at the industrial sites. This study highlights the critical role of industrial complexes in determining the levels and spatial distribution of VOCs and their secondary products."

 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a concern due to their human health risks and secondary reactions, which vary according to the physicochemical properties and photochemical reactivity of individual VOCs. In this study, 59 VOCs were monitored using passive air samplers at 5 industrial and 16 urban sites in Ulsan, the largest industrial city in South Korea, over the course of a week (July 28–August 4, 2021). During the sampling period, toluene (4.6 μg/m3), ethylbenzene (3.2 μg/m3), and m,p,o-xylenes (8.5 μg/m3) accounted for 56.9% of the total (Σ59) VOCs. Elevated concentrations of Σ59 VOCs were observed in the automobile and shipbuilding industrial complexes, as well as at urban sites near the industrial complexes, due to dominant southeasterly winds. Toluene/benzene ratios indicated that fuel evaporation and solvent use were dominant during this warm sampling period. Benzene and naphthalene exhibited the highest mean cancer and non-cancer risks, respectively; however, none of the risks exceeded the US EPA's tolerable and acceptable safety levels. Furthermore, secondary organic aerosol formation potentials (SOAFPs) of VOCs were estimated, with toluene contributing the most. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence analysis suggested that styrene was closely related to PM2.5 formation. Finally, priority lists of the top 10 VOCs based on their concentrations, risks, and SOAFPs were created, and aromatic compounds were frequently found on the lists. Based on these findings, customized management strategies for VOC reduction are recommended in multi-industrial cities."

 An increasing evidence has suggested that organic aerosols (OA) may exist in a semisolid or solid state under specific ambient conditions rather than liquid as normally assumed in traditional gas-particle partitioning models, provoking a rethinking of viscosity-related atmospheric physicochemical processes of OA. Several detection methods and prediction models were developed to determine the OA viscosity, and the prediction with aerosol chemical compositions and molecular properties also provides effective means for viscosity quantification. The viscosity variations of OA depend on chemical properties and environmental conditions, e.g., temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH). The strong hydrogen bonding and formation of high molecular weight oligomers can significantly increase the OA viscosity. The higher RH introduces more aerosol liquid water that can serve as a plasticizer, and a higher T can enhance the breaking of intermolecular bonds, thereby decreasing the viscosity of OA. These combined impacts further result in highly spatiotemporal variability of OA viscosity. The lower diffusivity within more viscous OA particles is expected to preclude evaporation, water uptake, and gas uptake, leading to non-equilibrium gas-particle partitioning and shifting the partitioning mechanism from absorptive to adsorptive. The higher viscosity can also decelerate the heterogeneous reaction, thereby inhibiting OA formation and growth, extending atmospheric lifetimes of OA. Besides, a high viscosity allows OA particles to remain glassy, increasing the probability of heterogeneous ice nucleation, which further affects cloud properties and the global climate. The application of existing viscosity measurement techniques to ambient particles and improvement in the accuracy of viscosity prediction models are critical for future studies on OA-relevant atmospheric physicochemical processes. Given the significant impacts of OA viscosity on both atmospheric lifetimes of toxic pollutants and radiative properties of cirrus clouds, it is recommended that variations of OA viscosity should be considered in human-health-related risk assessments and climate models to improve their performance."

 In coastal areas like Mumbai, India, where heavy monsoons rain can lead to severe flooding, particularly in low-lying areas, it is essential to have accurate hourly rainfall estimations for meteorological and hydrological purposes. The Satellite Precipitation Products (SPPs), such as IMERG, provide comprehensive coverage, though they have biases. This research uses high-density ground-based rain gauges over Mumbai in real-time. It applies various correction methods to correct satellite precipitation estimates for a whole monsoon region on an hourly basis. The additive and multiplicative corrections in traditional parametric methods were ineffective, particularly during heavy rainfall conditions. Quantile mapping did well with negative biases but struggled with extreme rainfall events. The machine learning method called the Random Forest (RF) algorithm performed best by enhancing the correlation between satellite and ground-based data (overall) from 0.11 to 0.69. The RF model successfully reduced overestimation and underestimation and shifted towards zero bias, capturing the space and time variation of rainfall well across different stations. The study implies that ML can be used to enhance satellite precipitation products as an effective way to improve rainfall estimates in monsoon-prone areas. The application of the RF framework is likely to lead to more precise information for effective water resource management as well as disaster preparedness."

This transport is not well understood, and the role of rapidly rising air is unclear. We simulate a WCB and look at fast- and slow-rising air to see how moisture is (differently) transported. We find that for fast-ascending air more ice particles reach higher into the atmosphere and that frozen cloud particles are removed differently than during slow ascent, which has more water vapour. 
 Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) are coherent ascending airstreams in extratropical cyclones. They are a major source of moisture for the extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), where moisture acts as a potent greenhouse gas and WCB-associated cirrus clouds contribute to cloud radiative forcing. However, the processes controlling WCB moisture transport and cloud properties are poorly characterised. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed (embedded) convection as a ubiquitous feature of WCBs, highlighting the importance of understanding their updraught and microphysical structure. We present a Lagrangian investigation of WCB moisture transport for a case from the WISE (Wave-driven ISentropic Exchange) campaign based on a convection-permitting simulation. Lagrangian non-dimensional metrics of the moisture budget suggest that the ascent timescale (τ600) strongly controls the end-of-ascent total moisture content, which is largest for slowly ascending trajectories (τ600≥20 h, 30 % of all WCB trajectories). This is due to relatively warm end-of-ascent temperatures and the strong temperature control on transported water vapour. Deviations from equilibrium water vapour condensate partitioning are largest for slow trajectories due to faster glaciation and lower ice crystal numbers. A local moisture transport minimum at intermediate τ600 results from a shift towards a riming-dominated precipitation formation pathway and decreasing outflow temperatures with decreasing τ600. The fastest trajectories (τ600≤5 h, 5 % of all WCB trajectories) transport the largest condensate mass to the UTLS due to less efficient condensate loss and produce the longest-lived outflow cirrus clouds. Models that parameterise convection may under-represent these processes, potentially impacting weather forecasts and climate predictions."

We simulate satellites in various orbits to investigate how well they sample the imbalance and find that the best option is to combine at least two satellites that see complementary parts of the Earth and cover the daily and annual cycles. This information is useful when planning future satellite missions. 
 The Earth's energy imbalance, i.e. the difference between incoming solar radiation and outgoing reflected and emitted radiation, is the one quantity that ultimately controls the evolution of our climate system. However, despite its importance, there is limited knowledge of the exact magnitude of the energy imbalance, and the small net difference of about 1 W m−2 between two large fluxes (approximately 340 W m−2) makes it challenging to measure directly. There has recently been renewed interest in using wide-field-of-view radiometers on board satellites to measure the outgoing radiation, as a possible method for deducing the global annual mean energy imbalance. Here we investigate how to sample in order to correctly determine the global annual mean imbalance and interannual trends, using a limited number of satellites. We  simulate satellites in polar (90° inclination), sun-synchronous (98°) and precessing orbits (73, 82°), as well as constellations of these types of satellite orbits. We find that no single satellite provides sufficient sampling, both globally and of the diurnal and annual cycles, to reliably determine the global annual mean. If sun-synchronous satellites are used, at least six satellites are required for an uncertainty below 1 W m−2. One precessing satellite combined with one polar satellite results in root-mean-square errors of 0.08 to 0.10 W m−2, and a combination of two or three polar satellites results in root-mean-square errors of 0.10 or 0.04 W m−2, respectively. In conclusion, at least two satellites that complement each other are necessary to ensure global coverage and achieve a sampling uncertainty well below the current estimate of the energy imbalance."

Its data has improved weather forecasting, with Mie-cloudy winds proving especially precise. Challenges emerged, such as unexpected misalignments in signal angles and reduced signal levels due to beam clipping and laser issues. Lessons from Aeolus highlight the need for better optical alignment and active control systems for future lidar missions. 
 This paper presents an extensive investigation of the signal fringe profile for the Fizeau interferometer used in the first spaceborne wind lidar Aeolus, and considers the fundamental implications for the wind measurement accuracy in Aeolus and future systems. The early Aeolus design phase considered that the basic fringe would be made up of a Fizeau instrumental component of ≈ 100 MHz (FWHM), folded with the laser pulse spectral width of ≈ 50 MHz (FWHM), both of Lorentzian form. Fringe anomalies observed before the mission and related to surface defects in the interferometer plates, triggered the development of wave-optic methods for analysis of the fringe formation. These methods, herein described in an instructional Appendix, were subsequently found to be essential for rigorous modelling of complex fringes for different physical and optical arrangements. Initial signal returns from Aeolus suggested that the Fizeau fringe profile was in fact broadened with a large Gaussian component. The laser pulse was subsequently shown to have a profile close to Gaussian of ≈ 45 MHz (FWHM) and thus provided a partial contribution. However, detailed examination of experimental Aeolus fringes constructed from ground return signals, showed a large Gaussian component up to ≈ 130 MHz (FWHM). Wave-optic modelling established that Fizeau ""aperture broadening"", of this form and magnitude, would be generated for the input signal beam of 500 µrad field of view set at large angles of incidence of 300 µrad. These findings have strong implications for fringe shift and wind measurement accuracy, as given in the quantum limited Cramer-Rao expression and the paramount importance of minimising line width. Extensive modelling and simulation for the broadened profiles calculated above, shows good agreement with measured Aeolus global wind measurement accuracies, and indicates that loss of signal could be due to beam clipping at the field stop for such large AOI. It is established that optimisation of the present Aeolus Fizeau parameters could lead to a factor of 2.5 improvement in wind measurement precision. Future upgrades of the Fizeau interferometer and the laser within reasonable parameters, suggest the potential for an factor of 7.6 improvement on the present performance."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) are powerful weather systems that can cause extreme disasters. The International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) dataset provides widely used data to estimate TC climatology. However, it has low data coverage, lacking intensity and outer-size data for more than half of all recorded storms, and is therefore insufficient as a reference for researchers and decision makers. To fill this data gap, we reconstruct a long-term TC dataset by integrating IBTrACS and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) data. This reconstructed dataset covers the period 1959–2022, with 3 h temporal resolution. Compared to the IBTrACS dataset, it contains approximately 3–4 times more data points per characteristic. We establish machine learning models to estimate the maximum sustained wind speed (Vmax) and radius of maximum wind (Rmax) in six basins for which TCs are generated, using ERA5-derived 10 m azimuthal mean azimuthal wind profiles as input, with Vmax and Rmax data from the IBTrACS dataset used as learning target data. Furthermore, we employ an empirical wind–pressure relationship and six wind profile models to estimate the minimum central pressure (Pmin) and outer size of the TCs, respectively. Overall, this high-resolution TC reconstruction dataset demonstrates global consistency with observations, exhibiting mean biases of <1 % for Vmax and 3 % for Rmax and Pmin in almost all basins.

The results show generally good consistency of POSP products with AERONET, VIIRS/NOAA-20 aerosol dataset and MODIS surface product. Moreover, it is possible to conclude the developed POSP product includes reliable estimates of not only total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), but also detailed properties of aerosol such as aerosol size, absorption, layer height, type, etc., as well as full surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Function (BPDF), and black-sky, white-sky albedos and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These parameters are of high importance to constrain the Earth-atmosphere radiation budget. The retrieval of these properties seems to be possible due to the polarimetric capabilities and wide UV-VIS-NIR-SWIR spectral range of from POSP observations and advances of used GRASP/Models retrieval approach.

10.5194/gmd-17-8885-2024,True,Geoscientific Model Development,这篇论文研究了多环芳烃（PAHs）的全球和区域分布，以及中国2013年至2018年PAHs健康风险的变化。研究人员开发了一个名为IAP-AACM_PAH v1.0的全球-区域嵌套大气气溶胶和化学模型，模拟PAHs的分布，并用苯并[a]芘（BaP，PAHs的典型指示物种）的观测数据对模型进行了评估。结果表明，该模型能够较好地捕捉BaP的空间分布和季节变化。研究发现，全球PAHs年均浓度最高的地区是中国，其次是欧洲和印度，部分地区超过了1 ng m-3的目标值。中国的BaP浓度在2018年有所下降，这归因于排放量的减少，但降幅远小于PM2.5。尽管实施了行动计划，但中国仍然面临着BaP带来的重大潜在健康风险。该研究强调了在评估排放变化对浓度监测的影响时，考虑气象条件变化的重要性，并建议采取更严格的额外控制措施以有效降低PAHs的污染和健康风险。,"['Air Quality', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'PAHs', 'PM2.5', 'BaP', 'Health Risk Assessment', 'Modeling', 'Emission Control']",Zichen Wu;Xueshun Chen;Zifa Wang;Huansheng Chen;Zhe Wang;Qing Mu;Lin Wu;Wending Wang;Xiao Tang;Jie Li;Ying Li;Qizhong Wu;Yang Wang;Zhiyin Zou;Zijian Jiang,Modeling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from global to regional scales: model development (IAP-AACM_PAH v1.0) and investigation of health risks in 2013 and 2018 in China,"We developed a model to simulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from global to regional scales. The model can reproduce PAH distribution well. The concentration of BaP (indicator species for PAHs) could exceed the target values of 1 ng m-3 over some areas (e.g., in central Europe, India, and eastern China). The change in BaP is lower than that in PM2.5 from 2013 to 2018. China still faces significant potential health risks posed by BaP although the Action Plan has been implemented. 
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) significantly impact human health due to their persistence, toxicity, and potential carcinogenicity. Their global distribution and regional changes caused by emission changes, especially over areas in developing countries, remain to be understood along with their health impacts. This study implemented a PAH module in the global–regional nested Atmospheric Aerosol and Chemistry Model of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP-AACM) to investigate the global distribution of PAHs and the change in their health risks from 2013 to 2018 in China. An evaluation against observations showed that the model could capture well the spatial distribution and seasonal variation in Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), the typical indicator species of PAHs. On a global scale, the annual mean concentrations are the highest in China followed by Europe and India, with high values exceeding the target values of 1 ng m−3 over some areas. Compared with 2013, the concentration of BaP in China decreased in 2018 due to emission reductions, whereas it increased in India and southern Africa. However, the decline is much smaller than for PM2.5 during the same period. The concentration of BaP decreased by 8.5 % in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) and 9.4 % in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). It even increased over areas in the Sichuan Basin due to changes in meteorological conditions. The total incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) posed by BaP only showed a slight decrease in 2018, and the population in east China still faced significant potential health risks. The results indicate that strict additional control measures should be taken to reduce the pollution and health risks of PAHs effectively. The study also highlights the importance of considering changes in meteorological conditions when evaluating emission changes from concentration monitoring."

Recent studies have shown that reactive chlorine can rapidly oxidize volatile organic compounds (VOCs), trigger SOA formation, and alter other oxidants, thus having a potentially significant effect on SOA, which has not been thoroughly investigated at the global scale. Here, we developed a chlorine-SOA simulation within a global chemical transport model along with updated anthropogenic continental chlorine emissions. Our simulations demonstrate that chlorine chemistry increases the annual mean boundary layer SOA by 5–12% over most continents while decreasing SOA by 5–11% over northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which are in the right direction to narrow existing discrepancies between models and observations. Notably, sensitivity simulations in China with observed high chlorine levels capture the temporal variations of both observed fine Cl– and organic aerosol, showing an increase in SOA by more than 100%. Our study also reveals that polluted regions, which have ample emissions of both chlorine species and VOCs, exhibit potential chlorinated SOA, which are commonly toxic, contributing up to 15% to total SOA."

Abbatt,Ultrafine Particle Generation from Ozone Oxidation of Cannabis Smoke,"Cannabis smoke is a complex aerosol mixture, featuring characteristic monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes which are susceptible to reaction with ozone and other oxidants. These reactions form less-volatile species which can contribute to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and ultrafine particle (UFP) formation. In this work, the reaction of ozone with cannabis smoke was observed in an environmental chamber. Particle size distribution, and gas-phase and particle-phase composition were monitored in real time. The diameter of primary particles ranged from 10–1 to 1 μm. Ultrafine particle formation occurred when cannabis smoke was exposed to ozone levels greater than 10 ppb, over the entire observed primary particle concentration range (1030–4580 μg m–3). Gas-phase measurements indicate that monoterpene and sesquiterpene levels decayed rapidly upon ozone exposure, while oxygen-containing species were formed during oxidation. On the other hand, measurements of particle composition showed an increase in nitrogen-containing species during oxidation. Although ozone was the only oxidant added to cannabis smoke in the chamber, it is believed that the OH radical plays an important role in the oxidation mechanism, where OH results from the reaction of ozone with terpenes and sesquiterpenes. Overall, smoking cannabis in ozone-rich environments, both indoors and outdoors, will likely lead to UFP formation."

Thus, there is a need to better understand contaminant movement and human exposure to wildfire smoke. Vapor-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are elevated during wildfires, but little is known about how these chemicals move during and after wildfire events for exposure risk assessment. Paired air and soil pore air passive samplers were deployed before, during, and after wildfires to determine diffusive flux of vapor-phase parent (p-PAH) and alkylated (a-PAH) PAHs in the Western United States. Naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene contributed to most of the volatilization and deposition (6.3–89%) before and after a wildfire. Retene (41%) and phenanthrene (27%) contributed substantially to deposition during a wildfire. During wildfires, the number of PAHs in deposition increased at sites with worse air quality. Most p-PAHs and a-PAHs were either depositing or near equilibrium after a wildfire, except for retene at several locations. A majority (≥50%) of PAHs had a 50% magnitude difference between flux before and after a wildfire. This study increases the understanding of PAH movement and exposure during each stage of the wildfire cycle."

We study changes to high cloud radiative heating in a warmer climate, identify physical mechanisms responsible for these changes, and develop a theory based on well‐understood physics to predict them. Our approach involves a stepwise procedure that builds upon a simple hypothesis of an upward shift in cloud radiative heating at constant temperature and gradually incorporates additional physics.

Reliable MO data sets of air temperature (Ta), water vapor density (WVD) and relative humidity (RH) with high spatio‐temporal resolution over the TP were obtained and assimilated to improve precipitation forecast using the four‐dimensional variational (4DVAR) data assimilation (DA) method. The results show that Ta, WVD and RH profile data retrieved with the mobile microwave radiometer (MR) are credible over the TP. The atmospheric vertical structure measured by the mobile MR can reproduce the spatio‐temporal evolution characteristics of water vapor transport, temperature stratification and cloud structure. The distribution pattern of 24‐hr accumulated rainfall prediction with Ta profile DA was closer to measurements, and 6–12 hr forecasts for low to moderate rainfall in the central and western regions of Qinghai province were improved significantly. Data assimilation with air temperature retrievals from mobile MR observations were found beneficial for accurate simulation of water vapor transport, convergence and divergence of wind field, and upward motion associated with precipitation events.

Lora,Atmospheric rivers cause warm winters and extreme heat events,"Seasons with more frequent atmospheric rivers (ARs) also have warmer than average temperatures in many mid-latitude regions, and AR events are associated with temperature anomalies of 5–10 °C above the climatological mean. 
 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow regions of intense water vapour transport in the Earth’s atmosphere. These transient phenomena carry water from the subtropics to the mid-latitudes and polar regions1,2, making up the majority of polewards moisture transport3–5 and exerting control on the precipitation and water resources in many regions6,7. In addition to transporting moisture, ARs also transport heat, but the impact of this transport on global near-surface air temperatures has not yet been characterized. Here we show that seasons with more frequent ARs also have warmer than average temperatures in many mid-latitude regions, and that AR events are associated with temperature anomalies of 5–10 °C above the climatological mean. This is due to anomalous horizontal transport and convergence of sensible heat and moisture in the lower atmosphere, which increases both downward sensible heat flux and downwelling long-wave radiation at the surface. On an hourly timescale, over 70% of extreme warm-temperature anomalies occur within ARs in large portions of the mid-latitudes, and ARs are associated with moist and compound heatwaves in many regions worldwide, suggesting that consideration of ARs may improve predictive capability for certain extreme heat events. Our results demonstrate that ARs significantly impact air temperatures on a wide array of timescales, and that they may play a wider role in global energy transport than previously recognized. Seasons with more frequent atmospheric rivers (ARs) also have warmer than average temperatures in many mid-latitude regions, and AR events are associated with temperature anomalies of 5–10 °C above the climatological mean."

 Recent Antarctic sea-ice decline is a substantial source of concern, notably the record low in 2023 (ref. 1). Progress has been made towards establishing the causes of ice loss1–5 but uncertainty remains about its consequences for ocean–atmosphere interaction. Resolution of this uncertainty is important as ice decline can substantially alter surface heat loss and thus the ocean and atmosphere6. Here we show that the strongest winter 2023 ice-retraction regions provide an important new source of turbulent ocean heat loss to the atmosphere in wintertime. Ice concentration in these regions (located primarily in the Weddell, Bellingshausen and Ross seas) is reduced by up to 80% and is accompanied by an unprecedented doubling of mid-winter ocean heat loss. Also, there is a phase shift in the time of peak heat loss from late April to mid-June, with weaker than normal heat loss in austral autumn. The winter surface-heat-loss intensification is accompanied by substantial changes on both sides of the ocean–atmosphere interface. These include increases in atmospheric-storm frequency and surface-heat-loss-driven dense water formation, although the implications of the densification for broader processes such as Antarctic bottom water formation remain unclear. Our results reveal that the 2023 Antarctic sea-ice loss has substantially modified air–sea interaction in the Southern Ocean and motivate in-depth analysis of the wider climate-system impacts.

 Cloud base height (CBH) is one of the most uncertain parameters in surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) estimation. Climatology statistical models of cloud vertical structure (CVS), which provide 1-degree grid averages or latitude zone averages of CBH and cloud thickness (CT), have been frequently applied to improve coarse-resolution SDLR estimation. This study aims to develop a regional CVS climatology statistical model containing CT and CBH statistics at a kilometer scale, using CloudSat, CALIPSO, and MODIS data, and to explore its potential in kilometer-scale CBH and SDLR estimations. The RMSE of CBH estimated from the new CVS model ranges from 0.4 to 2.6 km for different cloud types when validated using CloudSat/CALIPSO data. CBH RMSEs are 2.20 km for Terra data and 1.99 km for Aqua data when validated against ground measurements. The simple Minnis CT model greatly overestimated CBH, while the new CVS model produced much better results. Using CBH from the new CVS model, the RMSEs of estimated cloudy SDLR are 26.8 W/m2 and 29.2 W/m2 for the Gupta-SDLR and Diak-SDLR models, respectively. These results are significantly better than those from the Minnis CT model and are comparable to those from the more advanced Yang-Cheng CT model. Moreover, the RMSEs of all-sky SDLR range from 22.6 to 21.5 W/m2 with resolution from 1 km to 20 km. These findings indicate that the regional CVS model is feasible for high-resolution CBH and SDLR estimation and can be effectively combined with other CBH estimation methods. This study provides a novel approach for estimating SDLR by integrating active and passive satellite data."

TCNN's performance remains superior through day 3, surpassing CMAQ's day 1 results. TCNN's improvement over standard CNN widens for longer forecasts, showing a 7.53% increase in R and a 12.27% reduction in RMSE by day 3. The model demonstrates robust spatial generalization in cross-validation on untrained stations.

 A deep atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) with a height of up to 4000–6000 m can develop over the Taklimakan Desert (TD). Nevertheless, the deep ABL in the TD was only studied for clean days.

Dust aerosols exerted a warming effect in the atmosphere reaching a maximum of about 1.0 K/day at the top of the dust aerosol layer and causing a temperature inversion. A CIL about 1000 m occurred between the CBL and the RL, which acted as a barrier, restraining CBL development and hindering dust aerosol transport. Furthermore, a deeper stable boundary layer on heavy dust days at night was observed. A unique vertical structure of nocturnal dust aerosol concentrations peaks of 477 μg/m3 was also observed in the deep RL at 1800–2600 m. The radiation effects of dust aerosols strengthened and weakened the stability of the RL above and below the dust layer, respectively. The study provided vertical observational evidence of the impact of dust aerosols on the deep ABL structure, thus contributing to a more profound comprehension of aerosol–radiation interactions over the desert arid region."

 The Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) represents a non-stationary time series characterized by distribution drift, posing a significant challenge to timely, effective, and accurate prediction. The Koopman operator theory provides a powerful mathematical tool for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems. It transforms nonlinear dynamic systems into linear dynamic systems, utilizing the linear Koopman operator to describe the evolution of system states. In this study, we propose an adaptation Koopman (Ada-Koopman) model based on the Koopman operator for predicting PM2.5 time series. The Ada-Koopman employs structural reparameterization and dynamic learning methods to effectively address the distribution drift problem arising from the non-stationarity of data. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline models, our model exhibits higher prediction accuracy in HPR, MPR and LPR of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. For the 24th hour, the Ada-Koopman model showed the most improvement in the accuracy of prediction in the high pollution regions with 39.82%, 17.44%, 15.95%, 5.80% and 14.21% improvement in RMSE compared to ARIMA, LSTM, DeepKoopman, KoopmanAE and KNF respectively. With segmented prediction and augmentation operators, Ada-Koopman alleviates the problem of error accumulation. It performs well in predicting high pollution peaks and low pollution valley values, particularly in the first hour."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120993,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文分析了2004年至2023年亚热带沿海地区非甲烷碳氢化合物（NMHCs）的长期变化趋势，并探讨了潜在的排放源变化和大气氧化能力。研究发现，乙烷浓度上升与石油和天然气开采有关，而乙炔和苯浓度下降则归因于汽油技术的改进。丙烷、异戊烷、正丁烷、正戊烷等NMHCs的变化趋势复杂，可能反映了不同排放源的综合影响。夏季，异戊二烯浓度显著增加，这与温度升高导致的排放增加有关。该研究通过Propy-Equiv浓度指标评估了大气氧化能力，并揭示了不同NMHCs排放趋势的时空变化特征，这对于理解大气污染和气候变化具有重要意义。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'non-methane hydrocarbons', 'NMHCs', 'isoprene', 'ethane', 'acetylene', 'benzene', 'Propy-Equiv', 'trend analysis', 'emission sources', 'biomass burning', 'gasoline technology', 'oil and gas extraction']",Morshad Ahmed;Mateen Ahmad;Bernhard Rappenglueck,Twenty years (2004–2023) observation of non-methane hydrocarbons in a subtropical coastal environment – Indications of increased isoprene emissions,"•Increasing ethane (1.05 ± 0.51 % year−1) is linked to oil and gas extraction. •Acetylene and benzene decreased due to improved gasoline technology. •Rising temperature led to higher isoprene emissions and Propy-Equiv concentrations. 
 A twenty-year (2004–2023) trend analysis of marine background air was conducted to explore potential changes in non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) emissions and atmospheric oxidation capacity using the Propylene Equivalent (Propy-Equiv) concentration. The focus was on C2-C6 NMHCs including alkanes, aromatics, acetylene, and isoprene, as those were most frequently found in the air samples. During wintertime, least impacted by photochemical impacts, a clear increase in n-pentane was observed from 2004 to 2023 (2.07 ± 2.26 % year−1) (statistically significant). Ethane (−3.82 ± 8.65 % year−1) and n-butane (−1.35 ± 15.62 % year−1) decreased from 2004 to 2008, but this was not statistically significant, but a statistically significant increase was then observed until 2023 (ethane: 1.05 ± 0.51 % year−1; n-butane: 1.09 ± 1.26 % year−1). Iso-pentane decreased (−4.25 ± 1.91 % year−1) steadily from 2004 to 2011 (statistically significant), then remained constant but with increased variability until 2023 (0.28 ± 2.49 % year−1). Propane increased (5.51 ± 23 1.35 % year−1) from 2004 to 2014 (statistically significant) and decreased thereafter until 2023 (−3.63 ± 3.91 % year−1). Acetylene (−1.67 ± 0.51 % year−1), benzene (−2.43 ± 0.14 % year−1), and i-butane (−0.58 ± 25 0.25 % year−1) showed a steady decreasing (statistically significant) trend from 2004 to 2023. The increasing ethane trend for the last 15 years is due to global oil and natural gas extraction, especially in the US, which began in mid-2009. Improvements in gasoline technologies are causing the decline of acetylene and benzene trends. The slower than expected decreasing trend of acetylene mixing ratio might have been offset by the impact of biomass burning emissions. Other NMHCs show varying trends indicating the merge of different emission sources and strengths in separate time periods. During the summertime, 80–90% Propy-Equiv concentration is due to isoprene, with a statistically significant increasing trend (0.45 ppbC/year) between 2004 and 2023. This increase is largely due to rising temperatures (1.58 ± 0.14 °C) leading to increased isoprene emissions (20 ± 1.6%)."

Garland;Hannah M. Horowitz,Quantifying the impacts of marine aerosols over the southeast Atlantic Ocean using a chemical transport model: implications for aerosol–cloud interactions,"Our research examines aerosol dynamics over the southeast Atlantic, a region with significant uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcings. Using the GEOS-Chem model, we find that at cloud altitudes, organic aerosols dominate during the biomass burning season, while sulfate aerosols, driven by marine emissions, prevail during peak primary production. These findings highlight the need for accurate representation of marine aerosols in models to improve climate predictions and reduce uncertainties. 
 The southeast Atlantic region, characterized by persistent stratocumulus clouds, has one of the highest uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing and significant variability across climate models. In this study, we analyze the seasonally varying role of marine aerosol sources and identify key uncertainties in aerosol composition at cloud-relevant altitudes over the southeast Atlantic using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. We evaluate simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) and speciated aerosol concentrations against those collected from ground observations and aircraft campaigns such as LASIC, ORACLES, and CLARIFY, conducted during 2017. The model consistently underestimates AOD relative to AERONET, particularly at remote locations like Ascension Island. However, when compared with aerosol mass concentrations from aircraft campaigns during the biomass burning period, it performs adequately at cloud-relevant altitudes, with a normalized mean bias (NMB) between −3.5 % (CLARIFY) and −7.5 % (ORACLES). At these altitudes, in the model, organic aerosols (63 %) dominate during the biomass burning period, while sulfate (41 %) prevails during austral summer, when dimethylsulfide (DMS) emissions peak in the model. Our findings indicate that marine sulfate can account for up to 69 % of total sulfate during the high-DMS period. Sensitivity analyses indicate that refining DMS emissions and oxidation chemistry may increase sulfate aerosol produced from marine sources, highlighting that there remains large uncertainty as to the role of DMS emissions in the marine boundary layer. Additionally, we find marine primary organic aerosol emissions may substantially increase total organic aerosol concentrations, particularly during austral summer. This study underscores the imperative need to refine marine emissions and their chemical transformations, as aerosols from marine sources are a major component of total aerosols at cloud-relevant altitudes and may impact uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing over the southeast Atlantic."

The oxidation mechanism of acetone was investigated using an observation-based model incorporating a Master Chemical Mechanism model. A higher SOA yield of acetone was observed compared to methylglyoxal due to an enhanced uptake of the small photooxidation products of acetone. 
 Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) from highly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are currently not well represented in numerical models as their heterogeneous formation mechanisms in the atmosphere remain unclear. Based on the smog chamber experiments, here we investigated the yield and formation pathway of SOA from acetone photochemical reactions under low-NOx conditions in the presence of preexisting haze particles ((NH4)2SO4 and NH4HSO4) and saline mineral particles (Na2SO4) under ammonia-rich conditions. Our results showed that the yield of acetone-derived SOA is remarkably enhanced via multiphase reactions in the presence of these preexisting seeds, especially for the saline mineral particles. We found that aerosol acidity is a key factor controlling the formation pathways of acetone-derived SOA, in which organic acids, alcohol, and carbonyls produced from acetone photochemical reactions dissolve into the aqueous phase of the preexisting seeds and subsequently esterify and/or oligomerize into SOAs that consist of larger molecules on the acidic aerosols but smaller molecules on the neutral mineral aerosols. Moreover, the light absorption ability of the acetone-derived SOA formed on (NH4)2SO4 aerosols is stronger than that formed on Na2SO4 mineral particles, especially in the presence of ammonia, due to a formation of N-containing organics. Through comparison with that from methylglyoxal (MGly), we found that the total SOA from acetone in the chamber is 2.8–8.2 times that from the irreversible uptake of MGly, suggesting that only considering MGly as the precursor of acetone-derived SOA will probably underestimate the role of acetone in global SOA production since acetone abundantly exists in the troposphere."

Trained on ice crystal images from the Arctic taken by a holographic camera, it correctly classifies over 92 % of the ice crystals. These more detailed insights into the components of aggregated ice crystals have the potential to improve our estimates of microphysical properties such as riming rate, aggregation rate, and ice water content. 
 The shape of ice crystals affects their radiative properties, growth rate, fall speed, and collision efficiency; thus, it plays a significant role in cloud optical properties and precipitation formation. Ambient conditions, like temperature and humidity, determine the basic habit of ice crystals, while microphysical processes, such as riming and aggregation, further shape them, resulting in a diverse set of ice crystal shapes and effective densities. Current classification algorithms face two major challenges: (1) ice crystals are often classified as a whole (at the image scale), necessitating identification of the dominant component of aggregated ice crystals, and (2) single-label classifications lead to information loss because of the compromise between basic habit and microphysical process information. To address these limitations, we present a two-pronged solution here: (1) a rotated object detection algorithm (IceDetectNet) that classifies each component of an aggregated ice crystal individually and (2) a multi-label classification scheme that considers both basic habits and physical processes simultaneously. IceDetectNet was trained and tested on two independent datasets obtained by a holographic imager during the NASCENT campaign in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, in November 2019 and April 2020. The algorithm correctly classified 92 % of the ice crystals as either aggregate or non-aggregate and achieved an overall accuracy of 86 % for basic habits and 82 % for microphysical process classification. At the component scale, IceDetectNet demonstrated high detection and classification accuracy across all sizes, indicating its ability to effectively classify individual components of aggregated ice crystals. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrated a good generalization ability by classifying ice crystals from an independent generalization dataset with overall accuracies above 70 %. IceDetectNet can provide a deeper understanding of ice crystal shapes, leading to better estimates of ice crystal mass, fall velocity, and radiative properties; therefore, it has the potential to improve precipitation forecasts and climate projections."

The instrument uses small Arduino microcontrollers and inexpensive laser diodes to reduce cost while maintaining high performance comparable to more expensive instruments. Performance was assessed with intercomparisons between commercially available instruments outdoors. The design's simplicity, performance, and price point allow it to be accessible to a variety of users. 
 Water vapor in the atmospheric boundary layer poses a significant measurement challenge, with abundances varying by an order of magnitude over short spatial and temporal scales. Herein, we describe the design and characterization of an economical and flexible open-path, fast-response instrument for measurements of water vapor. The in situ method of tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy in the shortwave infrared was chosen based on a heritage with previous instruments developed in our laboratory and flown on research aircraft. The instrument is constructed from readily available components and based on low-cost distributed feedback laser diodes that enjoy widespread use for high-speed fiber-optic telecommunications. A pair of versatile, high-speed Advanced RISC Machine-based microcontrollers drive the laser and acquire and store data. High precision and reproducibility are obtained by tight temperature regulation of the laser with a miniature commercial proportional-integral controller. The instrument is powered by two rechargeable 3.6 V lithium-ion batteries, consumes 2 W of power, weighs under 1 kg, and is constructed from hardware costing less than USD 3000. The new tunable diode laser spectrometer (TDLS) agreed to within 2 % compared to a laboratory standard and displayed a precision of 10 ppm at a sample rate of 10 Hz. The new instrument is robust and simple to use, allowing users with little previous experience in laser spectroscopy to acquire high-quality, fast-response observations of water vapor for a variety of applications. These include frequent horizontal and vertical profiling by uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs); long-term eddy covariance measurements from fixed and portable flux towers; and routine measurements of humidity from weather stations in remote locations such as the polar ice caps, mountains, and glaciers."

The correction can then be extended backwards and forwards in time for periods when better-quality maps are not available. The method is fast and gives good results. It is then applied to obtain a climatology of the snow cover in Switzerland over the past 60 years at a resolution of 1 d and 1 km. This is the first time that such a dataset has been produced. 
 Snow plays a crucial role in regional climate systems worldwide. It is a key variable in the context of climate change because of its direct feedback to the climate system, while at the same time being very sensitive to climate change. Long-term spatial data on snow cover and snow water equivalent are scarce, due to the lack of satellite data or forcing data to run land surface models back in time. This study presents an R package, SnowQM, designed to correct for the bias in long-term spatial snow water equivalent data compared to a shorter-term and more accurate dataset, using the more accurate data to calibrate the correction. The bias-correction is based on the widely applied quantile mapping approach. A new method of spatial and temporal grouping of the data points is used to calculate the quantile distributions for each pixel. The main functions of the package are written in C++ to achieve high performance. Parallel computing is implemented in the C++ part of the code. In a case study over Switzerland, where a 60-year snow water equivalent climatology is produced at a resolution of 1 d and 1 km, SnowQM reduces the bias in snow water equivalent from −9 to −2 mm in winter and from −41 to −2 mm in spring. We show that the C++ implementation notably outperforms simple R implementation. The limitations of the quantile mapping approach for snow, such as snow creation, are discussed. The proposed spatial data grouping improves the correction in homogeneous terrain, which opens the way for further use with other variables."

 Retrieving wind profiles from Doppler lidar radial velocities requires processing software tools. The heterogeneity of Doppler lidar types and data acquisition settings, as well as scan patterns applied for wind profiling, make wind profile processing challenging. Addressing this challenge, a new modular open-source wind profile retrieval software is presented: the Atmospheric Profile Processing toolKIT (AtmoProKIT). The software calculates quality controlled wind profiles from heterogeneous Doppler lidar data, i.e. independent of the system type, data acquisition settings or the scan pattern applied. Ingestion of heterogeneous data is enabled by the definition of a standardized level 1 data format for the measurements, from which level 2 wind profiles are retrieved. Processing flexibility is enabled through the combination of modular processing steps in module chains. Modifications are possible by individually arranging modules, adding calculation modules or adjusting processing parameters. The documentation of the processing steps in the result’s metadata ensures the traceability of the results. A standard module chain is presented, which allows for straightforward wind profile retrieval for common Doppler lidar measurement scenarios without the need for coding. The results provided by the standard module chain are validated against radiosondes for three common Doppler lidar systems in differing atmospheric conditions.

In this work, Cu-CHA and Cu-LTA catalysts containing only Cu2+-2Z species were successfully synthesized by a novel impregnation (NIM) method, exhibiting remarkably enhanced hydrothermal stability and sulfur resistance compared with any reported Cu-exchanged zeolite catalysts. It was also found that the [Cu(OH)]+-Z sites can convert to Cu2+-2Z by treating at high temperature (850 °C) due to the self-reduction of Cu2+ to highly mobile Cu+.

Tong;Marshall Burke,Evaluating Chemical Transport and Machine Learning Models for Wildfire Smoke PM2.5: Implications for Assessment of Health Impacts,"Growing wildfire smoke represents a substantial threat to air quality and human health. However, the impact of wildfire smoke on human health remains imprecisely understood due to uncertainties in both the measurement of exposure of population to wildfire smoke and dose–response functions linking exposure to health. Here, we compare daily wildfire smoke-related surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations estimated using three approaches, including two chemical transport models (CTMs): GEOS-Chem and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and one machine learning (ML) model over the contiguous US in 2020, a historically active fire year. In the western US, compared against surface PM2.5 measurements from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and PurpleAir sensors, we find that CTMs overestimate PM2.5 concentrations during extreme smoke episodes by up to 3–5 fold, while ML estimates are largely consistent with surface measurements. However, in the eastern US, where smoke levels were much lower in 2020, CTMs show modestly better agreement with surface measurements. We develop a calibration framework that integrates CTM- and ML-based approaches to yield estimates of smoke PM2.5 concentrations that outperform individual approach. When combining the estimated smoke PM2.5 concentrations with county-level mortality rates, we find consistent effects of low-level smoke on mortality but large discrepancies in effects of high-level smoke exposure across different methods. Our research highlights the differences across estimation methods for understanding the health impacts of wildfire smoke and demonstrates the importance of bench-marking estimates with available surface measurements."
10.1029/2024GL112389,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了北极对流层上部和平流层下部 (UTLS) 近期出现的冬季降温现象。尽管北极地表温度持续升高，但UTLS区域却出现了降温趋势，这与2000年之前布鲁弗-多布森环流的增强和水汽含量的减少，以及2000年之后环流减弱和水汽含量增加有关。研究利用多个再分析数据集和卫星观测数据，分析了布鲁弗-多布森环流变化、水汽含量变化以及辐射冷却等因素对北极UTLS温度变化的影响。  研究结果揭示了北极UTLS温度变化的复杂机制，对理解极地-中纬度相互作用具有重要意义。 这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析，例如对平流层水汽含量的观测和分析。,"['stratospheric water vapor', 'temperature', 'Brewer-Dobson circulation', 'Arctic UTLS', 'satellite observations', 'reanalysis data']",Jintao Zhu;Wuke Wang;Jin Hong;Luzhen Wu;Ming Shangguan;Shuyun Zhao;Qimin Deng,Recent Wintertime Cooling in the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere of the Arctic,"As Arctic surface temperatures exhibit amplified warming, a warming center in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) is also notable, which potentially plays a crucial role in polar‐to‐mid‐latitude interactions. While the surface warming has accelerated recently, UTLS temperatures, however, have declined since 2001, as demonstrated by multiple reanalysis data sets. This shift in trends provides a unique opportunity to understand the factors influencing Arctic UTLS temperature changes. Further analysis indicates that the descending component of the Brewer‐Dobson (BD) circulation over the Arctic was strengthened before 2000 but weakened thereafter. Simultaneously, Arctic lower stratospheric water vapor showed a decreasing trend before 2000, followed by an increasing trend. The weakening of the BD circulation led to reduced dynamical heating, and the increased water vapor resulted in enhanced radiative cooling, which together contributed to the cooling of the Arctic UTLS after 2000."

Current O3 uptake predictions are limited by the simplistic big‐leaf schemes commonly used in chemical transport models (CTMs) to parameterize deposition. Such schemes fail to reproduce observed O3 fluxes over terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the need for more realistic treatment of surface‐atmosphere exchange in CTMs. We address this need by linking a resolved canopy model (1D Multi‐Layer Canopy CHemistry and Exchange Model, MLC‐CHEM) to the GEOS‐Chem CTM and use this new framework to simulate O3 fluxes over three north temperate forests. We compare results with in situ measurements from four field studies and with standalone, observationally constrained MLC‐CHEM runs to test current knowledge of O3 deposition and its drivers. We show that GEOS‐Chem overpredicts observed O3 fluxes across all four studies by up to 2×, whereas the resolved‐canopy models capture observed diel profiles of O3 deposition and in‐canopy concentrations to within 10%. Relative humidity and solar irradiance are strong O3 flux drivers over these forests, and uncertainties in those fields provide the largest remaining source of model deposition biases. Flux partitioning analysis shows that: (a) nonstomatal loss accounts for 60% of O3 deposition on average; (b) in‐canopy chemistry makes only a small contribution to total O3 fluxes; and (c) the CTM big‐leaf treatment overestimates O3‐driven stomatal loss and plant phytotoxicity in these temperate forests by up to 7×. Results motivate the application of fully online vertically explicit canopy schemes in CTMs for improved O3 predictions."

Gas‐particle partitioning on dust not only modifies species' chemical evolutions but also influences their deposition velocity. However, how does dust heterogeneous chemistry impacts acid deposition remains unexplored. In this research, we integrated dust photocatalytic mechanism into GEOS‐Chem to assess its impact on sulfur removal across various regions and time spans in China. We find the photocatalytic mechanism enhances simulation performances of acid deposition. Observational validation demonstrates significant reductions in modeling bias for sulfur dioxide (SO2) dry deposition and sulfate (SO4) total deposition. Additionally, the improved model captures the declining trend of SO4 deposition over 2006–2020. We further identified two key impacts of photocatalytic chemistry: firstly, our findings indicate it enhances sulfur removal more efficiently in near‐desert areas like North China Plain (NCP) than in downwind areas like Yunnan‐Guizhou‐Chongqing region (YGY). Lifetimes of total sulfur reduced from 3.29 to 2.46 days in NCP, and from 2.46 to 1.95 days in YGY. This discrepancy results from faster conversion of SO2 to dust‐phase SO4 and larger proportions of coarse‐mode particles in NCP, resulting in accelerated SO4 deposition velocity. Secondly, our results indicate that because dust photocatalytic chemistry amplifies removal of sulfur through SO4 formation and deposition, decreased dust emission resulted in enhanced sulfur lifetimes over 2006–2014. Sensitivity experiments further show higher dust concentrations accelerate pollutants' removal. These findings underscore the importance of dust heterogeneous chemistry in influencing sulfur deposition, providing scientific insights for mitigating acid deposition in China."

We introduce a novel machine learning methodology to predict PM2.5 levels at 30 m long segments along the roads and at a temporal scale of 10 seconds. A hybrid dataset was curated from an intensive PM campaign in Selly Oak, Birmingham, UK, utilizing citizen scientists and low-cost instruments strategically placed in static and mobile settings. Spatially resolved proxy variables, meteorological parameters, and PM properties were integrated, enabling a fine-grained analysis of PM2.5.

 Comprehending the resilience of regional hydroclimate in response to CO2 removal is essential for guiding future mitigation and adaptation strategies. Using an ensemble of model simulations forced by idealized CO2 ramp-up followed by ramp-down, here we show that the winter precipitation over the Northeastern Pacific and Western North America (NPWNA) is irreversible even if global warming is reversed back to 2 °C level. This asymmetric change features a tripolar pattern and is tied to Aleutian Low intensification, which is driven by both zonal and meridional gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical central-eastern Pacific. Distinct from the zonal SST gradient—explained by different timescales of surface and subsurface warming and ocean dynamical processes, amplified through the Bjerknes feedback—the meridional SST gradient originates from the southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone, maintained by the wind-evaporation-SST feedback. Our findings suggest that the regional hydrological risks over the NPWNA induced by CO2 ramp-up cannot be fully eliminated by CO2 removal even if the global warming level is restored back."

 Effective abatement of air-pollution-induced health damages requires a comprehensive understanding of the changing roles of individual sources and cross-regional transport.

We find that the marginal national premature deaths, dominated by PM2.5 exposure, have declined from 151,842 per 10% growth of emissions in 2013 to 111,271 in 2020, and would further to 54,293 in 2035 following a carbon peaking and carbon neutrality pathway. The impacts of certain species-category combinations have grown including NOX from industrial combustion and off-road traffic. The proportions of cross-provincial to marginal health burden have remained stable at around 50%.

 This study investigates the critical role of meteorological variability, particularly polar vortex dynamics, in shaping PM2.5 anomaly patterns across sub-regions in East Asia. Following sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in winter, East Asia experienced significant tropospheric transitions, including cooling-to-warming shifts. The strengthening of the Mongolian high, combined with tropospheric warming, altered lower tropospheric dynamics. Contrasting warming in Mongolia and cooling to the north intensified baroclinic instability, creating anomalous Mongolian cyclones for increased dust storm activity and higher PM2.5 levels. Elevated PM2.5 concentrations in eastern China, driven by substantial anthropogenic emissions, were dispersed by the divergent flow under the Mongolian high. Cyclones with increased baroclinic instability over southern and northeastern China contributed to precipitation, which led to negative anomaly variations of PM2.5 aerosols. Downwind regions like Korea saw elevated PM2.5 anomalies due to stable lower tropospheric conditions driven by the movement of the warmed Mongolian high."

 This study investigates the response of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) precipitation to CO2 removal, with a specific focus on regional and subseasonal variations. Following CO2 removal, monsoon circulation weakens throughout the summer owing to the reduced large-scale meridional temperature gradient around India. Weakened monsoon circulation decreases the local-scale thermodynamic stability within India, following monsoon-onset periods. While the frequency of synoptic-scale ISM low-pressure systems (LPSs) decreases overall, the lower thermodynamic stability causes the LPSs to form and resultantly shift west and south from their typical paths, last longer and move more quickly zonally during August and September. Changes in these rain-producing processes induce distinct regional (Western Ghats, south-central-east India, and Tamil Nadu) and subseasonal precipitation responses. Also, extreme precipitation exhibits similar patterns, but is more strongly affected by changes in LPS. Our results suggest that reliable future projections of regional hydroclimate change require a more accurate understanding of multi-scale precipitation processes."

 Change of zonal thermal contrast in the upper troposphere (ZTUT) between Asia and the North Pacific is a highly concerned issue, as it profoundly influences the Northern hemispheric climate. However, the physical reasons, particularly the anthropogenic influences on the ZTUT change are not well understood. Here, we show that increased aerosols and greenhouse gases tend to weaken the summer Asian-Pacific ZTUT, through affecting radiation processes over the Tibetan Plateau and altering moist enthalpy advections over the North Pacific, respectively. Under the present climate, aerosol variations play a leading role in the trend change of summer ZTUT from a deceasing to an increasing pattern in the mid-1980s. These decreasing and increasing trends are, respectively, enhanced and attenuated by greenhouse gas emissions. Toward the end of this century under the SSP2–4.5 scenario, continuous increases in greenhouse gases are expected to become the dominant contributor for projected weakening of summer ZTUT, with the rate offset by decreases in aerosols."

 El Niño-Southern Oscillation-induced tropical Pacific precipitation anomalies have global impacts and will intensify under greenhouse warming, but the potential for mitigating these changes is less understood. Here, we identify distinct hysteresis features in the precipitation-sea surface temperature sensitivity between strong El Niño and La Niña phases using a large ensemble carbon removal numerical simulation. The strong El Niño precipitation sensitivity exhibits a century-scale hysteretic enhancement and eastward shift, mainly due to modulated deep convection anomalies by the Intertropical Convergence Zone via cloud-longwave feedback. Instead, the strong La Niña counterpart is concentrated toward the equator, mostly in the central-western Pacific, with a shorter hysteresis period of a few decades. This primarily involves changes in shallow convection and surface thermal structures during La Niña, shaped by global warming-induced upper-ocean circulation changes. The distinct climate change regimes of strong El Niño and La Niña precipitation sensitivity hold important implications for assessing mitigation consequences. The hysteresis in precipitation-sea surface temperature sensitivity differs between strong El Niño and La Niña phases, with El Niño intensifying and shifting eastward due to deep convection, while La Niña is more equator-centered with a shorter hysteresis period, according to a large ensemble simulation of symmetric CO2 ramp-up and ramp-down pathways."

 Global warming has impacted water cycle, but not exist a global study of the changes at global scale of the impacts on water available for plants. Here, cloud-optimized monthly aggregated climate reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts dataset indicates that from 1960 to 2023, 27.9% of the global land surface became significantly more arid, while 20.5% became significantly less arid. This indicates a shift towards drier climates, with humid, semi-humid, and semi-arid areas decreasing by 8.51, 1.45, and 0.53 million-km², respectively, and arid and hyper-arid areas increasing by 6.34 and 4.18 million-km², respectively. This total increase of 9.99 million km² in arid areas represents 5.9% of the global land surface, excluding Greenland and Antarctica. Accelerated aridification has occurred in already dry regions, such as South-west North-America, North-Brazil, the European-Basin, North-Africa, the Middle-East, the Sahel, and central-Asia, with central-Africa as a new hotspot. The main driver is the disproportionate increase in potential evapotranspiration relative to rainfall, attributed to rising atmospheric temperatures, which also reduces the land’s carbon sink capacity, potentially exacerbating climate warming.

 Ocean images collected by astronauts onboard the Apollo spacecraft more than 50 years ago revealed a large number of ocean eddies, with a size between 1 and 20 km. Since then, satellite infrared, ocean color, sun glitter and synthetic aperture radar images, with high spatial resolution, have confirmed the ubiquitous presence of these small eddies in all oceans. However, observing the dynamical characteristics and evolution of these eddies has remained challenging. An experiment was recently carried out in the California Current system using the new airborne Doppler Scatterometer (National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Jet Propulsion Laboratory DopplerScatt) instrument that observes surface velocities. Here, with DopplerScatt, we mapped a 30 × 100 km domain over multiple days to unveil numerous 1–20 km ocean eddies, called submesoscale eddies, that evolve over a period of a few hours. The strong interactions between eddies generate horizontal velocity divergence, implying vertical velocities reaching 250 m day−1 at 40 m depth. The velocity field also produces horizontal dispersion of particles over a distance of 50 km within 12 h, which rapidly fills the turbulent eddy field. These observations suggest that submesoscale ocean turbulence may profoundly affect the vertical transport of heat, carbon, and important climatic gases between the atmosphere and the ocean interior, as well as the horizontal dispersion of tracers and particles. As such, submesoscale ocean eddies are a critical element of Earth’s climate system. Submesoscale eddies in the upper ocean play a critical role in the vertical transport and dispersion of ocean properties, including heat, nutrients, and carbon, making them essential for regulating the Earth’s climate system, according to results from the new airborne Doppler Scatterometer."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad961d,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文关注的是中国和印度在未来气候变化情景下，高温、PM2.5和O3极端事件同时发生的加剧趋势。即使在严格的空气污染控制措施下，模型预测显示，这些极端事件的共同发生频率仍然会显著增加。研究使用了区域气候-化学耦合模型，对2096-2100年与2010-2014年相比进行了预测。其结果与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为对PM2.5和O3等大气成分的准确监测，以及对气温和污染物时空分布的卫星观测数据，都是构建和验证此类气候-化学模型的关键。此外，研究的最终目标是评估这些极端事件对健康的影响，这与大气环境遥感技术的应用直接相关。,"['PM2.5', 'O3', 'heat waves', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'climate modeling', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'health impact assessment']",Meng Gao;Fan Wang;Yangyang Xu;Ji Chen;Xiao Lu;Gregory R Carmichael,"Future intensification of co-occurrences of heat, PM2.5 and O3 extremes in China and India despite stringent air pollution controls","Heat and air pollution extremes are two leading global health stressors, both of which are particularly serious in China and India. It is well recognized that exposure to co-occurrence of heat and air pollution extremes will cause amplified health outcomes, yet century‐long understanding of future co‐occurrence is still lacking. On the basis of sophisticated regional coupled climate-chemistry modeling, we predict future individual and joint occurrences of heat and air pollution extremes in China and India in 2096–2100 relative to 2010–2014. We find intensified co-occurrences of heat and air pollution extremes in both China and India, despite reductions in projected emissions and improved air quality. Under the medium air pollution control of SSP245, the frequency of Tw&amp;PM&amp;O3 joint hazard increases by 382% in North India, and 729% in Beijing by the end of this century. Given the significant role of temperature changes in the co-occurrence and larger compounding health impacts, actions are urgently needed to reduce exposure to co-extreme events."

To inform management decisions and to ensure that water can be allocated efficiently and equitably, decisionmakers and stakeholders will require new methods of agricultural water use accounting (WUA) that are consistent, transparent, and fast. Here we provide estimates of agricultural water use across the entire Colorado River Basin using publicly available data from OpenET, and we demonstrate strong agreement with available WUA from the US Bureau of Reclamation. Crucially, the methods employed here allow basin-wide agricultural water accounting to be completed in a matter of hours—a process that currently takes months or even years. We demonstrate how these same data can also be used to inform water conservation strategies at the field scale, thereby synchronizing basin-scale water accounting with project-scale conservation planning. We discuss key sources of uncertainty inherent in the methodology, along with strategies for managing those uncertainties to improve agricultural water conservation planning."

The traditional metric—temperature variance—is insufficient to reflect the temporal evolution of this WWE. Therefore, we introduce a novel metric termed ‘flash-cold’ to identify the sharp and significant decrease in surface air temperature. This new metric not only effectively captures recent WWEs trend in line with variance-based metric but also allows daily tracking of temperature shifts. Using the flash-cold metric, we delineate the evolution of the WWE case in China into four phases: first warm spell, first flash-cold, second warm spell, and second flash-cold (corresponding to the unprecedented cold wave). A recently proposed Lagrangian temperature budget analysis highlights the crucial role of high-latitude blocking circulation in both flash-cold phases through cold advection. The first flash-cold phase was triggered by backward cold air masses driven by upstream systems associated with Okhotsk blocking, while the second flash-cold phase developed when the trough downstream of Ural blocking moved eastward and rotated counterclockwise. In contrast, subtropical systems moderated the decreasing temperature during the first flash-cold through diabatic processes but had minimal impact on the second flash-cold, helping to explain why the second flash-cold was more intense. From a multiscale interaction perspective, the development of these blocking circulations was facilitated by a background of exceptionally weak meridional gradient of potential vorticity, the smallest recorded since 1979."

Temporal inconsistencies are often mitigated by using TC data from more homogeneous periods. For example, TC records since 1980 are preferred for frequency and track analysis, while records for intensity analysis have become more consistent since ∼2000. However, such measures reduce the sample size for trend analysis, potentially leading to conflicting conclusions due to natural climate-variability. Inter-agency best track data can also vary, due to differences in the way best track information—such as centre fix locations and associated intensity estimates—are defined and assessed. When comparing global datasets and regional datasets, additional inconsistencies can be introduced where TCs form or track just outside the official area of responsibility for each agency. We highlight discrepancies in Australian TC best track data from various sources by comparing it to a more rigorously scrutinized dataset compiled by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. This dataset is found to have highly accurate TC records for the Australian region. We also highlight the implications of data differences on TC-related trend analysis, aiming to increase awareness of dataset inconsistencies while guiding credible climate-change detection and attribution messages."

Ice crystals smaller than 50 µm were found in this optically thin cirrus cloud layer. Combined analysis of back trajectories, satellite, and model data revealed that the formation of this layer was influenced by waves and stratospheric hydration induced by typhoon Hato. 
 We investigate the formation mechanism of a tropopause cirrus cloud layer observed during the Balloon measurement campaigns of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (BATAL) over Hyderabad (17.47° N, 78.58° E), India, on 23 August 2017. Simultaneous measurements from a backscatter sonde and an optical particle counter on board a balloon flight revealed the presence of a subvisible cirrus cloud layer (optical thickness ∼ 0.025) at the cold-point tropopause (temperature ∼ −86.4 °C, altitude ∼ 17.9 km). Ice crystals in this layer are smaller than 50 µm with a layer mean ice crystal number concentration of about 46.79 L−1. Simultaneous backscatter and extinction coefficient measurements allowed us to estimate the range-resolved extinction to backscatter coefficient ratio (lidar ratio) inside this layer with a layer mean value of about 32.18 ± 6.73 sr, which is in good agreement with earlier reported values at similar cirrus cloud temperatures. The formation mechanism responsible for this tropopause cirrus is investigated using a combination of three-dimensional back trajectories, satellite observations, and ERA5 reanalysis data. Satellite observations revealed that the overshooting convection associated with a category 3 typhoon, Hato, which hit Macau and Hong Kong on 23 August 2017, injected ice into the lower stratosphere. This caused a hydration patch that followed the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone to subsequently move towards Hyderabad. The presence of tropopause cirrus cloud layers in the cold temperature anomalies and updrafts along the back trajectories suggested the role of typhoon-induced waves in their formation. This case study highlights the role of typhoons in influencing the formation of tropopause cirrus clouds through stratospheric hydration and waves."

 Two groups of retrieval algorithms, physics based and machine learning (ML) based, each consisting of two independent approaches, have been developed to retrieve cloud base height (CBH) and its diurnal cycle from Himawari-8 geostationary satellite observations. Validations have been conducted using the joint CloudSat/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) CBH products in 2017, ensuring independent assessments. Results show that the two ML-based algorithms exhibit markedly superior performance (the optimal method is with a correlation coefficient of R > 0.91 and an absolute bias of approximately 0.8 km) compared to the two physics-based algorithms. However, validations based on CBH data from the ground-based lidar at the Lijiang station in Yunnan Province and the cloud radar at the Nanjiao station in Beijing, China, explicitly present contradictory outcomes (R < 0.60). An identifiable issue arises with significant underestimations in the retrieved CBH by both ML-based algorithms, leading to an inability to capture the diurnal cycle characteristics of CBH. The strong consistence observed between CBH derived from ML-based algorithms and the spaceborne active sensors of CloudSat/CALIOP may be attributed to utilizing the same dataset for training and validation, sourced from the CloudSat/CALIOP products. In contrast, the CBH derived from the optimal physics-based algorithm demonstrates good agreement in diurnal variations in CBH with ground-based lidar/cloud radar observations during the daytime (with an R value of approximately 0.7). Therefore, the findings in this investigation from ground-based observations advocate for the more reliable and adaptable nature of physics-based algorithms in retrieving CBH from geostationary satellite measurements. Nevertheless, under ideal conditions, with an ample dataset of spaceborne cloud profiling radar observations encompassing the entire day for training purposes, the ML-based algorithms may hold promise for still delivering accurate CBH outputs."

Direct measurement of ambient aerosol pH, however, remains challenging for atmospheric scientists. Here, based on the method of colorimetric analysis on aerosol-loaded pH-indicator papers, we develop a new device that can achieve in situ and real-time measurement of the pH of ambient aerosol droplets at a fixed relative humidity of 90%. The design of this device provides a more convenient and efficient method than the pH paper methods used in previous studies by allowing automated sample switching and data recording. The size range of ambient aerosols that are collected on pH papers is determined to be ∼0.4–2.5 μm. In addition, a standardized calibration procedure is established using pH buffer standards. An intensive ambient measurement was performed with the device to examine its operational stability as well as the reliability of the measured results. The measured aerosol pH reveals good agreement with those calculated by two commonly used thermodynamic models, i.e., ISORROPIA and E-AIM. These comparisons further demonstrate that the thermodynamic models are capable of predicting aerosol pH with a reasonable range of uncertainty."

Most of these deaths occur in the Global South, particularly in Africa. However, the means of observing this air pollution in these countries are lacking. Knowledge of pollutant concentration levels and their distribution in time and space is inadequate or nonexistent in most African countries. This study focuses on the temporal and spatial distribution of PM2.5 in Burkina Faso, a country of more than 22 million residents yet with very scarce air pollution literature. The study used Clarity low-cost sensors. The sensors were placed at 19 sites throughout the country, including 13 in Ouagadougou, the capital, and three in Bobo-Dioulasso and three in Koudougou, the second and third largest cities in Burkina Faso, respectively. The measurements were taken over a one year period (November 2021 to November 2022). The data was corrected using a Gaussian Mixture Regression trained on a 2-month colocation of a TEOM with a Clarity monitor in Ouagadougou. The corrected mean daily concentrations measured at all of the sites ranged from 17 to 68 μg/m3, with an overall daily average of 46.7 μg/m3. The city averages are 48.5 μg/m3 for Ouagadougou, 46.9 μg/m3 for Bobo-Dioulasso, and 38.7 μg/m3 for Koudougou. These concentrations are significantly higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended safe daily guideline, 15 μg/m3. Measurement values are highest during the dry season, which is dominated by the Harmattan winds from the Sahara desert. At all sites, between 61% and 87% of the measured days exceeded the WHO daily guidelines for PM2.5. These measurements show the need to undertake an action plan to reduce air pollution in general in Burkina Faso in order to better protect the population health."

Environmental benefits and risks may be interactively and inequitably distributed across different populations in cities, and these patterns may change over time. Here, we assess the spatial distribution of environmental risks and benefits in pairs, considering synergies and trade‐offs, in an illustrative metropolitan area (Metro Vancouver) in Canada in the years 2006 and 2016. We classify census dissemination areas as sweet, sour, risky, or medium spots based on relative exposures for six environmental combinations: Walkability and NO2; heat stress and NO2; vegetation coverage and NO2; vegetation coverage and heat stress; walkability and accessibility to natural recreational areas; and heat stress and accessibility to natural recreational areas. We evaluate whether different population groups are disproportionately exposed to lower environmental quality based on linear regressions and other metrics. We find that while performance for individual environmental variables improved over the decade, considering their combinations, sweet spots became sweeter and sour spots became sourer. Residents with high material and social deprivation and visible minorities were disproportionately exposed to lower environmental quality in both years for most of the environmental combinations. Further, we find that these inequities were not improving over time for all groups: for instance, South Asian residents in the region faced higher disproportionate burdens or diminished access to benefits in 2016, as compared to 2006. Given these findings, we suggest considerations of cumulative exposure in prioritizing areas for intervention, targeting the sour and risky spots persistently experienced by overburdened populations."

 Antarctic sea ice extent has seen a slight increase over recent decades, yet since 2016, it has undergone a sharp decline, reaching record lows. While the precise impact of anthropogenic forcing remains uncertain, natural fluctuations have been shown to be important for this variability. Our study employs a series of coupled model experiments, revealing that with constant anthropogenic forcing, the primary driver of interannual sea ice variability lies in deep convection within the Southern Ocean, although it is model dependent. However, as anthropogenic forcing increases, the influence of deep convection weakens, and the Southern Annular Mode, an atmospheric intrinsic variability, plays a more significant role in the sea ice fluctuations owing to the shift from a zonal wavenumber-three pattern observed in the historical period. These model results indicate that surface air-sea interaction will play a more prominent role in Antarctic sea ice variability in the future.

 Ammonia volatilized from penguin excreta is a significant nitrogen source in Antarctic ecosystems, influencing climate through new particle formation (NPF). Freeze-thaw events can trigger ammonia emissions, but their impact on penguin-derived ammonia is understudied and overlooked in models. Here we investigate the contribution of penguins to ammonia and their climatic impacts using cruise observations and GEOS-Chem-APM simulations. High ammonia concentrations, with a maximum exceeding 7000 ng/m3, were observed over the Southern Ocean and Prydz Bay, driven by air masses from penguin colonies. Simulations showed that incorporating freeze-thaw impact improves model performance, with penguin-derived ammonia emissions enhanced by up to 20-fold and reaching a total of 49 Gg across Antarctica in November. Elevated ammonia increased simulated secondary particle number concentrations by 30−300% through NPF, enhancing simulated cloud droplet number concentrations by 10−20% and altering cloud properties. This study underscores the importance of incorporating penguin emissions into models, particularly during freeze-thaw events."

 Analysis of a suite of global climate model projections under symmetric CO2 ramp-up and ramp-down (RD) scenarios, our results demonstrate a progressive strengthening of the western North Pacific anticyclone (WNPAC) with rising CO2 concentrations, a trend that persists as CO2 declines, followed by gradual recovery without fully returning to its initial state when CO2 concentrations restore. The overshoot of the WNPAC in the CO2 RD phase is highly correlated with the enhanced anomalous Maritime Continent (MC) convection, which influences WNPAC through reinforced Kelvin wave response or local Hadley circulation adjustment. This enhanced convection is attributed to increased Indo-Pacific zonal SST gradient associated with strengthened MC warming and accelerated decay of El Niño in the Central Pacific, ultimately linked to climatological equatorial Pacific El Niño-like warming pattern-related air-sea processes. The overshoot of the WNPAC during the CO2 RD phase may exacerbate flood and high temperature risks in densely populated East Asia."

 In 2023, wildfires burned 15 million hectares in Canada, more than doubling the previous record. These wildfires caused a record number of evacuations, unprecedented air quality impacts across Canada and the northeastern United States, and substantial strain on fire management resources. Using climate models, we show that human-induced climate change significantly increased the likelihood of area burned at least as large as in 2023 across most of Canada, with more than two-fold increases in the east and southwest. The long fire season was more than five times as likely and the large areas across Canada experiencing synchronous extreme fire weather were also much more likely due to human influence on the climate. Simulated emissions from the 2023 wildfire season were eight times their 1985-2022 mean. With continued warming, the likelihood of extreme fire seasons is projected to increase further in the future, driving additional impacts on health, society, and ecosystems."

 Air pollution affects the health of people and therefore monitoring of the air quality is important both for the public and policy makers. Efficient monitoring of air quality requires a combination of measurements and modelling. Both current and annual average concentrations as well as future concentrations on all locations where people live are required. This information on exposure to pollutants can only be achieved at high spatial resolution at all locations by using air-quality models. Therefore, model calibration is a major objective in air quality measurement strategies. Measurement results of reference instruments (or equivalent) as defined in the EU air quality directive offer a high-quality basis for model calibration and validation. Over the last years, low-cost sensors/samplers have shown a rapid development and promising results. In this paper, a statistical framework is presented to evaluate measurement strategies that apply a combination of reference measurement instruments and low-cost measurements, like diffusion tubes and sensors. For some practical situations the introduction of sensors at only twenty locations gives a significant improvement of the calibration of an air quality model. The calibration of the low-cost measurements themselves with respect to the reference instruments is critical for any application. This calibration largely determines the model quality improvement due to the addition of low-cost measurements. The results shown in this paper can be used to optimize measurement strategy using low-cost measurements and/or sensors with established performance characteristics. The results can also be used to define the quality of the low-cost measurements that is required for useful applications. Using low-cost measurements can improve the quality of the calibrated model, even with a simultaneous reduction of the number of reference instruments. I.e., improved quality of information, at reduced costs."

 Nitrate pollution is a significant contributor to poor air quality and adverse health effects, especially in NH3-rich environments. This study investigated the reduction of particulate nitrate (NO3−) in Seosan, South Korea, an NH3-rich rural area, through two intensive campaigns conducted in winter (December 15, 2020–January 15, 2021) and autumn (November 10, 2022–December 10, 2022). Results showed that NH3 played a critical role in NO3− formation, with average NH3 concentrations of 6.7 ± 3.6 μg m−3. NO3− was the most abundant secondary inorganic aerosol throughout the study, especially during PM2.5 episodes (hourly PM2.5 ≥ 50 μg m−3), demonstrating a strong correlation between excess-NH4+ and NO3− concentrations. A sensitivity analysis using the ISORROPIA-II model revealed that reducing the pH of PM2.5 below 3.0 effectively decreased the gas-particle partitioning ratio of total nitrate, emphasizing the importance of total ammonia control. Specifically, ∼65% reduction in TNH3 reduced particulate NO3− concentrations by ∼20% in winter and ∼34% in autumn, with more pronounced effects during high PM2.5 alerts. This study indicates that under NH3-rich conditions, NH3 reduction policies could be effective for alleviating NO3− pollution and substantially improving air quality in rural areas."
10.5194/amt-17-7169-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了一种利用微波辐射计观测数据反演降雨期间低层大气温度剖面的新方法。以往微波辐射计在降雨情况下通常无法准确测量大气参数，因为雨滴会严重影响信号。该研究通过选择特定的频率和仰角，并排除某些频率和天顶观测，有效地降低了雨滴的影响，从而成功反演了降雨期间的低层温度剖面。研究结果表明，该方法在降雨强度小于2.5 mm h−1的情况下能够获得较好的精度，为提高天气预报和气候研究的准确性提供了新的途径。该方法的有效性通过与数值天气预报模式的对比结果进行了验证。,"['temperature profile', 'microwave radiometer', 'atmospheric remote sensing', 'rain effect', 'numerical weather prediction']",Andreas Foth;Moritz Lochmann;Pablo Saavedra Garfias;Heike Kalesse-Los,Determination of low-level temperature profiles from microwave radiometer observations during rain,"Microwave radiometers are usually not able to provide atmospheric quantities such as temperature profiles during rain. We present a method based on a selection of specific frequencies and elevation angles from microwave radiometer observations. A comparison with a numerical weather prediction model shows the presented method allows low-level temperature profiles during rain to be resolved, with rain rates of up to 2.5 mm h−1,, which was not possible before with state-of-the-art retrievals. 
 Usually, microwave radiometer observations have to be discarded during rain. The radomes of the receiver antenna get wet, which hampers accurate measurements since the retrieval algorithms to derive atmospheric quantities are not trained for rain events. The reason for the latter is, that the raindrops dominate the microwave signal compared to the weaker signal from atmospheric gases. To account for this, radiative transfer simulations need to include the electromagnetic properties of rain, which usually requires more complicated and expensive simulations. In this work, the performance of newly developed microwave radiometer retrievals that are not based on rain simulations is evaluated to assess how they work during rain events. It is shown that it is possible to retrieve low-level temperature profiles during rain by omitting certain frequencies and zenith observations. Retrievals with various combinations of elevation angles and frequencies are evaluated. We show that retrievals based on scanning mode observations with angles below 30° without zenith observation and only the less transparent upper four HATPRO microwave radiometer frequencies of the V-band (54.94, 56.66, 57.3, 58 GHz) provide the best results. An analysis of the calculated degrees of freedom of the signal shows that the retrieval of temperature profiles up to 3 km for no rain, 1.5 km for light to moderate rain, and 1 km for very heavy rain is driven by the HATPRO observation and not by climatology. Finally, the performance of the temperature profile retrieval is explained using a case study in Lindenberg, Germany, and evaluated with temperature profiles from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model for different rainfall intensities. The results show that the higher the rainfall rate, the larger the deviation of the retrieved microwave radiometer temperature profile from the ECMWF model output. The proposed retrievals for temperature profiles up to at least 1.5 km for rain rates below 0.5 and below 2.5 mm h−1 have uncertainties of less than 1 and 2 K, respectively, compared to ECMWF model output profiles."

Retrievals from a machine learning algorithm are used to provide a priori states, and a radiative transfer model is used to create lookup tables for later iteration processes. The new method combines the advantages of traditional and machine learning algorithms, and it is applicable to both daytime and nighttime conditions. 
 While traditional thermal infrared retrieval algorithms based on radiative transfer models (RTMs) could not effectively retrieve the cloud optical thickness of thick clouds, machine-learning-based algorithms were found to be able to provide reasonable estimations for both daytime and nighttime. Nevertheless, stand-alone machine learning algorithms are occasionally criticized for the lack of explicit physical processes. In this study, RTM simulations and a machine learning algorithm are synergistically utilized using the optimal estimation (OE) method to retrieve cloud properties from thermal infrared radiometry measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In the new algorithm, retrievals from a machine learning algorithm are used to provide a priori states for the iterative process of the OE method, and an RTM is used to create radiance lookup tables that are used in the iteration processes. Compared with stand-alone OE, the cloud properties retrieved by the new algorithm show an overall better performance by using statistical a priori information obtained by the machine learning algorithm. Compared with the stand-alone machine-learning-based algorithm, the radiances simulated based on retrievals from the new method align more closely with observations, and physical radiative processes are handled explicitly in the new algorithm. Therefore, the new method combines the advantages of RTM-based cloud retrieval methods and machine learning models. These findings highlight the potential for machine-learning-based algorithms to enhance the efficacy of conventional remote sensing techniques."

Gijsbert Tilstra;Ad Stoffelen;Damien Josset;Piet Stammes,Aeolus lidar surface return (LSR) at 355 nm as a new Aeolus Level-2A product,"The Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN) on the Aeolus satellite was the first of its kind to measure high-resolution vertical profiles of aerosols and cloud properties from space. We present an algorithm that produces Aeolus lidar surface returns (LSRs), containing useful information for measuring UV reflectivity. Aeolus LSRs matched well with existing UV reflectivity data from other satellites, like GOME-2 and TROPOMI, and demonstrated excellent sensitivity to modeled snow cover. 
 The Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN) aboard Aeolus was the first spaceborne high-resolution lidar and measured vertical profiles of aerosol optical properties at 355 nm at an incidence angle of ∼ 35°. Although Aeolus was primarily developed to provide vertical profiles of wind speed, aerosols and cloud products, its lidar surface returns (LSRs) have been shown to contain useful information about ultraviolet (UV) surface reflectivity and have agreed well with passive remote sensing reflectance. With a focus on the process to incorporate the LSR algorithm into the Aeolus Level-2A product, we describe the methodology and evaluate the results of the adopted LSR retrieval. The algorithm combines attenuated backscattering parameters (Level-2 Aeolus Profile Processor Algorithm, L2 AEL-PRO, data) with information on the surface bin detection (Level-1 data) to produce attenuated LSR estimates (e.g., surface-integrated attenuated backscatter) for all bins where the ground was detected. The correction for producing final LSR estimates at the original Aeolus resolution is performed using the Aeolus L2 retrievals, namely, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Rayleigh optical depth, to ensure that LSRs are free of the effects of atmospheric attenuating features, such as optically thick clouds and thick aerosol conditions (AOD > 1.0). The evaluation shows that Aeolus LSR estimates produced using this approach agree well with the UV Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (LER) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2; LERG) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI; LERT) climatologies at all spatial scales. For four reference orbits (10 September 2018, 30 November 2018, 11 January 2019 and 1 May 2019), all cloud and aerosol-free LSR estimates agree well with both LER references, with correlation coefficient (r) values varying from 0.55 to 0.71. For monthly scales, the agreement was moderate to high for the LSR–LERT  comparison (r = 0.61–0.77 depending on the month) and weak to moderate for the LSR–LERG comparison (r = 0.44–0.64). Globally, the averaged 2.5° × 2.5° LSR estimates exhibit very high agreement with both the LERG (0.90) and LERT (0.92) references. With respect to reproducing the regional monthly dynamics, LSR and LER agree very well in snow- or ice-covered regions (r > 0.90), semiarid regions (r > 0.90), arid regions (r > 0.70), and some regions with mixed vegetation (like Australia; r = 0.94), whereas no agreement was found for ocean regions due to the Aeolus optical setup, which is favorable for the ocean subsurface but not for direct surface backscatter probing. We unveiled four reflectivity clusters of LSRs at the 2.5° × 2.5° grid scale, manifesting a transition from white to darker surfaces in descending LSR magnitude order: (1) ice, (2) snow, (3) surface without snow and (4) water. Regionally, the LSR–LER agreement can vary and yields the highest correlation values in regions where snow is present in winter, indicating the excellent sensitivity of Aeolus LSRs to white surfaces such as snow. This finding is corroborated by the very good agreement of LSRs with modeled snow cover that we demonstrated (r = 0.62–0.74 between these parameters in such regions), while the sensitivity to purely vegetation-driven changes in the surface is lower, as indicated by the comparison between LSRs and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) without snow (r < 0.30 in the regional analysis). By demonstrating the usability of LSRs for scientific applications at non-nadir angles, our work deepens the knowledge about LSRs, which has mostly been based on nadir-looking Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) studies in the past. Using experiences from both the nadir-looking CALIPSO and the highly non-nadir Aeolus mission, a framework for the effective LSR utilization using future lidar missions such as EarthCARE and Aeolus-2 can be effectively designed."

This study employs observational data and ERA5 reanalysis to diagnose the phenomenon, revealing that temperature anomalies at 300 hPa are mainly driven by advection and adiabatic processes, which is the second highest recorded from 2000 to 2020. However, diabatic process are significantly important at 700 hPa, being the third highest during the period. The reduction in sea ice, combined with enhanced sinking motion and increased sea‐air temperature difference, together contributes to the variations of diabatic heating. The increased precipitation, exceeding the historical average by 100% along the southwestern shore of Prydz Bay, further induces localized warming. The increased atmospheric pressure associated with the negative Southern Annular Mode phase is the primary cause influencing the advection, adiabatic, and diabatic processes."

This is partly because there is no sensor to measure SWE beyond local scale. At Mt. Zugspitze, Germany, a superconducting gravimeter senses the gravity effect of the seasonal snow, reflecting the temporal evolution of SWE in a few kilometers scale radius. We used this new observation to evaluate two configurations of the Alpine3D distributed snow model. In the default run, the model was forced with meteorological station data. In the second run, we applied precipitation correction based on an 8 m resolution snow depth image derived from satellite observations (Pléiades). The snow depth image strongly improved the simulation of the snowpack gravity effect during the melt season. This result suggests that satellite observations can enhance SWE analyses in mountains with limited infrastructure."

We found that the timing of the O/N2 equinox transition from winter to summer or vice versa exhibits a progression with latitude, particularly, near spring equinox. The O/N2 equinox transition is far slower during spring compared to fall, leading to a remarkable seasonal asymmetry. Ionospheric Connection Explorer observed a prominent asymmetry in the summer‐to‐winter circulation in the middle to upper thermosphere, implying that the inter‐hemispheric circulation plays a crucial role in the O/N2 equinox transition. Additionally, since the wave‐driven meridional circulation in the lower thermosphere displays a seasonal asymmetry between the northward‐to‐southward and southward‐to‐northward transitions, we would anticipate that the O/N2 equinox transition is also influenced by the lower atmospheric forcing."

Results demonstrate that integrating GIIRS clear‐column radiances can enhance the precision of cloud phase classification and the retrieval of cloud macro‐physical properties. This effectively replaces the role of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles, which are typically required for thermal infrared remote sensing retrieval. Moreover, the issue of delayed acquisition of ERA‐5 atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles is mitigated, enabling near real‐time and all‐day retrieval of cloud macro‐physical properties."
10.1029/2024JD040917,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了在成分变化的大气（例如地球的热层和其他行星大气）中，Eliassen-Palm (EP)通量和Bretherton-Garrett (BG)守恒方程的适用性。研究发现，标准的BG/EP守恒方程在成分变化时不再成立，因为它们假设平均状态熵和压力之间存在固定的联系，而这种联系在成分变化时会失效。因此，论文推导出了新的熵修正(EC)形式的方程，这些方程在成分变化的大气中守恒总能量和动量。论文通过三种独立的推导方法得到了相同的EC方程形式及其相关的诊断，例如非加速条件。由于EC形式是对标准BG/EP方程的修正比例因子，因此现有的模型和诊断很容易推广。热层计算结果表明，EC方程消除了高达40%的系统能量和动量偏差，这反过来又导致稳定守恒波的振幅随着高度的增加而增长得更快。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它直接涉及大气成分分析（特别是热层成分），并对理解大气波的能量和动量传输具有重要意义，这对于改进大气模型和卫星观测数据的解释至关重要。,"['Thermospheric composition', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Satellite observations', 'Wave action', 'Energy and momentum conservation', 'Air density']",Stephen D. Eckermann,"Wave Action Conservation, Eliassen‐Palm Flux and Nonacceleration Conditions Within Atmospheres of Variable Composition","The foundational conservation equations of Eliassen and Palm (EP) and Bretherton and Garrett (BG) governing the pseudomomentum and action of waves in geophysical fluids are shown to be approximations that do not hold generally within atmospheres of varying mass composition, such as the Earth's thermosphere and other planetary atmospheres. Standard BG/EP conservation equations assume a fixed connection between mean‐state entropy and pressure that breaks down when composition varies. New entropy‐corrected (EC) forms of these equations are derived that conserve total energy and momentum in atmospheres where composition varies. Three separate and largely independent derivations are presented that all lead to the same EC forms of these equations and their associated diagnostics, such as nonacceleration conditions. Since EC forms present as corrective scaling factors to standard BG/EP equations, existing models and diagnostics are easily generalized. Representative thermospheric calculations reveal that the EC equations remove systematic energy and momentum biases of up to 40% that in turn lead steady conservative waves to grow more rapidly in amplitude with increasing altitude."

This study is based on the comparison between global climate simulations (ARPEGE‐Climat) and reference aerosol data sets (reanalyzes, ground‐based observations and satellite data). First, our results demonstrate the need to constrain the injection heights in the model in order to realistically represent extinction vertical profiles observed during fire events, both in the troposphere and in the lower stratosphere due to the contribution of pyro‐convection. Without specific vertical emission profiles for fires, the ARPEGE‐Climat simulations fail in representing aerosol extinction vertical profiles. For each region studied, the modeled aerosol optical depth (AOD) is extremely high (above 3 at 550 nm). An important long‐range transport of BBA emitted in Australia and California is shown, with high AOD further from sources. These extremely dense plumes significantly perturb the surface incident solar radiation and exert a large direct (surface) shortwave radiative effect up to −13, −29 and −17 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ on monthly average over Australia (January 2020), California (September 2020) and Siberia (August 2019), respectively. A noteworthy positive BBA direct radiative effect (warming) is found at the top of the atmosphere, when dense and strongly absorbing smoke plumes are advected over cloudy oceanic regions, characterized by high surface albedo. This absorption leads to an increase of the solar heating rate up to 0.3 K day−1 ${\text{day}}^{-1}$ with possible implications on the atmospheric temperature and dynamics."

 The responses of South Asian Monsoon (SAM) circulation under global warming are known to be highly uncertain, leading to the widespread of SAM rainfall projections among models. Here, we show that the uncertain SAM circulation in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models consists of two robust components that partly offset each other: a weakening component linked to a global thermodynamic constraint and a northward shift component understood through a regional 2D energetic perspective. We further attribute the robust northward shift of SAM circulation to positive cloud feedback over the Eurasia Continent and heat uptake in the Southern Ocean. A set of climate model simulations supports the finding that SAM rainfall increase is primarily due to the northward shift of circulation driven by extratropical processes. This energetic perspective opens new avenues for predicting monsoon rainfall by connecting circulation changes to radiative forcing, feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake."

 The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Tripole (IOT) represent primary modes of interannual variability in the Indian Ocean, impacting both regional and global climate. Unlike the IOD, which is closely related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), our findings unveil a substantial influence of the Australian Monsoon on the IOT. An anomalously strong Monsoon induces local sea surface temperature (SST) variations via the wind-evaporation-SST mechanism, triggering atmospheric circulation anomalies in the eastern Indian Ocean. These circulation changes lead to changes in oceanic heat transport, facilitating the formation of the IOT. Our analysis reveals a strengthening connection between the Australian Monsoon and the IOT in recent decades, with a projected further strengthening under global warming. This contrasts with the diminished coupling between ENSO and IOD in recent decades from observations and model projections, illustrating evolving Indian Ocean dynamics under the warming climate."

 HFC-23 (trifluoromethane) is a potent greenhouse gas released to the atmosphere primarily as a by-product of HCFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane) synthesis. Since 2020, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol has required Parties to destroy their HFC-23 emissions to the extent possible. Here, we present updated HFC-23 emissions estimated from atmospheric observations. Globally, emissions fell to 14.0 ± 0.9 Gg yr-1 in 2023 from their maximum in 2019 of 17.3 ± 0.8 Gg yr-1, but remained five times higher than reported in 2021. Atmospheric observation-based emissions for eastern China, the world’s largest HCFC-22 producer, were also found to be substantially higher than 2020-2022 reported emissions. We estimate that potential HFC-23 sources not directly linked to HCFC-22 production explain only a minor, albeit highly uncertain, fraction of this discrepancy. Our findings suggest that HFC-23 emissions have not been destroyed to the extent reported by the Parties since the implementation of the Kigali Amendment.

 The transboundary impacts of regional war on global food trade remain underexplored, particularly regarding disruptions to production and trade networks. Here we address this gap by developing a rapid assessment framework that integrates remote sensing, policy monitoring, and network analysis to evaluate the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war on global winter cereal production and trade. Using satellite data, we estimated yield reductions for wheat, barley, and oats and analyzed the effects of export-ban policies enacted since February 24, 2022. Our findings indicate that lower- and middle-income countries were disproportionately impacted, as trade networks became fragmented, forming isolated clusters that threatened food accessibility. Geographically distant countries experienced greater disruptions than those near the conflict. This framework provides insights into the cascading effects of conflict on global food systems and offers a predictive tool for policymakers to address food availability challenges during future crises.

 Benguela Niños are episodes of unusual El Niño-like warming in the upwelling zone off the coast of southwest Africa, with consequential impacts on marine ecosystems, coastal fisheries and regional weather. The strongest Benguela Niño in the past 40 years occurred in February–April 1995 with local sea surface temperature anomalies up to 4 °C off the coast of Angola and Namibia. Here, we show that a strong Indian Ocean Dipole in September–November 1994 helped boost the amplitude of the 1995 Benguela Niño through a land bridge involving Congo River discharge. We use atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological data to demonstrate the sequential linkage between Indian Ocean Dipole development, unusually high rainfall in the Congo River basin, high Congo River discharge, low salinity near the Congo River mouth, and southward advection of this low salinity water into the Benguela upwelling region. The low salinity water isolated the surface mixed layer from the thermocline, which limited vertical mixing with colder subsurface waters and led to enhanced sea surface temperature warming. We also discuss how other Indian Ocean Dipole events may have similarly affected subsequent Benguela Niños and the possibility that Indian Ocean Dipole impacts on Benguela Niños may become more prominent in the future.

Despite the fact that the NH3 source partitioning did not greatly change along the vertical transect, we observed that the abundance of NH3 continuously increased from the ground to the upper mixing layer (∼570 m). Supported by chemical transport-model simulations and auxiliary field measurements, our data indicate that vertical transport of urban NH3 emissions represents an important modulating control with regards to the observed vertical pattern of NH3 concentrations and δ15N-NH3."

 Paleoclimatic measurements serve to understand Earth System processes and evaluate climate model performances.

Statistical interpolation methods are the prevalent techniques to grid such data, but these purely data-driven approaches sometimes produce results that are incoherent with our knowledge of the physical world. Physics-Informed Neural Networks follow an innovative approach to data analysis and physical modeling through machine learning, as they incorporate physical principles into the data-driven learning process. Here, we develop a machine-learning algorithm to reconstruct global maps of atmospheric dust surface deposition fluxes from paleoclimatic archives for the Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum periods. We design an advection-diffusion equation that prevents dust particles from flowing upwind. Our physics-informed neural network improves on kriging interpolation by allowing variable asymmetry around data points.

 Ozone is a crucial greenhouse gas, ranking third only to carbon dioxide and methane, and it regulates the environment and climate change. Researchers' interest in stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) has grown recently, and the increase in tropospheric ozone due to STE processes is particularly important, leading to the excess ozone having a detrimental impact on both population health and the local climate. A major factor driving vertical ozone transport is the re-distribution of vertical momentum resulting from Anticyclonic Wave Breaking (AWB) in the Upper Troposphere Lower Stratosphere (UTLS). However, how the interannual trends of AWB frequency can influence the ozone vertical distribution, and what the interaction mechanism between the two in UTLS are still open questions. Focusing on the Northeast Asia region, where has the greatest influence on near-surface high ozone concentrations in Eastern China, a composite analysis is performed using the ERA5 reanalysis data to discuss the effect of AWB on ozone distribution and its changing trend. The result reveals that, after 2000, AWB frequency (UTLS ozone portion) shows an inter-annual decreasing (increasing) trend. Both are opposite to their inter-annual trends before 2000. i.e. AWB frequency (UTLS ozone portion) shows increasing (decreasing) from 1979 to 2000. Strong anti-correlation of AWB frequency and UTLS ozone portion appears in the upper-troposphere (UT) and lower-stratosphere (LS) before and after 2000, respectively. This phenomenon could be related to the ozone vertical transport weakening caused by declining AWB frequency trends. Additionally, the observed sustained elevation of the tropopause also increases the downward transport distance of stratospheric ozone. The transport of stratospheric ozone to the near-surface seems impeded. Considering the crucial effects of STE on ozone pollution episodes, the long-term changes for the ozone portion in UTLS caused by AWB deserve further study, which can help assess future ozone's potential social and economic effects due to stratospheric intrusion."

 The transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the measurement site leads to significant photochemical consumption, directly impacting ozone (O3) formation. To address this issue, a comprehensive observation campaign was conducted from May 1 to September 30, 2021, in Zibo, China. Using the Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM), the impact of photochemical consumed VOCs (C-VOCs) on O3 sensitivity was evaluated based on initial VOCs (In-VOCs). The results indicate that the average concentration of C-VOCs was 5.8 ± 8.3 ppbv, accounting for 9.5% of the In-VOCs concentration during high-O3 periods, which was higher than that during low-O3 periods. Alkenes (including isoprene) contributed 84.6% to the C-VOCs and accounted for 91.0% of the C-OFP (ozone formation potential (OFP) of C-VOCs), followed by aromatics. Isoprene, 1,3-butadiene, m/p-xylene, 1-butene, and propylene were identified as key species contributing to C-OFP. Three methods assessed the impact of including or excluding C-VOCs on O3 formation. Based on the VOCs/NOx indicator, the proportion of the NOₓ-limited regime was underestimated by 14%∼21% for the high-O3 periods and 18%∼21% for the low-O3 periods without considering C-VOCs. Compared to the results of the measured VOCs (M-VOCs), the relative incremental reactivity (RIR) value of NOx increased significantly for both high and low-O3 periods when considering C-VOCs, while the RIR value of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOC) showed a reverse trend. The RIR(NOx)/RIR(AVOC) results indicated that the O3 formation regime shifted from VOC-limited or transitional to NOx-limited, which is consistent with the result from the empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA). Emission reduction modeling suggested reducing AVOC and NOx at a 1:3 ratio as an effective O3 mitigation strategy. This work reveals that the NOx limitation in controlling O3 generation in this region will be underestimated without considering C-VOCs, emphasizing the importance of C-VOCs in the formulation of O3 reduction strategies."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107873,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了利用全球降水测量计划（GPM）卫星数据监测台风降水的有效性。具体来说，文章利用GPM的双频降水雷达（DPR）和微波成像仪（GMI）数据分析了2015年台风“彩虹”的降水率和潜热垂直分布特征，并基于高密度地面雨量站观测数据评估了GPM多卫星综合反演产品（IMERG）的性能。研究结果表明，DPR数据能够有效监测台风降水，IMERG产品能够捕捉台风降水的时空演变，但在低降水率估计过高，高降水率估计过低，且区域降水总量存在高估现象。此外，研究还发现增加雨量站密度可以提高卫星产品精度评估的可靠性。总而言之，本研究关注的是利用卫星遥感技术监测台风降水，属于大气环境遥感技术范畴，与大气水汽和降水等大气成分分析密切相关。,"['precipitation', 'typhoon', 'satellite remote sensing', 'GPM', 'IMERG', 'DPR', 'GMI', 'rain gauge', 'latent heat', 'atmospheric water vapor']",Xue Li;Lingfang Chen;Yangbo Chen;Ruihao Zhang;Zhihua Zhu;Hui Yin;Baolin Jiang,Assessing the use of GPM DPR and IMERG products for Typhoon Mujigae over the southern coastal provinces of China,"•Analyzed vertical profiles of precipitation and latent heat in Typhoon Mujigae using 2 A-DPR, showing post-landfall changes. •Increased rain gauge density improves evaluation accuracy, reduces local outliers and enhances evaluation robustness. •Studied spatiotemporal precipitation patterns in Typhoon Mujigae, focusing on intensity changes and spatial variability. 
 Typhoons are significant weather phenomena in China, often resulting in floods, inland waterlogging, and significant losses of life and property. Satellite remote sensing techniques provide valuable data on the cloud and precipitation structures of typhoons, as well as their temporal and spatial rainfall distributions. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive evaluation studies assessing the effectiveness of the new generation Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Level-2 and Level-3 products in monitoring typhoons. In this study, GPM satellite multifrequency microwave imager (GMI) and dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) data were utilized to analyze the precipitation rate and latent heat vertical distribution characteristics of Typhoon Mujigae (No. 1522), which occurred in 2015. Additionally, the performance of the GPM IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) product (V06) was evaluated based on high-density station precipitation observations. The analysis shows that 2 A-DPR data are valuable for typhoon precipitation monitoring, revealing significant heterogeneity in precipitation rates and latent heat release within typhoons. GPM products capture spatiotemporal rainfall evolution but overestimate low rates and underestimate high rates, with IMERG Final Run notably overestimating regional rainfall. IMERG products show moderate correlation (R: 0.44–0.47) and errors (RMSE: 2.21–2.47 mm/h). Early Run and Late Run products are preferred for their shorter latency and higher accuracy. Evaluations based on dense rain gauge data indicate that increasing the number of stations can help reduce errors and local anomalies, thereby improving the reliability of satellite accuracy assessments."

This study analyzes 28 TC remote precipitation (TRP) events occurring over South China during the pre‐summer rainy season (April to June) from 1979 to 2021, from a synoptic climatology perspective. On average, TRP events persisted for about 3 days, with primary precipitation centers identified in northeastern Guangxi Province, central and coastal areas of Guangdong Province, and the region from western Fujian to central Jiangxi, resulting in above‐normal rainfall intensity in northern South China. Employing the objective classification method of the self‐organizing map, we identified three key configurations conducive to TRP occurrence, including synoptic patterns dominated by BOB TCs in conjunction with the southern branch trough (P1), the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH, P2), or the prevailing southwest monsoon (P3). P1 and P2 exhibited three precipitation centers similar to those in the overall TRP events, while P3 corresponded to weaker precipitation due to less pronounced frontogenesis, with its center located in the southern warm‐sector region of South China. Additionally, the stronger and more northerly WPSH in P2 caused a northward shift in the water vapor flux reaching South China compared to P1, enhancing the precipitation in northern South China. This study extends the perspective of TRP events in subtropical regions, holding significant implications for weather forecasts in downstream regions affected by BOB TCs."

DesRosiers;Michael M. Bell,Dynamic Vortex Height Evolution During Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification,"The vertical structure of the tropical cyclone (TC) vortex can be quantified throughout the TC life cycle via the dynamic height of the vortex (DHOV) metric, which is sensitive to the rate of decay of the tangential wind field with height. Observed storms always possessed a high DHOV value prior to periods of rapid intensification (RI). When limited to vertically‐aligned TCs where the low‐ to mid‐level vortex tilt magnitude is small, all DHOV values are found to be large enough for RI. Vortex tilt results from environmental vertical wind shear (VWS) and a similar relationship is found in an ensemble of TCs simulated in a moderate shear environment. Once vortex tilt decreases, both the observed and ensemble TCs exhibit a concurrent increase of DHOV and intensity, indicating the metric provides useful information about changing vertical structure in both tilted and aligned TCs. The growth of DHOV during RI is closely coupled with a strengthening warm core at the upper levels. A simulation with an upper‐level jet of VWS is used to better understand the importance of the upper levels during RI by disrupting vortex development there. DHOV and intensity of the TC are effectively capped in the jet simulation relative to its counterpart in a control simulation, indicating shear can limit TC height without appreciable low‐ to mid‐level tilt. Differences in kinematic and thermal structure between the jet and control runs are found from 12‐ to 16‐km altitude, suggesting the importance of warming near the tropopause in powerful TCs."

Although ship reports are susceptible to subjective interpretation, the inferred distributions of these phenomena are consistent with observations from other platforms such as satellites and coastal surface stations. These distributions highlight widespread 70‐year trends that are often consistent across both annual and seasonal frequencies, with statistical significance at 95% confidence. The relative frequency of ship‐reported drizzle has largely increased in the tropics annually and seasonally, with linear best‐fit relative increases by as much as 15% per decade. Decreased relative frequencies have been observed in parts of the subtropics and at higher latitudes. Heavier precipitation has encompassed a growing fraction of non‐drizzle precipitation reports over the subtropical North Pacific and Mediterranean. The relative frequency of thunderstorm reports has declined over the open Atlantic but show positive trends over the Mediterranean and the western Atlantic. The trends in relative frozen precipitation occurrence suggest a poleward retreat of areas receiving frozen precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere. Possible mechanisms for these ship‐observed trends are discussed and placed in the context of the modeled effects of climate change on global precipitation."

 Due to the compounding impacts of urbanization and climate change-induced warming, urban inhabitants face increasing risks of thermal health issues. The use of high-resolution maps that categorize intra-urban thermal environment and Local Climate Zones (LCZ) could enhance the understanding of the correlation between heat-related health risks and microclimates. In this study, a fine-scale heat risk assessment framework was applied in an arid megacity, Karachi, Pakistan. Following Crichton’s Risk Triangle framework, heat health risks were mapped by considering hazard-exposure-vulnerability components at the census ward level. The heat hazard was mapped using SDGSAT-1 thermal infrared data at a 30 m spatial resolution during summer season. Factors contributing most to heat vulnerability were identified as the availability of electricity facilities, bathroom facilities, and housing density, with contribution rates of 47.51 %, 21.86 %, and 8.07 %, respectively. Heat risks were considerably higher for built types (0.16) compared to natural LCZ types (0.07), with 65 % of LCZ 2, 3, 6, and 7 (compact mid-rise, compact low-rise, open low-rise, and lightweight low-rise areas) identified as high-risk areas. To mitigate heat risks, green space should be planned in LCZ2 and LCZ3 characterized by dense population and compact buildings arrangement, and public cooling facilities and infrastructure should be improved in LCZ7 featured with squatter and slum settlements. Urban planners may consider restricting the growth of these areas in newly-developed regions, including encroachments and unplanned settlements, to prevent further exacerbation of heat stress. This study offers a valuable guide for assessing and alleviating heat risks at the community level, thereby promoting the development of heat resilient urban areas."

 Sub-micron aerosols primarily comprise of organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride. Of these, organics have high complexity in their chemical and physical characteristics. In this study, aerosol volatility of non-refractory sub-micron aerosol was studied using a thermal denuder (at a constant temperature of 150 °C) coupled High-Resolution Time of flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-TOF AMS) for the period from 6th to 26th February 2021. Nitrate and ammonium had the highest volatility (80 % and 68 %, respectively), followed by organics (54 %). The lowest volatility rate was observed for sulfate (26 %) indicating the tendency of sulfate aerosols to be more in the particle phase at higher temperatures. The volatility for organics decreases during afternoon and midnight hours due to the prevalence of secondary organic aerosol. Further positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis on both the denuded and ambient organics aerosol revealed four factors, namely, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), biomass-burning organic aerosol (BBOA), semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SV-OOA), and low-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (LV-OOA). Over the campaign, LV-OOA showed an increase in fractional contribution from 31 % to 56 % of total organics. SV-OOA, HOA, and BBOA showed decreasing trends, as they have higher volatility than LV-OOA. Surprisingly, SV-OOA exhibited higher volatility than that of HOA, and BBOA. Further, the volatility of oxygenated hydrocarbon peaks was compared with hydrocarbon peaks to assess the higher volatility of SV-OOA aerosols, and the oxygenated hydrocarbons were estimated to be more volatile than hydrocarbons. The present study highlighted the possible coating of SV-OOA over the existing aerosols which may modulate the aerosol to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation characteristics."

Our results reveal a trend reversal in global averaged DTR around 1988, shifting from a decrease to an increase, affecting 47% of global land areas. Subsequent to the reversal, the most pronounced increases were observed in temperate regions. Seasonal analysis shows earlier reversals in spring and summer, with accelerated change rates following the reversal. Additionally, increased surface solar radiation from reduced cloud cover caused daily maximum (Tmax) temperatures to warm faster than the minimum (Tmin), leading to a reversal and intensified DTR.

It is much larger between 30° $30{}^{\circ}$ and 50° $50{}^{\circ}$ geomagnetic latitudes and keeps increasing until 22:00–00:00 LT.

This investigation suggests that an upward ionospheric expansion likely took place in a direct consequence to the contrasting low dynamic/magnetic pressure and relatively higher nightside ionospheric pressure (by 1–2 orders) causing an increased ionospheric density. Moreover, the day‐to‐night plasma transport may also be a contributing factor to the increased plasma density.

Foltz;Alex Sen Gupta,Global Predictability of Marine Heatwave Induced Rapid Intensification of Tropical Cyclones,"Prediction of the rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) is crucial for improving disaster preparedness against storm hazards. These events can cause extensive damage to coastal areas if occurring close to landfall. Available models struggle to provide accurate RI estimates due to the complexity of underlying physical mechanisms. This study provides new insights into the prediction of a subset of rapidly intensifying TCs influenced by prolonged ocean warming events known as marine heatwaves (MHWs). MHWs could provide sufficient energy to supercharge TCs. Preconditioning by MHW led to RI of recent destructive TCs, Otis (2023), Doksuri (2023), and Ian (2022), with economic losses exceeding $150 billion. Here, we analyze the TC best track and sea surface temperature data from 1981 to 2023 to identify hotspot regions for compound events, where MHWs and RI of tropical cyclones occur concurrently or in succession. Building upon this, we propose an ensemble machine learning model for RI forecasting based on storm and MHW characteristics. This approach is particularly valuable as RI forecast errors are typically largest in favorable environments, such as those created by MHWs. Our study offers insight into predicting MHW TCs, which have been shown to be stronger TCs with potentially higher destructive power.

This study examined NOCs from dung and bitumite combustion in the TPL and their atmospheric oxidation by hydroxyl (·OH) and nitrate (·NO3) radicals using an integrated experimental and theoretical approach. Dung produced higher NOC emissions, mainly methyl types, while bitumite emitted more fused‐ring NOCs. Exposure to intense solar radiation resulted in substantial photobleaching of methyl NOCs through hydroxyl (·OH) reactions, reducing the maximum molar absorption at 300–400 nm wavelengths by 76.9%–96.4%. Moreover, nitrate radical (·NO3) oxidation maintained spectral characteristics while producing minor absorption decreases of 48.9%–58.8%. The oxidative aging of fused‐ring NOCs exhibited structure‐dependent responses, wherein both ·NO3 and ·OH oxidation induced photo‐enhancement effects proportional to the number of aromatic rings in the molecular structure. Oxidation generally reduced radiative forcing for methyl NOCs but enhanced it for fused‐ring NOCs, particularly through ·OH reactions, which increased simple forcing efficiency at 300–400 nm by 43.7%. This study provides crucial insights into NOCs' effects on regional climate and air quality, emphasizing the need for source‐specific considerations in atmospheric models for TPL's unique high‐altitude environment."

During the development of Hinnamnor, its energy growth rate (EGR) continuously increases as RI progresses. After Hinnamnor reaches its maximum intensity, although its EGR weakens a little, it remains relatively large. If it had not been for the influence of the external environment (such as the tropical depression), its maximum intensity would have been far greater than the actual maximum intensity (140 knots). As the WISHE effect progressively weakens, the number of convective bursts (CBs) gradually diminishes. This, in turn, gives rise to a corresponding weakening of the warm core and a subsequent delay in the start time of the axisymmetrization of the inner core, thereby affecting the intensification rate of the vortex and the final maximum intensity. Consequently, the start time of RI is also correspondingly postponed. Differing from the maximum potential intensity theory, when the EGR approaches zero, a TC does not immediately reach its maximum intensity. Instead, it attains its peak intensity approximately 12 hr later. During this additional 12 hr period, the number of CBs continues to increase, the warm core keeps on strengthening and the inner core continues its progress toward axisymmetric until the end of the RI process. This indicates that the dynamical and thermodynamical processes are also of great importance during the RI stage."

 Western Europe experienced an unprecedentedly hot July in 2022, which significantly impacted ecosystems and society. Our observational and numerical modeling study reveals that this event was influenced by anomalous North Atlantic and Eurasian jet streams. The northeastward shift of the North Atlantic jet stream, driven by sea surface temperature gradients, and the curving of the Eurasian jet stream, affected by rainfall anomalies in Pakistan, enhanced atmospheric subsidence over western Europe. This research highlights the crucial role of the synergistic behavior of the North Atlantic and Eurasian jet streams in driving extreme heat over Western Europe. Furthermore, CMIP6 climate model projections suggest that under the SSP585 scenario, similar jet stream configurations could lead to even more intense extreme temperatures (~7.02 ± 0.61 °C) compared to the current climatological mean."

 Land surface temperature (LST) serves as a crucial indicator of the thermal state and environmental changes on the Earth’s surface, and it can be retrieved effectively from satellite thermal infrared sensors. Although algorithms for retrieving LSTs have been developed successfully for many satellites, the newly launched Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), which includes three thermal infrared bands, does not yet include effective LST algorithms and parameters. Here, parameters are calibrated for retrieving LSTs from SDGSAT-1 Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) data for the split-window (SW) method and the three-channel (TC) method under both daytime and nighttime conditions. In this process, the Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) dataset and observation data from the University of Wyoming were used. Validations were conducted using in situ LST measurements at the Guantao, Turpan, and Heihe sites in China and from the Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) network in North America, covering cropland, desert and bare land, and grassland. The overall accuracies of the models are fairly good, with RMSEs of 2.507 K and 2.272 K for split-window method during daytime and nighttime respectively, and 2.847 K and 1.923 K for three-channel method. Additionally, the LST retrieval models that use observation data from the University of Wyoming had higher accuracy than those using the TIGR2000 profiles. Currently, the proposed models can be applied under different atmospheric water vapor contents and underlying surface conditions both during the day and at night, paving the way for retrieving LST products from SDGSAT-1."

 Quantifying the urban heat island (UHI) effect and its impact on summer heat-related risk is important for both urban environment and human well-being. Existing studies frequently adopt the static (fixed) urban boundary to define urban/rural area in UHI measurement, overlooking the exacerbation of the urbanization-induced warming during long-term urban expansion and the consequent increase in urban heat risks. Here we measured the global surface UHI (SUHI) intensity up to 7,554 urban patches during 2000–2015 using every five-year dynamic urban boundary, followed by a two-stage analysis based on a Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) to quantify the additional heat-related risks caused by the urbanization-induced warming. Our results show that the global average SUHI intensity increased by approximately 10 % in 15 years with distinct seasonal and diurnal variations. The global urban expansion from 2000 to 2015 resulted in an average increase of 0.61℃ (95 % CI = 0.56℃-0.66℃) in summer UHI intensity for newly built-up areas. This urbanization-induced warming further leads to a 20 % (95 % CI = 14.8 %-25.2 %) increase in summer heat relative risk (RR) on average, which implied an average increase of 20 % (95 % CI = 14.8 %-25.2 %) in annual heat-related mortality for the newly built-up areas. Furthermore, over 2.3 % of the world population would experience an RR increase greater than 10 %. This study highlights the importance of dynamic urban boundary for long-time span UHI measurements, providing a deeper understanding of the role of urbanization-induced warming on urban heat risk."

 Accurate prediction of PM2.5 levels is critical for safeguarding public health and informing environmental policies. However, forecasting remains challenging due to the complex transport of pollutants between monitoring stations and the dynamic nature of atmospheric conditions. This study introduces a new PM2.5 prediction model utilizing a dynamic wind-driven graph fusion approach that explicitly incorporates inter-station pollutant transport. By dynamically adjusting graph edge weights based on evolving wind patterns, the model captures the spatiotemporal dependencies between meteorological conditions and pollutant dispersion across multiple monitoring stations, which in turn enhances its interpretability by providing insights into the underlying relationships between environmental factors and air quality dynamics. An ablation study underscores the effectiveness of each component, particularly highlighting the impact of inter-station transport considerations on prediction accuracy. The model demonstrates superior performance, with over 70% of station-specific predictions achieving lower RMSE compared to leading models. Additionally, transfer learning techniques are employed to extend the model's scalability and efficiency, reducing the required training data by 80% and cutting training time by a factor of 50. This approach not only enhances the accuracy and interpretability of PM2.5 forecasts but also provides valuable insights into pollutant transport dynamics, offering a useful tool for air quality management and policy decision-making."

 From October 20 to November 6, 2023, Beijing (BJ) experienced a severe particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution episode. The spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5 during this pollution event were analyzed using surface measurements and satellite observations. The peak pollution levels of PM2.5 occurred on October 30 at 19:00 (186 μg/m³) and on November 1 at 21:00 (197 μg/m³). Pollutant source and Source-Receptor Relationship (SRR) were conducted using the FLEXPART model. Our results indicated that the potential source regions of PM2.5 pollution in BJ were primarily located to the southwest. Influenced by westerly winds, local emissions 1–2 h before the events and emissions from surrounding areas 9–22 h prior to the events were identified as the primary causes of the pollution episodes. Additionally, the pollution event on October 30 exacerbated the formation of the pollution event on November 1. Province-level analysis revealed that, the emissions from Hebei Province contribute the most to the peak pollution concentrations, accounting for 47% and 42% for the two peaks respectively.

 Atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5, near-surface concentrations when size is ≤ 2.5 μm) affects global climate and human health. India alone accounts for a quarter of the global PM2.5-related health burden. Studies in India, mostly in urban areas, have reported significant declines in PM2.5 concentrations because of COVID-19 lockdown. These studies did not consider the long-term PM2.5 patterns and time-lag effect (inter-yearly variations in PM2.5 concentrations carried forward from one period to another due to interannual shifts in meteorological conditions). Since the studies focused primarily on urban areas, not covering rural/remote areas where pollution may rise during lockdown, it is still unclear what impact lockdown had on statewide pollution levels in India. Here, we examine whether significant changes in fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AODf: columnar PM2.5) occurred statewide across India because of lockdown after excluding the confounding variables. We found a substantial decrease in AODf in a few (28%) states/territories. The declines were significant (ANCOVA; α = 0.05) in some Northeastern states/territories: Sikkim (29%), Arunachal Pradesh (24%), Nagaland (5%), Mizoram (4%) and Uttarakhand (3%). However, in most states/territories, AODf increased significantly because of lockdown. The lockdown-associated hardship caused more people to rely on polluting cooking fuels, thereby increasing residential emissions, particularly in rural areas. At city-level, we found significant reductions in near-surface PM2.5 concentrations due to lockdown. These declines were comparable or greater than previously reported. Also, there were significant reductions in AODf (PM2.5 concentrations) at state (city) levels resulting from previous environmental intervention measures. If not accounted, previous environmental intervention measures can significantly bias lockdown effect estimates in India."

 The Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) provides high spatiotemporal resolution Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), which is crucial for characterizing aerosol evolution on a spatial scale and supports exposure assessments and health research. The influence of clouds and high surface reflectance causes the loss of MAIAC AOD on a spatial scale, leading to inaccuracies in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) retrieval and health risk assessments over the Fenwei Plain (FWP). However, the column concentration of PM2.5 precursors has not been used to impute missing AOD. Meanwhile, a spatial downscaling model that reduces errors and higher spatial resolution needs to be developed to assist in the AOD gap-filling task. Thus, we propose a robust estimation method for imputing missing MAIAC AOD (RF-AutoResnet) using a combination of Random Forest (RF) and Autoencoder's Deep Residual Neural Network (AutoResnet). The RF model downscales the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) AOD spatially and introduces AutoResnet for AOD imputation. Compared with the Bilinear and Nearest algorithms, the RF downscaling model more accurately reflects the spatial variability of AOD, achieving better R (0.71) and lower RMSE (0.10). Scenario analysis found that in the HCHO+SO2+NO2 scenario (Simultaneously adding formaldehyde (HCHO) sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to the RF-AutoResnet model) scenario, from 2019 to 2022, the RF-AutoResnet model captured the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of AOD on a fine spatial scale for missing daily and monthly average MAIAC AOD. Compared with Bilinear-AutoResnet and Nearest-AutoResnet, the RF-AutoResnet method achieved better performance (average R2 =0.86-0.98; average RMSE =0.02-0.05; average MAE =0.01-0.02). Considering the gap-filled AOD estimated by the column concentration of PM2.5 precursors, it shows a strong correlation with the AOD of the Sun sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET) (R = 0.91, RMSE = 0.06, Bias = 0.01). These results underscore the reliability of this hybrid machine learning approach for AOD estimation. This is highly significant for improving the precision of evaluating PM2.5 effects on human health at a finer scale and enhancing the simulation and prediction capabilities of climate models."

 Understanding the transport patterns of aerosols between urban and rural areas and predicting their spatiotemporal variations is crucial. In this study, from June 2022 to December 2023, ground-based Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations were conducted in urban and rural areas of Hefei, Anhui, China. Anhui University (AHU) and Changfeng (CF) were selected as representative urban and rural sites, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the MAX-DOAS aerosol extinction measurements at the lower layer and in situ PM2.5 at AHU reached 0.720. The study found that the seasonal average aerosol profiles at AHU exhibited a Gaussian pattern, while those at CF showed both Gaussian and band-like distributions, with the maximum aerosol loading appearing within 1200 m. Seasonal average aerosol vertical profiles indicated that in spring, summer, and autumn, peak aerosol extinction values at AHU occurred approximately two hours earlier than at CF. In winter, however, peak aerosol extinction values at CF appeared about two hours earlier than at AHU. The study also revealed the phenomenon of high-altitude aerosol transport during the observation period. Typical transport cases were selected for each season: August 21, October 1, December 13, 2022, and April 9, 2023. It was found that the main aerosol transport height ranged from 300 to 1200 m, with aerosol transport fluxes ranging from 1.744 to 3.954 km−1∙m∙s−1. Potential source analysis indicated that aerosols at AHU and CF primarily originated from nearby urban areas, with significant transport from southeastern Henan, eastern Hubei, northern Jiangxi, and northwestern Zhejiang, with relatively short transport distances. Additionally, using a deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, we predicted the daily average aerosol vertical profiles at the CF from July to December 2023. The correlation between the predicted data and the actual MAX-DOAS observations at CF reached 0.750, demonstrating the model's accuracy in spatiotemporal prediction. Predicting daily average aerosol vertical profiles can provide early warnings of aerosol pollution events and support the formulation and implementation of environmental policies."

These events are driven by much stronger EB, WPSH, and SAH anomalies, indicating a more intensified circulation pattern compared to SOM1. SOM3 comprising eight events, primarily affected eastern SC. In contrast, SOM4 including two cases mainly affected western SC. Increased SC heatwaves have been linked to changing large-scale circulations and spring Barents Sea ice loss. Random Forest quantified the relative importance of different large-scale circulation factors, revealing that the reconstructed circulation pattern associated with SOM1 showed a significant enhancement, with its contribution to heatwaves increasing from 14.5 % to 47.2 % since the early 2000s. Spring Barents Sea ice loss influenced SC heatwaves by adjusting aforementioned circulations, especially after the early 2000s, supported by diagnosis and numerical experiments."
10.1029/2024EF005130,True,Earth's Future,这篇论文研究了全球城市土地扩张的统计分布及其变化趋势。研究人员利用夜间灯光数据分析了29年来全球及13个区域和国家的城市面积数据，发现城市土地扩张呈现出从幂律分布向指数分布转变的趋势，这与中等规模城市在全球城市系统中的主导地位日益增强有关。这种分布变化可能导致城市系统稳定性和复原力下降，并与城市人口面临极端高温事件和空气污染的风险增加相关。研究结果挑战了现有的城市土地利用实践，并强调了中等规模城市在城市规划中的重要性。虽然文章没有直接提及具体的空气质量监测技术或大气成分分析方法，但其研究结果与空气污染和城市热岛效应密切相关，而这些环境问题通常需要借助卫星观测和遥感技术进行监测和分析，因此与大气环境遥感技术具有很强的关联性。夜间灯光数据本身就是一种遥感数据，可以作为监测城市扩张和相关环境影响的指标。,"['air pollution', 'nighttime lights', 'satellite observation', 'urban heat island', 'urban expansion']",Shengjie Hu;Zhenlei Yang;Sergio Andres Galindo Torres;Zipeng Wang;Haoying Han;Yoshihide Wada;Thomas Cherico Wanger;Ling Li,Statistical Distribution of Urban Area Reveals a Converging Trend of Global Urban Land Expansion,"Urban land expansion is a major driver of many environmental and societal changes that challenge human well‐being and sustainable development, but its evolutionary process and dynamics are neither clear nor well‐integrated into urban science quantitatively. We analyzed the global urban extent data based on nighttime lights to examine the statistical distribution of urban land area at the global scale, and in 13 regions and countries over 29 years. The results reveal a converging temporal trend in urban land expansion from subnational to global scales, characterized by a coherent shift of urban area distribution from an initial power law toward an exponential distribution. This trend is well captured by a unified mathematical model based on the shifted power law distribution function and is reflected in the gradual predominance of medium‐size cities over small‐size cities in the configuration of urban systems across the world. The shift of urban area distributions bears the consequence of reduced urban system stability and resilience, and can be linked to increasing exposure of urban populations to extreme heat events and air pollution. These changes are likely to be driven by the increasing influence of external economies of scale associated with globalization. The findings challenge the status quo of land urbanization practices and emphasize the importance of medium‐size cities in urban planning."

 Land surface temperature (LST) data with high temporal and spatial resolution are used in many studies, e.g. to assess climate changes, land–atmosphere interactions, surface energy balance, etc. However, clouds and the limitations of geostationary and polar orbiting satellites hinder the collection of high-quality thermal infrared (TIR) data. This research aims to generate hourly LST data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with four daily observations. The Multi-channel Singular Spectrum Analysis (M−SSA) algorithm was used to reconstruct lost data due to clouds in the MODIS annual LST time series. Subsequently, Fourier series analysis was employed to generate hourly LST data based on the four MODIS observations per day. The developed Fourier series model was evaluated using hourly LST data from Meteosat-9 and ground surface soil temperature data at eight different Ameriflux sites. The evaluation of the Fourier series model showed that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) between the hourly LST data from the Meteosat-9 satellite and the hourly LST data generated by the Fourier series model using four simultaneous MODIS observations averaged 1.70 Kelvin and 0.98, respectively, throughout Iran.

 Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPE) obtained from satellite data are essential for accurately assessing the hydrological cycle in both land and ocean. Early artificial Neural Networks (NN) methods were used previously either to merge infrared and microwave data or to derive better precipitation products from radar and radiometer measurements. Over the last 25 years, machine learning technology has advanced significantly, accompanied by the initiation of new satellites, such as the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission Core Observatory (GPM-CO). In addition, computing power has increased exponentially since the beginning of the 21st century. This paper compares the performance of a pure NN FORTRAN, originally designed to expedite the 2A12 TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) algorithm, with a contemporary state-of-the-art NN in Python using the TensorFlow library (NN PYTHON). The performance of FORTRAN and Python approaches to QPE using GPM-CO data are compared with the goal of achieving a minimum NN architecture that at least matches the outcome of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF) algorithm. Another conclusion is that the new NN PYTHON does not present significant advantages over the old FORTRAN code. The latter does not require dependencies, which has many practical advantages in operational use and therefore have an edge over more complex approaches in hydrometeorology."

Insights from comparing multiple gridded products with observations,"•Systematic evaluation of eight precipitation datasets against 304 stations in Greece. •Orographic effects better captured by CHELSA, CERRAL, MSWEP. •Gridded datasets aid in drought and extreme event analysis. •Consistent emerging patterns in the occurrence of heavy rainfall. 
 The spatiotemporal precipitation patterns in Greece are influenced by several factors, including the complex topography and the multifaceted climatic regimes of the country. Rain gauges, albeit a reliable tool for the accurate quantification of precipitation, are scarce, sporadic, and not properly maintained. In these instances, gridded datasets may provide a solution by administering spatially and temporally continuous precipitation data. The products, however, reveal limitations in the realistic simulation of precipitation, primarily caused by the intrinsic flaws of the underlying methods used. The assessment of eight of the most spatially and temporally detailed precipitation datasets, namely ERA5-Land (ERA5L), AgERA5, CHELSA-W5E5 v1.1 (CHELSA), MSWEP V2.8, CHIRPS05, IMERG V06 (Final), and E-OBS, compared against field observations acquired from 304 gauging stations across Greece has not been previously attempted. The evaluation is conducted on a daily and a monthly timescale, over a 32-year period (1984–2016), assessing the performance of the gridded products by considering both the country as a whole and its individual regions. The ability of the datasets to correctly portray the occurrence of extreme events and precipitation patterns is examined by statistical metrics and further insights are provided by the application and statistical analysis of climate indices on ground observations. CHELSA, CERRAL and AgERA5 consistently yield acceptable results across statistical metrics, outperforming the other datasets, which exhibit inferior performance in both temporal scales. The statistical analysis reveals distinct patterns of heavier precipitation in northern and western regions, with strong seasonal variability in the West and South and a possible average decennial increase of over 110 mm in mean annual and over 30 mm in extreme precipitation, along the assessment period. Overall, the datasets fail to accurately depict precipitable extremes, but CHELSA and CERRAL stand out as more reliable options for describing the precipitation dynamics in Greece."

However, the IMERG developers note that it is designed as a high resolution precipitation product (HRPP), not a Climate Data Record, and its ability to capture climate trends remains uncertain. Therefore, it is imperative to explore and quantify IMERG’s capability in capturing climate trends for our community. This study examines the climatological performance of IMERG Final (Version 06) by analyzing annual precipitation trends over land from 2001 to 2019 using the Mann-Kendall analysis, taking gauge records as ground truth. Three different matching strategies are applied: at gauge locations, at 0.1° pixels, and at 1.0° pixels. Additionally, this study compares the performances during the TRMM (2001–2014) and GPM eras (2015–2019). Our results find: (1) IMERG daily data exhibits high spatial consistency with gauge records at both gauge locations and 0.1° resolution, consistent with its Global Precipitation Climatology Centre calibration, with a conversion rate of approximately 89.3%; (2) IMERG performs much better overall in the GPM era than in the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) era, evidenced by a lower proportion of unreliable samples (∼10.2% vs. ∼21.2%); (3) The proportion of samples showing consistent trends with gauge data is 86.7% in the GPM era, much higher than the 70.5% and 75.3% shown by the entire record and the TRMM era, respectively. This improvement in the GPM era suggests that the within-mission consistency of IMERG is higher than the between-mission consistency, likely due to residual differences in the calibration methods used during the TRMM and GPM missions. This study broadens the perspective on IMERG, showcasing its additional potential for analyzing climate trends despite its design only as a HRPP. Crucially, it highlights and reconfirms how the GPM era has enhanced IMERG’s capacity for accurately tracking global precipitation trends."

While its influences on tropical and extratropical cyclones have been well-documented, the influence of mesoscale SSTA on polar lows (PLs) remains unexplored. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a series of sensitivity numerical experiments with different SST configurations. The simulation results indicate that, over the lifespan of a PL, SSTA does not significantly influence PL intensity but does enhance latent heat release. On a longer time scale, based on simulations of five winter seasons over the Nordic Sea, we found that the accumulated impact of mesoscale SSTA creates favorable environments for PL intensification, characterized by higher moisture levels and lower static stability. These results highlight the importance of considering high-resolution SST boundary conditions, i.e. resolving mesoscale SST, in climate simulations of PLs."

Our findings showed a clear decline in the dry deposition fluxes of aerosol-IN following the implementation of environmental laws and policies. Promoting cleaner production, using new energy vehicles, the rational use of nitrogenous fertilizers, and standardized straw burning will all reduce pollution caused by excessive nitrogen deposition. High ratios of dry deposit to river transport nitrogen (0.48–17.89) indicate aerosol-IN is a significant source of inorganic nitrogen in Chinese offshore areas. The implementation of the policy has significantly reduced aerosol-IN deposition into the ocean, but its contribution remained substantial and should be considered when protecting the Chinese marine ecological environment."

A relatively straightforward approach is to exploit the exact instantaneous character of the InSAR data in data assimilation to improve the timing of NWP model realizations. Here we show the potential impact of InSAR data on the NWP model timing and subsequently on improved model performance. By time‐shifting the model to find the best match with the InSAR data we show that we can achieve a model error reduction (one‐sigma) of up to 40% in cases where weather fronts are present, while other cases show more modest improvements. Most model performance gain due to time‐shifts can therefore be achieved in cases where weather fronts are present over the study area.

In-field collocation with Beta Attenuation Monitor found low R2 values; 0.40 for ATMOS and 0.43 for PA. To calibrate and improve the accuracy of sensors, five Machine Learning (ML) models and an empirical relative humidity correction methodology were used separately for both sensors. Out of these, the Decision Tree outperformed others, and R2 values improved to 0.996 for ATMOS and 0.999 for PA. Root mean square error reduced from 34.6 µg/m3 to 0.731 µg/m3 for ATMOS and from 77.7 µg/m3 to 0.61 µg/m3 for PA, while using DT as a calibrating model.

This paper investigates the causes of climate change on the QTP from the perspective of global atmospheric energy transport and water cycle.

Our study indicates that the QTP serves as a critical “window” for the global transport of water vapor and energy. Since 1991, the total atmospheric energy (TAE) and precipitation in the warming-wetting region of the QTP (central and northern plateau) have exhibited interdecadal growth. Furthermore, the TAE of the plateau is closely linked to the TAE and water vapor of oceans at mid-low latitudes, and even in the southern hemisphere, the increased precipitation in the warming-wetting region of the plateau has been mainly regulated by the atmospheric energy and water vapor transport structures over the equatorial western Pacific, southwestern Pacific, and southern Indian Ocean, we further reveal the energy transport channel from the warming oceanic areas of the southern and northern hemispheres to the QTP. This study deepens the novel understanding of atmospheric energy accompanying water vapor transport in the southern and northern hemispheres, which is of significant importance for understanding the responses of energy and water cycle in the warming-wetting of the QTP and global climate change."
10.1016/j.rse.2024.114574,True,Remote Sensing of Environment,这篇论文研究了卫星衍生地表温度（LST）与地面近地表气温（Tair）之间的关系，尤其关注山区地区。文章通过对已有文献进行元分析，探讨了影响LST-Tair关系的关键因素，并揭示了现有研究中的一些偏差，例如研究区域的偏向性和高海拔地区气象站的不足。研究指出，山区温度变化速度比低海拔地区更快，而LST数据可以弥补高海拔地区气象站稀疏的不足，从而更全面地评估山区温度动态，为气候变化研究提供重要数据支持。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，利用卫星观测数据研究地表温度变化，属于气候变化和环境监测的范畴。,"['Land surface temperature', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air temperature', 'Climate change', 'Mountainous regions', 'Meta-analysis']",Yaping Mo;Nick Pepin;Harold Lovell,Understanding temperature variations in mountainous regions: The relationship between satellite-derived land surface temperature and <em>in situ</em> near-surface air temperature,"•A meta-analysis review of LST-Tairrelationship globally and in mountains is given. •Key factors driving LST-Tairrelationship across varied settings are assessed. •Research shows bias towards northern mid-latitudes, especially in mountains. •Significant under-sampling of the highest elevations by weather stations is noted. 
 Mountain systems significantly influence both regional and global climates, and are vital for biodiversity, water resources, and economic activities. Many mountainous regions are experiencing more rapid temperature changes than environments at lower elevations. Whilst in situ weather stations offer critical data on near-surface air temperature (Tair) patterns, the lack of high-elevation stations may lead to an underestimation of warming in mountainous regions. Land surface temperature (LST), which has a strong relationship with Tair and can potentially be measured globally by satellites irrespective of extreme terrain, presents an important alternative for comprehensively assessing temperature dynamics. In this study, we review studies on the relationship between satellite-derived LST and in situ Tair, particularly in mountainous regions, by conducting a meta-analysis of the research literature and discussing the factors driving the LST-Tair relationship. Our review reveals several research biases, including the regions that are the focus of studies to date (e.g. hemispheric and continent biases) and the elevation ranges that have in situ Tair data. We highlight the need for further research in mountain environments to better understand the impacts of climate change on these critical regions."

 The biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) was quantified and characterized during a period of elevated emissions from residential heating at a Mediterranean urban area. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) of the measurements from a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) indicated that biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) was the dominant organic aerosol (OA) component during this period accounting for 52% of the total OA with the rest of the sources being traffic (10%), cooking (13%) and oxygenated OA (OOA 24%). One fourth (25%) of the BBOA had undergone chemical aging and was identified as aged BBOA. Organonitrates correlated highly with this aged BBOA factor. Reactions of the biomass burning emissions with nitrate radicals during nighttime appeared to be the major source of aged BBOA. Our findings strongly suggest that the BBOA estimated from AMS factor analyses in urban environments during the winter is a lower limit of the biomass burning contribution to OA. A significant fraction of the OA from biomass burning is included in the OOA factor. The average PM2.5 oxidative potential (DTTm) measured during the campaign was 14 ± 4.5 pmol min−1 μg−1, elevated during periods when BBOA chemical aging was favorable."

 Brown carbon (BrC) plays a crucial role in atmospheric radiation and global climate. Secondary brown carbon (SBrC) generated through various oxidation pathways from primary organic aerosols (POA), gas-to-particle conversion, and multiphase reactions of gas-phase precursors, is an important contributor to BrC. Most research has focused on individual formation pathways of SBrC in the laboratory, whereas little is known about its common feature in the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate that the semi-solid phase of aerosol particles when aerosol water content (AWC) is less than 15 μg/m3 facilitates the formation of SBrC in the atmosphere based on comprehensive observations from 2020 to 2022 in Beijing and experimental simulations. Field observations show that the fraction of SBrC (fSBrC) in the semi-solid phase (0.35 ± 0.20) is significantly (at 0.01 level) higher than that in the liquid phase (0.29 ± 0.19), accompanied by a larger ratio of the fraction of more-oxidized organic aerosol (MO-OOA) to less-oxidized organic aerosol (LO-OOA) (fMO-OOA/fLO-OOA) associated with the semi-solid phase than the counterpart, while the SBrC in both cases has a comparable Absorption Ångström exponent (4.45 ± 2.07). Laboratory study demonstrates that SBrC is produced at a faster rate from heterogeneous reactions between glyoxal and NH4HSO4 in the semi-solid phase simulated at 0.38 relative humidity (RH) than in the liquid phase simulated at 0.70 RH. The higher ionic strength in the semi-solid phase drives the faster formation rate of SBrC, supported by a positive correlation between the light absorption of SBrC and the ionic strength."

 Pristine Himalayan environment is being increasingly affected by the exogenous pollutants which are often observed over mountains. This study, for the first time, elucidates upon the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the concentrations of primary and secondary aerosols along with associated dynamics, across the boundaries of two regions with very different geographical features. PM2.5 measurements from northern Indian atmosphere during three distinct phases (P-I, P-II, P-III) of 2020, were investigated against previous three year's mean (2017–2019) over Delhi/NCR (DN) in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Nainital (NT) in the Central Himalaya (CH) using integrated ground based, spaceborne and reanalysis datasets. Strict lockdown measures led to a substantial reduction in PM2.5 levels in north India, with ∼62% decrease in DN and a minor ∼8% in NT region, for a couple of weeks, along with decrease in other primary absorbing aerosols (BC, OC and dust), conversely, an enhancement was observed in the scattering aerosol (SO42−). Vertical profiles of Extinction Coefficient from CALIPSO satellite revealed substantial reductions (∼60%) in aerosol content across 0–6 km, over study region with a larger decline in the foothills. Particulate depolarization ratio (PDR) and Particulate color ratio (PCR) declined with altitude by 44% and 31% respectively due to prevalence of fine particles over CH and irregular shapes near the surface (DN). In P-II, aerosol subtype occurrences changed significantly above boundary layer (2–4 km) and reduction in primary aerosols did not contribute to reducing PM2.5 concentrations. P-III exhibited enhanced secondary particle formation exacerbated by Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange (STE) events of O3 that increased the oxidizing capacity in atmosphere. Overall, an upsurge in SO42− and HNO3, was observed in CH and DN region respectively. These findings highlight the significance of secondary aerosols in reduced primary emissions and need of comprehensive case study employing box and regional chemistry models."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds (NACs) are pivotal chromophores in the light-absorbing component of organic carbon, specifically brown carbon (BrC). This study delves into the light absorption properties of 16 PAHs and 8 NACs, determining their mass absorption efficiency (MAE). Focusing on Nanchang, China, we conducted a case study from March to April 2023, examining the PM2.5's light absorption contribution, from these chromophores. Notably, Benzo[g,h,i]perylene exhibited the highest MAE at 365 nm, with values reaching 53.9 m2/g and 5-Nitrosalicylic acid at 70.7 m2/g. Our findings supplement the MAE across most PAH and NAC monomers with methanol as a solvent at 365 nm and average MAE at 300–500 nm. In Nanchang, methanol-soluble organic carbon (MSOC) demonstrated distinct light absorption coefficients on hazy versus clean days, 3.48 Mm⁻1 and 2.71 Mm⁻1 respectively, suggesting that secondary BrC formation or aging processes augment light absorption on hazy days. The Ångström exponent (AAEMSOC) of 4.85 for MSOC underscores the influence of a variety of regional pollutants and the diversity of chromophores formed through aging processes. MAEMSOC,365 was higher on clean days (3.23 m2 g−1) compared to hazy days (1.53 m2 g−1), likely attributable to MSOC's increased concentration during haze events. The light absorption contribution of PAHs at 365 nm accounted for 9.20 %, substantially exceeding their mass contribution by a factor of approximately 5.2, underscoring their dominant role. In contrast, NACs, at 2.68%, surpassed their mass contribution by a factor of 1.9, indicating a substantial yet lesser impact. This study accentuates the substantial influence of PAHs as chromophores in regional carbonaceous aerosols."

 The first comprehensive long-term observation of the variability in columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ambient Black Carbon mass concentrations (MB) was conducted at a tropical coastal location neighboring the Arabian Sea (Goa; 15.45°N, 73.83°E) between December and May in two phases: 2008–2011 (Phase I) and 2017–2021 (Phase II). Inter-seasonal (winter monsoon season (WMS): December–February; spring inter-monsoon season (SIMS): March–April; and MAY) and interphase variability in aerosol types, potential source regions, aerosol direct radiative effects (ADRE), and heating rate (HR) were investigated. The slope of spectral AOD was steeper during WMS and SIMS than MAY in both phases. Relatively flat AOD spectra with low Ångström exponent (α < 1) prevailed during all seasons in Phase I and MAY in Phase II, implying the predominance of coarse-mode aerosols. However, increasing fine-mode aerosol dominance was observed during WMS and SIMS in Phase II (mean α ∼1.5). The highest and lowest mean MB were recorded during WMS of Phase I (2904.68 ± 787.20 ng m−3), and MAY of Phase II (531.12 ± 163.95 ng m−3), respectively. Further, urban/industrial aerosols increased over 3-fold during WMS and SIMS from Phase I to Phase II. Strong potential sources of fine-mode aerosols were interspersed across the Deccan Plateau, central India, and the east coast of India during WMS of Phase II. An investigation into the sources showed that the enhancement in power generation capacities of thermal power plants was a major contributor to fine-mode anthropogenic aerosols, along with increased vehicular density and agricultural activity at upwind locations in Phase II. The sharp rise in single scattering albedo (SSA) in Phase II implied a substantial increase in scattering aerosols. ADRE in the atmosphere (ADREATM) and HR were the highest during SIMS (63.76 ± 12.99 W m−2; 1.79 ± 0.36 K day−1) in Phase I. Low ADREATM and HR were recorded during SIMS (28.20 ± 13.84 W m−2; 0.79 ± 0.39 K day−1) and MAY (36.15 ± 9.15 W m−2; 1.06 ± 0.31 K day−1) in Phase II, which can be attributed to the rapid decline in absorbing aerosols during SIMS and MAY of 2020 and 2021, coinciding with the countrywide COVID-19 lockdown."

 This study proposed a new method to retrieve aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) over land for the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) onboard the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D). Considering both accuracy and retrieval efficiency, the method combines machine learning with an aerosol optical model constructed from mixed aerosol components. A sample dataset, containing 4 bands of apparent reflectance simulated by the radiative transfer model and corresponding geometric conditions, aerosol and land surface information, is constructed for training and validating machine learning models. Three Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) SSA retrieval models are built based on the theoretical basis of SSA retrieval, and the sensitivity of SSA retrieval accuracy to input parameter errors is analyzed. The results show that BPNN-based SSA retrieval models can replace the iterative optimal solution process to a certain extent, achieving quick retrieval of satellite SSA. The BPNN SSA retrieval models are applied to FY-3D MERSI-II observations and validated using AERONET SSA products. The results indicate that the BPNN SSA retrieval model, which uses solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle, relative azimuth angle, aerosol optical depth (AOD), surface altitude, bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters (bands 1–2), and apparent reflectance (bands 1–4) as inputs, performs better than others. The retrievals show good consistency with AERONET SSA products with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.5 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.045 (0.034) at 470 nm (550 nm). In addition, more than 66 % of the SSA retrievals are within the expected error of ±0.05."
