10.5194/acp-24-11285-2024,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文主要研究了次级冰生成过程对冰粒模拟的影响。论文使用预测粒子性质（P3）微物理方案，研究了两种不同的次级冰生成过程对冰粒和冻雨模拟的影响。研究发现，次级冰生成过程增加了模拟的冰粒数量，同时减少了冻雨的数量。论文还分析了P3方案中冰粒和冰晶表示的改进，并模拟了2020年1月发生在加拿大东部的冰粒风暴。研究结果表明，添加次级冰生成过程增加了冰粒的累积量，但导致降水粒子的大小分布不现实。通过修改小冰粒对雨滴的收集和P3中冰类别的合并标准，获得了现实的冰粒大小分布。 这篇论文主要关注的是大气中的降水过程，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['ice pellets', 'freezing rain', 'microphysics', 'atmospheric model', 'secondary ice production', 'Predicted Particle Properties (P3)']",Mathieu Lachapelle;Mélissa Cholette;Julie M. Thériault,Effect of secondary ice production processes on the simulation of ice pellets using the Predicted Particle Properties microphysics scheme,"Hazardous precipitation types such as ice pellets and freezing rain are difficult to predict because they are associated with complex microphysical processes. Using Predicted Particle Properties (P3), this work shows that secondary ice production processes increase the amount of ice pellets simulated while decreasing the amount of freezing rain. Moreover, the properties of the simulated precipitation compare well with those that were measured. 
 Ice pellets can form when supercooled raindrops collide with small ice particles that can be generated through secondary ice production processes. The use of atmospheric models that neglect these collisions can lead to an overestimation of freezing rain. The objective of this study is therefore to understand the impacts of collisional freezing and secondary ice production on simulations of ice pellets and freezing rain. We studied the properties of precipitation simulated with the Predicted Particle Properties (P3) microphysics scheme for two distinct secondary ice production processes. Improvements to the representation of ice pellets and ice crystals in P3 were analyzed by simulating an ice pellet storm that occurred over eastern Canada in January 2020. Those simulations showed that adding secondary ice production processes increased the accumulation of ice pellets but led to unrealistic size distributions of precipitation particles. Realistic size distributions of ice pellets were obtained by modifying the collection of raindrops by small ice particles and the merging criteria of ice categories in P3."
10.5194/acp-24-11255-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文主要关注航空燃料对飞机排放的影响，特别是对颗粒物排放的影响。研究人员使用了一种名为 HEFA-SPK 的可持续航空燃料，并将其与传统的喷气燃料进行比较，发现 HEFA-SPK 可以显著减少飞机的颗粒物排放。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到航空燃料对大气成分的影响，并使用飞行测量和发动机模型来分析颗粒物排放。研究结果可以为航空业减少排放、改善空气质量和减缓气候变化提供参考。,"['particle emissions', 'aircraft emissions', 'sustainable aviation fuel', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Rebecca Dischl;Daniel Sauer;Christiane Voigt;Theresa Harlaß;Felicitas Sakellariou;Raphael Märkl;Ulrich Schumann;Monika Scheibe;Stefan Kaufmann;Anke Roiger;Andreas Dörnbrack;Charles Renard;Maxime Gauthier;Peter Swann;Paul Madden;Darren Luff;Mark Johnson;Denise Ahrens;Reetu Sallinen;Tobias Schripp;Georg Eckel;Uwe Bauder;Patrick Le Clercq,Measurements of particle emissions of an A350-941 burning 100 % sustainable aviation fuels in cruise,"In-flight measurements of aircraft emissions burning 100 % sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) show reduced particle number concentrations up to 41 % compared to conventional jet fuel. Particle emissions are dependent on engine power setting, flight altitude, and fuel composition. Engine models show a good correlation with measurement results. Future increased prevalence of SAF can positively influence the climate impact of aviation. 
 In order to reduce aviation's CO2 emissions and comply with current climate targets, the European Union plans a mandatory quota of 2 % sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, rising up to ≥70 % SAF by 2050. In addition to a reduction of life cycle CO2 emissions, the use of SAF can also have a positive impact on particle emissions and contrail properties. In this study we present observations from the  ECLIF3 (Emission and CLimate Impact of alternative Fuels) aircraft campaign, which investigated exhaust and contrail characteristics of an Airbus A350-941 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engines. For the first time, non-volatile and total particle emissions of 100 %  HEFA-SPK (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids–synthetic paraffinic kerosene) SAF, a blended fuel and a reference Jet A-1 fuel were measured in flight. A maximum reduction in non-volatile particle number emissions of ∼41 % compared to the reference Jet A-1 fuel was measured at low cruise engine power settings when using 100 % HEFA-SPK. The reduction decreases to ∼29 % for typical cruise engine settings and to ∼22 % at high cruise engine power settings. The size of non-volatile particles was slightly smaller for HEFA-SPK compared to Jet A-1. We show a comprehensive analysis of the hydrogen content of globally available fuels. Our results demonstrate the impact of the fuel composition in terms of its aromatic, hydrogen, and sulfur content as well as of the effect of engine power settings on particle emissions. We demonstrate that the use of HEFA-SPK can significantly reduce particle emissions and thus contrail ice particles and therefore can provide an aviation climate benefit."
10.5194/acp-24-11305-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了芬兰北部森林上空冰核粒子（INPs）的垂直分布。研究人员利用飞机观测数据分析了边界层和自由对流层中 INPs 的浓度和活性，发现地面 INPs 可以被有效地输送到边界层，并偶尔到达自由对流层。研究结果表明，生物源 INPs 在边界层中占主导地位，而自由对流层中则存在来自长距离传输的不同气溶胶。这项研究揭示了 INPs 的垂直分布对云形成和气候变化的影响，并强调了生物源气溶胶在云形成过程中的重要作用。,"['atmospheric composition', 'aerosol', 'ice nucleating particles', 'cloud formation', 'aircraft measurements', 'vertical distribution', 'boundary layer', 'free troposphere']",Zoé Brasseur;Julia Schneider;Janne Lampilahti;Ville Vakkari;Victoria A.

However, very little is known about the vertical distribution of INPs in the atmosphere. Here, we present aircraft measurements of INP concentrations above the Finnish boreal forest. Results show that near-surface INPs are efficiently transported and mixed within the boundary layer and occasionally reach the free troposphere. 
 Ice nucleating particles (INPs) play a crucial role in initiating ice crystal formation in clouds, influencing the dynamics and optical properties of clouds and their impacts on precipitation and the climate system. Despite their importance, there is limited knowledge about the vertical distribution of INPs. This study focuses on aircraft measurements conducted during spring 2018 above the boreal forest of Hyytiälä, Finland. Similarities between INP concentrations, activated fractions, particle concentrations, and size distributions observed at ground level and in the boundary layer aloft indicate that surface particles and INPs are efficiently transported and mixed within the boundary layer. INP concentrations observed in the boundary layer are best predicted by a parameterization describing near-surface INP concentrations driven by the abundance of biogenic aerosol in the Finnish boreal forest, suggesting that biogenic INPs are dominant in the boundary layer above the same environment. Most of the INP concentrations and activated fractions observed in the free troposphere are notably lower than in the boundary layer, and the distinct particle size distributions suggest that different aerosol populations, likely resulting from long-range transport, are present in the free troposphere. However, we show one case where higher INP concentrations are observed in the free troposphere and where a homogeneous particle population exists from the surface to the free troposphere. This indicates that surface particles and INPs from the boreal forest can occasionally reach the free troposphere, which is particularly important as the INPs in the free troposphere can further travel horizontally and/or vertically and impact cloud formation."
10.5194/acp-24-11275-2024,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了2023年全球变暖的快速上升，并将其归因于厄尔尼诺-南方涛动（ENSO）的自然循环。研究表明，气候模型在没有外部强迫的情况下，也能模拟出类似的快速变暖事件，但发生的概率很低。然而，当长时间的拉尼娜现象之后紧跟着厄尔尼诺现象时，这种快速变暖事件发生的概率会显著增加。研究发现，几乎所有模拟的快速变暖事件都与厄尔尼诺现象有关，这表明ENSO是驱动2023年全球变暖的主要因素。该研究没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['El Niño', 'La Niña', 'Southern Oscillation', 'global warming', 'climate models', 'surface temperature', 'interannual variability']",Shiv Priyam Raghuraman;Brian Soden;Amy Clement;Gabriel Vecchi;Sofia Menemenlis;Wenchang Yang,The 2023 global warming spike was driven by  the El Niño–Southern Oscillation,"The rapid global warming of 2023 has led to concerns that it could be externally driven. Here we show that climate models subject only to internal variability predict such warming spikes but rarely (p~1.6 %). However, when a prolonged La Niña immediately precedes an El Niño, as occurred leading up to 2023, such spikes are not uncommon (p~10.3 %). Virtually all of the spikes occur during an El Niño, strongly suggesting that internal variability drove the 2023 warming. 
 Global-mean surface temperature rapidly increased 0.29 ± 0.04 K from 2022 to 2023. Such a large interannual global warming spike is not unprecedented in the observational record, with a previous instance occurring in 1976–1977. However, why such large global warming spikes occur is unknown, and the rapid global warming of 2023 has led to concerns that it could have been externally driven. Here we show that climate models that are subject only to internal variability can generate such spikes, but they are an uncommon occurrence (p = 1.6 % ± 0.1 %). However, when a prolonged La Niña immediately precedes an El Niño in the simulations, as occurred in nature in 1976–1977 and 2022–2023, such spikes become much more common (p = 10.3 % ± 0.4 %). Furthermore, we find that nearly all simulated spikes (p = 88.5 % ± 0.3 %) are associated with El Niño occurring that year. Thus, our results underscore the importance of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in driving the occurrence of global warming spikes such as the one in 2023, without needing to invoke anthropogenic forcing, such as changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases or aerosols, as an explanation."

We have found that Aeolus and CALIPSO show similar aerosol patterns in the collocated orbits and have good agreement for the extinction coefficients for the dust aerosols, especially for the cloud-free scenes. The finding is applicable to Aeolus L2A product Baseline 17. 
 The Atmospheric LAser Doppler INstrument (ALADIN) on board Aeolus was the first high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) in space. It was launched in 2018 and re-entered in 2023. The FeatureMask (A-FM) and extinction profile algorithms (A-PRO) developed for the Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) HSRL ATmospheric LIDar (ATLID) have been adapted to Aeolus and called AEL-FM and AEL-PRO, respectively. These algorithms have been purposely built to process low signal-to-noise ratio space-based lidar signals. A short description of the AEL-FM and AEL-PRO algorithms is provided in this paper. AEL-FM and AEL-PRO prototype products (v1.7) have been evaluated using the collocated Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) vertical feature mask (VFM) product and level 2 aerosol profile product for 2 months of data in October 2018 and May 2019. Aeolus and CALIPSO are both polar-orbiting satellites, but they have different overpass times. The evaluations are focused on desert dust aerosols over Africa. These types of scenes are often stable in space (tens of kilometres) and time (on the order of 0.5–1 h), and thus, a useful number of collocated cases can be collected.We have found that the AEL-FM feature mask and the CALIPSO VFM show similar aerosol patterns in the collocated orbits, but AEL-FM does not separate aerosol and cloud features. Aeolus and CALIPSO have a good agreement for the extinction coefficients for the dust aerosols, especially for the cloud-free scenes. The Aeolus aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is larger than the CALIPSO AOT, mainly due to cloud contamination. Because of the missing a cross-polar channel, it is difficult to distinguish aerosols and thin ice clouds using the Aeolus extinction coefficients alone.The AEL-FM and AEL-PRO algorithms have been implemented in the Aeolus level 2A (L2A) processor. The findings here are applicable to the AEL-FM and AEL-PRO products in L2A Baseline 17. This is the first time that the AEL-FM and AEL-PRO products have been evaluated using CALIPSO data."

We found making accurate mixtures at very low levels challenging due to the gas sticking to cylinder walls. However, we successfully created stable mixtures at higher levels. These can be used as reliable standards for global air monitoring. More research is needed to develop methods for making accurate mixtures at lower levels. 
 Acetonitrile plays an important role in atmospheric processes and serves as a key tracer of biomass burning, the major emission source of primary carbonaceous particles and trace gases in the global atmosphere. Recognizing its significance, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) has designated acetonitrile as one of the target volatile organic compounds for global atmospheric monitoring, aiming for data quality better than 20 % accuracy and 15 % precision. Meeting the objectives of the WMO GAW program requires accurate and stable calibration standards with uncertainties of less than 5 %. In this study, we explored the feasibility of gravimetry for developing primary standard gas mixtures (PSMs) in three different types of aluminium cylinders, each with distinct internal surface treatments, at nmol mol-1 and µmol mol-1 levels with a relative expanded uncertainty of less than 5 %. We found that all three types of cylinders were inadequate, without further passivation, for developing acetonitrile PSMs below 10 nmol mol-1 due to significant adsorption losses (6 %–49 %) onto the cylinder's inner surface. To overcome this challenge, we prepared acetonitrile gas mixtures at 100 nmol mol-1 using a modified gravimetric method and at 10 µmol mol-1 using a conventional gravimetric method and then evaluated their long-term stability. Results showed that the effect of the adsorption loss at 100 nmol mol-1 and 10 µmol mol-1 was negated and negligible, respectively. Stability results show that we can disseminate acetonitrile calibration standards at both 100 nmol mol-1 and 10 µmol mol-1 with a relative expanded uncertainty of 3 % and 1 %, respectively (with an expiration period of 3 years), meeting the target uncertainty of the WMO GAW program. Further research is still needed to develop accurate and stable acetonitrile calibration standards below 10 nmol mol-1 that are closer to atmospheric levels."

VODCA v2 comprises two products: VODCA CXKu, spanning 34 years of observations (1987–2021), suitable for monitoring upper canopy dynamics, and VODCA L (2010–2021), for above-ground biomass monitoring. VODCA v2 has lower noise levels than the previous product version and provides valuable insights into plant water dynamics and biomass changes, even in areas where optical data are limited. 
 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is a model-based indicator of the total water content stored in the vegetation canopy derived from microwave Earth observations. As such, it is related to vegetation density, abundance, and above-ground biomass (AGB). Moesinger et al. (2020)  introduced the global microwave VOD Climate Archive (VODCA v1), which harmonises VOD retrievals from several individual sensors into three long-term, multi-sensor VOD products in the C, X, and Ku frequency bands, respectively. VODCA v1 was the first VOD dataset spanning over 30 years of observations, thus allowing the monitoring of long-term changes in vegetation. Several studies have used VODCA in applications such as phenology analysis; drought monitoring; gross primary productivity monitoring; and the modelling of land evapotranspiration, live fuel moisture, and ecosystem resilience.This paper presents VODCA v2, which incorporates several methodological improvements compared to the first version and adds two new VOD datasets to the VODCA product suite. The VODCA v2 products are computed with a novel weighted merging scheme based on first-order autocorrelation of the input datasets. The first new dataset merges observations from multiple sensors in the C-, X-, and Ku-band frequencies into a multi-frequency VODCA CXKu product indicative of upper canopy dynamics. VODCA CXKu provides daily observations in a 0.25° resolution for the period 1987–2021. The second addition is an L-band product (VODCA L), based on the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, which in theory is more sensitive to the entire canopy, including branches and trunks. VODCA L covers the period 2010–2021 and has a temporal resolution of 10 d and a spatial resolution of 0.25°. The sensitivity of VODCA CXKu to the upper vegetation layer and that of VODCA L to above-ground biomass (AGB) are analysed using independent vegetation datasets.VODCA CXKu exhibits lower random error levels and improved temporal sampling compared to VODCA v1 single-frequency products. It provides complementary spatio-temporal information to optical vegetation indicators containing additional information on the state of the canopy. As such, VODCA CXKu shows moderate positive agreement in short vegetation (Spearman's R: 0.57) and broadleaf forests (Spearman's R: 0.49) with the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from MODIS. VODCA CXKu also shows moderate agreement with the slope of the backscatter incidence angle relation of MetOp ASCAT in grassland (Spearman's R: 0.48) and cropland (Spearman's R: 0.46). Additionally, VODCA CXKu shows temporal patterns similar to the Normalized Microwave Reflection Index (NMRI) from in situ L-band GNSS measurements of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) and sap flow measurements from SAPFLUXNET. VODCA L shows strong spatial agreement (Spearman's R: 0.86) and plausible temporal patterns with respect to yearly AGB maps from the Xu et al. (2021) dataset. VODCA v2 enables monitoring of plant water dynamics, stress, and biomass change and can provide insights, even into areas that are scarcely covered by optical data (i.e. due to cloud cover).VODCA v2 is open-access and available at https://doi.org/10.48436/t74ty-tcx62 (Zotta et al., 2024)."

To tackle this issue, we developed a novel framework based on MEP theory. By incorporating heat storage effects and refining the Bowen ratio, we enhanced the MEP method’s accuracy. This research derives a new long-term global ocean latent heat flux dataset that offers high accuracy, enhancing our understanding of ocean energy dynamics. 
 Ocean evaporation (latent heat flux, LE) plays a crucial role in global precipitation patterns, water cycle dynamics, and energy exchange processes. However, current bulk methods for quantifying ocean evaporation are subject to significant uncertainties. The Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) theory offers a novel approach for estimating surface heat fluxes, but its effectiveness over ocean surfaces has not been validated. This study integrates heat storage effects and four empirical Bowen ratio formulas into the MEP theory to improve ocean LE estimation. We employed multi-source data from 129 globally distributed buoy stations and seven auxiliary turbulent flux datasets for validation and comparison. We first evaluated the MEP method using observed data from buoy stations, identifying the optimal Bowen ratio formula to enhance the model. Results indicate that accounting for heat storage and adjusting the Bowen ratio significantly improve heat flux accuracy, with R2=0.99 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.7 W·m-2 compared to observations. Subsequently, we conducted a thorough evaluation of seven global turbulent flux datasets to identify the most accurate input variables (e.g., heat storage, net radiation, surface temperature) for applying the MEP method on a global ocean scale. The enhanced MEP method provided new estimates of the annual average LE at 93 W·m-2 and sensible heat at 12 W·m-2 for the period 1988 to 2017. Validation against observations from 129 buoy stations demonstrated that the MEP-derived latent heat dataset achieved the highest accuracy, with a mean error (ME) of 1.3 W·m-2, an RMSE of 15.9 W·m-2, and a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.89, outperforming four major long-term global heat flux datasets, including J-OFURO3, ERA5, MERRA2, and OAFlux. Additionally, we examined the long-term spatiotemporal variability of global ocean evaporation, identifying a significant increasing trend from 1988 to 2010 at a rate of 3.58 mm/yr, followed by a decline at a rate of -2.18 mm/yr from 2010 to 2017. The current dataset provides a new benchmark for the ocean surface energy budget and is expected to be valuable for research on global ocean warming, sea surface-atmosphere energy exchange, the water cycle and climate change. The monthly MEP heat flux dataset for 1988–2017 is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26861767.v2 (Yang et al., 2024, last access: 28 August 2024)."

It provides valuable insights into how reservoir storage has grown by 130 % between 2008 and 2017, driven by dams in key river basins. Our data also reveal how droughts, like the 2019–2020 event, significantly impacted water reservoirs. This resource can aid water management, drought planning, and research globally. 
 The recent surge in reservoir construction has increased global surface water storage, with Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) being a significant hotspot. Such infrastructural evolution demands updates in water management strategies and hydrological models. However, information on actual reservoir storage is hard to acquire, especially for transboundary river basins. To date, no high spatio-temporal dataset on absolute storage time series is available for reservoirs in MSEA. To address this gap, we present (1) a comprehensive, open-access database of absolute storage time series (sub-monthly) for 185 reservoirs (larger than 0.1 km3) in MSEA spanning the period 1985–2023, and (2) an analysis of the reservoir storage dynamics. The MSEA-Res database includes static (Area-Elevation-Storage curves, water frequency, reservoir extent) and dynamic (area, water level, and absolute storage time series) components for each reservoir. The 185 reservoirs collectively store around 175 km³ (140 km³ – 210 km³) of water, covering an aggregated area of 8,700 km² (6,500 km² – 10,000 km²). We show that the combined average reservoir storage has increased from 70 km³ to 160 km³ (+130 %) from 2008 to 2017, primarily contributed by dams in the Irrawaddy, Red, Upper Mekong, and Lower Mekong basins. Our in-situ validation provides a good match between estimated storage and in-situ observations, with 60 % of the validation sites (12 out of 20) showing an R² > 0.65 and an average nRMSE < 15 %. The indirect validation (based on altimetry-converted storage) shows even better results, with an R² > 0.7 and an average nRMSE < 12 % for 70 % (14 out of 20) of the reservoirs. Furthermore, the analysis of the 2019–2020 drought event reveals that nearly 30–40 % of the MSEA region experienced more than five months of drought, with the most significant impact on reservoirs in Cambodia and Thailand. As a result, storage departures ranged up to -40 % in some reservoirs, highlighting significant impacts on water availability. Overall, this analysis demonstrates the potential of the inferred storage time series for assessing real-life water-related problems in Mainland Southeast Asia, with the possibility of applications in other parts of the world. The MSEA-Res database and associated Python code are publicly available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12787699 (Mahto et al., 2024)."

Moored instruments have traditionally been used to obtain long-term observations on the continental shelf. However, mooring losses or instrument failures often result in data gaps. Here we present a gap-filled time series dataset of a shelf mooring array off the Western Australian coast, by adopting a machine learning tool to fill the data gaps. The gap-filled data has acceptable errors and shows consistency with observations. 
 Coastal moorings allow scientists to collect long-term datasets valuable in understanding shelf dynamics, detecting climate variability and changes, and evaluating their impacts on marine ecosystems. Continuous time series data from moorings is often disrupted due to mooring losses or instrument failures, which prevents us from obtaining complete and accurate information on the marine environment. Here, we present an updated version of the 14-year subsurface mooring dataset off the southwest coast of Western Australia during 2010–2023 (https://doi.org/10.25919/myac-yx60, Bui and Feng, 2024). This updated dataset offers continuous daily temperature and current data with a 5-meter vertical resolution, collected from six coastal Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) moorings at depths between 48 m and 500 m. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) machine learning technique is applied to fill in the data gaps in the previous version.

Palmer,Improved definition of prior uncertainties in CO2 and CO fossil fuel fluxes and its impact on multi-species inversion with GEOS-Chem (v12.5),"Monitoring greenhouse gas emission reductions requires a combination of models and observations, as well as an initial emission estimate. Each component provides information with a certain level of certainty and is weighted to yield the most reliable estimate of actual emissions. We describe efforts for estimating the uncertainty in the initial emission estimate, which significantly impacts the outcome. Hence, a good uncertainty estimate is key for obtaining reliable information on emissions. 
 Monitoring, reporting, and verification frameworks for greenhouse gas emissions are being developed by countries across the world to keep track of progress towards national emission reduction targets. Data assimilation plays an important role in monitoring frameworks, combining different sources of information to achieve the best possible estimate of fossil fuel emissions and, as a consequence, better estimates for fluxes from the natural biosphere. Robust estimates for fossil fuel emissions rely on accurate estimates of uncertainties corresponding to different pieces of information. We describe prior uncertainties in CO2 and CO fossil fuel fluxes, paying special attention to spatial error correlations and the covariance structure between CO2 and CO. This represents the first time that prior uncertainties in CO2 and the important co-emitted trace gas CO are defined consistently, with error correlations included, which allows us to make use of the synergy between the two trace gases to better constrain CO2 fossil fuel fluxes. CO:CO2 error correlations differ by sector, depending on the diversity of sub-processes occurring within a sector, and also show a large range of values between pixels within the same sector. For example, for other stationary combustion, pixel correlation values range from 0.1 to 1.0, whereas for road transport, the correlation is mostly larger than 0.6. We illustrate the added value of our definition of prior uncertainties using closed-loop numerical experiments over mainland Europe and the UK, which isolate the influence of using error correlations between CO2 and CO and the influence of prescribing more detailed information about prior emission uncertainties. For the experiments, synthetic in situ observations are used, allowing us to validate the results against a “truth”. The “true” emissions are made by perturbing the prior emissions (from an emission inventory) according to the prescribed prior uncertainties. We find that using our realistic definition of prior uncertainties helps our data assimilation system to differentiate more easily between CO2 fluxes from biogenic and fossil fuel sources. Using improved prior emission uncertainties, we find fewer geographic regions with significant deviations from the prior compared to when using default prior uncertainties (32 vs. 80 grid cells of 0.25°×0.3125°, with an absolute difference of more than 1 kg s−1 between the prior and posterior), but these deviations from the prior almost consistently move closer to the prescribed true values, with 92 % showing an improvement, in contrast to the default prior uncertainties, where 61 % show an improvement. We also find that using CO provides additional information on CO2 fossil fuel fluxes, but this is only the case if the CO:CO2 error covariance structure is defined realistically. Using the default prior uncertainties, the CO2 fossil fuel fluxes move farther away from the truth in many geographical regions (with 50 % showing an improvement compared to 94 % when advanced prior uncertainties are used). With the default uncertainties, the maximum deviation of fossil fuel CO2 from the prescribed truth is about 7 % in both the prior and posterior results. With the advanced uncertainties, this is reduced to 3 % in the posterior results."

 The community Noah with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP) land surface model (LSM) that is widely used in studies from uncoupled land surface hydrometeorology and ecohydrology to coupled weather and climate predictions. In this study, we developed NMP-Hydro, a hydrological model written in CSharp(C#). NMP-Hydro was developed by faithfully translating the FORTRAN version Noah-MP from the uncoupled WRF-Hydro 3.0, and was coupled with a river routing model. NMP-Hydro exhibits the capacity of parallel execution on Windows systems, utilizing the multi-core CPUs commonly available in today's personal computers. The code of NMP-Hydro has been rigorously tested to ensure that it produces a high-degree of consistency with the simulation output of the original WRF-Hydro. High-resolution (6 km) simulations were conducted and assessed over a grid domain covering the entire Yellow River Basin and the most part of North China. The spatial maps and temporal variations of many state variables simulated by NMP-Hydro and WRF-Hydro/Noah-MP demonstrate consistent results, with occasionally minor discrepancies. The river discharge for the Yellow River under various scheme combinations of six Noah-MP parameterizations exhibits general close agreement with the natural river discharge at the Lanzhou station. NMP-Hydro can be regarded as a reliable replica of Noah-MP in WRF-Hydro 3.0, but it can leverage the modern, powerful, and user-friendly features brought by the C # language to significantly improve the efficiency of the model users and developers."

In this work, we extended the application of FLPs on CeO2(110) to the selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 (NH3–SCR), finding a notable enhancement in performance compared to ordinary CeO2(110). Additionally, an innovative approach involving H2 treatment was discovered to increase the number of FLPs, thereby further boosting the NH3–SCR efficiency. Typically, NH3–SCR on regular CeO2 follows the Eley–Rideal (E–R) mechanism. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a significant reduction in the energy barriers for the activation of N–O and N–H bonds under the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) mechanism with FLPs present. This transition shifted the reaction mechanism from the E–R pathway on regular R-CeO2 to the L-H pathway on FLP-rich FR-CeO2, as corroborated by the experimental findings. The practical application of FLPs was realized by loading MoO3 onto FLP-rich FR-CeO2, leveraging the synergistic effects of acidic sites and FLPs. This study provides profound insights into how FLPs facilitate N–H/N–O bond activation in small molecules, such as NH3 and NO, offering a new paradigm for catalyst design based on catalytic mechanism research."

A total of 369 intermittent bleed and 26 continuous low-bleed pneumatic devices were measured using a high-volume sampler. Considering all intermittent bleed devices, the emission factor from this study was statistically lower than the factor in the revised Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule (GHGRP) issued May 6, 2024. Intermittent devices were classified by inspection with an optical gas imaging camera as functioning or malfunctioning. Measurements of functioning intermittent bleed devices were statistically higher while measurements of malfunctioning intermittent bleed devices were statistically lower than the corresponding emission factor in the final revisions to the GHGRP. Measurements of continuous low-bleed pneumatic devices were statistically lower than the updated factor in the final revisions to GHGRP. Additionally, a Monte Carlo analysis was conducted to investigate the potential impact of measurement duration and sample size on emission factors derived for intermittent bleed devices. We conclude that while a short measurement duration may miss actuations of properly operating devices with low vent frequencies, potentially resulting in an emission factor with low bias, the sample size of greater than 300 measurements each greater than 3 min in duration, as included in this study, is unlikely to be biased low in a statistically significant manner, particularly when one considers the material contribution of malfunctioning devices."

Specifically, sample solutions containing NaCl, NaBr, NH4Cl, and NaI at concentrations between 10–6 and 10–1 M were subjected to freezing–melting cycles and then analyzed for H2O2 content. The relationship between the production rate of H2O2 and the salt concentration follows that of the Workman–Reynolds freezing potential (WRFP) values as a function of the salt concentration. Our results suggest that H2O2 is formed at the liquid–ice interface from the self-recombination of hydroxyl radicals (OH·), produced from the oxidation of hydroxide anions due to the high electric field generated at the aqueous–ice interface under the WRFP effect. Furthermore, the involvement of O2 likely acting as an electron capturer could promote to produce more OH radicals and  hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2·), thus enhancing the production of H2O2 at the liquid–ice interface. Overall, this study suggests a novel mechanism of H2O2 formation in ice via its spontaneous production at the liquid–ice interface, induced by the Workman–Reynolds effect."

The recent US federal infrastructure funding, coupled with research efforts to explore innovative, alternative decentralized wastewater systems, are unprecedented opportunities for addressing basic sanitation gaps in these communities. Yet, understanding how to best manage these systems for sustainable operations and maintenance (O&M) is still a national need. Here, we develop an integrated management approach for achieving such sustainable systems, taking into account the utility structure, operational aspects, and possible barriers impeding effective management of decentralized wastewater infrastructure. We demonstrate this approach through a binomial logistic regression of survey responses from 114 public and private management entities (e.g., water and sewer utilities) operating in 27 states in the US, targeting the rural Alabama Black Belt wastewater issues. Our assessment introduces policy areas that support sustainable decentralized wastewater systems management and operations, including privatizing water-wastewater infrastructure systems, incentivizing/mandating the consolidation of utility management of these systems, federally funding the O&M, and developing and retaining water-wastewater workforce in rural, underserved communities.

Recently, the role of miRNAs in the response of aquatic organisms to environmental stressors has emerged. Daphnia, widely distributed cladocerans, play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems. Cyanobacterial blooms often cause Daphnia populations to decrease, thereby disrupting ecosystem functionality and water quality. However, the post-transcriptional mechanisms behind Daphnia’s response to toxic cyanobacteria are insufficiently understood. This study investigated the role of miR-210, a multifunctional miRNA involved in stress response and toxicity pathways, and its target genes (MLH3, CDHR5, and HYOU1) in two Daphnia magna clones exposed to toxic Microcystis aeruginosa. Results showed that M. aeruginosa inhibited somatic growth rates, led to microcystin accumulation, caused abnormal ultrastructural alterations in the digestive tract, and induced DNA damage in both clones. Notably, exposure significantly increased miR-210 expression and decreased the expression of its target genes compared with the controls. We identified miR-210s regulation on clonal-tolerance variations in D. magna to M. aeruginosa, emphasizing miRNAs’ contribution to adaptive responses.

However, the spine was more sensitive to the Cu exposure. In the spine region, the Cu(I) level remained stable, whereas the level of Cu(II) significantly increased, which was highly associated with spine development injury.

Cl2•– represents one of the extensively generated radicals in AOPs, whose behavior in DBP formation remains unknown. In this study, we found that aromatic structures serve as the main DBP precursors in Cl2•– reactions by employing diverse groups of model compounds. At a typical Cl2•– exposure of 1.2 × 10–9 M·s, the sum concentrations of 7 regulated aliphatic DBPs (e.g., trichloromethane, chloroacetic acids) are ∼0.10 to 0.48 μM for aromatic precursors and <0.05 μM for aliphatic ones. The DBP formation mechanisms from Cl2•– reactions involved the formation of chlorinated aromatics, radical-induced oxygen incorporation followed by ring cleavage, and the interactions of Cl2•– with ring-cleavage intermediates. In reacting with DOM, Cl2•– reactions produced much fewer aliphatic DBPs (5% of the total organochlorine vs 40% for chlorination) and chloroacetic acids dominated the aliphatic DBPs (usually trihalomethane for chlorination), which can be well interpreted by the precursors and mechanisms proposed.

Here we present the first data set on Zn isotopes in glacial cryoconite, based on observations over a large regional scale in High Asian Mountains (including Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surroundings of western China). The results showed that glacial cryoconite had a general heavy Zn isotopic signature in various TP locations, with δ66Zn values ranging from −0.22‰ to +0.87‰. Employing the MixSIAR model, the overall Zn contribution source to the cryoconite was mineral dust (36%) > coal burning (33%) > non‐exhaust traffic emissions (22%) > industrial smelting (10%). We ascertained that anthropogenic sources account for the primary contribution (about 60%–73%) of Zn inputs in all glacial locations, with coal burning emerging as the foremost anthropogenic contributor (mean 33%). Anthropogenic Zn in various TP locations was primarily derived from Zn emissions resulting from coal combustion, though it is also predominantly influenced by industrial smelting source in cryoconite of the Tianshan Mountains.

Here, we present a comprehensive assessment using the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) of the global rates and long‐term trends (1982–2019) of wind erosion using a spatially explicit (0.05° × 0.05°) quantitative model. On average, in this study global wind erosion caused 312.5 Pg yr−1 of soil loss, with a decreasing trend of 1.04 ± 0.48 Pg yr−1 (p < 0.05) during 1982–2019. Excluding stable regions, approximately 36% of the modeled areas exhibit a significant decrease in wind erosion, accounting for 3.13 ± 0.18 Pg yr−1, while only 9% experience a notable increase, amounting for 1.83 ± 0.16 Pg yr−1. The decrease of wind erosion primarily occurs in the southern hemispheres. Notably, wind erosion decreases considerably in grassland and cropland, while it remains unchanged in dryland. Although grassland and cropland account for only 11% and 1.8% of the total erosion, they contribute to 68% and 17% of the total erosion reduction, respectively. This study highlights global wind stilling and vegetation greening as important factors contributing to the decline in wind erosion and offers valuable insights into the intricate relationship between climate change and terrestrial ecosystems, including carbon sequestration and agricultural productivity."

Mirchi,Customized Statistically Downscaled CMIP5 and CMIP6 Projections: Application in the Edwards Aquifer Region in South‐Central Texas,"Climate projections are being used for decision‐making related to climate mitigation and adaptation and as inputs for impacts modeling related to climate change. The plethora of available projections presents end users with the challenge of how to select climate projections, known as the “practitioner's dilemma.” In addition, if an end‐user determines that existing projections cannot be used, then they face the additional challenge of producing climate projections for their region that are useful for their needs. We present a methodology with novel features to address the “practitioner's dilemma” for generating downscaled climate projections for specific applications. We use the Edwards Aquifer region (EAR) in south‐central Texas to demonstrate a process to select a subset of global climate models from both the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles, followed by downscaling and verification of the accuracy of downscaled data against historical data. The results show that average precipitation changes range from a decrease of 10.4 mm to an increase of 25.6 mm, average temperature increases from 2.0°C to 4.3°C, and the number of days exceeding 37.8°C (100°F) increase by 35–70 days annually by the end of century. The findings enhance our understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on the EAR, essential for developing effective regional management strategies. Additionally, the results provide valuable scenario‐based projected data to be used for groundwater and spring flow modeling and present a clearly documented example addressing the “practitioner's dilemma” in the EAR."

Although cropland expansion may overconsume local water resources in general, in Northwest China, increased precipitation and enhanced glacier melt have increased the water available for croplands. Counterintuitively, the enhanced evapotranspiration (ET) resulting from this cropland expansion could benefit remote ecologically vulnerable natural vegetation through atmospheric moisture recycling. In this study, we used a moisture tracking model to quantify contributions of croplands and cropland expansion to local precipitation and the consequent precipitation supply to natural vegetation in Northwest China. We found that the croplands contributed 27.69 billion m3/year (2.13%) of regional total precipitation and supplied 17.30 billion m3/year (2.39%) of precipitation over natural vegetation, and the cropland expansion resulted in a net increase of 80.25 million m3/year (1.07% of the total increase) in regional precipitation and 36.23 million m3/year (4.56% of the total increase) in precipitation supply for natural vegetation. Among different types of natural vegetation, grasslands received the most precipitation supply due to its vast area, followed by forests and shrublands. The more arid regions experienced not only faster rates of cropland expansion but also obtained a greater increase in regional precipitation and precipitation supply to natural vegetation. Our study quantifies the ecological impacts of cropland expansion through moisture recycling in Northwest China. This shows the complexities of water competition between agricultural development and ecological conservation in drylands and elsewhere."

 Characterizing multipartite quantum systems is crucial for quantum computing and many-body physics. The problem, however, becomes challenging when the system size is large and the properties of interest involve correlations among a large number of particles. Here we introduce a neural network model that can predict various quantum properties of many-body quantum states with constant correlation length, using only measurement data from a small number of neighboring sites. The model is based on the technique of multi-task learning, which we show to offer several advantages over traditional single-task approaches. Through numerical experiments, we show that multi-task learning can be applied to sufficiently regular states to predict global properties, like string order parameters, from the observation of short-range correlations, and to distinguish between quantum phases that cannot be distinguished by single-task networks. Remarkably, our model appears to be able to transfer information learnt from lower dimensional quantum systems to higher dimensional ones, and to make accurate predictions for Hamiltonians that were not seen in the training. Inferring quantum properties of many-body systems is both essential and challenging. Here the authors develop a neural network model that infers these properties from short-range measurements using a quantum-adapted multi-task learning approach."

 River deltas offer numerous ecosystem services and host an estimated global population of 350 million to more than 500 million inhabitants in over 100 countries. To maintain their sustainability into the future, deltas need to withstand sea-level rise from global warming, but human pressures and diminishing sediment supplies are exacerbating their vulnerability.

 Typhoons are one of the most important weather systems that can cause severe ozone (O3) pollution in eastern China. While the effects of individual typhoons on O3 concentrations have been extensively studied, the effects of consecutive northward typhoons and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, partly due to the complex processes involved. Here, Typhoons Maysak and Haishen, two consecutive northward typhoons in 2020, are selected to investigate their impact on the O3 pollution in eastern China. The results show that consecutive northward typhoons not only produced and maintained meteorological conditions conducive to O3 generation (e.g., elevated temperatures and intensified solar radiation), but also facilitated local accumulation and cross-regional transport of O3. These factors jointly led to a 30% increase in O3 concentration in eastern China with a prolonged period of O3 pollution. Our work underscores the significance of complex meteorological conditions in O3 pollution occurrences during extreme weather events, advancing our understanding of how consecutive northward typhoons affect air quality."

Using reanalysis product and Earth System Model data, the spatiotemporal characteristics and temperature sensitivities of EPEs are analyzed. Results show that EPE-Hs, while less frequent, have longer duration and greater magnitude compared to EPE-NHs, particularly in high latitude regions. In the future, a significant increase is projected in the characteristics of EPE-Hs, in contrast to the stable duration and magnitude of EPE-NHs. EPE-Hs demonstrate substantially higher temperature sensitivity than EPE-NHs, especially in low latitudes. The precipitation-temperature scaling relationships diverge markedly between EPE-Hs and EPE-NHs, with notable regional variations.

 Insights into the impacts of freeze-thaw processes on soil microorganisms and their related functions in permafrost regions are crucial for assessing ecological consequences imposed by the shifts in freeze-thaw patterns. Through in-situ investigations on seasonal freeze-thaw processes in the active layer of permafrost in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we found that microbial richness was higher and positively correlated with soil multifunctionality during the freeze-thaw stage (freezing and thawing periods) compared to the non-freeze-thaw stage (completely frozen and thawed periods). This relationship resulted from the higher microbial stability, which was highly consistent with the lower complexity, more keystone taxa, and greater robustness of networks. Although freeze-thaw strength exacerbated the greenhouse effect on climate, it was alleviated by the enhancement of diversity-soil multifunctionality relationship. These findings have substantial implications for exploring the responses of microbial-mediated soil multifunctionality and greenhouse effect in alpine permafrost to more drastic variations of freeze-thaw processes under future warming.

 Forest regeneration is a crucial strategy for mitigating and adapting to global warming. Yet its precise impact on local climate remains uncertain, a factor that complicates decision-making when it comes to prioritizing investments. Here, we developed global maps illustrating how natural forest regeneration influences key local climate drivers—land surface temperature (LST), albedo, and evapotranspiration—using models fitted at a 1-km spatial resolution with a random forest classifier. We found that natural forest regeneration can alter annual mean LST by 0.01 °C, −0.59 °C, −0.50 °C, and −2.03 °C in Boreal, Mediterranean, Temperate, and Tropical regions, respectively. These variations underscore the region-specific effects of forest regeneration. Importantly, natural forest regeneration reduces LST across 64% of 1 billion hectares and 75% of 148 million hectares of potentially restorable land under different scenarios. These findings improve understanding of how forest regeneration can help regulate local climate, supporting climate adaptation efforts. Natural forest regeneration can enhance local climate adaptation by reducing land surface temperature.

We used records of pollen, coprophilous fungal spores, and charcoal from a well-dated, high-resolution lake sediment core from the Southern Tibetan Plateau (STP) to investigate the history of high-altitude survival strategies, including arable agriculture and pastoralism, spanning the past 3600 years. The results revealed that survival strategies were dominated by arable agriculture, supplemented by pastoralism, from ~3600 to 1800 cal yr BP. However, after 1800 cal yr BP, this strategy shifted to low-level arable agriculture with intensified pastoralism. Comparison of our findings with regional paleoclimatic and archaeological records revealed that this transformation was an adaptive response to drought intensification. This adaptive resilience was a key aspect of human occupation of the high-altitude regions of the TP during the late Holocene. A high-resolution multiproxy lake record from southern Tibetan Plateau reveals major subsistence strategy changes and the onset of modern pastoral ecology under accelerated climatic drying about 1800 years ago."

 Climate change has intensified flooding in arid and semi-arid regions, presenting a major challenge for flood monitoring and mapping. While satellites, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), allow synoptically observing flood extents, accurately differentiating between sandy terrains and water for arid region flooding remains an open challenge. Current global flood mapping products exclude arid areas from their analyses due to the sand and water confusion, resulting in a critical lack of observations which impedes response and recovery in these vulnerable regions. This paper explores the full potential of Sentinel-1 SAR to improve near-real-time flood mapping in arid and semi-arid regions. By investigating the impact of various parameters such as polarization, temporal information, and interferometric coherence, the most important information sources for detecting arid floods were identified. Using three distinct arid flood events in Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan, different scenarios were constructed and tested using RF to evaluate the effectiveness of each feature. Permutation feature importance analysis was additionally conducted to identify key elements that reduce computational costs and enable a faster response during emergencies. Fusing VV coherence and amplitude information in pre-flood and post-flood imagery proved to be the most suitable approach. Results also show that leveraging crucial features reduces computational time by ∼35% as well as improves flood mapping accuracy by ∼50%. With advancements in cloud processing capabilities, the computational challenges associated with interferometric SAR computations are no longer a barrier. The demonstrated adaptability of the proposed approach across different arid areas, offers a step forward towards improved global flood mapping."

 Improving our understanding of the energy and water exchanges between the land surface and the lower atmosphere (i.e. land–atmosphere interactions), and how climate change may affect them, is crucial to predict changes in temperature and precipitation extremes. Observations of energy and water fluxes at the land surface are typically retrieved from the eddy covariance method, which presents limitations related to spatial and temporal gaps, and the non-closure of the energy and water balances. Meanwhile, soil moisture (SM) products derived from satellite data have been widely used at regional and global scales, but they are limited to capture only surface soil water content and variations. The combination of remote sensing (RS) data and modelling frameworks is called to be the solution to improve the spatial coverage and vertical resolution of land–atmosphere interactions data, ensuring the energy and water balance closure. Here, we explore the combination of remote sensing and meteorological data with a physical-based modelling framework, the High resOlution Land Atmosphere Parameters from Space (HOLAPS). We used HOLAPS to produce hourly consistent estimates of energy and water fluxes over Europe at 5 km resolution. HOLAPS and other satellite-based evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux products from the literature are evaluated against the water balance method and eddy covariance measurements. HOLAPS SM estimates together with other RS-modelling products are also evaluated against ground-based measurements at the surface and in the root zone. The evaluation of HOLAPS ET estimates show similar performance to the other products with Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) ¿ -0.41 in comparison with eddy covariance measurements from FLUXNET in all seasons but in boreal winter. The simulation of H is more uncertain than for ET with KGE values ranging from -2.5 to 0.8 along the products and stations at monthly scales. HOLAPS reaches slightly better results than the rest of ET and H products at daily scales in summer (KGE ¿ 0.3 for ET and KGE ¿ 0.0 for H) and during hot conditions (KGE ¿ 0.2 for ET and KGE ¿-0.2 for H), while the state-of-the-art products show KGE ¿ 0.1 for ET and KGE ¿ -0.41 for H in summer and KGE ¿ -0.1 for ET and KGE ¿ -0.6 for H during hot conditions. All products evaluated here yield a reasonable performance (KGE ¿-0.41 at most sites) in simulating SM at the surface and in the root zone. Our results expose the need for further investigating and improving product performances during extreme conditions. The good performance of HOLAPS together with its inherent advantages (RS data driven, high temporal and spatial resolution, spatial and temporal continuity, soil moisture at different depths and long-term consistent evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux estimates) support its use for agricultural and forest management activities as well as to study land–atmosphere interactions based on Earth Observations."

 Emissions from industrial parks are crucial sources of ambient volatile organic compound (VOC) pollution, characterized by high concentrations, complex compositions, dispersed emission sources, and uneven spatial distribution. To better understand and address this issue, it is crucial to analyze the spatial differences in VOC pollution and associated health risks through multi-point monitoring. In this study, we established four online monitoring sites in a typical industrial park in Kaifeng, China. We monitored 115 VOC species and found significant differences in the concentration and chemical composition of total VOCs (TVOCs) among the four sites. Two sites were primarily composed of halohydrocarbons (49.80% and 41.21%), while the other two sites had a higher proportion of aromatics (54.78% and 39.03%). Acetaldehyde was the main contributor to ozone formation potential (OFP) at one site, while toluene was associated with the other three sites. The site with the highest VOC concentration and OFP also showed the highest secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP). In terms of health risk assessment, acrolein posed a non-carcinogenic risk at all sites, but there were disparities in the carcinogenic risk among the four sites. 1,2-Dichloroethane at one site exceeded the definite risk limit, while 1,2-dibromoethane and chloroform were considered probable risk species at another site. Considering both the environmental impact and health risk, we used entropy-weighting to calculate a comprehensive control index (CCI). This index identified 1,2-dichloroethane as the Level Ⅰ controlled pollutant species at two sites, and toluene at the other two sites. This study highlights the spatial heterogeneity in VOC pollution and health risks within the industrial park, providing valuable insights for targeted pollution control strategies."

 Pollutants emitted by catering enterprises pose a significant threat to the environment and public health. In this study, based on a systematic analysis of volatile organic compound (VOC) emission characteristics of different cuisines, the contribution of cooking emissions from catering enterprises to the PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the atmosphere was evaluated using generation potential calculations and WRF-CAMx simulations. The health exposure risks of VOCs in kitchen breathing areas and those of PM2.5 and O3 contributed by the catering enterprises were evaluated. The generation potential calculation results showed that the catering enterprises exhibit 2.21–5.00 gO3/gVOCs of ozone formation potential (OFP) and 0.07–0.21 gSOA/gVOCs of secondary organic aerosol production potential (SOAP). The WRF-CAMx simulation results indicated that cooking emissions from catering enterprises contribute 0.36–1.91 μg/m3 and 0.05–0.21 μg/m3 to PM2.5 and maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) concentrations of O3. The health exposure risks of PM2.5 and O3 were higher in catering enterprises in southern cities than in northern cities and were higher in urban areas than in suburban areas. The average hazardous VOCs (HVOCs) concentrations ranged from 53 ± 16 to 357 ± 31 μg/m3 in kitchen breathing areas. Acrolein was the primary contributor to the hazard index (HI) of all VOC species, accounting for 50.9%–99.5%. The total incremental lifetime carcinogenic risk (ILCR) of all cuisines exceeded the acceptable thresholds of 1.00 × 10−6.

 Gaseous and PM10 samples were collected during the open burning of pruning residues (olive branches and garden waste) and characterised by distinct analytical techniques to obtain comprehensive chemical emission profiles. Oxidative potential (dithiothreoitol and ascorbic acid assays) and cell viability tests were also performed with the aim of evaluating aerosol toxicity. Emission factors (EFs) were as follows (g kg−1 biofuel, dry basis): 1537–1672 for CO2, 41.9–80 for CO, 2.74–6.6 for CH4, 0.89–3.51 for ethane, 0.79–1.78 for ethylene and 0.56–3.47 for formaldehyde. Emissions of PM10, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were in the ranges 8–41, 3–18, and 0.4–1.5 g kg−1 biofuel, dry basis, respectively. OC accounted for 35–45% of the total PM10 mass, while EC contributed between around 3% and 5%. WSOC/OC ratios varied from 0.4 to 0.6, revealing that a substantial portion of the carbon emitted was hydrosoluble. Water soluble ions constituted around 8–21% of the PM10 mass, with potassium and chloride as the most abundant ions in all samples. Levoglucosan, widely used a reliable biomass burning tracer, was found in significant amounts in all samples (up to 1.2% of the PM10 mass). Retene, generally pointed out as a biomass combustion biomarker, was the predominant PAH. WSOC and some PAHs showed significant positive correlations with the intrinsic OP measured with the DTT assay, while the OPAA was significantly correlated with some trace metals, such as Fe or Ni.

 Based on data diagnosis and numerical experiments, this study investigated the changes in the interannual properties of the May North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and their impact on summer (June–July) sea ice in the North Atlantic during 1979–2021. Results showed statistically significant increase in the interannual variability of the May NAO after the mid-2000s, which had remarkably enhanced impact on summer sea ice in the eastern Hudson Bay (EHB) and the western Labrador Sea (WLS). During 2005–2021, corresponding to a positive phase of the May NAO, anomalous surface westerly or northwesterly winds prevailed over the Hudson Bay and Labrador Sea in May. This led to statistically significant increase in sea ice in both the EHB and the WLS in May via dynamic processes (favoring southeastward movement of the sea ice) and thermal processes (changing surface turbulent heating and shortwave radiation). In comparison with the situation in May, the increase in sea ice in the EHB developed further during summer mainly via thermal processes (positive feedback between the increased sea ice and shortwave radiation). In contrast, amplitude of the increased sea ice in the WLS was comparable between May and summer. Dynamic processes (southeastward movement of sea ice), which was induced by a barotropic anomalous high in the troposphere centered over the Labrador Peninsula, favored the increase in sea ice in summer in the WLS. The tripole sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic and increased snowpack on the Labrador Peninsula in May, triggered by the positive phase of the May NAO, played an important role in the formation of the anomalous high. During 1979–2004, the surface wind, snowpack, and tripole sea surface temperature anomalies in May, triggered by the May NAO, were relatively weak, leading to statistically insignificant changes in summer sea ice in the EHB and WLS."

We generated morphomaps of preimplantation embryogenesis in mouse, rabbit, and monkey embryos, and these morphomaps revealed that although blastomere divisions desynchronized passively, 8-cell embryos converged toward robust three-dimensional shapes. Using topological analysis and genetic perturbations, we found that embryos progressively changed their cellular connectivity to a preferred topology, which could be predicted by a physical model in which actomyosin contractility and noise facilitate topological transitions, lowering surface energy. This mechanism favored regular embryo packing and promoted a higher number of inner cells in the 16-cell embryo. Synchronized division reduced embryo packing and generated substantially more misallocated cells and fewer inner-cell–mass cells. These findings suggest that stochasticity in division timing contributes to robust patterning."

We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase pathway.

We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains."

Andrew Chess",Somatic mosaicism in schizophrenia brains reveals prenatal mutational processes,"Germline mutations modulate the risk of developing schizophrenia (SCZ). Much less is known about the role of mosaic somatic mutations in the context of SCZ. Deep (239×) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of brain neurons from 61 SCZ cases and 25 controls postmortem identified mutations occurring during prenatal neurogenesis. SCZ cases showed increased somatic variants in open chromatin, with increased mosaic CpG transversions (CpG>GpG) and T>G mutations at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) overlapping open chromatin, a result not seen in controls. Some of these variants alter gene expression, including SCZ risk genes and genes involved in neurodevelopment. Although these mutational processes can reflect a difference in factors indirectly involved in disease, increased somatic mutations at developmental TFBSs could also potentially contribute to SCZ."

Schroeder,Ecological speciation in Darwin’s finches: Ghosts of finches future,"The theory of ecological speciation posits that adaptive divergence among incipient species raises incidental barriers to reproduction, thus catalyzing the emergence of new species. In this study, we conducted an experimental test of this theory in Galápagos finches, a clade in which beaks and mating songs are mechanistically linked. We forecasted the acoustic structure of songs for a set of possible evolutionary futures (successive droughts spurring increasingly large beaks) and, in a field assay, presented resulting song simulations to territorial males. We found that responses to songs dropped off after six simulated drought events, to degrees roughly comparable to drops in response to songs that diverged through cultural drift and acoustic adaptation. Our results support, in Darwin’s finches, the feasibility and mechanistic bases of an ecological speciation hypothesis."

Weyhenmeyer;Xiao Yang,Environmental and societal consequences of winter ice loss from lakes,"Climate change is reducing winter ice cover on lakes; yet, the full societal and environmental consequences of this ice loss are poorly understood. The socioeconomic implications of declining ice include diminished access to ice-based cultural activities, safety concerns in traversing ice, changes in fisheries, increases in shoreline erosion, and declines in water storage. Longer ice-free seasons allow more time and capacity for water to warm, threatening water quality and biodiversity. Food webs likely will reorganize, with constrained availability of ice-associated and cold-water niches, and ice loss will affect the nature, magnitude, and timing of greenhouse gas emissions. Examining these rapidly emerging changes will generate more-complete models of lake dynamics, and transdisciplinary collaborations will facilitate translation to effective management and sustainability."
