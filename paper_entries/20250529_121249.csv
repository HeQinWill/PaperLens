10.5194/acp-25-5355-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文通过对上海市PM2.5中碳气溶胶的长期测量和分析，评估了中国清洁空气行动对有机气溶胶的影响。重点关注了初级有机碳（POC）和次级有机碳（SOC）的时空变化、来源和形成机制。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其对大气成分（特别是碳气溶胶）的监测和分析，与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面的应用密切相关。该研究的结果可以用于验证和改进基于遥感数据的空气质量模型，并为制定更有效的空气污染控制策略提供科学依据。,"['organic aerosols', 'carbonaceous aerosols', 'PM2.5', 'primary organic carbon (POC)', 'secondary organic carbon (SOC)', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Haifeng Yu;Yunhua Chang;Lin Cheng;Yusen Duan;Jianlin Hu,Measurement report: Long-term assessment of primary and secondary organic aerosols in the Shanghai megacity throughout China's Clean Air actions since 2010,"This study presents long-term measurements and comprehensive analysis of carbonaceous aerosols in fine particles in Shanghai. We further estimated primary and secondary carbon levels, examining their temporal variations on interannual, monthly, seasonal, and diurnal scales. Through rigorous statistical analysis and correlation studies with meteorological parameters and pollutant concentrations, the origins, formation mechanisms, and spatial distribution patterns of secondary organic carbon were elucidated. 
 A growing body of research has demonstrated the effectiveness of China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in controlling PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm), pollution. However, there is a lack of long-term studies investigating the impact of these abatement policies on carbonaceous aerosols in PM2.5, particularly secondary organic carbon (SOC). Shanghai, as China's largest megacity and a prominent industrial hub, serves as a crucial gateway to the nation's rapid development, with a population exceeding 20 million. In this study, we conducted hourly online measurements of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) in PM2.5 in Shanghai from July 2010 to July 2017. The results revealed that the annual concentrations (mean ± 1σ) of OC and EC reached their peaks in 2013 (9.5 ± 6.4 and 2.7 ± 2.6 to 3.0 ± 2.3 and 2.7 ± 2.1 µg m−3). Subsequently, a consistent year-to-year decrease in both OC and EC concentrations was observed, mirroring the trend observed for PM2.5. Primary organic carbon (POC), the primary component of OC, accounted for an average of 65.6 %, displaying similar trends to OC. This finding indicates the effectiveness of primary emission control measures. However, the concentration of secondary organic carbon (SOC) did not decrease from 2013 to 2017, remaining relatively stable within the range of 2.7 ± 2.6 to 3.0 ± 2.3 µg m−3. When considering data from previous studies in Shanghai, concentrations of SOC did not exhibit a noticeable decline until 2018, coinciding with the implementation of measures targeting volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Seasonally, with the exception of 2011, OC and EC concentrations were highest during winter, likely influenced by unfavorable meteorological conditions and long-range transport. SOC displayed no distinct seasonal fluctuations, as its formation is influenced by both photochemical reactions and meteorological conditions. POC and SOC exhibited different diurnal patterns, but neither showed a significant weekend effect, suggesting limited reduction in anthropogenic activities during weekends. Furthermore, SOC concentrations exhibited simultaneous increases in summer, particularly when O3 concentrations exceeded 50 µg m−3, indicating that stronger oxidation reactions contribute to higher SOC concentrations. Our findings also revealed concentration gradients of SOC dependent on wind direction (WD) and wind speed (WS), with higher concentrations typically observed for winds originating from the southwest and northwest. Potential sources from distant regions were analyzed using the potential source contribution function (PSCF), indicating that the geographical potential source area is concentrated near the middle and lower Yangtze River."
10.5194/acp-25-5331-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了如何追踪极地地区大气中短寿命物质的来源，重点关注气溶胶粒子和痕量气体。论文评估了传统的后向模拟方法在识别这些物质来源方面的准确性，并提出了一种改进的分析方法。通过结合FLEXPART模型和WRF-Chem模型，研究发现传统方法常常误判排放源区域。改进后的方法在识别甲烷磺酸和黑碳等物质的来源方面表现出更好的性能。虽然论文没有直接涉及卫星观测或特定的遥感技术，但它与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关，因为准确识别大气污染物的来源对于理解和改善空气质量至关重要。该研究的结果可以间接应用于利用遥感数据进行大气成分反演和源解析的研究。,"['aerosol particles', 'trace gases', 'backward modeling', 'source identification', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring (indirectly)', 'methane sulfonic acid', 'black carbon']",Anderson Da Silva;Louis Marelle;Jean-Christophe Raut;Yvette Gramlich;Karolina Siegel;Sophie L. Haslett;Claudia Mohr;Jennie L. Thomas,How to trace the origins of short-lived atmospheric species: an Arctic example,"Particle sources in polar climates are unclear, affecting climate representation in models. This study introduces an evaluated method for tracking particles with backward modeling. Tests on simulated particles allowed us to show that traditional detection methods often misidentify sources. An improved method that accurately traces the origins of aerosol particles in the Arctic is presented. The study recommends using this enhanced method for better source identification of atmospheric species. 
 The origins of particles and trace gases involved in the rapidly changing polar climates remain unclear, limiting the reliability of climate models. This is especially true for particles involved in aerosol–cloud interactions with polar clouds. As detailed chemical fingerprinting measurements are difficult and expensive in polar regions, backward modeling is often used to identify the sources of observed atmospheric compounds. However, the accuracy of these methods is not well quantified. This study provides an evaluation of these analysis protocols by combining backward trajectories from the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART) with simulations of tracers from the Weather Research and Forecast model including Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Knowing the exact modeled tracer emission sources in WRF-Chem enables a precise quantification of the source detection accuracy. The results show that direct interpretation of backward model outputs or more advanced analyses like potential source contribution functions (PSCFs) are often unreliable in identifying emission sources. After exploring parameter sensitivities thanks to our simulation framework, we present an updated and rigorously evaluated backward-modeling analysis protocol for tracing the origins of atmospheric species from measurement data. Two tests of the improved protocol on actual aerosol data from Arctic campaigns demonstrate its ability to correctly identify known sources of methane sulfonic acid and black carbon. Our results reveal that traditional back-trajectory methods often misidentify emission source regions. Therefore, we recommend using the method described in this study for future efforts to trace the origins of measured atmospheric species."

In 2021, our follow-up campaign using airborne remote sensing showed a marked decreases in emissions by 20 %–60 % due to improved infrastructure. The study highlights the importance of measurement-based emission monitoring and illustrates the value of a multi-scale assessment integrating ground-based observations with large-scale airborne remote sensing campaigns. 
 Reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas production infrastructure is a cost-effective way for limiting global warming. In 2019, a measurement campaign in southern Romania found emission rates from the oil and gas sector substantially higher than the nationally reported emissions, with a few high-emitting sources (“super-emitters”) contributing disproportionately to total emissions. In 2021, our follow-up airborne remote sensing campaign, covering over 80 % of production sites, revealed a marked decrease in super-emitters. The observed change in the number of emitters is consistent with an emission reduction by 20 %–60 % from 2019 to 2021. This reduction is likely due to improvements in production infrastructure following the first campaign in 2019. This is further supported by additional site visits, which showed that many of the leaks identified in 2019 had indeed been mitigated. However, our top-down quantification remains higher than the bottom-up emission reports. Our study highlights the importance of measurement-based emission monitoring of climate change mitigation measures and illustrates the value of a multi-scale assessment integrating ground-based observations with large-scale airborne mapping to capture both the primary mode of emission sources and the rare, but significant, super-emitters."
10.5194/amt-18-2295-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该论文主要研究星载雷达对地表反射信号（杂波）的特性，特别是在存在地形起伏的情况下。研究背景是欧空局的WIVERN任务，该任务旨在利用星载W波段多普勒雷达观测云内风。论文通过模拟意大利皮埃蒙特地区的扫描，分析了地表杂波对速度观测的影响。虽然主要目标是研究雷达信号和地表特性，但由于WIVERN任务与云内风观测有关，而云是大气环境的重要组成部分，并且提到了EarthCARE、CloudSat和GPM等卫星任务，这些任务都与大气观测有关，因此可以认为该论文与大气环境遥感技术有一定关联，尤其是在卫星观测和大气成分（云）分析方面。,"['Spaceborne radar', 'Doppler radar', 'W-band radar', 'Conical scanning', 'Ground clutter', 'Orography', 'Wind velocity', 'In-cloud winds', 'Satellite observations', 'EarthCARE', 'CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR)', 'Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)']",Francesco Manconi;Alessandro Battaglia;Pavlos Kollias,Characterization of surface clutter signal in the presence of orography for a spaceborne conically scanning W-band Doppler radar,"The paper aims to study the ground reflection, or clutter, of the signal from a spaceborne radar in the context of ESA's WIVERN (WInd VElocity Radar Nephoscop) mission, which will observe in-cloud winds. Using topography and land type data, with a model of the satellite orbit and rotating antenna, simulations of scans have been run over the Piedmont region of Italy. These measurements cover the full range of the ground clutter over land for WIVERN and have allowed for analyses of the precision and accuracy of velocity observations. 
 The Earth's surface radar reflection is one of the most important signals received by spaceborne radar systems. It is used in several scientific applications, including geolocation, terrain classification, and path-integrated attenuation estimation. A simulator based on the ray-tracing approach has been developed to reproduce the clutter reflectivity and the Doppler velocity signal for a conically scanning spaceborne Doppler radar system. The simulator exploits topographic information through a raster digital elevation model, land types from a regional classification database, and a normalized radar surface cross-section look-up table. The simulator is applied to the WInd VElocity Radar Nephoscop (WIVERN) mission, which proposes a conically scanning W-band Doppler radar to study in-cloud winds. Using an orbital model, detailed simulations for conical scans over the Piedmont region of Italy, which offers a variety of landscape conditions, are presented. The results highlight the strong departure of the reflectivity and Doppler velocity profiles in the presence of marked orography and the significant gradient in the surface radar backscattering properties. The simulations demonstrate the limitations and advantages of using the surface Doppler velocity over land as an antenna-pointing characterization technique. They represent the full strength range of the surface radar clutter over land surfaces for the WIVERN radar. The surface clutter tool applies to other spaceborne radar missions, such as the nadir-pointing EarthCARE and CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), or the cross-track scanning Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)  precipitation radars."

Crowther;Manuel Delgado-Baquerizo;Wenjie Liu;Yamin Jiang;Hongyang Sun;Zhiqiang Wang,Soil microbial necromass shapes global carbon stocks in agricultural and natural ecosystems,"We used a global dataset to examine patterns and drivers of fungal necromass C (FNC), bacterial necromass C (BNC), and their ratio across agricultural and natural ecosystems. FNC contributed about twice as much as BNC to SOC in both systems, with higher contributions overall in agricultural soils. Soil C/N and clay content mainly drove FNC and BNC contributions, while elevation primarily influenced the FNC/BNC ratio. 
 Soil carbon (C) plays an essential role in regulating global C cycle and climate. Microbial necromass is an important component of soil C, and yet the relative contribution of microbial necromass in shaping the global C stocks in agricultural and natural ecosystems worldwide remains virtually unknown. In this study, we compiled data on fungal and bacterial necromass along with soil organic carbon (SOC) from the 0–20 cm soil layer across 486 study sites (145 agricultural and 341 natural ecosystems) to evaluate the relative contribution of fungal necromass C (FNC) and bacterial necromass C (BNC) to SOC and the FNC/BNC ratio, after accounting for other biotic and abiotic factors. Our results indicated that, in both agricultural and natural ecosystems, the contribution of FNC to SOC significantly exceeded that of BNC, with FNC contributing approximately twice as much as BNC to SOC. However, the contributions of FNC and BNC to SOC were markedly higher in agricultural ecosystems than those in natural ecosystems, with a contrasting trend in the FNC/BNC ratio. Soil physicochemical properties (C/N and clay) were the most important predictors of the contributions of FNC and BNC to SOC in both ecosystems, while geographical factor (elevation) was the most important predictor of the FNC/BNC ratio. Our study enhances the current level of understanding regarding microbially mediated biogeochemical cycling and SOC dynamics, underscoring the critical role of microbial necromass in the global C cycle."
10.5194/essd-2025-286,False,Earth System Science Data Discussions,该研究论文主要关注海洋表面二氧化碳（pCO2）的变化，以及海洋在碳循环和气候变化中的作用。它利用深度学习模型和海洋生物地球化学模型，重建了1982年至2023年的全球月度pCO2数据集。研究重点在于提高对年际变率的表示，并更准确地捕捉海洋对气候事件（如厄尔尼诺现象）的响应。虽然与大气中的二氧化碳有关，但其重点在于海洋而非大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['ocean surface pCO2', 'air-sea CO2 flux', 'ocean carbon cycle', 'El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)', 'global carbon budget']",Xueying Zhang;Enhui Liao;Wenfang Lu;Zelun Wu;Guansuo Wang;Xueming Zhu;Shiyu Liang,A surface ocean pCO2 product with improved representation of interannual variability using a vision transformer-based model,"We created a new global dataset that reveals how ocean surface carbon dioxide has changed each month over the past four decades. By applying a deep learning model trained on both observational data and model simulations, we improved the representation of interannual variability and more accurately captured ocean responses to climate events like El Niño. This work supports global efforts to understand the ocean’s role in the carbon cycle and its response to climate change. 
 The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change, with the spatial distribution and temporal variations of ocean surface partial pressure of CO2 (spCO2) directly determining the air-sea CO2 flux. However, constructing a global spCO2 data product that is able to resolve interannual and decadal variability remains a challenge due to the spatial sparsity and temporal discontinuity of observational data. This study presents an approach based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, combining high-quality observational data from the CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) with multiple advanced global ocean biogeochemical models results to reconstruct a global monthly spCO2 dataset (SJTU-AViT) at 1° resolution from 1982 to 2023. The approach employs the self-attention mechanism of the ViT model to enhance the modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of spCO2, as well as incorporates physical-biogeochemical constraints from the derivative of spCO2 with respect to key controlling factors as additional features. The incorporation of advanced ocean biogeochemical models during the training process allows the ViT-based model to capture more accurate spCO2 variability in these data-sparse regions. Evaluations demonstrate that the new data product effectively captures spCO2 variability at both global and regional scales, showing good consistency with SOCAT observations, long-term ocean station data, and global atmospheric CO2 trends. The reconstructed spCO2 demonstrates strong capability in reproducing spCO2 anomalies during El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, particularly in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where it shows a correlation of 0.81 with the Niño 3.4 index and demonstrates high consistency with cruise data. Based on the SJTU-AViT dataset, the estimated global air-sea CO2 flux patterns are consistent with known regional features such as strong uptake in the Southern Ocean and outgassing in the tropical Pacific. This study not only provide a new 42-year data product for advancing understanding of the ocean carbon cycle and global carbon budget assessments, but also introduces a new Transformer-based deep learning framework for Earth system data reconstruction. The data product is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15331978 (Zhang et al., 2025) and will be updated regularly."

Our approach addresses underestimations in prior studies that rely heavily on slum geometry. Our dataset offers the first comprehensive inventory in data-sparse settings. This research offers valuable insights to support sustainable urban development goals, inform humanitarian aid distribution, and enhance the well-being in underserved communities. 
 Slums are a visible manifestation of poverty in Global South countries. Reliable estimation of slum population is crucial for urban planning, humanitarian aid provision, and improving well-being. However, large-scale and fine-grained mapping is still lacking due to inconsistent methodologies and definitions across countries. Existing datasets often rely on government statistics, lacking spatial continuity or underestimating slum population due to factors such as city image and privacy concerns. Here, we develop a standardized bottom-up approach to estimate slum population at the neighborhood level (~6.72 km resolution at the equator) for 129 Global South countries in 2018. Leveraging the Sustainable Development Goals 11.1 framework and machine learning, our estimation integrates household-based surveys, satellite imagery, and grided population data. Our models explain 82 % to 96 % of the variation in ground-truth surveys, with a root mean squared error of 4.85 % to 10.47 %, outperforming previous benchmarks. Cross-validation with independent data confirms the reliability of our estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive geospatial inventory of slum populations across Global South countries, offering valuable insights for advancing urban sustainability and supporting further research on vulnerable populations.

We added new carbon cycle processes and calibrated the model to observations and results from more complex models, enabling use over timescales ranging from decades to millions of years. SURFER v3.0 is fast, transparent, and easy to use, making it an ideal tool for policy assessments and suitable for educational purposes. 
 Simple climate models that are computationally inexpensive, transparent, and easy to modify are useful for assessing climate policies in the presence of uncertainties. This motivated the creation of SURFER v2.0, a model designed to estimate the impact of CO2 emissions and solar radiation modification on global mean temperatures, sea level rise, and ocean pH. However, SURFER v2.0 is unsuitable for simulations beyond a few thousand years because it lacks some carbon cycle processes. This is problematic for assessing the long-term evolution of the Earth system, particularly the dynamics of ice sheets and the resulting sea level rise. Here, we present SURFER v3.0, an extension to SURFER v2.0 that allows for accurate simulation of the climate, carbon cycle, and sea level rise on timescales ranging from decades to millions of years. We incorporated a dynamic cycling of alkalinity in the ocean, a carbonate sediments reservoir, and weathering fluxes into the model. With these additions, we show that SURFER v3.0 reproduces results from a large class of models, ranging from centennial Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) projections to 1 Myr runs performed with the cGENIE model of intermediate complexity. We show that compared to SURFER v2.0, including long-term carbon cycle processes in SURFER v3.0 leads to a stabilisation of the Greenland ice sheet for the middle of the road emission scenarios and to a significant reduction in the sea level rise contribution from Antarctica for high-emission scenarios."

Simulations in the Yellow River basin demonstrate its consistency with WRF-Hydro outputs, providing a reliable alternative to the original Noah-MP model. 
 The community Noah with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP) land surface model (LSM) is widely used in studies ranging from uncoupled land surface hydrometeorology and ecohydrology to coupled weather and climate predictions. In this study, we developed NMH-CS 3.0, a hydrological model written in C# (pronounced C sharp). NMH-CS 3.0 is a new model developed by faithfully translating Noah-MP, written in Fortran, from the uncoupled WRF-Hydro 3.0, and it is coupled with a river routing model. NMH-CS has the capacity to be executed on Windows systems, utilizing the multi-core CPUs commonly available in today's personal computers. The code of NMH-CS has been tested to ensure that it produces a high degree of consistency with the output of the original WRF-Hydro. High-resolution (6 km) simulations were conducted and assessed over a grid domain covering the entire Yellow River basin and most of northern China. The spatial maps and temporal variations in many state variables simulated by NMH-CS 3.0 and WRF-Hydro/Noah-MP demonstrate highly consistent results, occasionally with minor discrepancies. The river discharge for the Yellow River simulated by the new model with various scheme combinations of six parameterizations exhibits general agreement with the natural river discharge at the Lanzhou station. NMH-CS can be regarded as a reliable replica of Noah-MP in WRF-Hydro 3.0, but it can leverage the modern, powerful, and user-friendly features brought by the C# language to significantly improve the efficiency of the model's users and developers."

This study examines how global soil N2O emissions changed from 1961 to 2020 and identifies key factors driving these changes using an ecological model. The findings highlight croplands as the largest source, with factors like fertilizer use and climate change enhancing emissions. Rising CO2 levels, however, can partially mitigate N2O emissions through increased plant nitrogen uptake. 
 Nitrogen (N) transformation processes by soil microbes account for significant nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from natural ecosystems and cropland. However, understanding and quantifying global soil N2O emissions and their responses to changing environmental conditions remain challenging. Here, we implemented a soil nitrification–denitrification module into the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to estimate N2O emissions from global lands. The performance of this new development is examined using observed N2O fluxes from natural-soil and cropland field trials and independent global-scale estimates. LPJ-GUESS broadly reproduces the cumulative N2O emissions under different climate conditions and N fertilizer applications that are observed in the field experiments, with some deviations in emission seasonality. Globally, simulated soil N2O emissions from terrestrial ecosystems increase from 5.6±0.2 Tg N yr−1 in the 1960s to 9.9±0.3 Tg N yr−1 in the 2010s, with croplands contributing about two-thirds of the total increase. East Asia and South Asia show the fastest growth rates in N2O emissions over the study period due to the expansion of fertilized croplands. On a global scale, N fertilization (including synthetic fertilizer and manure use), atmospheric N deposition, and climate change contribute 58 %, 46 %, and 24 %, respectively, to the simulated soil N2O emissions in the 2010s. Rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere reduce the simulated emissions by 32 % through increased plant N uptake, whereas land use changes have varied spatial effects on emissions depending on N management intensity after land cover conversion. Our estimates only account for the direct soil N2O emissions, excluding those from fertilized pastures. This study highlights the importance of environmental factors in influencing global soil N2O emissions, particularly for assessing greenhouse gas mitigation potential in agricultural ecosystems."

This study employed metagenomic sequencing to investigate the airborne transmission of AMR in chicken farms (i.e., chicken feces, total suspended particles (TSP), and dust) and its exposure risks on the gut and nasal cavities of workers, office staff, and nearby villagers. Results revealed that TSP exhibited greater abundance, diversity, and transfer potential of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) compared to dust. The abundance of airborne resistome decreased with distance from the chicken house, and ARGs were estimated to spread up to 9.48 km within 1 h. While the gut resistome of workers and villagers showed limited differences, emerging tet(X) variants and high-risk dfrA remain future concerns. More nasal resistome was attributable to TSP compared to dust. Workers faced significantly higher inhalable exposures to antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and human pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (HPARB), exceeding those of office staff and villagers by an order of magnitude. We also compiled lists of high-risk and potential-risk airborne ARGs to inform monitoring.

The present study reports that pNO3– concentration in summer increased by 55.8% and 5.6% at North China Peak (1534 m a.s.l.) from 2007 to 2014 and 2014 to 2021, respectively. pNO3– formation enhancement was caused mainly by decreased aerosol acidity due to notable SO42– reduction. pNO3– formation changed from a process limited by NH4+ to one colimited by NO2 and NH4+, suggesting an increased effect of NOx reduction on decreasing pNO3– production. Vertical transport represents a significant source of pNO3– near the surface, illustrating a percentage as high as 98% recorded during daytime hours and a proportion of 34% in the dark over North China in the simulation scenario during summer 2020. The scheme to reduce NOx emissions by 10% from 2020 to 2025 is predicted to slowly decrease aloft pNO3– over North China, which may facilitate further reductions in pNO3– concentrations near the surface via vertical transport. The inflection of nitrate chemistry in the top boundary layer suggests an opportunity to accelerate PM2.5 reduction under projected further emission reductions."

In addition to nitrogen removal, it has the potential to control trace pollutants. However, the fates of toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) on denitrification remain unelucidated. The current study focused on Paracoccus denitrificans (P. denitrificans) to investigate the response mechanisms of denitrifying microorganisms to HAAs, one of the main categories of DBPs. Upon exposure to 20 μM monoiodoacetic acid (MIAA), the number of extracellular reactive oxygen species in P. denitrificans increased to 2.7 times at 16 h. Concurrently, the specific nitrate reduction rate dropped by 9.3% and the specific growth rate declined by 26.7%, leading to the slowdown of the denitrification process. Nevertheless, P. denitrificans increased the activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport for sustainable denitrification under MIAA stress. Microbial hydrolytic dehalogenation contributed to over 70.0% MIAA removal, and it led to the release of iodine ions. MIAA was detoxified and concerted into low-molecular-weight organic acids, which then participated in carbon metabolism. The removal efficiency of different toxic HAAs was also compared to evaluate the adaptiveness of the DBP control. This research highlighted the interactions between denitrifying microorganisms and DBPs, providing new insights into the ecological safety protection of high-quality reclaimed water."

The plastic biodegradation process in sediments, a major reservoir of plastic contamination with reduced redox conditions, remains elusive. This study compared the plastisphere communities and metabolic potentials of typical polyethylene (PE) contaminants collected from the Pearl River Estuary to their counterparts in the surrounding sediments. The results revealed a distinct plastisphere community composition, with the consistent enrichment of a group of core plastisphere populations compared to those of the sediments. Functional genes related to both potential aerobic and anaerobic PE biodegradation were encoded by the core plastisphere populations. Microcosm incubations were performed to assess the PE biodegradation potentials under denitrifying conditions. The results demonstrated that the polyethylene (PE) mineralization efficiencies were comparable under aerobic and denitrifying conditions through incubations with 13C-PE. Development of functional groups on PE surfaces and the reduction in molecular weights further supported PE biodegradation under denitrifying conditions. The elevated laccase and lignin peroxidase activities implied their potential contribution to PE depolymerization under denitrifying conditions. Together, the sediment plastisphere microbiome holds the potential for plastic degradation under denitrifying conditions, which should be considered when assessing the fate of plastic contaminants."

The model parameters were calibrated and validated using monitored runoff volumes and pesticide concentrations, employing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The results indicated that the developed model performed well, matching or exceeding the performance of traditional NPS models in small urban areas. NPS pesticide pollution in this area exhibited spatiotemporal characteristics impacted by meteorological conditions. Washoff loads were positively correlated with maximum pesticide concentrations and runoff volumes but not when they were preceded by dry periods.

Herein, the EMSI effect was engineered by constructing the serial Pt catalysts supported on CuO–Fe3O4 bimetal oxide (Pt/CFO). Among them, the 0.5Pt/CFO catalyst with 0.5 wt % Pt loading exhibited an outstanding catalytic activity, with T90 (the temperature of 90% toluene conversion) lowered to 185 °C, and displayed excellent stability and water resistance. Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations revealed that an evident electron transfer occurred via the interface structure (Pt–O–Fe), producing the positively charged Pt (Ptδ+) and abundant Fe2+ species. Notably, the increased electron density around the Fe species weakened the Fe–O bond and thus activated the surface lattice oxygen (Olatt). Further, temperature-programmed desorption experiments and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results demonstrated that the electron-deficient Ptδ+ was conducive to the adsorption and activation of toluene at low temperature. Consequently, the deep oxidation of toluene was achieved with the participation of Olatt, benefiting from the Ptδ+–O–Fe2+ interfacial sites with synergistic catalysis for toluene adsorption and oxygen activation. This work provides an interesting idea to explore the relationship between the electron transfer effect and highly efficient VOC abatement."

We conducted a systematic literature review on microorganism removal by physical treatment processes used in drinking water treatment systems with the aim of providing current summary data to update the World Health Organization’s Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (GDWQ) and to reflect on the data available for comparison of treatment technologies. We reviewed peer-reviewed articles reporting original data that were published between 1997 and March 2022 on the following physical treatment technologies: roughing filters, storage reservoirs, bank filtration, conventional and high-rate clarification, dissolved air flotation, lime softening, granular media filtration, slow sand filtration, precoat filtration, membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, ceramic membrane filtration, and soil aquifer treatment. The literature search was conducted in several databases including Web of Science and PubMed. Data from 165 articles were included in the analysis and used to calculate Log Reduction Values (LRVs) for each technology by microbial contaminant type (bacteria, virus, or protozoa). The quantity and quality of data ranged widely for each technology. We found granular media, membranes (microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO)), and precoat filtration to remove the most protozoa with average LRVs of 3.0 (95% CI 2.8–3.3), 5.7 (95% CI 5.4–6.0), and 4.4 (95% CI 4.1–4.7), respectively. Bacteria was removed most effectively by membrane filtration (MF, UF, RO) with average LRVs of 4.5 (95% CI 3.9–5.1) and moderately by dissolved air flotation, lime softening, and soil aquifer treatment with average LRVs of 2.7, 2.6, and 2.4 respectively. Viruses were removed most effectively by reverse osmosis membrane filtration with an average LRV of 4.9 (95% CI 4.0–5.7). This data provides valuable information on pathogen reduction and areas of needed research. The variation in results underscores the importance of further consideration when selecting technologies to use and the need for standardized reporting in both lab and field studies. It is important to consider variables in water quality and technology operation that may impact treatment effectiveness when selecting treatment options for use.

However, the key parameters governing the reactivity of RHS via the SET pathway remain unclear. This study comprehensively investigated the SET pathway of the RHS with 51 aromatic contaminants by quantum-chemical calculations. The calculated free energy changes of the SET pathway (ΔGaq,SETR) followed the order Cl• < Cl2•– < Br• < Br2•–, which was consistent with the order of their reduction potentials. However, the free energy of activation of the SET pathway (ΔGaq,SET⧧) followed a different order of Cl• < Br• < Cl2•– < Br2•–, which agreed with the order of their rate constants. This inconsistent trend between ΔGaq,SETR and ΔGaq,SET⧧ for RHS reactions was attributed to the difference in reorganization energy, which is essentially related to the vertical electron affinity and radius of RHS. Therefore, the rate constants of SET reactions of RHS depend not only on their reduction potential but also on their vertical electron affinity and radius.

In this study, we recruited 20 AAs and 28 individuals of other races, oversampled for vapers, with no statistical differences in age, sex, sugar intake, income, or education across groups. Whole saliva samples collected at the time of the visit were processed for untargeted UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS proteomics and HPLC-MS/MS metabolomics. Our results revealed vaping preferentially impaired redox pathways and amino acid metabolism among AAs, with elevated malondialdehyde levels and an oxidized glutathione to glutathione ratio and lowered levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ascorbate. Salivary proteomics demonstrated salivary secretion was upregulated in AAs while Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, bacterial invasion defense, natural killer cell function, leukocyte migration, and phagosome function were downregulated, suggesting dysregulated innate immune function in AA vapers. Additionally, focal adhesion, cell–substrate junction, and actin cytoskeleton regulation were downregulated in AA vapers, indicating that mucous epithelium barrier integrity may be disrupted. Lastly, the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Need (CPITN), a dental assessment tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate periodontal health and determine the need for treatment, revealed that a significantly higher proportion of AA vapers had CPITN scores of 3 or higher, suggesting the need for further clinical assessment of periodontal disease. Collectively, our results suggest that AAs may be more susceptible to oral health effects of vaping than individuals of other racial groups, with elevated levels of oxidative stress, dysregulated innate immune function, mucous epithelium barrier integrity disruption, and varying nicotine metabolism."

However, a lack of efficient means and incomplete monitoring data are the main obstacles impeding soil pollution management and prevention in China. Moreover, it is rare to examine the possibility and reliability of using  field-collected earthworms to assess the pollution degree of soil heavy metals in real-world situations at a large field scale. In this study, we investigate the potential use of field-collected earthworms as bio-indicators to assess the pollution characteristics and risks of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cd, and Cr) across three typical regions (Xiaokeng Reservoir, Dabaoshan Mine, and Smelter/Steel Plants) in Shaoguan, one of six trial zones identified for the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in China. Our results unveil the existence of significant differences in the spatial distribution and bioavailability of heavy metals in soils and earthworms across these regions. The average contents of Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cr, and Cd in soils were 329.7 ± 476.5, 180.9 ± 262.4, 82.9 ± 197.8, 66.6 ± 61.6, 53.3 ± 53.6, and 7.2 ± 8.2 mg/kg, while those in earthworms were 113.6 ± 112.1, 99.4 ± 106.8, 90.0 ± 126.9, 24.7 ± 30.8, 8.8 ± 9.4, and 5.1 ± 3.4 mg/kg, respectively. The internal exposure dose of heavy metals in earthworms is found to more accurately reflect their bioavailability under true environmental conditions than the external exposure dose in soils. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) exhibited the highest values for Cd (0.01–24.40), followed by those for Pb (0.06–9.94), Cu (0.12–5.23), Cr (0.02–1.90), As (0.02–1.18), and Zn (0.06–1.17). Further principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest (RF) classification ascertain that earthworms are more capable of differentiating heavy metal pollution in different regions than soil alone. Compared to the routine analysis of the total heavy metal content in soils, our novel strategy demonstrates the superiority of employing field-collected earthworms as bio-indicators for monitoring heavy metal pollution and discriminating potential sources of soil pollution in a real scenario."

To understand that, we studied participants from two representative towns in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, China. Lung function parameters (FVC%, FEV1%, and FEV1/FVC) were measured, while PFAS concentrations in urine and indoor dust were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We measured the levels of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α (8-epi-PGF2α), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in urine. The results demonstrated a preponderance of short-chain PFAS in urine, with PFBS, PFPeA, and PFBA showing the highest detection rates. PFBA had the highest median concentration at 0.47 ng/mL. Similarly, in indoor dust, PFBA was the most frequently detected, followed by PFOA, with median concentrations of 0.56 and 0.44 ng/g, respectively. Multiple PFAS compounds showed significant inverse correlations with FVC% and FEV1%. PFAS exposure was associated with elevated oxidative stress biomarker levels (8-OHdG, 8-epi-PGF2α, and MDA), and their synergistic interaction aggravated the decline in lung function. This research provides valuable evidence of PFAS exposure patterns in the plateau population, highlighting the dominance of short-chain PFAS compounds and the concerning link between PFAS exposure and impaired lung function."

 Bacteria defend themselves from viral predation using diverse immune systems, many of which target foreign DNA for degradation1. Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by leveraging DNA synthesis instead2,3. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene that encodes an antiviral effector protein, Neo4,5. It remains unknown whether similar mechanisms of defense are employed by other related DRT families. Focusing on DRT9, here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of DNA homopolymer synthesis. Viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell, driving abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal how a noncoding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and poly-dA synthesis. Remarkably, biochemical and functional experiments identify tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that likely prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of high-molecular weight protein-DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA by DRT9 in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers. Collectively, our work unveils a novel nucleic acid-driven defense system that expands the paradigm of bacterial immunity and broadens the known functions of reverse transcriptases."

 The shale gas revolution has shifted propylene production from naphtha cracking to on-purpose production with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as the dominant technology1-9. Because PDH is endothermic and requires high temperatures that favour sintering and coking, the challenge is to develop active and stable catalysts1-3 that are sufficiently stable10,11. Zeolite-supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been developed to balance activity, selectivity and stability12,13, and more recent work documented a PDH catalyst based on zeolite-anchored single rhodium atoms with exceptional performance and stability14. Here we show for silicalite-1 (S-1) that migration of encapsulated Pt-Sn2 clusters and hence agglomeration and anchoring within the zeolite versus agglomeration on the external surface can be controlled by adjusting the length of the S-1 crystals’ b-axis. We find that when this axis is longer than 2.00 μm, migration of Pt-Sn2 monomers during PDH results in intra-crystalline formation of (Pt-Sn2)2 dimers that are securely locked in the channels of S-1 and capable of converting pure propane feed to propylene at 550 °C for more than 6 months with 98.3% selectivity at 91% equilibrium conversion. This performance exceeds that of other Pt-based PDH catalysts and approaches that of the Rh-based catalyst. While synthesis requirements and cost are currently prohibitive for industrial use, we anticipate that our approach to controlling the migration and lockup of metals in zeolites may enable to development of other noble metal catalysts that offer extended service lifetimes in industrial applications15-17."

 The multicellular coordination that underlies tissue homeostasis and disease progression is of fundamental interest1–5. However, how diverse cell types are organized within tissue niches for cohesive functioning remains largely unknown. Here we systematically characterized cross-tissue coordinated cellular modules in healthy tissues, uncovering their spatiotemporal dynamics and phenotypic associations, and examined their rewiring in cancer. We first compiled a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas from 35 human tissues, revealing substantial inter-tissue variability in cellular composition. By leveraging covariance in cellular abundance, we identified 12 cellular modules with distinct cellular compositions, tissue prevalences and spatial organizations, and demonstrated coordinated intercellular communication within cellular modules using in situ spatial and in vivo perturbation data. Among them, two immune cellular modules in the spleen showed contrasting chronological dynamics with ageing. Analysis of multicellular changes in the breast revealed a menopausal trajectory associated with fibroblast dynamics. Furthermore, interrogation across cancer types uncovered simultaneous rewiring of two types of multicellular ecosystem during tumour progression, including the loss of tissue-specific healthy organization and the emergence of a convergent cancerous ecosystem. These findings reveal fundamental organizing principles of multicellular ecosystems in health and cancer, laying a foundation for further investigations into tissue-level functional coordination across diverse contexts.

 Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) are central to physiology1,2. Excess mROS production has been associated with several disease states2,3; however, the precise sources, regulation and mechanism of generation in vivo remain unclear, which limits translational efforts. Here we show that in obesity, hepatic coenzyme Q (CoQ) synthesis is impaired, which increases the CoQH2 to CoQ (CoQH2/CoQ) ratio and drives excessive mROS production through reverse electron transport (RET) from site IQ in complex I. Using multiple complementary genetic and pharmacological models in vivo, we demonstrate that RET is crucial for metabolic health. In patients with steatosis, the hepatic CoQ biosynthetic program is also suppressed, and the CoQH2/CoQ ratio positively correlates with disease severity. Our data identify a highly selective mechanism for pathological mROS production in obesity, which can be targeted to protect metabolic homeostasis.

 Recently, a class of long-period radio transients (LPTs) has been discovered, exhibiting emission thousands of times longer than radio pulsars1–5. These findings, enabled by advances in wide-field radio surveys, challenge existing models of rotationally powered pulsars. Proposed models include highly magnetized neutron stars6, white-dwarf pulsars7 and white-dwarf binary systems with low-mass companions8. Although some models predict X-ray emission6,9, no LPTs have been detected in X-rays despite extensive searches1–5,10.

Its correlated and highly variable X-ray and radio luminosities, combined with other observational properties, are unlike any known Galactic object. The source could be an old magnetar or an ultra-magnetized white dwarf; however, both interpretations present theoretical challenges. This X-ray detection from an LPT reveals that these objects are more energetic than previously thought and establishes a class of hour-scale periodic X-ray transients with a luminosity of about 1033 erg s−1 linked to exceptionally bright coherent radio emission.

 The emergence of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by fungal pathogens, poses serious threats to public health, wildlife and ecosystem stability1. Host–fungus interactions and environmental factors have been extensively examined2–4. However, the role of genetic variability in pathogens is often less well-studied, even for diseases such as white-nose in bats, which has caused one of the highest disease-driven death tolls documented in nonhuman mammals5. Previous research on white-nose disease has primarily focused on variations in disease outcomes attributed to host traits or environmental conditions6–8, but has neglected pathogen variability. Here we leverage an extensive reference collection of 5,479 fungal isolates from 27 countries to reveal that the widespread causative agent is not a single species but two sympatric cryptic species, each exhibiting host specialization. Our findings provide evidence of recombination in each species, but significant genetic differentiation across their genomes, including differences in genome organization. Both species contain geographically differentiated populations, which enabled us to identify the species introduced to North America and trace its source population to a region in Ukraine. In light of our discovery of the existence of two cryptic species of the causative agent of white-nose disease, our research underscores the need to integrate the study of pathogen variability into comprehensive disease surveillance, management and prevention strategies. This holistic approach is crucial for enhancing our understanding of diseases and implementing effective measures to prevent their spread.

 Self-recognition is a fundamental cellular process across evolution and forms the basis of neuronal self-avoidance1–4. Clustered protocadherin (cPcdh) proteins, which comprise a large family of isoform-specific homophilic recognition molecules, have a pivotal role in the neuronal self-avoidance that is required for mammalian brain development5–7. The probabilistic expression of different cPcdh isoforms confers unique identities on neurons and forms the basis for neuronal processes to discriminate between self and non-self5,6,8. Whether this self-recognition mechanism also exists in astrocytes remains unknown. Here we report that γC3, a specific isoform in the Pcdhγ family, is enriched in human and mouse astrocytes. Using genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that γC3 acts autonomously to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse visual cortex. To determine whether γC3 proteins act by promoting recognition between processes of the same astrocyte, we generated pairs of γC3 chimeric proteins that are capable of heterophilic binding to each other, but incapable of homophilic binding. Co-expression of complementary heterophilic binding isoform pairs in the same γC3-null astrocyte restored normal morphology.

Saper,Preoptic EP3R neurons constitute a two-way switch for fever and torpor,"Neurons in the median preoptic nucleus that express the prostaglandin EP3 receptor produce prolonged hypothermic responses or hyperthermic responses, respectively, following brief activation or inhibition. 
 Many species use a temporary decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate (torpor) as a strategy to survive food scarcity in a cool environment. Torpor is caused by preoptic neurons that express a variety of peptides and receptors1–7, but no single genetic marker has been found for this population. Here we report that expression of the prostaglandin EP3 receptor (EP3R) marks a unique population of median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) neurons that are required for both torpor and lipopolysaccharide-induced fever8. The MnPO-EP3R neurons produce persistent fever responses when inhibited and prolonged hypothermic responses when activated either chemogenetically or optogenetically, even for brief periods of time. The mechanism for these prolonged responses appears to involve increases in intracellular levels of cAMP and calcium that may persist for many minutes up to hours beyond the termination of a stimulus. These properties endow the population of MnPO-EP3R neurons with the ability to act as a two-way switch for the hypothermic and hyperthermic responses that are required for survival. Neurons in the median preoptic nucleus that express the prostaglandin EP3 receptor produce prolonged hypothermic responses or hyperthermic responses, respectively, following brief activation or inhibition."

 Surface albedo greatly affects how much energy the Earth absorbs. Intensive human activities and accelerated climate change have altered surface albedo across spatial and temporal scales1–3, yet assessments of the effects of land use or land cover (LULC) and snow variations on land surface albedo are scarce at the global scale. As a result, the global land surface albedo dynamics over recent decades and their corresponding radiative forcing to the climate system remain poorly understood4–9. Here we quantify the individual and combined effects of snow cover dynamics, LULC conversions and non-conversion regions on albedo variations during 2001–2020 and estimate their induced radiative forcing. We show that the negative radiative forcing induced by the global land surface albedo change was −0.142 (−0.158, −0.114) W m−2 over the past two decades. The global snow-free land surface albedo increased by 2.2% (P < 0.001), with a negative radiative forcing of −0.164 (−0.186, −0.138) W m−2 (P < 0.001). The magnitude of this negative forcing is sevenfold larger than the positive forcing induced by snow dynamics, and equivalent to 59.9% of that caused by CO2 emissions from 2011 to 201910. The global radiative forcing due to albedo changes in LULC non-conversion regions is 3.9 to 8.1 times greater than that from LULC conversions. The radiative forcing induced by albedo changes highlights the important role of land surface dynamics in modulating global warming. Effects of snow cover dynamics, land use or land cover conversions and non-conversion regions on albedo variations during 2001–2020 are quantified and their induced radiative forcing estimated, highlighting the role of land surface dynamics in modulating global warming."

 Terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—formed by the accretion of smaller objects. The Earth was probably the latest terrestrial planet to form and reached about 99% of its final mass within about 60–100 Myr after condensation of the first solids in the Solar System. This Review examines the disproportionate role of the last approximately 1% of planetary growth, or late accretion, in controlling the long-term evolution of the Earth and other terrestrial planets. Late accretion may have been responsible for shaping Earth’s distinctive geophysical and chemical properties and generating pathways conducive to prebiotic chemistry. Differences in the late accretion of a planet may provide a rationale for interpreting the distinct properties of Venus and Earth (for example, tectonism, atmospheric composition, water content), the surface dichotomy of Mars and the high core-to-silicate mass ratio of Mercury. Large collisions and ensuing processes are likely to occur and modulate the evolution of rocky exoplanets as well, and they should be considered in our quest to find Earth-like worlds.

 Air pollution affects climate through various complex interactions1. It perturbs the Earth’s radiative energy balance and alters the atmospheric oxidation capacity, which determines the lifetimes of short-lived climate forcers, such as methane1. A key mechanism in this dynamic is the impact of air pollutants on the hydroxyl radical (OH), the most important oxidant in the troposphere, which accounts for approximately 90% of the methane chemical sink2. However, a comprehensive quantification of the interactions between air pollutants, OH and methane over decadal timescales remains incomplete2. Here we develop an integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach to quantify how variations in key air pollutants influence the methane chemical sink and alter the methane budget. Our results indicate that, from 2005 to 2021, enhanced tropospheric ozone, increased water vapour and decreased carbon monoxide levels collectively contributed to a 1.3–2.0 Tg year−1 increase per year in the global methane sink, thereby buffering atmospheric methane growth rates. This increase in the methane sink was primarily concentrated in tropical regions and exhibited a north–south asymmetry. Periods of high methane growth were typically linked to abrupt OH level declines driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events such as mega wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study suggests a trade-off between O3 pollution control and methane removal mediated by OH and highlights the risk of increasing carbon monoxide emissions from widespread wildfires. An integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach demonstrates that, from 2005 to 2021, periods of high atmospheric methane growth were linked to trends and variations in OH levels driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events."

 Lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated ex vivo gene therapy for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has delivered on the promise of a ‘one-and-done’ treatment for several genetic diseases1. However, ex vivo manipulation and patient conditioning before transplantation are major hurdles that could be overcome by an in vivo approach. Here we demonstrate that in vivo gene delivery to HSPCs after systemic LV administration is enabled by the substantial trafficking of these cells from the liver to the bone marrow in newborn mice. We improved gene-transfer efficiency using a phagocytosis-shielded LV, successfully reaching bona fide HSPCs capable of long-term multilineage output and engraftment after serial transplantation, as confirmed by clonal tracking. HSPC mobilization further increased gene transfer, extending the window of intervention, although permissiveness to LV transduction declined with age. We successfully tested this in vivo strategy in mouse models of adenosine deaminase deficiency, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis and Fanconi anaemia. Interestingly, in vivo gene transfer provided a selective advantage to corrected HSPCs in Fanconi anaemia, leading to near-complete haematopoietic reconstitution and prevention of bone marrow failure. Given that circulating HSPCs in humans are also most abundant shortly after birth, in vivo HSPC gene transfer holds strong translational potential across multiple diseases. In vivo gene delivery to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in newborn mice using engineered lentiviral vectors shows promise as an effective treatment for genetic diseases."

 There is ongoing debate as to when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved on Earth1,2. Geochemical data from ancient sediments indicate localized or ephemeral photosynthetic O2 production before the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) approximately 2.5–2.3 billion years ago (Ga), and currently suggest Archaean origins, approximately 3 Ga or earlier3–9. However, sedimentary records of the early Earth often suffer from preservation issues, and poor control on the timing of oxidation leaves geochemical proxy data for the ancient presence of O2 open to critique10–13. Here, we report rare Earth element data from three different Archaean carbonate platforms preserved in greenstone belts of the northwest Superior Craton (Canada), which were deposited by the activity of marine photosynthetic bacteria 2.87 Ga, 2.85 Ga and 2.78 Ga. All three indicate O2 production before the GOE in the form of significant depletions in cerium (Ce), reflecting oxidative Ce removal from ancient seawater, as occurs today14. Using 138La-138Ce geochronology, we show that La/Ce fractionation, and thus Ce oxidation, occurred at the time of deposition, making these the oldest directly dated Ce anomalies. These results place the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Mesoarchaean or earlier and bring an important new perspective on a long-standing debate regarding Earth’s biological and geochemical evolution. 138La-138Ce geochronology shows that La/Ce fractionation, and Ce oxidation, occurred at the time of deposition, placing the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis in the Mesoarchaean or earlier."

 Doping is a primary method to modulate the electrical properties of semiconductors, enabling the fabrication of various homojunctions/heterojunctions and complex devices1–8. For organic semiconductors (OSCs), the electrical performance has been extensively improved by developing doping methods and dopants9–13. However, compared with the state-of-the-art spatial resolution of inorganic semiconductor fabrication processes, OSCs lag far behind, limiting the construction of complex organic electronic devices5. Here we present a facile light-triggered doping strategy and develop a series of inactive photoactivable dopants (iPADs) for regionally controlled n-doping of OSCs. By converting iPADs into active dopants through ultraviolet (UV) exposure, controllable doping of various n-type OSCs with high electrical conductivity greater than 30 S cm−1 has been realized. Using iPADs can substantially improve the performances of OSCs in transistors, logic circuits and thermoelectrics. Also, regionally controlled doping is demonstrated in OSCs with a record resolution down to 1 μm. Overall, our strategy has achieved tunable doping levels in OSCs with high spatial resolution, which is expected to be highly suited for integrated circuits in both roll-to-roll and laboratory-scale environments.

 Fast thermal dephasing limits macroscopic quantum phenomena to cryogenic conditions1–4 and hinders their use at ambient temperatures5,6. For electronic excitations in condensed media, dephasing is mediated by thermal lattice motion1,7,8. Therefore, taming the lattice influence is essential for creating collective electronic quantum states at high temperatures. Although there are occasional reports of high-Tc quantum effects across different platforms, it is unclear which lattice characteristics and electron–lattice interactions lead to macroscopically coherent electronic states in solids9. Here we studied intensity fluctuations in the macroscopic polarization during the emergence of superfluorescence in a lead halide perovskite10 and showed that spontaneously synchronized polaronic lattice oscillations accompany collective electronic dipole emission. We further developed an effective field model and theoretically confirmed that exciton–lattice interactions lead to a new electronically and structurally entangled coherent extended solitonic state beyond a critical polaron density. The analysis shows a phase transition with two processes happening in tandem: incoherent disordered polaronic lattice deformations establish an order, while macroscopic quantum coherence among excitons simultaneously emerges. Recombination of excitons in this state culminates in superfluorescence at high temperatures. Our study establishes fundamental connections between the transient superfluorescence process observed after the impulsive excitation of perovskites and general equilibrium phase transitions achieved by thermal cooling. By identifying various electron–lattice interactions in the perovskite structure and their respective role in creating collectively coherent electronic effects in solids, our work provides unprecedented insight into the design and development of new materials that exhibit high-temperature macroscopic quantum phenomena.

 Early or sorting endosomes are dynamic organelles that play key roles in proteome control by triaging plasma membrane proteins for either recycling or degradation in the lysosome1,2. These events are coordinated by numerous transiently associated regulatory complexes and integral membrane components that contribute to organelle identity during endosome maturation3. Although a subset of the several hundred protein components and cargoes known to associate with endosomes have been studied at the biochemical and/or structural level, interaction partners and higher-order molecular assemblies for many endosomal components remain unknown.

We present 229 structural models for endosomal protein pairs and additional higher-order assemblies supported by experimental crosslinks from their native subcellular context, suggesting structural mechanisms for previously reported regulatory processes.

 The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits1–8. Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres9,10. However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry11–22. Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level. Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements. Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets. Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry. We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits.

 Scientists and inventors set the direction of their work amid evolving questions, opportunities and challenges, yet the understanding of pivots between research areas and their outcomes remains limited1–5. Theories of creative search highlight the potential benefits of exploration but also emphasize difficulties in moving beyond one’s expertise6–14. Here we introduce a measurement framework to quantify how far researchers move from their existing work, and apply it to millions of papers and patents. We find a pervasive ‘pivot penalty’, in which the impact of new research steeply declines the further a researcher moves from their previous work. The pivot penalty applies nearly universally across science and patenting, and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. Larger pivots further exhibit weak engagement with established mixtures of prior knowledge, lower publication success rates and less market impact. Unexpected shocks to the research landscape, which may push researchers away from existing areas or pull them into new ones, further demonstrate substantial pivot penalties, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pivot penalty generalizes across fields, career stage, productivity, collaboration and funding contexts, highlighting both the breadth and depth of the adaptive challenge. Overall, the findings point to large and increasing challenges in effectively adapting to new opportunities and threats, with implications for individual researchers, research organizations, science policy and the capacity of science and society as a whole to confront emergent demands.

 Specialized immune cells that reside in tissues orchestrate diverse biological functions by communicating with parenchymal cells1. The contribution of the innate immune compartment in the meninges and the central nervous system (CNS) is well-characterized; however, whether cells of the adaptive immune system reside in the brain and are involved in maintaining homeostasis is unclear2–4. Here we show that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain is a nucleus for parenchymal αβ T cells in the steady-state brain in both mice and humans. Using unbiased transcriptomics, we show that these extravascular T cells in the brain are distinct from meningeal T cells: they secrete IFNγ robustly and express tissue-residence proteins such as CXCR6, which are required for their retention in the brain and for normal adaptive behaviour. These T cells are primed in the periphery by the microbiome, and traffic from the white adipose and gastrointestinal tissues to the brain. Once established, their numbers can be modulated by alterations to either the gut microbiota or the composition of adipose tissue. In summary, we find that CD4 T cells reside in the brain at steady state and are anatomically concentrated in the SFO in mice and humans; that they are transcriptionally and functionally distinct from meningeal T cells; and that they secrete IFNγ to maintain CNS homeostasis through homeostatic fat–brain and gut–brain axes.

 Lakes are crucial for ecosystems1, greenhouse gas emissions2 and water resources3, yet their surface-extent dynamics, particularly seasonality, remain poorly understood at continental to global scales owing to limitations in satellite observations4,5. Although previous studies have focused on long-term changes6–8, comprehensive assessments of seasonality have been constrained by trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal resolution in single-source satellite data. Here we show that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally. By leveraging a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat-based datasets, combined with high-performance computing, we achieved monthly mapping of 1.4 million lakes (2001–2023). Our approach yielded basin-level median user’s and producer’s accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, when validated against the Global Surface Water dataset7. Seasonality-dominated lakes constitute 66% of the global lake area and approximately 60% of total lake counts, with over 90% of the world’s population residing in regions where such lakes prevail. During seasonality-induced extreme events, the impacts can exceed the combined magnitude of 23-year long-term changes and regular seasonal variations, doubling the contraction of 42% of shrinking lakes and fully offsetting the expansion of 45% of growing lakes. These results uncover previously hidden seasonal dynamics that are crucial for understanding hydrospheric responses to environmental changes9, protecting lacustrine systems10–12 and improving global climate models13,14. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating seasonality into future research and suggest that advancements in the fusion of multisource remote-sensing data offer a promising path forward.

 Cannabis sativa is a globally important seed oil, fibre and drug-producing plant species. However, a century of prohibition has severely restricted development of breeding and germplasm resources, leaving potential hemp-based nutritional and fibre applications unrealized. Here we present a cannabis pangenome, constructed with 181 new and 12 previously released genomes from a total of 144 biological samples including both male (XY) and female (XX) plants. We identified widespread regions of the cannabis pangenome that are surprisingly diverse for a single species, with high levels of genetic and structural variation, and propose a novel population structure and hybridization history. Across the ancient heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes, we observed a variable boundary at the sex-determining and pseudoautosomal regions as well as genes that exhibit male-biased expression, including genes encoding several key flowering regulators. Conversely, the cannabinoid synthase genes, which are responsible for producing cannabidiol acid and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, contained very low levels of diversity, despite being embedded within a variable region with multiple pseudogenized paralogues, structural variation and distinct transposable element arrangements. Additionally, we identified variants of acyl-lipid thioesterase genes that were associated with fatty acid chain length variation and the production of the rare cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabidivarin. We conclude that the C. sativa gene pool remains only partially characterized, the existence of wild relatives in Asia is likely and its potential as a crop species remains largely unrealized.

 Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electronvolt (eV)-scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications1,2. A variety of such magnetic states with non-trivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d-wave, g-wave or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets3–7. Achieving voltage-based control of the non-uniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energy-efficient and compact devices for information storage and processing8,9. Spin-spiral type II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order that directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry-protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order10–14. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principles calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent an observation of p-wave magnetism in a spin-spiral type II multiferroic, which may lead to the development of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets. Experimental observations and theoretical analysis provide evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits p-wave magnetism and its spin chirality is related to ferroelectric polarization, which can be electrically controlled. "

Here, we report the water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions and their distribution in farside IGBs collected by the Chang’e-6 mission to investigate the role of IGBs in the lunar surface water cycle.

The SW-H2O hydration depths in farside IGBs are strikingly shallower than in nearside IGBs. Moreover, the hydration profiles are only found in mare IGBs, with none observed in non-mare IGBs, indicating that SW-H2O hydration in IGBs is likely composition dependent.

 It is highly desirable that artificial circularly polarized phosphorescent materials with high luminescence asymmetry factor (glum), narrowband emission and tunable chiral phosphorescent performance can be constructed. Especially, precise control and simultaneous independent switching of circularly polarized fluorescent and phosphorescent performance for the same molecules remain a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to customized design of circularly polarized phosphorescent materials based on large language models and transfer learning methods, which not only enables efficient identification of suitable synthesis precursors, but also provides valuable guidance for experimental procedures. We demonstrate the significant advantages of transfer learning with limited chemical data, and precisely fabricate films with high glum (1.86), narrow full-width at half-maximum (49 nm) and customized circularly polarized phosphorescent performance with targeted spectral position. The inverse customization of materials with user-specified circularly polarized fluorescent/phosphorescent performance can be achieved, favoring their application in multicolor display and multidimensional information encryption.

This new configuration produces lower shortwave surface albedo in the tropics but higher albedo in boreal regions (>5 W m−2 radiative flux differences), and a weaker tropical but stronger boreal carbon sink. Through land-atmosphere coupling, the PFC-based configuration further alters atmospheric processes, leading to different temperature, cloud cover, and precipitation patterns. Our findings highlight the need to move beyond traditional PFT-based approaches in ESMs. Earth system models often categorize plants to just a few functional types, and plant characteristics are defined per type, neglecting their diversity. The authors show how the use of plant traits can improve the modeling of global carbon, water, and energy fluxes"

Here, the authors discover that CEACAM1, an immunoglobulin-like transmembrane protein, is essential for a subset of mantle cell lymphoma through activation of the BCR. 
 B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, through a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we identify carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) as an essential factor in a subset of MCL tumors. Our signal transduction studies reveal that CEACAM1 plays a critical role in BCR activation through involvement in two dynamic processes. First, following BCR engagement, CEACAM1 co-localizes to the membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) by anchoring to the F-actin cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein filamin A. Second, CEACAM1 recruits and increases the abundance of SYK in the BCR complex leading to BCR activation. These activities of CEACAM1 require its cytoplasmic tail and the N-terminal ectodomain. Considering that previous studies have extensively characterized CEACAM1 as an ITIM-bearing inhibitory receptor, our findings regarding its activating role are both surprising and context-dependent, which may have implications for BCR-targeting therapies.

 Electrocatalysis offers a promising route to convert CO2 into alcohols, which is most efficient in a two-step cascade reaction with CO2-to-CO followed by CO-to-alcohol. However, current alcohol-producing CO2/CO electrolyzers suffer from low selectivity or alcohol crossover, resulting in alcohol concentrations of less than 1%, which are further diluted in downstream cold-traps. As a result, electrocatalytic alcohol production has yet to be scaled beyond the lab (1-10 cm2). Here, we reverse the electroosmotic drag of water using a cation exchange membrane assembly, enabling the recovery of over 85% of alcohol products at a concentration of 6 wt.%. We develop a multi-step condenser strategy to separate the produced alcohols from the effluent gas stream without dilution. Scaling up this approach to an 800 cm2 cell resulted in an output of 200 mL alcohol/day.

 Chemical upcycling has the potential to turn plastic wastes into valuable chemicals and promote the circularity of plastics. Polysulfones and relevant composites are plastics with notable chemical durability, resistance and survivability. They are known as super engineering plastics, but they pose enormous challenges for reuse and upcycling. Here we develop a strategy for the chemical upcycling of polysulfones through copper-photocatalysed dual desulfonylative chlorination at ambient conditions, affording high-value-added dichlorinated diaryl ethers. The key to this strategy is cascade homolytic ipso-aromatic substitutions with high selectivity using the chlorine radical. Various types of polysulfones were successfully depolymerized and functionalized, including 12 examples of resins and eight examples of end-of-life plastics. Through gram-scale upcycling and mixed-plastic treatment, we further demonstrated the excellent compatibility and practicality of our strategy. Overall, this work establishes a viable approach for upcycling waste plastics into valuable chemicals, thus contributing to more sustainable plastic waste management and to realizing the circular economy.

 Improving the sustainability of the steel industry requires decarbonization strategies that are both technically and economically viable. The recovery of both material and heat on site is a promising approach but largely unexplored. Here we propose a scheme integrating heat recovery, carbon mineralization and the use of slag in cement production, along with the blast-furnace injection of hydrogen from off-gas. The proposed scheme, based on the synergistic use of coke oven gas and slag, can reduce CO2 emissions by 48% compared to the conventional approach. When coupled with an external gas supply from coal gasification or biomass pyrolysis, CO2 emissions can drop by 63% and 92%, respectively. The cost of avoiding CO2 emissions could be less than half the cost of conventional industrial capture and could be offset by the projected carbon price by 2030. For the steel industry in China, we find that the scheme is applicable to over 46% of existing steel mills, resulting in 16 provinces meeting the 2 °C target and 19 provinces surpassing the 50% national mitigation target.

 Large-scale atmospheric variability can be summarized by recurring patterns called weather regimes. Their properties, including predictability, have been studied using the local dimension, a geometrical estimate of degrees of freedom from multifractal theory. Local dimension estimates vary across regimes, decrease when a single regime dominates, and increase during transitions, supporting their dynamical significance. However, these variations stem not only from geometry but also from sampling density. We develop a null-hypothesis test using stochastic twins-Gaussian mixture-based surrogates matching atmospheric sampling density but with constant geometry-applied to ERA5 500 hPa fields. Density effects alone explain over 25% of local dimension variance and reproduce the dimension drop near regime peaks, indicating this behavior is density-driven, not geometric. The remaining variability is plausibly geometry-driven. This approach, applicable to any observed system with known sampling distribution, offers a new framework for interpreting local dimension estimates in atmospheric and oceanic data."

Diagnostic analyses such as synergistic diagnostic and linear baroclinic model (LBM) experiments show that the warm AMOCORE and WPSST in boreal summer can generate the localized heat dome (HD) over Mongolia to northeast China by exciting local convection and subsequent propagation, respectively, which in turn directly influences the CECSH decadal variability through compression of the atmosphere and temperature transport.

 Elemental carbon (EC), predominantly produced by solid fuel combustion, significantly influences both climate and public health. However, the physicochemical properties of EC-containing particles immediately after emission remain inadequately understood. This study investigates the chemical composition, size distribution, and mixing state of EC-containing particles from five solid fuels: wheat, corn, rice straw, bituminous coal, and anthracite. Using a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS), we identified seven distinct EC-containing particle types. Our results show that biomass burning primarily produces EC-containing particles obviously coated with organic carbon (EC-OC) and organic nitrogen (EC-CN), with sizes concentrated between 0.4 and 1.0 μm. In contrast, bituminous coal emissions are dominated by sodium-rich EC-containing particles (EC-Na), while anthracite combustion predominantly produces particles coated with sulfate or nitrate (EC-NS). Bituminous coal particles are generally smaller ( < 0.4 μm), likely due to higher volatile content and rapid pyrolysis. The mixing states of EC-containing particles varied markedly. Sulfate (97HSO4−) was strongly associated with EC-OC and EC-Na particles, resulting in a highly mixing state. Levoglucosan (59C2H3O2−) showed distinct patterns between biomass and coal emissions.

 Tropical monsoons play a critical role in shaping regional and global climate systems, with profound ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, their long-term prediction remains challenging due to the complex interplay of regional dynamics, global climate drivers, large-scale teleconnections, and inherent non-stationarities in the climate system. Here, we introduce a unified network-based framework for predicting monsoon precipitation across diverse tropical regions. By leveraging global 2-meter air temperature fields, this approach captures large-scale climate teleconnections, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Rossby waves, enabling accurate forecasts for four key monsoon systems: the South American, East Asian, West African, and Indian monsoons. Our framework achieves remarkable forecasting accuracy with lead times of 4-10 months, outperforming traditional systems such as Seasonal Forecast System 5 and Climate Forecast System version 2. Beyond its predictive capabilities, the framework offers flexibility for application to other regions and climate phenomena, advancing our understanding of global climate dynamics. These findings have far-reaching implications for disaster preparedness, resource management, and sustainable development.

 Most oceans over the globe have experienced surface warming during the past century, but the subpolar Atlantic is quite otherwise. The sea surface temperature cooling trend to the south of Greenland, known as the North Atlantic Warming Hole, has raised debate over whether it is driven by the slowing of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Here we use observations as a benchmark and climate models as a tool to demonstrate that only models simulating a weakened historical Atlantic overturning can broadly reproduce the observed cooling and freshening in the warming hole region. This, in turn, indicates that the realistic Atlantic overturning slowed between 1900 and 2005, at a rate of −1.01 to −2.97 Sv century−1 (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1), according to a sea-surface-temperature-based fingerprint index estimate. Particularly, the Atlantic overturning slowdown causes an oceanic heat transport divergence across the subpolar North Atlantic, which, while partially offset by enhanced ocean heat uptake, results in cooling over the warming hole region.

 This study presents the first attempt to observe wildfire enhancements of carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) around sunrise and sunset from a hyperspectral infrared sounder in a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous orbit. The 2nd generation of High Spectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS-II) on board FengYun-3E (FY-3E), the world's first civilian dawn-dusk orbit meteorological satellite, provides global observations in the thermal infrared spectral range with equatorial overpass times of 5:30 am/pm local solar time (LST). The spectral observations are used to retrieve CO, formic acid (HCOOH) and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) emitted from three major Canadian wildfire events from June to August 2023. Extreme enhancements of CO, HCOOH and PAN were detected in the 2023 Canadian wildfires which are unprecedented in time and spatial scales and intensity. The HIRAS-II successfully captured the strong signals of CO, HCOOH, and PAN. The averaging kernel (AK) matrix, indicative of detection vertical sensitivity, peaks mostly in the free troposphere where extensive transport typically takes place. Comparison with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) reveals that the spatial distribution patterns of the total columns extracted from HIRAS-II are in good agreement. Validation with the CAMS model and ground-based observations from TCCON and NDACC confirms that HIRAS-II retrievals are consistent. The HCOOH-to-CO and the PAN-to-CO column enhancement ratios derived from HIRAS-II are close to those derived from IASI.

 Land elevation data are indispensable for topographic mapping and geological disaster monitoring. However, the existing ICESat-2/ATL08 (V04) product has a coarse resolution (≥100 m) and is characterized by high uncertainty in mountainous areas; thus, it cannot be used to describe terrain relief characteristics accurately. In this study, a new method for extracting terrain surface elevation is proposed, which uses a local statistical denoising algorithm for mountainous areas (LSDAMA) based on the raw georeferenced photon product ICESat-2/ATL03. Coarse denoising is based on performing histogram thresholding, and refined denoising is based on local slope fitting; the process of performing coarse denoising twice and then refined denoising not only improves the removal effect for noise photons but also increases the signal photon retention rate in mountainous areas. Additionally, the estimation accuracy of the terrain surface elevation can be improved by setting rectangular dynamic windows along the fitted slope direction. Using the Babao River Basin in the Qilian Mountains as the research area, a total of 137 validation points from 777 GPS CORS in 40 quadrats and UAV LiDAR measurements were used to verify the accuracy. The results showed that the terrain surface elevations estimated by the LSDAMA are more accurate than those estimated by the ATL08 official products, especially in mountainous areas with slopes greater than 20°. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the LSDAMA decreased from 2.72 m for the ATL08 product to 0.60 m, and the mean deviation (MBE) decreased from −1.27 to 0.04 m. Additionally, the LSDAMA greatly improved the signal photon retention rate and reduced the interval between adjacent elevation points from 100 m for the ATL08 product to 2–7 m; this reduced interval can be used to describe the terrain fluctuation characteristics in detail, thus providing reliable basic data for monitoring terrain surface elevation changes in mountainous areas."

 Identifying urban villages (UVs) is essential for supporting urban renewal and governance, as these informal areas present significant challenges to urban sustainability. Existing multi-modal deep-learning studies have accurately identified UVs in individual cities; however, their scalability is constrained by substantial computational demands and data availability. Currently, efficient deep-learning models tailored for large-scale, consistent UV maps using freely released Sentinel-2 data remain underexplored. Therefore, we proposed a flexible framework leveraging multiple Sentinel-2 observations and deep-learning models to cost-effectively support large-scale UV mapping. We specifically employed a dual-branch encoder to consolidate discriminative features: one branch extracted static information from annual images, while the other captured seasonal dynamics induced by building shadows across four seasonal images. These features were then jointly represented using fusion modules and used for UV identification through skip connections. The model was trained and tested on self-compiled Guangzhou-Shenzhen samples, with the Pearl River Delta serving to analyze applicability and transferability. Results demonstrated incorporating dynamic information notably enhanced the accuracy of UV identification. The proposed framework exhibited optimal performance (mIoU: 83.33 %) with robust spatial generalization, surpassing traditional methods (mIoU improvements: 0.46–12.49 %). Compared to multi-modal data-driven studies, our framework can be conveniently implemented in complex urban environments while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy in large-scale applications.

 Accurate building damage assessment is crucial for post-disaster response, yet existing methods struggle to capture complex spatial relationships and contextual features needed for distinguishing damage levels. To address this, we propose the Gated Adaptive Multi-scale Spatial-frequency Fusion Network (GAMSF), a two-phase framework for building localization and damage classification. GAMSF integrates three key innovations: (1) Adaptive Attention (AA) to dynamically prioritize critical regions, (2) Gated Multi-scale Feed-Forward Network (GMFFN) to enhance robustness by emphasizing prominent damage features, and (3) Multi-Scale Wavelet Fusion (MWF) to extract fine-grained structural details using wavelet transforms. Rigorous evaluations on the datasets, including xBD and xFBD, demonstrates that GAMSF achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with a 1.7% improvement in F1-score, a 2.1% gain in Kappa, and a 3.7% increase in minor damage identification accuracy compared to existing approaches.

 Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of irrigated cropland at the field scale is essential for managing irrigation water use and addressing the water-food nexus. While global and regional irrigation products exist, they often classify irrigated crops based on machine learning principles, where irrigated crops outperform rainfed ones. However, these methods typically lack mechanistic representation and are rarely applicable at the field scale over long time series. Additionally, identifying irrigated cropland in dual-season systems poses challenges due to temporal heterogeneity, leading to potential misclassification. To address these issues, we constructed a 3D canopy feature space including hydrothermal characteristics (1-precipitation/P, 2-actual evapotranspiration/AET) and spectral characteristic (3-NDVI). This approach is based on two mechanisms: the impact of irrigation on water vapor cycling and its role in promoting crop growth. We introduced a novel cross-region Slope Length Index (SLI) to map irrigated and rainfed crops at the field scale. Our method involved downscaling NDVI and AET using spectral fusion techniques (STF) on Google Earth Engine (GEE), followed by fitting a robust rainfed line (AET = −125.41 + 0.84 × P, R2 = 0.70) at the provincial scale, and calculating the SLI. Then A case of irrigation map (Irri_HNP) was generated by a threshold for crop water supply and demand, achieving ≥ 38 % accuracy improvement on overall accuracy (OA = 0.973) compared to existing products. The SLI method also exhibited strong stability when generalized to the national scope (AET = −74.41 + 0.82 × P, R2 = 0.73), maintaining robustness in both drought and humid years (AET = −177.08 + 0.82 × P, R2 = 0.69). The method’s scalability and transferability have been rigorously validated across diverse regions and environments, spanning from provincial to national scales. This validation achieved an OA of 0.922, demonstrating robust performance under heterogeneous conditions. Furthermore, the framework provides actionable insights for field-scale crop management and agricultural water governance."

 Vertical mixing of pollutants and secondary inorganic aerosol formations over Beijing, China are investigated based on an unique observational platform on the roof of a high building (528 m above ground) and stations near ground. The contrary trends in diurnal variations of pollutants (SO2, NOx etc.) between the 528 m layer and near ground confirm that pollutants are well mixed in the daytime, but strongly suppressed at night due to the decoupling of the residual layer (RL) and nocturnal stable boundary layer (SBL). The decoupling also results in differences of aerosol formations between the two layers due to the differences in gaseous precursors, atmospheric oxidation capacity, and meteorological variables. Observations indicate that sulfate formation is more efficient near ground than in the 528 m layer due to higher relative humidity (RH) near ground, while nocturnal nitrate formation is more efficient in the 528 m layer due to higher O3 in this layer. The formed nitrate in the RL is downwards transported to ground in next morning, highlighting the potential importance of vertical pollutants mixing and residual layer chemistry in air quality near ground."

 Elucidating the effects of anthropogenic pollutants on the formation mechanism of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is crucial for the improvement of atmospheric models toward the development of effective control strategies. It is extremely challenging to precisely clarify the impacts of concentrations of anthropogenic pollutants on the molecular compositions and particle number/mass concentrations of SOA under complicated conditions. Here, we report a series of the studies on the effects of anthropogenic pollutants (NO2 and SO2) on the photooxidation of a representative monoterpene, Δ3-carene, by using the scanning mobility particle sizer spectrometer, recently-developed vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser (VUV-FEL) photoionization aerosol mass spectrometry, and quantum chemical calculations. The results indicated that with the increase of NO2 concentration, the SOA yields increased under low-NO2 conditions but decreased under high-NO2 conditions. The OH radical was found to be the primary oxidant under low-NO2 conditions, whereas O3 became the dominant oxidant under high-NO2 conditions. SO2 substantially enhanced the formation of highly oxidized molecules via the acid-catalyzed pathway. A series of new compounds (i.e., organic peroxides, organic nitrates, and organosulfates) were observed and their formation mechanisms were proposed. The present findings highlight the critical role of anthropogenic pollutants in the photooxidation of monoterpene under low and high pollution environments and also open new avenues toward systematic studies of a broader class of volatile organic compounds."

 This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation and long-range transport characteristics of atmospheric speciated mercury (ASM) along the West and East Channels surrounding Taiwan Island toward the South China Sea (SCS) in East Asia. Field sampling was conducted at three remote island sites, and potential sources of ASM were examined using backward trajectory clustering and regional fire maps. Seasonally, ASM concentrations followed the order: spring > winter > fall > summer, with higher ASM levels observed in the western waters of Taiwan Island than those in the eastern waters. Among the mercury species, gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) was predominant, and followed by particulate-bound mercury (PBM) and gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), with total gaseous mercury (TGM = GEM+GOM) accounting for 92.1–98.4 % of ASM. Clustered trajectory analysis indicated that Asian Northeastern Monsoons (ANMs) may transport ASMs originating from continental sources in North and East Asia to the island sites via long-range transport. Slash-and-burn activities in the Indochina Peninsula and mainland China during spring and winter contributed to elevated ASM levels. The West Channel exhibited a pronounced “channel effect,” amplifying industrial emissions across the Taiwan Strait and resulting in higher ASM levels at the Penghu Islands. Conversely, the East Channel received diluted air masses through long-range transport from the Korean Peninsula and North China via Green Island and the Bashi Channel, leading to relatively lower ASM levels at the Dongsha Island. Overall, this study highlights the importance of seasonal circulation patterns and regional combustion sources in shaping mercury distribution in the marine boundary layer of East Asia."

 The Western Tibetan Vortex (WTV) is a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern recognized from monthly data. It has a quasi-barotropic structure, with its center located over the western Tibetan Plateau (TP) and provides the leading mode of variability of the western TP atmospheric circulation. However, existing research on the WTV mainly focuses on its interannual and seasonal variability, lacking detailed examination of synoptic scale processes. We utilize the daily ERA-Interim reanalysis to assess the intrinsic timescale of WTV activity, and the lifecycle of WTV events, at the synoptic scale.We find that the temporal evolution of the WTV at the synoptic scale can be interpreted as a red-noise (First-order Markov) process with an e-folding timescale ranging from 4.6 to 6.9 days, with a relatively longer duration in spring and summer and shorter duration during autumn and winter. The composite lifecycle of synoptic WTV events is characterized by a three-center wave train-like pattern across Eurasia (Scandinavia-West Siberia-western TP) during the developing and peak phases, while transitioning to a two-center dipole pattern (West Siberia-western TP) during the dissipating phase. During the developing and peak phases, intensity changes propagate eastward, accompanied by the eastward movement of nearly all three centers. In contrast, during the dissipating phase, the intensity of the two centers shows minimal propagation, with the West Siberia center shifting westward in position. Our results indicate that wave activity may differ between the developing-peak stages and the dissipation stage. This provides a foundation for further exploration on the dynamical characteristics of the WTV."

We investigated how this coupling is achieved in a bacterial phytochrome variant, Agp2-PAiRFP2. Contrary to classical protein crystallography, which only allows probing (cryo-trapped) stable states, we have used time-resolved serial femtosecond x-ray crystallography (tr-SFX) and pump-probe techniques with various illumination and delay times with respect to photoexcitation of the parent Pfr state. Thus, structural data for seven time frames were sorted into groups of molecular events along the reaction coordinate. They range from chromophore isomerization to the formation of Meta-F, the intermediate that precedes the functional relevant secondary structure transition of the tongue. Structural data for the early events were used to calculate the photoisomerization pathway to complement the experimental data. Late events allow identifying the molecular switch that is linked to the intramolecular proton transfer as a prerequisite for the following structural transitions."

Using a mouse gambling task with a reinforcement-learning model, we described individual decision-making profiles as a combination of three archetypal strategies: Optimizers, Risk-averse, and Explorers. These strategies reflected stable differences in the parameters generating decisions (sensitivity to the reward magnitude, to risk, or to punishment) derived from a reinforcement-learning model of animal choice. Chemogenetic manipulation showed that dorsomedial striatum (DMS) neurons substantially affect decision-making, while the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum neurons (DLS) have lesser or no effects, respectively. Specifically, DMS dSPNs decrease risk aversion by increasing the perceived value of risky choices, while DMS iSPNs emphasize large gains, affecting decisions depending on decision-making profiles.

While the m6A demethylases FTO and ALKBH5 are recognized for their crucial roles in various cancers, their impact on lymphoid leukemia remains uncertain. Using T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model system, we identify FTO as a unique vulnerability in T cell leukemia. Knockout ofFTO, but notALKBH5, significantly suppresses leukemia initiation and progression. Mechanistic analysis reveals that FTO heightensELK3mRNA stability in an m6A-dependent manner. Elevated ELK3 in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of glycolytic genes. Pharmacological inhibition of FTO suppressesELK3expression, hampers glycolysis and manifests remarkable antileukemia efficacy.

We also show how the cytosolic proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 cooperate to regulate recruitment of reserve pool vesicles during sustained firing to maintain transmission, as well as the potential of selective vesicle active zone tethering to ensure rapid vesicle replenishment while minimizing reserve pool recruitment.

Here, we show that hair follicle SCs (HF-SCs) sense mechanical forces through cell adhesion and maintain quiescence in a PIEZO1-dependent mechanism. PIEZO1 interacts with E-cadherin in HF-SCs, and mechanical pulling of E-cadherin with a force of ~20 pN triggers PIEZO1-dependent, localized calcium flickers. Deletion ofPiezo1leads to reduced cumulative calcium influx and compromises quiescence. Single-cell genomic analyses identify a transcriptional network involving AP1 and NFATC1, which functions downstream of PIEZO1 and regulates the expression of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton genes to reinforce the unique mechanical property of HF-SCs. These findings establish the force threshold necessary for PIEZO1 activation and reveal PIEZO1-dependent calcium influx as a key mechanism for sensing mechanical cues in the niche and regulating HF-SC activity."

However, prolonged use is associated with severe hematologic toxicity, the underlying mechanisms of which remain incompletely understood, particularly regarding the role of linezolid metabolites. Our clinical study indicates that elevated exposure to PNU142586, a primary metabolite of linezolid, is associated with an increased risk of linezolid-induced toxicity, even in the absence of renal impairment. To elucidate its mechanism, we identify DNA topoisomerase 2-α (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-β (TOP2B) as primary targets of PNU142586 at molecular, cellular, and in vivo levels. PNU142586 disrupts replication and transcription by impeding DNA binding to TOP2A and TOP2B with a favorable conformation for cleavage and by inhibiting adenosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis, ultimately leading to antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study thus provides mechanistic insight into linezolid-induced hematologic toxicity and offers a foundation for safer antibiotic development and improved clinical monitoring through biomarker identification."

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter plays a key role in coordinating metabolic homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial metabolic pathways and calcium signaling. However, a comprehensive analysis of uniporter-regulated mitochondrial pathways has remained unexplored. Here, we investigate consequences of uniporter loss and gain of function using uniporter knockout cells and fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), which we demonstrate to have elevated mitochondrial calcium levels. We find that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism and the urea cycle are uniporter-regulated pathways. Reduced uniporter function boosts expression of BCAA catabolism genes and the urea cycle enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase. In contrast, high uniporter activity in FLC suppresses their expression. This suppression is mediated by the transcription factor KLF15, a master regulator of liver metabolism. Thus, the uniporter plays a central role in FLC-associated metabolic changes, including hyperammonemia. Our study identifies an important role for the uniporter in metabolic adaptation through transcriptional regulation of metabolism and elucidates its importance for BCAA and ammonia metabolism."

In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlates with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature, an increase in microglia proximity to Aß plaques and phagocytosis of both Aß and small plaques. PHD3 deficiency mitigated the Aß plaque–associated neuropathology and rescued behavioral deficits of an AD mouse model. Last, we demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression in the absence of Aß pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and behavioral alterations. Together, our data strongly indicate that the inactivation of the PHD3-FOXO3 axis controls the microglial IFNS in a cell autonomous manner, improving AD outcome."

Here, we present a transient expression protocol that produces robust mouse NaV1.9 currents, enabling direct electrophysiological comparisons with native dorsal root ganglion neurons. To further understand the low current density observed in human NaV1.9, we created chimeras with NaV1.5 and identified a role for the C-tail—specifically the IQ motif and EF-hand—in regulating current densities, likely due to a weak affinity for calmodulin. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated that, unlike other NaVchannel subtypes, calmodulin binding to the C-tail is likely too weak to occur under physiological conditions. Markedly, the pre-IQ region did not influence channel expression but was responsible for conferring the characteristic depolarized voltage dependency of inactivation of NaV1.9. Our findings provide insights into the unique gating mechanisms of NaV1.9 and demonstrate the robustness of this platform for structure-function studies."
10.1126/sciadv.adt1538,True,Science Advances,该研究论文通过火星大气与挥发演化探测器（MAVEN）的数据，直接观测到了火星大气中发生的溅射现象。论文分析了氩气密度与太阳电场之间的关系，发现溅射速率远高于模型预测，并提供了太阳风暴期间溅射增强的证据。这项研究对于理解火星大气流失机制以及早期火星表面液态水存在条件至关重要，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析方面。,"['atmospheric composition', 'upper atmosphere', 'argon density', 'solar wind interaction', 'MAVEN satellite observations', 'atmospheric escape', 'atmospheric sputtering']",Shannon M. Curry;Takuya Hara;Janet G. Luhmann;Francois Leblanc;Rebecca Jolitz;David Mitchell;Ronan Modolo;David A. Brain;Jared Espley;Mehdi Benna;Jasper Halekas,First direct observations of atmospheric sputtering at Mars,"Billions of years ago, Mars’ ability to sustain liquid water waned as the solar wind and radiation began to erode the atmosphere. Sputtering is an atmospheric escape process that may have been dominant during earlier epochs of our Sun according to isotopic evidence, but is difficult to detect under current solar conditions. Using over 9 years of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, we present the first observations of present-day sputtering in the martian upper atmosphere. By correlating argon densities with solar electric fields, we find that sputtered rates of argon are over four times higher than model predictions. We also present evidence of enhanced sputtering during a solar storm, offering a glimpse at more intense conditions in the early solar system. Observationally establishing the role of sputtering in the loss of Mars’ atmosphere is critical to understanding the conditions that allowed liquid water to exist on the martian surface and the implications for habitability."
10.1126/sciadv.adq2348,False,Science Advances,该研究论文主要关注的是汽油车尾气排放对空气质量的影响以及尾气排放物在光化学老化后产生的毒性。虽然涉及到了空气质量问题（PM2.5），但其重点在于研究尾气成分变化对人体细胞的毒性影响，而非使用遥感技术监测大气环境。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析等）的关联性不强。,"['PM2.5', 'air quality', 'photochemical aging', 'secondary aerosols', 'DNA damage', 'oxidative stress']",Mathilde N.

Exhaust emission standards, forcing improvements in combustion and exhaust after-treatment technology, considerably decreases combustion-related PM2.5emitted by modern cars. A549 cancerous alveolar and BEAS-2B normal bronchial epithelial cells were exposed at the air-liquid interface to the total aerosol or gas phase of either fresh or photochemically aged tailpipe emissions from a gasoline EURO 6d car equipped with a gasoline particulate filter. Diluted fresh emissions contained particle number concentrations comparable to low ambient air levels and induced no detectable cytotoxicity. Photochemical aging led to the formation of secondary aerosols and caused significant cytotoxicity. While the aged aerosol induced significant DNA damage, oxidative stress was more associated with volatile secondary species. Our results call for the consideration of the exhaust emission atmospheric transformation processes in future emission standards toward health effect-driven emission regulations."
10.1126/sciadv.ads4507,False,Science Advances,该论文主要研究一种水下软体机器人，它由不具备光机械响应的聚合物制成，但可以通过环境流体驱动，实现精确的三维运动和多种运动模式。这种机器人具有坚韧的特性，能够在水下隧道中自由穿梭，并实现光导运动。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Guodong Hou;Xuning Wang;Feiyu Zhang;Wei Lu;Xin Chen;Tiannan Yang;Guang Meng;Xiaoshi Qian,"A photo-mechanically inactive tough gel exhibits multimodal, light-guided underwater navigation","Soft robots exhibit flexural and active features that enabled their potential deployment in applications where rigid systems could not perform well. However, the locomotion of the soft robots still largely relies on the paddling that requires variety of active materials as artificial muscles. Hence, extreme conditions, i.e., under compressive or tensile loads, can cause irreversible damages that disable the actuation. Here, we report a tough underwater robot that exhibits an accurate, three-dimensional, and multimodal motion. Counterintuitively, the soft robot is composed of polymers that are not photo-mechanically responsive but are powered by the ambient fluid. The unique feature notably widens the pool of material selection and allows further treatment to strengthen the polymer matrix without concerns of trade-off between the mechanical properties with the actuation capability. The tough, photo-inactive gel maneuvers precisely, traveling effortlessly in and out of the tunnels, and enables versatile phototactic locomotion."
