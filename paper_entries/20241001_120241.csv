Barbosa,Pre-launch calibration and validation of the Airborne Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP) instrument,"The Airborne Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP) is a new Earth-observing instrument that provides highly accurate measurements of the atmosphere and surface. Using a physics-based calibration technique, we show that AirHARP achieves high measurement accuracy in laboratory and field environments and exceeds a benchmark accuracy requirement for modern aerosol and cloud climate observations. Therefore, the HARP design is highly attractive for upcoming NASA climate missions. 
 The Airborne Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP) is a new imaging polarimeter instrument capable of sampling a single Earth target from up to 120 viewing angles, in four spectral channels, and in three linear polarization states across a 114° field of view (FOV). AirHARP is telecentric in the image space and simultaneously images three linear polarization states with no moving parts. These two aspects of the design allow for a simple and efficient quantitative calibration. Using coefficients derived at the center of the lens and the detector flatfields, we can calibrate the entire AirHARP sensor in a variety of laboratory, field, and space environments. We show that this telecentric calibration technique yields a 1σ absolute uncertainty of 0.25 % in degree of linear polarization (DOLP) in the laboratory for all channels and for pixels around the optical axis. To validate across the FOV, we compare our multi-angle reflectance and polarization data with the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) over targets sampled during the NASA Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) campaign. We use the error-normalized difference technique to estimate how well the instruments compare relative to their error models. We find that AirHARP and the RSP reasonably agree for reflectance and DOLP within 2 standard deviations of their mutual uncertainty at 550, 670, and 870 nm and over a limited set of ocean and desert scenes. This calibration technique makes the Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP) design attractive for new spaceborne climate missions: HARP CubeSat (2020–2022), HARP2 (2024–) on the NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE), and beyond."
10.5194/amt-17-5731-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了利用机载快速臭氧仪器测量臭氧通量，以研究臭氧在海洋表面和云层中的沉降过程。研究发现，云层下方的臭氧通量始终指向云层，而海洋表面的臭氧通量则较小且空间变化较大。这表明云层可能是臭氧的重要汇，而海洋表面的臭氧沉降过程受到多种因素的影响，例如卤素、溶解有机碳和硫等。论文还比较了不同机载臭氧仪器的性能，并证明了它们能够准确测量臭氧通量。这项研究为理解海洋和云层对大气臭氧的影响提供了新的见解，并为大气环境遥感技术提供了新的应用方向。,"['airborne ozone instruments', 'eddy covariance fluxes', 'ozone deposition', 'ocean surface', 'cloud processing', 'atmospheric composition']",Randall Chiu;Florian Obersteiner;Alessandro Franchin;Teresa Campos;Adriana Bailey;Christopher Webster;Andreas Zahn;Rainer Volkamer,Intercomparison of fast airborne ozone instruments to measure eddy covariance fluxes: spatial variability in deposition at the ocean surface and evidence for cloud processing,"The ozone sink into oceans and marine clouds is seldom studied and highly uncertain. Calculations suggest O3 destruction at aqueous surfaces (ocean, droplets) may be strongly accelerated, but field evidence is missing. Here we compare three fast airborne O3 instruments to measure eddy covariance fluxes of O3 over the remote ocean, in clear and cloudy air. We find O3 fluxes below clouds are consistently directed into clouds, while O3 fluxes into oceans are much smaller and spatially variable. 
 The air–sea exchange of ozone (O3) is controlled by chemistry involving halogens, dissolved organic carbon, and sulfur in the sea surface microlayer. Calculations also indicate faster ozone photolysis at aqueous surfaces, but the role of clouds as an ozone sink is currently not well established. Fast-response ozone sensors offer opportunities to measure eddy covariance (EC) ozone fluxes in the marine boundary layer. However, intercomparisons of fast airborne O3 sensors and EC O3 fluxes measured on aircraft have not been conducted before. In April 2022, the Technological Innovation Into Iodine and GV Environmental Research (TI3GER) field campaign deployed three fast ozone sensors (gas chemiluminescence and a combination of UV absorption with coumarin chemiluminescence detection, CID) together with a fast water vapor sensor and anemometer to study iodine chemistry in the troposphere and stratosphere over Colorado and over the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii and Alaska. Here, we present an instrument comparison between the NCAR Fast O3 instrument (FO3, gas-phase CID) and two KIT Fast AIRborne Ozone instruments (FAIRO, UV absorption and coumarin CID). The sensors have comparable precision < 0.4 % Hz−0.5 (0.15 ppbv Hz−0.5), and ozone volume mixing ratios (VMRs) generally agreed within 2 % over a wide range of environmental conditions: 10 < O3 < 1000 ppbv, below detection < NOx < 7 ppbv, and 2 ppmv < H2O < 4 % VMR. Both instrument designs are demonstrated to be suitable for EC flux measurements and were able to detect O3 fluxes with exchange velocities (defined as positive for upward) as slow as −0.010 ± 0.004 cm s−1, which is in the lower range of previously reported measurements. Additionally, we present two case studies. In one, the direction of ozone and water vapor fluxes was reversed (vO3 = +0.134 ± 0.005 cm s−1), suggesting that overhead evaporating clouds could be a strong ozone sink. Further work is needed to better understand the role of clouds as a possibly widespread sink of ozone in the remote marine boundary layer. In the second case study, vO3 values are negative (varying by a factor of 6–10 from −0.036 ± 0.006 to −0.003 ± 0.004 cm s−1), while the water vapor fluxes are consistently positive due to evaporation from the ocean surface and spatially homogeneous. This case study demonstrates that the processes governing ozone and water vapor fluxes can become decoupled and illustrates the need to elucidate possible drivers (physical, chemical, or biological) of the variability in ozone exchange velocities on fine spatial scales (∼ 20 km) over remote oceans."

It employs machine learning to correct the AOD-to-PM2.5 conversion ratio using various data sources. The approach produces high-resolution PM2.5 estimates with improved accuracy. The method is flexible and can incorporate additional training data from different sources, making it a valuable tool for air quality monitoring and epidemiological studies. 
 Estimates of PM2.5 levels are crucial for monitoring air quality and studying the epidemiological impact of air quality on the population. Currently, the most precise measurements of PM2.5 are obtained from ground stations, resulting in limited spatial coverage. In this study, we consider satellite-based PM2.5 retrieval, which involves conversion of high-resolution satellite retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) into high-resolution PM2.5 retrieval. To improve the accuracy of the AOD-to-PM2.5 conversion, we employ the machine-learning-based post-process correction to correct the AOD-to-PM conversion ratio derived from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis model data. The post-process-correction approach utilizes a fusion and downscaling of satellite observation and retrieval data, MERRA-2 reanalysis data, various high-resolution geographical indicators, meteorological data, and ground station observations for learning a predictor for the approximation error in the AOD-to-PM2.5 conversion ratio. The corrected conversion ratio is then applied to estimate PM2.5 levels given the high-resolution satellite AOD retrieval data derived from Sentinel-3 observations. The region of study is central Europe during the year 2019. Our model produces PM2.5 estimates with a spatial resolution of 100 m at satellite overpass times with R2 = 0.55 and RMSE = 6.2 µg m−3. The corresponding metrics for monthly averages are R2 = 0.72 and RMSE = 3.7 µg m−3. Additionally, we have incorporated an ensemble of neural networks to provide error envelopes for machine-learning-related uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates. The proposed approach can produce accurate high-resolution PM2.5 data that can be very useful for air quality monitoring, emission regulation,  and epidemiological studies."

The average classification accuracy on the validation set exceeded 85 %, and the R² values for linear fitting with existing statistical data all surpassed 0.9, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed mapping method. 
 In recent years, the demand for rice in Africa has been growing rapidly, and in order to meet this demand, the rice cultivation area is also expanding rapidly, thus it is of great significance to monitor the rice cultivation in Africa. The spatial and temporal distribution of rice cultivation in Africa is complex, making it difficult to use a climate-based rice identification method, and the existing rice distribution products are all grid based statistical data with low resolution, unable to obtain accurate rice field location and available labels. To address these two difficulties, based on time-series optical and dual-polarisation SAR data, this study proposes a sample set construction method by fast coarse positioning assisted visual interpretation, and a feature importance guided supervised classification combining multiple temporal optical and SAR features to reduce the impact of rice diversity in Africa. Firstly, we use the time-series statistical features of VH data for fast coarse positioning and screening of possible rice areas, and combine multiple auxiliary data for visual interpretation to make sample set; secondly, based on the complementary information in SAR data and optical data, the 20 meter Africa rice distribution map of 2023 was completed by combining the object-oriented segmentation results of temporal optical images and the pixel based classification results of temporal SAR data features after feature selection. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method on the validation set is more than 85 %, and the R2 of the linear fit to various existing statistical data is more than 0.9, which proves that the proposed method can achieve the spatial distribution mapping of rice under the complex climatic conditions in a large region, providing crucial data support for rice monitoring and agricultural policy development.

Our dataset meticulously documents 36 attributes of DFBDs, and we have utilized Google Earth for validation. Additionally, we discussed the applicability of landslide dam stability and peak discharge models to DFBDs. This dataset offers a rich foundation of data for future studies on DFBDs. 
 Debris flows, as a special kind of landslides, often block rivers to form barrier dams and trigger a series of disasters such as upstream aggradation and outburst floods. The understanding of debris-flow barrier dams (DFBDs) is poor, mostly due to existing researches focusing on individual events and a lack of summarization of multiple DFBD events. The existing global or regional datasets of landslide barrier dams (LDs) contain only a few cases of DFBDs, and ignore the differences between DFBDs and other landslide barrier dams (LDs), such as the dams of rock slide, debris avalanche, or earth slide. To fill this gap, we reviewed 2519 literatures and media reports with high quality. Focusing on identified debris-flow damming events, a rigorous data review and validation process was conducted using Google Earth. A systematic approach was employed to prioritize conflicting information from various data sources. Consequently, a global dataset was compiled, encompassing 555 historical DFBDs from 1800 to 2023."

Streambed sediment, surface water, and private well water samples were collected 128 and 276 days postaccident to assess the natural attenuation potential of VC and BA by quantifying biodegradation biomarker genes and conducting microcosm treatability studies. qPCR detected the aerobic VC degradation biomarkers etnC in ∼40% and etnE in ∼27% of sediments collected in both sampling campaigns in abundances reaching 105 gene copies g–1. The 16S rRNA genes of organohalide-respiring Dehalococcoides and Dehalogenimonas were, respectively, detected in 50 and 64% of sediment samples collected 128 days postaccident and in 63 and 88% of sediment samples collected 276 days postaccident, in abundances reaching 107 cells g–1. Elevated detection frequencies of VC degradation biomarker genes were measured immediately downstream of the accident site (i.e., Sulphur Run). Aerobic VC degradation occurred in all sediment microcosms and coincided with increases of etnC/etnE genes and Mycobacterium, a genus comprising aerobic VC degraders. The conversion of VC to ethene and an increased abundance of VC reductive dechlorination biomarker genes were observed in microcosms established with sediments collected from Sulphur Run. All anoxic microcosms rapidly degraded BA to innocuous products with  intermediate formation of n-butanol and acrylate. The results indicate that microbiomes in the East Palestine watershed have natural attenuation capacity for VC and BA. Recommendations are made to improve first-response actions in future contaminant release accidents of this magnitude."

This study investigated the in vitro toxicological characteristics of PM2.5 emissions from residential biomass pellet burning using the A549 epithelial cell line. The potential of modern pellet applications to reduce PM2.5 emissions was evaluated by considering both mass reduction and toxicity modification. PM2.5 emissions from raw and pelletized biomass combustion reduced cell viability, indicative of acute toxicity, and also protein expression associated with epithelial barrier integrity, implying further systemic toxicity, potentially via an oxidative stress mechanism. Toxicity varied between PM2.5 emissions from raw biomass and pellets, with pelletized straw and wood inducing cytotoxicity by factors of 0.54 and 1.30, and causing epithelial barrier damage by factors of 1.76 and 2.08, respectively, compared to their raw counterparts. Factoring in both mass reduction and toxicity modifications, PM2.5 emissions from pelletized straw and wood dropped to 1.83 and 5.07 g/kg, respectively, from 30.1 to 9.32 g/kg for raw biomass combustion. This study underscores the effectiveness of pelletized biomass, particularly straw pellets, as a sustainable alternative to traditional biofuels and highlights the necessity of considering changes in toxicity when assessing the potential of clean fuels to mitigate emissions of the PM2.5 complex."

In the urban water system, the increased disinfectant usage gives more chances for undesirable disinfection-resistant bacteria. As the strongest oxidative disinfectant in large-scale water treatment, ozone might select ozone-resistant bacteria (ORB), which, however, have rarely been reported and are inexplicit for their resistant mechanisms and physiological characteristics. In this study, six strains of ORB were screened from a water reclamation plant in Beijing. Three of them (O7, CR19, and O4) were more resistant to ozone than all previously reported ORB or even spores. The ozone consumption capacity of extracellular polymeric substances and cell walls was proved to be the main sources of bacterial ozone resistance, rather than intracellular antioxidant enzymes. The transcriptome results elucidated that strong ORB possessed a combined antioxidant mechanism consisting of the enhanced transcription of protein synthesis, protein export, and polysaccharide export genes (LptF, LptB, NodJ, LivK, LviG, MetQ, MetN, and GltU).

These wells, a result of over a century of fossil fuel extraction without adequate regulation, lack basic information like location and depth, emit greenhouse gases, and leak toxic substances into groundwater. For most of these wells, basic information such as well location and depth is unknown or unverified. Addressing this issue necessitates innovative and interdisciplinary approaches for locating, characterizing, and mitigating their environmental impacts. Our survey of the United States revealed the need for tools to identify well locations and assess conditions, prompting the development of technologies including machine learning to automatically extract information from old records (95%+ accuracy), remote sensing technologies like aero-magnetometers to find buried wells, and cost-effective methods for estimating methane emissions. Notably, fixed-wing drones equipped with magnetometers have emerged as cost-effective and efficient for discovering unknown wells, offering advantages over helicopters and quadcopters. Efforts also involved leveraging local knowledge through outreach to state and tribal governments as well as citizen science initiatives.

It is unclear how combinations of different low‐frequency internal climate modes influence Arctic amplification on the decadal timescale. Here, the decadal Arctic SAT variation, its connection with the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and possible underlying mechanisms, are investigated based on several independent observational proxies, pre‐industrial experiments, and historical large ensembles of two CMIP6 models. Our study suggests that AMOC and Arctic SAT vary in phase on the decadal timescale, whereas this relationship is insignificant at the interannual timescale. Further analysis shows that the AMOC accompanied with cross‐basin oceanic water/heat transport between Atlantic and Arctic would alter air–sea interface exchange over the melting ice regions, and then amplified poleward atmospheric heat and moisture transports. The resulting enhanced downward longwave radiation ultimately warms the Arctic SAT. Additionally, the decadal‐scale North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) can modulate the relationship between AMOC and Arctic SAT by influencing poleward moisture transport and cross‐basin circulation. Specifically, the phase shift of combined NPO and AMOC can contribute 14%–41% covariance relationship between AMOC and Arctic SAT. Our study provides potential sources for predicting the Arctic climate and constraining its uncertainty in future projections."

While earlier research has uncovered significant point‐source methane emissions from O&G production in the US and Canada, which are key regions with large methane emissions, a comprehensive post‐COVID‐19 survey has been notably absent. Here, we perform a detailed survey of methane super‐emitters across multiple basins of North America (Marcellus Shale, Haynesville/Bossier Shale, Permian Basin and Montney Shale) using the new Chinese Gaofen5‐01A/02 (GF5‐01A/02) satellite measurements during 2022–2023. We detect 139 individual methane plumes emanating from 122 point sources, with flux rates ranging from 519 to 16,071 kg hr−1. These emissions exhibit a highly skewed and heavy‐tailed distribution, constituting approximately 23% of the flux inversion with TROPOMI in the sample region, with a range of 13%–40%. Moreover, we observe a 66.7% reduction in methane emissions in Permian Basin during COVID‐19, followed by fluctuations until spring 2023. By summer 2023, methane emissions rebound to twice their previous magnitude (1.68 ± 0.58 Tg a−1). Using these point‐source surveys, we further quantify a regional methane emission of 2.69 ± 0.86 Tg a−1 in Permian Basin. This estimation closely aligns with top‐down inversions (2.22 ± 0.40 Tg a−1) from TROPOMI. The upscale estimation underscores the effectiveness of high‐resolution remote sensing measurements in improving bottom‐up emissions inventories and refining regional methane emission assessments. Our results highlight the potential climate benefits derived from regular monitoring and specific remediation efforts focused on relatively few strong point‐source emissions."

Di Girolamo,Do Subsampling Strategies Reduce the Confounding Effect of Errors in Bispectral Retrievals on Estimates of Aerosol Cloud Interactions?,"Bi‐spectral retrievals of droplet effective radius and cloud optical depth are widely utilized to estimate aerosol cloud interactions (ACI) in warm clouds in the marine boundary layer. Here, we assess the effect of retrieval errors due to the neglect of 3D radiative transfer during the retrieval process on this analysis of ACI. We use an ensemble of stochastically‐modeled cloud fields and 3D radiative transfer simulations to study the retrieval errors at a solar zenith angle of 30°. Simulated retrieval biases in droplet number concentration (Nd) for all three MODIS channels vary systematically from +35% to −80% as cloud heterogeneity increases. Pixel‐level errors can be much larger. Commonly utilized subsampling strategies do not reduce the systematic variation in retrieval error. Negative error correlations between optical depth and droplet effective radius produce spuriously negative slopes between the logarithm of liquid water path and Nd (−1.0 to −0.3). Pixels at the center of (8 km)2 patches that are not overcast have a relative bias in Nd of −50%. The relative frequency of these biased pixels varies linearly with the clear fraction in MODIS data and form the basis for a simple parameterization of Nd bias that varies with cloud fraction (CF). Using this parameterization, synthetic data experiments indicate that estimates of the first indirect effect in the tropical ocean can be overestimated by up to 30%, and the effect of aerosol on CF is overestimated by 50%, due to neglecting the correlation between retrieval errors and cloud microphysics."

This complexity requires WBGT to be calculated iteratively following the recommended approach developed by Liljegren and colleagues. The need for iteration has limited the wide application of Liljegren's approach, and stimulated various simplified WBGT approximations that do not require iteration but are potentially seriously biased. By carefully examining the self‐nonlinearities in Liljegren's model, we develop a zero‐iteration analytic approximation of WBGT while maintaining sufficient accuracy and the physical basis of the original model. The new approximation slightly deviates from Liljegren's full model—by less than 1°C in 99% cases over 93% of global land area. The annual mean and 75%–99% percentiles of WBGT are also well represented with biases within ±0.5 $\pm 0.5$°C globally. This approximation is clearly more accurate than other commonly used WBGT approximations. Physical intuition can be developed on the processes controlling WBGT variations from an energy balance perspective. This may provide a basis for applying WBGT to understanding the physical control of heat stress."

 The Himalayas, which host glaciers, modulate the Indian Monsoon and create an arid Tibetan Plateau, play a vital role in distributing freshwater resources to the world’s most populous regions. The Himalayas formed under prolonged crustal thickening and erosion by glaciers and rivers. Chomolungma (8,849 m)—also known as Mount Everest or Sagarmāthā—is higher than surrounding peaks, and GPS measurements suggest a higher uplift rate in recent years than the long-term trend. Here we analyse the potential contribution of a river capture event in the Kosi River drainage basin on the renewed surface uplift of Chomolungma. We numerically reconstruct the capture process using a simple stream power model combined with nonlinear inverse methods constrained by modern river profiles. Our best-fit model suggests the capture event occurred approximately 89 thousand years ago and caused acceleration of downstream incision rates. Flexural models estimate this non-steady erosion triggers isostatic response and surface uplift over a broad geographical area. We suggest that part of Chomolungma’s anomalous elevation (~15–50 m) can be explained as the isostatic response to capture-triggered river incision, highlighting the complex interplay between geological dynamics and the formation of topographic features.

 In the event of insufficient mitigation efforts, net-negative CO2 emissions may be required to return climate warming to acceptable limits as defined by the Paris Agreement. The ocean acts as an important carbon sink under increasing atmospheric CO2 levels when the physico-chemical uptake of carbon dominates. However, the processes that govern the marine carbon sink under net-negative CO2 emission regimes are unclear. Here we assessed changes in marine CO2 uptake and storage mechanisms under a range of idealized temperature-overshoot scenarios using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity over centennial timescales. We show that while the fate of CO2 from physico-chemical uptake is very sensitive to future atmospheric boundary conditions and CO2 is partly lost from the ocean at times of net-negative CO2 emissions, storage associated with the biological carbon pump continues to increase and may even dominate marine excess CO2 storage on multi-centennial timescales. Our findings imply that excess carbon that is attributable to the biological carbon pump needs to be considered carefully when quantifying and projecting changes in the marine carbon sink.

 Dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that has been associated with an imbalance towards the direct pathway between striatum and internal pallidum, but the neuronal underpinnings of this abnormal basal ganglia pathway activity remain unknown. Here, we report invasive recordings from ten dystonia patients via deep brain stimulation electrodes that allow for parallel recordings of several basal ganglia nuclei, namely the striatum, external and internal pallidum, that all displayed activity in the low frequency band (3–12 Hz). In addition to a correlation with low-frequency activity in the internal pallidum (R = 0.88, P = 0.001), we demonstrate that dystonic symptoms correlate specifically with low-frequency coupling between striatum and internal pallidum (R = 0.75, P = 0.009). This points towards a pathophysiological role of the direct striato-pallidal pathway in dystonia that is conveyed via coupling in the enhanced low-frequency band. Our study provides a mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of dystonia by revealing a link between symptom severity and frequency-specific coupling of distinct basal ganglia pathways.

 Methods are lacking that can prepare deuterium-enriched building blocks, in the full range of deuterium substitution patterns at the isotopic purity levels demanded by pharmaceutical use. To that end, this work explores the regio- and stereoselective deuteration of tetrahydropyridine (THP), which is an attractive target for study due to the wide prevalence of piperidines in drugs. A series of d0–d8 tetrahydropyridine isotopomers were synthesized by the stepwise treatment of a tungsten-complexed pyridinium salt with H−/D− and H+/D+. The resulting decomplexed THP isotopomers and isotopologues were analyzed via molecular rotational resonance (MRR) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique that distinguishes isotopomers and isotopologues by their unique moments of inertia.

 The last decade has seen significant improvements in our understanding of skyrmions current induced dynamics, along with their room temperature stabilization, however, the impact of local material inhomogeneities still remains an issue that impedes reaching the regime of steady state motion of these spin textures. Here, we study the spin-torque driven motion of skyrmions in synthetic ferrimagnetic multilayers with the aim of achieving high mobility and reduced skyrmion Hall effect. We consider Pt|Co|Tb multilayers of various thicknesses with antiferromagnetic coupling between the Co and Tb magnetization. The increase of Tb thickness in the multilayers reduces the total magnetic moment and increases the spin-orbit torques allowing to reach velocities up to 400 ms−1 for skyrmions with diameters of about 160 nm. We demonstrate that due to reduced skyrmion Hall effect combined with the edge repulsion of the magnetic track, the skyrmions move along the track without any transverse deflection. Further, by comparing the field-induced domain wall motion and current-induced skyrmion motion, we demonstrate that the skyrmions at the largest current densities present all the characteristics of a dynamical flow regime.

 Multi-year La Niña events cause prolonged climate disruptions worldwide, but a systematic understanding of the underlying mechanisms is not yet established. Here we show using observations and models from the sixth phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project that a greater frequency of consecutive La Niña events is tied to the upper equatorial Pacific Ocean when it favors more rapid heat discharge. The propensity for heat discharge is underscored by negative skewness in upper-ocean heat content, underpinned by southward tropical Pacific wind shift during austral summer. Models with stronger westerly anomalies south of the equator simulate steeper east-to-west upward tilt of the thermocline that is favorable for a greater discharge rate. This highlights the crucial role of the southward wind shift in the nonlinear system of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.

Specifically, we found that by the end of the 21st century, the modulations of combined Pacific El Niño and positive Pacific Meridional Mode on magnified heat-dome-like circulations would be translated into summertime hotspots over western Asia and western North America. Amplified soil moisture–temperature couplings then further aggravate the heatwave intensity over these two hotspots.

 Weather forecasting is crucial for scientific research and society. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have achieved significant advancements in medium-range weather forecasting. However, they generally depend on the initial fields generated by the computationally expensive four-dimensional variational (4DVar) data assimilation (DA) technique, which limits their real-time applicability in multivariate three-dimensional (3D) weather forecasting. Here we propose 4DVarFormer by exploring the potential of integrating the 4DVar constraint into an attention-based neural network. 4DVarFormer eliminates the need for background error covariance statistics and the complex adjoint model development. It can generate multivariate 3D weather states within 0.37 s. Moreover, 4DVarFormer can capture inter-variable relationships, allowing the assimilation of observed variables to correct unobserved variables. Hence, medium-range forecasts initiated by 4DVarFormer outperform those of DL-based DA methods and achieve performance comparable to the forecasts initiated by ERA5 reanalyses. These promising findings contribute to future advancements in integrated end-to-end DL weather forecasting systems."

 Wintertime atmospheric blocking often brings adverse environmental and socioeconomic impacts through its accompanying temperature and precipitation extremes. However, due to the chaotic nature of the extratropical atmospheric circulation and the challenges in simulating blocking, the skillful seasonal prediction of blocking remains elusive. In this study, we leverage both observational data and seasonal hindcasts from a state-of-the-art seasonal prediction system to investigate the prediction skill of North Pacific wintertime blocking frequency and its linkage to downstream cold extremes. The observational results show that North Pacific blocking has a local maximum over the central North Pacific Ocean and that the occurrence of North Pacific blocking drives significant cold anomalies over northwestern North America within a week, which are both well reproduced by the model. The model skillfully predicts the western North Pacific blocking frequency near the subtropical jet exit region at the shortest forecast lead, but skill drops off rapidly with lead time partly due to model drift in the background flow. To overcome this rapid drop in skill, we develop a linear hybrid dynamical-statistical model that uses the forecasted Niño 3.4 index and upstream precipitation as predictors and that maintains significant forecast skill of high-latitude North Pacific blocking up to 7 lead months in advance. Our results indicate that an improvement in the seasonal prediction skill of winter North Pacific blocking frequency may be achieved by the enhanced representation of the links among sea surface temperature anomalies, tropical convection, and the ensuing tropical-extratropical interaction that initiates North Pacific blocking."

 Planktonic mixotrophs, including ciliates, are abundant, yet understudied, mediators of primary and secondary production in aquatic food webs. Here, we report high-resolution in situ observations of a thin layer—a vertically limited patch of high organism abundance—of the ciliate, Laboea strobila. Within the thin layer, peak L. strobila abundances were as high as 62,000 cells/L, six times higher than previously reported, and were strongly positively correlated with co-measured chlorophyll a concentrations, indicating that the organism indulged in kleptoplasty, retaining plastids from ingested algae. Estimates indicated L. strobila contributed to ~63–78% of chlorophyll a within the layer, in sharp contrast to conventional expectations that phytoplankton dominate this signature, suggesting that mixotroph biomass, and consequently, their contribution to marine ecosystems is widely underestimated. These observations also highlight the importance of pairing traditional approaches such as chlorophyll a measurements with high-resolution imaging for proper attribution of biomass proxies.

 Projected changes in atmospheric blocking and associated extreme weather are marked by considerable uncertainties. While paleoclimate records could help reduce these uncertainties, their low temporal resolution makes extracting synoptic-scale signals challenging. Here, a deep learning model is developed to infer summertime blocking frequency from tree-ring-based gridded reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere surface temperature over the Last Millennium. The model, despite not directly incorporating paleoclimate proxies or their locations, is implicitly constrained by them. The reconstructions highlight the tropical Pacific’s strong influence on blocking variability at interannual-to-centennial time scales. A weakened tropical Pacific zonal temperature gradient during the Little Ice Age correlates with a hemispherically reduced -yet more variable interannually- blocking frequency and altered regional patterns. This deep learning approach offers a pathway for extracting paleoweather signals from paleoclimate records that enables improved understanding of blocking response to external forcing and constraining of model projections of blocking under climate change scenarios.

 Black carbon is a refractory form of organic carbon formed from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. Riverine transport is considered the dominant pathway of black carbon to the coastal oceans. However, the provenance and pathways of black carbon to the open ocean remain unknown. Here we use both stable and radiogenic isotopes of carbon to show that sedimentary black carbon across the equatorial Atlantic Ocean is aeolian and primarily derived from biomass burning of C4-plants. Fluxes of surface sedimentary black carbon measured along an equatorial Atlantic Ocean transect using chemothermal oxidation at 375 °C were relatively consistent across the Atlantic, ranging from 0.10–0.35 mg cm−2 kyr−1. Carbon isotope values near Africa suggest the black carbon was mostly young and derived from C4 plants, whereas offshore South America, the black carbon was older and dominated by C3 plants. The black carbon radiocarbon values were similar to the reservoir corrected total organic carbon near Africa, implying little pre-aging on land and increased westwards. These findings highlight the influence of C4-biomass burning in the tropical Atlantic and the importance of aeolian deposition as a black carbon source within the global carbon cycle.

 Volcanic tsunamis pose significant threats to nearby coastal communities. Despite extensive research, the mechanism behind tsunami generation remains unclear, and the ability to forecast a destructive tsunami has proven elusive. Here we present findings from the 2022 Tonga volcanic incident, showing that the leading air-pressure wave holds promise as a key predictor of tsunami behavior. We constructed an integrated atmosphere-ocean model to explain the underlying mechanism and validated it with various data, including satellite altimetry measurements. Contrary to prior hypotheses, our results reveal that: (1) the eruption process governs both the air-pressure and tsunami dynamics; and (2) the resulting crater volume controls the volcanic ejecta that produces the air-pressure waves, while the corresponding mass loss in the ocean triggers influxes of water into the crater, generating the tsunami. This study unveils a coupled atmosphere-ocean source mechanism in generating volcanic tsunamis and advocates for incorporating air-pressure sensors into early warning systems.

 Ongoing acquisition of Martian surface imagery constantly provides new opportunities to reveal previously undiscovered small-scale volcanic landforms, yielding critical insights into volcanic processes, and challenging existing inferences. Here, using the most recent, high-resolution topographical data, we mapped the accumulation of pyroclastic deposits occurring along the margins of several volcanic vents.

The identification of these very recent (<100 Ma) deposits across the entire Tharsis volcanic province needs reconciling with our current view of the evolution of explosive volcanism on Mars.

 Global warming already influences precipitation, with more intense precipitation in many locations. Although the ‘wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier’ tendency in mean precipitation holds in many locations, the situations for precipitation extremes are more complex, due to changes in dynamic and thermodynamic influences on atmospheric moisture distributions. Here, we build a dynamically interactive atmospheric moisture model for the present (2006–2025) and the future climate (2081–2100), using outputs from coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. We find that the dynamic process of vertical advection of moisture dominates the same-day precipitation, while the smaller impact of the thermodynamic process provides available moisture for several days. As climate warms, we find that the dynamical-induced precipitation more completely exhausts the vertically-integrated moisture and the distribution of the dynamic process’s impact on precipitation exhibits a greater spread in the warmer future. The dynamical process is primarily responsible for more extreme heavy precipitation as climate warms, at all latitudes.

 Tropical cyclone activity often leads to many adverse impacts and assessing their destructiveness is a crucial scientific concern. Here we investigated changes in the destructiveness of tropical cyclones worldwide using the power dissipation index and found that there is no clear trend in most basins, but a significant decrease in power dissipation index has been detected in the South Indian Ocean basin since 1994, which is almost entirely due to a decrease in both tropical cyclone frequency and duration in this basin. The decrease in tropical cyclone frequency is influenced by increased atmospheric stability. The decrease in tropical cyclone duration can be attributed to the changes in tropical cyclone locations. In addition, the weakened subtropical high is only observed in the South Indian Ocean (i.e., the Mascarene High), which is also associated with the decrease in tropical cyclone destructiveness.

 Carbonate mud is crucial in the global carbon cycle and serves as a key sedimentary archive for paleoclimate reconstruction. Understanding the mechanisms behind its formation is crucial for explaining long-term carbon storage, including atmospheric carbon dioxide transfer to the hydrosphere and variations in mud production over geological timescales. Various mechanisms explain carbonate mud formation in both lake and marine sediments. Using bio-physicochemical methods on deep sediments of Lake Ilay, Jura, France, we propose a model of micrite formation. Our study shows that micrite mineralization occurs in sediments due to the degradation of ooze rich in exopolymeric substances throughout the sediment core’s depth. This mineralization continues as long as exopolymeric substances are present, persisting for at least 2000 years. Cryo-Scanning electron microscope imaging reveals calcite nucleation at degraded exopolymeric substance nodes, advancing with substance degradation and calcium release.

 Accurate detection sensitivity characterization of remote methane monitoring technologies is critical for designing, implementing, and auditing effective emissions monitoring and mitigation programs. Several research groups have developed test methods based on single/double-blind controlled release protocols and regression-based data analysis techniques to create probability of detection (PoD) models for characterizing remote sensor detection sensitivities. The previously created methods and models account for some of the important factors that affect detection sensitivity, such as wind speed, and in the case of Conrad et al. flight altitude. However, these models do not account for other important factors, such as 1) light levels received by the remote sensor due to variations in terrain albedo or other factors, 2) spatial density of remote sensing measurements, or 3) variation in individual sensor performance. In this paper, we build on the work of Conrad et al. by introducing a gas concentration noise (GCN) model for Gas Mapping LiDAR aerial methane detection technology that, when combined with wind speed at the emission location, accounts for all significant sensor and environmental parameters that affect detection sensitivity for scenarios involving an isolated emission source - a source that does not spatially overlap with a methane plume originating from another source location. We incorporate the GCN model into Conrad et al.'s PoD model and apply it to several sets of controlled release data acquired across widely varying deployment and environmental conditions to develop PoD models for Bridger Photonics Inc.'s first- and second-generation (GML 1.0 and GML 2.0, respectively) Gas Mapping LiDAR sensors. Finally, we compare controlled release data acquired by GML 2.0 in different geographic regions and terrain cover types, in different wind conditions, deployed on different aircraft types, and with different flight parameters. Results show that the GML 2.0 PoD model remains valid regardless of the location or conditions under which the sensors are deployed, and the aircraft and flight parameters used for deployment. Based on PoD measurements in 12 production basins across North America, the average 90 % PoD emission rate for sites measured by GML 2.0 in 2023 was 1.27 kg/h."

 Radiative efficiency (RE) is a climate metric adopted in international reports on climate change to quantify the greenhouse capacity of gases, and hence to guide decision-making processes and drive transitions in the production and utilization of chemicals in different application fields. Key quantities for the determination of the RE of a gas are the atmospheric irradiance profile and the infrared (IR) absorption cross section spectrum. The latter is usually measured experimentally, even though acquiring high-quality IR spectra can pose severe challenges, sometimes limiting the accuracy or the accessible spectral range. While computational quantum chemistry methods have emerged as valuable tools to simulate IR absorption properties, their application to REs estimation is still limited to the use of the double-harmonic approximation, which presents fundamental limitations. In this work, a cost-effective quantum chemical (QC) workflow including non-empirical anharmonic contributions to spectral properties and an automatic identification of conformer distribution is presented for the accurate evaluation of REs using a range of atmospheric irradiance profiles. Different levels of theory are considered, according to the current state-of-the-art, and the accuracy of the QC RE tool is demonstrated with reference to a number of representative halocarbons widely used in refrigeration, manufacturing, and pharmaceutical fields. The results show that REs can be computed with an average accuracy of 5% using double-hybrid functionals, which overshoot the widely used B3LYP method. Finally, the QC methodology is applied to determine the REs of selected halocarbons for which data is limited, or to address some contradictory results appeared in the literature for some species. The outcomes of this work demonstrate that QC anharmonic IR cross section spectra can be used to estimate REs with an accuracy on par with that of experimental measurements, hence applicable to challenging cases for providing data for policymakers as well for screening purposes when seeking new replacement compounds."

 Long-term series of high-resolution gridded precipitation datasets are essential for hydrological and meteorological research. Producing high-resolution precipitation data from regional models demands substantial computational resources and labor. Global Reanalyses offer long-term coverage and effectively capture annual and seasonal precipitation patterns. However, they have inadequate resolution and frequently have difficulties depicting extreme conditions. This study proposes an efficient and accurate approach for generating long-term series of high spatial and temporal resolution precipitation. It is achieved by leveraging deep learning techniques to integrate the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global climate reanalysis (ERA5, 0.25°, hourly) data with high-resolution precipitation fusion datasets. Considering the heavy-tailed distribution of precipitation, we developed the PreciDBPN model structure, which combines a classification network with a super-resolution network and incorporates physically relevant indices into the model's input. We trained and evaluated the PreciDBPN and baseline models in eastern China using the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) precipitation dataset (0.0625°, hourly, 2017–2022). When compared to baseline methods and ERA5, our model excels in multiple metrics and provides a more precise representation of relative rainfall frequency. Independent verification was performed using station observations during the period of 2010–2015 when CLDAS data were unavailable. During this verification, the PreciDBPN demonstrated exceptional performance and greater robustness compared to the baseline models. Because our method can efficiently downscale precipitation and bias-correct reanalysis data using minimal computational resources, it can be used to generate high-resolution precipitation datasets (0.0625°, hourly) from 1979 to 2022 while correcting for heavy precipitation underestimations in reanalysis data."
