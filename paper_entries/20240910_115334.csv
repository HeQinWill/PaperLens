Public perception of economic vs. generational inequalities in climate change mitigation policies,"Climate change and most climate policies affect and reinforce different forms of inequalities. For instance, climate change policies that aim to change consumer behavior by increasing the price tag of goods and services that cause carbon emissions often carry a disproportionately higher burden (in terms of financial cost) to those with lower incomes. They can thereby either exacerbate existing income inequalities or contribute to generating new ones. Meanwhile, refraining from engaging with climate mitigation policies will incur other detrimental societal costs: the financial burden and the harmful consequences of climate change that future generations will have to bear if nothing is done. In this paper, we examine how the immediate economic inequality citizens face from climate mitigation policies (regarding carbon taxation) weighs against the long-term generational inequalities future generations will experience. We study how both types of inequality relate to policy support for climate change mitigation policies in the context of Germany. The German case is of special interest because a recent court ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court allows us to test whether making people aware of a new legal reality can bridge the gap between the economic and generational inequality. Our findings using a between-subjects survey experiment fielded among German citizens (N = 6,319) in 2022 show that immediate economic concerns trump future generational concerns, generally making citizens less supportive of the policy. This negative support is however somewhat mitigated by the supportive signal from the court ruling."

Understanding their influence can provide seasonal predictability of agricultural production metrics to inform decision-making and mitigate potential food security challenges. Here, we analyze the effects of ENSO and IOD on four agricultural production metrics (production, harvested area, irrigated area, and yields) for rice, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, and finger millet across India from 1968 to 2015. El Niños and positive-IODs are associated with simultaneous reductions in the production and yields of multiple crops. Impacts vary considerably by crop and geography. Maize and pearl millet experience large declines in both production and yields when compared to other grains in districts located in the northwest and southern peninsular regions. Associated with warmer and drier conditions during El Niño, >70% of all crop districts experience lower production and yields. Impacts of positive-IODs exhibit relatively more spatial variability. La Niña and negative-IODs are associated with simultaneous increases in all production metrics across the crops, particularly benefiting traditional grains. Variations in impacts of ENSO and IOD on different cereals depend on where they are grown and differences in their sensitivity to climate conditions. We compare production metrics for each crop relative to rice in overlapping rainfed districts to isolate the influence of climate conditions. Maize production and yields experience larger reductions relative to rice, while pearl millet production and yields also experience reductions relative to rice during El Niños and positive-IODs. However, sorghum experiences enhanced production and harvested areas, and finger millet experiences enhanced production and yields. These findings suggest that transitioning from maize and rice to these traditional cereals could lower interannual production variability associated with natural climate variations."

Here we evaluate the limiting physical constraints, for three types of systems: two- and three-dimensional infrastructure and atmospheric oxidation enhancement, focusing on removing low ( 1000 ppm) and ambient ( 2 ppm) methane from air. With the space velocities and removal efficiencies of current three-dimensional technologies, volumes of 7–350 km3 are required to remove 1 Tg CH4 yr−1. Two-dimensional solutions are limited by the transport rate of methane to a surface. If every molecule of methane that collides with the surface is removed, an area of 1130 km2 is needed to remove 1 Tg CH4 yr−1 at ambient concentration. However, research shows that per-collision reaction probabilities are 10−8 requiring a surface area of 1010–1015 km2. Finally, we examine atmospheric oxidation enhancement, where 4.8 Tg yr−1 of Cl or 8.8 Tg yr−1 of OH is required to remove 1 Tg CH4 yr−1, with precursors such as H2O2 or O3. However, limitations arise concerning multiple environmental impacts. We conclude that the physical and practical constraints are considerable, and identify the main barriers that must be addressed."

To investigate the connectivity of multiple spatial flow processes, we conducted a one-year field study to measure lateral hydrologic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes across the continental shelf in the Yangtze estuary. We observed a significant correlation between the differences in remote sensing-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP) (ΔGPPMODIS) and the differences in eddy covariance (EC) tower-based GPP (ΔGPPEC) at both high-elevation and low-elevation sites. Our findings indicate that the saltmarsh acts as a net source of dissolved total C while serving as a net sink for dissolved total N. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation in the total dissolved stoichiometry of the C/N ratio between imports from and exports to adjacent aquatic systems. These findings highlight the importance of integrating ecological stoichiometric principles to improve our understanding of the complex relationships among physical, chemical, and ecological processes, particularly within the context of the meta-ecosystem framework. Additionally, when reciprocal hydrological lateral C and N flows are considered, a single ecosystem can function as both a source and sink within the meta-ecosystem framework."

Strategies to address both crises must consider the relationships, synergies and trade-offs between key response measures, including sustainable production and consumption patterns, protected areas (PAs) and climate mitigation policy (CP). In this paper, we review a large set of scenarios (n = 96) from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) describing future development of land use, greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on CC and biodiversity. We calculate the global mean temperature increase (GMTI) and the Mean Species Abundance (MSA) of plants, a metric indicative of local terrestrial biodiversity intactness. The set includes scenarios with and without specific CP to address CC, PA for biodiversity and demand and supply sustainability measures such as increased energy efficiency and reduced meat consumption. Our findings indicate that scenarios with integrated measures can prevent biodiversity loss at the global scale, yet with clear regional differences. By 2050, 15 out of 30 (50%) scenarios with at least 30% of global land as PAs show positive MSA changes in grasslands and tropical non-forests (Grass & TnF), but only 1 (3%) does so in tropical forests (TF). We demonstrate that pasture and food/feed crops are the main drivers of MSA loss in Grass & TnF and that scenarios with high levels of PAs prevent land conversion and increase biodiversity. By 2100, 28 out of 46 (60%) scenarios with mitigation measures to restrict CC to 2 °C or less in 2100 result in positive MSA changes in TF, but only 13 (28%) do so in Grass & TnF, reflecting the larger impacts of land use change in the latter region. These results underscore the importance of time and regionally-tailored approaches to address the biodiversity and CC crises."

Although the WEN system in cities is intricately connected to socioeconomic activities, relationship between WEN and economic systems remains understudied. This study introduces a tri-dimensional Nexus Pressure Index (NPI) to assess the pressure on WEN system. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and city tiers in the urban agglomeration were used to assess the relationship between the characteristics of WEN and economic system. We conducted a case study of 296 cities in China and 1330 counties in the United States from 2012 to 2019. During the 9 year study period, on average, pressure on WEN system have relieved by 22% in China and 27% in the United States, measured by NPI. Cities with most ideal characteristics (low pressure in all dimensions) rank merely in the middle of all eight classes, with GDP per capita 74% and 85% of the highest-GDP-per-capita class in China and the US respectively. Well-performing WEN system does not yield best economic outcomes. High water pressure correlates with better economic performance in the US, while high-energy-pressure cities had GDP per capita about 50% and 70% of the class with highest GDP per capita in China and the US, respectively, suggesting stronger economic constraints from energy stress. Urban agglomeration analysis revealed a negative relationship between WEN and economic performance. NPI in emerging cities is 0.6–1 lower than NPI in regionally-central cities in China, while 0.2–0.5 lower in the US. These results underscore the contradiction between preferred WEN characteristics and higher economic performance, and underpin the resource curse hypothesis at city-level in the two considered giants. A sustainable approach to harmonize WEN and economic system is in urgent need."

Because the response of the ocean–atmosphere system to mCDR takes years to centuries, modeling is required to assess the impact of mCDR on atmospheric CO2 reduction. Here, we use a coupled ocean–atmosphere model to quantify the atmospheric CO2 reduction in response to a CDR perturbation. We define two metrics to characterize the atmospheric CO2 response to both instantaneous ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) and direct air capture (DAC): the cumulative additionality (α) measures the reduction in atmospheric CO2 relative to the magnitude of the CDR perturbation, while the relative efficiency (ϵ) quantifies the cumulative additionality of mCDR relative to that of DAC. For DAC, α is 100% immediately following CDR deployment, but declines to roughly 50% by 100 years post-deployment as the ocean degasses CO2 in response to the removal of carbon from the atmosphere. For instantaneous OAE, α is zero initially and reaches a maximum of 40%–90% several years to decades later, depending on regional CO2 equilibration rates and ocean circulation processes. The global mean ϵ approaches 100% after 40 years, showing that instantaneous OAE is nearly as effective as DAC after several decades. However, there are significant geographic variations, with ϵ approaching 100% most rapidly in the low latitudes while ϵ stays well under 100% for decades to centuries near deep and intermediate water formation sites. These metrics provide a quantitative framework for evaluating sequestration timescales and carbon market valuation that can be applied to any mCDR strategy."

Combining ground-based measurements of pollen concentrations and satellite observations of cloud properties within the United States, we show that enhanced pollen concentrations during springtime lead to an increase in cloud ice fraction of up to 0.1 in the temperature regime where pollen are considered to act as INP (−15 C and −25 C ). We further establish the link from the pollen-induced increase in cloud ice to a higher precipitation frequency. In light of anthropogenic climate change, the extended and strengthened pollen season and future alterations in biodiversity can introduce a localized climate forcing and a modification of the precipitation frequency and intensity."

Quantifying the specific ecological impacts of permafrost thaw remains elusive, as ecological variations are also influenced by external climate factors. This study tackles this gap by employing the Noah-MP model to simultaneously simulate permafrost thermal–hydrological dynamics and net primary production (NPP) across the Three River Headwaters Region from 1989 to 2018. Model results were validated against observations. To isolate the ecological effects of permafrost thaw, we implemented a novel relative time transformation on the simulation results. Our analysis reveals a 7.5 × 104 km2 reduction in permafrost coverage during the study period, coinciding with a 1.09 g C m−2 yr−2 increase in NPP. While precipitation is the primary driver of NPP changes in most years, soil moisture emerges as a crucial factor during permafrost disappearance, when the ground transitions to seasonally frozen ground. Surprisingly, the NPP response to permafrost disappearance exhibited a transient effect, diminishing to negligible levels within five years post-thaw. These findings enhance our understanding of the intricate and dynamic responses of the QTP ecosystem to permafrost degradation under a warming climate."

While traditional dynamic and empirical models suffer from systematic errors due to nonlinear processes, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are nonlinear in nature and have demonstrated remarkable El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and IOD forecasting skills based on oceanic predictors, particularly sea surface temperature and heat content. However, it is difficult to measure heat content and easily introduces uncertainties, prompting the need to explore atmospheric predictors for IOD forecasts. Based on sensitivity prediction experiments, we identified the sea level pressure (SLP) signal as a crucial predictor, which forecasts IOD at a 7 month lead. In addition, the CNN model improves monthly forecasting accuracy while reducing errors by 13.43%. Utilizing the heatmap analysis, we elucidated that the multi-seasonal predictability of the IOD primarily originates from mid-latitude climate variability. Besides ENSO signals in the Pacific Ocean, our study highlights the significant impact of remote climate forcing in the South Indian Ocean, tropical North Indian Ocean, and Northwest Pacific Ocean on IOD forecasts. By introducing the SLP precursor and extratropical zones into IOD forecasts, our study offers fresh insights into the underlying dynamics of IOD evolution."

Local communities on these islands organize beach clean-ups regularly to tackle this problem and, because their waste systems cannot handle the enormous amounts of plastic, predominantly incinerate the collected waste. However, as long as plastic waste keeps entering the ocean, beach clean-ups alone cannot be sustained. The first crucial step to solving this problem is to determine the main sources of plastic waste to the islands. In this study, we simulate the transport of floating plastic waste to determine the main riverine sources of plastic reaching the islands. We find that the majority of simulated plastic waste comes from just 4 Indonesian rivers: the Solo, Brantas, Ci Tanduy, and Wai Sekampung. We suggest that further numerical and field studies, as well as potential river clean-up efforts focus on these rivers to stop plastic waste inundating Christmas Island and the Cocos Keeling Islands."

However, more attention is needed, particularly regarding the content and concentration of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), especially in the context of climate change (CC) impacts. To address this, various controlled field experiments were conducted, involving the cultivation of three wheat cultivars over three growing seasons at multiple locations with different soil and climate conditions under varying Fe and Zn treatments. The yield and yield attributes, including nutritional values such as nitrogen (N), Fe and Zn, from these experiments were integrated with national yield statistics from other locations to train and test different machine learning (ML) algorithms. Automated ML leveraging a large number of models, outperformed traditional ML models, enabling the training and testing of numerous models, and achieving robust predictions of grain yield (GY) (R2 > 0.78), N (R2 > 0.75), Fe (R2 > 0.71) and Zn (R2 > 0.71) through a stacked ensemble of all models.

Averaged across different GCMs and SSPs, CC is projected to increase wheat yield by 4.5%, and protein concentration by 0.8% with high variability. However, it is expected to decrease Fe concentration by 5.5%, and Zn concentration by 4.5% in the mid-century (2020–2050) relative to the historical period (1980–2010).

Based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), this study reveals a close linkage of the variability of spring (April–May) vegetation in MHA to the winter (December–January–February) Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. When the winter PNA pattern lies in the positive phase, the NDVI tends to decrease in most parts of the MHA region during the following spring. Further analysis suggests that the lagged influence of winter PNA on spring atmospheric circulations and hence the vegetation in MHA is accomplished by the stratospheric pathway. The positive PNA phase can enhance the upward transport of wave energy into the stratosphere over the high latitudes in winter through the linear constructive interference of zonal wavenumber 1 (WN1), consequently leading to a weaker polar vortex in the stratosphere during February-March. Subsequently, the weakened polar vortex signal propagates downward from the stratosphere to the troposphere, inducing the negative Arctic Oscillation-like circulation with an anomalous cyclonic circulation dominating the MHA region in spring. The anomalous cyclonic circulation further cools the surface air temperature in MHA via modulating downward solar radiation and temperature advection, resulting in a decrease of spring NDVI in situ."

We propose a combined framework of panel regression model and multi-objective optimization model to identify the key digital sectors and obtain their optimal total outputs. First, the results show that digital inputs continue to increase in most countries (regions) from 2000 to 2021, especially in the USA, EU countries and China. Digital equipment inputs in China are the most significant, while digital service inputs in the USA and EU countries are relatively important. Second, the regression results show that digital service inputs have significantly negative influence on carbon emissions, which means that the growth of digital service inputs will decrease carbon emissions. This result indicates that the key point of industrial digitalization for carbon emission reduction may be increasing the digital service inputs. Third, the optimization results show that the digital-input-oriented optimization model, which encourages an increase in digital service inputs, could achieve greater targets of economic growth and carbon emission reduction. The total outputs of Telecommunication Services and Computer Services should increase globally by 10.24% and 8.89%, respectively."

Approximately 90% of sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) agriculture is rainfed under smallholder farmers who constitute about 60% of the continent’s population and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. While AWM is central to the African agenda, knowledge of AWM is fragmented, making it challenging to operationalize regional initiatives at country levels. Therefore, this study sought to review the status of AWM practices and technologies in Africa and provide guidelines, scenarios, and investment plans to guide the prioritization and operationalization of the African Union’s irrigation development and AWM (AU-IDAWM) initiative. The initiative proposes four developmental pathways; 1—improved water control and watershed management in rain-fed farming, 2—farmer-led irrigation, 3—irrigation scheme development and modernization, and 4—unconventional water use for irrigation. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses approach guided the systematic literature review. The study indicates that most agricultural production systems are mainly under pathways 1 and 2, which dictate the subsequent AWM practices. Pathway 4 had isolated adoption in North Africa. SSA exhibited overlaps in opportunities for AWM, whereas North Africa had green energy and strong extension services. The challenges were unique to each geopolitical region. Policy-related issues affected North Africa, whilst low investment in AWM dominated West Africa. Poor institutional coordination plagued East Africa, whilst low access to extension services affected Southern Africa. The Central African region was undermined by poor management practices that culminated in soil salinity in the agricultural lands. Targeted and scalable investments across interventions are necessary topotentially improve AWM uptake and subsequent food security in the continent.

Ryerson;Gregory J. Frost;Brian C. McDonald;Owen R. Cooper,Tropical tropospheric ozone distribution and trends from in situ and satellite data,"The study examines tropical tropospheric ozone changes. In situ data from 1994–2019 display increased ozone, notably over India, Southeast Asia, and Malaysia and Indonesia. Sparse in situ data limit trend detection for the 15-year period. In situ and satellite data, with limited sampling, struggle to consistently detect trends. Continuous observations are vital over the tropical Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, western Africa, and South Asia for accurate ozone trend estimation in these regions. 
 Tropical tropospheric ozone (TTO) is important for the global radiation budget because the longwave radiative effect of tropospheric ozone is higher in the tropics than midlatitudes. In recent decades the TTO burden has increased, partly due to the ongoing shift of ozone precursor emissions from midlatitude regions toward the Equator. In this study, we assess the distribution and trends of TTO using ozone profiles measured by high-quality in situ instruments from the IAGOS (In-Service Aircraft for a Global Observing System) commercial aircraft, the SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesondes) network, and the ATom (Atmospheric Tomographic Mission) aircraft campaign, as well as six satellite records reporting tropical tropospheric column ozone (TTCO): TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), OMI/Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS)/Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI)/Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME2). With greater availability of ozone profiles across the tropics we can now demonstrate that tropical India is among the most polluted regions (e.g., western Africa, tropical South Atlantic, Southeast Asia, Malaysia and Indonesia), with present-day 95th percentile ozone values reaching 80 nmol mol−1 in the lower free troposphere, comparable to midlatitude regions such as northeastern China and Korea. In situ observations show that TTO increased between 1994 and 2019, with the largest mid- and upper-tropospheric increases above India, Southeast Asia, and Malaysia and Indonesia (from 3.4 ± 0.8 to 6.8 ± 1.8 nmol mol−1 decade−1), reaching 11 ± 2.4 and 8 ± 0.8 nmol mol−1 decade−1 close to the surface (India and Malaysia–Indonesia, respectively). The longest continuous satellite records only span 2004–2019 but also show increasing ozone across the tropics when their full sampling is considered, with maximum trends over Southeast Asia of 2.31 ± 1.34 nmol mol−1 decade−1 (OMI) and 1.69 ± 0.89 nmol mol−1 decade−1 (OMI/MLS). In general, the sparsely sampled aircraft and ozonesonde records do not detect the 2004–2019 ozone increase, which could be due to the genuine trends on this timescale being masked by the additional uncertainty resulting from sparse sampling. The fact that the sign of the trends detected with satellite records changes above three IAGOS regions, when their sampling frequency is limited to that of the in situ observations, demonstrates the limitations of sparse in situ sampling strategies. This study exposes the need to maintain and develop high-frequency continuous observations (in situ and remote sensing) above the tropical Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, western Africa, and South Asia in order to estimate accurate and precise ozone trends for these regions. In contrast, Southeast Asia and Malaysia–Indonesia are regions with such strong increases in ozone that the current in situ sampling frequency is adequate to detect the trends on a relatively short 15-year timescale."

We unravel source contributions to INPs in the eastern Mediterranean and find that biological particles are important, regardless of their origin. The parameterizations developed exhibit superior performance and enable models to consider biological-particle effects on INPs. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) are one of the most uncertain drivers of the hydrological cycle and climate change. A synergy of in situ, remote-sensing and modelling experiments were used to determine the source of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) for MPCs at Mount Helmos in the eastern Mediterranean. The influences of boundary layer turbulence, vertical aerosol distributions and meteorological conditions were also examined. When the observation site is in the free troposphere (FT), approximately 1 in ×106 aerosol particles serve as INPs around −25 °C. The INP abundance spans 3 orders of magnitude and increases in the following order: marine aerosols; continental aerosols; and, finally, dust plumes. Biological particles are important INPs observed in continental and marine aerosols, whereas they play a secondary, although important, role during Saharan dust events. Air masses in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) show both enriched INP concentrations and a higher proportion of INPs to total aerosol particles, compared with cases in the FT. The presence of precipitation/clouds enriches INPs in the FT but decreases INPs in the PBL. Additionally, new INP parameterizations are developed that incorporate the ratio of fluorescent-to-nonfluorescent or coarse-to-fine particles and predict >90 % of the observed INPs within an uncertainty range of a factor of 10; these new parameterizations exhibit better performance than current widely used parameterizations and allow ice formation in models to respond to variations in dust and biological particles. The improved parameterizations can help MPC formation simulations in regions with various INP sources or different regions with prevailing INP sources."

We find strong warming and drying effects due to the ozone-induced inhibition on plant stomatal conductance, especially over polluted regions such as the eastern US and China. These climatic perturbations further enhance surface ozone by decreasing dry deposition but reduce aerosol optical depth by increasing cloudiness and the drought tendency. 
 The coupling between surface ozone (O3) and vegetation significantly influences the regional to global climate. O3 uptake by plant stomata inhibits the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, impacting evapotranspiration through land surface ecosystems. Using a climate–vegetation–chemistry coupled model (the NASA GISS ModelE2 coupled with the Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere, or ModelE2-YIBs), we assess the global climatic responses to O3–vegetation interactions during the boreal summer of the present day (2005–2014). High O3 pollution reduces stomatal conductance, resulting in warmer and drier conditions worldwide. The most significant responses are found in the eastern US and eastern China, where the surface air temperature increases by +0.33 ± 0.87 and +0.56 ± 0.38 °C, respectively. These temperature increases are accompanied by decreased latent heat and increased sensible heat in both regions. The O3–vegetation interaction also affects atmospheric pollutants. The surface maximum daily 8 h average O3 concentrations increase by +1.46 ± 3.02 ppbv in eastern China and +1.15 ± 1.77 ppbv in the eastern US due to the O3-induced inhibition of stomatal uptake. With reduced atmospheric stability following a warmer climate, increased cloud cover but decreased relative humidity jointly reduce aerosol optical depth by −0.06 ± 0.01 (−14.67 ± 12.15 %) over eastern China. This study suggests that vegetation feedback should be considered for a more accurate assessment of climatic perturbations caused by tropospheric O3."

To our knowledge, the resolution and length of this dataset is enough in detecting the asymmetry, vertical tilt, temporal evolution of MEs, and the submesoscale processes. The dataset is expected to improve the accuracy of current and biogeochemistry numerical model. More projects gathering AUVs network will be promoted in future. 
 Marginal seas are usually fulfilled with strongly varying mesoscale eddies (MEs), which evolutions plays vital roles in regulating global oceanic energy equilibrium, triggering subemesoscale processes with strong vertical velocity, and inducing high biogeochemistry transport. But the temporal evolutions of MEs and submesoscale processes with several kilometers’ resolutions are difficult to be measured by traditional observations with passive working mode. The automatic underwater gliders (AUGs) and vehicles (AUVs) positively observe oceanic motion, and could provide us spatiotemporal synchronization information for strongly varying MEs. Here, we present a 9-year high dense dataset of AUVs/AUGs observations in 2014–2022 in the South China Sea (SCS) can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.11996 (Qiu et al., 2024b). Totally, 9 AUG and 2 AUV cruise experiments were conducted, and 83 AUGs (2 AUVs) equipment were deployed with zonal and temporal resolutions of < 7 km and <6 hour. It covers the area of eddy’s birth, propagation, and dissipation, presenting us the most complete data to investigate the evolution of MEs at different life stages. 40 % of them reach resolutions < 1 km and < 1 hour, which provides us the dynamic characteristics of submesoscale instabilities across and along front at the eddy edge. This dataset has potential in improving the forecast accuracy in physical and biogeochemistry numerical model. Much more aggressive field investigation programs will be promoted by the NSFC in future."

 The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) holds several petabytes of climate data distributed across millions of files held in data centers worldwide. Obtaining and manipulating the scientific information (climate variables) held in these files is non-trivial. The ESGF Virtual Aggregation is one of several solutions to providing an out-of-the-box aggregated and analysis ready view of those variables. Here we discuss the ESGF Virtual Aggregation in the context of the existing infrastructure, and some of those other solutions providing analysis ready data. We describe how it is constructed, how it can be used, and provide some performance evaluation. It will be seen that the ESGF Virtual Aggregation provides a sustainable solution to some of the problems encountered in producing analysis ready data, without the cost of data replication to different formats, albeit at the cost of more data movement within the analysis than some alternatives. If heavily used, it may also require more ESGF data servers than are currently deployed in data node deployments. The need for such data servers should be a component of ongoing discussions about the future of the ESGF and its constituent core services."

Bacteria-based bioassays offer cost-effective and rapid toxicity assessments. However, the application of these bioassays for air toxicity assessment has been challenging, due to the instability of bacterial survival and functionality when directly exposed to air pollutants. Here, we developed an approach employing self-assembly passive colonization hydrogel (SAPCH) for in situ air toxicity assessment. The SAPCH features a core–shell structure, enabling the quantitatively immobilization of bacteria on its shell while continuously provides nutrients from its core. An antimicrobial polyelectrolyte layer between the core and shell confines bacteria to the air–liquid interface, synchronizing bacterial survival with exposure to air pollutants. The SAPCH immobilized a battery of natural and recombinant luminescent bacteria, enabling simultaneous detection of various toxicological endpoints (cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and oxidative stress) of air pollutants within 2 h. Its sensitivity was 3–5 orders of magnitude greater than that of traditional liquid-phase toxicity testing, and successfully evaluating the toxicity of volatile organic compounds and combustion smoke.

Questions have arisen, though, regarding their mechanistic controls and reliability. Here, we report contrasting tree-ring Hg records in three collocated conifer species: Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and European larch (Larix decidua), which are from a remote boreal forest. Centennial atmospheric Hg trends at the site, derived from varved lake sediments, peats, and atmospheric monitoring, indicated a steady rise from the 1800s, peaking in the 1970s, and then declining. Prior to ca. 2005, larch and spruce tree rings reproduced the peak in the atmospheric Hg trend, while pine tree rings peaked in the 1930s, likely due to the prolonged sapwood period and ambiguity in the heartwood–sapwood boundary of pine. Since ca. 2005, tree rings from all species showed increasing Hg concentrations in the physiologically active outer rings despite declining atmospheric Hg concentrations. The good agreement between Hg and nitrogen concentrations in active tree-ring cells indicates a similar transport mechanism and cautions against their applicability as atmospheric Hg archives. Our results suggest that tree-ring Hg records are controlled by atmospheric Hg and tree physiology. We provide recommendations for using tree-ring Hg archives that take tree physiology into account."

Discharge and δ7 ${\delta }^{7}$Li are negatively correlated in both events, but mean δ7 ${\delta }^{7}$Li ratios and associated ranges of variation are distinct between them. We apply a previously developed reactive transport model (RTM) for the site to these event‐scale flow perturbations, but observed shifts in stream δ7 ${\delta }^{7}$Li are not reproduced. To reconcile the stability of the subsurface solute weathering profile with our observations of dynamic stream δ7 ${\delta }^{7}$Li signatures, we couple the RTM to a distribution of fluid transit times that evolve based on storm hydrographs. The approach guides appropriate flux‐weighting of fluid from the RTM over a range of flow path lengths, or equivalently fluid residence times.

We employ a combination of synoptic sampling of environmental tracers, endmember mixing calculations, and groundwater flow simulations. Our findings reveal substantial groundwater seepage concentrated near the knickpoint of the main river stem. Using parsimonious groundwater flow modeling, we validate the hypothesis that the topographical shape of the knickpoint enhances local groundwater discharge rates. We quantify that approximately 20% of the total catchment streamflow originates from around the knickpoint.

Here, results from the isotope‐enabled Community Atmosphere Model v.5 are compared with highly resolved and precisely dated isotopic records from speleothems, tree rings, lake and ice cores during the industrial era (1880–2000 CE) and validated against observations from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) network. Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are coupled to the isotopic composition of SASM precipitation through perturbations in the Walker circulation associated with low‐ (IPO) and high‐frequency (ENSO) variability, impacting convective activity over tropical South America and the tropical Atlantic. Changes in convection over this monsoon entrance region ultimately control the downstream oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation recorded in paleoclimate archives. Overall, model results, paleoclimate records and IAEA data agree on the isotopic response to Pacific SST forcing. These results highlight the potential for long isotopic paleoclimate records to reconstruct Pacific climate variability on both high‐ and low‐frequency timescales.

In this work it is shown that membrane contact sites are the biological morphogenesis handles to shape such intracellular mineralization. 
 Silica cell-wall formation in diatoms is a showcase for the ability of organisms to control inorganic mineralization. The process of silicification by these unicellular algae is tightly regulated within a membrane-bound organelle, the silica deposition vesicle (SDV). Two opposing scenarios were proposed to explain the tight regulation of this intracellular process: a template-mediated process that relies on preformed scaffolds, or a template-independent self-assembly process. The present work points to a third scenario, where the SDV membrane is a dynamic mold that shapes the forming silica. We use in-cell cryo-electron tomography to visualize the silicification process in situ, in its native-state, and with a nanometer-scale resolution. This reveals that the plasma membrane interacts with the SDV membrane via physical tethering at membrane contact sites, where the curvature of the tethered side of the SDV membrane mirrors the intricate silica topography. We propose that silica growth and morphogenesis result from the biophysical properties of the SDV and plasma membranes.

 Importin β-superfamily nuclear import receptors (NIRs) mitigate mislocalization and aggregation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), like FUS and TDP-43, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. NIRs potently disaggregate RBPs by recognizing their nuclear localization signal (NLS). However, disease-causing mutations in NLS compromise NIR binding and activity. Here, we define features that characterize the anti-aggregation activity of NIR and NLS. We find that high binding affinity between NIR and NLS, and optimal NLS location relative to the aggregating domain plays a role in determining NIR disaggregation activity. A designed FUS chimera (FUSIBB), carrying the importin β binding (IBB) domain, is solubilized by importin β in vitro, translocated to the nucleus in cultured cells, and downregulates the expression of endogenous FUS. In this study, we posit that guiding the mutual recognition of NLSs and NIRs will aid the development of therapeutics, illustrated by the highly soluble FUSIBB replacing the aggregation-prone endogenous FUS.

Here the authors identify that USP26 deubiquitinase drives the progression of HBV-associated HCC via regulating the protein stability of Sirtuin 1. 
 Despite recent advances in systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced HCC patients remains poor. By screening a sgRNA library targeting human deubiquitinases, we find that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 26 (USP26) deficiency impairs HBV-positive HCC cell proliferation. Genetically engineered murine models with Usp26 knockout confirm that Usp26 drives HCC tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, we find that the HBV-encoded protein HBx binds to the promoter and induces the production of USP26, which is an X-linked gene exclusively expressed in the testis. HBx consequently promotes the association of USP26 with SIRT1 to synergistically stabilize SIRT1 by deubiquitination, which promotes cell proliferation and impedes cell apoptosis to accelerate HCC tumorigenesis. In patients with HBV-positive HCC, USP26 is robustly induced, and its levels correlate with SIRT1 levels and poor prognosis. Collectively, our study highlights a causative link between HBV infection, deubiquitinase induction and development of HCC, identifying a druggable target, USP26.

 Meningiomas are associated with inactivation of NF2/Merlin, but approximately one-third of meningiomas with favorable clinical outcomes retain Merlin expression. Biochemical mechanisms underlying Merlin-intact meningioma growth are incompletely understood, and non-invasive biomarkers that may be used to guide treatment de-escalation or imaging surveillance are lacking. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing, proximity-labeling proteomic mass spectrometry, mechanistic and functional approaches, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) across meningioma xenografts and patients to define biochemical mechanisms and an imaging biomarker that underlie Merlin-intact meningiomas. We find Merlin serine 13 (S13) dephosphorylation drives meningioma Wnt signaling and tumor growth by attenuating inhibitory interactions with β-catenin and activating the Wnt pathway. MRI analyses show Merlin-intact meningiomas with S13 phosphorylation and favorable clinical outcomes are associated with high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).

 Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare Parkinsonian disorder, is characterized by problems with movement, balance, and cognition. PSP differs from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other diseases, displaying abnormal microtubule-associated protein tau by both neuronal and glial cell pathologies. Genetic contributors may mediate these differences; however, the genetics of PSP remain underexplored. Here we conduct the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSP which includes 2779 cases (2595 neuropathologically-confirmed) and 5584 controls and identify six independent PSP susceptibility loci with genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10−8) associations, including five known (MAPT, MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2) and one novel locus (C4A). Integration with cell type-specific epigenomic annotations reveal an oligodendrocytic signature that might distinguish PSP from AD and Parkinson’s disease in subsequent studies. Candidate PSP risk gene prioritization using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) identifies oligodendrocyte-specific effects on gene expression in half of the genome-wide significant loci, and an association with C4A expression in brain tissue, which may be driven by increased C4A copy number. Finally, histological studies demonstrate tau aggregates in oligodendrocytes that colocalize with C4 (complement) deposition. Integrating GWAS with functional studies, epigenomic and eQTL analyses, we identify potential causal roles for variation in MOBP, STX6, RUNX2, SLCO1A2, and C4A in PSP pathogenesis.

 In recent years, predictive machine learning models have gained prominence across various scientific domains. However, their black-box nature necessitates establishing trust in them before accepting their predictions as accurate. One promising strategy involves employing explanation techniques that elucidate the rationale behind a model’s predictions in a way that humans can understand. However, assessing the degree of human interpretability of these explanations is a nontrivial challenge. In this work, we introduce interpretation entropy as a universal solution for evaluating the human interpretability of any linear model.

 The southern Himalayas, characterized by its dense population and hot, humid summers, are confronted with some of the world’s most severe heat stress risks. This study uses the hourly ERA5 dataset (1979–2022) and CMIP6 projections (2005–2100) to evaluate past and future heat stress based on the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). This has significant implications for the management of occupational workloads in the southern Himalayas. Heat stress levels are classified into 6 categories (0 to 5) using WBGT threshold intervals of 23 °C, 25 °C, 28 °C, 30 °C, and 33 °C. With heat stress surpassing level 3 for almost half of the time, people are constrained to engage in less than moderate workloads to ensure their health remains uncompromised. Flow-analogous algorithm is employed to contextualize the unprecedented heat stress case in the summer of 2020 and the associated atmospheric circulation patterns from historical and future perspectives. The results show that over 80% of the time in 2020, heat stress levels were at 3 and 4. The identified circulation pattern explains 27.6% of the extreme intensity, and such an extreme would have been nearly impossible in pre-21st-century climate conditions under the identified pattern. Future projections under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios indicate that heat stress similar to what was experienced in 2020 will likely become a common occurrence across the southern Himalayas. Under a similar circulation pattern, the heat stress levels by the end of the 21st century would be elevated by at least one category compared to the climatic baseline in over 70% of the region, leading to an additional 120.5 (420.1) million daily population exposed to the highest heat stress level under the SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario."

 Leaf area index (LAI) is one of key variables for depicting vegetation structures in land ecosystems. Land surface models necessitate uniform LAI inputs at varying spatial scales to ensure accurate outputs at multiscale levels, however, operational satellite LAI products are acquired only at low spatial resolutions, inhibiting their application at finer spatial scales. Spatial downscaling methods are beneficial for the spatial enhancement of LAI products, and the emergence of deep learning methods has provided promising options for land surface parameter downscaling. However, the potential of deep learning has not been well explored in LAI downscaling. To address this research gap, this study designed an original hierarchical downscaling approach facilitated by generative adversarial network (GAN), transfer learning (TL), and data augmentation techniques to retrieve LAI at fine spatial resolutions, leveraging multiscale satellite images, and cascading from 500-m to 250-m and then to 30-m scales. First, an improved super-resolution GAN (ISRGAN) model was pre-trained using the GLASS LAI and MOD09Q1 products to bridge the general non-linear relationships of LAI between the 500-m and 250-m resolutions. Subsequently, limited reference LAI images were applied to fine-tune this pre-trained ISRGAN model to address the domain shift in the 250-m resolution LAI estimations. Then, the fine-tuned LAI values and the 30-m resolution LAI reference images were utilized as the ISRGAN inputs to produce fine-resolution LAI maps. Finally, the downscaled LAI values derived from the proposed approach were separately validated against reference LAI maps and field measurements across the 250-m and 30-m resolutions. Results show that the fine-tuned transfer learning technique outperforms the pre-trained ISRGAN model and GLASS LAI, with a lower RMSE (0.78) and higher R2 (0.83) at the 250-m resolution. Moreover, the proposed hierarchical downscaling framework achieves better performances for 30-m resolution LAI estimations, regardless of the validation accuracy (R2 = 0.76; RMSE=0.95) and spatiotemporal distributions, than the ISRGAN model which was directly trained by the 500-m and 30-m resolution images. This study highlights that a hierarchical downscaling is valuable for fine-resolution LAI estimations, which leverages multiscale and multisource satellite observations via deep learning."
