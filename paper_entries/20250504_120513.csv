Sartzetakis;Brian Buma,Climate Impact of Direct and Indirect N2O Emissions from the Ammonia Marine Fuel Value Chain,"Ammonia (NH3) emerges as a near-zero-carbon shipping fuel, but its value chain can emit noncarbon greenhouse gases (GHGs) like nitrous oxide (N2O) and pollutants, such as NH3 and nitrogen oxides (NOx). N2O, with 273 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO2), is also indirectly emitted through transformations of reactive nitrogen (Nr) species, like NH3 and NOx, in natural environments. Understanding ammonia’s climate impact is crucial for evaluating its efficacy as a fossil fuel alternative. We present a functional model to quantify the climate impact of renewable-based (e-ammonia) and natural-gas-based (blue and gray) ammonia, focusing on direct and indirect N2O emissions. The model incorporates Nr emissions─NH3, NOx, and N2O─across the value chain under “low”, “medium”, and “high” emissions scenarios, along with production and pilot fuel GHG emissions. Results show that e-ammonia’s climate benefit depends on well-to-wake Nr emissions and natural processes that control relevant nitrogen to indirect N2O (N-to-N2Oi) conversion pathways. In a low emissions scenario, its CO2-equivalent intensity is 68–80% lower than fuel oil, assuming 1–10% N-to-N2Oi conversion. In a high emissions scenario, this benefit drops to 11–23% for 1–2% N-to-N2Oi conversion, and at 5–10% N-to-N2Oi conversion, e-ammonia’s impact exceeds fuel oil by >24%. Blue ammonia could bring ∼30% climate benefit compared to fuel oil, but only in a low emissions scenario with 1–2% N-to-N2Oi conversion. While more data on emissions and N-to-N2Oi conversion are needed, minimizing NH3, NOx, and N2O emissions is crucial to maximizing ammonia’s climate benefits."

Existing single-process optimizations are difficult to meet the diverse and often conflicting needs of the two upstream and downstream processes to recover different P species. Herein, we developed a system-oriented strategy, HyperPhosⓅ, to synergistically address multiprocess requirements. It employs a specially designed one-pot pretreatment to create a unique reaction window for the most recoverable Fe/Al–P, achieving the targeted transformation of unstable P species into homogeneous Fe/Al-orthophosphate of 85.6% in proportion. These compounds exhibited remarkable thermal stability during incineration, with volatilization loss of only 60% of conventional technical route (Conv-Tech) even at 1000 °C. Subsequently, these parts of P were completely leached out using H2C2O4 or NaOH through redox reaction and chelating displacement, with the solvent concentration and the codissolution amounts of heavy metals less than half of the mean levels in the literature. Techno-economic analysis showed that HyperPhosⓅ obtained 1.1–2.4 times more P than Conv-Tech, while the unit cost was reduced by up to 49.5%.

Here, we quantify the diel CE of 229 cities across four climatic zones and employ a machine-learning model to assess the influence of variables on CE. We found that for every 10% increase in tree cover, surface temperatures are reduced by 0.25 °C during the day and 0.04 °C at night. Trees in humid regions exhibit the highest daytime CE, while those in arid zones demonstrate the greatest cooling effect at night. This can be explained by the difference in canopy density between the humid and arid zones. During the day, the high canopy density in the humid zone converts more solar radiation into latent heat flux. At night, the low canopy density in the arid zone intercepts less longwave radiation, which favors surface cooling. While climatic factors contribute nearly twice as much to CE as nonclimatic ones, our findings suggest that optimizing CE is possible by managing variables within specific thresholds due to their nonlinear effects. For instance, we revealed that in arid regions, an impervious surface coverage of approximately 60% is optimal, whereas in humid areas, reducing it to around 40% maximizes cooling benefits. These insights underscore the need for targeted management of nonclimatic factors to sustain tree cooling benefits and offer practical guidance for designing climate-resilient, nature-based urban strategies."

Children exhibit heightened sensitivity to Pb exposure compared to adults, and prenatal Pb exposure can harm the developing fetal nervous system. However, the specific regulatory effects of Pb across various developmental stages are not well understood. This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze mice brains at different ages (2 and 8 weeks) following prenatal and postnatal Pb exposure. Blood lead level in exposed mice is comparable to those detected in human samples, implying its environmental implication. A total of 43,303 brain cells were sequenced for cell-specific analysis. Pb exposure was found to elevate the proportion of immature neurons in the brains of 2 week-old mice and to perturb neurodevelopment- and neural structure-related pathways within neurons. In 8 week-old mice, Pb primarily influenced pathways implicated in synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and learning and memory in both neurons and glial cells. The communication involving neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), along with their receptors, was disrupted between neuron and microglia. Through the application of snRNA-seq, this study has demonstrated that the Pb-induced neurotoxicity is characterized by cellular heterogeneity and the disruption of neurotransmitter-related communication between microglia and neurons could be a critical factor in Pb-induced neurotoxicity."

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents to potentially reduce CO2 emissions from flue gases. However, many MOFs suffer from structural degradation and performance deterioration upon exposure to water in flue gases. Aiming to discover stable and efficient MOFs for CO2 capture from a wet flue gas, we propose a hierarchical high-throughput computational screening (HTCS) strategy. Machine learning (ML)-assisted stability analysis is incorporated within the HTCS, leveraging prior experimental experience to predict ultrastable (including water-, thermal-, and activation-stable) MOFs from ∼280,000 candidates in the ab initio REPEAT charge MOF (ARC–MOF) database. Among 9755 shortlisted MOFs, molecular simulations identify 1000 top-performing MOFs. Remarkably, several vanadium-based MOFs are revealed to be ultrastable, exhibiting high CO2 capture capability of 3–7 mmol/g and CO2/N2 selectivity of 95–401. Subsequently, ML regressors are developed to derive design principles for MOFs capable of overcoming the trade-off effect. Furthermore, an ML classifier is developed to analyze the impact of water on CO2 capture by comparing dry and wet conditions. The proposed hierarchical HTCS and developed ML models lay a solid foundation for the potential transition of MOFs into practical applications."

Here we combined the concentration with the carbon isotope analysis of DOM and its generated CO2 to quantify the contribution of •OH-based oxidation. Results showed that the 13C enrichment factors (ε values) were −8.1‰ to −8.9‰ for benzene ring oxidation in aromatic compounds, −4.2‰ to −28.9‰ for lower-molecular-weight organic acids, and −13.0‰ for DOM from sediment. The fractionation of sediment DOM reflects the average ε value of humic substances and organic acids. These ε values were more negative than those of the photochemical and microbial processes, enabling the identification of DOM transformation mechanisms. Using an end-member mix model, we found that the proportion of •OH-based mineralization in total CO2 emission ranged from 20.9% to 39.8% for 100 g/L sediment oxidation by 5–20 mM H2O2 under pH-neutral condition within 2 h and was only 2% for oxidation by air under the same conditions. We also found that inorganic carbon degassing contributed greatly to CO2 emission during sediment oxidation.

Images scored by professional histopathologists were used to train a machine learning model on hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images. The automated digital detections corresponded well with traditional assessments (between 85% and 95%) but required less expertise and were faster. Our results demonstrate a viable path toward a complete, automated workflow for fast, cost-effective and accurate digital histology analysis of environmental and ecotoxicology samples.

In this work, we use the concept of a monsoonal mode and idealized coupled simulations to show that the presence of a large land mass in the Northern Hemisphere can lead to these seasonal asymmetries. Specifically, warm air moving east from the Asian summer monsoon suppresses surface fluxes in the West Pacific, leading to increased temperature there during the following months. The warmth of the West Pacific in boreal autumn strengthens the Walker circulation and the zonal temperature gradient across the Pacific, leading to the growth of El Niño events during that season.

After ∼6000 BP, increased precipitation led to higher biomass and enhanced fire activity, with potentially higher human activities contribution.

This phenomenon can be attributed to the volume decrease and salinity increase of the Fram Strait inflow. Specifically, the Fram Strait inflow has decreased in volume by 28% (0.32 Sv/decade, responsible for AW cooling), while its salinity has increased (∼0.1 psu, resulting in the AW sinking by several tens of meters) over recent decades. Diminished Fram Strait inflow reduced the oceanic heat entering the Eurasian Basin, resulting in a lower heat content in the AW layer and potentially reducing upward heat transport, thereby contributing to the recent moderation of sea ice melting."

Based on the lower tropospheric vertical profiles and cross‐sections, three cloud‐boundary layer coupling modes are identified including a coupled mode with a weak positive surface heat flux (type 1), and two decoupled modes in the presence of either a negative surface heat flux driving a shallow stable boundary layer (type 2) or a strong positive surface heat flux (type 3). Numerical simulations are conducted for representative cases of each mode using the conventional YSU PBL scheme without and with the cloud‐induced top‐down mixing option (referred to as YSUtopdown), as well as the MYNN and the MYNN eddy‐diffusivity mass‐flux scheme (MYNN‐EDMF) that adopts a holistic treatment of mixed‐layer thermals and shallow convective clouds. The MYNN‐EDMF scheme offers the best representation of the decoupled type 3 mode where its capability to simulate different vertical extents of local mixing and nonlocal mass flux is found to be essential. Two key parameters in MYNN‐EDMF dictating shallow cloud formation are also identified.

 With the material system operating at lower temperatures, protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) can offer high energy efficiency and reliable performance for both power generation and hydrogen production, making them a promising technology for reversible energy cycling. However, PCEC faces technical challenges, particularly regarding electrode activity and durability under high current density operations. To address these challenges, we introduce a nano-architecture oxygen electrode characterized by high porosity and triple conductivity, designed to enhance catalytic activity and interfacial stability through a self-assembly approach, while maintaining scalability. Electrochemical cells incorporating this advanced electrode demonstrate robust performance, achieving a peak power density of 1.50 W cm⁻2 at 600 °C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 5.04 A cm−2 at 1.60 V in electrolysis mode, with enhanced stability on transient operations and thermal cycles. The underlying mechanisms are closely related to the improved surface activity and mass transfer due to the dual features of the electrode structure. Additionally, the enhanced interfacial bonding between the oxygen electrode and electrolyte contributes to increased durability and thermomechanical integrity. This study underscores the critical importance of optimizing electrode microstructure to achieve a balance between surface activity and durability.

 Attaching fluorescent dyes to biomolecules is essential for assays in biology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomedicine and imaging. A systematic approach for the selection of suitable labeling sites in macromolecules, particularly proteins, is missing. We present a quantitative strategy to identify such protein residues using a naïve Bayes classifier. Analysis of >100 proteins with ~400 successfully labeled residues allows to identify four parameters, which can rank residues via a single metric (the label score). The approach is tested and benchmarked by inspection of literature data and experiments on the expression level, degree of labelling, and success in FRET assays of different bacterial substrate binding proteins.

The technique is scalable, cost effective, and could enable advanced sensors, clocks, and communication technologies. 
 Incorporating rare-earth elements into wurtzite nitride semiconductors, such as scandium-alloyed aluminum nitride (ScAlN), significantly enhances the piezoelectric response, which is vital for a broad range of acoustic, electronic, photonic, and quantum applications. To date, however, the measured piezoelectric response of nitride semiconductors is far below what theory has predicted. Herein, we demonstrate a simple, scalable, post-growth thermal annealing process that can dramatically boost the piezoelectric response of ScAlN. We achieve a 3.5-fold increase in the piezoelectric modulus, d33 for ScAlN, from 12.3 pC/N in the as-grown state to 45.5 pC/N, which is eight times larger than that of AlN commercially used in 5 G cellphones. The observed enhancement is unambiguously confirmed by three separate measurement techniques. Detailed material characterization techniques reveal that optimized annealing conditions significantly improve the macroscopic structural quality, achieving a more homogeneous and ordered domain orientation, and reduces the lattice parameter ratio (c/a) in the wurtzite crystal structure. The dramatic enhancement of d33 in ScAlN thin films promises extreme frequency scaling opportunities for bulk acoustic wave resonators for beyond-5 G applications.

These liposomal LNPs exhibit longer circulation lifetimes than LNP systems with Onpattro-like lipid compositions and have enhanced extrahepatic transfection properties. The prolonged blood circulation lifetime is attributed to reduced plasma protein adsorption.

 Polyamines play essential roles in gene expression and modulate neuronal transmission in mammals.

 Plant physiological responses to rising CO2 have been shown to contribute to increasing extreme heat; but their impacts on co-occurrences of high heat and humidity have not been assessed previously. Since heat stress depends on both, reductions in evapotranspiration and increases in sensible heat can incite competing influences on co-occurrence metrics (e.g., heat index). Here we analyze plant physiological forcing in idealized simulations that isolate plant physiological from radiative impacts of rising CO2. Our results demonstrate that increasing temperature has a larger influence than declining moisture, leading to overall CMIP6 multi-model mean heat index increases. Model differences are driven by varying levels of transpiration decline, which can be partially offset by leaf-area-driven increases in canopy evaporation in some models/regions; as highlighted by differences between two versions of one model (CESM) with high and low levels of leaf-area change.

 Summer monsoon breaks can have far-reaching impacts by triggering abnormal weather both locally and remotely. However, their formation mechanisms remain incompletely understood, with intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) widely recognized as a primary driver. This study investigates South China Sea monsoon break events and finds that 72.9% originate from the Philippine Sea, associated with ISOs, while the residual 27.1% are locally generated, which have yet to be elucidated previously. Our results suggest that these locally generated events are often preceded by anomalously active tropical cyclones, which amplify in situ air–sea interaction, inducing SST cooling that increases large-scale atmospheric stability, thereby promoting monsoon break establishment. Moreover, differing from ISO-related monsoon breaks that increase precipitation over the Yangtze River Valley, locally generated breaks induce significant warming over South China.

 Sea ice and snow are crucial components of the cryosphere and the climate system. Both sea ice and spring snow in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) have been decreasing at an alarming rate in a changing climate. Changes in NH sea ice and snow have been linked with a variety of climate and weather extremes including cold spells, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires. Understanding of these linkages will benefit the predictions of climate and weather extremes. However, existing work on this has been largely fragmented and is subject to large uncertainties in physical pathways and methodologies. This has prevented further substantial progress in attributing climate and weather extremes to sea ice and snow change, and will potentially risk the loss of a critical window for effective climate change mitigation. In this review, we synthesize the current progress in attributing climate and weather extremes to sea ice and snow change by evaluating the observed linkages, their physical pathways and uncertainties in these pathways, and suggesting ways forward for future research efforts. By adopting the same framework for both sea ice and snow, we highlight their combined influence and the cryospheric feedback to the climate system. We suggest that future research will benefit from improving observational networks, addressing the causality and complexity of the linkages using multiple lines of evidence, adopting large-ensemble approaches and artificial intelligence, achieving synergy between different methodologies/disciplines, widening the context, and coordinated international collaboration."

 Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) is a directional variable and has significant angular anisotropy. This characteristic contributes to enhance the differences among different satellite-derived LST products, and therefore increases the challenge of using multi-sensor and multi-decadal data to provide a long-term and angle-consistent LST climate data record. The kernel-driven model can balance the interpretability and operability well, so that it is suitable for angular normalization of LST products. The calibration of the kernel-driven model depends on multi-angle data which is difficult to obtain due to the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of LST. In this study, a novel LST angular normalization method based on the kernel-driven model was proposed to correct the angular effect of satellite-derived LST product by constructing multi-angle LST dataset from one geostationary satellite (GOES-R/ABI) and four polar-orbiting satellites (Terra/MODIS, Aqua/MODIS, Metop/AVHRR, and S-NPP/VIIRS). The dataset gathered more abundant angle information, i.e., LSTs from three different observation geometries for the same pixel. The kernel-driven model was calibrated using the multi-angle LST dataset in the Continental United States (CONUS) during the year 2020. The discrepancies of the root mean square difference between LST before and after angular normalization range from 0.14 K to 1.10 K over nine land cover types in the four seasons. Similar results are obtained when the calibrated kernel-driven model was further expanded to other years and areas (i.e., the CONUS in 2021 and East Asia in 2020). The LST angular normalization method was applied to correct the angular effect of MODIS LST product. The results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the spatial distribution of LST differences (LST before and after angular normalization) and view zenith angle (VZA). MODIS LSTs before and after angular normalization were compared with Landsat 8 LST and Sentinel-3 A LST in near-nadir viewing for January, April, July, and October 2020. The angular normalization reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) between MODIS LST and Landsat 8 LST by 0.94–2.06 K in different months and by 0.13–2.61 K over various land cover types. For Sentinel-3 A, the RMSE decreased by 0.30–0.64 K in different months. The accuracies of MODIS LST before and after angular normalization were further validated using in situ measurements at the six SURFRAD sites. There are large discrepancies between the RMSE of MODIS LST before and after angular normalization versus in situ LST for VZA ≥ 45°. The largest discrepancy is up to approximately 1.3 K at the GWN site. The LST angular normalization method has the potential to provide an angle-consistent LST climate data record."

 The Gálvez-Davison Index (GDI) was developed to enhance forecasting capabilities of tropical convection. This study evaluates the applicability of the GDI in forecasting deep tropical and subtropical convection, particularly in synoptic scale systems, such as the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), and mesoscale phenomena like Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCC). A hybrid methodology was applied, integrating retrospective and prospective analyses. Initially, a statistical evaluation of the GDI was conducted over the historical period from 1994 to 2024, using convection proxies including omega (vertical velocity) at 500 hPa and net longwave radiation flux (LWR). Subsequently, a brief diagnostic of SACZ and MCC events, which occurred respectively in January 2024 and October 2016, was performed. Based on these events, GDI forecasts derived from the Global Forecast System (GFS) model were compared against satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data within the affected regions. Key results demonstrated that, as expected, the GDI performed better in tropical than subtropical regions, showing stronger correlations with convection proxies. Statistical analysis for the SACZ (tropical region) indicated a strong negative correlation between the GDI and omega at 500 hPa (R=−0.93). Conversely, the correlation between GDI and omega at 500 hPa was weaker for MCC events (subtropical region; R=−0.21), highlighting a greater influence of dynamic factors in these systems. The GDI successfully identified regions prone to deep convection, particularly within the SACZ domain, where high GDI values coincided with regions of instability and intense precipitation. For MCC events, the index effectively captured convective intensification in subtropical regions. Forecasts of the GDI were reliable in regions where SACZ and MCC systems were active, as validated by satellite imagery. However, high index values were also recorded in areas without actual convection, indicating potential limitations. Comparison between GFS forecasts and ERA5 reanalysis revealed a systematic tendency of the global model to underestimate GDI values across all analyzed regions. The root mean square error (RMSE) varied regionally, reaching a maximum of 6.75 in the oceanic portion of the SACZ. Overall, the GDI proved valuable in forecasting deep convection, capturing both intensification and dissipation stages of convective systems. Its use as a complementary tool is promising, although systematic underestimation by the GFS highlights the need for model improvements.

 Low clouds are essential to the energy budget and the hydrological cycle, but simulation of low clouds in most AGCMs (atmospheric general circulation models) remains a challenge. The critical relative humidity (RHc) has great significance for cloud parameterization. Based on diagnostic results of CloudSat/CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite data, we propose a fourth-order curve-fitting formula for RHc with respect to temperature (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.9659). The method was implemented in CAM6 (Community Atmosphere Model, version 6). Compared with the original scheme, the dynamic RHc significantly reduces the negative bias of low clouds over mid- and low-latitude oceans, increases the low cloud fraction by 20 %. Furthermore, the dynamic RHc has an impact on the vertical distribution of cloud amount, significantly increasing the cloud fraction below 700 hPa and reducing it above 400 hPa. The increase in low clouds is accompanied by an increase in liquid water path, which helps reduce the shortwave cloud forcing bias in the subtropics. Besides, the change in cloud fraction caused by the dynamic RHc has an impact on the simulation of precipitation. Finally, the simulation results at 1° and 2° indicate that the method is insensitive to the choice of model resolution."

 The general surface temperature is influenced by changes in air temperature and is affected by local factors. The Tibetan Plateau, characterized by its high altitude and intense solar radiation, shows substantial effects related to slope orientation. Slope orientation plays a crucial role in controlling the absorption and reflection of solar radiation, leading to variations in surface temperatures across various slope orientations and complicating the relationship between surface and air temperatures. This study focused on air temperature and slope orientation. Considering atmospheric parameters such as solar altitude angle (h), solar declination angle (δ), hour angle (ψ), and local geographical parameters like latitude and longitude. We proposed a novel method for estimating surface temperature on slopes based on air temperature, validated using measured data from the established octagonal platform at the Huashixia permafrost observation station in the Tibetan Plateau. Results indicated that at a significance level of P < 0.05, the highest correlation coefficient and linear fitting coefficient (R2) calculated using daily average air temperature were 0.89 and 0.79, respectively. When applying monthly average air temperature, these values were 0.99 and 0.98. This demonstrated that using monthly average air temperature as an inversion parameter yielded high-accuracy near-surface temperatures. The study will provide important guidance for optimizing design parameters and setting boundary conditions for stability prediction models for railways, highways, and other infrastructure under different orientations."

Ross,Characterizing the expression profile of 3R tau pathology in Pick’s disease,"Pick’s disease (PiD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder defined by dementia, frontotemporal lobe atrophy, and 3-repeat tau inclusions. To elucidate PiD pathobiology, we performed the first bulk transcriptomics study on PiD using short- and long-read sequencing on the parietal cortex of 28 PiD and 15 control samples. We identified several significantly differentially expressed genes, withCCL2displaying the strongest association with 3-repeat tau pathology and increased burden in PiD compared to those in 4-repeat tau progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cases. Investigation of co-expressed genes and pathways suggested the involvement of mRNA processing, mitochondrial function, and immune processes in disease pathobiology. Long-read RNA sequencing on a subset of samples (eight PiD and four control) proposed novel, potentially disease-associated transcripts forAZGP1,CD44,HSD11B2, andWIF1, predicted to result in truncated proteins. In conclusion, we observed transcriptomic changes in the parietal cortex of patients with PiD that may inform into clinically relevant biomarkers and therapeutic strategies."

LINE-1 encodes two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, both essential for successful retrotransposition. ORF2p has endonuclease and reverse transcription activity, while ORF1p binds RNA. Many copies of ORF1p assemble onto the LINE-1 RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensate. However, the function of these condensates in the LINE-1 life cycle remains unclear. Using reconstitution assays on DNA curtains, we show that L1 RNP condensates gain DNA binding activity only when RNA is super-saturated with ORF1p. In cells, L1 RNP condensates bind to chromosomes during mitosis. Mutational analysis reveals that DNA binding is crucial for nuclear entry and LINE-1 retrotransposition activity. Thus, a key function of ORF1p is to form an RNP condensate that gains access to the genome through DNA binding upon nuclear envelope breakdown."

We identify elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor–1 (PAI-1) and, notably, its strong correlation with inflammation in arterial thrombosis. To address this, small molecular inhibitors of PAI-1 and inflammation are used as bioregulators to restore vascular homeostasis. We design a carrier-free supramolecular system based on the bioregulators-tuned self-assembly of a near-infrared thrombus probe, which preferentially forms protein corona in situ to enhance plasma stability. Under acidic conditions and increased shear stress, the supramolecular assemblies disintegrate, enabling site-specific cargo release. In vivo, the probe accumulates 22.8-fold more in the thrombotic than contralateral artery. Functionally, this nanomedicine improves outcomes in mice with carotid artery thrombosis and chronic cerebral ischemia. Mechanistically, it down-regulates NF-κB signaling, inhibits NETosis and glycolysis, and up-regulates cGMP-mediated signaling, thereby alleviating inflammation and promoting fibrinolysis. This study offers an innovative codelivery strategy using supramolecular assemblies to advance therapies for arterial thrombosis."

Our study investigates neurotransmitter modulation of ACOD1 expression, a regulator of immunometabolism activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Screening neurotransmitters identifies dopamine as a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced ACOD1 expression in innate immune cells. Mechanistically, DRD2 forms a complex with TLR4, initiating MAPK3-dependent CREB1 phosphorylation and subsequent ACOD1 transcription. Conversely, dopamine disrupts TLR4-MYD88 interaction via DRD2 without affecting the formation of the LPS-induced TLR4-MD2-CD14 complex. Enhanced ACOD1 expression induces CD274/PD-L1 production independently of itaconate, precipitating inflammation-associated immunosuppression in sepsis. Delayed administration of pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, mitigates lethality in bacterial sepsis mouse models. Conversely, the dopamine antagonist aripiprazole exacerbates sepsis mortality. Dysregulation of the dopamine-ACOD1 axis correlates with sepsis severity in patients, indicating a potential therapeutic target for modulating this neuroimmune pathway."

Proxy data from the middle to late Miocene reveal that large-scale cooling and drying occurred; however, the reasons for this climate transition remain unclear. Through a compilation of proxy data and climate simulations, our results indicate that atmospheric CO2decline markedly decreased the temperature and reduced the precipitation in most of the land area, while the paleogeographic changes enhanced cooling at northern high latitudes and increased precipitation in East Asia, East Africa, and South America. In comparison, vegetation changes accelerated cooling at northern high latitudes (the maximum cooling exceeded 10°C) and modulated precipitation at low- and mid-latitude continents (the maximum decrease was close to 30%).

However, the precise structure of their polyamide selective layer under hydrated conditions and its relationship to membrane transport remain poorly understood. Using cryo–electron tomography, we successfully reconstructed the three-dimensional structure of six commercial polyamide membranes under hydrated conditions, revealing a fully swollen nodular network. The highly heterogeneous nodules, measuring 17.2 ± 2.8 nanometer in thickness, were directly connected to the pores of the underlying polysulfone substrate. The nodules occupied most of the surface area compared to the 75.9 ± 26.8-nanometer-thick dense layer of the polyamide film. Key structural parameters of the nodules, including surface area index and wall thickness, were correlated with the water permeance of an additional 16 polyamide membranes, validating the major role of these nodules in water transport.
